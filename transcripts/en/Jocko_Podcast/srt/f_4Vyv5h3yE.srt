00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,940
This is Jocko podcast number
15 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:11,410
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:16,890
I looked around at the men.

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:19,760
Yeah,

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,890
I was the only one looking around.

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,750
All the other heads were bowed down.
All of them

7
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,163
praying.

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,120
These men were going into battle.
Real battle.

9
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,080
We could literally hear machine gun fire
in the distance where the battle would

10
00:00:41,081 --> 00:00:42,010
take place.

11
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:46,090
These men had suffered an
incredible number of casualties.

12
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,530
They had every reason to pray.

13
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,870
I was with Charlie company

14
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,610
from one of the most hallowed
units in the u s military.

15
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,350
The first of the five oh six the
band of brothers made famous by their

16
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,870
unbelievable performance in World War II,

17
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,380
which was documented in
the book band of brothers,

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,440
which became an HBO mini
series of the same name.

19
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,390
The first of the five oh six in Ramadi
held the line on that tradition of glory

20
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,580
and service and courage.

21
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:29,950
There's nothing I can say that
will do justice to the end, to the,

22
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:34,980
to the admiration and the respect that
I had for the first of the five oh six

23
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,370
and that all of us seals had
for the first of the five oh six

24
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:47,970
the seals that I sent to work directly
with the five oh six they became adopted

25
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:55,390
by the five oh six red Currahee. That's
one of the nicknames for the five Oh six

26
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,360
and the seals that were directly,

27
00:02:01,361 --> 00:02:05,680
they're working with them absolutely
loved the five oh six the Bible six

28
00:02:05,681 --> 00:02:08,500
represented everything good.

29
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:12,790
I can imagine in a
military team or any team,

30
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,100
professional and disciplined
and motivated and creative.

31
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:25,380
The leadership in the battalion
was absolutely outstanding.

32
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,780
The battalion commander,

33
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,770
he was the very essence of leadership.

34
00:02:33,771 --> 00:02:38,771
He was calm and direct and friendly and
open minded and respectful and respected

35
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,290
and his staff and the company
commanders in the senior NCO,

36
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:52,160
they had this unified thread between them,

37
00:02:52,161 --> 00:02:54,200
this bond,
this connection,

38
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,120
and it was that tradition in that sense,

39
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,400
purpose and that standard of
excellence and professionalism.

40
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,990
It's hard to describe,

41
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:12,270
but it was absolutely there and it was
as real as the sand and the bullets and

42
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:14,800
the guns.

43
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,540
And so there I was,

44
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:24,100
and this was early in my deployment to
Ramadi with task unit bruiser and I was

45
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:28,330
about to go out into the [inaudible]
district with Charlie Company

46
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,490
and their company commander
was just an outstanding guy.

47
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,020
And I knew that this unit in this company,
in this battalion,

48
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:44,800
I knew it was something special
and I knew that that term,

49
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,390
the band of brothers,

50
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,980
I knew that that's what they truly were.

51
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,880
And we hear it and I know it's a book
in, it's uh, it's a, it's an HBO series,

52
00:03:57,881 --> 00:03:58,714
but

53
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,910
where does it come from now most
people have heard that simple quote,

54
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,960
we few,
we happy few.

55
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:13,110
We band of brothers for he today that
sheds his blood with me shall be my

56
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:15,130
brother.

57
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:23,920
And I knew what that quote was.
I knew where it came from.

58
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:29,500
I was an English major in college
and I knew that that was Shakespeare.

59
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,870
And I knew that that was Henry the fifth.

60
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:40,350
And I knew how powerful that quote was.

61
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,720
Now when you start talking
about Shakespeare and you
start talking about Henry

62
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:48,790
the fifth, there's all kinds of
different directions you can go

63
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:53,710
because you can go back and you can
look at what Henry the fifth was like in

64
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:54,311
real life.

65
00:04:54,311 --> 00:04:59,230
And if he was like the leader that
Shakespeare made him into into play.

66
00:04:59,231 --> 00:05:03,010
And you could talk about Shakespeare
himself and the rumors and the,

67
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,630
and the myths and the lay,

68
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,710
the legends that circulate
his life and his legacy.

69
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,750
Because there's all kinds of
questions about Shakespeare. I mean,

70
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:19,240
did he actually write all of his place?
Was He more than one person?

71
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:20,770
Was he a soldier at some point?

72
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:24,610
How did he know all this stuff about the
military and what it was like to be a

73
00:05:24,611 --> 00:05:25,444
soldier?

74
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:31,720
Was his vocabulary 10 times
what a normal person is?

75
00:05:31,721 --> 00:05:34,300
There's all kinds of,
like I said,

76
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,590
rumor and myth about Shakespeare,

77
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,060
but instead of talking about all that and,

78
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,970
and the conjecture and the
hypothetical questions,

79
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,080
I would rather talk about
something that is known,

80
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,620
something that we have today.

81
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,160
And those are the words,

82
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,190
words from the play.
Henry the fifth,

83
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,520
which yes was written by Shakespeare,
and

84
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,490
I'm going to tell you, don't be scared
and don't be intimidated by that.

85
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,630
I mean don't be scared and
don't be intimidated by
Shakespeare because you don't

86
00:06:20,841 --> 00:06:25,580
understand it because you can't.
Then the fact of the matter is

87
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,440
no one can,
at least at first,

88
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:35,810
it's not possible to understand
Shakespeare out of the gate.

89
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,490
It doesn't work. It's a
nother language. It's,

90
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:44,900
it's, it is a another language. You
can't be expected to understand it.

91
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,040
It's written in something
called early modern English.

92
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:53,120
You don't we speak English.
This is early modern English,

93
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,260
which is just a transition from
something called middle English,

94
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:01,940
and if you go on youtube and you look
up middle English and you have somebody

95
00:07:01,941 --> 00:07:06,140
read, a real common one is, if you look
at the Lord's prayer in middle English,

96
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,780
you can barely understand it.
Parts of it,

97
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:11,180
you can't understand parts
of the world you recognize,

98
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,850
but when you get to early modern
English now with a step closer,

99
00:07:16,851 --> 00:07:20,300
but it still is. There's,
there's, it's different.

100
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:24,080
It's a different type of language and
there's archaic words and there's obsolete

101
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:26,600
words and there's words that
Shakespeare just made up.

102
00:07:26,601 --> 00:07:29,540
He would make up words factually.

103
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,220
And the patterns of speech are different
in the idioms are different and the

104
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:37,190
references are all historical.

105
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,400
And so if you don't have a grasp on those
mythological references and historical

106
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:46,640
references and biblical references than
it doesn't have the meaning that it's

107
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:47,480
supposed to have.

108
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:52,540
So you can't expect just to open up
Shakespeare and be able to understand it.

109
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:58,190
Now this is actually the opposite of
what I often say because to me, you know,

110
00:07:58,191 --> 00:08:01,760
you hear me say all the time that what
makes English show important is that you

111
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:04,940
can make things very simple and
very understandable by everybody.

112
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:08,360
So then why is it important?
Why should we read it?

113
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,040
Why should we try and understand it?

114
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,790
And the answer that question
is actually very simple.

115
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,340
Shakespeare had something,

116
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:32,030
he had something, he had some
understanding, some knowledge,

117
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,283
some,

118
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,320
some insight into the human
mind that is not normal.

119
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,970
It's not normal.
He understood people

120
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,460
deeply.
You understood relationships,

121
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:53,840
he understood leadership, he
understood love. And he understood war,

122
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:58,110
and I don't know how he did this and
I'm going to why he did, but he did.

123
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,740
And on top of that,
he had this talent.

124
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,290
He had this gift to translate
that knowledge into words.

125
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:15,150
And this is important because in the
late 15 hundreds in the early 16 hundreds

126
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,200
this is a whole nother deal.
There's no special effects.

127
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:23,400
There's no close up shots of an actor.
There's no stunt man,

128
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:24,990
there's no CGI.

129
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,600
Everything has to be
contained in the words,

130
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:35,580
all the emotion and all the feeling
and all they action and all the nature

131
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,490
of human beings.

132
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:42,120
It all has to be captured in the words.

133
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:48,450
And the words that
Shakespeare uses are heavy

134
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:51,880
and they're also,

135
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:56,940
they're power regnant their power regnant
with so much more meaning than what's

136
00:09:57,641 --> 00:09:58,540
on the surface.

137
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:04,350
They're filled with depth and knowledge
that you have to scrape away and uncover

138
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,780
to figure out what they're
even talking about.

139
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,530
But let's,
let's take a look at this,

140
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,570
this famous speech in Henry,
the fifth,

141
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:26,760
the play,
the same name

142
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:34,590
and I'm going to lead into it a little
bit just to kind of at least set the

143
00:10:35,741 --> 00:10:40,690
context of what's happening. And
as I did, as I went into my notes,

144
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:42,910
just the opening,

145
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,390
when you've got this guy that kind of
comes out and describes to you what's

146
00:10:46,391 --> 00:10:50,590
going to happen in the play
in the end,

147
00:10:50,591 --> 00:10:54,310
he kind of introduces Henry,
they call him Harry

148
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,810
and he introduces him with this line.

149
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,870
Then should the war like Harry,

150
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:09,930
like himself assume the port of Mars
and at his heels leached in like hounds

151
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,280
should famine,

152
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,870
sword and fire crouch forward employment.

153
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,800
So if you break that down,

154
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:29,210
first of all he's coming out of the great
out of the gate he's saying Harry is

155
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,410
warlike,

156
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:37,330
which means he's fond of war and skilled
in it and equipped for it and in a more

157
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:43,430
literal meaning,
it's saying Henry is like war himself,

158
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:51,010
which means he has complexities and the
and the youth and the mayhem and the

159
00:11:51,351 --> 00:11:53,360
chaos inside himself.

160
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,970
And then it goes on to say that
he should assume the port of Mars,

161
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,810
which means he should take
on the bearing of Mars,

162
00:12:01,811 --> 00:12:06,520
which is the Roman God
of war and at his heels.

163
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:11,000
So, so down now by his
feet. Leashed in hounds.

164
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,920
So you've got dogs,
angry dogs on leashes,

165
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,930
and those dogs are famine,
sword and fire.

166
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:25,410
And in those days that was war because
when you did siege warfare on somebody,

167
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,470
you locked down their castle,
you starve them.

168
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,330
And once they were weekend,

169
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,320
you burned their castle and then
use the sword to finish him off.

170
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,440
So he had those dogs of war at his side
and they were crouched for employment.

171
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:47,530
If you could imagine a pit bull just
tents and coiled like a spring ready to

172
00:12:47,531 --> 00:12:48,364
pounce.

173
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:56,580
That's the opening to describe Henry.

174
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,443
So

175
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,480
they're at war with France and they go
to take down this town of horror fleur.

176
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,390
And at this point,

177
00:13:18,391 --> 00:13:23,391
this is one of the other really famous
speeches from Henry the fifth and at this

178
00:13:23,941 --> 00:13:26,850
point they've broken through
the walls and there's a,

179
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:30,060
there's a breach in the wall. So
there's a, there's a hole in the wall,

180
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,280
but the French are still defending it.

181
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,620
The French are still
defending it pretty well.

182
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,470
And so Henry has a little
chat with his troopers.

183
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,660
And this is a pretty famous speech.

184
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,330
And he says once more unto the breach,
dear friends,

185
00:13:45,331 --> 00:13:49,290
once more or close the wall
up with our English dead.

186
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,540
So he's saying that hole in the wall,

187
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:56,570
charge it charge at and either get through
it or fill up the wall with our dead.

188
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:06,030
And then he says in peace there's nothing
so becomes a man as modest stillness

189
00:14:07,091 --> 00:14:10,810
and humility. So when things
are, when things are peaceful,

190
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,070
being calm and being
humble is a good thing.

191
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:21,370
But when the blast of
war blows in our ears,

192
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:24,160
then imitate the action of the tiger.

193
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:30,270
So when war comes, nevermind peace and
calm, it's time to be like a tiger.

194
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,500
And he says, stiff in the
sinews. Summon up the blood,

195
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,520
disguise fair nature
with hard favored rage.

196
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:46,600
So tense your body and
summing up your rage.

197
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:53,240
Then lend the I a terrible aspect.

198
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:58,160
Let pry through the portage of the head,
like the brass cannon.

199
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,580
Let the brow overwhelm it.

200
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:06,460
So what he's saying there is furrow your
brow and let your eye poke through your

201
00:15:08,661 --> 00:15:10,400
brow.
Like a cannon,

202
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:14,930
like a brass cannon
sticking out of a porthole

203
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,060
as fearfully as Dothan
Gollad rock overhang.

204
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:26,080
And Judie is confounded based swilled
with the wild and wasteful ocean.

205
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,800
So he's saying,
make your brow over,

206
00:15:28,801 --> 00:15:32,930
hang your eyes like a rock that
Drudge's out over the wild ocean.

207
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:41,610
And then now set the teeth
and stretch the nostril wide.

208
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:46,370
Hold hard the breadth and bend up
every spirit to its full height.

209
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:51,590
So you know what that one is?
Bite down. Grit your teeth,

210
00:15:51,591 --> 00:15:52,820
flair your nostrils.

211
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Take a deep breath and hold it in and
bring every emotion you have to its utmost

212
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,110
and like, like a, like a tension on a bow

213
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,260
on, on, you know, balist English,

214
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:13,820
whose blood is Fed from
fathers of war proof fathers.

215
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:19,090
Like so many Alexander's having these
parts from morning till even fought and

216
00:16:21,051 --> 00:16:26,000
she their swords for lack of
argument. So he's saying, listen,

217
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,210
you gotta fight,
you gotta fight you.

218
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:36,250
You Englishman whose blood is from
combat tested warriors like Alexander the

219
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,463
Great

220
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:46,040
and those men have fought on this
soil from morning until night forever.

221
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,160
And they only she their swords when
there was no one else to fight.

222
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,930
Do not dishonor your mothers.

223
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:01,070
Now a test that whom you
called fathers did beget you

224
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,760
don't dishonor your mom.

225
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:09,860
Prove that your father with his
warrior blood is really your father.

226
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:16,750
Be Copy now to men of grocer
blood and teach them how to war.

227
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:23,150
And that means being an
example to the lesser man,

228
00:17:23,151 --> 00:17:27,170
to the weaker man and show them how to war

229
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:34,010
and you good yeoman who's
limbs were made in England?

230
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:37,520
Show us here the metal of your pasture.

231
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,500
So yeoman,

232
00:17:39,501 --> 00:17:43,300
we're basically like the troopers that
foot soldiers in the archers and he's

233
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:48,310
saying show us how you were
born in England and the pasture.

234
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,230
That's where you were raised like
a cow was raised on a pasture.

235
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,380
Show us what the metal of that pasture is.

236
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,150
Let us swear that you are
worth for your breeding,

237
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:03,930
which I doubt not for
there is none of you.

238
00:18:03,931 --> 00:18:08,931
So mean and base that half not
know baluster in your eyes.

239
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,520
So no matter where these guys are from,

240
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,870
no matter what level of society
they're they they came from,

241
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:21,290
he sees the noble luster in the
righteous gleam in their eyes.

242
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,050
I see you stand like
grey hounds in the slips,

243
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,330
straining upon the start

244
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,470
now grey hounds, you know,
now we use them for racing.

245
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:42,540
They used to be used to have
to run down animals and a slip

246
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,260
is, and this is one of those
things, you've got to look this up.

247
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,390
I didn't know this,
I looked it up today.

248
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:54,320
A slip is an old kind of leash that they
used for hunting dogs that when you,

249
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,520
it was very,
you could,

250
00:18:56,521 --> 00:18:59,430
you could basically hit a switch
and it would let the dog go.

251
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:03,150
So here are these pictures of these
greyhounds that are in these quick release

252
00:19:03,151 --> 00:19:03,984
leashes,

253
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:09,110
but they're straining on them weeding to
go on the hunt to go in and chase down

254
00:19:09,751 --> 00:19:13,590
their prey.
And the next line is the game's afoot.

255
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:17,580
Follow your spirit and upon this charge,

256
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,050
cry God for Harry England and St George.

257
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:26,610
So he says the game's afoot, meaning
that the animal that you're hunting,

258
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,653
it's out there.

259
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,200
Follow your spirit and
then go and get after it.

260
00:19:34,111 --> 00:19:35,610
And as you get after it,

261
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:41,420
Yell God for Harry England
and St George and St Georges,

262
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:45,570
St George's, the patron saint
of England, the dragon slayer,

263
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,490
who was an executed Christian martyr.

264
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,073
So

265
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:59,430
you can see that there's so much insight,
these words,

266
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,300
and he captures some of the brutality

267
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:09,570
of war.
And so what happens now is they,

268
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:14,460
they get the village that they're trying
to take down and they've, you know,

269
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,370
put a lot of pressure on.
They've gone through the breach,

270
00:20:17,371 --> 00:20:20,700
they've gotten fight back,
but now they've got them on the lockdown

271
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:27,490
and
he's telling them,

272
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,920
he tells the governor,

273
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:36,270
Henry tells the governor that he needs
to surrender before Henry loses control

274
00:20:39,581 --> 00:20:43,990
of his own men. This is a scary
thing. This is like, you know, hey,

275
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:46,240
if you don't surrender now, I'm not
gonna have control anymore. Right?

276
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,940
Over these guys,
these barbarians at the gate,

277
00:20:48,941 --> 00:20:51,640
they're going to come and I'm not going
to have control over them anymore.

278
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,880
He says,
yes,

279
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:00,080
the gates of mercy shall be all shut up
and the flesh should soldier rough and

280
00:21:01,711 --> 00:21:05,550
hard of heart. And by the
way flesh. It is an old word.

281
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:09,150
It means excited by the taste of flesh.

282
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,360
So he's saying these soldiers who are
excited by the taste of flesh in liberty

283
00:21:15,721 --> 00:21:20,721
of bloody hand sell shall range
with conscience wide as hell.

284
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,350
So in liberty of bloody hand,
you know what that means?

285
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,530
It means our hands already
covered in blood. I'm good.

286
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:33,240
I'm just going to go forward. I don't
care anymore. I don't care anymore

287
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,530
with conscious wide as hell.
Mowing like grass,

288
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:44,360
your fresh fare virgins
and your flowering infants.

289
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:50,820
So we are going to come and we
are going to mow like grass.

290
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,100
Your virgin is and your children.
That's that.

291
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,083
Okay.

292
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:04,190
He goes on trying to convince them again,
this is his key point is like,

293
00:22:04,191 --> 00:22:08,000
listen, I have control of these
guys right now and he goes on,

294
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,380
therefore you men of horror,
fleur,

295
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:14,390
take pity on your town
and have your people.

296
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:19,450
Whilst yet my soldiers are in my command
wiles yet the cool and to wind of grace

297
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:28,900
or blows the fill fee and contain
just clouds of heady murder,

298
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,220
spoil and villainy.

299
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,510
So he's saying like right now there's,

300
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,930
there's a cool breeze of
peace and grace with my guys,

301
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:44,260
but some contagious clouds are coming
of murder and spoil and villainy and,

302
00:22:47,281 --> 00:22:52,000
and the word to use this heady
is it means intoxicating,

303
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:54,250
meaning these kinds are
going to lose their minds

304
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,720
if not,
why in a moment,

305
00:23:00,721 --> 00:23:05,721
look to see the blind and bloody soldier
with foul hand desire the locks of your

306
00:23:07,951 --> 00:23:09,900
shrill shrieking daughters.

307
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:15,240
Your father's taken by the silver beards
and their most river reverend heads

308
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,130
dash to the walls,

309
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:21,670
blind and bloody show to get.

310
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:26,690
It's like blind with rage and
blind with murder and foul hands.

311
00:23:27,651 --> 00:23:32,210
He's telling them this,
you're naked infants.

312
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,700
Spitted upon pikes

313
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:43,100
in spitted by the way,
is a

314
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:48,260
methodology used in this time period
for cooking small game, small animals.

315
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:53,470
And it means you put the animal on a
pole from mouth to rectum and he's saying

316
00:23:53,561 --> 00:23:55,160
they're going to do this to their children

317
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:03,360
walls. The madd, mothers
with their howls, confused,

318
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,370
do break the clouds,

319
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:10,550
as did the wives of jewelry at how at
Harrods bloody hunting slaughterman so

320
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:15,210
break the clouds.
That means cries to the Madd.

321
00:24:15,211 --> 00:24:18,240
Mothers are going to go mad with tiers

322
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:24,660
like they did in the Bible in Matthew
Two 16. That's what this is referring to.

323
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:29,850
When King Herod ordered the slaughter
of all boys under the age of two in

324
00:24:29,851 --> 00:24:30,684
Bethlehem,

325
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,220
this is like a threat that they're
going to kill all the children.

326
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,780
So Henry the fifth is bringing it
home.

327
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,030
What say you,

328
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:47,810
will you yield and of this avoid or
guilty in defense be thus destroyed.

329
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,190
So the

330
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:01,400
French hearing these pretty
valid threats coming, uh,

331
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,220
they surrender.
They

332
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:10,470
Henry and the troops take that village
and then the next thing they do is march

333
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:11,161
in.
And again,

334
00:25:11,161 --> 00:25:16,161
I'm moving rapidly through a real war
that took place and they end up settling

335
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:21,330
on the opposing ends of a field,

336
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:24,150
which is now what's becomes the,

337
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,740
the famous battle of it.

338
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,760
Some people call it as in court
or Agincourt and the French,

339
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:38,550
they, they got more people.
I mean, it's in France.

340
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,840
So they've got more people,
substantially more people.

341
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:44,940
And there's a bunch of different,
you are on the books, I've read,

342
00:25:44,941 --> 00:25:49,890
there's varying numbers, but they
definitely had substantially more people.

343
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,850
And Henry,
he's talking to some of his leadership,

344
00:25:56,851 --> 00:25:58,200
his subordinate commanders,

345
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:02,490
and then they all kind of walk off the
stage and he's left there and he starts

346
00:26:02,491 --> 00:26:06,030
talking a little bit about
the burden of command and,

347
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:09,810
and some thoughts on leadership,
which I was,

348
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,360
I found very familiar.

349
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,890
So he says upon the king,

350
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,640
let us our lives,
our souls,

351
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,160
our debts are careful wives,

352
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,880
our children and our sins lay on the king.

353
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:29,370
We must bear all.

354
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:35,650
So he knows that the king is
responsible for everything.

355
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,480
Got To take ownership of everything.

356
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,673
Hmm.

357
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,381
And he,

358
00:26:41,381 --> 00:26:46,381
he kind of talks about
this idea that the king is,

359
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,950
it's, you know, it's, it's the
expression of it's lonely at the top.

360
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,310
He's about to get into
that in whatever it was,

361
00:26:56,311 --> 00:27:00,180
1599 oh ceremony show me.

362
00:27:00,181 --> 00:27:04,650
But I worth, what is the
soul of adoration? Art,

363
00:27:04,651 --> 00:27:08,850
thou ought else but place, degree
and form. So he's saying like,

364
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:13,140
what is all this junk besides
just social rank and etiquette?

365
00:27:13,141 --> 00:27:18,141
What real meaning does it have creating
all in fear in other men wearing in vow

366
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,560
art, less happy being
feared than they inferior.

367
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,210
So he's saying,
look like these people are scared of me.

368
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,550
[inaudible] I'm actually less happy than
they are. They're, they're afraid of me,

369
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:34,650
but I'm less happy because I'm
the guy that's scaring them.

370
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:43,410
I am a king that find the,
and I know tis not the bomb,

371
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:48,480
the sector and the ball, the sword
that may face the crown imperial,

372
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:53,190
the Inter tissued robe of Golden Pearl,
the Farsad title,

373
00:27:53,191 --> 00:27:54,690
running for the king,

374
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:00,680
the throne he sits on nor the tide of
pump that beats upon the high shore of

375
00:28:01,111 --> 00:28:01,770
this world.

376
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:06,000
So he go through all of the kind of
stereotypical things that make you a king,

377
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,230
you know the clothes, the Septor,
the crown, all those things.

378
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:16,410
No,
not all these thrice gorgeous ceremony.

379
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,310
Not all these laid in bed majestical

380
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:24,210
so not any of those beautiful things.

381
00:28:24,211 --> 00:28:29,211
Expensive things can sleep so
soundly as the wretched slave.

382
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:37,010
So it's the slave who with a body
filled and vacant mind gets him to rest,

383
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:43,650
crammed with distressful bread.

384
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:49,050
So he's talking about
this fact that the king

385
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:53,550
doesn't get to rest. He doesn't get to
sleep when the slave goes home at night.

386
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,340
Yeah, he's gonna eat the Fed
with and distressful basically.

387
00:28:56,341 --> 00:28:58,440
That means that they made it themselves.
They made with their own hands,

388
00:28:58,441 --> 00:29:02,370
they actually get some satisfaction
of making their food and eating it.

389
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:04,440
He didn't even get that satisfaction.

390
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:08,430
His mind is constantly churning
about the fate of the kingdom.

391
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,850
And you know this actually,
interestingly, when I was in a,

392
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:16,910
I know we did a podcast here about Sri
Lanka and I talked about me being in Sri

393
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:20,130
Lanka and I, I tried to drag is because
again, I'd never been in combat.

394
00:29:20,131 --> 00:29:21,430
This is the mid ninety's.

395
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:26,670
And I tried to drag as much knowledge
as I could out of the Sri Lankan guys,

396
00:29:26,671 --> 00:29:30,480
the Shawangunk and military in this
trunk and Special Boat Service in this

397
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:34,600
special forces guys that we were working
with. And they were unbelievably, uh,

398
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,720
combat experienced veterans.

399
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:42,380
But one of the guys that I befriended
who is an army captain and you know his,

400
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:48,640
he, he was one of those guys who's a
guy that was a good leader. But man,

401
00:29:48,641 --> 00:29:52,660
he felt exactly what this got what, what
Henry the fifth is talking about here.

402
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:54,940
And I remember him saying,
you know,

403
00:29:54,941 --> 00:29:57,880
he's kind of just having a late night
conversation with me. Cause like I said,

404
00:29:57,881 --> 00:30:02,881
I was constantly trying to garner
information from these guys and learn from

405
00:30:03,041 --> 00:30:06,580
them. And you know, he gets
this guy had been at, this guy,

406
00:30:06,581 --> 00:30:09,400
had been a regular soldier
and then he had been promoted.

407
00:30:09,401 --> 00:30:12,580
He'd gone up the ranks and
he said, you know, Jocko,

408
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:18,610
when I was a soldier, meaning when he
was just a grunt soldier and you know,

409
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,310
lower enlisted guy,
he said,

410
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,840
I knew I could survive anything and
I knew I could take care of myself.

411
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:30,730
And it was actually kind of fun.
And he said,

412
00:30:30,731 --> 00:30:34,990
now that Omar Company commander, cause
now we use actually a pretty senior guy.

413
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:36,940
He said,

414
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:41,940
it is the most stress in it is the most
harrowing thing because I am not worried

415
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:46,150
about myself anymore, but I'm so
worried about all these other guys.

416
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:50,980
That's what the worry is. And Yeah, I uh,

417
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,650
I actually got to know
that feeling myself. Hmm.

418
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,290
The leader gets no rest in the end.

419
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:02,020
And what Henry's talking about
is that burden of command.

420
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,330
That's the same thing that Sri
Lankan guy was talking about.

421
00:31:04,331 --> 00:31:06,820
And you hear me talking about it as well.
You know,

422
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:10,030
that burden of command is heavy.

423
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,980
And now, so now, you know, again,

424
00:31:14,981 --> 00:31:19,981
I've kind of gone very
quickly through what this,

425
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:26,200
to get to this point where we're Henry
the fifth makes this famous speech.

426
00:31:26,201 --> 00:31:26,741
And as I said,

427
00:31:26,741 --> 00:31:29,290
the English on one side of the battlefield
in the French or the other. Again,

428
00:31:29,291 --> 00:31:30,400
this really happened,
this is,

429
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:36,240
this is factual information and they
can hear each other and they can not at

430
00:31:36,431 --> 00:31:39,430
night they see each other's campfires
burning in any English. Like I said,

431
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:43,840
they know they're outnumbered. And
finally one of the leaders, you know,

432
00:31:43,841 --> 00:31:46,120
as they're, as they're getting
ready to go into combat,

433
00:31:46,121 --> 00:31:47,740
one of the leaders from the British side,

434
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,700
he calls out kind of like
wishing that they had more men.

435
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:57,130
And it's interesting and it's
pretty important to know that,

436
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:01,540
I mean, obviously Shakespeare
fictionalized this in many ways,

437
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:04,990
but that speech is actually
rooted in a real account.

438
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:11,710
It's rooted in a real account
of something that was said.

439
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:12,590
And,
and,

440
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:17,300
and the account was written
by an anonymous chaplain
that was like on tour with

441
00:32:17,301 --> 00:32:19,760
these guys.
And he just wrote down what he saw.

442
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,830
And in his report it was the,
uh,

443
00:32:22,831 --> 00:32:27,831
a guy named Sir Walter Hungerford that
suggested to the king that it would be

444
00:32:28,431 --> 00:32:31,760
nice if they had another 10,000 orchards
from England that we're not doing

445
00:32:31,761 --> 00:32:34,670
anything, you know, that are sitting
back doing, you know, back in England,

446
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:39,200
sitting in peace. And it'd be nice if
they had in there. And now in the play,

447
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,710
it's a character named Westmoreland,
who's one of, you know, this, the,

448
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:46,100
the lieutenants or the, one of the, uh,

449
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:51,080
subordinate leadership of Henry
the fifth. And he says, oh,

450
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,880
that we now had here,

451
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:58,060
but one 10,000 of those men in
England that do no work today.

452
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,800
So he's saying that same
thing. He's like, listen,

453
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:05,030
here we are about to go to battle.
We're completely outnumbered

454
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,573
and

455
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,700
be nice if we had some of those other
guys that are in England right now that

456
00:33:11,701 --> 00:33:15,930
are sitting in bed, they're
doing nothing. And so,

457
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:19,140
so now King Henry Responds and,
and again this is,

458
00:33:19,141 --> 00:33:23,720
this is in the same vein that was
documented by this anonymous chaplain.

459
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,290
And of course Shakespeare wrote it. So
it's gotta be, it's a lot more impactful,

460
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:29,790
but the message is the same.

461
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:33,900
And I'm going to go through this
once and kind of break it down. So,

462
00:33:33,901 --> 00:33:38,901
so that we can understand what the meaning
of these different words are before I

463
00:33:39,391 --> 00:33:44,250
just roll through it.
So when he see her,

464
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:48,690
this guy says, you know, if only we
had more guys and King Henry says,

465
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:54,330
what's he that wishes?
So meaning who just set that said,

466
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,410
my cousin Westmoreland.
No, my fair cousin,

467
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:01,380
if we are marked to die,

468
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:06,390
we are enough to do our
country loss and if to live,

469
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:09,720
the fewer men,
the greater share of honor.

470
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:14,020
So he's saying, no, listen,
if we're going to die,

471
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:16,690
we've got plenty of guys
here to die for our country.

472
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:21,790
But if we're going to live and if we're
going to win, the fewer men we have,

473
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:25,270
the better because
that's more honor for us.

474
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:26,203
Hmm.

475
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:32,200
God's will.
I pray thee wish not one more man.

476
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,480
He doesn't want anybody else by jove.

477
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:41,660
I am not covetous for gold nor
care I who doth feed upon my cost.

478
00:34:42,451 --> 00:34:46,110
So he doesn't care about gold.
He doesn't care who he feeds and who,

479
00:34:46,111 --> 00:34:48,960
who eats off of his
check that he is cashing.

480
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:53,010
It earns me not if my men,

481
00:34:53,011 --> 00:34:55,500
my garments wear meaning isn't people.

482
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,740
He didn't care if people are either taking
his clothes or if they're wearing his

483
00:34:58,741 --> 00:35:01,200
world colors. It doesn't care.
Doesn't care about any of that.

484
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,910
Such outward things
dwell not in my desires.

485
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,830
Those things don't matter to him.

486
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:12,000
But if it,

487
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:14,700
if it be a sin to covet honor,

488
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,140
I am the most offending soul alive.

489
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:26,840
So if it's about honor and if it's
a sin to want honor and want glory,

490
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,370
that he's the guiltiest person of a mall.

491
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:34,470
No faith my Coz wish,
not a man from England,

492
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,180
God's peace.

493
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:41,210
I would not so great an honor as a one
more man me thinks would share from me

494
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:47,350
for the best hope I have.
Oh, do not waste one more.

495
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:50,350
So he's just going off like,
no, we don't want anyone else.

496
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:53,320
I don't want to share my
honor with anyone else.

497
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:00,480
Rather proclaim it Westmoreland
through my host that he,

498
00:36:00,941 --> 00:36:03,490
which hath no stomach to this fight.

499
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:08,550
Let him depart his passport shall be
made and crowns for convoy put into his

500
00:36:09,341 --> 00:36:14,040
purse. So is it okay? You
know what, Westmoreland,

501
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,300
as a matter of fact,

502
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:21,710
tell everyone that anybody that doesn't
have the guts or the stomach to stand

503
00:36:22,831 --> 00:36:25,260
here with us and fight,

504
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:32,350
tell him I'll give him a passport and
I'll give them money to pay for their trip

505
00:36:32,351 --> 00:36:33,184
home.

506
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:39,760
We would not die in that man's company
that fears his fellowship to die with us.

507
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:46,830
He doesn't want to die with
anybody that fears that duty.

508
00:36:46,831 --> 00:36:50,070
That's what they mean by fellowship.
The duty to die with us

509
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:57,190
this day is called the
feast of Crispian Crispian.

510
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:03,140
This is actually alleged twin brothers.
Interestingly,

511
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,900
Crispin Crispian twin brothers,

512
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:11,200
they help the poor and they preach
Christianity and they were tortured by the

513
00:37:12,221 --> 00:37:16,820
Roman governor and they were thrown
into the river with millstones,

514
00:37:16,821 --> 00:37:21,470
tied around their necks and they
survived and when they survive that,

515
00:37:21,471 --> 00:37:23,600
they pulled him out of the
water and they beheaded them.

516
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:25,323
Okay?

517
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,120
They were venerated and they became
saints on October 25th and that's called

518
00:37:30,121 --> 00:37:32,820
Saint Crispin's Day.
Sometimes it's called sync crispy ins day,

519
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:37,080
but that's what it is.
So this day,

520
00:37:37,081 --> 00:37:40,830
this is October 25th when
they're about to fight, he says,

521
00:37:40,831 --> 00:37:42,990
this day is called the feast of Crispian.

522
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,950
He that outlives this
day and comes home safe.

523
00:37:46,951 --> 00:37:51,951
We'll stand a tiptoe when the day is
named and rouse him at the name of

524
00:37:52,081 --> 00:37:52,914
Crispian.

525
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:57,210
Is there anybody that anybody that lives
through this day and comes home safe

526
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,360
when it's going to be Saint Crispin's Day,
they're going to get on their toes.

527
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,400
They're going to be so excited about it.

528
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,270
He that she'll see this
day and live old age,

529
00:38:08,271 --> 00:38:11,930
will yearly on the vigil feast,
his neighbors and say,

530
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,410
tomorrow is Saint Crispian.
So again,

531
00:38:15,411 --> 00:38:18,500
anybody that lives through this is going
to be going to their neighbors and say,

532
00:38:18,501 --> 00:38:19,760
hey,
tomorrow Saint Crispin's Day,

533
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,303
then

534
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:29,830
will he strip his sleeve and show his
scars and say these wounds I had on

535
00:38:30,651 --> 00:38:34,730
Crispin's Day,
so he's gonna be at their feet.

536
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:37,660
He's going to roll up his sleeves and
he's going to say, you see these scars?

537
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:42,840
These are what I got on Crispin's Day
old men forget yet all shall be forgot.

538
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:51,940
But he'll remember with advantages
what feats he did that day.

539
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,850
So he's saying everything gets forgotten,
right?

540
00:38:54,851 --> 00:38:59,851
But the old man will remember the glory
days of that battle and what he did,

541
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,340
it will be the highlight of his life.

542
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:11,680
Then our names familiar in
his mouth as household words.

543
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:16,420
Harry, the King Bedford and
Exeter, Warwick and Talbot,

544
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:20,620
Salisbury and Gloucester
be in their flowing cups,

545
00:39:20,621 --> 00:39:22,060
freshly remembered.

546
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:27,100
So all their names are
going to be remembered.

547
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:34,820
This story shall the good man teach his
son and Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go

548
00:39:35,761 --> 00:39:38,910
by from this day to the
ending of the world.

549
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:44,460
But we in it shall be
remembered. We say, look,

550
00:39:44,461 --> 00:39:49,461
this is a story that good men are going
to tell their sons and their gonna

551
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:54,870
forever. Remember on this day
till the ending of the world,

552
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:00,110
what we did,
we few,

553
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:01,340
we happy few.

554
00:40:01,341 --> 00:40:06,341
We band of brothers for he today that
sheds his blood with me shall be my

555
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:07,604
brother.

556
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:12,050
And that one doesn't
really need an explanation,

557
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,630
but we just shared.
You hear about Brotherhood a lot.

558
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,733
Yeah.

559
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:27,030
Be He ne'er so vile this day
shall gentle his condition.

560
00:40:27,161 --> 00:40:30,790
So no matter where you're from,
no matter what you were like,

561
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:34,210
no matter what kind of
a person you were today,

562
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:38,770
when he says gentle his condition that
today we'll make you a gentleman today

563
00:40:38,771 --> 00:40:40,180
we'll make you a man

564
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,920
and gentlemen in England.
Now we're bed.

565
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:50,270
So guys that are back in England right
now sleeping shall think themselves or

566
00:40:50,271 --> 00:40:51,104
curse it.

567
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:56,500
They were not here and hold their manhoods
cheap whilst any speaks that fought

568
00:40:59,421 --> 00:41:03,830
with us upon Saint Crispin's Day.
So like I said,

569
00:41:03,831 --> 00:41:06,890
anyone that's home in
England and that word a bed,

570
00:41:06,891 --> 00:41:09,410
it's like implies being lazy and sleeping.

571
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:14,090
They're going to curse that they
weren't there and they'll know that they

572
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:17,900
weren't real men. And Emma,
he used the word manhood,

573
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,570
which implies,
you know,

574
00:41:20,571 --> 00:41:25,571
testicular fortitude [inaudible] they
didn't have the testicular fortitude to

575
00:41:26,391 --> 00:41:27,224
fight.

576
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,100
And that's,
that's

577
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:39,080
the speech with the understanding.
And I haven't even gone all the way.

578
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:39,561
I mean,

579
00:41:39,561 --> 00:41:44,561
I didn't go to break down each and every
word and the depth and meaning behind

580
00:41:45,261 --> 00:41:48,470
them because they are so impactful.

581
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:57,870
And if you go and you read, you can
get like a translated modern version,

582
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,800
um, that kind of dumbs down
the language and that's okay.

583
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:06,670
But I'm telling you, having
done both, when you do that,

584
00:42:06,671 --> 00:42:11,671
that's like compared to actually doing
the work and studying and figuring out

585
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:16,720
what it all actually means.
If you just take a dumbed down version,

586
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:21,670
it's like Diet Shakespeare
or Shakespeare, right? It's,

587
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:23,350
it's actually worse than that.
It's like that.

588
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:27,400
It's like firing a cap gun
versus firing a real gun.

589
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:31,150
It kind of looks the same. And it
might even sound a little bit the same,

590
00:42:31,151 --> 00:42:34,960
but one of them will kill you. Yeah. And
the other one just goes bang. You know,

591
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:39,970
it's not as heavy. And what's
really bizarre, and this is,

592
00:42:39,971 --> 00:42:44,620
I think actually this is really strange.

593
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:49,630
If you go on Youtube
and you look up

594
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:55,330
Henry the fifth St Crispin's Day
speech, right? If you look it up,

595
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:00,720
you'll get these classically
trained actors famous.

596
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:06,670
I mean,
famous actors doing this speech

597
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:10,540
and in my mind,
yeah.

598
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:11,443
Okay.

599
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:18,600
They don't get it. They don't get
it. Right. And I bet you know what,

600
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:19,770
I know I'm a nobody.

601
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:24,000
I know I'm just some guy in these people
are people that studied Shakespeare and

602
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:28,680
did it on stage and all of a sudden
I'm just an ignorant, uh, you know,

603
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:33,740
Rach from the trenches and I don't
understand I am the pentameter and all the

604
00:43:34,171 --> 00:43:37,770
other little details,
but I'm telling you,

605
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,050
I don't think they get it.

606
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:43,860
And when I watch the
professionals do this,

607
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:48,690
I don't think they get the
emotion. I don't think they
understand the leadership.

608
00:43:48,691 --> 00:43:52,680
I don't think they get the fear
and the blood and the death.

609
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,160
And I don't think they understand war.

610
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,630
And when these actors

611
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:09,600
take these great words
better crafted brilliantly,

612
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:14,590
and they try and say
them like leaders to me,

613
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,040
they still sound like actors.

614
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:21,830
They don't sound like
men that have fought.

615
00:44:21,831 --> 00:44:24,440
They don't sound like
men that had seen battle.

616
00:44:24,441 --> 00:44:27,100
They definitely don't sound
like men that have seen war.

617
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,840
I think Henry,
the fifth would have sounded different.

618
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:38,700
This is what

619
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:45,350
I think would be closer to what Henry
the fifth a combat leader would have

620
00:44:48,211 --> 00:44:50,820
sounded like as he,

621
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:56,520
as he answered some one of his subordinate
leaders out there in the crowd saying

622
00:44:56,521 --> 00:44:58,890
that we need more people.
We need more men.

623
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:02,490
I think this is what he
would have sounded like.

624
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:09,900
What's he that wishes? So
my cousin Westmoreland,

625
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:16,320
no, my fair cousin, if
we are marked to die,

626
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:21,530
we are enough to do our country
loss and if to live the fewer men,

627
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:26,520
the greater share of honor,
God's will.

628
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:29,430
I pray thee wish.
Not One more man

629
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:32,820
by jove.

630
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:37,820
I am not covetous for gold nor
care I who doth feed upon my cost.

631
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,870
It earns me not if men,

632
00:45:39,871 --> 00:45:44,871
my garments wear such outward
things dwell not in my desires,

633
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:51,030
but if it be a sin to covet honor,

634
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:56,460
I am the most offending soul alive.

635
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:01,470
No faith, my Coz wish,
not a man from England.

636
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:02,880
God's peace.

637
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:09,230
I would not lose so great an honor as one
man more me thinks would share from me

638
00:46:09,361 --> 00:46:12,090
for the best hope I have.

639
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:15,300
O do not wish one more.

640
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:22,160
Rather proclaim it Westmoreland through
my host that he which hath no stomach to

641
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,170
this fight.

642
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:30,170
Let him depart his passport shall be
made and crowns for convoy shall be put

643
00:46:31,141 --> 00:46:32,370
into his purse.

644
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:39,320
We would not die in that man's company
that fears his fellowship to die with us.

645
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:47,460
This Day is called the feast of Crispian.

646
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:51,870
He that outlives this
day and comes home safe.

647
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:56,930
We'll stand a tiptoe when the day is
named and rouse him at the name of

648
00:46:57,391 --> 00:46:58,224
Crispian.

649
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:04,910
He that shall see this day and live old
age will yearly on the vigil feast his

650
00:47:05,941 --> 00:47:08,790
neighbors and say,
tomorrow is Saint Crispian.

651
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:16,010
Then will he strip his sleeve and show
his scars and say these wounds I had on

652
00:47:18,191 --> 00:47:19,440
Crispin's Day

653
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:27,450
old men forget
yet all shall be forgot,

654
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:32,930
but he'll remember with advantages
what feats he did that day.

655
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:41,540
Then shall our names familiar
in his mouth as household words.

656
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:46,140
Harry, the King Bedford and
Exeter, Warwick and Talbot,

657
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:50,280
Salisbury and Gloucester
be in their flowing cups,

658
00:47:50,281 --> 00:47:51,630
freshly remembered

659
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:59,050
this story shall the
good man teach his son

660
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:06,300
and Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by
from this day to the ending of the world.

661
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:12,250
But we in it shall be.
Remember it, we few,

662
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,450
we happy few.
We band of brothers

663
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:23,510
for cook for he today that sheds his
blood with me shall be my brother.

664
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:30,750
Be Ne'er so vile this day
shall gentle his condition

665
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:37,810
and gentlemen in England now a bed
shall think themselves or curse it.

666
00:48:37,811 --> 00:48:42,811
They were not here and hold their manhoods
cheap was any speaks that fought with

667
00:48:43,721 --> 00:48:47,860
us
upon Saint Crispin's Day.

668
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:59,240
Now that is a speech
and that is,

669
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:01,161
like I said,

670
00:49:01,161 --> 00:49:06,161
there's a lot more to
it then what I covered,

671
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:11,560
there's so much depth there and that's
why it's lasted the ages and that's why

672
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:17,030
you hear people talking about brotherhood
and this is what they refer to.

673
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:23,450
And as far as Shakespeare goes,

674
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:28,510
and I talk all the time about getting
stronger and faster and getting smarter

675
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:34,420
and stronger and faster.

676
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,930
That's okay.

677
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:40,740
I mean that's pretty straightforward.
How do you get stronger and faster?

678
00:49:40,741 --> 00:49:43,320
You lose weight, you workout,
you do your calisthenics,

679
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:47,460
you do physical activity
to get stronger and faster.

680
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:51,870
But how do you get smarter?
Well,

681
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,850
this is one way to get smarter.

682
00:49:55,530 --> 00:50:00,270
You go out and you find something that
you do not understand and you gain

683
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,560
understanding of it.

684
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:07,950
Words you don't know and phrases you
don't know and concepts that you don't

685
00:50:07,951 --> 00:50:12,300
know. You find them and you
learn them. You teach yourself.

686
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:14,160
The resources are there,

687
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:23,190
and by the way, you know what? It's free.

688
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:27,000
There's no gym fees,
there's no equipment to,

689
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:30,740
you can get all of Shakespeare,

690
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:33,740
his entire cannon on
the Internet for free.

691
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,230
It's at the library for free.

692
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:42,520
The only thing it does take in,

693
00:50:42,521 --> 00:50:46,330
the only thing it does cost is just a
little something that we call discipline,

694
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:50,470
right? To get in there, to open
that book, to challenge your brain

695
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,070
in order to free your mind.

696
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:04,310
So that's Shakespeare.
That's Henry the fifth and

697
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:06,950
very impactful

698
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:13,750
and definitely a classic representation
of the band of brothers that I had the

699
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:19,190
honor to work with

700
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:25,320
in Ramadi,
Iraq in 2006 the first of the five oh six.

701
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:33,240
And I guess it is time for
questions from the Inter webs

702
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:40,060
and uh,
speaking of the interwebs,

703
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,350
little something from Ana. Yes. Yeah.

704
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:48,460
We are in fact sponsored by
[inaudible] dot com boom.

705
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:54,370
Which is where Jack, we'll get to this
krill oil to keep, we'll say what?

706
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,500
Aging joints.
No,

707
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:59,440
we'll just say joints
did not deteriorating.

708
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:03,880
We'll just say aging joints to
keep his joints together. Um,

709
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:07,600
sorry.
I get some Alpha brain.

710
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:10,750
That's why I'm so smart
and my memory's so good.

711
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:13,920
I'm actually encouraging you
to take more Alpha brain. Yeah,

712
00:52:13,921 --> 00:52:18,640
it's up the game a little bit.
What? It's good. Um, yeah.

713
00:52:18,641 --> 00:52:23,270
So on it.com and get some
and you can get some, uh,

714
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:26,920
get some kettle bells and some club
bells and go and toss those things around

715
00:52:26,921 --> 00:52:30,450
and get yourself a little bit stronger.
Get them in on it. That myself. I've,

716
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:34,270
I have a few Zombie bells at the house
and you probably used Allen. I have them.

717
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,310
I have them.
They're my,

718
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:41,230
they're my kind of go to when I have them
sitting around because they, they do.

719
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:44,320
They kind of draw you in because I see,
what do I think when I see Zombie,

720
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:47,680
when I see zombies,
I think Zombie apocalypse.

721
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:49,740
I think I've been rewriting
something like, oh,

722
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:53,350
it hit a couple of kettlebell snatches
real quick while I got a little the

723
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:57,550
little two minutes spare.
Boom. Hold up there.

724
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:01,960
And they're dope though. And apparently
they're balanced just like regular ones.

725
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:03,730
Yeah. No, they feel they feel not all it.

726
00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:09,770
You know when you can get them@onit.com
o n n I t.com/jocko and you get 10% off.

727
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:12,243
Boom.

728
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:16,480
Get some shroom tech sport
while you're the shroom texts.

729
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,480
I think lever as a public service.
Yeah.

730
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:23,590
If you're doing something that's high
output, like a crossfit situations,

731
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:28,890
that's a public telling you night
and day anyway. Shroom tech sport.

732
00:53:28,891 --> 00:53:31,920
That's the one I'm going to
go on the shirt to explore
it, I think. I don't think.

733
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:33,120
See what's up.
Thank you.

734
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:37,080
Shit it then what about
the amazon.com yes.

735
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:42,140
If you would like to support
this podcast in a painless way,

736
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:47,100
we'd call it painless, seamless,
seamless, and painless squads. I seamless,

737
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,890
instead of going straight to amazon.com
go to Jocko store.com or Jocko podcast,

738
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:55,170
buy a TV flat screen,

739
00:53:55,290 --> 00:53:59,580
plasma TV for $800. Right,
and you could do it through,

740
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:02,520
you do it through,
you click through Jocko,

741
00:54:02,521 --> 00:54:06,930
podcast.com or Jocko store.com.
Sure. Then in the podcast,

742
00:54:06,931 --> 00:54:11,790
get supported financially. Yeah. I get to
like, you know a little little Samsung.

743
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:15,220
That's cool. It's better than
nothing. Yeah, and it's, yeah,

744
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:18,540
an actually Amazon pages
because, because, yeah.

745
00:54:18,541 --> 00:54:23,460
That's cool because it takes time to do
the podcast, right? It takes preparation.

746
00:54:23,461 --> 00:54:27,600
Do the podcast. Yeah, and you
know what? I'm going to be
honest, bro. I do it anyway.

747
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:31,650
Obviously I think you would do, but we did
it, but people ask though, they're like,

748
00:54:31,651 --> 00:54:34,100
hey, this is great. Let's to people,
they'll, they'll sign up somebody,

749
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:34,921
I guess other podcasts,

750
00:54:34,921 --> 00:54:37,470
they'll have situations where you can
sign up and just enter your credit card

751
00:54:37,471 --> 00:54:41,100
and it'll take out like a dollar a month
or something as like a thing. This guy,

752
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:44,820
um, I for totally forget his
name, such a cool way. Anyway,

753
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:46,800
emailed me and told me that I
was like, Dang, that's solid.

754
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:51,690
But nonetheless we do that.
It's necessary,

755
00:54:52,110 --> 00:54:53,980
but I dunno,
I think we're just,

756
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:57,570
maybe we'll research that because I
deal with people would always say, hey,

757
00:54:57,571 --> 00:54:58,404
how can we support?

758
00:54:58,430 --> 00:55:03,030
Because people are getting value and when
they get value they want to give value.

759
00:55:03,031 --> 00:55:05,490
They want to give you something back,
which is awesome. Yeah. I appreciate that.

760
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:09,180
Yeah. Very cool. Very cool. Yeah.
I mean the prep notes today,

761
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:13,370
we're 17 pages long working on
for the past few days. Yeah.

762
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:16,890
Getting Ready. You know, that's
like a term paper in college,

763
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:20,660
you know those grinders total gut check.
Yeah.

764
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:25,770
It's like a 400 level term paper.
My term papers or one page. Yeah,

765
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:29,520
one paid college athlete
over there and uh, oh yeah.

766
00:55:29,521 --> 00:55:33,390
One more thing about about
Amazon. Somebody hit me up
on Twitter and said, hey,

767
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:36,450
you need to say on your
podcast that you have your,

768
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:41,370
your book extreme ownership is
an audio book. Yeah. And what,

769
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:45,900
what I think is cool about it is
leaf who wrote the book with me?

770
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,760
He's another seal.

771
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:52,820
He worked with me in Ramadi and he
and I are the ones that read it.

772
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:57,780
So we each wrote chapters. We wrote
half the chapters and we reread it.

773
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:00,690
So you know if you're used to
the Jocko podcast voice. Yeah.

774
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:02,910
And annual life was on the podcast,

775
00:56:02,911 --> 00:56:06,360
obviously podcast number 11 so we get,

776
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:10,110
you can get the audio book and you
got another, it's eight hours long.

777
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:13,500
It's no joke. If you got a long
drive, eight hour drive. Yeah.

778
00:56:13,501 --> 00:56:16,050
Get she got an eight hour drive.
Francisco from San Diego. Yeah. Yeah.

779
00:56:16,051 --> 00:56:20,700
That's one of those drives. It's good.
Okay. Yeah. So Dzongkha store.com

780
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:24,070
Jocko,

781
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:28,840
podcast.com all right. In
on it. Oh in in it.com.

782
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:33,130
Thanks. [inaudible] Bronco. Thank
you. Alright, Internet questions.

783
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:38,140
First question,
kind of a paragraph with a question.

784
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:41,200
You ever got some long questions Jocko.

785
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:45,730
I'm just curious about your opinions
on the regular army infantry.

786
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:50,440
It seems like nowadays the
regular infantry is almost
looked down upon from the

787
00:56:50,441 --> 00:56:54,790
regular public in every prior
military public speaker.

788
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:59,530
I almost feel like we're looked at like
we were just bodies that held ground and

789
00:56:59,531 --> 00:57:02,830
absorbed attacks.
It may no real impact on the war.

790
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:08,500
I'm almost hesitant to ask because I'm
not sure if I can or I'm not sure if I'm

791
00:57:08,501 --> 00:57:10,840
in denial or if it's just pride.

792
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:15,010
I served with some fantastic warriors and
I don't want those heroes to be looked

793
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,130
over in history because
they were regular grunts.

794
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,550
So I enjoy your opinions on this matter.

795
00:57:21,551 --> 00:57:26,380
And if you could enlighten
me on how infantry divisions
are looked at from other

796
00:57:26,381 --> 00:57:27,730
groups and organizations.

797
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:33,340
Yeah. Um, the, I'm

798
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:39,530
this question, you
know, it, it bothers me.

799
00:57:40,550 --> 00:57:44,750
It bothers me because if you couldn't
tell from the opening that I did tonight

800
00:57:44,751 --> 00:57:48,530
talking about the first of five oh six
I would tell you the same thing about so

801
00:57:48,531 --> 00:57:53,531
many other units that we have the utmost
respect and admiration for what we used

802
00:57:56,211 --> 00:57:59,450
to call conventional for forces with
an alcohol general purpose forces.

803
00:57:59,451 --> 00:58:03,960
But it's the marine corps, the the
US Marine Corps, the U S Army there,

804
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:09,000
they're regular infantry to ground
pattern there grunts and we,

805
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:14,240
like I said, the guys in my task and
at the guys that own the seal teams,

806
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:19,330
we have nothing but respect and
admiration for the ground pounders for the

807
00:58:20,601 --> 00:58:23,450
grunts and for my position,
you know,

808
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:26,360
haven't been in Ramadi with the two
to eight which was a reserve unit for

809
00:58:26,361 --> 00:58:31,250
Pennsylvania, that iron soldiers, those
guys were outstanding, outstanding.

810
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:35,060
And then they turned over with the 180
and you've heard me talk about them and

811
00:58:35,061 --> 00:58:39,690
the battalions that were attached to them,
those guys were just the,

812
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:44,510
all of them. I mean, they were
just so professional, so brave.

813
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:49,660
And of course special forces and seals
and Rangers in Marsoc and af soc for

814
00:58:49,731 --> 00:58:50,660
whatever reason.

815
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:52,333
Okay.

816
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:57,060
Special operations gets attention, right?
I mean, the name is special operations,

817
00:58:57,061 --> 00:58:58,110
so it gets this attention.

818
00:58:58,111 --> 00:59:03,111
I'm not 100% sure where it comes
from or where it started or whatever,

819
00:59:03,301 --> 00:59:07,080
but there's something about that
that the public and the media,

820
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:08,313
okay.

821
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:11,320
And I don't know,
the media feeds the public in the foot.

822
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:15,860
The public feeds the media and
the media feeds the public.

823
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:18,230
So like the public wants to see stories.

824
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:23,030
So the media produces stories about the
special operations and then it goes into

825
00:59:23,031 --> 00:59:24,890
a vicious circle,
a vicious circle,

826
00:59:24,891 --> 00:59:28,010
and they just make a bunch of new
stories about it. And so, you know,

827
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:33,070
it's like this little mystique or
whatever of special operations probably

828
00:59:34,011 --> 00:59:37,010
that's, that's, that's having that impact.

829
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,820
But let me tell you, or just for
everybody, for anyone that's on,

830
00:59:40,821 --> 00:59:44,120
that's not been in the military
that has that, you know, things. Oh,

831
00:59:44,121 --> 00:59:46,820
the special operations guys must be more,
you know,

832
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:51,140
elite or do more dangerous
stuff. Wrong, wrong.

833
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:56,450
Do they do dangerous stuff? Yes.
But you know, I've been all in,

834
00:59:56,451 --> 01:00:00,610
when I was in Iraq, my first deployment
to Iraq, when all over Iraq is SPEC,

835
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:02,360
second deployment stayed in Ramadi.

836
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:06,890
But I during that time saw
the conventional units,

837
01:00:06,891 --> 01:00:10,250
the general purpose forces that ground
pounders are grunts, the Marine Corps.

838
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:15,560
And not just them, but I talked about
this last time, the, the logistics folks,

839
01:00:15,561 --> 01:00:16,790
I mean, so it's everybody,
they're out there,

840
01:00:16,791 --> 01:00:18,920
they're living in forward operating basis.

841
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:22,190
They're living in combat outposts
in the middle of cities, you know,

842
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:27,220
small groups out there eating Mras
just living in really tough conditions,

843
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:30,980
doing daytime patrols and horrible areas,

844
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:34,070
working with Iraqi soldiers. Uh, you know,

845
01:00:34,071 --> 01:00:36,410
like I just said to doing
these logistics runs, you know,

846
01:00:36,411 --> 01:00:39,830
these where you get blown up with an Iud,
these are where you get ambushed.

847
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:43,220
I mean, this is what they did all the
time. Everyday. This was their job.

848
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:46,100
Even like the mind clearance operations,
you know,

849
01:00:46,101 --> 01:00:50,480
mind you going out and you're going out
to go and get blown up or try and look

850
01:00:50,481 --> 01:00:53,030
for things that are going to blow
you up. And, and you know, you first,

851
01:00:53,031 --> 01:00:55,880
sure you got some guys that are in
the big mind protected vehicles.

852
01:00:55,881 --> 01:00:56,601
But when we were in Ramadi,

853
01:00:56,601 --> 01:00:58,700
there was a Marine Corp unit that
would follow behind those guys,

854
01:00:58,701 --> 01:01:00,050
sometimes in army or they
would fall behind this.

855
01:01:00,051 --> 01:01:03,980
There's sniper infantry guys just
out there getting after it. And so

856
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:10,490
what do we think of that?
I mean I have just admiration,

857
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:14,390
respect and just utmost the utmost.

858
01:01:14,391 --> 01:01:18,500
I hold those guys in the highest
esteem, um, because they held the line.

859
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:23,330
So to, to that guy, the out there
that asked that question, um,

860
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:24,613
believe me,

861
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:27,830
anybody that's been in combat and knows
what you guys do and I spread that word

862
01:01:27,831 --> 01:01:31,880
all the time. You listen to
any, even if you read, if you
read life, and I was book,

863
01:01:31,881 --> 01:01:36,590
I mean we talk about that in great detail
about the respect and admiration we

864
01:01:36,591 --> 01:01:41,480
had for, for the general purpose
forces, the grunts, the ground pounders,

865
01:01:41,481 --> 01:01:44,340
the bravest,
the most professional,

866
01:01:44,341 --> 01:01:48,260
the most dedicated people
that I could ever imagine.

867
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:54,220
And I was absolutely honored and everyone
in my seal task unit was honored and

868
01:01:55,671 --> 01:01:59,960
humbled to have served
with such brave warriors.

869
01:01:59,961 --> 01:02:04,730
So that's how I feel
about our US military.

870
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:10,023
Next question.

871
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:17,510
So Jocko posted a Twitter posts,
Instagram,

872
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:21,060
Tumblr,
Twitter and Instagram posts of a picture,

873
01:02:21,090 --> 01:02:25,740
black and white strangely and sort
of my gig. Yeah, you're thinking

874
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:31,140
of just the mats and I think there was
some ambiguous figures of, he was dean,

875
01:02:31,141 --> 01:02:32,400
right? Teaching somebody. Anyway,

876
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:38,060
he said talked about he learned the
lesson or something like that. Anyways,

877
01:02:38,061 --> 01:02:42,330
so the question is, Jocko, what lesson
did you learn for the thousandth time?

878
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:46,530
Cause he said, he said that it was
in training with dean the other day.

879
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:50,880
So what was that last lesson? Was rules
are rules must sometimes be broken.

880
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:54,030
So let me,
let me give you the quick story.

881
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:58,380
For those of you that are Jujitsu players
will indulge you a little bit with

882
01:02:58,381 --> 01:02:59,214
some Jujitsu.

883
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:04,310
So Friday night training and deny
usually train hard on Friday nights.

884
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:07,350
And we had, uh, we had a war,

885
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:12,360
we had a little death match on Friday and
it started off. We would have probably,

886
01:03:12,361 --> 01:03:16,310
I don't know, five, six,
maybe seven minutes. And he
got me, got me a little, uh,

887
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:19,770
got me in a little situation
that forced me to submit.

888
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:25,110
And then we, I was like, all right, let's
go again. And so we went again and I,

889
01:03:25,170 --> 01:03:27,930
and I warmed down and I
got the better of him.

890
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:32,460
And actually the deeper
water I take them into,

891
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:35,780
the better things get
for me. Right. And, uh,

892
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:41,360
so I warmed down and I got ahold
of his arm and I had him in a,

893
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:46,880
I had him in a compromised position
for probably five minutes and you know,

894
01:03:50,101 --> 01:03:53,850
he, and he added the last
moments, good to great timing.

895
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,800
And he just got out Armbar uh,
it was a straight arm locking.

896
01:03:59,490 --> 01:04:04,410
And uh, so he got out and we got out. He
was done. He was like, yeah, I'm done.

897
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:08,640
I mean, he got out of it, but he was
done. So Jocko got a little moral victory,

898
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:11,730
right. And then I kind of
antagonized him a little bit,

899
01:04:11,731 --> 01:04:15,180
which is what Dean and I do. We, we
instigate and we antagonize each other.

900
01:04:15,570 --> 01:04:18,160
And so I antagonized him a
little bit about, you know,

901
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:21,390
oh you don't want to train anymore. Oh
cause you're too, you're too broken down.

902
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:25,110
You know, I'm going to stay here and
train more. You can go home and you know,

903
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:29,400
have a glass of warm milk or water or you
know, just giving him a hard time. So,

904
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:34,590
so, you know, inside and
I failed to recognize this
inside. Psychologically he was,

905
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:39,600
he was not happy about that.
And so Saturday is like, Hey,

906
01:04:39,601 --> 01:04:43,860
you know, let's train. And so I, I
missed that. I missed that. It's a cute,

907
01:04:43,861 --> 01:04:48,240
that's a red flag. So when I showed
up, you know, he says, all, you know,

908
01:04:48,241 --> 01:04:49,320
let's just work some moves.

909
01:04:49,321 --> 01:04:53,850
And we went over some stuff and
work some other people and you know,

910
01:04:53,851 --> 01:04:56,040
we're just kind of were very relaxed,
laid back.

911
01:04:56,041 --> 01:05:00,330
There's no classical and we're just
just relaxing. And I said, hey man,

912
01:05:00,331 --> 01:05:03,750
I've got to leave at such and such a time.
I can go pick one of my kids up.

913
01:05:03,930 --> 01:05:05,820
He goes, yeah, yeah, no problem.
He goes, I got to leave too.

914
01:05:05,821 --> 01:05:07,110
So now I think he's got to leave.
Sorry.

915
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:09,840
I'm actually thinking we might get a
light roll and that'll be it. You know,

916
01:05:09,841 --> 01:05:14,730
maybe like two, five minute
rounds. So, and he's got the,

917
01:05:14,731 --> 01:05:17,290
you know, have a nice guy face and
all that stuff that he's given me.

918
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:22,720
So anyways, I said, all right, you know,
we worked on some stuff that he says,

919
01:05:22,721 --> 01:05:25,420
all right, let's roll real quick.
He even threw that out there.

920
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:27,820
Like it was just going to be a quick,
real quick. Yeah, just a quick role.

921
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:30,670
So I'm thinking, I'm thinking two
or three minute, I'm literally,

922
01:05:30,671 --> 01:05:33,580
I'm thinking two or three minutes he'd
like to go over maybe to try some of the

923
01:05:33,581 --> 01:05:37,570
stuff. We were just, we were
just drilling a little bit. No,

924
01:05:37,571 --> 01:05:42,130
he comes full on, I mean, any,
any, and it was disguised full on.

925
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:46,300
So he didn't, you know, get up.
But he just went very sternly and,

926
01:05:46,450 --> 01:05:50,770
and pass my guard really quick.
And then an actually,

927
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:53,640
you know,
you and I worked at,

928
01:05:53,710 --> 01:05:56,590
had discussed this mountain escape that
I had done to the other day and I was

929
01:05:56,591 --> 01:05:58,360
actually like on, I don't really
care if you're balanced right now.

930
01:05:58,361 --> 01:06:00,100
I've got this new escape
and I'll just use that.

931
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:05,880
And he aggressively mounted
and eve aggressively went
for this move that we call

932
01:06:06,341 --> 01:06:10,870
the snow angel, which is when
you get the person's arms up,

933
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:12,070
like a snow angel,

934
01:06:12,071 --> 01:06:16,540
like up above their head from the mouth
and it's just horror and pin there. Yeah.

935
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:20,020
And they're in their way above. You
have no leverage. You can't move.

936
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:23,310
And so not only to me in snowy,
it's you got me a double snowing.

937
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:25,930
So both my arms are stuck up there.

938
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:31,240
Now what was bad about this was there
was a moment, okay. And this was,

939
01:06:31,241 --> 01:06:33,730
this is the rule that I learned
because after we broke it down,

940
01:06:33,731 --> 01:06:36,070
so dean kept me there for,
you know,

941
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:40,630
probably seven minutes in,
in double snow angel,

942
01:06:40,631 --> 01:06:43,120
which is just a nightmare because
he's not just holding me there.

943
01:06:43,330 --> 01:06:45,040
He's like saying things and you know,

944
01:06:45,041 --> 01:06:50,041
he's antagonizing me and I'm sitting
there just wanting to kill him and uh,

945
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:52,870
I forget he,
I actually forget how it ended.

946
01:06:52,871 --> 01:06:56,050
I don't remember if he went for an arm
lock and he got it or if he went and I

947
01:06:56,051 --> 01:06:59,020
got out, I forget how it ended
because it's kind of a big blur,

948
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:02,740
which most of my rules are.
But anyways, the rule is,

949
01:07:02,741 --> 01:07:05,290
and I don't want to go into too much
detail, be could just cause it's,

950
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:08,500
it'll get too technical and too
hard to do through an audio podcast.

951
01:07:08,501 --> 01:07:09,620
But you know,

952
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:14,670
basically I don't let my elbow
cross the other person sternum.

953
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:17,470
I don't let it go across their
storm because if it does,

954
01:07:17,471 --> 01:07:19,420
you can get pinned there,
you can stuck there.

955
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:23,320
So there was a moment where when Dean
was trying to move me into snow angel,

956
01:07:23,530 --> 01:07:28,330
where I should have sacrificed and done
like a drastic movement that's a major

957
01:07:28,331 --> 01:07:31,570
breaking of that rule and turned to my
side really hard and put my elbow across

958
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:36,460
his sternum and it would've gotten me out.
And as we,

959
01:07:36,461 --> 01:07:39,220
as we looked at it, you
know, because once I was out,

960
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:42,010
then we went over it for a few minutes
just to just try and analyze what

961
01:07:42,011 --> 01:07:45,220
happened. And I realized that, you know,

962
01:07:45,221 --> 01:07:48,130
that I had held on to this rule of mine,

963
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:52,630
even though part of me was like, you
know, what should I try it? And I didn't,

964
01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:53,411
I didn't try it.

965
01:07:53,411 --> 01:07:55,870
And so then I got a worse position
or worse position or worse position.

966
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:59,230
So the lesson learned is that sometimes
you've got to break your rules.

967
01:07:59,231 --> 01:08:03,790
Now the thing is,
it's not just Jujitsu,

968
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:07,780
right? It's not just
Jujitsu, it's about business,

969
01:08:07,930 --> 01:08:11,080
it's about life,
it's about relationships.

970
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:16,220
It's about not getting stuck in a Rut.
And it's being

971
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:19,880
able, because it's another thing
is I, I was in my own head,

972
01:08:20,330 --> 01:08:21,800
I didn't detach from the situation.

973
01:08:21,801 --> 01:08:25,310
I didn't look at it from another
position and say, okay, you know,

974
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:28,760
this is getting worse right now.
I just was stuck there mentally.

975
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:34,240
So you gotta think you gotta you gotta
think about your rules objectively.

976
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:39,680
And I didn't do that. And it's a rule
that has, has, has saved me many times,

977
01:08:40,130 --> 01:08:44,300
but this time it,
it cost me nearly dearly.

978
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:48,140
So don't let your rules rule you.

979
01:08:49,010 --> 01:08:53,720
You gotta keep ruling your rules, don't
let you rules rule you. Yeah. You, um,

980
01:08:54,350 --> 01:08:58,370
another way to kind of look at that as
like a black and white mind, you know,

981
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:04,000
like don't stick it in your mind is
more or less black and white for sure.

982
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:06,470
Well, as far as how you
think, generally speaking,

983
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:11,270
but don't neglect the gray is so much
gray in there. And of course, you know,

984
01:09:11,271 --> 01:09:14,180
if you ever rules in their solid
rules, man, yes, stick to those rules.

985
01:09:14,181 --> 01:09:16,250
But like I said,
don't neglect the gray.

986
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:19,610
You know how you say you got to break
rule every once in a while. Don't be just,

987
01:09:19,670 --> 01:09:23,240
hey, ruler meant to be broken. Let's
just break it. Not, don't do that.

988
01:09:23,241 --> 01:09:26,070
People can use that as a, uh,
some people use that as a, uh,

989
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:29,630
excuse just to do whatever they
yeah, exactly. They're wrong too.

990
01:09:29,631 --> 01:09:30,650
They lack the discipline.

991
01:09:34,390 --> 01:09:39,010
Next question. Let's do it. I'm glad
you used that amount of skip by the way,

992
01:09:40,450 --> 01:09:41,283
check.

993
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:49,020
Do you have any advice on consoling a
member of your team that you're leading?

994
01:09:49,510 --> 01:09:52,360
Who knows they're to
blame for the project?

995
01:09:52,361 --> 01:09:57,361
Failing or falling through the
person in question is a great worker,

996
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:03,460
but just made an honest mistake that cost
that caused the failure of the project.

997
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:07,270
They feel extremely guilty for putting
my job at risk and I can't convey to them

998
01:10:07,271 --> 01:10:12,271
enough that I understand it was an honest
mistake and then I personally failed

999
01:10:12,671 --> 01:10:14,140
to communicate enough with them.

1000
01:10:14,470 --> 01:10:18,460
I think it's a great thing this
person is so passionate at their job,

1001
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:23,880
but is there any way I can get them to
distance themselves and show them that

1002
01:10:24,401 --> 01:10:27,370
this one failure is
not that big of a deal?

1003
01:10:30,370 --> 01:10:31,203
So,

1004
01:10:32,430 --> 01:10:35,550
um, yeah, like, like the,

1005
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,120
the question says it's cool that you
got somebody that's passionate. Right.

1006
01:10:39,121 --> 01:10:39,690
That's great.

1007
01:10:39,690 --> 01:10:42,120
And it sounds like they want to
take ownership and that's great too.

1008
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:47,340
It sounds like they are having
trouble moving on. So in this case,

1009
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:50,850
no, no major complications.
Is it not that big of a deal?

1010
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,980
You just got to talk them through it.
And for me,

1011
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:56,600
I would use probably some kind of sub,
you know,

1012
01:10:56,610 --> 01:10:58,350
some stories are real simple.

1013
01:10:58,351 --> 01:11:00,810
One is like about parachuting
and if you're parachuting,

1014
01:11:00,811 --> 01:11:05,280
one of the main training
points when you're parachuting
and something goes wrong

1015
01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:10,730
is you don't get focused on just trying
to fix the bad shoot because that's what

1016
01:11:11,341 --> 01:11:14,040
gets people killed. They're
looking up, they maybe they can

1017
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,320
save the shoot,
they think they can make an open somehow.

1018
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:18,990
And the next thing you know,
they hit the ground right and they die.

1019
01:11:19,230 --> 01:11:23,790
So what they do is they,
they teach you that, hey,

1020
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:24,900
you got a bad shoot.
You know,

1021
01:11:24,901 --> 01:11:27,480
you pull your main parachute
and it doesn't open correctly.

1022
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:30,150
You take a look at it, you go, okay,
is this thing gonna open or not?

1023
01:11:30,151 --> 01:11:35,130
You make a decision and then you cut it
away and it's gone and you focus on the

1024
01:11:35,131 --> 01:11:38,250
next thing, which is getting your reserve
fair. She'd come out to save your life.

1025
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:42,180
The one that didn't open, it
doesn't matter anymore. So move on.

1026
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:45,480
You can think about it like a, uh,
like a shooting competition too.

1027
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:48,690
Cause it's the same thing.
You, when you're shooting,

1028
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:50,670
you don't want to shoot.

1029
01:11:50,671 --> 01:11:54,720
You didn't want to think about the last
shot that you just missed and you don't

1030
01:11:54,721 --> 01:11:58,320
want to think about the next shot that's
a hard shot or a far shot or you don't

1031
01:11:58,321 --> 01:11:59,520
want to think about those other shots.

1032
01:11:59,910 --> 01:12:01,620
You want to think about the
shot that you're taking.

1033
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:03,420
That's the one that you
want to think about.

1034
01:12:03,810 --> 01:12:06,600
And if you're getting caught in the past,

1035
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:11,790
it's going to ruin what you're trying
to do in the present. So you, you know,

1036
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:13,710
you have to move on. This is
something that this, you know,

1037
01:12:13,711 --> 01:12:16,740
you got to explain to your employee
that's good. You'd look, listen,

1038
01:12:16,890 --> 01:12:19,710
I understand that you, that you had a
rough time. If you can't let that go,

1039
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:22,560
it's going to screw up the project we're
working on now. So let's let that go.

1040
01:12:22,561 --> 01:12:25,290
Let's move on. So that's what I'd
say to them. Say, listen, look buddy,

1041
01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:30,600
I know this one went bad. I get it.
You feel bad. Appreciate it. It's over.

1042
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:35,670
It's in the past. Let's take the
lessons learned and we got to move on.

1043
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:39,210
Let's not dwell on yesterday.
If we dwell on yesterday,

1044
01:12:39,211 --> 01:12:42,090
it takes our focus off
of today and tomorrow,

1045
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:43,800
which are the things we
can actually control.

1046
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:46,200
We can actually control
what we're doing today.

1047
01:12:46,290 --> 01:12:48,060
We can actually control what
we're going to do tomorrow.

1048
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:51,240
We don't have any control over what
happened yesterday that's gone.

1049
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:56,510
So what I need you to do is focus on
this mission now and making sure we

1050
01:12:58,200 --> 01:12:59,670
executed 100%

1051
01:13:00,450 --> 01:13:05,450
that that sense of or that access
to control over over a situation.

1052
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:10,760
That's so critical to to know when you're
in that position because to know what

1053
01:13:11,310 --> 01:13:14,190
to know that that you,
you drove it to have it on the phone.

1054
01:13:14,191 --> 01:13:17,250
You can and cannot do what you
can control yet. Like I said,

1055
01:13:17,251 --> 01:13:20,490
have access to that cause it feels,
it's horse feelings though.

1056
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:24,900
It feels like use the parachute analogy,
it feels like Dang,

1057
01:13:25,350 --> 01:13:28,020
there's the problem. The
parachute, that's the problem.

1058
01:13:28,021 --> 01:13:32,390
So of all my attention and all
my emotional energy is, is,

1059
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:35,730
is on that, that's the
problem. But like you said,

1060
01:13:35,731 --> 01:13:39,840
if you just honored to focus on the fact
that hey, I can't control that bad shoe,

1061
01:13:39,841 --> 01:13:44,520
that pet food is gone and cutting
away and yeah, focusing on the thing.

1062
01:13:44,521 --> 01:13:46,720
But like I said, man, that's the,

1063
01:13:46,730 --> 01:13:49,530
that's the key right there to
understand that men, you don't,

1064
01:13:49,531 --> 01:13:52,020
you don't have control over that anymore.
We're done with that.

1065
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,650
We're not doing that anymore.
Yeah.

1066
01:13:54,260 --> 01:13:54,691
Yeah.
And you know,

1067
01:13:54,691 --> 01:13:57,390
I should have said that on the last
one about talking about breaking rules.

1068
01:13:57,420 --> 01:14:00,780
I said business, I said life, I forgot
to say combat, but combat's the same way.

1069
01:14:00,781 --> 01:14:04,170
If you get stuck in a standard operating
procedure and you won't see your way

1070
01:14:04,171 --> 01:14:08,070
out of it, you're gonna, you're gonna
pay and to, same thing in combat.

1071
01:14:08,071 --> 01:14:12,250
If you make one bad decision on the
battlefield and now you start dwelling on

1072
01:14:12,251 --> 01:14:14,790
that bad decision, you've got to
forget about that. You got to move on,

1073
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:18,580
you got to move forward. So, you
know, the only reason you look back,

1074
01:14:18,790 --> 01:14:20,800
it's just assessed the lessons learned.

1075
01:14:20,801 --> 01:14:23,200
You're going to take away from it and
then turn back around and look forward.

1076
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:26,980
Don't get sucked into the past and get
drowned and pulled back there cause you

1077
01:14:26,981 --> 01:14:30,820
can't control it. You can't change
what happened. Yeah. Move on buddy.

1078
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,051
That other question,

1079
01:14:32,051 --> 01:14:35,230
the black and white mine one or
are you breaking your own rules?

1080
01:14:35,870 --> 01:14:39,730
You're one rule kind of like,
um, on, on Ghostbusters one.

1081
01:14:40,150 --> 01:14:44,560
Don't cross the streams you ever
watch goes with, yeah. Same thing man.

1082
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:46,980
But then they had to eventually write,

1083
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:50,680
they had to cross the streams streams
to kill that. The daemon. Yeah.

1084
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:54,610
You're leading shit man. I think you
actually intentionally tried to do this.

1085
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:59,470
That was a little reach outs. A little
regional. Those are understandable terms.

1086
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:01,263
Okay.

1087
01:15:05,150 --> 01:15:05,983
Juggle.

1088
01:15:06,630 --> 01:15:07,463
Okay.

1089
01:15:09,870 --> 01:15:13,110
What's the best advice heading into the
military? Straight from high school.

1090
01:15:15,550 --> 01:15:20,440
And this, this question is actually from,
uh, my brothers from down under Cain,

1091
01:15:20,441 --> 01:15:23,160
Dover and Nicholas Bennet.
And they've been, uh,

1092
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:26,050
they've been down there in Australia,
getting there,

1093
01:15:26,110 --> 01:15:29,460
getting there 4:00 AM wake up
challenge on for about, I don't know,

1094
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:32,080
35 or 40 days there at this point.
And what's cool,

1095
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:35,890
what's been cool is hearing their feedback
as they've kind of turned their lives

1096
01:15:35,891 --> 01:15:38,760
around and they're getting all this
stuff done. And actually, you know,

1097
01:15:38,770 --> 01:15:40,000
it was hilarious. He sent, uh,

1098
01:15:40,390 --> 01:15:44,560
one of them said a tweet with a picture
of a text conversation with some company

1099
01:15:44,561 --> 01:15:47,320
that they were trying to work
with and he said something like,

1100
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:50,450
the time on the tweet was f,
you know,

1101
01:15:50,470 --> 01:15:54,100
five oh one in the morning or something
like that. And you know, he said, hey,

1102
01:15:54,101 --> 01:15:57,430
are you still offering blank
or some program or whatever.

1103
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:01,190
And then the response was,
yes, we are still offering
that. And then, and then the,

1104
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:03,250
you know, the reply was, okay,

1105
01:16:03,251 --> 01:16:06,340
I'm really interested in accessing
that program or whatever.

1106
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:11,140
And the response was, okay, but
don't text people at 5:00 AM.

1107
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:16,600
And then the response to that
was, okay, wake up earlier. Yeah.

1108
01:16:16,690 --> 01:16:18,940
Which I thought that was classic.
So those guys are rocking.

1109
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:23,230
It's very cool to see. Uh, so,
and it's actually one of the,

1110
01:16:23,231 --> 01:16:26,200
and I forget which one of them, one of
those brothers is going in the military,

1111
01:16:26,201 --> 01:16:27,160
which is awesome.
Very cool.

1112
01:16:27,161 --> 01:16:30,310
To See Australian military
work with them a little bit,

1113
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,040
actually work with them
on a small level a lot.

1114
01:16:33,041 --> 01:16:36,100
Meaning that I work with a couple of
their soldiers a lot over the years,

1115
01:16:36,101 --> 01:16:39,430
but I never worked with them in a big
unit, but they were great guys. Uh,

1116
01:16:39,490 --> 01:16:42,760
here's a couple real simple things and
I'm assuming that he's going into some

1117
01:16:42,761 --> 01:16:45,030
kind of army or some kind of ground force.

1118
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:49,420
He's going to be a trooper on the ground,
obviously be in shape,

1119
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:52,240
do runs, do pushups, do
sit ups, do pull ups.

1120
01:16:53,110 --> 01:16:55,450
I would say be ready to march in boots.

1121
01:16:55,480 --> 01:17:00,480
That's one of the things that you do in
any infantry unit that is shocking to

1122
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:01,443
civilians,

1123
01:17:01,690 --> 01:17:06,280
is putting on boots and putting on
rucksacks and walking long distances.

1124
01:17:06,370 --> 01:17:09,700
Why did, do your feet get like
you're faking trashed? It's,

1125
01:17:09,730 --> 01:17:12,130
it's just a different kind of exercise.
You know,

1126
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:13,850
we talked about before humper rock man,

1127
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:17,460
you gotta just put on a rock and hump a
rock and you got to wear whatever foot

1128
01:17:17,470 --> 01:17:18,560
where they're going to supply you.

1129
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:23,270
Try and get the closest thing to that
and get your feet ready for it so that

1130
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:27,710
you, so that you don't get your feet
destroyed. Be comfortable in the water.

1131
01:17:27,711 --> 01:17:31,610
So most military has some kind
of water testing, you know,

1132
01:17:31,611 --> 01:17:34,700
where they're going to throw you in
the pool, whatever. Uh, you know,

1133
01:17:34,701 --> 01:17:36,230
going with a normal haircut,

1134
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:38,920
it's not going to make that big of a
deal because you know they're going to

1135
01:17:38,921 --> 01:17:41,780
shave your head within moments of showing
up. So that's not that big of a deal,

1136
01:17:41,781 --> 01:17:46,000
but a detached, okay, you're going to
get these crappy situations. Worse.

1137
01:17:46,030 --> 01:17:48,980
People knew yelling at you, they're
making you much stuff. Just detach. Just,

1138
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:53,720
just detach and watch it.
Cause the drill instructors are hilarious.

1139
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:58,220
And if you're, if you're
getting, if they're in your
face, you can be like, damn,

1140
01:17:58,221 --> 01:18:00,500
this is harsh.
But if they're in your face,

1141
01:18:00,501 --> 01:18:03,710
but you're watching it
from a free place of mind,

1142
01:18:03,711 --> 01:18:05,570
it's so awesome to watch and it's so fun.

1143
01:18:05,571 --> 01:18:08,180
It's so easy to understand
what they're doing. You know,

1144
01:18:08,181 --> 01:18:11,600
you got to remember they're not going
to kill you in training, uh, and,

1145
01:18:11,601 --> 01:18:14,630
and enjoy it.
I had fun,

1146
01:18:14,631 --> 01:18:18,560
I had fun in all my indoctrination
courses, which is, you know,

1147
01:18:18,561 --> 01:18:21,830
you're all your courses where you're
getting treated like a recruit.

1148
01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:26,300
So for me it was bootcamp, it was
bud's, it was airborne school and,

1149
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:29,270
and really an ocs to officer
candidate school. All those things.

1150
01:18:29,271 --> 01:18:31,820
I had a great time.
I had had a blast at those schools.

1151
01:18:31,821 --> 01:18:33,650
I had fun getting indoctrinated,

1152
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:38,530
I embraced the little rules that
they throw on outside of on,

1153
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:41,720
and I take them to the extreme and I,
that's, that's how I ended up having fun,

1154
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:46,020
fun with it. And then the
last thing I would say, and,

1155
01:18:46,170 --> 01:18:50,330
and I actually, I almost
missed this, but this is,

1156
01:18:51,170 --> 01:18:55,580
this might be the most important
thing. Okay. So you're 18 years old,

1157
01:18:55,581 --> 01:18:59,840
you just got done with high school. You
show up in the military and guess what?

1158
01:18:59,841 --> 01:19:01,580
You start getting a paycheck.

1159
01:19:02,330 --> 01:19:05,480
All of a sudden you're the richest guy
in the world because it Mickey D's,

1160
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:09,620
you were making seven 50 an hour and
all of a sudden now you're getting a fat

1161
01:19:09,621 --> 01:19:13,490
paycheck. Have, you know, $2,200 a month.

1162
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:16,610
But you don't have any expenses cause
you're in the barracks or whatever.

1163
01:19:16,611 --> 01:19:18,140
You've got all your food coming to you.

1164
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:22,940
So what are you going to
do with that money? Well, a
lot of guys in the military,

1165
01:19:23,390 --> 01:19:25,880
what they do with that
money is they blow it,

1166
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:31,610
they blow it on women and whiskey
and they get the big toys, right?

1167
01:19:31,611 --> 01:19:33,050
They get the massive toys,

1168
01:19:33,051 --> 01:19:37,130
they get the massive trucks and
motorcycles and Harley's and,

1169
01:19:37,131 --> 01:19:40,040
and everything like got, I'm not,
I got nothing against those things.

1170
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:44,810
But what you need to do is
save your money and you know,

1171
01:19:44,811 --> 01:19:48,770
they throw figures around 15% of
your paycheck, 20% of your paycheck,

1172
01:19:48,771 --> 01:19:49,730
10% of your paycheck,

1173
01:19:49,731 --> 01:19:54,731
but put that money somewhere longterm
where you're going to grow it.

1174
01:19:55,310 --> 01:19:58,250
And then I would tell you,
you know, just buy a house,

1175
01:19:58,730 --> 01:20:03,350
buy a house and then rent out the rooms
to three guys and you sleep on the couch

1176
01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:08,310
and have them be paying your mortgage.
And when you get them all stabilized

1177
01:20:08,310 --> 01:20:09,610
in that mortgage is kind of covered.

1178
01:20:09,630 --> 01:20:13,020
Go buy another house and
do that every few years.

1179
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,330
And there's no reason

1180
01:20:16,830 --> 01:20:19,680
to retire from the military and
not be completely set. Well,

1181
01:20:19,681 --> 01:20:24,681
you'd ever have to work again if you
just don't blow all your money on stuff

1182
01:20:27,091 --> 01:20:30,680
that you don't need. And I'm not saying
you got to live like a monk, right?

1183
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:34,860
But just don't blow all of it.
Blow some of it.

1184
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:38,790
Don't blow all of it. And that's a,
that's a real important to all the,

1185
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:43,610
all the folks joined the military or
nude in the military. You, you can, uh,

1186
01:20:43,650 --> 01:20:44,490
you can make that happen.

1187
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:50,010
Financial discipline equals financial
freedom. There you go. That's good.

1188
01:20:51,390 --> 01:20:56,370
Next question. I'm a
firefighter. Slash. Paramedic.

1189
01:20:56,820 --> 01:21:01,260
Historically, my profession has
always been composed of Alpha men

1190
01:21:02,910 --> 01:21:05,850
and all he had to worry about with
teaching the skill and not the aggressive

1191
01:21:05,851 --> 01:21:08,340
side of a person that
is key within this job.

1192
01:21:08,850 --> 01:21:10,950
We now face the new generation
where they're hiring,

1193
01:21:10,951 --> 01:21:12,780
thought they're hiring softer men,

1194
01:21:13,590 --> 01:21:17,700
quote unquote softer men due to upper
management and human resources criteria.

1195
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:22,170
So when you, when you get these guys
that drive that is needed to do the job,

1196
01:21:22,171 --> 01:21:24,660
it's not there.
I truly,

1197
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:28,800
I truly believe that our
profession is a calling. Uh,

1198
01:21:28,801 --> 01:21:33,270
that goes for all public servants in
military alike. So my question to you is,

1199
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:36,630
how do you instill aggression or passion?
How do you instill it?

1200
01:21:37,530 --> 01:21:41,250
How do you turn a soft man into
an Alpha male skill can be taught,

1201
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:44,040
but aggression and passion
is where I come up short,

1202
01:21:44,130 --> 01:21:48,120
intend to get frustrated because some
people don't love this job the way I do.

1203
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:53,450
Those soft men will potentially be put
in a position where they may have to pull

1204
01:21:53,951 --> 01:21:57,600
me out of a fire or even save someone's
life. And aggression will be key.

1205
01:21:58,320 --> 01:21:59,153
Call me crazy.

1206
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:04,520
But I'd rather have the Alpha male they
gets after it on a daily basis to pull

1207
01:22:04,561 --> 01:22:06,210
me out. Yeah, no doubt about that.

1208
01:22:06,270 --> 01:22:08,640
You want to have the guy that's going to
be aggressive and make things happen at

1209
01:22:08,641 --> 01:22:11,820
the moment of truth. So how do you do
that? How do you instill that? Well,

1210
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:15,960
number one, hard training. You know, you
got to set up training for your people.

1211
01:22:16,170 --> 01:22:21,100
That is tough, that challenges them.
And at first there'll be some, you know,

1212
01:22:21,180 --> 01:22:23,040
complaining about it and whatever else.

1213
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:27,780
But eventually people start to embrace
that heart draining and it starts to make

1214
01:22:27,781 --> 01:22:32,640
them feel proud.
And that's what you want them to do.

1215
01:22:32,641 --> 01:22:37,641
You want to push them mentally and
physically and you want to have them

1216
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:43,520
understand a very important
premise because if you take
the fact that these guys

1217
01:22:45,151 --> 01:22:49,240
are, let's call them softer,
well that means they,

1218
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:52,770
they want to have like, you know,
they want to be safe, right? Well,

1219
01:22:52,830 --> 01:22:57,830
you need to teach these guys that the
best way to mitigate risk is to be

1220
01:22:58,801 --> 01:23:01,980
aggressive, right? If you
want to mitigate risk,

1221
01:23:03,210 --> 01:23:06,010
the best way to mitigate
risk is to be aggressive.

1222
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:10,570
So example, if you think of fights
going to happen, what's the best way to,

1223
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:13,210
you know, control that
situation is to be aggressive,

1224
01:23:13,270 --> 01:23:15,010
if to aggressively attack the enemy.

1225
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:18,700
If you're in a gun fighting situation
and someone's attacking you,

1226
01:23:18,701 --> 01:23:20,770
what's the best thing to do?
It's flank them and attack them.

1227
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:26,140
You want to be aggressive in a firefight.
If you're fighting a fire,

1228
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:28,510
you want to fight the fire,
right?

1229
01:23:28,511 --> 01:23:30,730
You don't want to let the fire
burn and get out of control.

1230
01:23:30,731 --> 01:23:33,190
You want to aggressively
get the fire under control.

1231
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:35,970
So aggression is the best
way to mitigate risks.

1232
01:23:35,971 --> 01:23:40,971
So get these guys in that mentality of
where they recognize that the aggression

1233
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:44,650
is an important facet
of what they're doing.

1234
01:23:44,651 --> 01:23:47,170
And you want to put them in training
scenarios where the aggression wins and

1235
01:23:47,171 --> 01:23:50,560
passivity loses. You know, you want to put
them in situation where, Oh, guess what?

1236
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:53,380
You sat back and waited and now
we've got the whole building on fire.

1237
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:57,700
Or you sat back and waited and now the
people that we could rescue three minutes

1238
01:23:57,701 --> 01:24:01,420
ago are going to die because you
hesitated at the moment of truth.

1239
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:06,280
So you gotta teach them
that aggressiveness over
and over and over again.

1240
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:12,040
And I think that's, that's,
that's what you gotta do. Um,

1241
01:24:13,210 --> 01:24:18,030
I know that
I want one at once.

1242
01:24:18,031 --> 01:24:20,590
You'll officer that I was working with,

1243
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:25,300
we are going through land warfare training
and land warfare training is you got

1244
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:30,460
machine guns firing, you got rockets
going off, you've got smoke grenades,

1245
01:24:30,461 --> 01:24:32,530
it's mayhem.
And if you're gonna,

1246
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:36,220
you have to grab control of the situation.

1247
01:24:36,310 --> 01:24:39,490
So you're doing what we call immediate
action drills and everyone's shooting

1248
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:44,200
live fire and they're maneuvering
and you've got to grab control of the

1249
01:24:44,230 --> 01:24:49,230
situation and you've got to make things
happen aggressively through force of

1250
01:24:50,261 --> 01:24:55,210
will. And so this once you officer
who I thought was great guy, he, he,

1251
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:58,660
he like wasn't making it happen.
He wasn't being aggressive enough.

1252
01:25:00,190 --> 01:25:01,990
And I said to him, I said, hey
man, you got to be more aggressive.

1253
01:25:01,991 --> 01:25:06,970
You've got to get you going to get
fired up with your guys. And he said,

1254
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:09,310
I literally said to me, I remember
it like it was yesterday. He goes,

1255
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:13,720
I don't know if I can get any
more fired up. And I said,

1256
01:25:15,370 --> 01:25:20,140
okay, hang with me. And I just,

1257
01:25:20,141 --> 01:25:21,550
just,
just follow me.

1258
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:26,920
And I took command of his
squad of eight guys and I said,

1259
01:25:26,921 --> 01:25:28,480
just follow me.
So we went,

1260
01:25:28,481 --> 01:25:31,750
we got into contact drill and
the shooting started and boom,

1261
01:25:31,810 --> 01:25:33,280
I showed him what aggression look like.

1262
01:25:33,730 --> 01:25:36,640
Hey [inaudible] jokes that
upon us corner right there,

1263
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,280
you get up there and started laying down,

1264
01:25:39,281 --> 01:25:43,630
fire you over here start getting head
count that you yelling, placing guys,

1265
01:25:43,690 --> 01:25:48,070
making it happen through force of will.
It's being aggressive.

1266
01:25:48,970 --> 01:25:49,661
And it was,

1267
01:25:49,661 --> 01:25:54,610
that was all it took was like he just
didn't understand the difference.

1268
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:59,050
He didn't understand what aggression
look like and he didn't understand how it

1269
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:03,410
impacted the situation. When you're not
being aggressive out on the battlefield,

1270
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:06,410
the you have no control,
things will, things will just,

1271
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:09,620
things will just happen and you
will have no control over them. So,

1272
01:26:09,830 --> 01:26:13,400
and guess what?
It's the same thing in life.

1273
01:26:13,940 --> 01:26:16,910
If you're not aggressively
pursuing your goals again,

1274
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:22,720
that doesn't mean you're aggressively
confronting people at every turn.

1275
01:26:24,051 --> 01:26:24,351
No,

1276
01:26:24,351 --> 01:26:29,351
it means you're aggressively pursuing
your goals through any means necessary.

1277
01:26:29,990 --> 01:26:34,160
It does. Again, people get confused and
think that I'm in someone's place. Hey,

1278
01:26:34,161 --> 01:26:37,910
we're doing this my way. No, no, no.
You're aggressively pursuing your goals.

1279
01:26:37,911 --> 01:26:39,830
You're not aggressively pursuing people.

1280
01:26:39,890 --> 01:26:42,050
You're not aggressively
pursuing personalities.

1281
01:26:42,170 --> 01:26:45,110
You're not aggressively confronting
people. You're confronting the challenge,

1282
01:26:45,111 --> 01:26:48,890
not the people. Do you have to confront
people? Sometimes? Yes, of course you do,

1283
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:53,330
but you're aggressively confronting
and attacking the challenge,

1284
01:26:53,390 --> 01:26:57,470
the mission, not the
people, but he, but anyways,

1285
01:26:57,471 --> 01:27:00,440
this guy didn't quite understand,
so I had to show him.

1286
01:27:00,441 --> 01:27:04,790
I had to let him see what
that looked like, what it
looked like to say, you know,

1287
01:27:04,791 --> 01:27:08,300
hey, take it out right here. Grab a
guy and say stat a corner right here.

1288
01:27:08,330 --> 01:27:11,240
Start moving guys. And, and have
them see that. And guess what?

1289
01:27:11,270 --> 01:27:13,310
Then you get at the other people in the,

1290
01:27:13,820 --> 01:27:16,960
in the squad start seeing
it and they start acting,

1291
01:27:17,330 --> 01:27:20,330
acting aggressively to make things happen.
And that's,

1292
01:27:21,830 --> 01:27:24,780
that's when you do it. That's,
that's, that's what you do. And,

1293
01:27:24,850 --> 01:27:29,850
and obviously what that
means is you as a leader,

1294
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:31,213
you have to lead.

1295
01:27:31,340 --> 01:27:35,780
You have to show these guys the way w
how important aggression is and how to do

1296
01:27:35,781 --> 01:27:36,614
it.

1297
01:27:37,430 --> 01:27:41,690
Yeah. In kind of in life, I
think you can, because again,

1298
01:27:41,691 --> 01:27:44,420
it's one of those things that,
that sounds pretty simple.

1299
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:47,750
It's either be aggressive or you're
not being aggressive kind of thing.

1300
01:27:47,751 --> 01:27:51,410
But it's so hard because like for example,
if you're in life,

1301
01:27:52,430 --> 01:27:55,280
a lot of people they sit back and
wait for things to kind of happen.

1302
01:27:55,281 --> 01:27:56,180
Like while I'm waiting,
you know,

1303
01:27:56,181 --> 01:27:59,120
you hear people say and he just hasn't
happened for me yet and I'm waiting for

1304
01:27:59,121 --> 01:28:02,510
my big break kind of thing. No
wrong attitude. Yeah, exactly.

1305
01:28:02,530 --> 01:28:06,470
But when you're in that situation it
kind of seems like that's how the world

1306
01:28:06,471 --> 01:28:07,304
works.

1307
01:28:07,820 --> 01:28:12,760
So it doesn't and a lot of it maybe how
people are raised, I don't know. Um,

1308
01:28:13,610 --> 01:28:17,960
where if,
if you don't know what that is,

1309
01:28:17,961 --> 01:28:21,530
that if you don't have access to that
feeling of being an aggressive person,

1310
01:28:21,531 --> 01:28:26,060
it's hard to get there until like how
you said if someone shows you like in the

1311
01:28:26,061 --> 01:28:29,470
exact situation that you're in and in
your case it was that one specific Gulf

1312
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:33,290
training situation you showed them
how so it probably clicked right away.

1313
01:28:33,291 --> 01:28:36,320
But in life there's all these situations.

1314
01:28:36,321 --> 01:28:40,220
So just to be an aggressive person might
be kind of hard for someone to access

1315
01:28:40,790 --> 01:28:43,750
unless they had like a mentor or
something or someone who demonstrated it.

1316
01:28:43,870 --> 01:28:45,550
Definitely is.
It definitely is hard in life.

1317
01:28:45,551 --> 01:28:49,720
It's hard to show people all the different
situations and because then you also

1318
01:28:49,721 --> 01:28:52,790
can end up with people that
are overly aggressive, right?

1319
01:28:52,810 --> 01:28:55,600
Or aggressive on the wrong
thing, aggressive in the
wrong direction. You know?

1320
01:28:55,601 --> 01:28:56,680
I said,
this is something that someone,

1321
01:28:56,681 --> 01:29:00,130
the other day they were talking about
being there, talking about like,

1322
01:29:00,131 --> 01:29:02,880
I'm super passionate about
this, and I said, don't aim.

1323
01:29:02,881 --> 01:29:06,750
You're passionate the people. Yeah,
because people find that offensive. Yeah.

1324
01:29:06,810 --> 01:29:11,190
You got to aim your passion at
the mission and let live. I mean,

1325
01:29:11,191 --> 01:29:15,780
there'll be some collateral encouragement
when people see someone that's fired

1326
01:29:15,781 --> 01:29:17,730
up.
When people see someone that's passionate,

1327
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:20,550
it makes people excited
about the mission as well.

1328
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:25,560
But if I hit you with my passion,
if I aim my passion at you,

1329
01:29:25,890 --> 01:29:29,550
all of a sudden you're intimidated by
it. You're turned off by it, you're deaf,

1330
01:29:29,551 --> 01:29:32,910
made defensive by it.
And so that's what you have to be careful.

1331
01:29:32,911 --> 01:29:37,770
If you want to aim your passion,
aim your aggression at the mission,

1332
01:29:37,890 --> 01:29:39,030
not at the people.

1333
01:29:39,510 --> 01:29:41,520
What you want to do with people
that you want to influence them.

1334
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:44,610
You want to steer them,
you want to pull them along,

1335
01:29:44,611 --> 01:29:46,890
you want to make them give them the idea.

1336
01:29:46,891 --> 01:29:50,460
So they think that they're moving
in that direction on their own.

1337
01:29:50,610 --> 01:29:52,440
You actually want them to
be, nevermind. Thank you.

1338
01:29:52,441 --> 01:29:55,950
Want them to move in that direction
on their own. That's leadership.

1339
01:29:56,130 --> 01:29:58,020
And so that's what you got to do
with this aggressive thing. It's uh,

1340
01:29:58,060 --> 01:30:01,020
it's definitely a really good question.
I would also say, you know what,

1341
01:30:02,250 --> 01:30:06,570
what music are they listening to? What,
what, what TV shows are they watching?

1342
01:30:06,571 --> 01:30:10,020
What movies are they watching?
Are they watching UFC straight up?

1343
01:30:10,021 --> 01:30:14,790
Are they watching people fight?
Are you doing any training?

1344
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:18,780
Are you hitting bags?
Are you throwing some Moy Thai kicks?

1345
01:30:19,230 --> 01:30:23,850
Are you grappling, you know, do
those things raise aggression levels?

1346
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:27,480
Are they working out hard?
You know, like no kidding.

1347
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:32,220
Squatting heavy weights increases
your testosterone period.

1348
01:30:32,730 --> 01:30:33,990
It really does.

1349
01:30:34,140 --> 01:30:39,140
So get on the squat rack and start
getting that testosterone flowing through

1350
01:30:39,661 --> 01:30:40,494
your system.

1351
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:49,170
Let's go to the next question.
Okay. Be Aggressive on that one.

1352
01:30:49,410 --> 01:30:53,250
Just be aggressive and lead aggressively.
Yeah. Funny how you mentioned UFC,

1353
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:58,680
cause you can kind of in that regard
you can learn a little bit cause you can

1354
01:30:58,681 --> 01:31:03,450
hear like you always hear the coach
or whatever yelling thing be first,

1355
01:31:03,451 --> 01:31:05,760
be first, be first, I'll count
and stuff like that. Yeah.

1356
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:10,040
You definitely don't hear him say hey
sit back and wait to get attached. Yeah,

1357
01:31:10,050 --> 01:31:14,630
exactly. Then you don't really ever say,
okay, be defensive. Yeah. Or be passing.

1358
01:31:14,660 --> 01:31:19,500
Yeah, exactly. It doesn't happen.
Next question. Um, some Jujitsu talk.

1359
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:24,810
What type of style do you
play? Aggressive, passive,

1360
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:28,960
reactive or smashing paths,
et Cetera,

1361
01:31:29,330 --> 01:31:32,880
et cetera. Well, I mean I've
trained with you. You probably,

1362
01:31:34,410 --> 01:31:37,560
you know, have an assessment,
your assessment of my game,

1363
01:31:37,561 --> 01:31:39,540
which will be a limited
assessment by the way,

1364
01:31:40,020 --> 01:31:44,460
because the game that I show you is the,
is the,

1365
01:31:44,970 --> 01:31:47,880
is built to contend with
what you bring to the table.

1366
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:51,300
If you brought something else,
you'd see something else. Yeah.

1367
01:31:51,490 --> 01:31:56,310
And I have a little bit
beyond that because I witness
you and dean all the time.

1368
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:00,070
More so before that nowadays. But yeah, I

1369
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:03,010
would say my assessment. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

1370
01:32:03,011 --> 01:32:05,170
So you watch me other
people and you can see.

1371
01:32:05,171 --> 01:32:08,040
So you do see that I trained different
ways with other people. Yeah.

1372
01:32:08,070 --> 01:32:12,070
And really that's really the core
of the evaluation is that you, you,

1373
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:15,370
when you roll with people,
you, it's like you're real. Um,

1374
01:32:16,230 --> 01:32:20,590
it's like variable style,
you know, it changes. So,

1375
01:32:20,591 --> 01:32:21,940
and it depends on your mood too.

1376
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:26,430
Like if you're just messing around with
me or whatever, you're like, you know,

1377
01:32:26,650 --> 01:32:29,980
this is kind of weird, but you do
this thing that no one really does.

1378
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:33,730
And you look like you look me in the eye,
like while you're rolling,

1379
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:36,690
it's weird because I know you're
just messing with me. Like, oh,

1380
01:32:36,850 --> 01:32:39,670
like everything I do, you're like,
oh, that was cute. Kind of private,

1381
01:32:39,671 --> 01:32:44,290
kind of an attitude. And then,
you know, if I talked too
much, um, you know, whatever,

1382
01:32:44,291 --> 01:32:48,880
then you'll, you'll smash and
pass. So in regards to these,

1383
01:32:48,881 --> 01:32:53,440
these choices, um, all, all,
all of the above, right? So,

1384
01:32:53,490 --> 01:32:58,490
so passive when you're kind of taunting
and maybe even learning or not learning

1385
01:33:00,130 --> 01:33:03,280
style of Jujitsu. Yes. Yes
it is. It's your style.

1386
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:08,680
And so you'll be passive kind of
waiting for me to do something.

1387
01:33:08,681 --> 01:33:10,630
And then if it doesn't work,
then you taught some more.

1388
01:33:10,780 --> 01:33:13,810
And then so that's passive and
reactive is obviously, you know,

1389
01:33:13,900 --> 01:33:18,900
reacting to anything that I try to do
aggressive is when either time runs is

1390
01:33:19,781 --> 01:33:24,781
running short or I talk too much and
smash and pass is the result of that

1391
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:30,580
aggressive stuff in really in replace
of smash and pass. Oh, I mean,

1392
01:33:30,581 --> 01:33:31,960
I think the alternative for me is,

1393
01:33:32,020 --> 01:33:35,980
is a little something that we like
to call the disrespect, disrespect.

1394
01:33:36,220 --> 01:33:36,910
We just wouldn't,

1395
01:33:36,910 --> 01:33:40,450
it just completely disrespect the person's
guard and just pass and smash them.

1396
01:33:40,510 --> 01:33:44,890
Yeah, yeah. The disrespect for sure.
Yeah. And I think, I think, I think the

1397
01:33:44,890 --> 01:33:49,500
key point for this for me is that
I,

1398
01:33:49,620 --> 01:33:52,290
I know like I, I agree with you.
Like I have a decent guard. Um,

1399
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:56,620
I have a good top position, pretty good
at card passing, whatever. I'm not,

1400
01:33:56,650 --> 01:34:01,290
I'm not great at Jujitsu,
but I'm decent at some areas and I'm pre,

1401
01:34:01,410 --> 01:34:05,740
one thing I am is, I'm pretty comfortable,
like in just about any situation,

1402
01:34:05,770 --> 01:34:09,280
there's no situation where I'm, there's
no situation where I'm freaked out.

1403
01:34:09,550 --> 01:34:11,950
Like I don't mind being in half guard.
I don't mind being on a half guard,

1404
01:34:11,951 --> 01:34:15,220
top bottom. I don't mind being
guard, closed, open, whatever.

1405
01:34:15,221 --> 01:34:18,820
I don't mind being mounted. I can pretty
much handle any situation, you know?

1406
01:34:18,821 --> 01:34:22,060
And again, when you're training with
dean, it's did, you know, you get,

1407
01:34:22,090 --> 01:34:26,770
you get very comfortable
with people because you have
a guy that's just a savage.

1408
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:30,100
And um, but, but what's,

1409
01:34:30,130 --> 01:34:34,720
what's interesting about this is for
me, and I, and I talked about this,

1410
01:34:34,721 --> 01:34:36,490
I mean I talk about this,
there's a dichotomy here, right?

1411
01:34:36,550 --> 01:34:39,400
Like if being aggressive is not working,

1412
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:43,600
then you have to try that other game.
You know, I always say if you're,

1413
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:48,130
if you're trying to pass someone's guard
really close and you can't do it back

1414
01:34:48,131 --> 01:34:52,030
away because there's an opening
there and it's the same again,

1415
01:34:52,031 --> 01:34:54,460
it's the same thing with life,
right?

1416
01:34:54,490 --> 01:34:58,010
If you're beating your head against the
wall, try different route. When there's

1417
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:02,270
one door that's closed or
heavily defended in combat,

1418
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:05,840
go find another door, go breach
a window, go find another way.

1419
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:08,660
There is an opening somewhere else.

1420
01:35:09,650 --> 01:35:12,470
And I think that's what my game is.

1421
01:35:13,730 --> 01:35:17,930
I think that's what my game is, is
it's like you said variable. Yeah.

1422
01:35:18,260 --> 01:35:22,040
Based on a variety of

1423
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:28,610
influences both in my world
and in my opponent's world.

1424
01:35:28,670 --> 01:35:29,503
Yeah.

1425
01:35:30,630 --> 01:35:32,990
And surprisingly,
and I think that people,

1426
01:35:33,180 --> 01:35:37,590
a lot of people wouldn't really assume
this right away. Is that your um,

1427
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:41,100
yeah, sure. You're going to smash and
you're aggressive and kind of rough.

1428
01:35:41,130 --> 01:35:43,470
I'll let you know a lot of
times, but you're like, um,

1429
01:35:44,250 --> 01:35:46,920
like a playful Jujitsu guy.
You know,

1430
01:35:47,020 --> 01:35:49,510
I was going to say this and this is,
I think this is important.

1431
01:35:49,511 --> 01:35:53,770
I had a guy ask me, how
hard do you go? Right?

1432
01:35:53,950 --> 01:35:55,330
And the answer's very easy.

1433
01:35:55,780 --> 01:35:59,920
I go just hard enough that I'm
staying ahead of the other person

1434
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:02,610
now with you.

1435
01:36:02,620 --> 01:36:06,220
So those of you that are listening on
audio echoes making a face because there

1436
01:36:06,221 --> 01:36:09,160
are times when I have to step
up my game a little bit and,

1437
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:13,270
and put the wood on times where
it's straight up. That's not true.

1438
01:36:13,990 --> 01:36:18,370
Okay. Okay. Yeah. But
there might be some, oh,

1439
01:36:18,371 --> 01:36:21,280
you know why that's because
you come in with you.

1440
01:36:21,310 --> 01:36:26,140
We sometimes you come in with a,
you know, with an attitude of, yeah,

1441
01:36:26,170 --> 01:36:27,190
I can see it in your eyes.
You're like,

1442
01:36:27,191 --> 01:36:31,220
today's the day you come in there and
you got the series look on your face now.

1443
01:36:31,290 --> 01:36:35,140
Okay, cool. It's going to be like
that right on and see that. Yeah.

1444
01:36:35,141 --> 01:36:36,310
I have to bring in the eat a little bit.

1445
01:36:37,150 --> 01:36:41,250
Yeah, yeah. Fully. Yeah. But that same,

1446
01:36:41,310 --> 01:36:46,310
and this is the part where I think is
kind of kind of interesting is that you

1447
01:36:46,861 --> 01:36:50,040
do, it doesn't seem like a
war. Like it seems like a war,

1448
01:36:50,041 --> 01:36:54,980
but all within the confines of some silly,
not silly, but some game. Well game.

1449
01:36:55,260 --> 01:36:59,320
Yeah. But, but it's, it's
obvious though, you know, like I,

1450
01:36:59,330 --> 01:37:00,860
I think that someone who may be maybe

1451
01:37:00,870 --> 01:37:04,320
never seen your role or never had
that experience with you specifically,

1452
01:37:04,530 --> 01:37:06,600
they would assume that you're this like,

1453
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:09,630
hey [inaudible] I'm going to smash it.

1454
01:37:09,631 --> 01:37:12,890
And that meant in that I am taking
this really seriously. You know,

1455
01:37:13,090 --> 01:37:14,790
some guys are like
that. Yeah, that's true.

1456
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:18,270
It's not that I don't take
Jujitsu seriously, but did
you too? It's fun to me.

1457
01:37:18,610 --> 01:37:22,140
So fun to me. Yeah. And I
think that the better you get,

1458
01:37:22,141 --> 01:37:25,470
the more fun it gets and the less you
have to be like that, you know, in,

1459
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:29,760
I don't mind when people come at me like
that cause I still get to do the same

1460
01:37:29,761 --> 01:37:34,500
thing. You know? I still get to have
fun and yeah know Jujitsu should be fun.

1461
01:37:34,740 --> 01:37:37,410
You really should be fun,
have fun or it is for you.

1462
01:37:37,411 --> 01:37:39,300
The longer you're going to do it for now.

1463
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:43,530
Part of the fun can be submitting people
and you get people that that's the only

1464
01:37:43,531 --> 01:37:45,480
fund that they have in Jujitsu
is when they submit people.

1465
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:47,130
And that's not what I'm talking about.
Yeah.

1466
01:37:47,131 --> 01:37:49,960
I think that's kind of the
transitions and the, the,

1467
01:37:50,020 --> 01:37:54,930
the flowing and the utilizations
of moves and the cool things that,

1468
01:37:55,470 --> 01:37:58,740
and you don't, sometimes I'll be rolling
with whoever and it's like something,

1469
01:37:58,741 --> 01:38:01,740
just something like someone
will do something really
cool and you start laughing

1470
01:38:01,741 --> 01:38:04,810
like the hand, that was awesome.
That's Jujitsu. That's right.

1471
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:09,690
You did two should be fun. It
shouldn't be this. Uh, it shouldn't be,

1472
01:38:11,580 --> 01:38:15,450
it shouldn't be. The Fun shouldn't come
from just submitting people. Right.

1473
01:38:16,050 --> 01:38:20,430
That's just bullying, right? Yeah.
In a way. Yeah. And you know,

1474
01:38:20,431 --> 01:38:23,520
you shouldn't get, you should a certain
point, you go, you know what? Okay, cool.

1475
01:38:23,521 --> 01:38:25,560
I can tap people out, but let's, let's,

1476
01:38:25,590 --> 01:38:30,030
let's do this for the reason of the
Dysport itself, the, the game itself,

1477
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:31,380
which is a fun game.
Yeah.

1478
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:36,390
I know guys who told me straight up
that when they're driving up to the gym,

1479
01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:40,470
they have anxiety. Yeah. Anxiety.
Like, Oh God, am I going to do,

1480
01:38:40,471 --> 01:38:45,030
or if they get tapped out, it ruins their
day or their week or whatever. But no,

1481
01:38:45,031 --> 01:38:46,260
I have none of that heads.
Yeah,

1482
01:38:46,710 --> 01:38:50,130
I'm rolling at the John
Jim just in totally,

1483
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:51,760
totally happy to be,

1484
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:56,190
to be getting there and get and get to
do something that's so fun. Yeah. Yeah.

1485
01:38:56,191 --> 01:39:00,660
I rolled with the Chris Martin today for,
and it was all like,

1486
01:39:00,690 --> 01:39:01,680
you can make jokes,

1487
01:39:01,681 --> 01:39:06,681
you can talk trash and you can do all
this stuff while you're rolling and doing

1488
01:39:06,841 --> 01:39:11,840
that in this playful, I mean, don't be a
Dick, you know, but, but you know, yeah,

1489
01:39:11,841 --> 01:39:15,450
you can't, he can push being a dick
sometimes it makes it more fun for sure.

1490
01:39:15,490 --> 01:39:16,420
Like you can,
you know,

1491
01:39:16,530 --> 01:39:19,110
you can call a move and then do it on
the guy if you're better than him or

1492
01:39:19,111 --> 01:39:22,920
whatever. Cold blooded. But it makes it
fun though, you know? And me and Chris,

1493
01:39:22,921 --> 01:39:27,240
we were doing that the whole
time. I'm like, oh Ooh, how's
that feel kind of thing.

1494
01:39:27,540 --> 01:39:30,320
And of course that's taken to an extreme
because I know Chris for a long time,

1495
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:33,870
but talk a little bit of
that makes it more fun.

1496
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:35,700
Just like if you're playing a video game,

1497
01:39:35,701 --> 01:39:38,220
just like if you're playing
any other games, just talk
to them. Friends, you know,

1498
01:39:38,221 --> 01:39:40,650
it's, it's part of the
fun. And like I said,

1499
01:39:40,651 --> 01:39:44,730
my original point is I think people
wouldn't assume that about you,

1500
01:39:44,731 --> 01:39:49,340
given how you may come off sometimes,
but you're really like that. Hmm.

1501
01:39:49,620 --> 01:39:54,030
No, I do do to phone to me,
no doubt on splurge for sure.

1502
01:39:55,290 --> 01:39:59,940
Believe you're not Jujitsu in a way,
like when you're surfing in California,

1503
01:40:01,110 --> 01:40:06,000
there's, uh, there's a much
harder vibe surfing in California.

1504
01:40:06,490 --> 01:40:10,470
There isn't the mats for sure.
Oh yeah. You know, when, you
know, when we're surfing,

1505
01:40:10,471 --> 01:40:12,990
where I serve,
like it's,

1506
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:18,000
it's a gang mentality type situation,
you know? And so on the mats,

1507
01:40:18,001 --> 01:40:21,810
it's just so fun to be in a
situation and surfing, you know,

1508
01:40:21,811 --> 01:40:26,190
leads to fighting often oil and so,
but in Jujitsu,

1509
01:40:26,490 --> 01:40:30,690
the fighting is already happening,
right? So, so it's, you know, you can,

1510
01:40:30,710 --> 01:40:33,810
you're kind of over it and now, now
we're just, we're already fighting,

1511
01:40:33,811 --> 01:40:37,680
so now we can just chill, right?
Yeah, yeah. Sorry. It's crazy.

1512
01:40:37,681 --> 01:40:42,290
I'll surfing's like that. Right. Seems
to be this kind of zen thing. No, no, no,

1513
01:40:42,340 --> 01:40:44,160
you're supposed to, but it's
not, it's an aggressive,

1514
01:40:44,190 --> 01:40:46,810
it's a very aggressive environment.
Like a territorial thing.

1515
01:40:46,811 --> 01:40:51,390
It's a very territorial thing. Yeah.
Yeah. I bet it's kind of cool. I like it.

1516
01:40:51,890 --> 01:40:52,723
Like that

1517
01:40:57,280 --> 01:40:58,113
next question.

1518
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:03,790
I understand and agree with all your
thoughts and principles. However,

1519
01:41:05,350 --> 01:41:10,350
however I interpret your concepts for
leaders leading men were mostly driven or

1520
01:41:12,131 --> 01:41:13,260
other leaders who have,
um,

1521
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:18,160
a desire to make themselves better
in maintaining the status. Yep.

1522
01:41:18,220 --> 01:41:23,170
So common misperception,
right? Is that, you know,

1523
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:26,560
the military and the seals,
I see this all time.

1524
01:41:26,590 --> 01:41:28,120
Everyone thinks that the
military in the seals,

1525
01:41:28,121 --> 01:41:31,930
I think that we're leading
terminator robots, right?

1526
01:41:32,380 --> 01:41:34,810
And everyone is just driven and
they're going to get up and going to do

1527
01:41:34,811 --> 01:41:37,570
everything. And it's, I just talked
about this on the last podcast.

1528
01:41:37,630 --> 01:41:38,740
It is a bell curve.

1529
01:41:39,420 --> 01:41:42,970
It is a bell curve and there's a great
bunch of guys at the top of the bell

1530
01:41:42,971 --> 01:41:44,110
curve that are go getters.

1531
01:41:44,260 --> 01:41:46,690
There's a solid bunch of
guys in the middle and then
there's the lower guys that

1532
01:41:46,691 --> 01:41:47,524
are bumps.

1533
01:41:47,980 --> 01:41:52,900
And so this interpretation that the
concepts that I talk about are just for

1534
01:41:52,901 --> 01:41:55,540
leading these front,

1535
01:41:55,541 --> 01:41:59,860
running a personalities that
just make everything happen.

1536
01:41:59,990 --> 01:42:02,110
N Not correct.

1537
01:42:02,530 --> 01:42:05,080
You know there are seals
that don't want to work.

1538
01:42:05,110 --> 01:42:07,390
There are seals that
want to take shortcuts.

1539
01:42:07,570 --> 01:42:10,210
There are seals that want to skate by.
Then you get outside,

1540
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:14,260
then you're working with Iraqi soldiers
that are unmotivated, untrained,

1541
01:42:14,470 --> 01:42:17,950
poorly equipped. We got to work
with these guys. We got bosses.

1542
01:42:18,190 --> 01:42:23,190
I mean I got bosses in the seal teams
that are either an egomaniac or that are

1543
01:42:23,350 --> 01:42:26,740
old term risk averse.
You could have any of this stuff going on.

1544
01:42:26,860 --> 01:42:29,320
You can have your guys
that are risk averse.

1545
01:42:29,321 --> 01:42:33,700
You can have guys that are too crazy.
You got all, you know what they are.

1546
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:37,750
They're humans, they're
individuals. They're human beings.

1547
01:42:38,020 --> 01:42:42,710
And because they're human beings, even in
special operations and sometimes it is,

1548
01:42:42,711 --> 01:42:45,490
especially in in special operations cause
when you get in special operations you

1549
01:42:45,491 --> 01:42:49,450
get guys that have huge
egos and attitudes and so,

1550
01:42:49,630 --> 01:42:52,570
oh you think that they just want to
do whatever you tell them to do. No,

1551
01:42:52,571 --> 01:42:55,390
they got their own idea. They got to go
their own method. They got their own plan,

1552
01:42:55,391 --> 01:42:58,150
they got their own, what they
think they are. Tactical genius.

1553
01:42:58,151 --> 01:43:02,350
So you got to get around that.
So what does it mean?

1554
01:43:02,650 --> 01:43:07,650
It means you have to lead them and it's
the common theme that I'm talking about

1555
01:43:07,991 --> 01:43:10,330
all the time and it was,
I mean you got to build relationships,

1556
01:43:10,390 --> 01:43:11,470
you got to build the trust,

1557
01:43:11,471 --> 01:43:13,750
you've got to make sure they understand
why they're doing what they're doing.

1558
01:43:13,930 --> 01:43:16,210
You've got to make sure they
understand the strategic and back.

1559
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:20,800
You got to empower them. You got to set a
good example. You got to listen to them,

1560
01:43:20,890 --> 01:43:23,780
you got to take input, you got
to give them responsibility. And,

1561
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:26,740
and when I say responsibility,
I mean real responsibility.

1562
01:43:28,070 --> 01:43:30,790
You've got to build them up.
You've got to make them better.

1563
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:34,480
You got to show them and let them see.

1564
01:43:35,320 --> 01:43:39,970
Not In a, not in a, in your face way,

1565
01:43:40,210 --> 01:43:45,210
but you've got to subtly let them see
what self improvement means them and how

1566
01:43:45,851 --> 01:43:49,000
they can better their position
and what drive we'll get them.

1567
01:43:50,470 --> 01:43:52,460
He got to them ownership of stuff.

1568
01:43:53,450 --> 01:43:57,740
And you got to let that ownership grow
into extreme ownership where they really

1569
01:43:57,741 --> 01:44:01,220
want to own things and you got to teach
them to lead and you got to put them in

1570
01:44:01,221 --> 01:44:05,810
leadership positions and you gotta show
your trust by actually following them

1571
01:44:05,811 --> 01:44:10,790
sometimes and again, people
ask me these questions.

1572
01:44:10,820 --> 01:44:14,360
You know how I'm a new leader?
How do I lead? I got a new person.

1573
01:44:14,361 --> 01:44:17,810
How do I lead them? It's the same answers.
It's the same answers all the time.

1574
01:44:17,811 --> 01:44:21,410
That principles of leadership
now the nuances are there. Yes,

1575
01:44:21,411 --> 01:44:22,790
the nuances are there and I,

1576
01:44:22,791 --> 01:44:26,390
I have to nuance for echo that I got a
nuance for this guy over here and I got a

1577
01:44:26,391 --> 01:44:29,480
nuance for this group over here.
The the nuances are there,

1578
01:44:29,690 --> 01:44:32,690
but the basic principles are the
same. Am I never, am I going to?

1579
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:34,340
Who am I going to be in charge of that?

1580
01:44:34,341 --> 01:44:36,260
I'm not going to try and build a
relationship of trust with them.

1581
01:44:36,830 --> 01:44:40,640
Who's that dancers? Nobody. You know?
Who is it that I don't want to set?

1582
01:44:40,641 --> 01:44:42,530
A good example for the answer is nobody.

1583
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:46,700
Who is it that I'm not going to listen to?
If you don't listen to people,

1584
01:44:46,701 --> 01:44:49,150
you alienate them and you don't want
to be part of the team. I mean it's,

1585
01:44:49,210 --> 01:44:53,510
it's the things are universal
and again,

1586
01:44:53,511 --> 01:44:57,920
there's nuances because you might have to
make adaptations. And you know, when we,

1587
01:44:57,980 --> 01:45:01,400
when we did battle leadership
with, uh, with, uh,

1588
01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:05,060
eight off von Shell and he talks about
distinctly these three different types of

1589
01:45:05,061 --> 01:45:09,860
commanders and how the boss gave them
each their own little adjusted order

1590
01:45:10,190 --> 01:45:13,190
because he was dealing with
their personalities. So yes,

1591
01:45:13,191 --> 01:45:14,420
you've got to deal with the personalities,

1592
01:45:14,421 --> 01:45:17,710
but that doesn't mean you're doing
something different from the principals.

1593
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:20,673
So

1594
01:45:22,070 --> 01:45:25,080
when you get, sure, when you get to
the bottom of the bell curve, it,

1595
01:45:25,100 --> 01:45:29,990
you might see some people that
might need to be replaced,

1596
01:45:29,991 --> 01:45:32,360
they might need to be removed,
but I'll tell you what,

1597
01:45:32,990 --> 01:45:36,650
most likely they just need to be led.

1598
01:45:36,930 --> 01:45:37,763
Mm.

1599
01:45:40,660 --> 01:45:43,680
The reason that our,
I think one of the reasons why it,

1600
01:45:43,810 --> 01:45:47,920
the perception is that all your
guys are robots and you know,

1601
01:45:48,370 --> 01:45:49,780
I'm going to give you an order.
They follow it.

1602
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:52,570
No questions that is is like movies,
right?

1603
01:45:52,840 --> 01:45:55,120
Like a few good men membered
Jack Nicholson. He's like,

1604
01:45:56,140 --> 01:45:59,830
people will follow orders or people
die. Yeah. That was his thing.

1605
01:45:59,940 --> 01:46:02,830
And they say that kind of
stuff. Yeah. And but they do,

1606
01:46:02,831 --> 01:46:07,270
they do capture in some Hollywood movies
where they show how mute knees take

1607
01:46:07,271 --> 01:46:10,540
place and how things go
wrong and how, you know, the,

1608
01:46:10,750 --> 01:46:14,380
the new lieutenant Vietnam is going
to get fragged by his own people.

1609
01:46:14,620 --> 01:46:17,350
That stuff's real. Yeah.
You know, that stuff's real.

1610
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:21,930
So it's just, it, it's a
misperception. The other thing,

1611
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:25,930
the other misperception is because of
bootcamp, a lot of military movies are,

1612
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:30,070
they show up, they show a significant
amount of time in bootcamp,

1613
01:46:30,280 --> 01:46:34,300
but bootcamp is a matter of
weeks in a career. You know,

1614
01:46:34,301 --> 01:46:38,800
I think Marine Corps bootcamp is 13 weeks.
I think the army bootcamp is 10 weeks.

1615
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:43,840
Bootcamp is a very short period of time
in your four year, six year, eight year,

1616
01:46:43,841 --> 01:46:47,170
10 year, 20 year career
bootcamp is, you know,

1617
01:46:47,171 --> 01:46:49,950
I talked about the indoctrinational
times in the military.

1618
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:53,190
They are very short periods of
time compared to your whole career.

1619
01:46:53,940 --> 01:46:57,010
And in bootcamp when you're Joan
instructor says dropdown and do pushups,

1620
01:46:57,030 --> 01:47:00,450
you dropped down a few pushups in boot
bootcamp when you're Joan instructor says

1621
01:47:00,451 --> 01:47:04,020
pickup that, you know, make your
bed, you make your bed when these,

1622
01:47:04,021 --> 01:47:04,741
and if you don't,

1623
01:47:04,741 --> 01:47:07,200
they yell at you and they yell at
you until you do make your bed.

1624
01:47:07,410 --> 01:47:11,940
So people get that idea that that's
the way the military is run. Yeah. Yup.

1625
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:15,420
And that is like, you know, a great
example is full metal jacket, the movie,

1626
01:47:15,450 --> 01:47:16,620
which is a great movie,

1627
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:21,090
but the boot camp scene is half the movie.

1628
01:47:21,930 --> 01:47:25,710
But in reality, even if you are
a guy in, in Vietnam, you know,

1629
01:47:25,711 --> 01:47:29,100
boot campus 13 weeks and then you
went onto, into Vietnam for a year.

1630
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:32,880
So it's a fraction of what
your real career is like.

1631
01:47:33,180 --> 01:47:37,020
And so people get that impression that
you're just going to be able to bark

1632
01:47:37,021 --> 01:47:40,170
orders and everyone's gonna listen to
you. It just doesn't work that way. Yeah.

1633
01:47:40,530 --> 01:47:44,700
And there's actually, there's a
great, there's a great video. Um,

1634
01:47:45,030 --> 01:47:49,680
it's called Charlie
Company and V, uh, anyways,

1635
01:47:49,710 --> 01:47:52,650
I forget the name of the video,
but it's about a company in Vietnam,

1636
01:47:52,651 --> 01:47:57,000
Charlie Company. And maybe if you
remind me, I'll put it on the,

1637
01:47:57,060 --> 01:48:01,410
on the website. Um, it shows
two company commanders.

1638
01:48:01,830 --> 01:48:04,680
But anyways, to make a long
story short, these guys,

1639
01:48:05,310 --> 01:48:07,470
they don't like their
new company commander.

1640
01:48:08,340 --> 01:48:12,600
And at first they're resistant to
him and you know, he says, listen,

1641
01:48:12,601 --> 01:48:14,790
these guys could got to learn that there's
going to have to do. And I tell him,

1642
01:48:15,990 --> 01:48:20,990
and then it fast forwards a couple months
and they interview him again and he

1643
01:48:21,421 --> 01:48:22,980
goes, hey, you know, how's
everything going? He goes, you know,

1644
01:48:22,981 --> 01:48:26,010
they get it now and they realize that
they just had to listen to me and do what

1645
01:48:26,011 --> 01:48:26,790
I told them.

1646
01:48:26,790 --> 01:48:30,810
And then they go out in the field with
the guys and the guys in the fueled,

1647
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:35,670
they're supposed to be doing things and
they're just not doing it. They're just,

1648
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:38,790
they're literally calling back like, yeah,
where did we did, yeah, we did a patrol,

1649
01:48:38,930 --> 01:48:42,210
you know, they didn't do it.
Yeah, we moved positions.
They didn't move positions.

1650
01:48:42,360 --> 01:48:45,780
Yeah, we're gonna do another, you
know, another foot patrol tonight.

1651
01:48:45,930 --> 01:48:46,770
They're not doing it.

1652
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:50,550
So he was under the impression that
everyone had like buckled to his will.

1653
01:48:51,090 --> 01:48:54,060
They were just completely
snowing him and he had no idea.

1654
01:48:54,870 --> 01:48:56,880
So that's what happens in the military.

1655
01:48:57,060 --> 01:49:01,650
If you're don't lead your people and
you just order them around and you think

1656
01:49:01,651 --> 01:49:05,820
that everyone's just this, this, uh,
this, uh, how would they describe it here?

1657
01:49:06,900 --> 01:49:11,070
Men who are mostly driven or leaders who
have a desire to make themselves better.

1658
01:49:11,071 --> 01:49:14,610
I mean, if anybody in a
position with guys like that,

1659
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:17,310
it's going to the leadership job,
it's going to be very easy.

1660
01:49:17,311 --> 01:49:20,580
You just tell him what to
do and they do it. I mean,

1661
01:49:20,581 --> 01:49:24,870
I could give you example upon example
upon example of stuff in the seal teams

1662
01:49:24,871 --> 01:49:28,920
were what I had to do to get people
convinced that this was the right thing to

1663
01:49:28,921 --> 01:49:33,780
deal. You know, I mean, it
is like, you know, a classic
example is telling guys, okay,

1664
01:49:33,781 --> 01:49:37,680
we're going take Iraqi soldiers
on every operation. You know.

1665
01:49:37,681 --> 01:49:41,850
So these guys were saying, are you kidding
me? Well, they just didn't go, hey,

1666
01:49:41,851 --> 01:49:44,010
cool Jocko. We'll do exactly
what you tell us. No, they look,

1667
01:49:44,250 --> 01:49:46,920
what are you talking about raw taking
these guys out, why would we do that?

1668
01:49:46,921 --> 01:49:48,780
It's going to be risky. These guys
aren't trustworthy. They don't,

1669
01:49:48,790 --> 01:49:52,090
they're not trained. Right. They had
a million reasons why not to do that.

1670
01:49:54,730 --> 01:49:56,470
But how do you get them to do it?

1671
01:49:56,530 --> 01:50:00,610
You explain to them why you explained
to them the strategic importance.

1672
01:50:00,940 --> 01:50:02,650
You have built trust with them.

1673
01:50:02,740 --> 01:50:05,350
You tell them that they're going
to take ownership of the Iraqis.

1674
01:50:05,351 --> 01:50:07,510
I mean it's everything that I just said.
That's what you do.

1675
01:50:07,511 --> 01:50:11,890
That's a classic example.
So yes,

1676
01:50:11,891 --> 01:50:15,280
once again, you have, if you're
in a leadership position,

1677
01:50:16,450 --> 01:50:17,410
you have to lead.

1678
01:50:19,750 --> 01:50:22,540
You ever seen the movie saving
Private Ryan? Yes. Yeah.

1679
01:50:22,541 --> 01:50:27,220
There was a part in then and
that movie that um, that they,

1680
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:29,550
they weren't down for the orders.
I remember that one.

1681
01:50:29,551 --> 01:50:32,630
It was kind of like a little pivotal
part where they were going to go take a,

1682
01:50:32,631 --> 01:50:35,950
a machine gun nests and they were
like, man, we don't have to do this.

1683
01:50:35,951 --> 01:50:37,930
So they all kind of got together
and said, hey, you know,

1684
01:50:38,490 --> 01:50:41,530
seems like unnecessary risks.
And he's like,

1685
01:50:41,590 --> 01:50:44,800
he kind of tripped out a little bit and
kind of forced them to do it and they

1686
01:50:44,801 --> 01:50:45,910
were like, all right, whatever.

1687
01:50:45,911 --> 01:50:48,640
Kind of reluctantly then one of the
guys died and stuff. But anyway,

1688
01:50:48,790 --> 01:50:50,910
that's an example of where they,
yeah.

1689
01:50:51,150 --> 01:50:52,230
And, and especially, you know,

1690
01:50:52,350 --> 01:50:54,840
when you were just doing a
talking about world war one,

1691
01:50:56,250 --> 01:50:58,170
that one portion of the book
where he says, you know what,

1692
01:50:58,171 --> 01:51:00,930
we got ordered to do this thing. I didn't
feel good about it, but it was an order,

1693
01:51:00,931 --> 01:51:05,040
we're going to do it. So there's
examples from the past, especially where,

1694
01:51:05,130 --> 01:51:08,250
you know, it's definitely was more
like that in the past and more one,

1695
01:51:08,251 --> 01:51:11,520
obviously it was like that obviously it
was like that unfortunately it was like

1696
01:51:11,521 --> 01:51:15,680
that. Yeah. Because it caused
people to continue, you know,

1697
01:51:15,750 --> 01:51:20,750
to execute these operations that
we're just going to get people killed.

1698
01:51:21,720 --> 01:51:24,180
And you know, actually Lafe and I
were talking about that last week.

1699
01:51:24,540 --> 01:51:27,960
Pickett's charge tickets,
charge Gettysburg,

1700
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:33,500
they sent the troops up and
they got slaughtered and
they know they're survivors

1701
01:51:33,931 --> 01:51:38,280
came back in. Uh, Lee was, you
know, basically in tears like, Hey,

1702
01:51:38,281 --> 01:51:42,090
I'm sorry this happened.
I, this was my fault.

1703
01:51:42,210 --> 01:51:46,290
He took ownership of it and I hope
I'm getting the story right. Um,

1704
01:51:46,710 --> 01:51:51,400
but, but that's the,
that's the general, uh,

1705
01:51:52,300 --> 01:51:55,090
the general gist of the story.
But then they eat, you know,

1706
01:51:55,091 --> 01:51:59,710
the big story was that the guys were like,
hey, we'll go again if you, you know,

1707
01:51:59,711 --> 01:52:04,160
cause you're such a great leader
will go again. And Life, you know,

1708
01:52:04,161 --> 01:52:06,850
it was kind of like, you know, that's
what world war, you know, that's what,

1709
01:52:07,300 --> 01:52:11,590
that's what happened, that that shows you
that guys were willing. And I said, yeah,

1710
01:52:11,591 --> 01:52:14,320
but the differences in world war one,
they sent them again,

1711
01:52:14,890 --> 01:52:18,670
they sent them over and over. You
know, Lee was regretting and I'm sorry,

1712
01:52:18,671 --> 01:52:20,950
and I did something that got you got,
you know, a bunch of guys killed.

1713
01:52:20,951 --> 01:52:25,660
It's horrible in World War One. And like,
yeah, it happened going again. Oh yeah.

1714
01:52:25,661 --> 01:52:28,960
And that happens again. We're doing it
again and again and again and it's just,

1715
01:52:28,961 --> 01:52:32,440
uh, I'll, I'll, I'll,

1716
01:52:32,860 --> 01:52:36,670
I'll always just be horrified
by that and hopefully, um,

1717
01:52:36,850 --> 01:52:40,060
man progress's beyond that.
And again,

1718
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:45,280
part of that is as a person
you have to question,

1719
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:47,450
you have to be a rebel.

1720
01:52:47,810 --> 01:52:51,320
You have to question what people are
telling you and why they're telling it to

1721
01:52:51,321 --> 01:52:55,700
you. If my boss doesn't tell
me why I'm doing my operation,

1722
01:52:56,420 --> 01:52:59,030
it's and I continue to execute it,
that's my fault.

1723
01:52:59,120 --> 01:53:02,090
I need to raise my hand and say, boss,
what are we doing? Why are we doing this?

1724
01:53:02,120 --> 01:53:03,020
I don't understand.

1725
01:53:03,500 --> 01:53:08,120
You got to take that initiative because
if you're just blindly following orders,

1726
01:53:08,121 --> 01:53:11,000
I don't want somebody that's
blindly following orders.

1727
01:53:11,150 --> 01:53:15,830
I never want people that blindly follow
my orders. I want people that say, oh,

1728
01:53:15,831 --> 01:53:19,850
get boss, wait, why are we doing this? Why
is this happening? Because I want people,

1729
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:22,640
I want think, I want leaders
underneath me that know how to lead.

1730
01:53:24,230 --> 01:53:24,861
And you know what?

1731
01:53:24,861 --> 01:53:29,300
When you build the trust and
you build the relationships,

1732
01:53:29,330 --> 01:53:33,650
those guys will do anything for you and
my guys and my task. They do anything.

1733
01:53:33,651 --> 01:53:34,670
I mean,
I know it,

1734
01:53:34,850 --> 01:53:39,850
they did over and over again did
operations that were crazy and hard and

1735
01:53:42,171 --> 01:53:46,820
dangerous and risky. Never
did anyone say, oh, you know,

1736
01:53:47,150 --> 01:53:50,750
we're not doing this. They said, okay,
we understand what, what's the mission?

1737
01:53:50,840 --> 01:53:55,100
All right.
So you got to build that road.

1738
01:53:55,130 --> 01:53:59,120
It's against the same basic principles
of leading human beings. Yeah.

1739
01:53:59,450 --> 01:54:00,470
And that's what you gotta do.

1740
01:54:00,471 --> 01:54:03,620
But to think that you're just going to
order people to do things not happening.

1741
01:54:04,010 --> 01:54:08,930
Mm. Long answer to a, to a good question.

1742
01:54:08,931 --> 01:54:10,670
That was actually interesting perspective.

1743
01:54:10,671 --> 01:54:14,450
And I know it's a perspective that a
lot of people have. People always think,

1744
01:54:14,451 --> 01:54:17,990
well, you know, you led seals and they
really, yeah. So that was easy. Yeah.

1745
01:54:18,020 --> 01:54:22,940
But before you said, before you told
me, that's Kinda what I figured. Yeah.

1746
01:54:24,920 --> 01:54:25,753
Last question.

1747
01:54:29,010 --> 01:54:34,010
Jacko any tips for Breaking Habits
of Laziness and procrastination?

1748
01:54:35,100 --> 01:54:37,020
Maybe some good reads on the subject.

1749
01:54:37,050 --> 01:54:42,030
And this is a question I wish you'd
answered for me like 10 years ago. So,

1750
01:54:42,031 --> 01:54:45,850
yeah. Any tips? You know,

1751
01:54:47,110 --> 01:54:52,110
this is definitely been a pretty common
question when people want to know how to

1752
01:54:53,591 --> 01:54:58,570
stop the laziness and they want to know
how to stop the procrastination and

1753
01:55:00,190 --> 01:55:04,420
they have some idea in their
head, you know, some kind of a,

1754
01:55:05,250 --> 01:55:08,160
a vision for what they want to do,

1755
01:55:10,360 --> 01:55:13,090
but they don't know where to start. They
don't know where to start it, you know,

1756
01:55:13,270 --> 01:55:17,200
they don't know where to
start. And so they say, hey,

1757
01:55:18,520 --> 01:55:21,190
where do I start and,
and when's the best time to start?

1758
01:55:21,460 --> 01:55:23,470
And I have a very simple answer for that.

1759
01:55:25,620 --> 01:55:25,840
Okay,

1760
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:28,060
here and now.

1761
01:55:30,950 --> 01:55:35,360
That's it. You want to improve,
you want to get better.

1762
01:55:36,110 --> 01:55:39,650
You want to get on a workout
program or a clean diet.

1763
01:55:39,770 --> 01:55:44,010
You want to start a business,
you want

1764
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:48,510
to write a book or make a movie or build
a house or a computer or put together

1765
01:55:48,511 --> 01:55:51,090
some mobile application.

1766
01:55:53,780 --> 01:55:54,613
Where do you start?

1767
01:55:57,990 --> 01:56:01,650
You start right here and when do
you start? You start right now.

1768
01:56:03,750 --> 01:56:06,860
You initiate the action aggressively.
You

1769
01:56:06,950 --> 01:56:07,783
go

1770
01:56:09,690 --> 01:56:14,690
because the idea isn't going to execute
itself and the book isn't going to write

1771
01:56:14,821 --> 01:56:19,260
itself and the weights out in the gym,
they're not going to move themselves.

1772
01:56:19,320 --> 01:56:22,860
You have to do it and
you have to do it now.

1773
01:56:25,430 --> 01:56:30,430
And that means you got to stop thinking
about it and stopped dreaming about it

1774
01:56:30,590 --> 01:56:35,540
and stop researching every aspect of it
and reading all about it and debating

1775
01:56:35,541 --> 01:56:39,110
the pros and cons of it.
Just start doing it.

1776
01:56:42,410 --> 01:56:46,870
Take that first step
and make it happen.

1777
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:49,550
Get after it,

1778
01:56:50,150 --> 01:56:54,320
get after it here and now.

1779
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:09,310
And I think, uh, I think that's
all we've got for tonight.

1780
01:57:11,860 --> 01:57:12,693
