CARLA HAYDEN: Oh, it's on.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:07:09.039
Hello.

00:07:09.039 --> 00:08:06.000
Hi.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.080
I'm Carla Hayden with the Library of Congress
and it's great to see all of you and we're

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:16.360
almost ready to start so we thought we'd get
some warm up stuff going and this young lady

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:20.900
is going to do some stuff.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.529
[pause]

00:08:23.529 --> 00:08:31.419
SASHA: Hello Hello.

00:08:31.419 --> 00:08:32.810
My name is Sasha.

00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:33.990
I'm with the Young Readers Center.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:36.940
We're downstairs and if you haven't been there,
come visit us.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:41.330
LADY IN RED: I'm also at the Young Readers
Center.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:45.200
SASHA: Yeah, so we're going to sing a song
about the Young Readers Center.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.250
Do you guys know what an abbreviation is?

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:49.280
Ok.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.149
So YRC stands for?

00:08:51.149 --> 00:08:53.010
Yeah, there you go.

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:58.841
So we're going to sing a song about it and
it's really fun and we want to make sure that

00:08:58.841 --> 00:09:01.250
the adults participate too, right?

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:02.250
Right?

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.250
Ok, awesome.

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:06.290
So, maybe you can do the hands and we'll do
the songs together.

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:09.680
LADY IN RED: Try to get this motion going.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.680
Yeah, perfect.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.330
SASHA: And at the end we need you to be really
really loud.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.440
I'm sorry you have to be loud at the end.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.560
Ok, here we go.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.029
It goes like this.

00:09:19.029 --> 00:09:26.389
[Singing]: 1-2-3 we're at the YRC. 1-2-3 we're
at the YRC.

00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:34.269
If you want to read a book, come on in and
take a look.1-2-3 we're at the YRC.

00:09:34.269 --> 00:09:36.110
In 5-4-3-2-1.

Storytime!
[applause]

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:52.180
SASHA: It's kind of a story time so let's
do one about who hear likes to travel into

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:53.180
space?

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:54.180
1 or 2.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:55.180
Yeah yeah.

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:56.180
Ok ok.

00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:01.150
So we'll do the same song, but we're going
to go "zoom zoom we're going to the moon."

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:02.150
Are you ready?

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.150
You guys can participate?

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:04.150
Ok.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:05.680
I know you guys can sing.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:06.680
Let's do it.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:07.680
Ok, here we go.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.940
[Singing]: Zoom zoom zoom we're going to the
moon.

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:14.290
Zoom zoom zoom we're going to the moon.

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:18.570
If you want to take a trip, come on up in
the rocket ship.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.970
Zoom zoom zoom we're going to the moon.

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:24.060
In 5-4-3-2-1.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:28.240
Blast off!

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.890
Ok, that's a little bit better.

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:35.550
And then what's the other one we have?

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:38.710
We're going to the stars.

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:46.990
Ok, maybe we'll go... no, what rhymes with
stars?

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:48.100
AUDIENCE: Mars!

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.210
SASHA: Mars?

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:50.800
You guys are so smart.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:55.330
You've been to space a lot of times.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:11:05.660
AUDIENCE: [ inaudible]
SASHA: How can we make a lot of noise?

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:14.620
CARLA: You don't get to make a noise much
in the library, so we have this big room and

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:19.350
we're not going to disturb anybody, so wouldn't
it be cool to make a lot of noise in the library?

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:20.650
SASHA: It's fun to make a lot of noise.

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:25.400
So, maybe we'll start with the schools that
are here.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.010
Yeah.

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:28.590
What school are you guys from?

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:30.151
AUDIENCE: Capitol Hill Day School!

00:11:30.151 --> 00:11:33.200
SASHA: Capitol Hill Day School and what do
we have over here?

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:38.740
AUDIENCE: Capitol Hill Montessori at Logan!

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.590
SASHA: Ok.

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:43.530
So, who's the loudest school right now?

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:46.230
CARLA: There you go.

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:48.260
AUDIENCE: We are!

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:59.060
CARLA: Ok, let me close the door first
SASHA: There's a little bit of a competition.

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:02.530
[pause]
SASHA: We're going to see who is louder.

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:05.520
Are you guys ready?

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:14.070
Ok, we have two people on each side, so we
are going to be able to tell who is blowing

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:15.350
our ear off stronger.

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:22.730
CARLA: You ladies, be the judges because they're
right in the middle.

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:27.700
You have a scale from 1 to 5 and so you make
the decision.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:28.700
Ok.

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:32.830
LADY IN RED: So first we're going to see which
school can clap the loudest.

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:33.830
Ok?

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:37.530
So, let's start with this one.

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:40.990
On a count of three we're going to see which
school can clap the loudest, so we'll have

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:43.400
you guys go first.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.470
So, 1-2-3.

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:52.730
[clapping]
LADY IN RED: That's pretty good.

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:53.770
Yeah.

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:55.610
I like that.

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:57.140
You guys up for the challenge?

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.060
AUDIENCE: Yeah!

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:05.780
SASHA: Ok, on the count of 3-2-1.

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:13.460
[clapping]
LADY IN RED: That is pretty close.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.460
Judges?

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:18.820
SASHA: So who thinks Capitol Hill Day School
was louder?

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.180
AUDIENCE: Yeah!

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:21.550
SASHA: Yeah?

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.580
And who things the Montessori school was louder?

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:24.740
Ooh, one.

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:29.190
I think this was a win this time around to
you guys at Capitol Hill Day School.

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:32.120
So, how about who can stomp louder?

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:37.050
AUDIENCE: [ inaudible]
LADY IN RED: So, on a count of three, stomp

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:38.490
on this side.

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:39.490
1-2-3.

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:43.520
[stomping]
SASHA: It sounds like a stampede.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:46.260
And stop!

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:52.500
SASHA: Are you guys ready?

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.990
Ok, come back with some stomps.

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:57.700
Let's go.

00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:58.700
[stomping]

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:03.120
Some people are getting up, you're getting
into this.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.850
All right all right.

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:08.810
Judges, who thinks Montessori was winning
out?

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:11.200
LADY IN RED: Oh, it's so close.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.280
SASHA: Capitol Hill Day School winning out?

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.280
No?

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.270
Oh, we have a championship at the Montessori
School.

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:18.590
You guys are great.

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:19.590
AUDIENCE: Yeah!

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:20.900
SASHA: You guys are great.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:21.900
Thank you.

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:28.300
CARLA: Thank you ladies, thank you because
all of that noise brought in our friends that

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.080
have been trying to get here.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:32.140
Hello, glad you're here.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:38.140
You could see we were making a little noise
in the library, and having fun and we hope

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:45.550
that all of you will have some more fun in
just a few minutes because we want to welcome

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:47.540
all of you to the Library of Congress.

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:50.840
And how many of you have been here before?

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.030
Good group, good group.

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:58.890
How many of you have ever stomped and made
that much noise in any library?

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:02.920
AUDIENCE: [inaudible]
CARLA: Okay.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:03.920
Right.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:07.430
All right, it could happen.

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:14.290
We have a number of schools that are here
with us, online, and we have a great list

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:18.530
of schools and they're from all over the country.

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:25.040
Plus, we have public schools and schools right
here in Washington DC that are looking at

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.230
us and gonna be listening online.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:30.680
Could you wave at everybody?

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.000
Hey!

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.150
North Carolina, South Carolina, all of the
schools that are here and we're gonna give

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:42.210
'em a good shout out real soon and just say
their names.

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:46.910
So, I'm the Librarian of Congress, and as
you can tell, I'm a little excited about our

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:51.400
program today because we have a very, very
special guest.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:56.750
Many of you have met him and you notice he
has a medal around his neck.

00:15:56.750 --> 00:16:04.100
A gold medal, because he is the Librarian
of Congress' youth ambassador for young people's

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:05.100
literature.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:09.170
And that's very similar to being an Olympic
medal winner.

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:17.540
He won something that's called the McArthur
Genius Award, which is really like- I know!

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.460
Yes, yes.

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:28.950
Now, can anybody- And I know some of you have
read his graphic books, tell me his name?

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:34.750
AUDIENCE MEMBER: [inaudible]
CARLA: Yes, say it loud.

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:40.520
AUDIENCE MEMBER: [inaudible]
CARLA: louder!

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:45.140
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Gene Yang.

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.449
CARLA: Yay!

00:16:47.449 --> 00:16:49.279
And there he is.

00:16:49.279 --> 00:16:53.550
As you know, he's gotten lots of awards, as
I just mentioned.

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:57.500
He's even had a chance to draw Superman.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:02.040
And, if you don't know his story, he started
drawing

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.279
comic books when he was right around your
age.

00:17:05.279 --> 00:17:12.351
And he has traveled around the country,
talking about books and reading, and reading

00:17:12.351 --> 00:17:13.690
without walls.

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:18.339
And he wants everyone, and that's
what we're gonna talk about today, to read

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:20.980
a book that you normally wouldn't read.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.799
How many
of you have read something, not just for school,

00:17:23.799 --> 00:17:25.789
but a book that you look at it and you say,
"I

00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:29.110
don't know if I really want to read this"?

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:31.710
Ooh, quite a few.

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:34.070
Well, we're gonna take the challenge.

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:37.929
So, I want to thank, though, some people for
making this possible.

00:17:37.929 --> 00:17:42.299
I had to write it down to make
sure I didn't forget.

00:17:42.299 --> 00:17:46.880
It's the Children's Book Council and Every
Child A Reader Foundation, for

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.050
their support of us being here.

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:52.750
Also, McMillan 1st, 2nd publishing for their
help.

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:57.080
So, now, I'm
gonna bring up our award winning ambassador,

00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:00.809
Gene Yang.
[applause]

00:18:00.809 --> 00:18:05.789
GENE: Hi, thank you.

00:18:05.789 --> 00:18:08.279
Thank you.

00:18:08.279 --> 00:18:09.601
Thank you Dr. Hayden.

00:18:09.601 --> 00:18:10.601
Good morning!

00:18:10.601 --> 00:18:11.601
AUDIENCE: Good morning!

00:18:11.601 --> 00:18:12.601
GENE: Thank you all for being here.

00:18:12.601 --> 00:18:14.789
It's such a thrill to be in this room with
all these people who

00:18:14.789 --> 00:18:15.789
love books.

00:18:15.789 --> 00:18:19.539
This is like one of my favorite kinds of settings.

00:18:19.539 --> 00:18:26.010
Well, so, the way we're gonna start this morning
off is, Dr. Hayden and I are gonna ask each

00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:28.240
other questions, mostly about books.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:33.539
Then towards the end, we'd like to get some
questions from you.

00:18:33.539 --> 00:18:36.840
If questions pop up in your head in the beginning,
save those questions.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:41.499
File them away in the back of your head, and
at the end we want to hear those questions.

00:18:41.499 --> 00:18:47.080
What I'd like to first hear about is how you
fell in love with books.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:56.210
CARLA: Well, I had the wonderful experience
of having people around me who loved to read

00:18:56.210 --> 00:19:00.190
and one of the first things they would do
when I would go and visit my grandparents

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:03.389
in the summer and things, is they would read
to me.

00:19:03.389 --> 00:19:09.460
The first thing I wanted to do though, was
learn how to read my own stuff.

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:14.899
It was nice being read to, I loved it, but
I couldn't wait to start reading myself, so

00:19:14.899 --> 00:19:18.771
I could get into it and read whatever I wanted
to.

00:19:18.771 --> 00:19:19.771
I liked crime books.

00:19:19.771 --> 00:19:22.289
GENE: You liked crime books?

00:19:22.289 --> 00:19:24.909
Like, books about people doing bad things?

00:19:24.909 --> 00:19:26.110
CARLA: Yeah.

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:28.429
So, I found this book.

00:19:28.429 --> 00:19:34.350
My grandmother, nice little lady and everything,
but she kind of liked mysteries and things

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:35.350
like that.

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:39.539
So, she had this book that I knew I wasn't
supposed to look at.

00:19:39.539 --> 00:19:42.590
It was called "Hollywood Babylon."

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:45.390
How many of you all know what Babylon is?

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:50.770
It was a wild place back in the ancient days.

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:53.679
And Hollywood, you know where that is.

00:19:53.679 --> 00:19:56.559
It was a true crime thing, right?

00:19:56.559 --> 00:19:59.190
With all these gruesome pictures.

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:03.890
Fatty Arbuckle, just murders and stuff.

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:07.940
And when I would come, you know, she'd make
sure she would put it away.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:12.399
And of course, I spent most of my summer finding
it.

00:20:12.399 --> 00:20:14.240
And that's how I got hooked.

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:18.590
At first, I could just look at the pictures
that were really, really gruesome.

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:20.799
And then I want to know what it said.

00:20:20.799 --> 00:20:22.159
GENE: That's what got you.

00:20:22.159 --> 00:20:23.159
True crime?

00:20:23.159 --> 00:20:24.159
CARLA: True crime.

00:20:24.159 --> 00:20:25.390
GENE: True crime was what got Dr. Hayden into
books.

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:26.580
CARLA: That's what got me going.

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:27.580
GENE: That's great.

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:28.580
That's great.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:30.619
For me, I grew up in a house of stories.

00:20:30.619 --> 00:20:31.769
My parents are both immigrants.

00:20:31.769 --> 00:20:34.119
My mom was born in mainland China.

00:20:34.119 --> 00:20:35.119
My dad in Taiwan.

00:20:35.119 --> 00:20:41.350
They both came to the United States for college
and met, fell in love, got married, had me.

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:43.480
I grew up listening to their stories.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.720
Both my mom and my dad loved to tell stories.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:49.549
I think this is actually true of a lot of
immigrant families.

00:20:49.549 --> 00:20:54.419
A lot of parents who are from another country,
or another culture, they'll want to tell their

00:20:54.419 --> 00:20:58.450
kids stories from that country, from that
culture, as a way of building that connection.

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:02.190
So, I heard lots of stories from Chinese culture
when I was a kid.

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:04.519
Reading, for me, was actually kind of hard.

00:21:04.519 --> 00:21:11.110
I remember in early elementary school, my
teachers would divide us into these two groups,

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:12.110
right?

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:13.610
And they would name 'em- I think they were
named after colors.

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:17.040
I think one of 'em was a red group, and one
of 'em was a blue group, but really they were

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.690
the fast and slow readers.

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:23.710
Everybody new; the colors weren't fooling
anybody, and I was definitely always on the

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:24.710
slow side.

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:29.119
At the very end of every month, our teacher
would make us line up by how many pages we'd

00:21:29.119 --> 00:21:32.289
read that month and I was always either last,
or second to last.

00:21:32.289 --> 00:21:36.710
It was me and my best friend, my best friend
would trade places.

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:44.110
Eventually, the way I kind of got through
that was my mom would sit down and read to

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:45.110
me.

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:46.110
She would read with me.

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:47.110
Even now though, I'm not a fast reader.

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:51.639
What I realized is- you don't have to read
fast in order to love books, right?

00:21:51.639 --> 00:21:52.639
CARLA: Right.

00:21:52.639 --> 00:21:53.639
GENE: You just have to read.

00:21:53.639 --> 00:21:55.179
It doesn't matter how quickly or slowly you
do it.

00:21:55.179 --> 00:21:56.640
You can still
enjoy the book.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.640
CARLA: Right.

00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:02.659
And sometimes, you want to read slow so you
can get what you want out of it, or everything

00:22:02.659 --> 00:22:03.659
like that.

00:22:03.659 --> 00:22:04.659
GENE: Yes.

00:22:04.659 --> 00:22:10.789
CARLA: It pains me sometimes to hear people
of your age group, and certainly in my age

00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:14.739
group, where it made reading not fun.

00:22:14.739 --> 00:22:15.739
GENE: Yeah.

00:22:15.739 --> 00:22:19.070
CARLA: That's what the cool thing about reading
is, it's fun.

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:23.869
But to have to go through all that, it takes
a little bit from it.

00:22:23.869 --> 00:22:27.230
GENE: Yeah, it does.

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:33.399
I think there are ways in which learning to
enjoy reading in the beginning can make it

00:22:33.399 --> 00:22:38.129
so that you can get through some things that
are more difficult to read later, right?

00:22:38.129 --> 00:22:41.750
You'll remember the fun, and that'll push
you through some of the harder stuff that

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:42.820
you'll have to read as you get older.

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:47.320
CARLA: That's why when people say, "We're
gonna read to babies and little kids and everything,"

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:51.529
that's to get them ready 'cause they know
there's something good if you figure out what

00:22:51.529 --> 00:22:53.419
all this text is.

00:22:53.419 --> 00:22:55.929
If you figure it out, you know there's a secret
in there.

00:22:55.929 --> 00:23:00.000
There's something that's really cool in there
and it gives you that.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000
GENE: Yeah.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.080
So you loved that True Crime book as a kid.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.080
Were there any other favorites?

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.080
CARLA: I still have it.

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:06.080
I kept that.

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.080
GENE: Were there any other favorites?

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.480
CARLA: Oh, Little Women.

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.889
I like that.

00:23:09.889 --> 00:23:15.760
Louisa May Alcott, and one that I brought
here today is my all time favorite when I

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.779
was a little girl, called Bright April.

00:23:18.779 --> 00:23:23.710
It was the first book that I learned about
and you see I have my Reading Without Walls

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:31.799
bookmark, so take that when you get- The first
one, the Walter Award too.

00:23:31.799 --> 00:23:36.649
The first book that I checked out over and
over and over, to the point that I had library

00:23:36.649 --> 00:23:42.519
fines and didn't even realize it because this
book was the first book that I saw myself

00:23:42.519 --> 00:23:43.529
in.

00:23:43.529 --> 00:23:49.720
It was a little girl who had pigtails, who
was a Brownie, and she was brown, just like

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:50.720
me.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:55.320
And I'm quite a bit older than you Gene.

00:23:55.320 --> 00:24:01.499
And when I was coming up, there weren't many
books that portrayed people that looked like

00:24:01.499 --> 00:24:02.499
me.

00:24:02.499 --> 00:24:05.789
Much less talked about my history or anything
like that.

00:24:05.789 --> 00:24:12.169
I just, to this day, I just love this book
because I could see myself in something that

00:24:12.169 --> 00:24:13.629
was important, like books.

00:24:13.629 --> 00:24:18.309
If books are important, but you don't see
yourself in 'em, what does that say?

00:24:18.309 --> 00:24:19.460
GENE: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:22.190
Yeah, I had a similar issue.

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:26.980
It was very hard when I was a kid, to find
characters who looked like me in the books

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:29.799
that I was reading and in the television shows
that I was watching.

00:24:29.799 --> 00:24:30.799
CARLA: Oh yeah.

00:24:30.799 --> 00:24:33.929
GENE: I wonder if that's why I drifted towards
superhero comics.

00:24:33.929 --> 00:24:37.389
I started reading superhero comics when I
was in 5th grade.

00:24:37.389 --> 00:24:42.320
The very first superhero comic that I bought
was an issue of Superman.

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:43.789
It was with Superman and the Atomic Knights.

00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:45.549
Y'all know who the Atomic Knights are?

00:24:45.549 --> 00:24:47.749
They're a little bit more obscure, but they're
these dudes-

00:24:47.749 --> 00:24:50.019
CARLA: There's a older gentleman.

00:24:50.019 --> 00:24:53.360
GENE: Yes, yes.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.789
The nerds have just outed themselves.

00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:55.789
CARLA: That's right.

00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:59.080
GENE: If you know who the Atomic Knights are,
you're definitely a nerd.

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:03.460
They're these dudes who dressed up in medieval
style armor and they ride around on these

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:04.899
giant, mutated dogs.

00:25:04.899 --> 00:25:05.899
CARLA: Ew.

00:25:05.899 --> 00:25:06.899
GENE: Yeah.

00:25:06.899 --> 00:25:07.899
It was kind of awesome.

00:25:07.899 --> 00:25:08.899
I gotta say it was kind of awesome.

00:25:08.899 --> 00:25:09.899
CARLA: Okay.

00:25:09.899 --> 00:25:14.429
GENE: I wonder if I drifted towards superheroes
because I had a hard time finding characters

00:25:14.429 --> 00:25:16.179
who look like me.

00:25:16.179 --> 00:25:21.460
Superheroes, people don't realize this, but
almost every major superhero out there; Superman,

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:24.529
Batman, Iron Man, the Hulk.

00:25:24.529 --> 00:25:26.299
They're all created by children of immigrants.

00:25:26.299 --> 00:25:32.149
They were all created by these sons of Jewish
immigrants from Europe.

00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:35.830
And I think that's why every superhero has
these two identities.

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:37.299
I had two identities when I was a kid.

00:25:37.299 --> 00:25:40.720
I had one name, a Chinese name that I used
at home.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.929
I had an English name that I used at school.

00:25:42.929 --> 00:25:45.200
I spoke one language at home, another one
at school.

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.210
It was almost like that.

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:49.539
It was like how Superman is both Superman
and Clark Kent.

00:25:49.539 --> 00:25:53.350
I don't even know if I was conscious of it
as a kid, but that definitely felt really

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:54.350
familiar to me.

00:25:54.350 --> 00:26:00.169
CARLA: That idea of two cultures and how you
speak and how you are at home, and how you

00:26:00.169 --> 00:26:04.320
are outside of the home is a common theme,
I think, with a lot of cultures.

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:06.080
GENE: Yeah, I think that's true.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:12.909
I think, I actually think that's one of the
best things about being an American, is that

00:26:12.909 --> 00:26:17.389
you can be an American without giving up that
core piece of yourself, you know?

00:26:17.389 --> 00:26:23.659
Because America is a collection of diverse
communities, and that's one of our strengths.

00:26:23.659 --> 00:26:28.109
CARLA: Someone once told me when we were talking
about having and being in this country where

00:26:28.109 --> 00:26:30.890
there's so many people looking all types of
ways.

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:38.779
Just this variety is, what if you only had
one type of ice cream flavor, and you could

00:26:38.779 --> 00:26:40.679
never have anything else?

00:26:40.679 --> 00:26:41.679
GENE: Yeah.

00:26:41.679 --> 00:26:42.720
CARLA: Think about that.

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:43.980
GENE: It would be terrible.

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.110
It would be a punishment.

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:49.330
CARLA: You may think it's good now to just
have chocolate, but it would be a punishment

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:53.809
and how exciting it is to take- That's how
I feel about different types of books, too.

00:26:53.809 --> 00:26:58.450
GENE: So, was it your love of books that led
to you becoming a librarian?

00:26:58.450 --> 00:26:59.759
CARLA: Sure, sure.

00:26:59.759 --> 00:27:05.809
I had musical parents and I didn't have musical
talent, so I learned early on.

00:27:05.809 --> 00:27:07.649
But I always loved to read.

00:27:07.649 --> 00:27:14.999
And when I found out that there was a profession,
something that you could do to introduce and

00:27:14.999 --> 00:27:16.799
really get the excitement- I mean, look.

00:27:16.799 --> 00:27:17.799
We're right here.

00:27:17.799 --> 00:27:23.029
We're stomping our feet, we're talking about
Superman and we're doing all this cool stuff.

00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:26.929
And so, when I found out about being a librarian,
I was hooked on that, too.

00:27:26.929 --> 00:27:30.140
GENE: Was there a moment when you knew you
were gonna be a librarian?

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:31.140
CARLA: Yes.

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:38.309
There was a moment when I was working in a
store front library, similar to the one when

00:27:38.309 --> 00:27:40.169
I found out about ...
GENE: Okay.

00:27:40.169 --> 00:27:44.549
CARLA: Yeah, Bright April back in New York,
in Queens.

00:27:44.549 --> 00:27:48.070
I was working with a young man named Leonard.

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:51.649
He was 10 and he would come in every day.

00:27:51.649 --> 00:27:56.029
And I was kind of an apprentice, I wasn't
a librarian yet.

00:27:56.029 --> 00:28:01.279
I hadn't even started library school, and
he would come in every day and just sit next

00:28:01.279 --> 00:28:02.450
to me.

00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:08.769
I would give him stuff, and he would draw
because a lot of the kids made fun of him.

00:28:08.769 --> 00:28:15.100
And so, just knowing, and putting the right
book with Leonard, and getting him to draw

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:17.820
and stuff, was when I said, "Okay.

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:18.820
This is cool stuff."

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:20.289
GENE: That's great.

00:28:20.289 --> 00:28:22.669
I do think that maybe that's a thing, too.

00:28:22.669 --> 00:28:28.330
Maybe kids who other kids might make fun of,
often drift towards books.

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:29.580
I was definitely one of those kids.

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:33.640
I was a kid where other kids would make fun
of me, but I was also a kid who would make

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.640
fun of other kids.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.130
I was on both sides-
CARLA: You were both.

00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:37.130
GENE: I was a jerk.

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:38.840
I was definitely a jerk.

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.450
People were jerks to me and I was also a jerk
back.

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:47.419
CARLA: They were jerks to me and I was one
of those kids that all the, I wasn't one of

00:28:47.419 --> 00:28:49.279
the cool ones and everything.

00:28:49.279 --> 00:28:54.460
The last day of school, I'd have to run home
because all the cool girls would say they

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:55.979
were gonna beat me up.

00:28:55.979 --> 00:28:58.789
But I could run fast.

00:28:58.789 --> 00:29:01.179
GENE: I couldn't run fast.

00:29:01.179 --> 00:29:02.950
CARLA: See, so you had to fight back.

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:03.950
GENE: Yeah.

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:05.240
CARLA: You had to be a jerk, too.

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.179
GENE: Yeah, I had to be a jerk, too.

00:29:07.179 --> 00:29:12.830
But, I do think working on books, writing
and drawing, is a way of working that stuff

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:13.830
out.

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:17.910
If you have problems in your life- I think
all of us do.

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:20.960
Writing and drawing is a great way of just
figuring that out for yourself.

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:25.869
I have a friend who's an art teacher, teaches
art at a high school and he says out of all

00:29:25.869 --> 00:29:32.899
of the classes that a kid takes in high school,
the art class is the only one where the subject

00:29:32.899 --> 00:29:33.899
is themselves.

00:29:33.899 --> 00:29:34.899
CARLA: Wow.

00:29:34.899 --> 00:29:35.899
GENE: They're trying to figure themselves
out by making art.

00:29:35.899 --> 00:29:40.129
I think that's true, not just of drawing,
but also of any kind of art, including writing.

00:29:40.129 --> 00:29:41.700
CARLA: What about music, too?

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:42.820
And stuff like that.

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:43.820
GENE: Yeah, music too.

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:44.820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:48.970
I think that's why sometimes if you have things
that are painful in your life, you can find

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:51.669
a little bit of healing by writing and by
drawing.

00:29:51.669 --> 00:29:54.529
CARLA: So, did you and I have to ask you this.

00:29:54.529 --> 00:29:58.679
In drawing superheroes and things like that,
did you get any revenge?

00:29:58.679 --> 00:30:06.929
GENE: Did I make up bad guys based on ... I
don't think I ever did it consciously 'cause

00:30:06.929 --> 00:30:11.749
I was worried about getting in trouble, but
the very first superhero comic I did was in

00:30:11.749 --> 00:30:12.749
fifth grade.

00:30:12.749 --> 00:30:16.549
I did it with my friend Jeremy Kinioshi, who
was half Jewish and half Japanese.

00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:21.390
We were both the comic book kids in our class.

00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:25.249
During lunch when our more athletic friends
were playing tetherball- Do y'all still play

00:30:25.249 --> 00:30:26.249
tetherball?

00:30:26.249 --> 00:30:27.249
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:27.249 --> 00:30:28.249
GENE: It's awesome, right?

00:30:28.249 --> 00:30:29.549
Except that I was terrible at it.

00:30:29.549 --> 00:30:31.570
The ball would always hit me in the head.

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:35.519
So, instead of playing tetherball, Jeremy
and I would sit at the tables and we would

00:30:35.519 --> 00:30:36.519
draw comics together.

00:30:36.519 --> 00:30:40.919
Then we would give our originals to his mom,
who would take 'em to work with her and wait

00:30:40.919 --> 00:30:44.629
till all of her coworkers went home and sneak
photocopies for us.

00:30:44.629 --> 00:30:48.060
We would take these photocopies, we stapled
them by hand to make our own comics, and we

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:51.509
sold our comics to our classmates for 50 cents
a piece.

00:30:51.509 --> 00:30:52.509
It was awesome.

00:30:52.509 --> 00:30:53.509
We made $8.

00:30:53.509 --> 00:30:54.509
It was the best.

00:30:54.509 --> 00:30:58.779
Nowadays, if you want to do the same thing
you cannot sell for 50 cents.

00:30:58.779 --> 00:30:59.779
Prices have gone up.

00:30:59.779 --> 00:31:03.190
You've gotta charge at least $1.50, but it
was great.

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:04.190
It was great.

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:08.479
I think working on that comic taught me how
to tell stories.

00:31:08.479 --> 00:31:12.629
Working on that comic gave me a way of- I
was also a pretty shy kid, too.

00:31:12.629 --> 00:31:14.120
It was weird, right?

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:16.789
Being shy and also a jerk, but I was a pretty
shy kid.

00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:20.470
So working on that comic gave me a way of
expressing myself in ways that I couldn't

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:22.490
by just talking.

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:24.549
CARLA: How did the stories come to you?

00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:27.289
Did you just wake up and-
GENE: Okay.

00:31:27.289 --> 00:31:33.450
When I was in fifth grade, I thought I was
kind of like a ... I thought I was super creative

00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:34.450
and stuff.

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:35.450
So, I thought, "Oh man.

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:39.529
I just woke up in this character form, fully
informed in my head."

00:31:39.529 --> 00:31:43.441
But then as an adult, I look back on the character
we made up and I realize no, he was actually

00:31:43.441 --> 00:31:44.441
just a rip off.

00:31:44.441 --> 00:31:51.059
He was a rip off character of Robin Hood 'cause
he wore all green and he lived in the woods

00:31:51.059 --> 00:31:54.820
and he had a band of friends that he used
to call his "Merry Men", just like Robin Hood.

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:56.440
CARLA: Yeah, I think that's pretty close.

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:57.700
GENE: Yes, isn't it?

00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:58.700
It's a little close.

00:31:58.700 --> 00:31:59.700
CARLA: Yeah.

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:00.770
GENE: But, there was one difference.

00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:04.529
The difference was, our character, instead
of fighting with a bow and arrow, he actually

00:32:04.529 --> 00:32:08.200
had a discus of death that he would throw
at people's heads.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:10.649
CARLA: You were kind of a True Crime fantasy
stuff.

00:32:10.649 --> 00:32:11.649
GENE: A little bit.

00:32:11.649 --> 00:32:17.139
CARLA: Yeah, that was a little bit of-
GENE: You know, I actually think now, as an

00:32:17.139 --> 00:32:21.899
adult, even though that one character was
terrible, I do think sometimes kids think

00:32:21.899 --> 00:32:26.129
creativity is just like when you make stuff
up out of nothing.

00:32:26.129 --> 00:32:27.929
But that's almost never true.

00:32:27.929 --> 00:32:30.619
You can't make stuff up out of nothing.

00:32:30.619 --> 00:32:37.590
What real creativity is, I think, is combining
things together that were never combined before.

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:41.129
So, if you love superheroes and you take something
else that you love- I don't know.

00:32:41.129 --> 00:32:42.139
Maybe like, chocolate cake.

00:32:42.139 --> 00:32:46.679
And you figure out a way to make a superhero
based on chocolate cake, that'll be a really

00:32:46.679 --> 00:32:47.679
creative idea.

00:32:47.679 --> 00:32:48.679
CARLA: Let's work on that one.

00:32:48.679 --> 00:32:49.679
GENE: Yeah.

00:32:49.679 --> 00:32:50.679
I agree.

00:32:50.679 --> 00:32:53.679
CARLA: It's something, though, when you think
about.

00:32:53.679 --> 00:32:55.220
So, what are you working on now?

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:57.379
What is the Reading Without Walls?

00:32:57.379 --> 00:32:59.090
GENE: Yes.

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:01.629
CARLA: Don't forget the bookmarks and everything.

00:33:01.629 --> 00:33:02.669
GENE: That's right.

00:33:02.669 --> 00:33:09.259
Two January's ago, I was in this very room,
in January of 2016.

00:33:09.259 --> 00:33:13.759
The Library of Congress, Every Child a Reader,
and the Children's Book Council, they gave

00:33:13.759 --> 00:33:15.229
me this fancy medal.

00:33:15.229 --> 00:33:17.869
To this day, this is the fanciest thing I
own.

00:33:17.869 --> 00:33:21.320
This is as bling-bling as Gene Yang gets.

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:23.299
If you want to touch this, come up later.

00:33:23.299 --> 00:33:24.299
I'll let you touch it.

00:33:24.299 --> 00:33:25.299
It's kind of awesome.

00:33:25.299 --> 00:33:26.299
CARLA: It's got your name engraved, too.

00:33:26.299 --> 00:33:27.299
GENE: Yeah, it's got my name on the back.

00:33:27.299 --> 00:33:28.299
CARLA: I see it.

00:33:28.299 --> 00:33:29.299
Oh, cool.

00:33:29.299 --> 00:33:30.489
GENE: Yeah, it's got my name on the back and
they named me the fifth national ambassador

00:33:30.489 --> 00:33:32.590
for young people's literature.

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:40.110
Which just means that, for my two year term;
2016 and 2017, my job is to get both more

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:42.289
kids reading and kids reading more.

00:33:42.289 --> 00:33:45.580
The way I'm doing that is, I've been going
around the country issuing what I call the

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:47.629
"Reading Without Walls Challenge."

00:33:47.629 --> 00:33:52.659
You know, one of the best things about growing
up is you all get to explore the world.

00:33:52.659 --> 00:33:56.580
That's your primary job right now, is to figure
out how the world works.

00:33:56.580 --> 00:34:03.080
And books are a great way of exploring the
world, so I want us all to read books outside

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:04.169
of our comfort zones.

00:34:04.169 --> 00:34:07.230
Read books that are actually exploring books.

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:10.440
Books that are not the normal books that we
would read.

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:14.270
So, the challenge works like this; you could
either do this as a community, or you can

00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:15.849
do this just as an individual reader.

00:34:15.849 --> 00:34:17.450
You set yourself a due date.

00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:20.230
By that due date, just do one of three things.

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:24.060
Number one, you can read a book about a character
who doesn't look like you or live like you.

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:26.040
Somebody who's very different from you.

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:30.440
Two, you could read a book about a topic that
you might not know anything about.

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:32.660
Something that you might even find intimidating.

00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:37.080
Or three, you can read a book in a format
that you normally wouldn't read for fun.

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:41.510
If normally all you read are chapter books,
I want you to give a graphic novel a try.

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:45.679
If normally all you read are graphic novels
and comic books, then I want you to try a

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:49.429
chapter book or a collection of poetry or
an audio book.

00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:53.340
Just try lots of different kinds of stories
in different formats.

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:59.359
If you really want to go for the gold star,
find a book that fits all three of those categories.

00:34:59.359 --> 00:35:05.230
I've been talking about this all over America
to different communities, and I've really

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:10.260
been shocked by the ways in which readers
and librarians and teachers and book store

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:12.670
owners have really come up and met this challenge.

00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:13.670
It's been great.

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:17.810
CARLA: When I thought about you being here
and talking about Reading Without Walls and

00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:21.599
books that I've read that, at first I thought,
"Ugh.

00:35:21.599 --> 00:35:22.599
I don't know."

00:35:22.599 --> 00:35:24.270
I thought about the book, Sea Biscuit.

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:25.270
GENE: Okay.

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:26.270
CARLA: Okay?

00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:32.349
It's about a horse and I'm like, "I've only
seen in person, maybe two horses in my life,

00:35:32.349 --> 00:35:33.349
right?"

00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:34.349
City kid, all of this.

00:35:34.349 --> 00:35:35.590
That wasn't it.

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:43.100
It's all about this horse who was an underdog
and he was a half mule, and a half this, and

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:45.300
nobody thought he could win.

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:51.590
And when I got into the book though, learned
all about horses and that, but also the spirit

00:35:51.590 --> 00:35:59.470
of the underdog and that theme came through
and I turned into a Sea Biscuit fan, and watched

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:00.710
horse races.

00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:02.120
GENE: That's great, that's great.

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:04.070
CARLA: 'Cause now I know a little bit about
it.

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:06.460
GENE: Something similar happened to me with
basketball.

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:10.100
As a kid, I hated basketball because I was
terrible at it.

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:13.470
I had these friends who were really good at
it and whenever we played, it was just like

00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:14.470
tetherball.

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:17.190
The basketball would find a way of hitting
me in the head, so I hated it.

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:18.380
I didn't follow basketball.

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:22.770
I remember in college, I lived with these
guys who were huge basketball fans and we

00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:26.500
would watch movies at home, on our VCR- Y'all
know what that is?

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:27.500
A VCR?

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:28.500
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:29.500
CARLA: You do?!

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:30.980
GENE: It's like Netflix, except you have to
have these-

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:31.980
CARLA: A VCR?

00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:33.540
GENE: That you stick in.

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:39.960
We'd watch movies on our VCR and then when
10:30, 10:45 came around, they would force

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:45.070
us to pause the movie so that they could watch
sports highlights on the news.

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:47.160
I was always so mad about it.

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:49.720
But a few years ago, I started reading books
about basketball.

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:54.560
I read one called Outside the Paint, about
the basketball scene in 1940 San Francisco

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:55.600
China Town.

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:56.600
I read Slam Dunk.

00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:57.600
You ever read Slam Dunk?

00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.190
CARLA: I've heard of it.

00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:00.190
GENE: It's amazing.

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:01.190
It's awesome.

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:02.190
One of the best (inaudible) series out there.

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:04.340
I read Matt Dellapina's Ball Don't Lie.

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:07.010
Read a bunch of books about basketball and
that got me really interested.

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:09.880
Now, I'm still not an expert.

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:11.780
I'm still no basketball expert.

00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:15.850
When I watch a basketball game now, there
will still be times when all the action will

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:21.290
stop on the court and I'll have no understanding
of why, but at least I feel it.

00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:22.290
You know what I mean?

00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:25.370
I can feel the thrill of the game now and
it's because of books.

00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:28.090
CARLA: Right, and things that you've never
experienced.

00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:29.090
GENE: Yes.

00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:31.060
CARLA: But really getting into it and saying,
"Okay.

00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:32.060
I'm a try this.

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:33.060
I'm a try it."

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:34.060
GENE: Yeah.

00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:35.380
CARLA: Now I noticed something here.

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:37.490
This easel with nothing on it.

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:38.490
GENE: Yes.

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:39.900
CARLA: Were you gonna put something on it?

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:43.500
I mean, were we gonna actually-
GENE: We can put something on it.

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:49.870
What I was thinking we could do, is maybe
we could design a superhero together.

00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:51.100
Does that sound okay?

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:52.100
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:53.330
GENE: We can design a superhero together.

00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:55.210
Okay, we'll start from the head and we'll
move down.

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:56.210
CARLA: Don't forget the chocolate.

00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:57.210
GENE: Yes!

00:37:57.210 --> 00:37:59.080
Maybe a chocolate cake superhero.

00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:00.340
CARLA: You don't have to.

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:04.970
GENE: I'm gonna start by giving them a big
round head.

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:06.950
CARLA: Does the head have to be- Okay.

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:07.950
Round.

00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:08.950
GENE: All right, big round head.

00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:12.100
Now somebody tell me, what's on the superhero's
face?

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:13.400
What do you think is on the superhero's face?

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:14.930
Yes, young lady right there?

00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:17.640
AUDIENCE: A mustache.

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:19.220
GENE: A mustache!

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:21.240
Okay, a mustache.

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:24.609
CARLA: Okay now, all right.

00:38:24.609 --> 00:38:27.730
I have a little mustache, so-
GENE: Okay, a mustache and then what else?

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:29.740
What else is on his face?

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:30.740
Go ahead.

00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:32.630
AUDIENCE: A round top hat.

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:33.630
GENE: A round top hat.

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:38.130
You all are going with some really non-traditional
superhero gear, which is fine.

00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:41.640
Okay, so a round top hat.

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:44.710
CARLA: Are they pulling our legs?

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:46.140
GENE: A round top hat?

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:47.140
What else?

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:48.140
What else?

00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:49.140
Tell me about this character's ears.

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:50.280
Tell me about this character's ears.

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:53.800
AUDIENCE: He should have little candles sticking
out the side of his head.

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:54.930
GENE: Candles?

00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:57.060
Candles instead of ears.

00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:58.060
Okay.

00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:00.790
CARLA: You don't have to go with the chocolate
cake.

00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:01.790
It's okay.

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:02.790
Don't worry.

00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:05.920
We'll just have some chocolate cake later.

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:09.880
GENE: Okay.

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:13.650
Candles sticking out of the side of his head
instead of ears.

00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:20.840
Okay, we still haven't gotten to- Somebody
tell me about his eyes.

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:21.920
Yes.

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:24.080
AUDIENCE: Glasses.

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:28.410
GENE: He has glasses.

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:29.490
Okay.

00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:33.860
CARLA: Some of my older colleagues might remember
Mr. Magoo.

00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:37.450
We kind of have a Mr. Magoo look.

00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:39.970
GENE: All right, let's start moving down now.

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:41.750
Tell me about this character's body.

00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:43.660
Yes, young lady.

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:45.570
AUDIENCE: A jumpsuit.

00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:47.480
GENE: A jumpsuit.

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:48.480
What kind of jumpsuit?

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.200
Give me a little bit more information about
this jumpsuit.

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.200
AUDIENCE: An orange one.

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:52.200
GENE: Orange?

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.200
Okay, so I don't have orange.

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:54.200
Oh, I do!

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:55.200
I do have orange.

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:57.810
Okay, an orange jumpsuit.

00:39:57.810 --> 00:39:58.930
Like a track suit?

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:01.170
Is that what you're thinking?

00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:02.170
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:05.670
GENE: Like, old school, Run DMC style track
suit?

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:08.330
Okay, let's do this.

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:11.790
CARLA: Orange.

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:18.720
GENE: Okay, a jumpsuit.

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:21.840
I have actually never personally worn a jumpsuit.

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:26.240
So I'm not entirely positive what one looks
like.

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:36.740
Tell me if I do it right, okay?

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:39.810
Don't jumpsuits normally have like a ...
CARLA: Oh yeah.

00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:41.330
Coming down the side.

00:40:41.330 --> 00:40:42.740
GENE: Stripes on the side?

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:44.100
Is that true?

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:47.530
Am I making that up?

00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:49.530
And you wanted orange?

00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:50.650
We have red up here.

00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:52.240
Is red close enough?

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.240
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:54.630
GENE: All right, red.

00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:55.630
We'll do red.

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:58.560
CARLA: Looking kind of spiffy.

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:02.970
GENE: All right, then somebody tell me about
his hands.

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:03.970
CARLA: Ooh.

00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:05.460
GENE: Somebody tell me about his hands.

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:06.460
Yes.

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:07.530
AUDIENCE: Tentacles.

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:09.610
GENE: What's that?

00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:10.990
AUDIENCE: Tentacles.

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:12.380
GENE: Tentacles!

00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:13.760
CARLA: Whoo!

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:18.720
GENE: You sound like somebody who reads a
lot of Japanese comics.

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:19.720
Is that true?

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:22.280
There are a lot of tentacles in Japanese comics.

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:23.280
Okay, all right.

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.280
Let's do that.

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:26.310
We'll do tentacles.

00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:31.300
I feel like we're losing out on the chocolate
cake theme here.

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:33.480
CARLA: But that's okay.

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:34.590
They can do something else.

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:37.140
We'll have chocolate cake later.

00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:41.480
'Cause I want you to-
GENE: Okay, let's do tentacles on one side.

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:43.280
Somebody tell me about the other side.

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.750
CARLA: They can have two different?

00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:45.750
Okay.

00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:47.190
GENE: Yeah, there are no rules.

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:48.700
CARLA: No rules.

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:49.700
This is good.

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:53.090
GENE: No rules when it comes to ... Okay,
yes?

00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:55.780
AUDIENCE: First, there's cake residue on his
face.

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:57.160
GENE: Cake residue on his face?

00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.160
Okay.

00:41:58.160 --> 00:41:59.160
We can do that.

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:00.160
CARLA: This is getting personal, people.

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:01.160
AUDIENCE: There are brown-
CARLA: Cake residue.

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:04.820
AUDIENCE: Then he has a brown sparkle shooter
thing.

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:06.320
GENE: Does that look like cake residue?

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.440
That looks like he just has a fungus on his
face.

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:09.620
Don't you think?

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:10.800
CARLA: Excuse me.

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:16.540
GENE: Okay, cake residue on his face and then
what was the other thing?

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:19.731
AUDIENCE: Then his hand is like, a sparkle
shooter.

00:42:19.731 --> 00:42:20.731
It's a brown sparkle shooter thing.

00:42:20.731 --> 00:42:21.750
GENE: A sparkle shooter?

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:23.010
AUDIENCE: A brown sparkle shooter.

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:27.310
GENE: I'm gonna guess as to what a sparkle
shooter looks like, all right?

00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:29.430
AUDIENCE: It's a cake shooter.

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:33.580
GENE: Is this what a sparkle shooter looks
like?

00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:37.480
That actually looks like dandelions.

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:41.090
Maybe I'll add more color and it'll look more
like a sparkle shooter.

00:42:41.090 --> 00:42:42.540
Okay.

00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:47.260
All right, somebody tell me about his feet.

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:50.370
All the way over there?

00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:52.950
AUDIENCE: One is really big and the other
is really small.

00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:55.400
GENE: One is really big and the other's really
small.

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:56.400
Good, good.

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:57.400
We'll do that.

00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:01.100
Then how about his shoes?

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:02.460
What do his shoes look like?

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:04.810
Yes, young lady here.

00:43:04.810 --> 00:43:08.290
AUDIENCE: It should be one pink and one red.

00:43:08.290 --> 00:43:10.780
GENE: One pink and one red.

00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:13.090
One foot is really big, and one foot's really
small.

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:17.890
All right.

00:43:17.890 --> 00:43:20.080
Here's his really big foot.

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:24.260
It's like a clown foot.

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:28.370
And here's his really small foot.

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:36.850
And we'll do some laces.

00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:39.680
One is pink and one is red, you said?

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:40.910
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:41.910
GENE:Okay.

00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:46.930
All I have are red, blue, green, and purple
up here.

00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:50.630
Is there an alternative to pink that we could
choose?

00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:53.010
AUDIENCE: Purple.

00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:55.380
GENE: Purple.

00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:57.760
Got it.

00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.030
Anything else you want to add?

00:43:59.030 --> 00:44:04.410
How about a little animal sidekick?

00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:06.140
Who would his animal sidekick be?

00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:07.140
CARLA: Whoa.

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:08.810
GENE: Who would his animal sidekick be?

00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:09.810
Yes, young lady right here.

00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:14.620
AUDIENCE: A talking cherry.

00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:21.650
GENE: A talking cherry?

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:24.630
All right.

00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:26.130
Okay.

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:30.600
We'll do that.

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:35.080
CARLA: A cherry?

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:36.570
Okay.

00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:39.560
GENE: Okay.

00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:43.040
I think we're pretty close to being done.

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:46.420
CARLA: I think there's some more.

00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:48.720
GENE: Let's do one more thing.

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:49.720
One more thing.

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:51.710
CARLA: Can they have another sidekick?

00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:56.270
AUDIENCE: On his shoes, add cupcake boosters.

00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:57.930
GENE: Cupcake boosters.

00:44:57.930 --> 00:44:59.390
That's amazing.

00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:00.390
Okay.

00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:03.930
So, what would a cupcake booster even look
like?

00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:14.365
It would look like-
AUDIENCE: A cupcake with jets in it.

00:45:14.365 --> 00:45:15.365
GENE: All right.

00:45:15.365 --> 00:45:16.990
I think we need one last thing.

00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:20.490
We need one last thing and that is ...
CARLA: Hair.

00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:24.410
GENE: What is his name?

00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:25.690
What is his name?

00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:30.290
Yes, young lady right there.

00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:34.710
AUDIENCE: It should be ... Jeff the Weirdo.

00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:35.710
GENE: Jack?

00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:36.710
AUDIENCE: Jeff.

00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:38.300
GENE: Jeff the Weirdo.

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:39.520
CARLA: I think that fits.

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.770
GENE: Are you mad at somebody named Jeff right
now?

00:45:40.770 --> 00:45:41.770
AUDIENCE: Huh?

00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:43.230
GENE: Are you mad at somebody named Jeff right
now?

00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:44.230
AUDIENCE: No.

00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:47.250
GENE: Okay, Jeff the Weirdo.

00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:48.450
Jeff the Weirdo.

00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:50.570
CARLA: Superhero.

00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:55.860
GENE: Who is a superhero.

00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:58.110
CARLA: Jeff would attract attention.

00:45:58.110 --> 00:46:01.540
GENE: Weirdo is "E" before "I", right?

00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:06.200
It's one of the few words that doesn't follow
that rule.

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:09.340
CARLA: Who saves the day.

00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:11.370
GENE: How about his cherry sidekick?

00:46:11.370 --> 00:46:14.290
What's the cherry sidekick's name?

00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:15.380
Yes.

00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:16.472
AUDIENCE: Peep Peep.

00:46:16.472 --> 00:46:19.120
GENE: Peep Peep?

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:23.900
Peep Peep.

00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:30.290
CARLA: I'm not sure if this is gonna get optioned
for television.

00:46:30.290 --> 00:46:31.370
I'm not sure.

00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:32.370
Might.

00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:40.180
GENE: All right, so I will talk to DC Comics
to see if Jeff the Weirdo and his talking

00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:45.710
Peep Peep character can actually make their
way into the DC Universe.

00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:46.710
No guarantees.

00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:47.710
No guarantees.

00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:55.180
But I'd like you all to give yourselves a
round of applause.

00:46:55.180 --> 00:47:00.980
That is truly a superhero like I have never
seen before.

00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:03.370
CARLA: Never seen before.

00:47:03.370 --> 00:47:04.570
GENE: Yeah.

00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:05.770
What's that?

00:47:05.770 --> 00:47:09.360
AUDIENCE: You forgot an icing cape.

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:10.440
GENE: An icing cape.

00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:12.460
We'll have to add that in, in the second issue.

00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:15.340
CARLA: Ah, the second issue.

00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:17.190
AUDIENCE: And his symbol.

00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:20.900
GENE: Oh yeah, and he needs a symbol.

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:21.900
You're right.

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:25.110
Those are all things that he has to earn in
issue number two.

00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:28.020
CARLA: And that's how you develop different
issues, right?

00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:30.560
GENE: That's how you develop different issues,
yeah.

00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:32.600
I've written in two different environments.

00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:38.210
I've written for graphic novels, where you
just make up a story and you tell it from,

00:47:38.210 --> 00:47:40.310
beginning to end, all in one shot usually.

00:47:40.310 --> 00:47:44.230
I've also worked on series, so right now I'm
working on a series called Secret Coders and

00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:49.160
I'm working on a series for DC Comics called
New Superman, about this brand new character.

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:51.770
A Chinese Superman in the DC Universe.

00:47:51.770 --> 00:47:52.770
CARLA: Cool.

00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:53.770
Oh you're giving it a hand?

00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:54.770
GENE: Thank you.

00:47:54.770 --> 00:48:02.110
When you're working on a series there is this
element of making things up as you go along.

00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:06.460
It's kind of like when I was your age and
I would tell stories.

00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:08.370
I would just make it up as I went along.

00:48:08.370 --> 00:48:09.660
Working on a series is like that.

00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:10.660
CARLA: Wow.

00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:12.450
Now the Secret Coders?

00:48:12.450 --> 00:48:13.450
Tell me about that one.

00:48:13.450 --> 00:48:18.460
GENE: Secret Coders is a graphic novel series
I'm doing with a friend of mine named Mike

00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:19.460
Holmes.

00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:21.491
Before becoming a full time cartoonist, I
taught high school computer science.

00:48:21.491 --> 00:48:24.579
I taught kids how to code computers for 17
years.

00:48:24.579 --> 00:48:29.320
And I've always wanted to take what I did
in my classroom and stick it into a graphic

00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:30.570
novel series.

00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:33.281
That's exactly what Secret Coders is.

00:48:33.281 --> 00:48:37.260
Mike and I are trying to teach kids how to
code computers through this comic book series.

00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:39.410
There will be six volumes in all.

00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:41.230
Volume number three just came out.

00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:42.230
We're really excited about it.

00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:43.230
CARLA: Yeah.

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:44.230
GENE: We're super excited about it.

00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:46.900
CARLA: How many of you know how to code, or
what coding is?

00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:48.220
All right, very good.

00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:50.210
GENE: A good number of you.

00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:51.960
That's great, that's great.

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:57.200
Now, speaking of computers, how do you think
things are changing for the library?

00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:02.940
CARLA: The Library of Congress, for instance,
right now you can go up on the website and

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:05.520
we just revamped it.

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:13.190
It looks much, much cooler and you can download
from thousands and thousands of photographs

00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:16.710
in the collection of the library and use them
however you want to.

00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:17.710
GENE: Wow, for free.

00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:19.150
CARLA: It's really something, for free.

00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:20.800
GENE: Download, and where are these photos
from?

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:22.650
CARLA: They're from everywhere.

00:49:22.650 --> 00:49:26.600
We have photographs that tell you about history.

00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:29.580
We have
photographs that other people have taken to

00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:36.170
show different cultures and you can just about
type any subject in and photographs will come

00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:41.780
that you can then download and use in any
report, in any art, any way you want to use

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:42.780
them.

00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:44.230
So, that's what makes it cool.

00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:45.540
GENE: That's great.

00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:49.050
You don't have a favorite photo in your collection,
do you?

00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:50.340
CARLA: Not yet.

00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:55.580
I'm six months in and I'm discovering, so
I'm tweeting.

00:49:55.580 --> 00:50:02.490
And every day that I'm here, I put up something
cool that I've found and I've seen.

00:50:02.490 --> 00:50:09.500
Like Thomas Jefferson's handwriting in his
own hand when he was working on the Declaration

00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:10.560
of Independence.

00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:15.490
And Seeing him and what he put in, and what
he took out.

00:50:15.490 --> 00:50:20.530
I think people don't realize there are drafts
of certain things that you hear about, but

00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:24.220
they did a lot of cross outs and thought about
things.

00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:29.280
And it's really nice to see, okay, this didn't
come up just perfect.

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:30.530
That they had to work on it.

00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:31.530
GENE: Yeah.

00:50:31.530 --> 00:50:37.230
I actually think that that was something that
I had to learn as I grew up and started making

00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:38.920
stories as an adult.

00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:43.280
When I was a kid and I read books, I always
thought, "Man, this came into that author's

00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:45.170
head perfectly formed.

00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:47.970
They just wrote it down and sent it to the
publisher.

00:50:47.970 --> 00:50:49.310
The publisher made it into a book."

00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:52.440
After I got into books, I realized that is
not the case at all.

00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:55.140
That there's so much revision that happens.

00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:58.841
There's so much stuff where you write something
down and you're not super satisfied with it.

00:50:58.841 --> 00:51:02.860
You just change it and change it, and tweak
it and tweak it until it gets to where you

00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:03.860
want it to be.

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:07.470
I would say maybe even half of writing, half
of making stories, is that.

00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:09.332
CARLA: Is changing and making-
GENE: Yeah.

00:51:09.332 --> 00:51:13.770
CARLA: So when you see that even the Declaration
of Independence, there were cross outs and

00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:16.570
there were thoughts and there were things
like that.

00:51:16.570 --> 00:51:19.130
And Abraham Lincoln, the Gettysburg address.

00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:22.980
To see his whole handwriting and what he thought.

00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:26.943
GENE: Even somebody like Abraham Lincoln couldn't
get it right the first time, right?

00:51:26.943 --> 00:51:28.660
CARLA: Couldn't get it right the first time,
but he worked on it.

00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:29.660
GENE: Had to go back and change it.

00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:34.960
CARLA: And the thing about Abraham Lincoln,
that wonderful speech that he gave was the

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:37.130
shortest speech that day.

00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:39.171
One guy gave a speech for three hours.

00:51:39.171 --> 00:51:42.260
Can you imagine?

00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:43.910
One speech, three hours.

00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:46.830
And Abraham Lincoln got up and it was five
minutes.

00:51:46.830 --> 00:51:51.740
They said that was the best speech of the
day because it was short and to the point.

00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:53.600
GENE: Yeah, yeah.

00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:59.130
Another thing that I had to learn as a professional
writer is that, often longer doesn't mean

00:51:59.130 --> 00:52:00.130
better.

00:52:00.130 --> 00:52:04.670
I remember when I was in high school and I
would write things for my English class, I

00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:12.060
would always try to make my sentences as long
as possible and I would put in as many big

00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:14.320
words as I could.

00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:16.330
Words where I barely even understood what
they meant.

00:52:16.330 --> 00:52:17.330
CARLA: Right.

00:52:17.330 --> 00:52:20.710
GENE: I wanted to do it because I felt like
it would make me sound smarter.

00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:26.530
But, now, as an adult, as a professional writer,
I realize what makes you sound smart is actually

00:52:26.530 --> 00:52:28.070
just being clear.

00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:33.220
If you can say something as clearly as possible,
as simply as possible, that is the best and

00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:35.440
the smartest way of saying it.

00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:40.980
CARLA: Have you ever ... A book that I read
in a different format, the Reading Without

00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:43.430
Words, is a graphic novel.

00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:47.510
A graphic march by John Lewis about the civil
rights.

00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:48.510
GENE: Yeah.

00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:49.510
CARLA: Oh you've read it?

00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:50.510
Oh, good.

00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:51.510
'Cause I hadn't ever read.

00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:52.510
Sorry, Gene.

00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:53.510
GENE: No, not at all.

00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:58.710
CARLA: Never really read a graphic book and
I thought, "Oh."

00:52:58.710 --> 00:53:04.490
Then I got into it and then I was like, "Wow,
I want volume two and volume three."

00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:08.910
We're even thinking, and I talked to you about
that, a graphic book about the Library of

00:53:08.910 --> 00:53:10.010
Congress.

00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:13.240
What do you think about that?

00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:17.690
Telling the story of the Library of Congress
in graphic format.

00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:22.240
GENE: Yeah, I think that's an amazing book
series, March.

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:23.880
How many of you have read March?

00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:24.880
Awesome.

00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:27.800
If you haven't read it yet, you are in for
a treat.

00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:29.930
Go and find it at your local library.

00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:31.590
I'm sure they'll have it.

00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:32.590
Read it.

00:53:32.590 --> 00:53:35.120
It's a non-fiction book, so it's about real
events.

00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:37.390
It's an autobiography.

00:53:37.390 --> 00:53:41.300
It's Congressman John Lewis writing about
his life.

00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:46.460
I recently visited a museum, it's called the
Toonseum.

00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:53.690
It's out of Pittsburgh and there they have
a focus on comics art.

00:53:53.690 --> 00:53:58.110
It's all these pages of comic book stories,
it's pages from graphic novels.

00:53:58.110 --> 00:54:02.430
It's the originals so you can see how the
artist actually draws.

00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:08.360
They had an exhibit there, an old comic book
that most of us don't remember, but it was

00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:14.200
about Martin Luther King Jr and it was a 22
page comic.

00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:20.130
John Lewis, Congressman John Lewis, when he
was a kid he read that comic book and that

00:54:20.130 --> 00:54:24.650
comic book was so influential on him that
when it came time for him to tell his own

00:54:24.650 --> 00:54:28.940
story about his own life, he wanted to tell
it as a comic book.

00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:30.830
As a thick comic book, as a graphic novel.

00:54:30.830 --> 00:54:36.290
It just goes to show that even things that
seem forgotten, like that old comic book about

00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:39.410
Martin Luther King Jr., they're not forgotten.

00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:42.370
When you tell stories, when you release your
own stories into the world,

00:54:42.370 --> 00:54:47.020
you have no idea how they're gonna effect
people years down the road.

00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:53.230
CARLA: One thing that you might not know about
the Library of Congress is that we have the

00:54:53.230 --> 00:54:58.020
largest collection of comic books in the world,
right here.

00:54:58.020 --> 00:55:00.370
Did you know that?

00:55:00.370 --> 00:55:04.620
First edition of Batman, Luke Cage, all of
that.

00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:08.700
Right here at the Library of Congress, and
we are going to display some of those things

00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:09.910
during Awesome-Con.

00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:10.910
GENE: Okay.

00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:17.230
CARLA: That's gonna be here in Washington
DC with movies and comics and all of these

00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:18.230
types of things.

00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:20.240
And the Library of Congress is gonna be part
of Awesome-Con.

00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:22.810
GENE: That's so great.

00:55:22.810 --> 00:55:23.810
CARLA: We're getting there.

00:55:23.810 --> 00:55:27.140
GENE: There's so many reasons why the Library
of Congress is awesome.

00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:31.400
Yet another reason; largest comic book collection
in the entire world.

00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:38.190
It looks like we're winding down, so we would
like now, to take questions from all of you.

00:55:38.190 --> 00:55:42.930
We have a whole bunch of students joining
us from all over the country and unfortunately

00:55:42.930 --> 00:55:45.550
those students are not gonna be able to ask
us questions.

00:55:45.550 --> 00:55:49.360
So, I want to acknowledge that they're with
us first, and then we'll take some questions

00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:50.820
from the kids in the room.

00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:51.820
Okay?

00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:58.500
Right now we're being joined by Alderman Elementary,
by Valley Springs Middle School, by St. Stevens

00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:05.740
Elementary, Hopewell Elementary of Trinity,
Jacob's Fork Middle School, Triad Math and

00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:13.060
Science Academy, St. Ambrose School, Norton
High, North Columbus Elementary, the College

00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:21.090
of Education at Governor's State University,
and students from DC Public Schools all around

00:56:21.090 --> 00:56:22.090
the city.

00:56:22.090 --> 00:56:23.090
So, thank you all so much for joining us.

00:56:23.090 --> 00:56:24.600
CARLA: Thank you.

00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:32.100
GENE: So, kids in the room, what kind of questions
can we answer for you?

00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:33.100
Yes.

00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:39.620
AUDIENCE: Okay, this question might sound
weird, but is DC Comics, is it a building

00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:40.620
in DC?

00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:42.090
Or is it just called DC Comics?

00:56:42.090 --> 00:56:47.560
GENE: That is not a weird question at all
'cause DC's name is super confusing, right?

00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:48.810
It's a weird name.

00:56:48.810 --> 00:56:50.670
Marvel makes sense, I think.

00:56:50.670 --> 00:56:53.080
DC Comics is a little bit weird.

00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:56.320
DC Comics' office building used to be in New
York City.

00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:59.060
It was in New York City for decades and decades.

00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:02.930
Now, it's in Burbank, California, which is
just outside of Hollywood.

00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:08.550
I got to visit the DC Comics office a couple
of times now and it's pretty awesome.

00:57:08.550 --> 00:57:11.160
You walk into their waiting area.

00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:16.190
They have giant statues of Superman, Batman,
and Wonder Woman, wearing the costumes that

00:57:16.190 --> 00:57:19.260
they'll be wearing in the upcoming Justice
League movie.

00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:24.710
They have a chess set in the middle of the
waiting room that has, instead of the traditional

00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:29.010
chess pieces, it's like, Superman and Wonder
Woman and Batman and Joker on the other side.

00:57:29.010 --> 00:57:30.010
Really cool.

00:57:30.010 --> 00:57:35.160
The name DC Comics actually
comes from the very first comic book series

00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:37.160
that DC Comics ever published.

00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:40.960
It was called Detective Comics; it came out
in 1939.

00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:46.180
The DC of DC Comics is actually short for
Detective Comics, which makes it a really

00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:47.290
weird name, right?

00:57:47.290 --> 00:57:52.390
'Cause DC Comics means it's Detective Comic's
comics.

00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:53.490
That's just the way it is.

00:57:53.490 --> 00:57:58.780
DC is our oldest surviving comic book company
in America.

00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:03.650
You know, sometimes stuff from the olden days,
a little bit weird.

00:58:03.650 --> 00:58:06.280
Yes, young lady?

00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:15.190
AUDIENCE: For your comic books, do you have
a person who helps you have ideas for them,

00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:19.830
or is it just you by yourself having the ideas
for your books?

00:58:19.830 --> 00:58:24.760
GENE: The question is, do I just have ideas
on my own, or do I have somebody helping me

00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:26.400
with ideas?

00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:27.830
I would say it depends on the book.

00:58:27.830 --> 00:58:33.690
So, when I'm writing for DC Comics, the stories
that I'm writing are part of a bigger universe.

00:58:33.690 --> 00:58:37.690
Right now, I'm writing about a character called
Kennan Kong, who is the Chinese Superman.

00:58:37.690 --> 00:58:45.330
Kennan Kong is in the same universe as Clark
Kent, as Bruce Wayne, as all the other superheroes.

00:58:45.330 --> 00:58:48.420
In that case, I can't just have ideas on my
own.

00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:52.180
I actually have to collaborate with other
artists and with other writers.

00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:56.630
Then when I write books for my other publisher,
1st, 2nd Books, most of those are stand alone

00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:57.630
graphic novels.

00:58:57.630 --> 00:59:00.820
They're a story with a beginning, middle,
and end.

00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:04.040
For those, I generally just have ideas on
my own.

00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:08.030
Sometimes I'll work with a partner, but often
they'll start off as just in my own head.

00:59:08.030 --> 00:59:13.190
All right, that sounds like a question from
somebody who might be wondering where ideas

00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:14.190
come from.

00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:15.190
Is that true for you?

00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:16.190
Okay.

00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:18.880
So, I get this question a lot.

00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:21.900
Kids will sometimes ask me where my ideas
come from.

00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:24.700
Often, my ideas come from my own life.

00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:28.900
Sometimes, if you feel like you have a creative
assignment and you don't have any ideas for

00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:31.230
it, just think about your own life.

00:59:31.230 --> 00:59:34.650
Even if your own life seems boring, I guarantee
if you think about it long enough, it is not.

00:59:34.650 --> 00:59:39.400
For instance, the very first comic I ever
did as an adult is called Gordon Yamamoto

00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:40.400
and the King of the Geeks.

00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:44.320
It's about a young man who gets a space ship
stuck inside of his nose and becomes friends

00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:46.950
with the alien that's living inside of the
ship.

00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:48.420
That book is from my own life.

00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:49.440
CARLA: Tell us how.

00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:51.310
GENE: I have always had sinus problems.

00:59:51.310 --> 00:59:52.310
CARLA: Oh, okay.

00:59:52.310 --> 00:59:56.350
GENE: I've always had sinus problems and one
day I thought, "What if what was plugging

00:59:56.350 --> 00:59:58.680
up my nose was a space ship?"

00:59:58.680 --> 00:59:59.680
Think about your life long enough.

00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:02.360
I guarantee you, ideas are gonna come out.

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:05.060
CARLA: I need that now.

01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:06.060
GENE: Yes?

01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:10.440
AUDIENCE: How did you feel when you released
your first book?

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:13.600
GENE: How did I feel?

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:17.560
The very first book that I released was in
fifth grade.

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:18.560
It was amazing.

01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:20.860
AUDIENCE: When you were a grown up?

01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:25.690
GENE: As a grown up, the first book that I
released was Gordon Yamamoto and the King

01:00:25.690 --> 01:00:26.690
of the Geeks.

01:00:26.690 --> 01:00:29.350
I actually self-published that, so I didn't
even go through a publisher.

01:00:29.350 --> 01:00:34.240
I just got it printed up myself and I'd try
to go to stores and local comic book conventions

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:36.370
to sell it by hand.

01:00:36.370 --> 01:00:37.370
It was great.

01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:38.370
It was a lot of work.

01:00:38.370 --> 01:00:43.550
It's a lot of work to publish your own comic,
but I remember being at a comic book convention

01:00:43.550 --> 01:00:49.170
and handing that book to somebody, and having
them hand me a few dollars.

01:00:49.170 --> 01:00:54.870
It felt great that somebody wanted to read
my book so much that they were willing to

01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:56.601
part with three dollar bills for it.

01:00:56.601 --> 01:00:59.310
It was awesome.

01:00:59.310 --> 01:01:06.860
Yes, young man in the front?

01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:10.940
AUDIENCE: When did you make your first comic
book?

01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:12.750
GENE: When did I make my first comic?

01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:15.250
The very first comic I remember making was
in fifth grade.

01:01:15.250 --> 01:01:19.600
Was that, the main character was a rip off
of Robin Hood.

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:21.310
It was a terrible comic, but it was still
fun to make.

01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:24.670
CARLA: Anybody in the middle?

01:01:24.670 --> 01:01:32.020
AUDIENCE: Do you have any more copies of the
books that you had from when you were younger?

01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:33.430
GENE: Do I have any more copies?

01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:38.560
I'm sure if I went back to my parents' house
and I dug around, I'd be able to find one.

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:40.220
Yeah, of that fifth grade comic.

01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:45.120
I also, when I was in sixth grade, I made
a comic about somebody who sold shoes.

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:46.690
I don't even know what I was thinking.

01:01:46.690 --> 01:01:52.680
I made a comic about somebody who sold shoes
and I made a comic about ... Do you know what

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:54.260
the Smurfs are?
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:56.740
GENE: And you know what the Transformers are.

01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:57.740
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:03.750
GENE: I made a comic called the TransSmurfers,
where all the Smurfs would transform into

01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:05.630
robotic fruit.

01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:10.560
That was fun to work on.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:12.310
CARLA: Okay.

01:02:12.310 --> 01:02:14.060
GENE: Yes?

01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:19.100
AUDIENCE: This isn't really related to your
book, but what's your favorite basketball

01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:20.450
team, if you like basketball?

01:02:20.450 --> 01:02:24.690
GENE: Okay, the question is what is my favorite
basketball team?

01:02:24.690 --> 01:02:27.220
I want to hear yours.

01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:33.260
I come from the Bay area, so there's only
one answer, right?

01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:34.680
I have to go with the Warriors.

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:36.300
CARLA: I'm from Chicago.

01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:37.780
GENE: Yeah.

01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:39.990
There you go.

01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:42.930
CARLA: Drop the mic.

01:02:42.930 --> 01:02:44.410
Da Bears.

01:02:44.410 --> 01:02:46.410
Oh, that's football.

01:02:46.410 --> 01:02:50.560
GENE: How about the young lady right there
in the- Yeah.

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:53.560
AUDIENCE: What materials do you use to make
your comics?

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:54.740
GENE: I'm sorry, what was that?

01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:56.940
AUDIENCE: What materials do you use-
GENE: What materials?

01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:57.940
That's great.

01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:04.420
So, when I was your age, I read this book
called How to Make Comics the Marvel Way.

01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:08.580
It was written by Stan Lee and Stan Lee told
me I had to use a certain set of materials.

01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:14.930
Told me I had to use Bristol board, which
is like this super thick, white paper.

01:03:14.930 --> 01:03:16.480
Really, really thick.

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:19.030
He told me I had to use a certain kind of
pencil.

01:03:19.030 --> 01:03:23.830
He told me I had to use a brush and a bottle
of ink.

01:03:23.830 --> 01:03:26.910
So I did; that's how I started off making
comics.

01:03:26.910 --> 01:03:30.400
Then after I became an adult.

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:34.500
After I started going to conventions and hanging
out with other cartoonists, I realized that

01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:37.650
not everybody makes comics the Marvel way.

01:03:37.650 --> 01:03:42.220
Almost every cartoonist you talk to, they
will have figured out their own set of materials.

01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:46.190
So, if you want to make comics, if you want
to make are in general, you should experiment.

01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:49.650
You should figure out what materials feel
best for you.

01:03:49.650 --> 01:03:53.690
Right now, I am using a regular number two
pencil to draw.

01:03:53.690 --> 01:03:56.800
I'm using what's called a "blue pencil" to
do my sketching.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:01.820
It's a certain shade of blue called "non-photo
blue" and I no longer ink with a brush and

01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:02.820
a bottle of ink.

01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:04.800
I actually ink with a Japanese brush pen.

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:05.990
I don't need that bottle of ink anymore.

01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.990
Yes?

01:04:06.990 --> 01:04:07.990
Young lady with the headband?

01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:15.020
AUDIENCE: What is your Chinese name?

01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:17.630
GENE: My Chinese name?

01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:23.940
So, my Chinese name is- My American name is
a transliteration of my Chinese name, meaning

01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:27.720
my parents picked my American name because
it sounded kind of like my Chinese name.

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:31.110
My American name is Gene Luen Yang.

01:04:31.110 --> 01:04:34.420
My Chinese name is Yang Ging Luen.

01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:40.860
Now that middle character, Ging, has an interesting
story behind it.

01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:47.410
It's a Chinese tradition to give the gift
of gold to babies when they're first born.

01:04:47.410 --> 01:04:51.410
When I was first born, I got all this gold
from my relatives.

01:04:51.410 --> 01:04:55.500
Then after I became an adult, my mom gave
me this gold.

01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:59.170
When I got this gold as an adult, I looked
through it and on one of these little plates,

01:04:59.170 --> 01:05:00.170
it had my name.

01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:04.680
It had Yang Ging Luen, but the middle character,
Ging, was a different character.

01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:07.070
It sounded the same, but it was a totally
different word.

01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:11.420
I was like, my aunt who gave this to me, she
didn't even know my name.

01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:13.680
She got my name wrong.

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:14.680
My mom said, "No.

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:16.320
She didn't get it wrong.

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:18.360
That was your actual name when you were first
born."

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:19.710
I said, "Okay, so what does this Ging mean?"

01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:23.320
She says, "That Ging means splendid."

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:25.810
I said, "It means splendid?

01:05:25.810 --> 01:05:26.810
You name me Splendid?

01:05:26.810 --> 01:05:27.920
Why did you change that?"

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:33.710
She said, "Well after you turned one and you
started walking around, you kept hitting your

01:05:33.710 --> 01:05:36.210
head.

01:05:36.210 --> 01:05:40.000
We changed it to another Ging, which means
careful."

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.430
That's what my name means now in Chinese.

01:05:44.430 --> 01:05:46.410
It means careful.

01:05:46.410 --> 01:05:47.410
Yes?

01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:50.260
AUDIENCE: How many comics have you made since
you started?

01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:53.610
GENE: So, the question is, how many comics
have I made since I started?

01:05:53.610 --> 01:05:55.470
I have made a lot.

01:05:55.470 --> 01:05:56.640
It's actually kind of hard to count.

01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:58.780
I did 10 issues of Superman.

01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:04.690
I'm working on issue number 13 of New Superman,
so right there I've done 23 issues for DC

01:06:04.690 --> 01:06:05.690
Comics.

01:06:05.690 --> 01:06:07.270
And then for 1st, 2nd, I've done a lot.

01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:09.800
I've maybe done ... I don't know.

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:12.040
12 books now?

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:16.150
Then I have also worked on the Avatar Last
Air Bender comics.

01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:21.030
I did 15 volumes of that so far, so I've done
a lot.

01:06:21.030 --> 01:06:22.030
CARLA: Wow.

01:06:22.030 --> 01:06:32.820
GENE: Yes, young man in the ...
AUDIENCE: What's your favorite book?

01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:33.920
Comic book?

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:41.850
GENE: My favorite book when I was a kid ... I'm
really sad that it's been a little bit forgotten,

01:06:41.850 --> 01:06:44.690
so I want you all to try to read this book
today.

01:06:44.690 --> 01:06:47.650
I love the Book of Three.

01:06:47.650 --> 01:06:50.310
It's a series of books by Lloyd Alexander.

01:06:50.310 --> 01:06:52.910
They were my favorite.

01:06:52.910 --> 01:06:56.620
As a librarian, you must've seen that go out
a lot, right?

01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:57.620
CARLA: Lord.

01:06:57.620 --> 01:06:59.160
GENE: My generation loved that book.

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:01.430
It seems like-
CARLA: It's been lost-

01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:04.310
GENE: It's been a little bit lost-
CARLA: But it's really cool.

01:07:04.310 --> 01:07:06.150
GENE: I'm trying to bring it back.

01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:07.150
CARLA: Good.

01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:08.150
Lloyd Alexander, classic.

01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:09.250
GENE: Yeah, I love Lloyd Alexander.

01:07:09.250 --> 01:07:13.760
Then in terms of comic books, you know March
is a really great comic book.

01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:15.480
You all ought to read that.

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:18.240
There's just a ton of comic books that I love.

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:19.830
I don't know if I could pick one favorite.

01:07:19.830 --> 01:07:22.190
I really do love Mouse, though.

01:07:22.190 --> 01:07:23.950
It's a little bit older.

01:07:23.950 --> 01:07:26.110
It's a non-fiction book about the Holocaust.

01:07:26.110 --> 01:07:31.220
It's a really sad, and heart wrenching book,
but I think it's brilliantly done.

01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:35.310
CARLA: Then I have a question.

01:07:35.310 --> 01:07:36.670
Go ahead.

01:07:36.670 --> 01:07:38.030
GENE: Yes.

01:07:38.030 --> 01:07:45.119
AUDIENCE: What was the first book that the
Library of Congress had in their library?

01:07:45.119 --> 01:07:46.850
GENE: That's a great question.

01:07:46.850 --> 01:07:47.850
Wow!

01:07:47.850 --> 01:07:49.560
I want to know, too.

01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:52.310
CARLA: I don't know.

01:07:52.310 --> 01:07:53.340
The first book.

01:07:53.340 --> 01:08:00.750
There were about two or three hundred books
in 1800.

01:08:00.750 --> 01:08:04.690
The Library was actually part of the capital.

01:08:04.690 --> 01:08:09.660
They had books like the Bible and some other
books that they thought that it would be good-

01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:13.510
Dictionaries and things that they thought
it would be good for Congress.

01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:18.350
Thank you for asking that 'cause I'm gonna
find out, what was the very first book that

01:08:18.350 --> 01:08:20.180
someone purchased for the library.

01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:21.350
GENE: That's great.

01:08:21.350 --> 01:08:24.520
Can you give us some of the highlights of
the collection?

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:26.029
CARLA: Oh my goodness.

01:08:26.029 --> 01:08:27.029
Highlights.

01:08:27.029 --> 01:08:32.259
Well, you have books that go back to the 12th
Century.

01:08:32.259 --> 01:08:39.510
You have the first Bible, right outside here,
that was ever printed with type.

01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:42.060
So the Gutenberg Bible.

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:43.859
That was something- 1500.

01:08:43.859 --> 01:08:50.009
Then you have books that you would call them
"graphic" now.

01:08:50.009 --> 01:08:55.529
Audubon books with the beautiful birds and
all types of things.

01:08:55.529 --> 01:08:56.969
There's so many things.

01:08:56.969 --> 01:08:59.010
That's what's so wonderful about it.

01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:00.870
GENE: Yeah.

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:01.870
It's a magical place.

01:09:01.870 --> 01:09:02.950
You all feel the magic, right?

01:09:02.950 --> 01:09:03.950
Sitting in this room?

01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:06.900
CARLA: Well, we were stomping around.

01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:10.880
GENE: Young man in the red.

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:15.529
AUDIENCE: Earlier you were telling me and
my friends about Frog Man, so-

01:09:15.529 --> 01:09:16.529
GENE: Oh yeah.

01:09:16.529 --> 01:09:17.529
CARLA: Frog Man?

01:09:17.529 --> 01:09:21.799
GENE: Yeah, earlier we were hanging out and
they were asking me what my favorite superhero

01:09:21.799 --> 01:09:22.799
was.

01:09:22.799 --> 01:09:24.410
And Frogman is definitely one of my favorite
superheroes.

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:28.020
He's an obscure character from the Marvel
universe.

01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:33.839
He doesn't have any super powers; he just
wears a costume that makes him look like a

01:09:33.839 --> 01:09:34.839
frog.

01:09:34.839 --> 01:09:44.250
So, his whole thing is this; he is the son
of a super villain named the "Leap Frog",

01:09:44.250 --> 01:09:47.450
who would use his frog suit to go and rob
banks.

01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:52.190
Then he finds out that his dad is this criminal
and he feels really bad about it, so he steals

01:09:52.190 --> 01:09:56.120
the suit from his dad and becomes a superhero
called "Frog Man".

01:09:56.120 --> 01:10:00.280
CARLA: And his super powers are?
GENE: His super powers, at the bottom of his

01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:03.720
suit, on each of his feet, are giant springs.

01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:07.740
He can just jump around and that's his whole
power.

01:10:07.740 --> 01:10:09.110
Yeah.

01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:12.210
CARLA: I'm learning a lot.

01:10:12.210 --> 01:10:14.330
It's good.

01:10:14.330 --> 01:10:16.450
GENE: Yep?

01:10:16.450 --> 01:10:22.082
AUDIENCE: Do you write and illustrate your
books, or does somebody else do it?

01:10:22.082 --> 01:10:23.260
GENE: Do I write and illustrate my books?

01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:24.500
It depends on the book.

01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:27.885
So, there are some books where I do both the
writing and the drawing, and there are other

01:10:27.885 --> 01:10:30.740
books where I only do the writing and somebody
else does the drawing.

01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:32.800
I work with a friend of mine who does the
drawing.

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:34.630
So it depends on the book.

01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:37.920
CARLA: Do we have time for a couple more questions?

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:38.920
One more question.

01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:39.920
Oh my.

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:41.140
GENE: One more question.

01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:42.140
Okay.

01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:45.020
How about the young lady with the sunglasses?

01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:49.090
AUDIENCE: Do you prefer Marvel or DC Comics?

01:10:49.090 --> 01:10:52.960
GENE: I'd like to hear your- Do you have an
answer to this, Dr. Hayden?

01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:53.960
CARLA: No.

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:55.790
I'm just getting into it.

01:10:55.790 --> 01:11:03.420
Between Frog Man, Jeff the Weirdo, and some
of the others, I have to start reading and

01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:05.540
this is gonna be my Reading Without Walls.

01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:09.220
I'm gonna get into real comic books.

01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:10.220
That's my pledge.

01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:11.350
GENE: I'm gonna have to send you some.

01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:17.000
CARLA: I'm going to read, and this is my reading
challenge and it's gonna be fun 'cause I'm

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.130
a go in the comic store.

01:11:18.130 --> 01:11:20.650
They're gonna say, "What is she doing in here?"

01:11:20.650 --> 01:11:26.910
I'm a go in the comic store and I'm a pick
out some Marvel comics- Any suggestions besides-

01:11:26.910 --> 01:11:28.090
GENE: From Marvel Comics?

01:11:28.090 --> 01:11:29.130
Ms. Marvel.

01:11:29.130 --> 01:11:32.510
Ms. Marvel is great.

01:11:32.510 --> 01:11:39.760
Yeah, it's the ... It's a Muslim American
young girl who has the power to make any part

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:42.050
of her body as big or as small as she wants.

01:11:42.050 --> 01:11:43.050
CARLA: I can use that.

01:11:43.050 --> 01:11:44.050
GENE: She makes it super big.

01:11:44.050 --> 01:11:45.050
It's awesome.

01:11:45.050 --> 01:11:46.050
CARLA: Or super small?

01:11:46.050 --> 01:11:47.050
GENE: Then Totally Awesome Hulk.

01:11:47.050 --> 01:11:48.230
That's another one.

01:11:48.230 --> 01:11:50.750
CARLA: Okay, and then DC Comics?

01:11:50.750 --> 01:11:54.250
GENE: Then DC, Batgirl is amazing.

01:11:54.250 --> 01:11:55.250
It's awesome.

01:11:55.250 --> 01:11:57.840
Batgirl is a wonderful comic, and Supergirl
is also a wonderful comic.

01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:58.840
CARLA: Okay.

01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:00.100
Do they have any librarian comic characters?

01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:03.020
GENE: Are there any librarian comic characters?

01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:09.670
There was one called The Answer, which is
about a librarian who becomes best friends

01:12:09.670 --> 01:12:10.670
with a superhero.

01:12:10.670 --> 01:12:13.250
CARLA: I'm a look for that one, too.

01:12:13.250 --> 01:12:14.770
That's my Reading Without Walls.

01:12:14.770 --> 01:12:18.910
I pledge that I will go and get some real
comics.

01:12:18.910 --> 01:12:19.910
GENE: That's great.

01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:25.210
CARLA: My question for you too, when we talk
about graphic novels, what about non-fiction.

01:12:25.210 --> 01:12:26.950
What do you call them?

01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:29.280
Because a novel seems to be fiction.

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:30.280
GENE: Yes.

01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:33.650
CARLA: A book like March is a graphic book?

01:12:33.650 --> 01:12:36.150
GENE: Yeah, I agree.

01:12:36.150 --> 01:12:40.950
To answer that young lady's question, for
me, nowadays because I write for DC I'm kind

01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:41.950
of a DC guy.

01:12:41.950 --> 01:12:46.110
But when I was a kid, when I was your age,
I read more Marvel than DC.

01:12:46.110 --> 01:12:49.190
The term "graphic novel" is a little bit clumsy,
right?

01:12:49.190 --> 01:12:52.900
We use it to describe things that actually
aren't novels at all like March.

01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:54.550
March is ...
CARLA: It's real.

01:12:54.550 --> 01:12:57.910
GENE: It's not a novel, it's non-fiction.

01:12:57.910 --> 01:12:59.360
It's an autobiography.

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:03.430
The New York Times deals with this by calling
them "graphic books" instead of graphic novels,

01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:09.510
but I do think that the term graphic novel,
even though it's a little bit weird, it refers

01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:10.660
to a publishing format.

01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:15.460
CARLA: Okay, rather than what type of-
GENE: Rather than what type, yes.

01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:16.670
CARLA: Okay.

01:13:16.670 --> 01:13:17.670
GENE: All right.

01:13:17.670 --> 01:13:19.560
It looks like we're just about out of time.

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:21.233
I want to thank all of you who are in this
room-

01:13:21.233 --> 01:13:22.233
CARLA: Thank you.

01:13:22.233 --> 01:13:23.960
GENE: And those of you who are joining us
through the cameras.

01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:26.510
Thank you so much for being here.

01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:29.420
It was wonderful to talk to you all.

01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:30.420
Thank you.

01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:31.960
Thank you all so much.

01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:35.920
CARLA: Now who gets to take Jeff the Weirdo
home?

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:39.170
GENE: How are we gonna decide that?

01:13:39.170 --> 01:13:40.170
CARLA: I don't know.

01:13:40.170 --> 01:13:44.360
How do you do that, where you do a thing and
