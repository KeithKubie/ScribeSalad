00:00:01.376 --> 00:00:02.544
- All right, smiths.

00:00:02.544 --> 00:00:04.254
Welcome to our strength test.

00:00:04.254 --> 00:00:06.339
The ammo can stab and chop.

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:09.843
But what your blades do to
the cans, I don't really care.

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:11.803
I want to see what the cans
are going to do to your blades.

00:00:11.803 --> 00:00:13.096
John, I know you're
ready for this, right?

00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:13.930
Rock and roll.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.724
Let's do it.

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:18.560
JON: My heart is going 1,000
miles an hour right now.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.395
The only thing I'm really
worried about is that guard.

00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:23.148
I didn't get as solid a
fit up as I wanted to.

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:24.190
That guard is a
little bit sloppy.

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:29.279
[music playing]

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.113
Yeah, boy.

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:47.714
China's a beast.

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:50.049
But it's actually a
fairly comfortable beast.

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:53.136
The leather behind
the guard, I mean,

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:55.805
it's still there but
it makes it move a bit.

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:58.933
But there's no cracking.

00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:01.144
There's no huge chunks
taken out of it.

00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:03.188
Everything's tight.

00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:03.897
Nicely done.

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:04.731
Thank you.

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:05.982
All right, Mike.

00:01:05.982 --> 00:01:06.733
What's the Marine
Corps got to say?

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:07.734
Do this.

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:08.401
Let's do it.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.405
MIKE: I am very nervous.

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:13.782
Jon just went.

00:01:13.782 --> 00:01:15.867
His blade dented that
can up really nice.

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:19.245
My turn.
Let's do this.

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:22.081
[music playing]

00:01:34.052 --> 00:01:35.553
Good boy.

00:01:35.553 --> 00:01:36.930
All right, Mike.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.557
Some handle things, it's
a very large handle.

00:01:39.557 --> 00:01:41.893
That being said, with this big
chunk of brass on the back,

00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:45.063
I was able to generate a
lot of force in that stab.

00:01:45.063 --> 00:01:48.191
Only problem is, we did
take a bit of your tip off

00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:49.609
in the stab.

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:52.153
Except for a few little
chips and a snapped tip,

00:01:52.153 --> 00:01:53.446
you still got a good edge there.

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:54.155
Good job.

00:01:54.155 --> 00:01:57.116
Thank you.

00:01:57.116 --> 00:01:58.159
You can breath, brother.

00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:58.952
Breath now.

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:00.829
You breath now.

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:01.746
Jim, I know you're ready.

00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:03.456
Always.

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:06.501
JIM: I'm feeling pretty good
about going into testing.

00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:08.294
My blade's something
the size that I

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:09.337
would have used in Vietnam.

00:02:12.257 --> 00:02:15.593
[music playing]

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:35.155
Well, we've got a
couple issues, Jim.

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:37.490
The big issue is your edge here.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.286
On those three chops, the
can kind of won on that one.

00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:45.915
I think your edge got too
thin when you were grinding.

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:50.003
But otherwise, it's all
tight, nothing blew apart.

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:51.546
Nicely done.
- Thank you.

00:02:51.546 --> 00:02:54.591
Good job.

00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:57.594
Bladesmiths, this
is the sharpness test.

00:02:57.594 --> 00:02:59.762
The resupply bundle slice.

00:02:59.762 --> 00:03:01.014
Jon, you're up first.
You're ready?

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:03.099
Let's do it.
DOUG: Let's do this.

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.977
[music playing]

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:23.786
All right, Jon.

00:03:23.786 --> 00:03:27.790
It's a big blade but it's evenly
balanced all the way through.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.001
Overall, it will cut.

00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:31.794
Thank you, sir.

00:03:31.794 --> 00:03:33.838
That's I wanted to hear.

00:03:33.838 --> 00:03:34.672
All right, Mike.

00:03:34.672 --> 00:03:35.548
You ready?

00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:36.466
Let's make this happen.

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:37.717
DOUG: Let's do this.

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:41.054
[music playing]

00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:02.200
Mike, let's talk
about your blade.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.910
First up, I love the balance.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.119
It feels good.

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:08.581
And as you can
see, it cut easily.

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:09.415
It will cut.

00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:10.500
Thank you.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.543
DOUG: Good job.
All right, Jim.

00:04:12.543 --> 00:04:13.753
Your turn.
You ready?

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:15.004
Let's do it.
DOUG: Let's do this.

00:04:15.004 --> 00:04:17.924
During the ammo
can chop I lost

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:20.510
several pieces of the blade.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.805
I'm really hoping at
least I can cut something.

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:27.016
[music playing]

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:32.689
This is not good.

00:04:40.738 --> 00:04:41.739
All right, Jim.

00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:42.782
Let's talk about your blade.

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:44.492
The handle itself feels good.

00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:46.786
Of all the blades,
this is very light.

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:48.371
In the swing, it feels good.

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:50.415
It's got a good
balance to it but you

00:04:50.415 --> 00:04:52.875
are missing chips right there
off the metal right there.

00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:56.170
It is just not sharp enough
to cut through the cord.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.171
I understand.
