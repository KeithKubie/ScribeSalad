Age thinkers and I would more or less

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269
Age thinkers and I would more or less
 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.529
Age thinkers and I would more or less
put Joseph Campbell in that category I

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.519
think you can find what compels you and

think you can find what compels you and
 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.970
think you can find what compels you and
what might enable you to live in a high

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980
what might enable you to live in a high
 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.919

that's associated with life I think you

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640
that's associated with life I think you
 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.310
that's associated with life I think you
can discover that and I think part of

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320
can discover that and I think part of
 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.740
can discover that and I think part of
the way you discover that is by watching

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750
the way you discover that is by watching
 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.010
the way you discover that is by watching
yourself and learning when it is that

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020
yourself and learning when it is that
 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.450
yourself and learning when it is that
you're meaningfully engaged you have to

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460
you're meaningfully engaged you have to
 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.630
you're meaningfully engaged you have to
notice that it's something that happens

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640
notice that it's something that happens
 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.920
notice that it's something that happens
to you in some sense rather than

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930
to you in some sense rather than
 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.100
to you in some sense rather than
something that you do you have to notice

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110
something that you do you have to notice
 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.689
something that you do you have to notice
when you're meaningfully engaged and

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699
when you're meaningfully engaged and
 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.869
when you're meaningfully engaged and
then you have to work to expand the

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879
then you have to work to expand the
 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.939
then you have to work to expand the
amount of time that you spend in that

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949
amount of time that you spend in that
 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.939
amount of time that you spend in that
state but I would also say that there

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949
state but I would also say that there
 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.650
state but I would also say that there
are moral requirements that go along

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660
are moral requirements that go along
 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.240
are moral requirements that go along
with that too because you might say well

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250
with that too because you might say well
 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.039
with that too because you might say well
what if you happen to be this sort of

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049
what if you happen to be this sort of
 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.890
what if you happen to be this sort of
person for example who finds torturing

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900
person for example who finds torturing
 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.510
person for example who finds torturing
small animals meaningfully engaging it

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520
small animals meaningfully engaging it
 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.700
small animals meaningfully engaging it
seems like that's a that's the sort of

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710
seems like that's a that's the sort of
 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.200
seems like that's a that's the sort of
meaningful engagement that you probably

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210
meaningful engagement that you probably
 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.320
meaningful engagement that you probably
don't want to expand so I would say that

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330
don't want to expand so I would say that
 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.359
don't want to expand so I would say that
if you're going to set up your life so

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369
if you're going to set up your life so
 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.830
if you're going to set up your life so
that you maximize your meaningful

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840
that you maximize your meaningful
 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.020
that you maximize your meaningful
engagement you have to there's a number

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030
engagement you have to there's a number
 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.520
engagement you have to there's a number
of other things that you have to do at

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530
of other things that you have to do at
 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.679
of other things that you have to do at
the same time and one of those is that

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689
the same time and one of those is that
 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.580
the same time and one of those is that
you have to get very clear about who you

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590
you have to get very clear about who you
 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.260
you have to get very clear about who you
are and what you're doing and so

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270
are and what you're doing and so
 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.450
are and what you're doing and so
although this would be grounds for a

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460
although this would be grounds for a
 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.730
although this would be grounds for a
much longer discussion I think that one

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740
much longer discussion I think that one
 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.200
much longer discussion I think that one
of the things that you have to do if

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210
of the things that you have to do if
 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.039
of the things that you have to do if
you're going to attempt to maximize

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049
you're going to attempt to maximize
 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.300
you're going to attempt to maximize
meaningful engagement is that you also

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310
meaningful engagement is that you also
 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.569
meaningful engagement is that you also
have to do such things as endeavor to

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579
have to do such things as endeavor to
 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.730
have to do such things as endeavor to
stop deceiving yourself and other people

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740
stop deceiving yourself and other people
 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.870
stop deceiving yourself and other people
in every way you possibly can and part

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880
in every way you possibly can and part
 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.370
in every way you possibly can and part
of the reason for that is that if you

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380
of the reason for that is that if you
 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.480
of the reason for that is that if you
engage in deception of any sort you

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490
engage in deception of any sort you
 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.279
engage in deception of any sort you
pathologize the structure first the

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289
pathologize the structure first the
 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.990
pathologize the structure first the
structure of your being but you could

structure of your being but you could
 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.800
structure of your being but you could
say you pathologies the structure

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810
say you pathologies the structure
 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.930
say you pathologies the structure
your nervous system and then you can't

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940
your nervous system and then you can't
 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.620
your nervous system and then you can't
trust its reports so if your nerd if

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630
trust its reports so if your nerd if
 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.970
trust its reports so if your nerd if
you're going to rely on your nervous

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980
you're going to rely on your nervous

you're going to rely on your nervous
systems reports of meaningful engagement

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780
systems reports of meaningful engagement

to guide your future activities you

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180
to guide your future activities you
 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.059
to guide your future activities you
better do everything you can to make

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069
better do everything you can to make
 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.470
better do everything you can to make
sure that you're not filling that

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480
sure that you're not filling that
 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.390
sure that you're not filling that
nervous system with the kind of garbage

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400
nervous system with the kind of garbage
 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.250
nervous system with the kind of garbage
that's going to make it malfunction and

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260
that's going to make it malfunction and
 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.920
that's going to make it malfunction and

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930
give again give you false reports so I

think that moving towards meaningful

think that moving towards meaningful
 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.770
think that moving towards meaningful
engagement has to be associated with

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780
engagement has to be associated with
 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.870
engagement has to be associated with
making truth your highest value because

your own guide I mean the Catholics have

your own guide I mean the Catholics have
struggled with this for a long time from

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150
struggled with this for a long time from
 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.759
struggled with this for a long time from
a theological perspective because the

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769
a theological perspective because the
 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.190
a theological perspective because the
Catholic position roughly speaking is

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200
Catholic position roughly speaking is
 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.140
Catholic position roughly speaking is
that human beings are so steeped in sin

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150
that human beings are so steeped in sin
 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.960
that human beings are so steeped in sin
that they can't trust their own

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970
that they can't trust their own
 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.190
that they can't trust their own
instincts in relationship to good and

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200
instincts in relationship to good and
 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.589
instincts in relationship to good and
evil and have to use the church and the

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599
evil and have to use the church and the
 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.520
evil and have to use the church and the
priesthood as an intermediary and you

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530
priesthood as an intermediary and you
 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.860
priesthood as an intermediary and you
know you can obviously have an argument

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870
know you can obviously have an argument
 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.080
know you can obviously have an argument
about that and of course Protestants

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090
about that and of course Protestants
 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.759
about that and of course Protestants
have historically done that but you got

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769
have historically done that but you got
 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.520
have historically done that but you got
to give the Catholics their do it's like

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530
to give the Catholics their do it's like
 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.830
to give the Catholics their do it's like
people aren't pure by nature and only

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840
people aren't pure by nature and only
 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.900
people aren't pure by nature and only
trammeled in their vision by you know

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910
trammeled in their vision by you know
 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.699
trammeled in their vision by you know
sociological impediments they're also

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709
sociological impediments they're also
 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.920
sociological impediments they're also
corrupt beyond belief individually and

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930
corrupt beyond belief individually and
 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.890
corrupt beyond belief individually and
have to use society as a source of value

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900
have to use society as a source of value
