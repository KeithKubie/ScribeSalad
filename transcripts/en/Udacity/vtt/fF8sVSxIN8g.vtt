HTTP is a stateless protocol,
each request is its own TCP connection.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.840
For example,
if you log into your bank's website,

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.660
each click on a URL generates
a separate TCP connection.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.270
In order to carry information
across multiple HTTP requests

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.160
such as user authentication,
cookies are used.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.950
A cookie is created by the web server
when the user first logs into the site.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.420
It contains not only user identity
information, but also security

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.310
information such as access,
expiration time, and if SSL is required.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:44.080
The user's browser stores the cookie and
includes it in subsequent requests so

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.440
that the server knows that
these new requests are related.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.270
For example, they belong to
the same user login session.
