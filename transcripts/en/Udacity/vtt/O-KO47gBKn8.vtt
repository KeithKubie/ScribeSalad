00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.699
So today we've talked about
one particular method for

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:04.688
doing what's called
incremental concept learning.

00:00:04.688 --> 00:00:07.566
We started by talking about why we
need incremental concept learning.

00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:10.900
We have instances in the world where we
encounter a limited number of examples.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.110
We need to discern a concept
based on those limited examples.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.970
So we start by variablizing our current
understanding to arrive at a more

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.020
abstract notion of the concept.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.880
Then based on new positive or negative
examples, we either generalize or

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.850
specialize our understanding.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.540
We talked about a few heuristics for
doing this, like the forbid link or

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.990
require link heuristics.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.265
That allow us to develop a better
concept based on new examples.

00:00:31.265 --> 00:00:33.925
Next we'll talk about classification
where we leverage the concepts

00:00:33.925 --> 00:00:36.125
that we developed through
incremental concept learning.

00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:38.575
But we'll also revisit incremental
concept learning in some later lessons

00:00:38.575 --> 00:00:41.555
as well such as through version spaces,
explanation based learning,

00:00:41.555 --> 00:00:43.245
and learning by correcting mistakes.
