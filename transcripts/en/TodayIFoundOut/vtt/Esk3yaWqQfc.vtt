00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.710
This isn’t just a popular metaphor, it’s
actually true.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.690
One bad apple will absolutely quickly spoil
an entire box of apples.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.610
The obvious way this can happen is simply
if one of the apples is infested with some

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.930
fungi or critters that reproduce and spread
throughout all the apples in a box, ruining

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.130
them as they go.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.160
The less obvious, but perhaps even more common,
way this can happen has to do with a hydrocarbon

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.730
chemical known as ethylene.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.320
Ethylene is a hormone produced and released
into the air by most plants, including from

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.550
the fruit of certain plants, such as apples,
bananas, pears, etc.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.090
So what does this have to do with one “bad”
apple?

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.750
The “bad” apple is usually one that is
wounded in some way or is otherwise overripe.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.001
As a consequence to the wound on the apple,
or if it’s just already very ripe, the apple

00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:00.579
in question will give off significantly more
ethylene than normal.

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.350
That ethylene accelerates the ripening process
in the apples around it, which causes them

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.390
to give off more ethylene, further accelerating
the ripening process in all the apples in

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.390
the box.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.240
In very short order, the entire box of apples
will be overripe and eventually unpalatable

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.240
for eating.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.479
Humans have actually been using ethylene to
control ripening processes since before we

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:23.579
knew about the hormone.

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:27.909
The first known instance of this was in ancient
Egypt where they would slash figs and place

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.469
them with other fruits and vegetables in order
to accelerate the ripening process, with the

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:36.369
wound stimulating the production of relatively
large amounts of ethylene.

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.409
Today, ethylene is popularly used by banana
distributors to partially ripen the fruit

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.899
before the final distribution to stores.

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.049
Bananas are picked when they are quite green
and hard.

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.090
They are shipped this way to allow them to
be in transit for longer periods, as well

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.280
as reduce the chances of bruising during transport.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.069
Once they are at the local distribution warehouses,
they are often exposed to ethylene gas in

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:02.009
a closed chamber for 24-48 hours to drastically
accelerate the ripening process, making them

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.740
ready for store shelves.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.369
Even if un-wounded, bananas put off large
amounts of ethylene relative to many other

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.369
fruits.

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.690
In fact, if you’d like to speed up the ripening
of some green bananas or other fruit or vegetables,

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.930
put them in a paper bag together overnight.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.900
The trapped ethylene will quickly ripen the
fruit, and the paper bag will still let enough

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.150
oxygen in to keep the ripening process going
smoothly.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.780
On the same token, putting fresh bananas in
the same container as an overripe banana will

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.950
drastically accelerate the ripening process
of the fresh bananas, which is already quite

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:33.950
a fast process.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.970
On the flipside, if you want to slow the ripening
of bananas, put them in the refrigerator.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.390
Contrary to what you might think from seeing
the bananas rapidly turn to brown and then

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.470
black when placed in a refrigerator, this
drastically slows the internal ripening process

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.470
of the fruit.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.030
The skin will look like the banana is rotten,
but the inside will stay tasty for up to about

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.030
a week.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.810
So wait until a hand of bananas reaches the
perfect ripeness, then plop them in your fridge

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.070
to lock them in that state for about a week.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.000
No more bothering with the tiny window of
eating opportunity normally presented by bananas

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:28.950
left on the kitchen counter.
