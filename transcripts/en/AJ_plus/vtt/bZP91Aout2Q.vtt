00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
When Puerto Rico was suddenly 
on everyone’s minds after Hurricane Maria,

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.280
one question kept coming up:

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.920
What does it mean to be a U.S. territory?

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.200
Puerto Rico is just one of many U.S. territories,

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.540
including the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands and Guam.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.820
But many Americans hardly ever think about them.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.660
"Most members of Congress, they
couldn't find Guam on a map –

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.980
and they don't want to

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.060
because it's completely off their radar."

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.280
The 4 million Americans who live in these territories

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.920
can serve in the military,

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.780
but they can’t vote for president.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:41.080
Each territory has one representative in Congress, 
but that representative can’t actually vote, either.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.560
U.S. territories are essentially,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.940
American colonies.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.480
"There's a footnote attached to America's empire,

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.560
and it's called Guam."

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.640
Way out in the western Pacific,

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.520
this island of 160,000 people 
is the furthest west you can get

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.080
and still say you’re on American soil.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.940
And since it’s close to Asia,

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.440
it’s the perfect location for a U.S. military base,

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.480
which is why the military controls more 
than a quarter of the island’s land.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.860
In this series of “Untold America,”

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.800
I’m going to take you to Guam.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.860
I want to know how it became and stayed a U.S. colony.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.580
Driving around Guam

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.960
you can’t miss that this is America.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.220
You can hear planes taking off 
from Andersen Air Force Base,

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.440
tourists shoot guns at Wild West-style ranges

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.720
and snap photos in front of a 
replica of the Statue of Liberty.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.000
But like the other territories,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.440
Guam is not fully American.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.860
"Since Guam is considered a possession of the U.S.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.860
but not part of the U.S.,

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.200
the Constitution doesn't apply,

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.520
and so even today, we still do not have 
the full applicability of the Constitution."

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.080
That’s because of a series of 
decisions called the “Insular Cases.”

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.520
"So the U.S. Supreme Court,

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.640
the highest court in the land, 
basically in 1901 decides that based on race,

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.820
based on this idea that these places 
are populated by quote, “alien races” –

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.260
the Constitution wouldn't be applied.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.300
Basically, alien races are incapable of 
understanding Anglo-Saxon principles."

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.340
In Guam’s case, by “alien races”

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.640
they meant the indigenous Chamorro people,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.580
who have lived on the island for more than 3,000 years.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.580
Before the Americans came in,

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.260
Guam had already been colonized 
for hundreds of years by the Spanish.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.340
Then, with the Treaty of Paris in 1898,

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.000
the United States took control of Guam,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.960
the Philippines and Puerto Rico.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.200
"Now, when they took Guam,

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.760
they declared the entire island 
to be the naval station of Guam.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.020
And what that would mean for the Chamorro people

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.500
was that the military ruled our lives.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.200
And there was no consideration of 
civil rights for the people, political rights.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.060
It became a dictatorship."

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.720
The Chamorro people were denied the right to citizenship and banned from speaking their language.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.480
This continued for decades until…

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.740
“The United States of America was 
suddenly and deliberately attacked

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.420
by naval and air forces of the empire of Japan.”

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.920
Just hours after the bombing of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii in December 1941,

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.840
the Japanese also bombed Guam.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:27.780
"They had actually evacuated all of the 
white wives and children to the mainland.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.760
Because they were expecting 
the Japanese to bomb the island.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.300
Right. And, uh, and I mentioned white wives and children

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.020
because they didn't evacuate the Chamorro women who had been married to Americans."

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.740
The Japanese occupied Guam for 
two and a half years during the war.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.200
It was a really traumatic 
time for Chamorros on the island.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.540
I wanted to hear from people who lived through it.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.000
During occupation, many women 
were assaulted by Japanese soldiers.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.360
Susie was one of them.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.620
Susie was able to get away, but still 
has a scar on her knee from the attack.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.100
She lost four siblings and an aunt during the war.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.920
"I’m half-Japanese.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.280
My mom is from Japan, and 
I lived there for a number of years.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.280
I’m also American.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.400
I never learned these stories growing up.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.220
I didn’t know any of these stories growing up."

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.680
During the Japanese occupation,

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.420
Chamorro people were forced to work 
the fields to produce food for the Japanese.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.200
Toward the end of the war, 
the Japanese became more brutal,

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.200
killing Chamorros en masse and 
rounding them up into concentration camps.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.460
Susie's aunt died on the march to one of the concentration camps when she couldn't keep up.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.100
She was beaten and thrown into a ditch.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.740
"The largest massacre, which 
happened in the northern part of Guam in Yigo,

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.340
there were 45 men who were beheaded.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.020
Just one day after another, there 
are a number of massacres that go on,

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.900
30 people, 45 people, 
all the way leading up to Liberation Day."

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:24.620
“For 17 days, without let-up, American 
planes and ships assault the island of Guam.”

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.840
"For people who were there at the time,

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.300
you can understand the,

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.880
the relief, the excitement,

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.720
the sense actually of liberation, of freedom."

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.380
"People felt safe that the United States is back."

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.180
(Laughs) "I was so happy."

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.140
"We were really blessed."

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:49.700
"Dear Uncle Sam, won’t you please come back to Guam?

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.160
Hey!" (Laughs).

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:58.240
I started to understand why a lot of people on Guam, especially the older generation, are so patriotic.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.440
But after the war,

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.100
Chamorros were moved into refugee camps and the military began taking land all over the island.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.640
"The property to the left, 
all the way practically to the ocean,

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.400
is my family's property,

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:16.100
and what the military 
did is they just took it from us."

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:21.940
Antonio’s family was forced to sign over 
4,600 acres of their land to the U.S. military.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.480
He says they were paid less than $12 an acre for it.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.280
That land became Andersen Air Force Base.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.920
Less than 10 years later,

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.040
the military took another 
1,000 acres from the Sablan family

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.580
to create the Naval Communications Station.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.520
"There were 200,000 military on the island,

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:46.480
and the U.S. military had just basically gobbled up vast amounts of land,

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.460
probably close to 70% at its peak,

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:55.300
over 100 installations all over the island, it's just every branch of the military was here."

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.320
Chamorros who had just survived a brutal war,

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.060
were coerced into signing over their land by threats,

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.320
the need to prove their 
patriotism and fear of military backlash.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:10.400
On average, the military paid only $1 an acre for the land.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.600
"Chamorros were feeling completely powerless.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.360
It was gut-wrenching.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.760
Land was all they had.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.960
Literally land was their wealth.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.160
Land was what they gave to 
their children and grandchildren.

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.460
As a result of liberation,

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:27.660
the Chamorros become landless 
and many of them become homeless,

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.800
and the Chamorros become the poor people of Guam."

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.020
After decades of fighting for 
their rights under American rule

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.640
Chamorros were given limited 
citizenship under the Organic Act.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.240
Now that they were citizens,

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:43.280
the military was legally required to make an official payment for the land they took.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.080
But that didn’t mean the payment was fair.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:52.100
Antonio’s family got a single dollar for all 
4,600 acres taken to create the air force base.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.780
"Almost everybody in Guam,

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.760
pretty much we got nothing.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:01.200
Very little and compensation is just so unjust."

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:08.160
Antonio, who had served in the military himself, did inherit a small bit of land, but throughout the 80s,

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.100
the military made it very difficult for him to access it.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:17.360
"I literally get accosted at gunpoint 
numerous times when I am in my family's land.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.720
Like a barrel of an M16 on the back of my neck,

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.380
laying on the ground

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:27.240
because they're trying to identify whether 
I’m a properly legitimate person to be there."

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.080
“Even though you had an ID card 
that said you were a landowner?”

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:31.840
“That’s correct.”

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:37.320
“That’s why I became so outspoken and radical,

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:43.480
because what am I doing identifying myself on 
my own home to go to my own private property?”

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.240
Antonio helped form the group Nasion Chamoru,

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:51.340
also known as  Chamorro Nation, 
to protest the military occupation of Guam.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.140
“So we were blocking the road.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.880
“We actually put a tent in the middle of the road.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.340
They would, they all tie us in like handcuff,

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.580
and there would be a bus parked up ahead

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:06.180
and they would take us and put us inside the bus.”

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:07.840
As a result of the protests,

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.860
the guard shack that checked IDs on that road was eventually taken down.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:13.200
“I was willing to go to jail.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:17.880
I was willing to confront the 
Americanos and die if I have to.”

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:24.680
In the 80s, after hundreds of Chamorros filed claims over the unfair original payments for their land,

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:27.340
the U.S. government agreed to pay up.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:31.120
But they paid what the land was worth in the 1940s --

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.680
40 years too late.

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:37.380
The Sablan family chose not to 
accept the payment in protest.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:42.440
Today, Antonio runs a tourism 
business with some of the land he has left.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.460
But of the 5,500 acres his family once owned

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:50.620
that became military property, none were ever returned.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.540
“I am the victim.

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.700
They're the one that's enjoying the fruits of our land.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:01.220
And they should be paying us 
billions of dollars in rent money

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:06.460
for utilizing as the most important 
military outpost here in the Pacific.”

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.880
With Andersen Air Force Base to the 
north and the naval base to the south,

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:15.120
the U.S. military now controls 27% of the land on Guam.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.300
Because of Guam’s complicated past,

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.520
I can understand how the legacy of liberation lives on.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.860
But while patriotism on the island is still strong,

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:27.040
there are people who are 
pushing back against the military.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.360
They say it’s time for Guam,

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.720
an American colony,

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.420
to choose its own fate.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.400
Thanks so much for watching part 1 of our series.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:40.300
I can’t believe I never learned about the brutal history of

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.340
Japanese occupation on Guam in school.

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.760
In this next video, we’re going to go speak to people in

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.360
the military who can’t even vote for president.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.900
And we’re going to go talk to people in the

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:49.900
independence movement.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.760
