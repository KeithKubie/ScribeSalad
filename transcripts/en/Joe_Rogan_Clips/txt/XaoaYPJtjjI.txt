Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah. And so now he's, uh, he's in, uh, uh, an Alzheimer's home. But, but uh, yeah, that's the part about is it scary about turning 50? But he's like in, they're nailing all these chicks we call, we will go in there and he's like making out with some girl with a nasal cannula on and carrying her oxygen bottle and he's convinced that they've been married for a few dead. I have a bit in my act about the outbreak of STDs in nursing homes. It's out of control. Viagara oh, it's not only just that, these people, I mean, I mean my dad has really advanced Alzheimer's, um, and he knows that he misses his Mustang. Uh, I took all this bicycles away and I need to get laid. That's it. I mean, and he's in there just running around with it. If we got called to my sister and I take care of my dad in that manner. And so we get called to the, uh, home, almost like being called to the principal's office as a, as a parent. And they're like, your dad's literally in here. Fucking everybody.

Speaker 2:          01:10          Like,

Speaker 1:          01:13          yeah. Literally had the feeling of getting janked in there to the, to the principal's office. Like your kids a fuck up. Your Dad's fucking every but yeah, it'd be proud. Oh heck yeah. What does he care? What do you all care? That's my point. That's what I say about him in my acts. Like, come on man. How do you want these people die out? What? Their heart to stop with the playing. Bingo. Yeah. Yeah. Have a good time. Just don't want him hurt each other. We'll see. I mean the, I'm in the healthcare business also home health care and so I know, yeah, I've got a lot of different ventures. But what do you in, how are you in the home health care? Home health care with, uh, with, uh, my wife, uh, we 16, 17 years, um, maybe longer. Uh, so in the state of Texas it's probably the second or third largest home health care, but I'm talking real home healthcare.

Speaker 1:          02:00          Like you've got to get shots, you've got to get therapy. You got, these are Aryans that are going in and they're not, so you go into bathe grandma, what is your business? So you hire a bunch of nurses to take care of the people that are at home. Yeah, it's prescribed, uh, like through Medicare or insurance or whatever to where maybe somebody gets a knee or a shoulder replacement or maybe it's an injury or cancer or what have you. And so it's a very rewarding business. We probably have 3000 to 2,500, 3000 patients at any given time all around the state of Texas. And uh, so it's, uh, it's, it's a fun business to be and that you're really getting help people, but at the same time, this shit out there crazy. These guys are, they're getting after it. You go into the nursing home and it's like Dan do this 78 year old Jews had more ass than I had

Speaker 2:          02:49          last week.

Speaker 1:          02:53          Well, you don't have anything else to do. Nothing. Yeah. Why not? Why not? Why not? My thought is why not? Well, I bought my dad, uh, you know, he's got his room. That's kind of like an apartment or whatever. And I bought him strip stripper sheets, or not stripper sheets, but uh, uh, uh, twister, twister sheets with the all the bread and polluted peak times. And I hung a board thing up behind his bed. I'm like, Dad, if you're getting after you might as well have fun. I mean fuck Bingo or freaking whatever. So when, because he has Alzheimer's, does he remember when he gets after it? I think it's cities just so focused on, and he says he was the, what would you call him? A Casa Nueva or he was, he, my dad got some serious ass my whole life as a teenager. I was like, God Dang it.

Speaker 1:          03:36          My Dad's like banging everything and tense when your wife leaves you with kids, when you're young, you just realize, okay, I forgot about this longterm shit. Yeah, let's just enjoy the moment. Yeah. But I mean, my dad was straight up products of the sixties and seventies, you know, so he, he like put dye his hair blonde and his eyebrows blonde and shit and walk around, look at like Matthew mcconaughey from dazed and confused. All right. All right. All right. Try driving his Mustang. You know, he'd come pick me up from school. What kind of Mustang did you have back then? It was like a 72 fast back, you know, red and black with a four speed and he'd be hammering it and I'm like, you know, five, six years old at the age I'd fall on the floor because nobody wore a freaking seatbelt back then. And uh, his idea of after school care was the skating rink because he knew that thing. It'd be open till nine. So drop us off. I'm at the skating rink eating 99 cent corn dog meal and uh, he'd come pick us up usually around 10 or 11 with some irate skating rink owners sitting there pissed off. And he said, wow, he was a bad ass though. Or is a bad ass still? I mean, he's nailing chicks in a freaking nursing home. Come on.

Speaker 1:          04:46          It's so weird when you become an adult, isn't it? Oh yeah. You know, when you think about [inaudible] round for what we're doing, we've got a drink wine from Arabian Rawlings for sure. Raymond Rawlings, Raymond Miller, Rawlings, that his mother fucker that ever lived. So I loop for sure. I mean, I guarantee you he got more acid than you and I did this whole week. I believe it. He's freaking probably banging one right now. Yeah. It's like, hey, what's that noise in the back? Sounds like my son is the youngest team plus the goal. The goal is like, or the bonus rather is that they can't get pregnant. You got that? Yeah. I mean it's over. Yeah. Well I mean that's a, that's not happening, but you can still get some diseases and stuff. Yes they do. Yes they do. But the thing is where are they getting them?

Speaker 1:          05:34          Well, somebody had it and then the next thing you know, all a hundred people in that building have done it right. But did they have it already or do they getting it from the building now? They had it already. He had it already. So you're dealing with herpes or you're dealing with like the real weird ones like syphilis and gonorrhea and shit and syphilis and gonorrhea is like, hey, you got to treat this. Where are you getting this? Oh No, it's, it's, it's prevalent. It's everything. Right. But the question is like, are they getting it from outside sources? Maybe. Maybe. I mean, who knows yet that, that, that uh, unfortunately that just had the baby, you know, that it's been invalid for a 20 something years. That's crazy. Yeah. Somebody, somebody knocked her F and I'm like 2007 2011 chlamydia infections amongst Americans 65 and over increased by 31% and syphilis by 52% yeah, but that, the problem with that is 52% all right.

Speaker 1:          06:27          Okay. Let's say there's a hundred cases and then the next year there's 150 all right. That's 52% no big, tens of hundreds of millions of people. My Dad's probably in there going, come on baby. I'm going to buy some preliminary ideas though. I don't like the number of percent because if there's, there's four people and then the next year there's six, that's 50% increase and I'm saying I don't like numbers like that because you could make, oh my God, it's an epidemic I want, I want, I want numbers like human beings. Yeah. Well I'm sure it's out there on the web, but like I said, my dad's probably thinks chlamydia is a flower. He's given us. He's given this girl. I'm going to get you some chlamydia is and we're going to have a good time. Yeah. There's no condoms in nursing homes. You know we got, we got a worse 3000 reported cases of chlamydia among people.

Speaker 1:          07:21          45 and older. Okay, but I'm 45 and older. That's normal. 45 and older people are walking around meeting New People with 43,000 seems like a very low number. Super Low. That's what I'm saying. That's why I don't like these percentage numbers. Gonorrhea had seat from doing this podcast all these years. I've, I understand when people can make things seem greater than they really are. Go back to that. Jamie, do you have a our P card? No, but someone set one to us, to me and Ari. Ari to the comedy store, but I think that was just some asshole who tried to thousand sounds low. Yeah. Primary and secondary syphilis 5,650 cases were reported in this age group, but that is 45 the thing about 45 and older is 45 year old people in 2019 it's not like 45 year old people in the 60s absolutely. These animals are out there fucking hitting the gym and doing squats and flying to Thailand. They're probably getting it from the sweat on the gym bench.
