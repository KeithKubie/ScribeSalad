maturity mismatches you know in equality
 

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.340
maturity mismatches you know in equality
and maturity mismatches and now the

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:50.350
and maturity mismatches and now the

authorities are putting in place some

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:53.520
authorities are putting in place some
 

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.800
authorities are putting in place some
recognition of liquidity which is a very

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:55.810
recognition of liquidity which is a very
 

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:58.920
recognition of liquidity which is a very
good thing but the details of which we

00:16:58.920 --> 00:16:58.930
good thing but the details of which we
 

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:03.480
good thing but the details of which we
haven't been very much working on so

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:03.490
haven't been very much working on so
 

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.760
haven't been very much working on so
that's one thing we have to be careful

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:05.770
that's one thing we have to be careful
 

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:09.059
that's one thing we have to be careful
and that's a very important thing to

00:17:09.059 --> 00:17:09.069
and that's a very important thing to
 

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:11.360
and that's a very important thing to
make sure that the regulated entities

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:11.370
make sure that the regulated entities
 

00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:14.600
make sure that the regulated entities

insurance companies pension funds not be

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:19.030
insurance companies pension funds not be
 

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:22.380
insurance companies pension funds not be
too much exposed to counterparty risk

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:22.390
too much exposed to counterparty risk
 

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:25.829
too much exposed to counterparty risk
and that's something from institutions

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:25.839
and that's something from institutions
 

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:27.809
and that's something from institutions
which themselves are not regulated so

00:17:27.809 --> 00:17:27.819
which themselves are not regulated so
 

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:29.850
which themselves are not regulated so
that's something that we had forgotten

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:29.860
that's something that we had forgotten
 

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:33.600
that's something that we had forgotten
or ignored before the crisis and that's

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:33.610
or ignored before the crisis and that's
 

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:36.419
or ignored before the crisis and that's
why for example an institution like AIG

00:17:36.419 --> 00:17:36.429
why for example an institution like AIG
 

00:17:36.429 --> 00:17:39.690
why for example an institution like AIG
which was Rihan investment bank had to

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:39.700
which was Rihan investment bank had to
 

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:41.580
which was Rihan investment bank had to
be rescued because otherwise I would

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:41.590
be rescued because otherwise I would
 

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:44.040
be rescued because otherwise I would
have been turmoil in the markets because

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:44.050
have been turmoil in the markets because
 

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:46.590
have been turmoil in the markets because
the counterparties would have been in

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:46.600
the counterparties would have been in
 

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:53.100
the counterparties would have been in
trouble then so it's very important to

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:53.110
trouble then so it's very important to
 

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:55.360
trouble then so it's very important to
think about the regulation

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:55.370
think about the regulation
 

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:57.680
think about the regulation
regulation and this is a scene that I've

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:57.690
regulation and this is a scene that I've
 

00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:59.060
regulation and this is a scene that I've
been developing with many other

00:17:59.060 --> 00:17:59.070
been developing with many other
 

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:01.090
