00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.080
 Let's say I have this green court 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.490
 and there is air in it. 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:07.820
 We assume that the molecules of air have 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.340
 temperature and average 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.350
 kinetic energy, but everyone will 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:12.850
 there is a different speed, everyone will hit each other 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.982
 and will move in different directions. 

00:00:14.982 --> 00:00:17.590
 You may notice something on this drawing. 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.720
 On the left side, I will draw 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.350
 imaginary line, we can say that line 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.690
 there is no real, structural significance, 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.230
 does not split the court really, just use it to 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.690
 denotes the left and right sides. 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.210
 You see the left 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.520
 higher concentration of molecules, 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.620
 higher concentration. 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.890
 How do we measure the concentration - 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.451
 such as the number of molecules 

00:00:41.451 --> 00:00:42.950
 in a given volume. 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.350
 But here we see a cross-section of the court. 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.890
 If we look at a portion of this size, 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.550
 here we have four molecules, 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.450
 it seems that we have four molecules, between three and five molecules 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.420
 in part with this size, 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.090
 but if I take part of that amount on the other side, 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.820
 we have about one or two molecules. 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:58.850
 These numbers are not very accurate, but 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.450
 it is clear that we have a higher concentration here. 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.250
 We have more molecules per unit area. 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.400
 But to think in three dimensions, if we think of a volume, 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.650
 we have a higher concentration on the left 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.850
 and a lower concentration on the right, 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.060
 lower concentration on the right. 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.250
 When we have 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.320
 higher concentration in one part of the container and lower in another, 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.420
 we say we have a concentration gradient. 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.250
 Concentration changes from higher to lower, 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.990
 we call this concentration 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.980
 concentration 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.020
 concentration gradient. 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.120
 What do you think will happen? 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.950
 Let's say this is the situation, 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.290
 which we see, 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.290
 what do you think will happen? 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.890
 All of these particles will hit each other 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.190
 and things will shift to the left 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.150
 to the right, will be displaced 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.650
 from left to right. But we have 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.020
 more particles to the left, which 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.690
 can move to the right and fewer particles to the right, 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.610
 which can be moved to the left. 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.250
 Remember, they all move in different directions 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.850
 at random speeds, but we have more particles on this side, 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.990
 they will bounce around, so 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.720
 at any time when we have 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.650
 higher concentration on the left, 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.510
 we have a greater chance of moving particles 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.620
 from left to right, 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.090
 from left to right, 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.120
 than from right to left. 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.620
 As time progresses, 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.520
 the distribution of molecules in the container will look like this. 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.190
 If we let this system stabilize, 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.990
 if we let it stabilize 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.850
 for a while, it will start to look like this. 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.120
 Let's see if I can 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.320
 to paint it well. I will draw 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.890
 only the molecules, I will not paint 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.750
 their velocity vectors. 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.720
 If we wait a bit - How many molecules did we have? 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.560
 One, two, three, four, five, six, 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.090
 seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.250
 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.931
 Now I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, 

00:02:57.931 --> 00:03:02.090
 nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.590
 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.220
 If we wait long enough, 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.390
 that we will no longer have 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.190
 concentration gradient, concentration in all parts 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.382
 the court will be aligned with time. 

00:03:17.382 --> 00:03:19.050
 If I now draw this imaginary 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.190
 dashed line, 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.390
 I will have the same concentration on both sides, 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.560
 there will no longer be a gradient, 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.950
 there is no gradient. 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.810
 This is not magic, 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.220
 molecules have not said, "Oh, we have less concentration 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.020
 on this side, you have somehow 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.850
 to move from the other. ", you just have to know, 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.810
 that molecules jump randomly around the court 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.720
 and if we have a higher concentration on the left, 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.790
 there is a better chance 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.890
 the molecules on the left side go to the right, 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.720
 than the molecules on the right side go to the left. 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.550
 Even in this situation, molecules will move 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.950
 from left to right and from right to left, 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.420
 but now we have the same number on both sides. 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.650
 Therefore, at any moment 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.350
 there is the same likelihood that molecules will move 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:01.920
 from left to right, as well as from 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.690
 right to the left, so we come to a situation 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.681
 of equilibrium. 

00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:07.850
 Of course, if we take it 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.610
 a unit of time, perhaps this molecule is moving 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:11.920
 from left to right, this moves 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.590
 from left to right, 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.290
 this moves from left to right, 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.350
 but because we have the same concentrations on both sides 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.850
 there is the same likelihood that the same number of molecules will move 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.420
 from right to left. 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.320
 In this example, we have only 20, 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.090
 only 20 particles, 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.310
 which is quite artificial and small. 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.590
 If we talk about concentrations 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.950
 of air molecules, 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.620
 or if we deal with cell membranes, 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.850
 if we think of different types of molecules, 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.190
 which are in aqueous solution, 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.650
 we will have far more than 20 molecules. 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:41.820
 If we think 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.090
 for the probabilities of these huge numbers, 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.360
 the probability that something moves from left to right 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.620
 is the same as moving from right to left. 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.190
 We will have this stability. 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.890
 There is a much greater likelihood here 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.340
 in every moment 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.850
 something to move from right to left, 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.210
 therefore we are observing the movement of 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.620
 particles from a higher to a lower concentration. 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.050
 Another way we can look at the matter is that 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.350
 what we are watching is 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.520
 diffusion in the direction of 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.990
 the concentration gradient. 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.130
 So the process we described is diffusion, 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.750
 it's diffusion. 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.420
 When we study different types of systems, 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.150
 we will see that it is very important 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.190
 for biological and even chemical systems, 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.320
 because it does not require extra energy 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.150
 for the movement of particles from here to there, 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.650
 the movement will be probable, 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.050
 of course. Again, this is not magic, 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.820
 there are simply more molecules in this part 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.390
 and a greater chance of moving from left to right, 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.050
 rather than right-to-left. 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.580
 I want this to be clear. 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.290
 There may be a right-to-left movement, 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.920
 for example, this molecule, 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.750
 instead of moving in that direction, 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.150
 it is quite possible to move 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.790
 from right to left. 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.920
 Not exactly every molecule moves from left to right, 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.120
 but there is a better chance molecules can 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.220
 move from left to right. 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.910
 This molecule moves in that direction, 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.250
 because there are more molecules here. 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.490
 Everybody is bumping and jumping in different and 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.900
 random directions.
