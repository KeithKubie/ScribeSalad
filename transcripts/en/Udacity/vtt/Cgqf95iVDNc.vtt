00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
That one is tricky.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm going to answer it the following way--

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
21 is just halfway between 1800 and 2400.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If you take halfway between $144,000 and $192,000,

00:00:15.000 --> 99:59:59.000
we get the mean of 144 and 192 thousand, and that is $168,000.
