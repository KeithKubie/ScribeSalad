00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.210
My name is Raymond Young. I am the
Division Chief for Psychosomatic

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:21.160
Medicine, or Consultation Liaison
Services, in our Department of Psychiatry

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.850
for Emory Healthcare. Psychosomatic
medicine is the interplay between

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:32.829
medicine and psychiatric illness, so it
involves looking at patients who are

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.359
medically ill and addressing potentially
their psychiatric needs. What I enjoy

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:43.690
most about it is the teaching, the
education. I like being involved with our

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.789
young learners. They offer new
perspectives, allow us to think about our

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:55.690
patients differently. My interest in
behavior goes back to early childhood.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.519
As a young child I was a shy person, so I
wanted to learn why was I shy, so that

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.540
was one of the reasons why I got
interested in that. I grew up in the Bay

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.150
Area in a city called Hayward, California.
I grew up with a father who's an OB/GYN,

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.610
so I grew up being a son of a doctor, and
my mother, she was dealing with a chronic

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.720
illness of lupus, and I saw her be very
proactive and managing her own care

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.830
while taking care of us. So I grew up in
a household where education was

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.270
important. It was already determined that
we were going to college . There wasn't a

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.050
question of "After high school what are
you gonna do?" It was like "After college

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:42.040
what are you gonna do?" I went to college
at UC Berkeley. I went to medical school at what

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.870
was called the Medical College of Ohio
in Toledo, and I finished my residency at

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:52.130
Rush Presbyterian in Chicago, Illinois.
My wife and I adopted baby boy, his name

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.910
is Jacob.
We met at our siblings' wedding, so her

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:04.100
older sister and my younger brother are
married, and so we met at their wedding.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.050
I asked her out and we started dating and
then we got married. I enjoy working with

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.080
the geriatric population. One of the
things that Emory does very well is that

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.240
we have a day hospitalization program
called "Transitions" which is a five-day-a-week

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.040
program that is focused on the
geriatric population who are dealing

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.850
with essentially transitions in life -- 
loss of spouse, loss of independence,

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.489
mood disorders, and they engage in groups,
do individual therapy, do medication management.

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.200
My legacy? That that's a challenging question.
I'd like to develop

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.750
a more proactive approach, where we're
more engaged and actively involved with

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.600
the services so that we can see more of
their patients. I think some of the key

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.780
to doing that is having more
integrative care.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.900
I think Emory's is in the process of doing
that, and we have a lot of settings that

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.180
we're doing that -- that's what the Brain
Health Center is meant to be.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.090
I enjoy seeing my patients. I've been
seeing some of my patients for over ten years,

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.840
and it's nice to see them grow and get
better and improve.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.220
And of course there's always
challenges with new patients and trying

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.019
to figure out how I can best help them.
