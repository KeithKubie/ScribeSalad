00:00:11.702 --> 00:00:13.727
We live in a three-dimensional world

00:00:13.751 --> 00:00:14.718
where everything has length,

00:00:14.742 --> 00:00:15.345
width,

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:16.755
and height.

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.152
But what if our world
were two-dimensional?

00:00:19.176 --> 00:00:20.598
We would be squashed down

00:00:20.622 --> 00:00:23.110
to occupy a single plane of existence,

00:00:23.134 --> 00:00:25.124
geometrically speaking, of course.

00:00:25.148 --> 00:00:27.853
And what would that world
look and feel like?

00:00:27.877 --> 00:00:28.512
This is the premise

00:00:28.536 --> 00:00:32.031
of Edwin Abbott's 1884 novella, Flatland.

00:00:32.055 --> 00:00:34.436
Flatland is a fun, mathematical
thought experiment

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.038
that follows the trials
and tribulations of a square

00:00:37.062 --> 00:00:39.579
exposed to the third dimension.

00:00:39.603 --> 00:00:41.959
But what is a dimension, anyway?

00:00:41.983 --> 00:00:44.841
For our purposes,
a dimension is a direction,

00:00:44.865 --> 00:00:47.103
which we can picture as a line.

00:00:47.127 --> 00:00:49.299
For our direction to be a dimension,

00:00:49.323 --> 00:00:53.333
it has to be at right angles
to all other dimensions.

00:00:53.357 --> 00:00:56.121
So, a one-dimensional
space is just a line.

00:00:56.145 --> 00:00:57.926
A two-dimensional space is defined

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.081
by two perpendicular lines,

00:01:00.105 --> 00:01:01.651
which describe a flat plane

00:01:01.675 --> 00:01:03.287
like a piece of paper.

00:01:03.311 --> 00:01:04.692
And a three-dimensional space

00:01:04.716 --> 00:01:06.738
adds a third perpendicular line,

00:01:06.762 --> 00:01:08.020
which gives us height

00:01:08.044 --> 00:01:10.648
and the world we're familiar with.

00:01:10.672 --> 00:01:12.472
So, what about four dimensions?

00:01:12.496 --> 00:01:13.454
And five?

00:01:13.478 --> 00:01:14.571
And eleven?

00:01:14.595 --> 00:01:17.281
Where do we put these new
perpendicular lines?

00:01:17.305 --> 00:01:19.816
This is where Flatland can help us.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.713
Let's look at our square
protagonist's world.

00:01:22.737 --> 00:01:25.241
Flatland is populated by geometric shapes,

00:01:25.265 --> 00:01:26.909
ranging from isosceles trianges

00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:28.176
to equilateral triangles

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.965
to squares,

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:29.494
pentagons,

00:01:29.518 --> 00:01:30.089
hexagons,

00:01:30.113 --> 00:01:32.244
all the way up to circles.

00:01:32.268 --> 00:01:35.007
These shapes are all scurrying
around a flat world,

00:01:35.031 --> 00:01:36.758
living their flat lives.

00:01:36.782 --> 00:01:39.433
They have a single eye
on the front of their faces,

00:01:39.457 --> 00:01:40.516
and let's see what the world looks like

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.432
from their perspective.

00:01:42.456 --> 00:01:45.324
What they see is essentially
one dimension,

00:01:45.348 --> 00:01:46.435
a line.

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:47.822
But in Abbott's Flatland,

00:01:47.846 --> 00:01:49.772
closer objects are brighter,

00:01:49.796 --> 00:01:51.953
and that's how they see depth.

00:01:51.977 --> 00:01:54.285
So a triangle looks
different from a square,

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:55.575
looks different a circle,

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:56.874
and so on.

00:01:56.898 --> 00:01:59.487
Their brains cannot comprehend
the third dimension.

00:01:59.511 --> 00:02:02.363
In fact, they vehemently
deny its existence

00:02:02.387 --> 00:02:04.534
because it's simply not
part of their world

00:02:04.558 --> 00:02:06.233
or experience.

00:02:06.257 --> 00:02:07.298
But all they need,

00:02:07.322 --> 00:02:08.460
as it turns out,

00:02:08.484 --> 00:02:10.574
is a little boost.

00:02:10.598 --> 00:02:12.492
One day a sphere shows up in Flatland

00:02:12.516 --> 00:02:14.241
to visit our square hero.

00:02:14.265 --> 00:02:15.178
Here's what it looks like

00:02:15.202 --> 00:02:17.325
when the sphere passes through Flatland

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.841
from the square's perspective,

00:02:19.865 --> 00:02:22.465
and this blows his little square mind.

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.351
Then the sphere lifts the square

00:02:24.375 --> 00:02:25.889
into the third dimension,

00:02:25.913 --> 00:02:28.938
the height direction where no
Flatlander has gone before

00:02:28.962 --> 00:02:30.943
and shows him his world.

00:02:30.967 --> 00:02:33.528
From up here, the square
can see everything:

00:02:33.552 --> 00:02:34.608
the shapes of buildings,

00:02:34.632 --> 00:02:36.749
all the precious gems hidden in the Earth,

00:02:36.773 --> 00:02:39.321
and even the insides of his friends,

00:02:39.345 --> 00:02:41.993
which is probably pretty awkward.

00:02:42.017 --> 00:02:43.115
Once the hapless square

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:44.868
comes to terms with the third dimension,

00:02:44.892 --> 00:02:46.256
he begs his host to help him

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.497
visit the fourth and higher dimensions,

00:02:48.521 --> 00:02:50.712
but the sphere bristles
at the mere suggestion

00:02:50.736 --> 00:02:52.330
of dimensions higher than three

00:02:52.354 --> 00:02:55.328
and exiles the square back to Flatland.

00:02:55.352 --> 00:02:57.827
Now, the sphere's indignation
is understandable.

00:02:57.851 --> 00:02:59.566
A fourth dimension is very difficult

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.185
to reconcile with our experience
of the world.

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.448
Short of being lifted
into the fourth dimension

00:03:04.472 --> 00:03:05.558
by visiting hypercube,

00:03:05.582 --> 00:03:07.491
we can't experience it,

00:03:07.515 --> 00:03:09.146
but we can get close.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.521
You'll recall that when the sphere

00:03:10.545 --> 00:03:12.440
first visited the second dimension,

00:03:12.464 --> 00:03:14.239
he looked like a series of circles

00:03:14.263 --> 00:03:15.439
that started as a point

00:03:15.463 --> 00:03:16.857
when he touched Flatland,

00:03:16.881 --> 00:03:19.165
grew bigger until he was halfway through,

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:21.162
and then shrank smaller again.

00:03:21.186 --> 00:03:22.492
We can think of this visit

00:03:22.516 --> 00:03:26.658
as a series of 2D
cross-sections of a 3D object.

00:03:26.682 --> 00:03:28.111
Well, we can do the same thing

00:03:28.135 --> 00:03:32.196
in the third dimension
with a four-dimensional object.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.554
Let's say that a hypersphere

00:03:33.578 --> 00:03:36.390
is the 4D equivalent of a 3D sphere.

00:03:36.414 --> 00:03:39.301
When the 4D object passes
through the third dimension,

00:03:39.325 --> 00:03:41.908
it'll look something like this.

00:03:41.932 --> 00:03:43.008
Let's look at one more way

00:03:43.032 --> 00:03:45.708
of representing a four-dimensional object.

00:03:45.732 --> 00:03:46.592
Let's say we have a point,

00:03:46.616 --> 00:03:48.670
a zero-dimensional shape.

00:03:48.694 --> 00:03:50.212
Now we extend it out one inch

00:03:50.236 --> 00:03:52.798
and we have a one-dimensional
line segment.

00:03:52.822 --> 00:03:54.888
Extend the whole line segment by an inch,

00:03:54.912 --> 00:03:57.046
and we get a 2D square.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.404
Take the whole square
and extend it out one inch,

00:03:59.428 --> 00:04:01.341
and we get a 3D cube.

00:04:01.365 --> 00:04:02.991
You can see where we're going with this.

00:04:03.015 --> 00:04:04.153
Take the whole cube

00:04:04.177 --> 00:04:05.509
and extend it out one inch,

00:04:05.533 --> 00:04:08.841
this time perpendicular
to all three existing directions,

00:04:08.865 --> 00:04:11.234
and we get a 4D hypercube,

00:04:11.258 --> 00:04:13.802
also called a tesseract.

00:04:13.826 --> 00:04:14.765
For all we know,

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:16.341
there could be four-dimensional lifeforms

00:04:16.365 --> 00:04:17.594
somewhere out there,

00:04:17.618 --> 00:04:19.095
occasionally poking their heads

00:04:19.119 --> 00:04:20.934
into our bustling 3D world

00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.121
and wondering what all the fuss is about.

00:04:23.145 --> 00:04:24.287
In fact, there could be whole

00:04:24.311 --> 00:04:26.057
other four-dimensional worlds

00:04:26.081 --> 00:04:27.542
beyond our detection,

00:04:27.566 --> 00:04:28.545
hidden from us forever

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:30.927
by the nature of our perception.

00:04:30.951 --> 00:04:34.203
Doesn't that blow
your little spherical mind?
