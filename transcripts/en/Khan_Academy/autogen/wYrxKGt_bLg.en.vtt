00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.530
 Let's solve a few more systems of equations using 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.600
 but we will not use them 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.070
 elimination in one step. 

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.350
 We will need to convert some equations, 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.530
 to prepare them for elimination. 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:22.940
 Let's say we have the equation 5x - 10y = 15 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:32.159
 And we have another equation 3x - 2y = 3. 

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.350
 We want to solve the system using elimination. 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.440
 We could use substitution, we could present graphically 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.430
 the two equations and find where the intersections are crossing. 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.930
 But we will use elimination. 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.740
 The first thing you might say is, "Hey, Sal, we know that 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.450
 in the elimination method we remove the left side 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.160
 one equation from the other or we collect them and then 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.580
 we collect the two right sides. " 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.610
 I can do this because, basically, this is adding 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.180
 of the same thing to both sides of the equation. 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.010
 But here is not obvious that 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.870
 this will be beneficial. 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.970
 If we collect these two left-hand sides, we would get it 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.750
 8x - 12y. 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.580
 This will not remove any one variable. 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.930
 And on the right side 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.030
 we will stay with one number. 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.400
 And if we get out, it will not 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.420
 remove any one variable. 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.710
 How will elimination help us here? 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.370
 And the answer is that we can multiply the two equations 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.070
 in such a way that one of these is possible 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.640
 members can be canceled with one of the others. 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.210
 And indeed, you can choose which member 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.890
 you want to remove. 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.440
 Let's say we want to remove y members. 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.510
 So I will just write this 5x - 10y here again. 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.860
 5x - 10y = 15. 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.260
 Is there anything I can multiply this green equation, 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.420
 so that this article-2u becomes a member, 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.200
 which will be canceled with -10y? 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.980
 Basically i want to do this -2y 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.970
 plus 10y. No? 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.660
 Because if it is plus 10y, it will be canceled when 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.400
 gather the left sides of these equations. 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.280
 So what can I multiply this equation with? 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.770
 If I multiply it by -5, 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.880
 -5 by -2 here will be plus 10. 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.949
 Let's do that. 

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:15.870
 Let's multiply this equation by -5. 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.820
 Multiply the left side by -5 and 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.280
 multiply the right side by -5. 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.310
 And what do you get? 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.110
 Do not forget that we in principle 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.490
 we do not change the equation. 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.700
 We do not change the information in the equation. 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.750
 We do the same thing on both sides. 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.780
 So the left side of the equation becomes 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.310
 -5 by 3x is -15x. 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.010
 And then -5 on -2y is plus 10y, 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.210
 equal to 3 in -5, which is -15. 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.820
 And now we are ready to make our elimination. 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.980
 Add this to the left side of the yellow equation 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.020
 and add - 15 to the right side of the yellow equation, 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.690
 we add the same thing 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.460
 to both sides of the equation. 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.230
 Because this is equal to that. 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.480
 So let's do that. 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.260
 Let's do it. 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.430
 5x - 15y, we have this negative sign there, 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.020
 we do not want to lose it, it's -10x. 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.320
 the authors are canceled. 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.430
 -10y plus 10y is 0y. 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.700
 This is the whole point of multiplying by -5. 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.230
 Will be equal to ... -15 minus 15 is 0. 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.450
 -10x is equal to 0. 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:43.250
 We divide both sides to -10 and get 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.010
 x is equal to 0. 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.880
 And now we can substitute back into any of these equations, 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.920
 to understand how much it should be. 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.960
 Let's replace the above equation. 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:01.280
 We get 5 at 0, minus 10y is equal to 15. 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.560
 Or -10y is equal to 15. 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.240
 Let me write it down. 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.290
 -10y is equal to 15. 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.660
 We divide the two sides to -10. 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.670
 And we stay with y equals 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.620
 -15/10, which is -3 / 2. 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.100
 If we had to draw it, the point of intersection 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.430
 with Ou would be a point (0; -3/2). 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.370
 And you can check that it also satisfies this equation. 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.650
 The initial equation here was 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.290
 3x - 2u = 3. 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:48.370
 3 at 0, which is 0, minus 2 at -3/2 is ... that's it 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.810
 0, this is plus 3. 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:52.080
 No? 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.160
 These are canceled, this is positive. 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.130
 Plus 3 is equal to 3. 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.040
 So it really satisfies both equations. 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.160
 Let's do one more of these tasks where we need to multiply 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.550
 to convert the equations 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.000
 and then we can eliminate one of the variables. 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.550
 Let's do another task. 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:21.330
 Say we have 5x + 7y = 15. 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.870
 And we have 7 ... let's do it in another color 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:31.350
 7x - 3y = 5. 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.810
 Again, if you just collect or pull out 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.020
 you will not remove the two left sides 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.170
 none of the variables. 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.350
 They do not have the same coefficient 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.180
 or the negative of their coefficient. 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.940
 So let's choose a variable to remove. 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.740
 Let's say we want this time to remove the x. 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.180
 And you can literally get it 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.930
 or one variable or the other. 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:50.480
 It does not matter. 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.415
 You can decide to remove the scientists first. 

00:05:52.415 --> 00:05:55.710
 But I choose to eliminate the xs first. 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.840
 I have to convert one or both of these equations, 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.330
 that these guys have the same odds, 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.510
 or their coefficients have opposing signs, 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.400
 so when I gather the left sides, 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.600
 they will destroy each other. 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.960
 There is nothing obvious here - I can multiply this by 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.630
 some liver to make it equal to -5. 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.930
 Or multiply this with some liver to make it equal to -7. 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.420
 But even more fun thing I can do is try to put in both 

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.220
 their least common fold. 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.980
 I can take on both 35. 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.130
 And the way I can do it is by multiplying them one by one. 

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.775
 So I can multiply the above equation by 7. 

00:06:32.775 --> 00:06:38.170
 Let's multiply the above equation by 7. 

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.560
 And I choose 7, so this will be 35. 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:49.725
 And I can multiply the lower equation by -5. 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.190
 I do this to make the coefficient -35. 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.980
 Do not forget that my goal is to eliminate the x. 

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:00.670
 If this happens 35 and if I do this -35, 

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:01.630
 then I will be ready with everything. 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.480
 I can gather the left and the right 

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.070
 sides of the equations. 

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.996
 In the above equation, when multiplying it by 7 ... 

00:07:09.996 --> 00:07:13.790
 let's roll a little up ... we multiply it by 7, 

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:22.960
 becomes 35x + 49y is equal to ... to see, it is 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:28.950
 70 + 35 is equal to 105. 

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:29.250
 No? 

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.930
 15 and 70, plus 35, is equal to 105. 

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.960
 This is where the above equation is transformed. 

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:41.100
 The lower equation is: -5 by 7x is -35x, 

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:47.110
 -5 by -3y is plus 15y. 

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:48.520
 Negative characters are canceled. 

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.640
 And then 5 ... this is not -5 ... 

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.060
 this is -5. 

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:57.640
 5 by -5 equals -25. 

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:01.760
 Now we can start with this upper equation and add the same thing 

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.220
 something to both sides where this one thing is -25, 

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.130
 which is also equal to this expression. 

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:09.960
 Let's collect her left 

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:10.710
 right sides. 

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:13.250
 Because we really add the same thing 

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.200
 to both sides of the equation. 

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.430
 So on the left side the hikes are canceled. 

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.050
 35x - 35x. 

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.020
 That was the whole point. 

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:27.760
 They are canceled and we receive 49y + 15y. 

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.360
 That's 64y. 

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:37.470
 64y is equal to 105 minus 25, equals 80. 

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:49.060
 We divide both sides at 64 and get y = 80/64. 

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:53.870
 And let's see if we divide the numerator and the denominator into 8 ... 

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:55.570
 you can actually do it with 16. 

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:56.780
 16 will be better. 

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:58.590
 But let's do it first with 8, just because 

00:08:58.590 --> 00:08:59.860
 we know the table with 8. 

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:03.720
 This becomes 10/8 and then you can divide this to 2 

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.200
 and you get 5/4. 

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.020
 If you divide straight to 16, 

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.600
 you will stay straight with 5/4. 

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.340
 So y is equal to 5/4. 

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.390
 Let's find out how x is. 

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:16.340
 We can substitute for each of these equations 

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.300
 or in one of the initial equations. 

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.140
 Let's replace the second of the original equations, 

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:26.250
 where we had 7x - 3y = 5. 

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:29.450
 This was the initial version of the second equation, which 

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.790
 we later turned into that. 

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:42.070
 We get 7x minus 3 y - 5/4 - is equal to 5. 

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:49.180
 Or 7x - 15/4 = 5. 

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:54.600
 Let's add 15/4 ... Oh, I'm sorry I did not do it right. 

00:09:54.600 --> 00:10:00.780
 This will be 7x minus 3 in 4 ... Oh, sorry, that was right. 

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:01.290
 What am I doing? 

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:05.520
 3 by 5/4 is 15/4. 

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.290
 Is equal to 5. 

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:16.960
 Let's add 15/4 to both sides. And so, plus 15/4, plus 15/4. 

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.290
 And what will we get? 

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:20.940
 The left hand is only 7x. 

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.630
 These guys are canceled. 

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:24.810
 And this will be equal to 5, 

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:27.000
 which is the same thing as 20/4. 

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.740
 20/4 plus 15/4. 

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:37.610
 Or get the following ... Let's roll a little down ... 

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:41.820
 7x is equal to 35/4. 

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:45.750
 We can multiply both sides by 1/7 or we can divide both 

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.240
 sides of 7, the same thing is. 

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.530
 Let's multiply both sides by 1/7. 

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:53.380
 The same thing as dividing the 7th. 

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:56.520
 These are canceled and left with x equal to ... 

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:59.190
 Here, if you divide 35 to 7, you get 5. 

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:01.340
 You divide 7 to 7, you get 1. 

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:05.100
 So x is equal to 5/4. 

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:09.960
 So the point of crossing this is - 

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:14.170
 and x, and y will be equal to 5/4. 

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:18.900
 If you look at this as a graph, the point is (5/4; 5/4). 

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.170
 And let's check if this satisfies the above equation. 

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:30.830
 If you take 5 5/4, plus 7 5/4, 

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:31.530
 what do you get? 

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:33.330
 It must be equal to 15. 

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:39.580
 So this is equal to 25/4 plus ... How much is that? 

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:43.560
 This is plus 35/4. 

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:48.020
 That is equal to 60/4, which is really equal to 15. 

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.220
 So this definitely satisfies the above equation. 

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.750
 You can check the lower equation for yourself, 

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:54.630
 but it should be because we actually used the lower equation, 

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.750
 to find that x is equal to 5/4. 

00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:00.066
 .
