00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.040
Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day. So in the last episode I explained

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.050
that it's not always the most athletic team that wins in sport, sometimes it involves

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.090
the physical manipulation of objects, so sometimes it's the most intelligent team.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.120
So today, on Smarter Every Day, let's take a look at the physics of curling.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.140
[music]

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.170
OK before we watch some curlers we need to learn the basics of the sport.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.190
This is the curling sheet and the circles are the house. The goal is to get your team's rock

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.240
closest to the button. There's four people on each team. The thrower,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.280
the sweepers and the skip who's in charge. Each team has eight stones

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.310
to throw, so each person throws two. They alternate with the other team

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.340
so there's a total of 16 stones thrown. The very last one is called the hammer,

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.370
which is a major advantage. Do you have any idea how difficult it was to find a

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.420
curling stone in Alabama? It is really hard. Anyway, so I know what you're thinking. Curling's like

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.450
the caveman sport right? I'm gonna slide this rock on ice and I'm gonna hit another rock

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.500
and we're just gonna try to out-rock each other. But oh no, it's way more difficult than that.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.570
In fact there's so many things I had never even considered until

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.610
I took a closer look at how this works. For example, the simplest question of them all.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.640
What makes a curling stone curl? OK let's pretend for just a second

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.670
that this isn't my coffee table, it's actually a curling sheet.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.750
So we know from watching TV that when a player is back here at the hack, which is where they start, 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.770
and he pushes it toward the house where you're at, which is the bullseye on the ice, as he

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.860
rotates it or spins it counter clockwise it'll curl in the direction

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.900
of that rotation, right? Now my assumption is that has something to do with this,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.920
which is called the running band. You'll see the bottom of the curling stone is concave

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.960
but there's this circular frictional interface that interfaces with the ice.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.060
So we should be able to model a circular frictional interface of a moving

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.090
sliding object on a rigid surface right? Which is this,

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.110
a glass. I'm gonna take this circular object, I'm gonna put it down on the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.130
low friction surface, I'm gonna push it towards you and spin it, and expect

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.140
a curl in the direction of rotation. Let's give it a shot.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.230
But I don't see that. Let's try this again. Set this down,

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.240
push toward you, spin it, curl. Here we go.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.260
No. It curls in the opposite direction. This is actually what's really

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.290
confused scientists for a really long time. That interface of a normal

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.310
moving sliding spinning object on a rigid surface, behaves completely

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.350
different with normal objects than it does with a curling stone.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.390
There's something magical happening right here on this running band between the stone

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.410
and ice. So clearly the next step is to go find us some ice.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:44.540
 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.980
Ohhh!

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.980
I wet my pants. Let's try again.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.840
 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.660
Oh man. So the curling stone

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.700
goes in the direction of rotation but the cup goes opposite, which I can understand because

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.720
as it's decelerating on the table it's trying to tip over, causing more force

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.750
on that leading edge of the cup. So when it's spinning it's pushing against

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.800
the table with its leading edge. That makes sense to me. So let's go to the curling club

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.810
in Milwaukee Wisconson and see if they can teach us something with prepared ice

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.830
and skill, most importantly.
- We are at the Milwaukee Curling Club. We are located

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.860
at the fairgrounds in Ozaukee County. This club is

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.900
the oldest continuous curling club in the United States.
(Destin) Before a game can be played the ice has

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.920
to be properly prepared, which is a science within itself. If a stone

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.940
rests on flat ice it creates a lot of contact friction which makes the stones run

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.980
slowly. Curlers use an intricate technique called pebbling to decrease the friction

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.030
of the stones on the ice. Deionized water that's been purified by reverse

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.050
osmosis is sprinkled onto the ice in a very specific way and allowed to freeze.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.090
Here you can see Jay pebbling the ice by swinging a sprinkler nozzle

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.130
back and forth. You can't imagine the amount of variables that have to be controlled during this process.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.180
Number of arm swings, how fast he walks, humidity,

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.230
the difference in height between the tank and the sprinkler head, the temperature of the water, yeah.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.290
It's pretty crazy. After pebbling they use a blade to nip the top of the pebbles off to

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.310
create a smooth uniform running surface. Because there's more pressure on the tops

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.360
of the pebbles, there's more friction melting which causes less friction.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.400
Which leads us to sweeping. Before I researched curling I thought the sweepers

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.430
were somehow increasing or decreasing the friction on one side of the stone or the other and making it curl.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.470
I was absolutely wrong. The sweepers actually sweep in order to heat

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.490
the ice up and make it curl less. If you threw two stones exactly the same

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.520
and you didn't sweep one but you swept the other, you would find that the swept one

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.540
would go straighter and farther. This is a scanning electron microscope image

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.570
of a pebble on the ice. You can see that it's been nipped on the top so it's fresh.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.600
This however is an image of a pebble after it's been swept. You can plainly

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.620
see that there's grain boundaries from where it melted when it was swept with a broom.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.680
That thin layer of water that forms acts as a lubrication

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.770
barrier, reducing the friction and allowing the stone to travel farther and faster.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.790
So this is where it gets interesting. So we're trying to figure out why the

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.860
curling stone curls right? So I look around and I find the international experts

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.900
for curling physics. I find the guy in Canada, and I find a team in Sweden

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.940
and so I start reading all their papers. Turns out these guys are not even close to

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.020
agreeing. It's really interesting. In fact they've never even communicated

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.050
with their voices. They only communicate via technical paper. Fascinating.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.110
I called the guys up on the phone and I had like an hour and a half conversation with both

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.120
groups, trying to understand what exactly is the mechanism.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:39.170
Harald Nyberg at Uppsala University in Sweden explained something to me

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.200
called the scratch theory. Visualize a stone rotating and moving down the ice.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.230
Now think about the running band and what the scratches that would make

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.270
look like as it goes down the sheet. The edges of the running band would make this really

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.350
awesome overlapping pattern as it slides down. The Swedish scientists

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.430
say that because the rough spots at the rear of the band

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.480
have to hop over the scratches created by the leading edge of the running band, this will

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.490
induce a force on the rear of the stone making it curl in the direction of rotation.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.570
They claim to prove this by showing images of pebbles

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.590
that have been scratched at an angle after the stone slides over them. They also did an experiment by scratching

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.620
ice really deeply with sandpaper at two angles and pushing a stone

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.650
across the scratches without rotating it.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:27.670
 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.690
 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:35.720
 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.760
Pretty convincing right? Not so fast. Dr Mark Shegalski at the University of

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.840
Northern British Columbia in Canada once threw a stone with a polished metal running band

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.860
which doesn't produce the same type of scratches. He observed that it

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.910
curled like a normal stone by throwing it on freshly pebbled ice.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.950
Dr Shegalski believes that the mechanism is something called asymmetric friction melting.

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.990
When the stone travels over the ice the friction heats up the ice and melts it,

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:04.010
creating that lubrication barrier that we discussed earlier. He believes that there's

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:08.050
more frictional wetting on the front side than the back due to the rock tending to tip over

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:12.080
just like the cup did in our earlier experiment. Another possibility is that

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:16.110
because the side of the rock that's advancing moves faster relative to the ice than the

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:20.140
retreating side, it could be creating more lubrication. You can visualize this

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.170
by looking back at the difference in the contact patterns. This additional

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:28.190
relative motion would create more frictional heat up on top, which would melt more ice.

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:32.220
This water could then be transported forward by the rotation and

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.240
lubricate the leading edge of the band more than the rear edge. That forward tipping of the rock

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:40.270
or the water transport theory pushes the rock into the direction of rotation.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:44.300
Both scientists are convinced that their theory is the dominant mechanism

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.320
taking place at the back of the running band. But they agree however that more work still

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:52.340
needs to be done. Personally I don't think either one of the theories can stand up to all of the questions

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.390
on its own. I think the ultimate model might be a combination of both of the theories.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:08:00.410
Dr Shegelski believes there may even be 1 or 2 other mechanisms at play here that would help

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:04.440
describe the mysterious motion of the curling stone. Who knows,

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:08.490
what I do know however is that the nations that have scientists researching the physics

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:12.540
of curling are the same nations that most often have olympic athletes

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.550
on the podiums for curling. Hey I have a huge announcement here

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:20.610
on my way home from work. I'm not sure if you can tell but these videos take a lot of time

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:24.630
and effort. Yeah you can, you're smart. You know what I'm doing here. You know how there are two different

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:28.680
experts for curling right? And I consulted them both to get the best idea.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.720
Well I've done the same thing for something else. Jack Conte from Patreon

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.730
and Hank Green, co-founder of Subbable, have created two different platforms that

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:40.760
content creators like me can use to try to generate support for what they do.

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:44.770
Now the idea is if you enjoy and place some kind of value on

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:48.790
Smarter Every Day, that you can voluntarily... You can, I'm not saying

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:52.820
do, but you can voluntarily decide to assist

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.870
what I do. Anyway, you can go to either one of these pages, Patreon or Subbable, and there's all

00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:00.880
kinds of different perks on there. There's ways to reach out to me, there's

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:04.920
posters, there's all kinds of stuff. Infographics. So Patreon is a

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.950
per video model, and Subbable is a per month model. Now I didn't know what

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:12.980
would work best so I contacted both these guys and decided to test it for myself

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
to see which one works the best for Smarter Every Day. Anyway, you can test them

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:21.030
and see what works best for you. Anyway, I'll leave links to the Patreon and Subbable

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:25.050
Smarter Every Day pages and if you would be willing to support Smarter Every Day, that would be awesome.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:29.070
It would make my life better because I can streamline my workflow

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:33.100
and probably be a better dad because I might have a little more time. Anyway, I'm Destin.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.150
Thank you for even considering that. Subbable and Patreon, Smarter Every Day.

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:41.190
I'll leave links here and in the video description. Thanks, bye.

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:45.210
 

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:49.270
[laughing]

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:53.300
 

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.320
You're trying this at your house right? [Glass breaking] Oh

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:01.360
[whispered] crap.
I just broke it.

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:05.400
Don't tell on me. In physics there's a principle called the conservation

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:09.450
of momentum, so if momentum is mass times velocity and the curling stones

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:13.460
all have the same mass, you could assume that it's velocity that's conserved.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:17.490
For the most part, the forward velocity of the stone just before impact is gonna be

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:21.510
equivalent to the forward velocity in the system just after impact.

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:25.540
This works for both the X direction and the Y direction. Since there's no sideways

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:29.560
velocity before impact, the lateral velocity after the impacts has to equal out

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.590
to zero. Isn't that cool?

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:35.590
