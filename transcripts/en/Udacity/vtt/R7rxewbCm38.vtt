00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.220
What I want to do next, is to look at how

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.780
version control systems actually work. We saw what they are. We

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.130
saw why they are useful. But how do they actually work?

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.460
And we're going to do that by starting from some essential

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.400
actions that version control systems perform. The first one is the

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.920
addition of files. So, when you use a version control system,

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.280
you can add a file to the repository. And at that

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.400
point the file will be accessible to other people who have access

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.640
to the repository. And now the fundamental action is commit.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.230
When you change a file, a file that is already in

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.610
the repository, when you make some local changes to a

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.430
file that is already in the repository, you want then to

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.460
commit your changes to the central repository, so they can

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.990
become visible to all of the other users on the repository. Finally,

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.770
another fundamental action is the action of updating a file. If

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.650
we have a repository and someone else can modify the files

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.800
in the repository, I want to be able to get

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.550
the changes that other people made to the files in the

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.980
repository. And these are just three of the basic actions, but

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.870
there are many, many more. And we'll see several of those.
