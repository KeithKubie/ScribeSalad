00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709
more best practice information for India
 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.569
more best practice information for India
and Brazil so we met with Daniel at in

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579
and Brazil so we met with Daniel at in
 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.250
and Brazil so we met with Daniel at in
the Brazil team and he actually

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260
the Brazil team and he actually
 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.140
the Brazil team and he actually
mentioned that our pricing strategy in

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150
mentioned that our pricing strategy in
 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.970
mentioned that our pricing strategy in
in the Brazil market is it's pretty

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980
in the Brazil market is it's pretty
 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.490
in the Brazil market is it's pretty
appropriate then we taught to Kahn on in

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500
appropriate then we taught to Kahn on in
 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.520
appropriate then we taught to Kahn on in
the India in Google India team and she

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530
the India in Google India team and she
 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:43.720
the India in Google India team and she
mentioned that we're we're still a

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730
mentioned that we're we're still a
 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.449
mentioned that we're we're still a
little bit too we're too expensive for

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459
little bit too we're too expensive for
 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.379
little bit too we're too expensive for
that region so what we did is instead of

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389
that region so what we did is instead of
 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:54.069
that region so what we did is instead of
putting a $97 pricing USD pricing

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079
putting a $97 pricing USD pricing
 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.020
putting a $97 pricing USD pricing
equivalent in India we did something a

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030
equivalent in India we did something a
 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.030
equivalent in India we did something a
little bit lower we did a 10 rupee offer

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040
little bit lower we did a 10 rupee offer
 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.879
little bit lower we did a 10 rupee offer
which equates to around like 15 cents

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:00.889
which equates to around like 15 cents
 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:04.059
which equates to around like 15 cents
USD and while it was price really low we

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069
USD and while it was price really low we
 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.640
USD and while it was price really low we
did make it up in volume 2 so there's no

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650
did make it up in volume 2 so there's no
 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.620
did make it up in volume 2 so there's no
one-size-fits-all for emerging markets

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630
one-size-fits-all for emerging markets
 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:09.910
one-size-fits-all for emerging markets
but we got it we just got a test

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920
but we got it we just got a test
 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.250
but we got it we just got a test
different price points yeah for sure and

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260
different price points yeah for sure and
 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.710
different price points yeah for sure and
Jim with you guys as well when with some

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720
Jim with you guys as well when with some
 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.879
Jim with you guys as well when with some
of the markets you're approaching how do

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889
of the markets you're approaching how do
 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.770
of the markets you're approaching how do
you think about that yeah also let's

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780
you think about that yeah also let's
 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:18.940
you think about that yeah also let's
kind of take a look at it from a

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950
kind of take a look at it from a
 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.500
kind of take a look at it from a
different perspective which is just

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510
different perspective which is just
 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.570
different perspective which is just
taking a look at what the cultural and

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580
taking a look at what the cultural and
 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.520
taking a look at what the cultural and
worldwide events are that are going on

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.270
important and so we want to make sure
that we want to encourage the gameplay

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280
that we want to encourage the gameplay
 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.920
that we want to encourage the gameplay
during that time period so we'll put

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930
during that time period so we'll put
 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.420
during that time period so we'll put
special sales on during that

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430
special sales on during that
 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.520
special sales on during that
time period but won't run any special

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530
time period but won't run any special
 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.470
time period but won't run any special
you way campaigns because we know we

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480
you way campaigns because we know we
 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.090
you way campaigns because we know we
want that get that kind of return during

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100
want that get that kind of return during
 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.720
want that get that kind of return during
that time period and then other things

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730
that time period and then other things
 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.610
that time period and then other things
like that tax you know at the beginning

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620
like that tax you know at the beginning
 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.550
like that tax you know at the beginning
of the year we started charging fat on

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560
of the year we started charging fat on
 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.580
of the year we started charging fat on
top of all of the packages that we had

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590
top of all of the packages that we had
 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.800
top of all of the packages that we had
and we had to be really aware of what

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810
and we had to be really aware of what
 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.150
and we had to be really aware of what
the impact of that was going to be on

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160
the impact of that was going to be on
 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.880
the impact of that was going to be on
the players especially on the lower end

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:03.890
the players especially on the lower end
 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.060
the players especially on the lower end
the entry points because on the google

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070
the entry points because on the google
 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.010
the entry points because on the google
site at least there's no pricing tiers

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020
site at least there's no pricing tiers
 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.600
site at least there's no pricing tiers
so we can actually set up whatever we

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610
so we can actually set up whatever we
 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.370
so we can actually set up whatever we
need to and on the other side there are

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380
need to and on the other side there are
 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.660
need to and on the other side there are
so we have to figure out what kinds of

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670
so we have to figure out what kinds of
 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.010
so we have to figure out what kinds of
items we want to put in there that will

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020
items we want to put in there that will
 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.200
items we want to put in there that will
entice them more or how we even pop up

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210
entice them more or how we even pop up
 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.880
entice them more or how we even pop up
those messages to get some of those

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890
those messages to get some of those
 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.640
those messages to get some of those
early players on board and then I said

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650
early players on board and then I said
 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.680
early players on board and then I said

alternative packages like rewarded

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740
alternative packages like rewarded
 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.220
alternative packages like rewarded

much during the time where the the lira
 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.950
much during the time where the the lira
is a lot lower and really make sure that

you're having to think about like
 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.190
you're having to think about like
geopolitical happening around the world

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:09.200
geopolitical happening around the world
 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.220

rewarded video did you change the

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930
rewarded video did you change the
 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.420
rewarded video did you change the
pricing like how did how did you

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.430
pricing like how did how did you
 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.220
pricing like how did how did you
actually react to that no so what we

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:21.230
actually react to that no so what we
 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.140
actually react to that no so what we
figured was it was really important to

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150
figured was it was really important to
 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.820
figured was it was really important to
watch what was going on in the market

wait and see what would happen and
 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.900
wait and see what would happen and
things actually turned out fine in terms

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:34.910
things actually turned out fine in terms
 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.030
things actually turned out fine in terms
of what players were interested in and

it's the one piece that I think is
 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.480
it's the one piece that I think is
really important don't react quickly and

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:43.490
really important don't react quickly and

community so we figured let's tap into

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:44.110
community so we figured let's tap into
 

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.050
community so we figured let's tap into
something that actually resonates with

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:46.060
something that actually resonates with

portion that actually play the game as
well so our first important thing to do

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:56.380
well so our first important thing to do
 

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.590
well so our first important thing to do
is make sure that we had a synchronous

00:08:58.590 --> 00:08:58.600
is make sure that we had a synchronous
 

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.780
is make sure that we had a synchronous
game play and just set it up that way

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:00.790
game play and just set it up that way

game play and just set it up that way
how do you make it so that people can

00:09:02.189 --> 00:09:02.199
how do you make it so that people can
 

00:09:02.199 --> 00:09:03.079
how do you make it so that people can
get on to

00:09:03.079 --> 00:09:03.089
get on to
 

00:09:03.089 --> 00:09:05.210
get on to
players three players four players on

players three players four players on
 

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.850
players three players four players on
top of that we then added community and

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:07.860
top of that we then added community and
 

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.949
top of that we then added community and
customer service and with the customer

00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:09.959
customer service and with the customer
 

00:09:09.959 --> 00:09:11.509
customer service and with the customer
service is important to have people who

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519
service is important to have people who
 

00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:14.269
service is important to have people who
were from Turkey not only had to speak

00:09:14.269 --> 00:09:14.279
were from Turkey not only had to speak
 

00:09:14.279 --> 00:09:15.499

the language I could say and don't worry

00:09:15.499 --> 00:09:15.509
the language I could say and don't worry
 

00:09:15.509 --> 00:09:17.360
the language I could say and don't worry
about necessarily Justin's translation

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:17.370
about necessarily Justin's translation
 

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:20.449
about necessarily Justin's translation
but really understood the mentality of

00:09:20.449 --> 00:09:20.459
but really understood the mentality of
 

00:09:20.459 --> 00:09:22.040
but really understood the mentality of
people who play the game and what

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:22.050
people who play the game and what
 

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:24.379
people who play the game and what
they're looking for and then we finally

00:09:24.379 --> 00:09:24.389
they're looking for and then we finally
 

00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:25.939
they're looking for and then we finally
added a component on top of that where

00:09:25.939 --> 00:09:25.949
added a component on top of that where
 

00:09:25.949 --> 00:09:27.679
added a component on top of that where
they could wager for chips and really

00:09:27.679 --> 00:09:27.689
they could wager for chips and really
 

00:09:27.689 --> 00:09:30.730
they could wager for chips and really
get that additional excitement around it

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:30.740
get that additional excitement around it
 

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:33.019
get that additional excitement around it
and what was important I think for

00:09:33.019 --> 00:09:33.029

throughout this whole thing was the
timing the the patient of the game what

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920
timing the the patient of the game what
 

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.100

approaching those markets and it's
 

00:10:44.249 --> 00:10:46.759
approaching those markets and it's
ideally somewhat lightweight in terms of

interesting is is I don't know if you
can say this is like a financial

00:11:59.010 --> 00:11:59.020
can say this is like a financial
 

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:00.269
can say this is like a financial
relationship or is it just purely

00:12:00.269 --> 00:12:00.279
relationship or is it just purely

universities were giving them there's a

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:04.690
universities were giving them there's a
 

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:06.570
universities were giving them there's a
price where ever wins you know so just

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:06.580
price where ever wins you know so just
 

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.550
price where ever wins you know so just
helps where the tuition so okay that's

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:08.560
helps where the tuition so okay that's
 

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.980
helps where the tuition so okay that's
great yeah yeah so I mean I think that

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:10.990
great yeah yeah so I mean I think that

there's a lot of these different things
 

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.680
there's a lot of these different things
to think about when you're obviously

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:13.690

I'd like to potentially now transition
 

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.019
I'd like to potentially now transition
to some of these technical issues that a

00:12:22.019 --> 00:12:22.029
to some of these technical issues that a
 

00:12:22.029 --> 00:12:24.510
to some of these technical issues that a
lot of our partners face and actually

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:24.520
lot of our partners face and actually

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:29.680
panel that even size can be a big issue
 

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.850
panel that even size can be a big issue
so Jim walk us through some of the the

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:32.860
so Jim walk us through some of the the
 

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.470
so Jim walk us through some of the the
technical things that you had to think

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:34.480
technical things that you had to think
 

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.889
technical things that you had to think
about before you approach the market or

00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:36.899
about before you approach the market or
 

00:12:36.899 --> 00:12:39.180

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:55.270
we had a couple of different things
 

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:58.319
we had a couple of different things
going on with a few of our games so in

00:12:58.319 --> 00:12:58.329
going on with a few of our games so in
 

00:12:58.329 --> 00:12:59.940
going on with a few of our games so in
the case of okay that I was talking

00:12:59.940 --> 00:12:59.950
the case of okay that I was talking
 

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:03.150
the case of okay that I was talking
about it's predominantly played in

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:03.160
about it's predominantly played in
 

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.630
about it's predominantly played in
Turkey and the closest AWS server that

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:06.640
Turkey and the closest AWS server that
 

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.090
Turkey and the closest AWS server that
we could get was in Germany so there

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:09.100
we could get was in Germany so there
 

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.430
we could get was in Germany so there
were some latency issues not horrible

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:11.440
were some latency issues not horrible
 

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.590
were some latency issues not horrible
but we were able to find servers that

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:13.600
but we were able to find servers that
 

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.199
but we were able to find servers that
were local within Turkey that were price

00:13:16.199 --> 00:13:16.209
were local within Turkey that were price
 

00:13:16.209 --> 00:13:18.180
were local within Turkey that were price
competitive as well that actually were

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:18.190
competitive as well that actually were
 

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:19.949
competitive as well that actually were
much better in terms of the latency

00:13:19.949 --> 00:13:19.959
much better in terms of the latency
 

00:13:19.959 --> 00:13:21.569
much better in terms of the latency
issue so we were able to hook them up

00:13:21.569 --> 00:13:21.579
issue so we were able to hook them up
 

00:13:21.579 --> 00:13:25.280
issue so we were able to hook them up
over there we've also had

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:25.290
over there we've also had
 

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:27.259
over there we've also had
situations like with poker will we

00:13:27.259 --> 00:13:27.269
situations like with poker will we
 

00:13:27.269 --> 00:13:29.150
situations like with poker will we
thought okay this is a global game how

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:29.160
thought okay this is a global game how
 

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.850
thought okay this is a global game how
do we target the particularly merchant

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:31.860
do we target the particularly merchant
 

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:35.540
do we target the particularly merchant
markets let's segment the servers based

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:35.550
markets let's segment the servers based
 

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:37.280
markets let's segment the servers based
off of the different languages of the

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:37.290
off of the different languages of the
 

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:38.840
off of the different languages of the
different countries with the people

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:38.850
different countries with the people
 

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:40.699
different countries with the people
they're playing and we found that

00:13:40.699 --> 00:13:40.709
they're playing and we found that
 

00:13:40.709 --> 00:13:42.769
they're playing and we found that
actually had an issue on liquidity that

00:13:42.769 --> 00:13:42.779
actually had an issue on liquidity that
 

00:13:42.779 --> 00:13:44.990
actually had an issue on liquidity that
people weren't able to find other

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:45.000
people weren't able to find other
 

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.819
people weren't able to find other
players because there were on different

00:13:46.819 --> 00:13:46.829
players because there were on different
 

00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:49.280
players because there were on different
servers so to accommodate for that we

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:49.290
servers so to accommodate for that we
 

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:51.740
servers so to accommodate for that we
put everybody back into a single set of

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:51.750
put everybody back into a single set of
 

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:55.670
put everybody back into a single set of
servers again and in order to customize

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:55.680
servers again and in order to customize
 

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.629
servers again and in order to customize
the game for them we try to give them

00:13:58.629 --> 00:13:58.639
the game for them we try to give them
 

00:13:58.639 --> 00:14:01.220
the game for them we try to give them
customized events that we were

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:01.230
customized events that we were
 

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:02.720
customized events that we were
customized from that particular culture

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:02.730
customized from that particular culture
 

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:04.220
customized from that particular culture
but then make something else that was a

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:04.230
but then make something else that was a
 

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:06.319
but then make something else that was a
little bit more generic for the rest of

00:14:06.319 --> 00:14:06.329
little bit more generic for the rest of
 

00:14:06.329 --> 00:14:09.790
little bit more generic for the rest of
the world and then in the case of

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:09.800
the world and then in the case of
 

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.590

rangoli rekha which is a match-three

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:12.600
rangoli rekha which is a match-three
 

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:16.220
rangoli rekha which is a match-three
game that we did in india it was very

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:16.230
game that we did in india it was very
 

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.530
game that we did in india it was very
important that we knew the customer base

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:18.540
important that we knew the customer base
 

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.230
important that we knew the customer base
so it's predominantly Android so we

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:21.240
so it's predominantly Android so we
 

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.420
so it's predominantly Android so we
focused on Android

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:23.430
focused on Android
 

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:27.079
focused on Android
they don't have the same access to Wi-Fi

00:14:27.079 --> 00:14:27.089
they don't have the same access to Wi-Fi
 

00:14:27.089 --> 00:14:29.299
they don't have the same access to Wi-Fi
so we had to make sure that the file

00:14:29.299 --> 00:14:29.309
so we had to make sure that the file
 

00:14:29.309 --> 00:14:31.689
so we had to make sure that the file
size was down so we kept in to 20 Meg's

00:14:31.689 --> 00:14:31.699
size was down so we kept in to 20 Meg's
 

00:14:31.699 --> 00:14:34.939
size was down so we kept in to 20 Meg's
and based on the research that we had

00:14:34.939 --> 00:14:34.949
and based on the research that we had
 

00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:37.100
and based on the research that we had
done we found that it's up to 40% of the

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:37.110
done we found that it's up to 40% of the
 

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:40.460
done we found that it's up to 40% of the
people find other file share servers to

people find other file share servers to
 

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:42.590
people find other file share servers to
go to to download the game so we made

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:42.600
go to to download the game so we made
 

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.600
go to to download the game so we made
sure it was accessible through you know

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:44.610
sure it was accessible through you know
 

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:47.720

Marvel contest of Champions launched we

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:02.550
Marvel contest of Champions launched we
 

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:04.879
Marvel contest of Champions launched we
like players actually had to be on Wi-Fi

00:15:04.879 --> 00:15:04.889
like players actually had to be on Wi-Fi
 

00:15:04.889 --> 00:15:06.350
like players actually had to be on Wi-Fi
in order to download the game the game

I would say like on device around like

00:15:09.439 --> 00:15:09.449
I would say like on device around like
 

00:15:09.449 --> 00:15:12.559
I would say like on device around like
700 megabytes so you could see that

00:15:12.559 --> 00:15:12.569
700 megabytes so you could see that
 

00:15:12.569 --> 00:15:14.420
700 megabytes so you could see that
could be a hurdle for acquisition so we

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:14.430
could be a hurdle for acquisition so we
 

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:15.949
could be a hurdle for acquisition so we
like shortly after that we had to

00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:15.959
like shortly after that we had to
 

00:15:15.959 --> 00:15:18.650
like shortly after that we had to
quickly pivot our central tech strategy

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:18.660
quickly pivot our central tech strategy
 

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.809
quickly pivot our central tech strategy
so what we did is that we made our

00:15:20.809 --> 00:15:20.819
so what we did is that we made our
 

00:15:20.819 --> 00:15:23.269
so what we did is that we made our
initial download 700 megabytes and what

00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279
initial download 700 megabytes and what
 

00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:25.340
initial download 700 megabytes and what
that did for us has enabled players to

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:25.350
that did for us has enabled players to
 

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:28.280
that did for us has enabled players to
download the game over cellular and

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:28.290
download the game over cellular and
 

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:29.210
download the game over cellular and
while they're playing through the

package so not only did we see like

00:15:35.329 --> 00:15:35.339
package so not only did we see like
 

00:15:35.339 --> 00:15:37.400
package so not only did we see like
optimization and our yields and our CPI

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:37.410
optimization and our yields and our CPI
 

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:38.210
optimization and our yields and our CPI
is but also

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:38.220
is but also
 

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:39.470
is but also
made our game more accessible in the

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480
made our game more accessible in the
 

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.030
made our game more accessible in the
emerging markets where the

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040
emerging markets where the
 

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.980
emerging markets where the
infrastructure wasn't really fully

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:42.990
infrastructure wasn't really fully
 

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:44.840
infrastructure wasn't really fully
developed and Wi-Fi wasn't really

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:44.850
developed and Wi-Fi wasn't really
 

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:47.300
developed and Wi-Fi wasn't really
available yeah and I mean I think that

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:47.310
available yeah and I mean I think that
 

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:48.680
available yeah and I mean I think that
highlights a lot of what we were talking

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:48.690
highlights a lot of what we were talking
 

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:50.690
highlights a lot of what we were talking
about earlier today when you saw dom up

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:50.700
about earlier today when you saw dom up

about earlier today when you saw dom up
here on stage why we're so focused on

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:53.820
here on stage why we're so focused on
 

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.630
here on stage why we're so focused on
size reduction you can see the benefits

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:56.640
size reduction you can see the benefits
 

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.280
size reduction you can see the benefits
around actually taking this type of

00:15:58.280 --> 00:15:58.290
around actually taking this type of
 

00:15:58.290 --> 00:15:59.840
around actually taking this type of
model you know more modular approach

00:15:59.840 --> 00:15:59.850
model you know more modular approach
 

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:02.540
model you know more modular approach
more dynamically loading content and

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:02.550
more dynamically loading content and
 

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:04.520
more dynamically loading content and
that's really why we we built the bundle

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:04.530
that's really why we we built the bundle
 

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:06.740
that's really why we we built the bundle
that's why we built that technology and

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:06.750
that's why we built that technology and
 

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:08.690
that's why we built that technology and
I can't reiterate that enough I think

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:08.700
I can't reiterate that enough I think
 

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.460
I can't reiterate that enough I think
we've seen a lot of partners report to

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:10.470
we've seen a lot of partners report to
 

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.440
we've seen a lot of partners report to
us how how important that's been for

simple as size reduction can really

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:15.900
simple as size reduction can really
 

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.590
simple as size reduction can really
Drive that now we're there were there

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:18.600
Drive that now we're there were there
 

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.660
Drive that now we're there were there
any technical challenges that you had to

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:20.670
any technical challenges that you had to
 

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:22.370
any technical challenges that you had to
overcome through that size reduction or

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:22.380
overcome through that size reduction or
 

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:23.990
overcome through that size reduction or
through that kind of like dynamically

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.000

you could share some details on in terms

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920
you could share some details on in terms
 

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.410
you could share some details on in terms
of actual tech yeah so I'm not an

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:30.420
of actual tech yeah so I'm not an
 

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:31.850

all the details but it was definitely

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:33.510
all the details but it was definitely
 

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:36.980
all the details but it was definitely
not an easy process that was it I think

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:36.990
not an easy process that was it I think
 

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:39.080
not an easy process that was it I think
the time that we said we need to do this

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:39.090
the time that we said we need to do this
 

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:40.790
the time that we said we need to do this
versus like when we actually executed

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800
versus like when we actually executed
 

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.950
versus like when we actually executed
was a good like six months so I would

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:42.960
was a good like six months so I would
 

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.060
was a good like six months so I would
say if you guys are starting it if

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:44.070
say if you guys are starting it if
 

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:45.800
say if you guys are starting it if
you're starting off from a full package

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:45.810
you're starting off from a full package

yeah and that's so that's a good thing

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:53.730
yeah and that's so that's a good thing
 

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:55.610
yeah and that's so that's a good thing
to call out to I think when we have

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:55.620
to call out to I think when we have
 

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.890
to call out to I think when we have
these conversations with our partners a

00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:57.900
these conversations with our partners a
 

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:00.440
these conversations with our partners a
lot of times it's not just a quick

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:00.450
lot of times it's not just a quick
 

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:01.970
lot of times it's not just a quick
change that you can put into place this

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:01.980
change that you can put into place this
 

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:03.680
change that you can put into place this
is really an architecture decision at

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:03.690
is really an architecture decision at
 

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:06.080
is really an architecture decision at
the end of the day and that can you kind

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:06.090
the end of the day and that can you kind
 

00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:07.340
the end of the day and that can you kind
of have to leverage a lot of resources

00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:07.350
of have to leverage a lot of resources
 

00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:09.680
of have to leverage a lot of resources
to make that happen so that that kind of

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:09.690
to make that happen so that that kind of
 

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:11.450

definitely lines up with a lot of things

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:11.460
definitely lines up with a lot of things
 

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:13.330
definitely lines up with a lot of things
that we're talking to partners about but

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:13.340
that we're talking to partners about but
 

00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:16.580
that we're talking to partners about but
I'd like to maybe just take a take stock

00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:16.590
I'd like to maybe just take a take stock
 

00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:19.700
I'd like to maybe just take a take stock
of a lot of these ideas and if you could

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:19.710
of a lot of these ideas and if you could
 

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:22.430
of a lot of these ideas and if you could
maybe talk about one or two things that

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:22.440
maybe talk about one or two things that
 

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.170
maybe talk about one or two things that
you'd want the audience to take away

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:24.180
you'd want the audience to take away
 

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.000
you'd want the audience to take away
from something that you know we can

from something that you know we can
 

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:27.590
from something that you know we can
hopefully take away as an actionable

00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600
hopefully take away as an actionable
 

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.140

it will cost a little bit more it'll
 

00:18:49.059 --> 00:18:51.690
it will cost a little bit more it'll
take more time to put together but they

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:51.700
take more time to put together but they
 

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:54.360
take more time to put together but they
value that and they really enjoy seeing

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:54.370
value that and they really enjoy seeing
 

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:55.799
value that and they really enjoy seeing
that they're an important piece to

00:18:55.799 --> 00:18:55.809
that they're an important piece to

those emerging markets if you're

those emerging markets if you're
worldwide because like I was talking

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:01.750
worldwide because like I was talking
 

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:03.810
worldwide because like I was talking
about the liquidity there may be these

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:03.820
about the liquidity there may be these
 

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:05.759
about the liquidity there may be these
smaller countries where you don't have a

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:09.190
it's it's not profitable enough for you
 

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:11.220
it's it's not profitable enough for you
to build something just for that but you

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:11.230
to build something just for that but you
 

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:13.259
to build something just for that but you
can tap into it by leveraging all the

00:19:13.259 --> 00:19:13.269
can tap into it by leveraging all the
 

00:19:13.269 --> 00:19:15.149
can tap into it by leveraging all the
rest of the other people so don't just

00:19:15.149 --> 00:19:15.159
rest of the other people so don't just
 

00:19:15.159 --> 00:19:18.779
rest of the other people so don't just
ignore emerging markets because you

00:19:18.779 --> 00:19:18.789
ignore emerging markets because you
 

00:19:18.789 --> 00:19:21.180
ignore emerging markets because you
don't think you can get into it leverage

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:21.190
don't think you can get into it leverage
 

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:22.590
don't think you can get into it leverage
everything else that you're doing in

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:22.600
everything else that you're doing in
 

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.590
everything else that you're doing in
terms of rest of world yeah mark I think

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:25.600
terms of rest of world yeah mark I think
 

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.330
terms of rest of world yeah mark I think
if you could give us maybe a few things

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:27.340
if you could give us maybe a few things
 

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:29.009
if you could give us maybe a few things
to think about as well yeah I mean like

00:19:29.009 --> 00:19:29.019
to think about as well yeah I mean like
 

00:19:29.019 --> 00:19:30.629
to think about as well yeah I mean like
from a pricing perspective I would just

00:19:30.629 --> 00:19:30.639
from a pricing perspective I would just
 

00:19:30.639 --> 00:19:31.740
from a pricing perspective I would just
say av-test

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:31.750
say av-test
 

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:33.869
say av-test
everything I mean sometimes like the the

00:19:33.869 --> 00:19:33.879
everything I mean sometimes like the the
 

00:19:33.879 --> 00:19:35.519
everything I mean sometimes like the the
biggest wins and learnings come out of

00:19:35.519 --> 00:19:35.529
biggest wins and learnings come out of
 

00:19:35.529 --> 00:19:38.039
biggest wins and learnings come out of
trial and error but I guess like my my

00:19:38.039 --> 00:19:38.049
trial and error but I guess like my my
 

00:19:38.049 --> 00:19:41.310
trial and error but I guess like my my
more general takeaway and advice I could

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:41.320
more general takeaway and advice I could
 

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.320
more general takeaway and advice I could
give is to don't be afraid to ask for

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:43.330
give is to don't be afraid to ask for
