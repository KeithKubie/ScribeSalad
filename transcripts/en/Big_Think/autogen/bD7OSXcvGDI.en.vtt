in some regards and we were not

in some regards and we were not
 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.830
in some regards and we were not
convinced that mark felt had actually

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840
convinced that mark felt had actually
 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.170
convinced that mark felt had actually
given his permission that we knew at the

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180
given his permission that we knew at the
 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.900
given his permission that we knew at the
time that he had serious dementia and

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910
time that he had serious dementia and
 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.930
time that he had serious dementia and
that we thought that this had perhaps

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940
that we thought that this had perhaps
 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.420
that we thought that this had perhaps
been coaxed and had more to do with his

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430
been coaxed and had more to do with his
 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.060
been coaxed and had more to do with his
family and his and a lawyer who

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070
family and his and a lawyer who
 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.450
family and his and a lawyer who
purported to represent him than it did

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460
purported to represent him than it did
 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.730
purported to represent him than it did
with his own wishes and I don't think

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740
with his own wishes and I don't think
 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.860
with his own wishes and I don't think
that if he was not in his advanced state

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870
that if he was not in his advanced state
 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.130
that if he was not in his advanced state
of dementia I doubt seriously that he

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140
of dementia I doubt seriously that he
 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.680
of dementia I doubt seriously that he
would have since he was so adamant

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690
would have since he was so adamant
 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.720
would have since he was so adamant
during all the time up until then that

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730
during all the time up until then that
 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.750
during all the time up until then that
he not reveal and we not reveal this

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760
he not reveal and we not reveal this
 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.280
he not reveal and we not reveal this
identity at the same time and meeting

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290
identity at the same time and meeting
 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.760
identity at the same time and meeting
with him afterwards and I think that we

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770
with him afterwards and I think that we
 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.860
with him afterwards and I think that we
were able to sense some real connection

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870
were able to sense some real connection
 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.350
were able to sense some real connection
despite the dementia I think he was

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360
despite the dementia I think he was
 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.320
despite the dementia I think he was
genuinely relieved in some way or happy

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330
genuinely relieved in some way or happy
 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.100
genuinely relieved in some way or happy
at the attention and that he was he must

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110
at the attention and that he was he must
 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.870
at the attention and that he was he must
have had some sense that he was being

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880
have had some sense that he was being
 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:20.800
have had some sense that he was being
regarded somewhat heroically and I think

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810
regarded somewhat heroically and I think
 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.930
regarded somewhat heroically and I think
it's important to understand what Mark

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940
it's important to understand what Mark
 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.750
it's important to understand what Mark
felt did and what he didn't do there's a

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760
felt did and what he didn't do there's a
 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.350

to pry information out of him most of
what deepthroat did was confirm

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680
what deepthroat did was confirm
 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.220
what deepthroat did was confirm
information we have gotten elsewhere

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230
information we have gotten elsewhere
 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.650
information we have gotten elsewhere
from other sources and it was invaluable

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660
from other sources and it was invaluable
 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.770
from other sources and it was invaluable
that confirmation because it gave us a

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780
that confirmation because it gave us a
 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.199
that confirmation because it gave us a
certainty that we were right even as

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209
certainty that we were right even as
 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.819

it was a kind of heavy experience to

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.490
it was a kind of heavy experience to
 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.600
it was a kind of heavy experience to
have that going on and and yet we had

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610
have that going on and and yet we had
 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.270
have that going on and and yet we had
the certainty partly because of deep

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280
the certainty partly because of deep
 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.490
the certainty partly because of deep
throat that that we knew our information

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500
throat that that we knew our information
 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.699
throat that that we knew our information
was good and unshakable but in terms of

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709
was good and unshakable but in terms of
 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.490
was good and unshakable but in terms of
original information it came from other

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500
original information it came from other
 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.460
original information it came from other
sources and so this was not and I think

sources and so this was not and I think
 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.140

goes on about this what what really is
 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.150
goes on about this what what really is
extraordinary is that we were able to

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160
extraordinary is that we were able to
 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.550
extraordinary is that we were able to
keep this secret for 30-something years

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560
keep this secret for 30-something years
 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.440
keep this secret for 30-something years
