1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,220
The Joe Rogan experience. There's a
lot of places like that. Um, we're,

2
00:00:05,221 --> 00:00:07,200
we're animals are dependent on people.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,820
They were depending on people to feed
them and it's a, it's a little squirrely.

4
00:00:10,821 --> 00:00:12,300
Like there's a place in,

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,660
I think it's Jamaica where people
swam with wild pigs now while Bahamas.

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:23,190
Bahamas. Yeah. Yeah. No wild pigs
generally avoid people. Yeah.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,620
They don't want to have anything to
do with you and they're dangerous.

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,490
They're sketchy. Yeah. Wild boars
are nuts. Yeah. But in this place,

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,470
people have been feeding
these things for so long.

10
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:34,860
They have trips like tourist
trips where people fly in,

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,500
feed these pigs and swim around with them.
Pig Island,

12
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:40,650
they got wild pigs that are
constantly being fed by people.

13
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,000
But a friend of a friend went there
and someone they were with God bit.

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,450
Oh yeah, I've heard they put them
in the ass a bit. One of the,

15
00:00:48,451 --> 00:00:51,360
one of the pigs bit them in the ass and
it was because they didn't have any food

16
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:53,450
or something like that. Then
didn't offer me any. Thank you.

17
00:00:53,451 --> 00:00:55,040
You have to keep feeding them
throughout the whole thing.

18
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:56,420
It tells you all about it,
that they,

19
00:00:56,421 --> 00:01:00,340
that they get really ornery and they
get really annoyed. Fuck you. Fuck you.

20
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:04,680
Fuck you just drown it. Just put it right
under. Nah, Bro. They're strong. No,

21
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:05,990
they are.
You can't fuck with those scents.

22
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:10,990
Creepy animal because they're beautiful
and they're sweet and the like. Pigs are,

23
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,820
there are weird. One I know has
their look as cool. I'm a dog lover.

24
00:01:15,821 --> 00:01:20,820
I love dogs. Pigs are almost like
a dog and maybe smarter clothes.

25
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,510
Their PR, well, probably
definitely smarter,

26
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,240
but they liked the way that
we react to people. Look,

27
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,640
if you feed them and you're their friend,
you become their buddy,

28
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:31,810
but are you against eating them? No,
but also look, cause I've killed them.

29
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,410
I know they're delicious. Wild ones,
but wild ones are different, man. Right?

30
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,720
Because they're out there
hustling. Okay. They don't,

31
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,860
they're not in this fucking pen getting
slop all day trying to fatten them up.

32
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,560
Right.
It's hard to get fat out there.

33
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:47,020
They're out there so much more lean
meat out there. They're much leaner,

34
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:51,010
but they're also vicious man. They're
V to get, they grow these giant tusks.

35
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:52,510
They have these big fucking fangs.

36
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,910
The thing is they're the same
species as the domestic pit.

37
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,970
So same animal, just once one's, one's
pampered and one's not exactly bring up.

38
00:02:00,971 --> 00:02:02,170
Have you ever seen have Salinas,

39
00:02:02,171 --> 00:02:05,650
do you know what have all the is are so
in Arizona peccary well when I saw that

40
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,040
it looks just like a pig.
That was when I first,

41
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,990
when I first moved to Arizona
I saw one and I was like, oh,

42
00:02:10,991 --> 00:02:13,750
what the fuck is that thing?
And my buddy was like, no,
no, no, don't quote it. They,

43
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:14,860
they'll come right at you.

44
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:18,220
They will fucking go for your legs bad
because they're real low to the ground.

45
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,130
But he's like, they'll start spearing
you and they'll come at your legs.

46
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,910
And one time I was valuing in college and
I was up way in the up in the mountain

47
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,890
and some dudes, you know, some private,

48
00:02:26,891 --> 00:02:29,800
huge private residence and there
with packs, I mean packs of them.

49
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,590
And I could hear them rustling around
and they were like positioning themselves

50
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,190
because I was, we were parking cars
where they were living and I was like,

51
00:02:36,191 --> 00:02:37,120
we can't park cars up there.

52
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:40,030
You can tell they started
to get aggressive in jumping
and diving at the cars.

53
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,640
Yeah, they were getting fucking
annoyed, man. They did. I was like,

54
00:02:42,641 --> 00:02:43,360
we can't go back up there.

55
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,070
We're going to get fucked up
by these little bullshit pigs.

56
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:48,520
You know where Stan hope lives out in
Bisbee, which is real close to the border.

57
00:02:48,521 --> 00:02:50,050
They have them all over the
place yet they're everywhere.

58
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,210
They killed one of his friend's dog.
They do kill dog. They, well they,

59
00:02:53,211 --> 00:02:54,640
they're known to kill cats more,
but yeah,

60
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:57,430
they do kill dogs because dogs are about,
depending on the size of your dog,

61
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,331
there are some of those,

62
00:02:58,331 --> 00:03:01,060
some dogs could those things up
because they're not that big, but they,

63
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,910
they're known as murder cats.
It was a small dog I think,

64
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:07,780
and I think they flanked it and this
came at it from the sides to the park.

65
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,880
The rip apart a dog.
What do you do when someone,

66
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:11,700
something like that kills your dog?
Are you out with a shotgun?

67
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,920
Trying to find the rest of them did.

68
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,450
I was trying to kill coyotes after they
ate my chickens and I don't give, I mean,

69
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,740
I love chickens. Like they're cute.
They're my friends. But when they died,

70
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:23,920
a couple of them died of just natural
causes. Yeah. I'd be like, aw,

71
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:27,490
poor little guy. But if my dog died,
it'd be really sad. You know what I mean?

72
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:29,350
There's, it's a different
relationship, different.

73
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:31,060
So when these coyotes killed my chickens,

74
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:36,061
I sat out there on the porch with a bow
and a rangefinder waiting to fuck them

75
00:03:36,521 --> 00:03:41,350
up for days. I even tied one of the
dead chickens that they killed to a pot,

76
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,530
like a, you know, that you would
plant is in, what are you doing James?

77
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,640
Um,
the Po that you plant things in.

78
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:52,780
And I sat in the middle of the yard
as bait and I sat up there waiting.

79
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,320
One of them came and my daughter
screamed out, a Guy Audi, and I'm like,

80
00:03:56,321 --> 00:04:01,080
God damn got gotta teach her how to hunt.
Like I had that mother fucker that's,

81
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,480
it was inside. He was inside of 40 yards
and he was creeping in. I was like, oh,

82
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:08,370
I had to do is get to my spot and I
would have probably got a shot. Yeah.

83
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,880
How 40 yards. That's a far away was he
was at 40 yards when my daughter scream.

84
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,421
Oh Shit.

85
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:16,990
Well then it was like freaked out so I
stayed up there for a few hours longer.

86
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,900
What's the first, what's the furthest that
you feel comfortable hitting a target?

87
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:25,070
[inaudible] target w you know there's a
difference between something that's the

88
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:30,550
size of a coyote.
Coyote is only like they're not paying,

89
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:35,530
their body might be like a foot, a foot
and a half. They're not big at all.

90
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,800
Yeah, they're tiny from top to
bottom. So what we're trying to,

91
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:42,490
if you're trying to hit them in the
vitals, you don't have a lot to aim at.

92
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,190
It's a very Smith's big
dot. Yeah. You want to be,

93
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,010
you'd want it to be fairly close.
I think about that all the time.

94
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,820
Bow with a rifle, you could
shoot him. It's not that,

95
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,110
that's not something totally different.
I tried to kill him.

96
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,640
I only grew up shooting rifles.

97
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:59,020
I never shot a gun until I
was in my twenties but rifles,

98
00:04:59,021 --> 00:04:59,890
I was so used to shooting.

99
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:04,510
I got so accustomed to shooting it and
then I try to bow once and that was

100
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,180
unbelievably fucking hard. You
should learn. It'd be fun for it.

101
00:05:08,181 --> 00:05:10,570
You can always come here and practice.
I'll come next time.

102
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:13,930
John Dudley comes into town. I'll have
them a hook. You up on attachment. Yeah,

103
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:18,940
they'd love it man. Not even like to
go hunting, but just to shoot targets.

104
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,860
It's really fun. And I like guns though.
That game out there. I do too. Yeah.

105
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,100
That game out there that I have that uh,
techno hunt gay dude.

106
00:05:27,101 --> 00:05:29,830
Once you get into that and
start playing that, what's your,

107
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:34,090
should add a screen fonts. You're fucking
good at it. Oh, fun. I had Corey Anderson,

108
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:35,660
UFC light heavyweight.
He's a bow hunter.

109
00:05:35,661 --> 00:05:38,230
I had him here the other day and he
was playing it cause he could, oh,

110
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:42,550
he's really good. But you could tell me
he practiced. He so fucking elite athlete.

111
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,060
Of course he's going to be a
good thing. Yeah, that's true.

112
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,560
What do they not also fighter?

113
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:52,390
So he's got this discipline mindset
and you know, he's just on the ball.
