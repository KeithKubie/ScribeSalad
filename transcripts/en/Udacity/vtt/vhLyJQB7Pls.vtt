00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
For our second parallel plate problem, we're going to try and write a potential energy equation

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
for some particle in the middle of this electric field here.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Let's imagine that we have some particle with a charge q

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
in the middle of our electric field and this particle is a distance of x

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
away from this negative plate over here.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
For this problem, you can assume that the value of q is positive

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
so this particle will move to the right but it turns out when we get our final answer

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that this choice won't actually matter.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
All right--so now we want to find out what the potential energy is for this charged particle

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
in the middle of the field and just so we're all on the same page

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I'm going to define potential energy to be 0 right here at the negative plate.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You'll remember that we can actually define potential energy to be 0 wherever we want

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
so I could've done it over here or even over here.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
But just for convenience, I'm going to choose this point to be my potential energy equals zero point.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
All right, so now can you tell me what's the formula for finding the potential energy

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
of this particle in this electric field?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Now in your answer, you can use the distance between the two plates d,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
the distance the particle is away from the negative plate x, the charge of the particle q,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
the mass of the particle m, and the strength of this electric field E.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
In your formula, you can use any of these variables

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
but you should only have to use three of them.

00:01:11.000 --> 09:59:59.000
All right. Put your answer here and good luck.
