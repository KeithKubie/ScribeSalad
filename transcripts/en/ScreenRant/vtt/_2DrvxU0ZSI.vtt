00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.060
With film rights spread across three different
studios, Marvel Comics is omnipresent in the

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.300
realm of comic book movies.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:19.010
Just in 2014, fans got four films from three
companies, giving them plenty of opportunities

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.480
to see their favorite heroes on-screen.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.730
More often than not, these flicks are full
of memorable characters we can’t wait to

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:25.730
see in sequels.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.310
Here are Screen Rant’s 5 Favorite Marvel
Movie Heroes.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.310
Star-Lord

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:40.770
A couple years back, few even knew who Star-Lord
was, but now the Guardians of the Galaxy protagonist

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.440
is one of the leading figures of the MCU.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.030
Peter Quill’s admiration for Earth’s pop
culture and strong emotional connections to

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.920
his home planet (and lack of real super powers)
makes it easy for audiences to relate to him.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.899
He’s just an ordinary guy thrown in extraordinary
situations.

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.899
Plus, he has a Han Solo-esque charming rogue
streak about him thanks to the performance

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:58.899
by Chris Pratt.

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.760
A thief with a heart of gold, Star-Lord has
endeared himself to the masses and will be

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.909
around for a long time.

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:09.150
Professor X

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.960
Everybody needs a mentor, and those who attend
Charles Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.910
have one of the finest around in Professor
X. Patrick Stewart was every X-Men fans’

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.509
dream choice for the role, and his performances
in several films showcased why.

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.320
He brought forth many of the qualities we
love about the character, including his compassion

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.890
and strong desire to make the world a better
place.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.670
Xavier is also a phenomenal teacher, giving
frightened mutants a place to call home as

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.540
they learn to master their gifts.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.869
He was even able to connect with Wolverine.

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:43.759
It’s too bad the quality of the films wasn’t
always at the level of Stewart’s talents.

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:44.759
Blade

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.090
Long before Marvel and DC adaptations flooded
theaters, the Blade trilogy first showed how

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.289
live-action comic book films could be a viable
investment.

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.932
Much of their success was due to star Wesley
Snipes, who injected the titular character

00:01:55.932 --> 00:01:59.570
with a sense of cool composure that made him
fun to watch in several breathtaking action

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:00.570
sequences.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.939
Blade’s confident bravado made him stand
out from the crowd and illustrated why he’s

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:06.530
a valuable ally in a fight.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.340
Also, Blade has a deep sense of honor, choosing
to use his half-vampire abilities to protect

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.290
humans instead of preying on them.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.160
That alone makes him a worthwhile hero.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.160
Wolverine

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.170
When a movie’s hero is an indestructible
killing machine, viewers criticize it as boring.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.090
But that’s never been a problem with Hugh
Jackman’s Wolverine.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.580
Thanks to the actor’s unwavering love and
enthusiasm for playing the character over

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.280
and over again, Logan has struck a chord with
audiences.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:38.100
His rugged toughness and fierce sense of loyalty
are traits we love to see in any hero, and

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.216
the mysteries about his past add layers of
emotional complexity and vulnerability to

00:02:40.216 --> 00:02:43.220
the character – making him an interesting
watch.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:50.250
When Jackman faces his inevitable “retirement”
from the part, it will be a sad day indeed.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.250
Iron Man

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.890
The poster boy of the MCU, RDJ’s Tony Stark
is a rock star that has endeared himself to

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.310
fans all across the globe.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.530
His charming wit, high intellect, and smooth
sarcasm make him something of a comic book

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.420
James Bond – in that many people would happily
sign up to be him if they had the chance.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.800
But there’s more to Stark than his snark.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.200
Over the course of the films, he’s learned
the value of selflessness and what it takes

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:18.390
to be a hero, showing that despite his narcissistic
moments, he truly cares about the world.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:26.900
All in all, he’s a fascinating character
to follow, and it will be interesting to see

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.450
how he evolves down the line.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.180
Those are our picks for our five favorite
Marvel movie heroes.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.440
Are there any we missed?
