00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.990
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C..

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.770
&gt;&gt; Dr. John Haskell:
Let me first welcome you

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.840
to the Library, to the
Jefferson Building.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.110
I'm John Haskell, Director
of the Kluge Center.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.350
Our offices are right
through the doors over here.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.970
And we're so happy you came.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.110
I want to start by
introducing Yasmina Sioud.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.220
Who's the Deputy Head of
Press and Public Diplomacy

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.520
for the Delegation

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.240
of the European Union
to the United States.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.590
Yasmina? Right here.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.510
I was like where is she?

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.870
[ Applause ]

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.410
&gt;&gt; Yasmina Sioud:
Oops, can I move this?

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.640
Well, good afternoon, everybody.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.550
I'm delighted to be at
the Kluge Center today

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.310
to hear Kluge Fellow
Davide Ceriani.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.190
Good pronunciation.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.180
Presenting his research
on this fascinating topic.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.180
The growth of Italian-American
culture

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.980
through opera until the 1940s.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.320
I myself was not a Kluge Fellow.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.300
But I also had the chance as
a master's student in the US

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.540
to take advantage of
the Library of Congress.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.660
And its wealth of
documents and materials.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.990
So I, I know how
important this is.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.610
Today's program is a
signature event of the,

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.120
of the European Month
of Culture.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.840
Resulting from a collaboration
between the Kluge Center,

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.310
the Delegation of the European
Union, the Italian Embassy.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.310
And the Italian Cultural
Institute.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.260
As you may know, or
not, the European Month

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.610
of Culture is organized every
year by the European Delegation.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.390
For the month of May and
for the past six years.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.030
And it offers a full month

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.010
of cultural events
highlighting the diversity

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.310
and the innovation.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.200
Cultures of all our 28
countries that are members

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.260
of the European Union.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.170
This year we have close to 100
events in the Washington area.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.040
With participation of
all our 28 embassies

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.530
and multiple US cultural and
educational institutions.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.030
So I would like here to extend
the EU delegation's deepest

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.160
appreciation to the Kluge Center

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.540
for what is now our
third-year collaboration.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.690
In this EU Month of Culture.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.070
So thank you, Dr.
Haskell, for your support.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.460
And for the excellent work
done by Travis Hensley.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.120
I don't know where he is.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.610
But we look forward to many
more years of collaboration.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.790
And I'll leave the floor to Dr.
Haskell for your conversation.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.060
&gt;&gt; Dr. John Haskell: Before
we get to our multimedia show

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.790
which will be led by
Dr. Ceriani over here.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.000
Let me, let me just say a word
or two about the Kluge Center.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.200
We bring in scholars in the
humanities and social sciences

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.230
by appointment of the Librarian
or by competitive processes.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.990
To take advantage of
the library collections.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.100
And we're really
pleased that this event,

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.100
featuring Davide Ceriani,
who is a Kluge Fellow,

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.900
is a part of the
European Month of Culture.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.860
First let me recognize
Emanuele Amendola.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.800
Is Emanuel here yet?

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.100
&gt;&gt; No.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.400
&gt;&gt; He is not?

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.800
Well, he's the [laughter] we
have a longstanding relationship

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.920
with the Director of the Italian
Culture Institute as well

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.360
as with the Embassy of Italy.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.220
And we're grateful
for that relationship

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.010
and its continuation.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.260
Let me turn to Dr. Ceriani.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.710
Who I, who I will
invite up in a second.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:56.620
But I put my notes
about his career,

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.010
it's too long for
me to remember.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.710
[Laughter] He's an Assistant
Professor of Musicology

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.190
at the Department of
Music at Rowan University.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.020
That's in Glassboro, New Jersey.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.440
He received his Ph.D. in
Musicology from Harvard in 2011.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.640
Dr. Ceriani earned his degree
in saxophone at the Conservatory

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.550
at Bologna, in his
native Italy in 1999.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:20.860
And is Laurea Cum Laude at the
University of Florence in 2003.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:26.080
Throughout the 1990s and early
2000s, he performed extensively

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.630
as a saxophone player in Italy,
France, and the United States.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.240
Prior to working at Rowan, he
spent two years, 2011 to '13,

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.540
as a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow
in the Department of Music

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.450
at Columbia University.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.510
Please help me in welcoming
Dr. Ceriani to the-- .

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:53.070
[ Applause ]

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.380
&gt;&gt; Dr. Davide Ceriani:
Alright, thank you.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.900
&gt;&gt; Dr. John Haskell:
Let me start

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.570
with a very general question

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.340
so that we can learn
a little bit more

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.400
about the star of
the show tonight.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.930
Where are you from?

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.710
Tell us a little bit
about your background.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.020
&gt;&gt; Dr. Davide Ceriani: So
originally from Florence.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.260
And so I lived there
throughout high school.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.560
And then at some point,

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.240
even though I was attending
the University of Florence.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.420
But then I started
moving around.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.980
And so through these
European Union programs,

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.160
the [foreign language] I lived
in France and Germany a bit.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.890
And then here in
the United States.

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:37.050
And as a part of this constant
journey for both personal

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.130
and professional reasons.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:44.920
I realized that though there
were three words, I would say.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.920
Three concepts that
always stood with me.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.970
And they were like
identity, first.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.330
And that is who you are and
how you define yourself.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.090
Depending on how
[inaudible] whatever you go.

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.820
Then a matter of alterity,
that is being the other.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.760
How the others view
you in this new context

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.410
where you decide to, to live.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.910
And then acceptance.

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.660
That is how you negotiate
with the issue

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.890
of identity and alterity.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.860
So your identity
versus who you are

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.900
versus what this
new environment is.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:30.560
And to an extent, I
would say this became

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.920
autobiographical research.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.370
Because I realized that
Italians immigrating here.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.120
Although in a totally
different context

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.430
but did a very similar thing.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.420
&gt;&gt; Dr. John Haskell: So you,
I guess it goes without saying

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.850
that you, that you
developed an interest,

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:46.750
an intense interest in opera.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.530
And you know, United States,
when you're a boy growing

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:51.570
up like my father
used to take me.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.040
Before I can even
remember, to baseball games

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.710
at old D.C. Stadium here.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.600
So somehow or another, he was
inculcating this obsession

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.150
with baseball that
continues to today.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.250
For no particularly good reason.

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:04.670
How did you get involved
in opera?

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:05.970
Was it, was it something

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:07.900
that your parents
groomed you into that?

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.700
&gt;&gt; Dr. Davide Ceriani: No,
not at all, [inaudible].

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.700
I have nothing to do or
really do with the music.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.100
My father has a vague interest
in opera, but not really.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.730
No, I wasn't really one of
these kids who start playing

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:22.180
at the age of five, six.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.350
No, it took me quite,
quite a while.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.790
Around 16 I started playing.

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:29.760
In particular, saxophone
[inaudible] earlier,

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.060
some beginning.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.090
It wasn't even an
interest in opera.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:35.980
I listened to opera,
but not really

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.620
as a professional interest.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:42.600
And then by going to the
conservatory, by playing,

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:47.780
I started meeting singers,
attending opera performances,

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.400
and that's how it all started.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.780
Even though I have to
say by going abroad

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:58.040
and having people
asking me about opera,

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.900
the operatic repertory
especially.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:04.990
The Italian composers, and
again, made me even more aware

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:08.210
of how the others
viewed me as an Italian.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.210
As sort of interested in
opera perhaps by default.

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:13.520
And so that kind of
vague interest I had

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.990
in the beginning developed
in something, yeah, more.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:17.290
&gt;&gt; Dr. John Haskell:

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:22.480
You obviously grew a good
crowd with the topic.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.650
So maybe this is an
obvious question.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:26.700
But I'd like to hear
your answers to,

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.690
to why what you're working
on here at the Library.

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:32.240
And why the topic of
this, this session.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.260
Why do you think
that's important to us?

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:35.560
What, why does that matter?

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:38.380
&gt;&gt; Dr. Davide Ceriani: Well
I mean, it's important mainly

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:43.780
to better discuss
crucial period in history

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.130
of migration to this country.

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:49.420
Of course the, the
history of Italy.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:54.200
But also because I realized that
in the secondary literature.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:09:00.050
That there was a lot on the
socioeconomic accomplishments

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:02.320
of the Italians here in the US.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:07.080
But not really as much
about opera itself.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:13.850
In other words, so when,
when Italians came here.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:15.950
They pretty much worked through.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:19.570
So for example, they,
they brought

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:21.710
with them their own language.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:23.840
Which is of course
an important factor

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.820
in defining your own identity.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.510
But it can also be
an isolating factor.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:31.430
And indeed, some of them
kind of isolated themselves

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:32.730
in these Little Italies,

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.680
and didn't even need
to, to get out of them.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.920
Food, of course, it's
another important topic.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.140
And you're going to start
a few books that I read,

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.330
I started for this research.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.930
Simona Frasca, for example has
written some wonderful essays

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:51.400
on the importance of food.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:56.000
Simona Frasca wrote this
book on The Diaspora

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.540
of Neapolitan Musicians
in New York.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:03.100
Although she, as many
other major scholars

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.560
of Italian music in the US.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:10.370
They primarily focused on the
Neapolitan repertory in the US.

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:13.640
This popular repertory
which was hugely successful.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.500
She one chapter on Caruso.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:22.070
But Caruso primarily performing
these Neapolitan songs.

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:25.200
So I realized that there
was a spot missing there.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.650
It was exactly what opera
meant for the Italians.

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:30.370
Particularly in the Northeast.

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:33.780
I would say Boston through
Washington, which was the area

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:37.620
where Italians primarily lived.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.430
So that's how I realized
it was very important.

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:44.650
And Library of Congress had
huge amount of materials to, to,

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:46.370
to work on this topic.

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:49.370
&gt;&gt; Dr. John Haskell: So are
there other specific ways that,

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:51.880
that, that opera was
relevant to immigrants?

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:55.880
And, and, and before
that, you, you,

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.960
I guess generally the
mass migration is what?

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.260
Eighteen-eighty or so?

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.620
In, into the, getting
into the early

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.680
to middle decades
of the 20th century.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.490
What in particular.

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:06.830
Did opera mean anything

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:09.170
in the United States
before Italians came?

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:10.840
&gt;&gt; Dr. Davide Ceriani:
I would say it did,

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:14.650
but it, in a different way.

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:22.380
So before the, the, the 1880s,
1870s, Americans had this sort

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:27.050
of dreamy romantic view of
Italy, thanks to some diaries

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:29.550
of Americans who
traveled through Italy.

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.490
And so they, they wrote them.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:33.800
And lot of people
here read about it.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:38.150
So [inaudible] came up with
these great quote [inaudible].

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:41.160
After the 19th century,
classical buildings of Greece

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.120
and Rome exerted a strong
fascination on American artists,

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.830
courthouses, state
legislatures, railroad stations.

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:52.560
And the dwellings of
the wealthy were erected

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.360
with the imposing-pillared
facades.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.870
And pediments that characterized
Greek and Roman temples.

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:01.350
And for example there were even
not only American architects

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:04.240
were influenced by the
architecture of Italy.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.670
But some Italian
artists came here.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.830
[Inaudible], for example,
came here with the idea

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.530
of building a big
statue of Washington.

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:12.200
He came up with this
[inaudible] he failed

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:16.410
to secure all the
necessary funds.

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:18.620
Brumidi was the author of
the fresco of the "Apotheosis

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:23.050
of Washington, Here in
the US capital next door.

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:27.850
And the first performance
of an opera in its entirety,

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:30.810
in its original language
was [inaudible].

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:33.910
It was Rossini, The
Barber of Seville,

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:37.290
[inaudible] Le Barbier de
Séville, more or less, okay?

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:39.050
We get what, what it is.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:43.080
And following that performance,

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.380
many other major cultural
figures in New York,

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:48.240
including of course the
[inaudible] the author

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.370
of the librettos for three

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:55.000
of most important Mozart
operas promoted this art form.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.540
And eventually these
[inaudible] became more

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:02.800
and more popular type
of entertainment.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.530
This book, Opera on the Road.

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:05.830
&gt;&gt; Dr. John Haskell: This is,

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:07.130
this is well before
the, the mass migration?

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:08.430
&gt;&gt; Dr. Davide Ceriani:
Yes, absolutely.

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:10.540
And the importance
of these two books

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:14.400
of casting opera before
the mass migration is that.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.770
So Katherine Preston
basically argues that

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:19.920
and quite convincingly
that the American elite,

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:25.360
especially New York, tried
to make opera an elitist sort

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.390
of type of entertainment.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:32.780
But they failed because they
essentially they did not have

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.080
enough wealth.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.840
Enough money to run the
operas by themselves.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:39.810
And because here the
state support that existed

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:42.540
in Europe did not exist.

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:45.820
Then they had to draw
in a lot of the people,

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.780
the poorer people, making
the prices affordable.

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:50.230
And [inaudible] argues

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:52.770
that there was democracy
of the opera.

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:55.450
Because even though you would
see the different classes

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:56.750
at the opera.

00:13:56.750 --> 00:14:00.380
But you also needed
this, everyone in there.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:02.010
And that's part of
my key argument

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:04.650
that this before
the mass migration,

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:09.850
attending opera was
primarily about class.

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:14.870
When it comes to after or during
the mass migration period.

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:18.480
It becomes matter of
race or better ethnicity.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.550
That is a lot of
these ethnic groups,

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:23.400
including the Italians
as I'll show later.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.940
They showed up to
support their folks.

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:30.510
And that's part of this
major change they had.

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:33.200
So this is pretty much what
happened in the 19th century.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.890
This Music Academy was
established in 1884.

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:42.070
Throughout 1850s, '60s,
throughout the '80s,

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:47.520
Italian opera was really the
dominant type of repertory.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.320
Until we get to the 1880s.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.090
And when, to make
the story short,

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:54.610
the Academy of Music
was challenged

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:57.000
by what nowadays we
call the Met Opera.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.180
By the way, Met Opera not
the one we see nowadays.

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.460
But the one that's
on Broadway and 39th

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.000
and 40th, old buildings.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.880
And even though at
the beginning,

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.080
both opera houses
performed Italian opera.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.830
At some point, right
at the beginning,

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:13.780
those who run the Met Opera say,

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:17.200
"Why don't we try to
change the focus?"

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.000
And they started primarily
performing German Opera,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.320
focusing on Wagner.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:24.630
But why? Because they knew
that especially in New York

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:28.160
at the time, there were
about 250,000 people

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.010
of German heritage who
would be totally willing

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:32.460
to support this repertory.

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:35.490
And this is how the
seven-year period

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:37.860
of the Germanized
opera house started.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:41.700
&gt;&gt; Dr. John Haskell: So on the,
on the, when people were going

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:43.920
to Italian opera in
the middles decades

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.490
of the 19th century, were they?

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:47.420
When you got a program,
do you know if it--

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:50.440
was it, were there translations?

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.390
Or more just about
the pageantry?

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:53.820
&gt;&gt; Dr. Davide Ceriani:
No, I mean the,

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.590
so there were various
levels of commitments.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:16:02.670
But I would say that they knew
of the, the basic of the story.

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.060
Most of the people
who attended it.

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:08.000
There were certainly some
translations of an even quality.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.110
But I'm sure people
made the effort.

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:13.870
And a lot of, yeah,
depending on what,

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:17.140
what class you belonged to.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:20.420
[Inaudible] the wealthiest even
the owners would say the opera

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:24.840
house would have a better
understanding and appreciation.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:30.280
But one aspect that really
I, particularly impressed

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:36.040
by that concerning the interest
that people had in opera.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.600
In the, in the Northern
California area,

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.580
during the gold rush.

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:44.880
During the period,
when 90 to 95%

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.620
of people were men living there.

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:48.340
Opera was hugely popular.

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:51.540
And that's [inaudible] how
much people wanted opera.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:54.420
How many singers traveled there.

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:57.450
And so that was the
situation in an area

00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:59.260
that still had to be urbanized.

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.630
Can you imagine that kind
of interest that existed

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:05.110
in New York and Philadelphia
and Washington?

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:07.450
&gt;&gt; Dr. John Haskell: So
slight switch of gears.

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:10.690
So now we're getting into the
period of the mass migration.

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:13.250
So we have a lot of
Italians, Italian-Americans.

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:15.830
Do you have examples?

00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:18.040
When you know, you've been
researching here at the library

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:21.280
on how the press here
and the music critics.

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.370
As, as well as the,
you know, frankly,

00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:25.880
the Italian music
critics reacted

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.540
in those days during
the mass migration.

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.890
To singers and opera
more generally?

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:32.410
&gt;&gt; Dr. Davide Ceriani:
Yeah, I would say, yes.

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:36.320
I do, and we'll, I'll show
some pictures in a moment.

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:41.910
But before we do that, I wanted
to show these list of critics.

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:44.250
The first three, Fink,
Henderson, [inaudible].

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:49.380
So these were the five most
important music critics

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.750
in the United States.

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:54.140
Well, primarily operas
we are talking about.

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:59.380
East Coast, New York
and some Philly area.

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:01.210
In the late 19th and
early 20th century.

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:02.770
Why is this list important?

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:04.800
Because the first three,
Fink, Henderson, [inaudible].

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.560
As you can tell, they
were pretty much born

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:08.860
around the same time.

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:10.420
They started their
professional life

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:12.740
as critics around the same time.

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:15.880
Exactly at a time where there
were these quote/unquote

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.990
"the Germanized opera house."

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:22.270
Also they were either of German
origins or they spent time

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:25.540
in Germany studying composition.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:28.430
And of course studying German.

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:33.130
So to them, opera, the classical
opera, was really German opera.

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.470
Was the Wagner repertory.

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:38.160
And this is why the Italian
opera, after enjoying

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.520
so much popularity during the,

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:43.580
before [inaudible] the
Italian mass migration.

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:46.750
Had such a hard time to
be positively advertised

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:49.050
in the American press.

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:53.070
Aldrich was a bit more balanced,
and Smith was actually,

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:55.190
probably the one who was most
in favor of the Italians.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:57.660
He was actually the only
one that the conductor,

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.350
Arturo Toscanini, trusted.

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:01.310
So it was like he wouldn't
really talk to the others.

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:03.950
But he made an effort
to talk to them.

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:07.690
Anyway, this said, let's
go through some examples

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:11.210
on how the American press and
the Italian-language press

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:12.510
in particular in this case.

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:14.560
Is based in New York.

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.580
Reacted to the exact same work.

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.910
So here we The Sun, so Henderson
writing this [inaudible]

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:26.520
in 1913 is the one
[inaudible] and [inaudible]

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.630
who was the general
manager of the Met Opera,

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:31.690
decides to stage [inaudible].

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:36.820
Now, as you can read there,
like Mr. Caruso at his best.

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:40.800
Presented with a strong cast,
[inaudible] and costumes.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.560
Now one has to read
between the lines.

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:47.770
In other words, when a
critic was not particularly

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:50.350
appreciative of a, of an opera,

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:53.840
at least the headlines
said something positive

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.710
about the performers.

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:57.490
About the scenery,
about the costume.

00:19:57.490 --> 00:19:59.420
That is to say, [inaudible].

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:02.830
But still, as, you know,

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:05.550
the [inaudible] a
good job doing that.

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:10.110
If you begin and start reading
at some specific passages,

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:12.240
let's see what happens.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.240
[Inaudible] many
absurdities of the libretto.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:20.520
Or it is the kind of
music to which is beloved

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.630
of people devoted to the
elementary things in art.

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:24.930
It's talking about Italians.

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:27.000
I can show you, I have
proof of that later.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.510
And much of the [inaudible]
style of Verdi-- .

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:54.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:55.730
Okay, that's American side.

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:58.860
Let's see what happens in
the Italian-language press.

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:00.160
[Inaudible] trust me, this is

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.510
about the exact same
performance, same day.

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:07.080
[ Inaudible ]

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:08.940
&gt;&gt; Last Saturday, we had
the [foreign language]

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:14.510
which has drawn away an
immense public of 4000 people

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:16.570
who gather in religious silence.

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:19.570
In the vast hall of
the Metropolitan.

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:23.160
And basically through
the same divine emotions

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:27.730
of this unanimous enthusiasm to
which it was [inaudible] public

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:30.860
in such a different
context, 54 years ago.

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:33.110
Which was the first performance
of [foreign language].

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:39.800
Only the genius, Verdi,
destined to immortality,

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.930
can make this miracle possible.

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:43.230
Is it the same performance?

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:44.530
Yes, it is.

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:47.030
And this is, so this
keeps happening

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:48.530
over and over and over.

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:49.900
This is one year later
in [foreign language].

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.310
I don't know if I
need to translate it,

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:54.810
but it's pretty much, it.

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:56.110
This is not the same
performance.

00:21:56.110 --> 00:22:01.510
But even before [inaudible] so
[foreign language] 1914, 1915.

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:05.070
[ Inaudible ]

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:08.010
Another example and
then we move on.

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:13.030
So [inaudible] Giordano,
composer of later composer

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:16.150
of late 19th, early 20th
century from the [inaudible].

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:21.990
In 1915, comes up
with this opera,

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:25.760
[foreign language] setting the,
around the Napoleonic Period.

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.550
Here we see a similar
kind of rhetoric.

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:30.070
Splendid cast.

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:34.320
The great scene effect, But
music in the military style.

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:37.990
Kind of simple type
of repertory.

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:41.370
Giordano's score not
above previous level.

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:44.260
Which is kind of a way to say,
"Well, he did what he could.

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:46.570
But not really a very
successful opera."

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:49.640
Giordano's score not
inspiring melody.

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.230
And I picked these
especially because later,

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:53.360
we're going to see
something about the melody

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.110
in the Italian-language press.

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:57.720
Now, Italian-language
press, [foreign language].

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:01.830
The immense success of
Umberto Giordano's work.

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:04.430
A great triumph of Italian art,

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:07.830
thanks to [inaudible] the
Italian general manager

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:09.130
of the Met.

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:11.980
This sort of rhetoric,
Italian composer,

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.770
triumph of Italian art ,or
something that constantly happen

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:16.380
over and over and over.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:18.710
This one is the part
that I prefer.

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:22.170
After each performance,
the Italian press would,

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:27.730
in this case [foreign language]
would cherry-pick passages

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:30.440
from the American press.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.430
Taken totally out of context.

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:34.710
And [inaudible] a positive.

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:37.440
They'll say everything
was bad except for this.

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:41.530
And so this is, and this
was, these were articles

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:44.500
for the members of
the Italian community

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:46.540
that they wanted believed,

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:48.470
the newspapers wanted
them to believe.

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:51.900
That everything had gone great
at the, at the performance.

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:53.800
So people either could
not read English.

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.110
Or did not both enough.

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:56.410
&gt;&gt; Dr. John Haskell: Yeah,
you've got to be careful

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:58.010
because there's people in this
room who, who depend on that

00:23:58.010 --> 00:23:59.860
for blurbs on their books.

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:01.160
&gt;&gt; Dr. Davide Ceriani:
That's great!

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.740
Again, it's [inaudible]
100 years ago.

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:04.040
So it's all good.

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.980
Now I'm sure that everything
is totally different.

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.430
Actually, one thing
that we notice is

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:11.430
that this is small parenthesis
about an important one.

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:16.510
Is that opera has an importance
back then only comparable

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:19.210
to what Hollywood is today.

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:22.080
Like the amount of space
literally that you find

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:25.580
in both the American newspapers,
Italian-language newspaper.

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:30.370
Even like German-language
newspaper were easily comparable

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:35.860
to that section about Hollywood
actors and the Hollywood movies.

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:37.160
With the main difference

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:41.220
that now we have primarily
American actors acting

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:43.300
in Hollywood movies.

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:46.510
Back then we were
primarily having European,

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:47.810
not only of course,

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:52.050
but primarily European singers
coming here to have success.

00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:55.120
And that indeed created
the sort of tension

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:58.770
that [inaudible] especially
in connection with Caruso.

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:01.050
Anyway, just a few notes just

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:04.510
to show you how this
rhetoric changed

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:06.290
in the Italian-language
newspapers.

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:12.000
So we have this American press
had words of great enthusiasm

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.140
for the opera of
Maestro Giordano.

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:17.000
And they recognized, the
American journalists,

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.220
that Madame Sans-Gene
contains wonderful [inaudible].

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:23.750
But for the modernity of the
technique, musical techniques.

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:27.170
And the freshness and
originality of melody

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:29.160
which is exactly the
part that we saw earlier

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:32.700
that wasn't terribly
successful one.

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:37.320
Now what happened when the
German repertory was performing?

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.860
In general, the reviews

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:44.140
in the Italian newspaper were
not particularly positive.

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:46.960
Unless these were in
the hands or conducted

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.010
by an Italian conductors.

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:53.640
And this is the case of
Toscanini who [foreign language]

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.660
as the last part
of the [inaudible].

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:58.970
The last part of the
[inaudible] of Wagner.

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:03.310
And of course Toscanini
triumphs with the [inaudible]

00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:06.790
that he's noted to
triumph thanks

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:09.030
to the Italian conductors.

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:11.170
So there is a victory thanks
to the ingenious Italian

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:12.620
of the Metropolitan Opera.

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:14.970
And of course the
American press is totally,

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:17.450
like agrees in admiring
Toscanini,

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:19.470
not necessarily Wagner.

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:21.270
Same story.

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:25.640
[ Inaudible ]

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:28.710
Before Toscanini, not as much.

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:30.090
[Laughter] Finally,
what happened

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:32.730
with American composers?

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:35.150
This is very interesting
because in general,

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:38.630
it's true that American opera
has not been as successful.

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:39.960
Not here in the US.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:43.080
And not here in the US as much
as the Italian, the French,

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.380
or the German repertory.

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:48.540
But there was in general a
movement of American critics

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:50.880
who wanted more American opera.

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:54.530
Or at least foreign opera
performed in English.

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:57.980
But also they wanted some
American composers being staged

00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:59.780
at the Met.

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.700
So these, [inaudible] as part
of this rhetoric was someone

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.230
that says, "We don't want
opera in French or in German.

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:08.210
We want it in the vernacular
that is in, in English."

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:12.410
At one point, [inaudible] some
sort gives into this pressure

00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:17.030
and agrees to, to stage an
opera by Horatio Parker.

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:21.190
And American composer
who was teaching at Yale.

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:23.440
So one of the most prestigious.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:26.680
And agrees to stage
this opera, Mona.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:31.570
M-o-n-a. At the Met with
an expense of about $40,000

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:33.050
which translates nowadays

00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:36.000
to about one million
dollars, a major performance.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.770
See how the Italian
press reacts to that.

00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:41.070
[Foreign language]
writes of Parker,

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:44.630
Mona is $40,000 thrown at sea.

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:49.610
[Laughter] Just to see how
welcome the American press was

00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:54.930
toward these new, these
American repertory.

00:27:54.930 --> 00:28:00.470
I also thought as I pointed
to briefly discuss something.

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:03.190
Because this year is
the 100th anniversary

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:05.400
of the first performance
of Puccini [inaudible].

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:09.370
A series of three short operas
that were premiered here

00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:13.010
in 1919, here in the
US at Met in 1918.

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:15.910
And pretty much we follow
a similar kind of rhetoric.

00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:19.750
A great artistic events of
the Metropolitan Opera House.

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:21.050
Three new operas.

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:25.250
The American press was a bit
more skeptical in the sense

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:30.430
that they remember the Puccini
of Tosca, Madame Butterfly,

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:32.810
so like the, the
great successes here,

00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:34.930
the late 19th, early
20th century.

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:37.620
But they were not terrible
happy with these new operas

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:40.090
because it was missing
these belle canto,

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:45.110
the beautiful singing
type of style.

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:48.550
And indeed only the last one
of the [foreign language]

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:51.540
which is the, the comic opera

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:53.690
with the [inaudible]
the famous aria.

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:56.960
Was the one that was
appreciated overall.

00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:00.070
Otherwise, it's powerful
in conception,

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:03.640
but melody quality is not
ingratiating except again,

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:07.040
for this last, last one.

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:11.340
So that's, and then, I
would say a few words

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:13.180
about Caruso is probably worthy.

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:18.000
In the sense that we think of
Caruso as this hero figure.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.390
So the one that was able

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:22.690
to bring together the Italian
communities and the Americans.

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:24.580
And everybody was
happy with him.

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:28.780
And he was a great figure
that everybody agreed upon.

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:30.600
Not as much or better.

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:34.710
Some of the aspects that I will
mention here are relatively

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:36.010
well known.

00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:38.280
But they certainly
deserve a closer look

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:42.370
to show a different side
of Caruso or better.

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:45.340
The difference in Caruso
and how he was perceived

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:46.640
by the American press.

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.140
So here I'm showing
the, the again,

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:50.500
what we know about Caruso.

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:51.960
Grandiose event of
Italian [inaudible].

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.900
Caruso stands there
in the middle

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:55.860
between Toscanini
and [inaudible].

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.940
This was the first,
the first performance

00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:00.400
of [inaudible] at the Met.

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.510
Just a few quotes from
[foreign language].

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:07.210
[ Inaudible ]

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:11.960
And then these another title
that proves how Italians knew

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:16.390
of Caruso even before
he came to, to New York.

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:18.550
[Inaudible] was actually
the impresario,

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:23.040
the one who ran the Met who
brought Caruso to the Met.

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.950
Here is Caruso in Little Italy.

00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:31.660
He has people around who took
care of, took care of him.

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:34.160
How do we know this
is Little Italy?

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:40.500
Well, that [inaudible]
there at the top is clearly

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:44.540
like southern Neapolitan accent

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:47.620
which has these [inaudible]
it's called the [inaudible].

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:56.650
In the English, a-p,
a-p-o-c-o-p-e and is pretty much

00:30:56.650 --> 00:31:00.310
like dropping through a
process of [inaudible].

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:01.870
The last vowel of the word.

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:05.810
It's like a typical
element of the dialect

00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:07.370
of the Neapolitan in particular.

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:10.120
And we know that
Neapolitans who are

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:13.720
like prominent in
the Little Italy.

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:17.190
So all these drawings,
they're kind of nice, you know,

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:19.070
with Caruso eating
the spaghetti.

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:20.870
And so I know, I know.

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:24.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:27.220
And we also know that
he liked the spaghetti,

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:28.520
the lamb, the [inaudible].

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:31.830
It's all good, the
kind of drawings

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:34.680
which I find quite you
know, nice and funny.

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:38.990
And just-- what they find
much more disturbing.

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:41.520
And here I need to open a
little, well, it's [inaudible].

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:42.820
It's a fact.

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:45.170
It was the Monkey House scandal.

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:47.500
What was the Monkey
House scandal?

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:50.850
Caruso came here to
this country in 1903.

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:53.110
Had great success
at the beginning.

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:56.890
Then I think, '06,
he was convicted,

00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:58.380
essentially for molestation.

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:02.540
For you know [inaudible]
touching a woman at this,

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:05.140
the Bronx Zoo in New York.

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:06.610
He professed his innocence.

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:08.740
This woman said no.

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:11.190
He actually did that to me.

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:14.420
In the end of this
very disturbing story,

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:18.830
he was convicted but with a
fine that was basically a joke

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:22.210
of $10, the equivalent
of $250 nowadays.

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:24.940
Someone who earned five
million dollars a season,

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:26.240
it was pretty much nothing.

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.490
So it pretty much the
worst possible decision.

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:32.110
Because on the one hand,
he was convicted as guilty

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:34.860
for something that he always
said, "I didn't do it."

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.540
And this woman pretty
much say this guy kind

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:39.490
of walking away if
that was true.

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:43.830
It was like basically doing
a great injustice to her.

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:46.070
Stanley Jackson wrote
this biography.

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:47.880
He's not a musicologist.

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:51.840
He's a lawyer, and
this book is from 1972.

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:55.120
And this is the first part,
how he describes the Italian.

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:58.510
"Caruso did not pinch the
woman or even touching her.

00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:01.100
He assets that she smile at him,

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:02.970
and he had to smile
back politely.

00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:06.230
Surprisingly, she was not called
as a witness and basically

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:07.660
because this woman
said, "Well, I,

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:11.300
Caruso's friends are dangerous."

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:16.110
Now before I show
you next, next image.

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:17.940
Another quote from the book.

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:21.700
Keep in mind that
this is a book if not

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:23.100
like totally scholarly book.

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:26.420
But a book written by
this lawyer, and published

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:30.160
by a very well-respected
New York publisher.

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:32.880
So something that [inaudible]
has supposedly a peer

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.180
review process.

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:38.690
Here is what this
person says, 1972.

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:42.660
"Fondling or tweaking a
ladies' behind was and remains

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:46.530
so prevalent [inaudible]
in Italy and Latin America.

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:50.480
That he, Caruso, might
well have instinctively

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:54.160
and without considering it
more than a playful kiss."

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:58.030
Now, why do I show this,
this obscenity over here?

00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:00.860
If this was the kind of
rhetoric, this thing happened

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:05.710
in 1972 in a, less call
it a scholarly book.

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:09.580
Can you imagine what kind of
rhetoric what was going on in,

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:13.480
you know, people just
talking to each other in 1906?

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:17.110
It was the kind of rhetoric
that brought to this.

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:19.910
Caruso's offered a bodyguard
by Sicilian relatives.

00:34:19.910 --> 00:34:24.730
[Inaudible] between the two
Sicilians with the radio,

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:28.800
with the knives to stab, I
guess, anyone who's you know,

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.650
could potentially
threaten his reputation.

00:34:31.650 --> 00:34:34.080
By the way, dates say 1907.

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:37.820
I'm sorry, like it's 1906 of
course right after the event.

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:42.870
So in a sense, again, after
this event which everyone later,

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:45.000
the press, they tell
American community

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.320
that they all try to
swipe like behind.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:49.630
&gt;&gt; Dr. John Haskell:
Under the rug.

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:50.930
&gt;&gt; Dr. Davide Ceriani:
Under the rug, thank you.

00:34:50.930 --> 00:34:52.230
That's the expression.

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:54.440
And they came to the
worst possible outcomes

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:55.850
for the reasons I said before.

00:34:55.850 --> 00:34:58.550
And because of course
this wrote these series

00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:59.950
of drawings, I just picked one.

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:01.250
But there are many others.

00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:05.760
Against the Italian
community of, of New York.

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:09.060
And these again, an event
that was very disturbing.

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:13.230
That is certainly not discussed
as much as it was back then.

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:14.710
But it certainly it's something

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:17.770
that brought a [inaudible] not
only on Caruso's reputation.

00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:20.300
Again, it should
have had some negat--

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:23.280
very negative consequences
on him since it happened.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:26.600
But more in general, the
Italian community had much

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:29.330
to do with that.

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:33.420
Caruso also, [inaudible]
singer that as I said earlier,

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:35.610
a lot of these singers
who were as popular

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:38.420
as actors in these days.

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:41.750
So a lot of the American
newspapers thought

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:43.640
of the singers, and
Caruso more than others.

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:47.790
Because he was the one who made
more money than anyone else.

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:50.900
Depicting him as the one who
was only interested in dollars.

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:54.650
So they are newspapers
showed much

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:56.700
of the earnings of these people.

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:59.960
Caruso, so $200,000
as I said earlier.

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:04.910
Translates roughly into the five
million per season nowadays.

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:07.140
And finally, well,
is this funny?

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:08.440
I don't think that much.

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:09.740
But let me give you a context.

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:15.000
At some point, Caruso was asked
by the Italian-American mafia

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.530
to pay a certain
amount of money.

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:20.940
He initially agreed
for a lower amount.

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:24.470
When they asked for more, he
reported that to the police.

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:29.570
And so these people were
brought to, to, to, to court

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:30.870
and eventually jailed.

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:33.520
That the black hand
was actually,

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:37.140
many people confuse here,
they suppose the black hand

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:39.510
with the Italian-American mafia.

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:41.350
But in reality, the
black hand was

00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:46.270
like how the mafia sent these
letters with these like hands.

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:50.410
And very often with a knife
as well to threaten the people

00:36:50.410 --> 00:36:52.790
in order to make them pay.

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:56.220
And so all of these American
newspapers wants Caruso

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:58.890
denounced this fact
that he was protected

00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:00.460
by the police everywhere.

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:03.510
And so they, they tried to be
[inaudible] with the police-- .

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:10.060
[ Inaudible ]

00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:11.360
This is another example.

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.400
Caruso caged during
the performance.

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:16.070
And again the, the
police with the guns.

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:17.370
So is this funny?

00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:19.460
Well, I mean, you look at
things like that, it is funny.

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:22.030
But it is funny if it
doesn't touch you personally.

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:23.590
Many people in the, the,

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:26.650
the Italian-American community
were unfortunately touched

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:28.600
by this phenomenon.

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:32.810
It's this kind of
funny in a sense

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:35.550
but also disturbing
on the other.

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:39.030
In the end, when we talk about
Caruso, I think we are talking

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:43.200
about a performer that
for the Americans and all,

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:48.080
it wasn't really a threatening
figure among this community

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:51.440
of Italians that
moved here to the US.

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:54.850
But he was not, as well
as were not the Italians

00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:57.420
who performed on stage.

00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:00.600
When someone like
[inaudible] was asked

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:04.450
to actually run an opera house,
well, we'll see what happened.

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:07.930
And I'd like to close this
part with this funny video

00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:11.530
of Caruso trying to ingratiate
himself to the American audience

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:12.830
by making these faces.

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:17.050
It kind of gives us
a sense of yeah, how,

00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:18.590
of these very expressive faces

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:21.550
that he did, he made
on, on stage.

00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:22.930
&gt;&gt; Dr. John Haskell: So you
know, the Kluge Center, as,

00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:24.230
as many people in the room know.

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:26.970
But perhaps not everybody that
we will have at any given time.

00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:29.790
You know, we could have as many
as 30 scholars in residence,

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:31.160
about what we have right now.

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:33.250
And, and there's a, you know,
of course a lot of interaction.

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:34.590
That's part of the point.

00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:38.130
And what we hear from this
gentleman is, is a conversation

00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:40.290
about hey, I'm finding
these autobiographies

00:38:40.290 --> 00:38:41.690
of Italian immigrants.

00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:44.710
And that's you know an
important part of his research.

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:48.080
And I was hoping
that you could speak

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:52.120
to how these autobiographies
are, are informing your research

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:55.060
into the perception of Italian
opera by Italian-Americans.

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:56.360
&gt;&gt; Dr. Davide Ceriani: Yeah!

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:57.660
Absolutely!

00:38:57.660 --> 00:38:59.760
I would say this was one of the
three most important outcomes

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:02.570
of this research
in my time here.

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:06.540
What I'm going to do is
going to show a few quotes.

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:08.490
And then explain
why these quotes

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:10.730
in particular are so important.

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:12.030
Pascal D'Angelo's, one

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:15.290
who became a very well
respected author, writer,

00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:16.790
and poet here in the US.

00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:20.700
Describes in this
autobiography of him

00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:22.560
as an immigrant to the US.

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:25.660
Eventually becoming again
a successful writer.

00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:27.170
How he discovered opera.

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:30.350
And this story, it's very
common among the Italians.

00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:32.990
So he says that during
the summer of 1919.

00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:36.640
I began to hear much about
the Aida, so Verdi's Aida

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:39.750
but did not know
exactly what it was.

00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:45.520
So [inaudible] friend of him
[inaudible] had been to see it.

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:48.300
But he was unable to tell
me much about it except

00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:51.540
that it was a fine
parade in it which is

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:53.600
of course the [inaudible],
Act Two.

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:55.430
So about the same time
happened to glance

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:57.500
over at Italian newspapers.

00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.590
You know, how he can
learn about the opera.

00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:03.030
And saw an advertisement that
his opera was represented

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:07.840
in open-air at the Sheep
Shed Bay Racetrack.

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:09.160
I decided to go and hear it.

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:10.960
And I went by asking my way--

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:13.850
basically the entry
because he's from Brooklyn.

00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:16.510
And then I heard these
supreme melodies around me.

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:19.430
I felt the impulse to
rush home to our boxcar

00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:21.230
and compose another Aida.

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:24.300
Even though I didn't
know much about music.

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:26.810
And [inaudible] music,
it's kind of difficult

00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:28.800
to write something like Aida.

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.560
In this autobiography
keeps trying, he fails.

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:33.940
And that's how he
decides to become a poet.

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:39.160
Of course [inaudible] but of
course he had to change career.

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.870
[Inaudible] was a very well
respected Italian-American.

00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:45.660
Scholars describe something
from his own personal life.

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:47.510
That he's this [inaudible]
the Verdi.

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:53.050
[ Inaudible ]

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:56.740
By the way, in the other
room, we have artifacts.

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:59.400
We have books, scores,
and the phonograph

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:01.320
if you wish to take
a look later.

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:03.710
He must have had an
extraordinary ear for music

00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:05.650
because the [inaudible]
of the children

00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:07.750
and [inaudible] usually
coincided

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:09.550
with the climaxes of Aida.

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:12.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:13.340
He favored the most.

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:14.640
All of them of course,
Verdi's opera.

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:20.650
Last example, [inaudible]
describing her grandfather.

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:24.280
When the [inaudible] Americano,
I reported a particular success

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:25.750
of the Metropolitan Opera House.

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:27.960
He, her grandfather,
would buy a recording

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:31.510
of his favorite arias sung
by his favorite artists.

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:34.150
[ Foreign Language ]

00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:36.540
And then she described how
she learned about opera.

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:39.440
Now, why are these
passages so important?

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:40.740
And why do I pick them?

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:44.200
Well, one talks about
Italians going to the opera

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:46.510
that is attending
the opera live.

00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:49.810
And as I'll show later,
sticking altogether in order

00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:51.460
to support their performers.

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:53.770
The other one in the middle is

00:41:53.770 --> 00:41:57.020
about the private
enjoyment of opera.

00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:59.320
Having a phonograph

00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:02.340
and basically having the
operas perform there as a sort

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:07.570
of collective, a sonic
experience as a collective rite.

00:42:07.570 --> 00:42:10.250
Even during you know
the normal situation

00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:12.110
with children running and so on.

00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:15.090
And the other is about Italians
reading the Italian-American

00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:17.700
newspapers and learning
through them

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:20.770
about these operatic
performances.

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:24.700
So we all knew that
that happened.

00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:28.640
But what these experiences at
Kluge allowed me was the time

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.970
to find plenty of evidence.

00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:32.350
I limited it to three.

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:34.460
But we found those.

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:36.800
And my friend Katherine
[inaudible] because it's

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:39.260
when we were on the, we
were on the opposite side.

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:41.660
So we were on the
[inaudible] of our cubicles.

00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:43.600
And every time I would find
one, I was like, "Ha-ha!"

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:47.340
And she knew that I had
found a new, a new one.

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:50.250
[Laughter] I was [inaudible]
there when these happened.

00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:54.880
Now, and another very compelling
evidence that I found was images

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:57.010
of Italians going to the opera.

00:42:57.010 --> 00:42:58.310
And here we go.

00:42:58.310 --> 00:43:01.350
So well the one there
you're seeing is clearly

00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:02.650
[inaudible] Caruso.

00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:05.280
This from the Chicago
Daily News from 1910.

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:08.260
And up there we have
these very moved Italians.

00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:11.340
So I know how they are Italians
and the mom might even cry.

00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:12.790
Of course the seats
were very cheap,

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:14.700
but very much into
the performance.

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:17.940
And we see at the bottom
like the most expensive seat.

00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:20.090
The other seats that
we know were the areas

00:43:20.090 --> 00:43:22.090
where the wealthiest
Americans, sometimes.

00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:24.630
Those who literally
own the opera house.

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:26.330
They don't care that much.

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:28.520
Oh, this guy is performing,
whatever he's doing.

00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:29.820
[Laughter] We don't know.

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:32.660
It's, you know, it's kind of
funny to see these contrasts.

00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:35.500
Now another evidence, 1908.

00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:37.420
This is the Manhattan
Opera House.

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:40.110
This is a performance
of [foreign language].

00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:44.730
And here is the close-up with
the gallery most of Italian.

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:46.880
And the de-- again
like the title,

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:50.200
as I show earlier is with,
with Italy on the Italians

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:53.590
that gathered up
there, presumably right

00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:55.250
after performance of aria
of [foreign language].

00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:58.100
Like very overexcited.

00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:01.960
Very happy that she did
a great performance.

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:06.230
And this is supposedly your
average Italian reacting

00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:08.230
to an Italian performer.

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:10.880
Apparently like [inaudible]
prima Dona [inaudible]

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:14.510
for New York Herald.

00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:32.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:37.140
Describes these very happy
Italian at the performance.

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:44.980
This one it's supposedly
the Metropolitan Opera House

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:46.280
in the, the.

00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:47.740
So this, this is something

00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:51.160
that has already been
published in, in a book.

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:53.140
And according to the
caption of this book.

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:54.940
This is a -- .

00:44:54.940 --> 00:45:01.650
[ Inaudible ]

00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:05.980
Now I had a chance once to
talk to Toscanini's grandson

00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:07.400
who could have told
me more about it.

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:09.980
Unfortunately, I didn't have
the chance to talk a little.

00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:11.810
And unfortunately, he died
a couple of years ago.

00:45:11.810 --> 00:45:15.320
But we trust this book that
this is exactly what happened.

00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:16.990
Okay, more images
about Italians.

00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:19.520
If you don't mind, maybe I
should briefly read these.

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:23.750
And then we move
onto something else.

00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:27.630
So this is how the Musical
America described Italians

00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:30.300
staying at the opera in 1909.

00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:33.660
They came out from the Little
Italy on the East Side,

00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:34.960
where the Met Opera is.

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:36.970
They come out from the
[inaudible] spaghetti

00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:38.270
on the West Side.

00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:40.440
And they crowded into the
Met Opera Monday night

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:43.820
until they stood four and
five deep in the [inaudible]

00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:46.360
at the gallery, up there.

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:49.700
They had come to welcome their
great compatriot, Caruso,

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:52.460
and they were prepared to
stop the action of the opera.

00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:54.020
When he appeared on the stage

00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:56.290
and shout [inaudible]
et cetera, et cetera.

00:45:56.290 --> 00:45:59.030
So the point of this
article makes essentially.

00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:00.940
The Italians only know
one kind of music.

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:04.980
And they show up for their
own, their own operas.

00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:09.550
In a sense this sort of makes
it even more compelling.

00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:12.710
The argument I made earlier
that we were moving from class

00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:16.000
or race or ethnicity because
this kind of rhetoric.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.920
Even though it was not so
clearly phrased, but it had been

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:22.220
for the German as well.

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:23.520
For the Czechs as well.

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:26.540
For all those immigrants
who by night feel

00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:31.800
that the opera part is the least
expensive part of the Met Opera.

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:35.230
And again, all the evidence
of this wonderful example is

00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:37.490
of the Boston Opera House.

00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:40.810
It's something that
further proves this point.

00:46:40.810 --> 00:46:46.200
Finally, I'd like to discuss a
bit, so we'll listen some music

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:50.090
on how opera was popularized.

00:46:50.090 --> 00:46:53.810
Opera was popularized of course
through this aria recorded.

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:57.400
And then being like you
know sold as a phonograph.

00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:01.690
But also a key element that we
often forget nowadays was the

00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:04.980
band culture when, that
was so popular in the US.

00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:06.280
It was of course in Italy.

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:10.140
So the Italians recreated
these bands here in the US.

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:13.190
Let's see, here we have the
cities and associations.

00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:15.630
This one was in Oswego,
New York.

00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:16.930
Pueblo, Colorado.

00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:20.570
This was the [inaudible]
band in Boston.

00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:25.700
And all these band
conductors, in order to,

00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:27.560
to have success basically.

00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:29.160
To sell their recordings.

00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:34.610
They started transcribing
passages from operas.

00:47:34.610 --> 00:47:36.300
Duet, arias and so on.

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:38.030
I have a selected a couple

00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:40.810
to just show you how
incredibly identical they were.

00:47:40.810 --> 00:47:43.560
So they literally
transcribed a duet.

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:45.220
The aria for these bands.

00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:49.500
So Italians could enjoy either
the original or the band copy.

00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:51.510
This one is from-- .

00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:58.050
[ Foreign Language ]

00:47:58.050 --> 00:47:59.950
I'll be happy to say more
something about the plot,

00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:03.510
but just pay attention
to the melody.

one of the most famous

Here is another one.

00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:19.390
I put the subtitles here.

00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:20.690

[ Music ]

00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:03.810
Yeah, and this is really
a type of repertory

00:52:03.810 --> 00:52:06.550
that maybe has not
really investigated

00:52:06.550 --> 00:52:08.000
as much as we should.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:12.320
And yeah, definitely a good
step ahead in the future.

00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:14.680
&gt;&gt; Dr. John Haskell: Well,
Davide, thank you very much.

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:16.510
This was extraordinarily
interesting.

&gt;&gt; Dr. Davide Ceriani:
Thank you.

00:52:17.810 --> 00:52:19.690
&gt;&gt; Dr. John Haskell: We
appreciate your efforts.

00:52:19.690 --> 00:52:22.700
And finishing with the
beautiful music is perfect.

00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:24.510
Please join me in thanking him.

00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:30.260
[ Applause ]

00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:32.890
We have a reception back here.

00:52:32.890 --> 00:52:34.590
Wine, beer, et cetera.

00:52:34.590 --> 00:52:37.850
And, and some, some
other appetizers.

00:52:37.850 --> 00:52:40.420
You're not allowed to bring
them back into the collections.

00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:43.680
But please do check out the
collections in the back.

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:45.890
I want to alert you
to two things.

00:52:45.890 --> 00:52:49.210
Before I set your free and
the seatbelt sign comes off.

00:52:49.210 --> 00:52:51.390
And that is that we have
an event next Tues--

00:52:51.390 --> 00:52:55.840
an event next Thursday at 2:00
on The Bible in American life

00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:58.060
with Mark Knoll and
Lincoln Mullin

who are historians of the Bible.

00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:01.290
I think you'll find
it interesting.

00:53:01.290 --> 00:53:03.440
It's 2:00 right here
in this room.

00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:05.850
And then just to put on
your calendar going forward.

00:53:05.850 --> 00:53:12.060
We have July 19, the Restoring
the American Dream which is part

00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:15.930

Institute Lecture Series.

and E.J. Dionne of
the Washington Post.

00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:30.240
And the first event next
week is at 3:00, not 2:00.

00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:33.080
The Inouye lecture's at 6:30,
so that's an evening event.

00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:35.030
But again, thank you
for your attendance.

00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:37.080

opportunity, to,

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:41.510
