00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.920
This video covers key strategies
and knowledge that

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.950
will make working in R
much easier in the

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.810
near and long term.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.940
Let's start by opening R. If we
want, we can type directly

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.180
into the console.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.750
However, this makes it a bit
difficult to recreate our

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.870
work, so it's helpful to open a
new R document, also called

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.810
an R script.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.250
We can open a script by holding
down Command and

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.420
hitting N.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.620
Whenever you write R commands,
you should write

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:29.920
them in an R script.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.200
Then you can send the commands
in your script to an R

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.460
console to be run.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.990
For example, if your cursor is
unaligned in the R script, you

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.950
can run that line of code in
the console by holding down

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.200
Command and hitting Return.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.190
To run a larger block of code,
highlight the code, hold down

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.420
command and hit Return.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.630
It is useful to type your
commands into an R script

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.300
because you can organize your
commands, and you can run and

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.530
rerun these commands
quickly and easily.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.010
You can also save an R script
so you can use it later, and

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.310
this makes it easy to pick up
where you left off in your

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:05.890
next work session.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.220
Here, I'll save my script to
the desktop with the name

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.950
temp.R. Saving and loading files
in R can very helpful.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.510
R is always looking in a
particular folder on your

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.200
computer, and it is sometimes
important to know where it is

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.190
looking so you can access
and save files.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.980
There are two tools that
will make this easier--

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.740
getwd and setwd, which stand for
get working directory and

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.480
set working directory.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.240
The getwd function will tell
you which directory R is

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.830
currently working from.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.250
If you'd like to change the
directory you're working in,

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.100
use the setwd function and
specify a file path inside the

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.540
parentheses, where the path is
contained in quotation marks.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.970
For those working in the OS
X, there's one more tool--

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.820
Command D. Typing Command D will
open a window where you

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.115
can navigate to a folder
of your choosing.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.730
When you are done in an R
session, save your script and

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.160
then type q open parentheses
close

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.729
parentheses into the console.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.230
As long you carefully document
your work in an R script,

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.930
there's little reason to
save your work space.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.680
In the next video, we'll begin
creating objects in R.
