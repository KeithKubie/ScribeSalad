00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:01.149
Vsauce!

00:00:01.149 --> 00:00:02.149
Kevin here.

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:07.340
At Le Refuge des Fondues in Paris, France
- wine is served in a baby bottle.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.159
It's so cramped that you often have to walk
over the table just to get to your seat and

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:16.490
there are only two things on the menu - meat
of cheese.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:23.830
C1 cafe in New Zealand plans to serve you
burgers at 140 km per hour.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.320
Using a system of clear tubes, chefs will
be able to fill a stainless steel tube with

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.940
an order and send it rocketing where they'll
receive the food from the ceiling or up through

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:34.940
the basement.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.720
Opaque has several locations around the U.S.
and their food is served in pitch black darkness.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.730
Once inside you order before being seated
because you're then led to a table by holding

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.960
onto the shoulder of your server.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.390
For the full experience pick the "surprise
me menu" so not only do you have to find your

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.830
meal, you also have to figure out what it
is you're eating.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:02.170
The Twin Stars Diner in Moscow only hires
identical twins to serve to the customers

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.320
and they also dress identically while they
do it.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.550
The concept is based on the owner's favorite
childhood movie "Kingdom of Crooked Mirrors"

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.510
where a girl looks into an alternate universe
and sees her twin.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.610
For a fully automated meal, 's Baggers in
Germany will give your food a ride on a roller

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.610
coaster.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.500
Sit down and choose your order from the screen
located at each table - send it to the kitchen

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.210
and then wait for it to come down the food
roller coaster.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.909
"Black poop" and "Smells like poop" are just
a couple of the dining options available at

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.510
LA's Magic Restroom Restaurant.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:44.140
Customers sit on toilets while they eat their
dinner out of toilet and urinal shaped dinnerware

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.750
with bathroom tiles and shower heads for decoration
on the wall.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.330
Can't talk about bathroom-themed dining without
mentioning Modern Toilet a restaurant chain

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.580
based in Taiwan where diners also sit on non-working
toilets and eat and drink out of tiny toilet

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.580
bowls.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.909
Themed restaurants are popular in Asia, and
the Alacatraz ER restaurant in Japan is purposefully

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.119
one of the creepiest.

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.510
The medical prison theme starts off with servers
dressed in nurses outfits that handcuff you

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.359
and lock you in a cell for dinner where food
and drinks are served from syringes, mannequin

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:22.110
heads, and test tubes.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.599
Located in Finland the Snow Village uses 1,000
truckloads of snow are used to create the

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.049
winter wonderland.&nbsp;

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:33.169
The Ice Bar is one of the two restaurants
and the interior is made completely out of

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:39.549
ice and snow and food and drinks are even
served from ice sculpted bowls and glasses.

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:46.819
The temperature is between -2 and -5 celsius
at all times, so you have to eat in full winter

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:47.819
attire.

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.110
The Hajime Robot restaurant in Bangkok uses
robots to serve you food and clean up after

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.110
you.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.800
"Hajime" means first time or beginning in
Japanese and so they named it that because

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.480
it was the first Japanese restaurant to have
robots serving food....but if serving isn't

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:09.120
enough they also do a little dance.&nbsp;

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.210
So turn out the lights, put on your winter
clothes and sit on the toilet because your

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:21.180
next meal might be served by identical twin
robots at 140 km/h - and as always - thanks

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.040
for watching.
