00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.876
Here are the factored pairs for negative 45 and we want to find one that sums to

00:00:04.876 --> 00:00:09.579
four. Well, negative 5 and 9 multiply to negative 45 and add to 4, so these are

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:14.310
my answers for the first number puzzle. For the second number puzzle, I want to

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:19.052
find 2 numbers that multiply to negative 45 and add to negative 12. That must be

00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:23.615
3 and negative 15. For the third number puzzle, I want to find factors of 45

00:00:23.615 --> 00:00:28.652
that sum to negative 14. Well, here are the positive factor pairs for positive

00:00:28.652 --> 00:00:32.891
45, but none of these pairs add to negative 14. This must mean I need the

00:00:32.891 --> 00:00:37.576
negative factor pairs of positive 45. We know a negative times a negative is a

00:00:37.576 --> 00:00:42.383
positive. So now, I'm just looking for the factor pair that adds to negative 14.

00:00:42.383 --> 00:00:47.996
This would be negative 5 and negative 9. This must mean the last factor pair is

00:00:47.996 --> 00:00:53.568
negative 1 and negative 45. They sum to negative 46 and they multiply to

00:00:53.568 --> 00:00:54.608
positive 45.
