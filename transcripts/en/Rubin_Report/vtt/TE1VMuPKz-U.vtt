1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.160
[inaudible].

2
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.671
<v 1>All right,</v>

3
00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:08.120
so let's shift the discussion a little bit to the NRA because that was the other

4
00:00:08.121 --> 00:00:08.931
part of this,

5
00:00:08.931 --> 00:00:13.931
that during the town hall and the subsequent discussions that it got very

6
00:00:15.021 --> 00:00:19.160
confused as to what the NRA actually does.
What do they want to do?

7
00:00:19.161 --> 00:00:23.270
What are their people who don't like them,
think they do,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

8
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.700
Um,
so first off,
just give me your position on the NRA general.

9
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.620
<v 2>I think the NRA is a fantastic organization that defends the rights,</v>

10
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.790
the right to bear arms of individuals thing with the NRA is that they really

11
00:00:35.791 --> 00:00:38.940
don't have the money influence that people say they do.

12
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.860
All they have is the social influence.

13
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.310
Republican senators know that the base believes in the values of the NRA

14
00:00:46.741 --> 00:00:49.710
promotes and defense and they understand that.
And if they go against the NRA,

15
00:00:49.711 --> 00:00:53.670
they're going against their own constituents.
The NRA does not have a big budget.

16
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.750
They really don't.
They,
they're not like this,
like super powerful like that.

17
00:00:57.751 --> 00:01:01.440
They directly control senators and congressman with their money.

18
00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:05.070
They control it with their ideals.
What the NRA does,
which is fantastic,

19
00:01:05.071 --> 00:01:08.970
is it provides a check from like from the public,

20
00:01:08.971 --> 00:01:12.540
not not from the government for defending our right to bear arms.

21
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.270
And it's fantastic.
And you know,

22
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.470
it helped I think with the case with Mcdonald's versus Chicago that helped

23
00:01:19.471 --> 00:01:23.070
bolster a second amendment rights for individuals.

24
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.270
I mean in the NRA does just does a great job.
They're NRA Ila program,

25
00:01:27.271 --> 00:01:30.420
which is actually the legislative branch on defending the second amendment does

26
00:01:30.421 --> 00:01:31.590
a fantastic job.

27
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.070
I think right now they're taking a case against raising the age from 18 to 21

28
00:01:35.071 --> 00:01:36.720
there was right for the shooting.
Uh,

29
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.730
Rick Scott signed into law in Florida raising the age to buy I think a firearm

30
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.600
rifle now.
So before,
before,
uh,

31
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.870
you couldn't buy a handgun if you're under 21,

32
00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:51.720
but you could buy a rifle because handguns were used in violent crimes.

33
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.880
Whether I think that's right or not,
that's a separate discussion.

34
00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:58.080
But he raised the age from 1821 to buy a rifle and directly the NRA was like,

35
00:01:58.081 --> 00:02:00.510
this is unconstitutional.
Boom.

36
00:02:00.511 --> 00:02:04.800
We put it in a lawsuit just to address that 18 to 21 age.
Uh,

37
00:02:04.801 --> 00:02:08.310
there is absolutely no evidence that raising the age does absolutely does,

38
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.790
does anything to,
uh,
to lower,
um,
gun homicide whatsoever.

39
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.290
<v 1>So what do you think about the certain set of people that think that if we could</v>

40
00:02:14.291 --> 00:02:18.910
just have all of the right laws or if we could just manage everything properly,

41
00:02:18.911 --> 00:02:22.760
that everything would be fine because it doesn't take into,
do we have

42
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.740
<v 2>the laws that we need already on the books as thing as the enforcement doesn't</v>

43
00:02:26.741 --> 00:02:29.290
work?
So I'll just make a tangent.
I'll get back to here.

44
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.860
I think it is utterly hypocritical that the left hates Trump and they,

45
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.910
that he's in power,
but then they're saying we have to trust the government more.

46
00:02:36.911 --> 00:02:39.610
So if you think the government,
if you think Trump has literally Hitler,

47
00:02:39.611 --> 00:02:43.030
why are you giving away your right to wear berms to this tyrannical government?

48
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.460
Um,
what was the question again?

49
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.610
<v 1>Well,
just that there's a certain set of people that think if we just have,</v>

50
00:02:48.611 --> 00:02:49.630
oh yeah,
I got

51
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.520
<v 2>you.
So we already have the laws on the books,
you know,</v>

52
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.970
just the enforcement is the enforcement of what needs to occur.

53
00:02:57.971 --> 00:02:59.510
Like the Lautenberg amendment,
that domain,

54
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.270
it says that domestic abusers can not have a firearm that's already on the
books.

55
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:08.200
It just needs to be enforced.
There's the issue with um,
you know,

56
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.610
the nics background check program where they say we need more time to,

57
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.210
to evaluate and give you back your background check in order to buy a weapon.

58
00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:18.010
The issue is the government doesn't need more time,

59
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.660
it just needs more of the records.

60
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.990
So the reason why the Texas soil and shooting occurred was because I think it

61
00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:26.000
was some military brands where there were someone who were,
he,

62
00:03:26.001 --> 00:03:29.070
he committed a violation.
And by law they sh the heat.

63
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.030
They should have transferred that over to the database.

64
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.650
And if we wouldn't have been able to buy a weapon,

65
00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:34.080
but the records weren't transferred,

66
00:03:34.081 --> 00:03:36.430
who was able to buy a weapon and he shot up the church.

67
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.420
So the government just needs to get all the records and do their job.

68
00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:44.620
Same thing with red flag laws.
Um,
and people like to talk about this,

69
00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:48.460
this is a little bit more the trickier areas of this,
but red flag laws,
uh,

70
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.490
basically say that someone can flag you and then you get reviewed and then you

71
00:03:53.561 --> 00:03:56.680
can get your gun taken away.
Uh,
and a lot of people also like,

72
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.890
so the issue with red flag gun laws is that it's all about government

73
00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:03.610
enforcement and,
and that's,
that's,
that's the issue.

74
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.570
And there's also the big issue where people like to talk about mental health and

75
00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:10.870
they say you mentally ill people shouldn't be able to acquire a weapon.

76
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.470
So I have talked to countless individuals about this and I should ask Peterson,

77
00:04:14.471 --> 00:04:15.304
but I forgot to,

78
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.270
the question is how do you determine when someone is mentally ill enough and

79
00:04:19.271 --> 00:04:22.480
hits the threshold so they cannot have a weapon and nobody knows.

80
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.310
And in addition to things with the shooter and my school looking retroactively,

81
00:04:27.311 --> 00:04:29.080
we can say this kid was mentally insane,

82
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.210
but I don't know if a court would adjudicate that.

83
00:04:31.211 --> 00:04:33.720
He would actually be mentally insane by,

84
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.860
by law and therefore taking his gun away.

85
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.780
<v 1>Yeah.
So is the inherent problem here.</v>

86
00:04:37.781 --> 00:04:41.230
Do you think that you cannot manage all of these things?

87
00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:45.220
You can do the best you can to have some sensible laws around them and defend

88
00:04:45.221 --> 00:04:49.150
our right to bear arms and all of that and make sure schools are taken care of.

89
00:04:49.151 --> 00:04:53.260
But that generally speaking,
yes,
there's a sort of sliding scale psychologically,

90
00:04:53.261 --> 00:04:56.860
but also that the people that want to do bad,

91
00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.720
we'll find ways to do bad.

92
00:04:58.721 --> 00:05:01.570
They're not the ones that are walking out and looking at a building and it says,

93
00:05:01.571 --> 00:05:04.150
oh no guns here.
Yes,
I'm not going to walk in with a gun.

94
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.430
<v 2>Criminals will act like criminals no matter what.</v>

95
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.280
But the good thing is is that our laws are working.

96
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.600
I mean I think it's violent crime or hot.

97
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.650
Some rate from the 1990s to 2010 has decreased by 50% and and pub in schools are

98
00:05:22.351 --> 00:05:25.200
safer now than they were 20 years ago.

99
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.090
Like school shooting rates are declining and homicide rate gun homicide rates

100
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.250
are declining and the homicide rates are declining.

101
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.340
So we are becoming a more peaceful nation.

102
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.750
And a lot of that has to do with having more gun owners and to having more,

103
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.000
you know,
concealed carry permit owners.
Because those people,
when,

104
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.060
when there's a shooting,
those people are the first responders.

105
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.370
I think it's wrong to say that,
oh,

106
00:05:50.371 --> 00:05:53.520
we'll just let the police arrive after the crime has been committed.
No,

107
00:05:53.521 --> 00:05:55.950
you need people there immediately to stop the shooter.

108
00:05:55.951 --> 00:05:59.900
That's why I'm all for teachers and arm school officers at schools to

109
00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:01.550
immediately take down the shooter.

110
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.520
<v 1>All right,
so let's,
let's shift,
I mean,</v>

111
00:06:03.521 --> 00:06:05.050
I don't think we're going to fully get away from guns here,

112
00:06:05.051 --> 00:06:06.550
but let's shift a little bit.
Okay.

113
00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.580
What is it like to be a 17 year old right now that's in the mix of this,

114
00:06:12.491 --> 00:06:17.080
that's now a public person.
It's crazy to just be part of this,

115
00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.560
this oddly unique time where it feels like the adults have lost the plot and

116
00:06:23.441 --> 00:06:27.190
it's gotta be very hard for you to find people that kind of make sense.

117
00:06:27.191 --> 00:06:29.050
I think you've been able to find a couple of them,

118
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.700
but just to be 17 in this very odd political cultural time.

119
00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.300
<v 2>Yeah,
it's insane.
It's insane.</v>

120
00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.340
<v 1>What does it feel unique to you?
I know you haven't lived through this before,</v>

121
00:06:41.341 --> 00:06:42.174
but like

122
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.660
<v 2>I don't know how to judge it.
All I know is that</v>

123
00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.040
I'm an adult now and I have to act like an adult,

124
00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.730
whether whether I'm 17 or 18 I have committed like commitments that I make,

125
00:06:53.731 --> 00:06:56.040
I have to go through with them and I've just,
my maturity,

126
00:06:56.041 --> 00:06:57.450
I be forced to become mature.

127
00:06:57.451 --> 00:07:00.000
Like I can no longer play video games and waste time.

128
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:05.270
There's things that I have to do but I've just been so blessed to find a solid

129
00:07:05.431 --> 00:07:08.220
group of people who actually care about me and want the best for me.

130
00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.640
Like like Ben and Charlie and Guy Benson,

131
00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:15.210
people who have just reached out to me and I'm just selflessly helped me

132
00:07:15.211 --> 00:07:16.860
navigate this political minefield.

133
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:21.990
But it's crazy cause like all the people that I looked up to like two years ago

134
00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:24.580
and like would watch their videos,
I'm not going to snack.

135
00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.300
Trying to like boost your ego here,
but I used to,
I would watch your show,

136
00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.930
please consider it.
But yeah,

137
00:07:30.931 --> 00:07:34.170
it's awesome that now I can reach out for their expertise.

138
00:07:34.171 --> 00:07:36.840
The thing with me is that I always like to start with,
look,

139
00:07:36.841 --> 00:07:38.540
I don't know anything and I,

140
00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:40.890
I'm always looking to get more information to know more.

141
00:07:40.891 --> 00:07:45.270
Like today I had a call with a gun expert,
um,

142
00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:46.920
on the way here and it's like,

143
00:07:46.921 --> 00:07:51.900
what more can I learn in order to be like fully fluent and knowledgeable about

144
00:07:51.901 --> 00:07:53.160
the subject that I'm talking about?

145
00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:56.430
And there are a bunch of stuff that I don't know about and I'm constantly trying

146
00:07:56.431 --> 00:07:56.970
to learn.

147
00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.830
<v 1>So when you see a guy,
and again,</v>

148
00:07:58.831 --> 00:08:01.200
I don't like making this about people rather than ideas,

149
00:08:01.201 --> 00:08:05.790
but when you see a guy like David Hogg out there and he clearly is taking just

150
00:08:05.791 --> 00:08:10.710
the progressive line on this and he seems more to me to be sort of a progressive

151
00:08:10.711 --> 00:08:12.780
activists than sort of a,

152
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:16.950
a fair arbiter of what's going on here.
Um,

153
00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:22.500
that's gotta be frustrating for you that he's so public about this,
I suppose.

154
00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:23.850
Well,

155
00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:28.850
you obviously probably disagree with him on 100% of the policy parts.

156
00:08:29.041 --> 00:08:31.380
This is true.
Yeah.
I don't want to make it about the personal part,

157
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:35.760
but that he's thought of as sort of a media hero and you're kind of the black

158
00:08:35.761 --> 00:08:40.520
sheep of this group.
I mean maybe not to the,
to the Shapiros and me and whoever.

159
00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:45.660
<v 2>Yeah.
So here's what I say,
there was no issue that kids are on television.</v>

160
00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:49.540
The issue is,
is that when someone is spouting policy,
they are,

161
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:51.090
they are no longer a child.

162
00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.910
They are pushing policy and they should be treated as every adult is such,

163
00:08:53.911 --> 00:08:56.850
when you say something outrageous,
you should be called out on that.

164
00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.370
I remember there's a segment with it.

165
00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:02.350
It was on CNN where he said something completely outlandish.
Uh,

166
00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:04.570
and there was no blowback solo careers.

167
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:09.170
<v 1>Was that the line about Marco Rubio wants to kill kids?
That something crazy.</v>

168
00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:13.280
<v 2>So what I say is when I'm pushing policy and I said I to do please like tell me</v>

169
00:09:13.281 --> 00:09:15.740
that I'm saying something stupid and pushed me back on that.

170
00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:18.860
The thing is with me that I look,
when I'm on TV,

171
00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.560
I'm not talking as a child and pushing policy.
Right.

172
00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.950
And I expect there to be pushed back.
I don't think you can say whatever,

173
00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:25.671
whatever you want.

174
00:09:25.671 --> 00:09:30.530
Like I and in addition I think that having debate is great.

175
00:09:30.531 --> 00:09:33.980
So like I love,
I love going on piers Morgan and having a debate with him.

176
00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:38.090
That was great.
And I think we have to,
I hate this thing,

177
00:09:38.091 --> 00:09:39.510
we're like we're,

178
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.600
we're one second you're spouting policy but then you rushed back to the shield

179
00:09:44.841 --> 00:09:45.051
of,
Oh,

180
00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:48.340
I'm a child but we have to take my opinion seriously because the second I say

181
00:09:48.341 --> 00:09:52.790
that I'm an adult.
So just,
just this isn't,
this isn't fair.
And what I saw,

182
00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.900
I think one of the reasons why,
um,

183
00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:01.120
I grew to such publicity was because I was saying the things that adults weren't

184
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:01.791
able to say.

185
00:10:01.791 --> 00:10:06.410
Like I was able to see things that Ben Shapiro or you or Charlie Kirk or the

186
00:10:06.411 --> 00:10:10.640
right wasn't able to say because I'm a kid and I don't think that's fair because

187
00:10:10.641 --> 00:10:13.340
I think that when you're sprouting policy,
you are no longer a child.

188
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:14.240
You are an adult.

189
00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:19.050
<v 1>What do you make of what's going on with the right generally because you ran the</v>

190
00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:20.100
turning point.

191
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.770
Was that the high school event that I did or I've done so many bicycling.
You,

192
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:27.660
okay,
so you did the high school leadership summit in DC and I spoke there,

193
00:10:27.661 --> 00:10:28.500
this is a couple of months ago,

194
00:10:28.501 --> 00:10:32.070
and you had a great lineup of speakers and Peter Teal was there and you had big,

195
00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.410
big time politicians and,
and first of all,

196
00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:38.070
I mean that was the first time we met and I was like,
holy debate about abortion,

197
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:42.300
that abortion is accurate.
So that's my point.
So first of all,
you,

198
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:45.660
you ran this whole thing.
I mean you're,
you're,
you're still in high school,
right?

199
00:10:45.661 --> 00:10:47.430
We're going to talk a little bit about where you want to go to college and all

200
00:10:47.431 --> 00:10:47.521
that,

201
00:10:47.521 --> 00:10:52.521
but you ran an incredible event with major prime time people and and it was,

202
00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:57.060
it was jam packed and it was diverse in terms of ideas.

203
00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.430
So we get into a private debate about abortion,

204
00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:03.660
but you brought me there and I went up there.
Thanks.

205
00:11:03.661 --> 00:11:06.780
But I went up there and I talked about my differences with this group.

206
00:11:06.781 --> 00:11:11.010
I talked about the kids were respectful and I talked about gay marriage and

207
00:11:11.011 --> 00:11:14.730
abortion and death penalty in a couple of other things that generally these

208
00:11:14.731 --> 00:11:18.430
young conservatives are not for.
I think gay marriage there pretty much for,

209
00:11:18.431 --> 00:11:21.090
I like that the ship has sailed on that one actually.

210
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.090
I'm pretty sure I've got a huge ovation on that.
Um,

211
00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:28.170
but it is just clear to me that there has been a real alignment on the right

212
00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:32.320
where there is exactly what you're talking about or special about it.

213
00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.000
<v 2>Yeah.
Can we just say that Lindsey Graham 2.0 is fantastic.</v>

214
00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.570
<v 1>No,
the guy,
it's unbelievable that,
I mean just that one,</v>

215
00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:40.860
the thing with the tie the any day,
right?
Yeah,
yeah.
Then he's doing great

216
00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.080
daily caller.
Right?
So I

217
00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:48.180
<v 2>think the rightest finally realizing that youth,
um,</v>

218
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:52.180
and like energizing the youth and instilling the next like future of

219
00:11:52.181 --> 00:11:53.950
conservative leaders is important.

220
00:11:53.951 --> 00:11:55.730
And we saw that with the high schoolers from something.

221
00:11:56.110 --> 00:12:00.610
We had some of the biggest names speak like Nikki Haley.
Hey Betsy device.

222
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:05.230
We'd like,
oh,
attorney Jeff sessions.
We had so many people.
Um,

223
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:08.200
and every week we had Mark Meadows,
we had Steve Scully's,
we had,
we had,

224
00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:12.190
we had Prager,
we need you.
Um,
and it was just,

225
00:12:12.191 --> 00:12:15.040
it was fantastic to see the right.

226
00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:19.600
Just understand that these are the leaders of tomorrow,
let's inform them.

227
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:23.800
But in addition,
turning,
put his such a great organization,
it's free speech,

228
00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:28.240
free markets and capitalism.
Those are the three legs.
Uh,

229
00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.000
and what we saw with turning point is such a,

230
00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:33.010
it's such a great organization because we were,

231
00:12:33.011 --> 00:12:36.760
we brought people who I have disagreements with to speak there.

232
00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:40.060
Mark Cuban spoke,
got us a couple standing ovations,

233
00:12:40.061 --> 00:12:42.340
had a debate with Charlie and people loved it.

234
00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:47.550
So we're all open having free discussion and debate like we're,
we're,

235
00:12:47.551 --> 00:12:50.500
we're working on Sassal shooting action summit December,

236
00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.250
1920 second shameless plug.
And we're,

237
00:12:53.251 --> 00:12:57.460
we're looking like how can we get the most diverse group of people to speak?

238
00:12:57.461 --> 00:13:00.490
Like I'm thinking about somebody from the intellectual dark web to speak there.

239
00:13:00.491 --> 00:13:04.930
I think it's great if we can get Alan Dershowitz just how can we get diversity

240
00:13:04.931 --> 00:13:05.400
of thought?

241
00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:08.850
<v 1>So why is it that these new right or whatever you want to call it,</v>

242
00:13:08.851 --> 00:13:09.930
young conservative

243
00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:11.570
<v 2>group,</v>

244
00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:15.020
<v 1>whatever it is,
why is it that you guys are able to do this?</v>

245
00:13:15.021 --> 00:13:17.090
And I see virtually none of this

246
00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.940
<v 2>on your counterparts on the left.
That's not sure.</v>

247
00:13:20.941 --> 00:13:23.960
I mean the left has organized and mobilize youth dish right now.
We are,

248
00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.290
<v 1>well,
I mean,
no,
no,
no,
but I'm talking about diversity of thought.</v>

249
00:13:26.291 --> 00:13:30.020
Like where are they bickering in people that's even mildly disagree with it.

250
00:13:30.021 --> 00:13:31.690
I'm not talking about scary conservatives.

251
00:13:31.691 --> 00:13:35.020
I'm talking about old school liberals where,
where are they inviting them to?

252
00:13:35.021 --> 00:13:36.520
Just have an interesting conversation,

253
00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:41.440
<v 2>just so dead set on political correctness and sang everything to not offend</v>

254
00:13:41.441 --> 00:13:45.490
anyone with the slightest micro micro micro aggression that is just,

255
00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:50.640
you can't live in that world and tall like logical liberals like yourself are

256
00:13:51.941 --> 00:13:52.930
moving to the right.

257
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:57.260
<v 1>I like these,
uh,
these subtle little injections of pleasantry.
Yeah,
that's nice.</v>

258
00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:01.420
Are moving people to the right and conservatives are like,
come here.
My refugees,

259
00:14:01.421 --> 00:14:04.270
my political refugees were embracing you.
Yeah.
So,
okay.

260
00:14:04.271 --> 00:14:07.630
So when I hear people will say,
Ruben,
the conservatives are just using you.

261
00:14:07.631 --> 00:14:09.850
You go to turning point,
they're just using you.

262
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.690
<v 2>You're not just using me,
Kyle.
No,
I mean,
yeah,
but no,</v>

263
00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.310
<v 1>no,
but really,
I mean what I've seen is intellectual flexibility there and it's,</v>

264
00:14:19.311 --> 00:14:23.630
even when I've had been in here and we've done this conversation repeatedly now

265
00:14:23.631 --> 00:14:28.330
about gay marriage,
I just firmly believe that as time goes on,
I can shift him.

266
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:30.770
There's something that's sort of insulting about it to me.

267
00:14:30.771 --> 00:14:32.780
When people say that to me because I'm confident,

268
00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:35.150
I'm confident enough in my thoughts,

269
00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:36.361
<v 2>take you on abortion.</v>

270
00:14:36.361 --> 00:14:39.240
I really think that like in a few years you'll be with us on the board.

271
00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:42.880
<v 1>Maybe.
But you know what,
that would be a trade off,
right?
Like if,
if,
if,</v>

272
00:14:42.881 --> 00:14:47.010
ultimately I always described myself as begrudgingly nation

273
00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:49.940
<v 2>of,
of homosexuality.
While I don't,
I don't,</v>

274
00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:52.910
I don't have a opinion on it because I haven't thought about it enough.

275
00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:57.350
By his religious standpoint.
It makes sense.
But from the government standpoint,

276
00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:58.580
it also makes total sense.

277
00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:00.460
<v 1>Well,
that's why I'm completely fine with him.</v>

278
00:15:00.461 --> 00:15:03.670
It's like you want to have your religious view.
I have to respect that.

279
00:15:03.671 --> 00:15:05.650
But if you are trying to legislate my life,

280
00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.690
the great thing with the right is that we're okay,

281
00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.280
<v 2>but you're just diversity of thought.
Just say whatever you want.</v>

282
00:15:11.281 --> 00:15:15.130
Let's talk about it.
And let's get to the right rational viewpoint.
Like I've,

283
00:15:15.131 --> 00:15:18.510
I've always been about the bait because it brings people,

284
00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:23.280
it's all about logic and it brings people to the right end result.

285
00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.800
<v 1>So when I'm on tour with Peterson,
uh,</v>

286
00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:31.390
the question that I think both of us get asked more than anything else is what

287
00:15:31.391 --> 00:15:36.391
are the best techniques to wake people up out of this sort of postmodern

288
00:15:36.581 --> 00:15:38.800
identity politics,
progressive group.

289
00:15:38.801 --> 00:15:41.470
Think as a young person in the midst of this,

290
00:15:41.471 --> 00:15:44.110
what would you say are some techniques you've been able to use?

291
00:15:44.111 --> 00:15:46.410
Because it can't just be about drubbing them with facts,
right?

292
00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.540
<v 2>I mean the left is doing a fantastic job where they're just craziness and</v>

293
00:15:49.541 --> 00:15:50.680
pushing people to the right.

294
00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:53.240
So there's just sort of stands for doing that on themself.

295
00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:56.890
What we saw right now with Kanye and in addition,
it's just,

296
00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:59.800
he was simply saying freedom of expression,
freedom of thought.

297
00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:02.900
I support the president.
Our president has to be the freshest,
the flyers stuff,

298
00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:04.563
the greatest lie.

299
00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:08.740
I'm just pushing people to diversity of thought and freedom of expression to

300
00:16:08.741 --> 00:16:10.030
think whatever you want and you shouldn't have,

301
00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:15.060
you shouldn't be held down by your skin color or your race or your sexuality.

302
00:16:16.271 --> 00:16:17.530
Like none of this matters.

303
00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:22.330
You should be able to think what you want and be able to say it without being

304
00:16:22.331 --> 00:16:24.430
tied down by you know,
your identity.

305
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:27.260
<v 1>Yeah.
How do you make sure that you don't get burned out?</v>

306
00:16:27.261 --> 00:16:30.470
Because I think I remember the first communication we ever had.

307
00:16:30.471 --> 00:16:32.750
I think when either you followed me or I followed you on Twitter.

308
00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:35.360
I just sent you a quick one line note and I was just like,

309
00:16:35.361 --> 00:16:37.850
just don't get burned out because I saw you just,

310
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:41.210
you were in the fight every day.
You were,
you were owning,

311
00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:42.980
owning the libs and all that.
Which by the way,

312
00:16:42.981 --> 00:16:46.640
you know you mentioned that Nikki Haley was at your summit.
It's like she went,

313
00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:49.440
she went to to,
you know,
in effect what is a,

314
00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:52.940
a lot of Trump people right at this,
at this event you put on,

315
00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:55.190
she goes there and she says,
you know,

316
00:16:55.191 --> 00:16:59.000
don't make this about just owning the libs and she got applause for it.

317
00:16:59.001 --> 00:17:03.590
And I hit that same point I think the next day because I think if you guys do

318
00:17:03.591 --> 00:17:07.720
exactly what you just laid out,
just kind of stand there and be cool and BBC,

319
00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:09.860
you'll,
you will welcome a lot of people.

320
00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:12.110
<v 2>I think.
I honestly believe that the Cincy wins.</v>

321
00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:15.090
Can we just take a second and say,
Nikki Haley is fantastic and I,
I,

322
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.940
I kind of cried for like a week.

323
00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.010
<v 1>Right?
Ever since she said that.
Well,</v>

324
00:17:19.011 --> 00:17:23.180
do you think that this is perhaps a paving the road for her running at some

325
00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:23.410
point?

326
00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:28.240
<v 2>I don't know.
There were so many 40 chess like theories.
I just know,
I just,</v>

327
00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:32.770
I know that she's just been doing a fantastic job and she's just one of the
best.

328
00:17:32.771 --> 00:17:34.930
I Know Nikki Haley,
Ben Shapiro,
2024

329
00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:39.030
<v 1>yeah,
I mean I'd probably have to be press secretary at that point.
Yeah,</v>

330
00:17:39.031 --> 00:17:42.450
that would work for like one horrific week and then I know that'd be fine.

331
00:17:42.451 --> 00:17:44.070
I should do.
No,
but all right,

332
00:17:44.071 --> 00:17:47.520
so gimme gimme some of the techniques when you see that it can't just be about

333
00:17:47.521 --> 00:17:50.010
standing still and,
and facts,
if you're,
if you're

334
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:54.540
<v 2>in a conversation with a young person that's really just bought into all of
this,</v>

335
00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:58.050
what are some of the techniques you use towards,
have you been successful?

336
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.270
I suspect that,
yeah,
I think I have,

337
00:18:00.271 --> 00:18:04.020
but the first thing you have to realize is that is this person looking,

338
00:18:04.021 --> 00:18:07.800
tapping open discussion and actually wants,
sorry about that.

339
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:10.180
Talking a lot these days.
It's all right or,

340
00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:14.850
or actually wants to develop their point of view.
If they do,

341
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.900
you have to treat it with decency and respect and not calling them an idiot or

342
00:18:18.901 --> 00:18:23.760
something.
Can you have to treat them like a,
like a good human being should,
um,

343
00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.850
and then just have a rational conversation with them and see where they're

344
00:18:26.851 --> 00:18:28.180
coming from.
Uh,

345
00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:32.130
and a lot of times I can immediately know what they're going to respond to me.

346
00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.450
Like just straight up the VAT.

347
00:18:33.451 --> 00:18:36.240
I know what they're gonna respond to me and I hit them with,
with an initial,

348
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:39.000
here's what you're gonna say,
here's the reason.
And they're just shocked.

349
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:42.960
But then do you get them around?
I mean,
do you find,
cause it really,

350
00:18:42.961 --> 00:18:46.860
it's like sort of deprogramming somebody out of this and I've had some success

351
00:18:46.861 --> 00:18:50.220
at it.
Right.
And then a lot of them have watched my show now.
So yeah.

352
00:18:50.221 --> 00:18:51.540
I mean when I first heard speaking out,

353
00:18:51.541 --> 00:18:54.450
kids would come up to me in school in two things.
They would say,
it'd be like,

354
00:18:54.451 --> 00:18:57.600
Kyle,
I'm a conservative.
So,
so the thing about school is really interesting.

355
00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:59.880
I would get stare downs and like people like,

356
00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:03.090
like try to beat me up so people would like send me like,
hey Kyle,
watch out.

357
00:19:03.091 --> 00:19:07.270
So and so I was trying to beat you up.
I was like,
all right man,
go for it.
Um,

358
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:11.160
and people would give me stare downs and it was such and villainization of being

359
00:19:11.161 --> 00:19:13.200
conservative and being second amendment somewhere.
When I spoke up,

360
00:19:13.201 --> 00:19:16.710
I kind of opened the crack for people to say,
Oh,
I agree with him.

361
00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:18.900
People would walk up to me and like hush up.
Like,
Kyle,

362
00:19:18.901 --> 00:19:23.580
thank you so much for doing.
I'm just scared to speak out.
In addition,
people say,

363
00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:24.361
Kyle,

364
00:19:24.361 --> 00:19:27.960
I thought I was programmed control and you spoke and I listened to you and then

365
00:19:27.961 --> 00:19:31.520
I did some more research and I agree with you.
So that was great to see.

366
00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:33.420
And like that's just,
that's all I'm here for.

367
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:37.260
So like to have people you know,

368
00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:39.900
understand conservatism and understand the second amendment,

369
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:43.560
it's gotta be pretty weird that you guys are still in high school,
right?

370
00:19:43.561 --> 00:19:48.210
Like now you're your celebrities in the most strange sense of celebrity you are

371
00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:52.800
and you're all still in high school together.
What is that like?
I mean,

372
00:19:52.801 --> 00:19:57.570
at the end of the day we have to remember that we're kids and I will explain it

373
00:19:57.571 --> 00:20:00.120
to her.
So you guys don't think I'm hypocritical.
Um,

374
00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:04.140
when you're on TV and you're spouting politics,
you're an adult,

375
00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:08.640
but in your private life you're a kid and we cannot forget that.
So let's say,

376
00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:13.230
you know,
when someone,
some kid on the left does something stupid.

377
00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:18.210
It's at the end of the day,
they're a kid and we have to address it at such.
Um,

378
00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.153
but,
but it's,

379
00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:24.240
it's been a crazy whirlwind and I think thank God I found a solid group of

380
00:20:24.241 --> 00:20:26.790
people who want the best for me that I can reach out,
you know,

381
00:20:26.791 --> 00:20:30.570
just not for policy but also like personal advice.
Like I,
I,
uh,

382
00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.060
I asked Ben,
Hey,

383
00:20:33.061 --> 00:20:35.820
how do you think I should approach college app since I'm a conservative,

384
00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.670
you know,
and he helped me out and it's just,

385
00:20:38.671 --> 00:20:43.560
it's so great to be able to reach out to people and have them,
you know,

386
00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:48.460
give you advice from like look 20 years older than me and giving me that advice

387
00:20:48.461 --> 00:20:49.540
that they had to go through.

388
00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:53.520
<v 1>Yeah.
What was that great tweet?
So you're like number one in your class,
right?</v>

389
00:20:53.521 --> 00:20:55.860
Not like number one,
you are number one.
Is that correct?

390
00:20:55.861 --> 00:20:59.670
There was some tweet that you had about that.
Awesome.
What was that

391
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:02.800
<v 2>number one?
Yeah.
Um,</v>

392
00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:07.180
and people got so angry cause so angry and they're like,

393
00:21:07.181 --> 00:21:11.860
we're going to boycott graduation.
So I was like,
Yay.
More cake.
It was great.

394
00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:15.920
And it was great.
And then,
you know,
the s the next semester,

395
00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.940
what was the reason they wanted to boycott Greg?
I was number one.
Right,
right,

396
00:21:18.941 --> 00:21:19.290
right,
right.

397
00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:22.960
So then the semester updated and then I was still number one because I posted

398
00:21:22.961 --> 00:21:25.390
another tweet about that and then also blew up and I was like,

399
00:21:25.391 --> 00:21:27.730
we're going to get Ben Shapiro to calm.
Dana Lash is going to come.

400
00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:31.420
It's going to be fantastic.
Chris Cox was like,
yeah,
I'm going to be there.

401
00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:33.330
<v 1>Well,
why would they want,</v>

402
00:21:33.331 --> 00:21:37.370
I mean is that really how sort of polarizing Lee crazy this has got yes.

403
00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.690
At a high school level that just because they don't like,

404
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:43.950
I mean you're your number one not by,
by being ordained no.
Onto you.

405
00:21:43.951 --> 00:21:47.100
You're number one out of clearly a lot of hard work and smarts and all that.

406
00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:49.440
You'd think that there would be certain respect for that

407
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:55.050
<v 2>in some alternate universe.
But it's sad that we have,</v>

408
00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.600
we are no longer able to be friends with people.

409
00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.000
Like it's sad that people on the left think so.

410
00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:04.800
People on the left think that you're a Republican,
therefore you're evil.

411
00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.860
And that sad that you're not allowed to be friends with people who have

412
00:22:07.861 --> 00:22:10.740
different political viewpoints and you're like,
my best friend is a liberal.

413
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:13.620
And I actually brought him to the turning point event and after he was like,

414
00:22:13.621 --> 00:22:16.620
you know,
Kyle,
some off some people made some good points and I was like,
yeah,

415
00:22:16.621 --> 00:22:20.910
I told you,
he's still liberal.
He's an old school.
That's cool.

416
00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:24.260
He's probably forgetting there.
You and him both.

417
00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:29.940
<v 1>Um,
all right.
So wait,
let's talk a little bit about college.
Okay.
So you're,</v>

418
00:22:29.941 --> 00:22:34.020
you're doing a great job in high school,
clearly.
Now you've got a public profile.

419
00:22:34.021 --> 00:22:34.831
Grades are great.

420
00:22:34.831 --> 00:22:39.390
Seemingly you could get in to wherever you want to go and try and do it.
Yeah.

421
00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:39.631
Yeah.

422
00:22:39.631 --> 00:22:42.480
So do you really think that that'll play a role in the schools that you're able

423
00:22:42.481 --> 00:22:43.314
to get into?

424
00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:47.620
<v 2>Yeah,
absolutely.
It's sad to say,
but,
but there is a bias against conservatives,</v>

425
00:22:47.621 --> 00:22:49.210
especially like the top tier schools.

426
00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.220
Like right now I'm looking to apply to ivy's.

427
00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:56.470
It'd be great to get into Harvard or Columbia.
Um,
I really think I,
man,

428
00:22:56.471 --> 00:22:59.020
you'd be the reckoning of those places.
I really think that'd be awesome.

429
00:22:59.021 --> 00:23:03.130
I really think,
I think it's really important to be accredited.
Um,
you know,

430
00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:06.250
I might been thinking about Georgetown or Gw to work on the hill.

431
00:23:06.251 --> 00:23:09.110
I think that's great.
Um,
but you know,
I really,

432
00:23:09.111 --> 00:23:13.340
I really don't know what's next for me.
I really don't know.

433
00:23:13.341 --> 00:23:16.220
It's got to go to college.
I'm definitely going to stay with turning point.

434
00:23:16.221 --> 00:23:18.890
It's a great organization.
I'm still going to be conservative with,
don't worry,

435
00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:20.000
I'm not going to change.

436
00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:23.180
<v 1>Generally people don't go the other way.
Right.</v>

437
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:26.180
You're not going to suddenly grow up and be like,
Nah,
Nah.

438
00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:29.490
I'll go to the feelings.
Things that usually does,
I won't happen.
Yeah.

439
00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:31.150
But all right,
so you want to go to school,
but you,

440
00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:36.180
so you really do think that your,
your politics could affect,
I guess,

441
00:23:36.181 --> 00:23:37.920
you know,
they don't,
well,
what happened with David Hogg,
right?

442
00:23:37.921 --> 00:23:40.410
He didn't get into all,
I don't know what his grades are,

443
00:23:40.411 --> 00:23:42.240
but like he didn't get into a whole bunch of schools.
Right,
right.

444
00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:45.770
<v 2>I mean there've been rumors that had gone to Harvard,
northeastern,</v>

445
00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:51.230
it wouldn't surprise me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And what do you want to study?

446
00:23:51.231 --> 00:23:55.790
You have any idea?
It's either business or law.
I really don't know yet.
I just,

447
00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:56.720
you know,
I,

448
00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:00.470
I've always liked business and I think law is just absolutely phenomenal.

449
00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:03.440
Really don't know yet.
Uh,
but you know,

450
00:24:03.441 --> 00:24:06.630
it's going to be great to be on a college campus where,
you know,

451
00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.990
everyone is just really liberal.
That'll be fun.

452
00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.580
It's sort of weird and I guess this shows a little bit about the way the college

453
00:24:13.581 --> 00:24:16.550
experience is,
is going,
but in a bizarre way,

454
00:24:16.551 --> 00:24:18.440
just knowing you from the little bit that I know you,

455
00:24:18.441 --> 00:24:21.110
it's like in a way it's almost like you don't have to go to college.

456
00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:23.960
Like you definitely going to call.
Well,
I'm not saying you shouldn't.

457
00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:27.140
And I think there's all sorts of social reasons that somebody should go and you

458
00:24:27.141 --> 00:24:27.711
can,
you know,

459
00:24:27.711 --> 00:24:30.830
you learn and all sorts of other ways that aren't necessarily academic,

460
00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:31.281
but it's like,

461
00:24:31.281 --> 00:24:34.880
clearly you've got the academic thing down and can keep learning that way.

462
00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:38.270
So it's,
you know,
it's bizarre that people spend,
you know,

463
00:24:38.271 --> 00:24:42.620
20 grand a year to go to college when no one thing is,

464
00:24:42.621 --> 00:24:45.580
we're surrounded by a lot of great minds is what I'm saying saying I'm with you.

465
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:48.250
But the issue with colleges that you're basically paying to get yourself

466
00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:51.740
brainwashed with stupidity and that's suck part because there were actual like

467
00:24:51.741 --> 00:24:53.060
great things to learn in college.

468
00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.910
Just not like lesbian dance theory that says that a lot.

469
00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.900
Just some of these classes are just useless and you know,
and just,

470
00:24:59.901 --> 00:25:02.780
it's just straight up complete stupidity.

471
00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.280
A lot of the stuff that they're teaching there.

472
00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:09.400
So what do you make of how this seems to be a through line through education and

473
00:25:10.911 --> 00:25:15.320
I mean high school education,
college education,
clearly the media,

474
00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:20.300
like all of this sort of brainwashing stuff that you're talking about.

475
00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:24.740
It's always going against people like you.
And I see you on Twitter,
you,

476
00:25:24.741 --> 00:25:28.010
you take down CNN all the time,
you take down main street videos.

477
00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:32.260
People know my thoughts on this.
It's like I just wish like to me,
if these are,

478
00:25:32.261 --> 00:25:34.280
we just addressed that Twitter,
just Twitter's for fun.

479
00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:38.030
We have to stop taking Twitter.
So,
so like your bio,
your bio is perfect.

480
00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.740
Twitter's not real life.
It's not real life but peep.

481
00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:44.320
But the weird thing about that is it's starting to leak into real life.
I,

482
00:25:44.321 --> 00:25:48.350
I did a direct message like a year and a half ago or so about how online culture

483
00:25:48.351 --> 00:25:52.010
is becoming mainstream culture and I think that that really is what's happening

484
00:25:52.011 --> 00:25:53.420
here.
Twitter is not real life,

485
00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:56.760
but it's starting to like leak out into everyone's conversation.

486
00:25:56.761 --> 00:26:00.890
So Fox News and CNN and MSNBC or basically Trump's Twitter,
like Twitter is like,

487
00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.890
you know like have you seen shows where they basically read random replies to

488
00:26:03.891 --> 00:26:05.660
messages?
It's like John Smith,

489
00:26:05.661 --> 00:26:10.220
3.74 belongs to this like that.
And he was just so stupid.

490
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:12.510
But the biggest thing that we're seeing right now is,

491
00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:16.430
is a cultural shift with the youth.
Like memes.

492
00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:21.920
Memes have so much power and I was mad memes.
One,

493
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:26.870
a lot of memes helped so much for the trumps 2016 campaign with it really did.

494
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.680
Um,

495
00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:32.680
and social media has a huge influence on our beliefs and our actions and that's

496
00:26:33.921 --> 00:26:38.840
why it is so scary to see censorship of Conservatives online because that is

497
00:26:38.841 --> 00:26:43.841
basically like Twitter is basically the new version of you just yelling into a

498
00:26:44.461 --> 00:26:45.450
crowd.
Yeah.

499
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:50.190
And that's basically like the main form of everyone's communication and shutting

500
00:26:50.191 --> 00:26:53.970
that down.
It's like heavily restricting,
you know,

501
00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:56.610
I haven't developed my full opinion on this,
but it seems as such,

502
00:26:56.970 --> 00:27:00.330
restricting this restricts your,
like really restricts your First Amendment,

503
00:27:00.331 --> 00:27:00.950
right?

504
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:04.910
<v 1>Yeah.
So this is the whole issue about whether they're publishers or platforms.</v>

505
00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:05.130
Yeah.

506
00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:07.810
<v 2>The big issue,
I don't know if I'm saying this right,</v>

507
00:27:07.811 --> 00:27:10.670
but I think one of the things is if there are certain,
if there are,

508
00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:14.230
if there are published further than,
like they have a lot of legal liability.

509
00:27:14.231 --> 00:27:18.430
If they're a platform,
then everyone should say whatever they want,

510
00:27:18.431 --> 00:27:20.590
but that's not the case.
So it's like pick one

511
00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:26.080
and they're just completely censoring,
uh,
conservatives.
Like,

512
00:27:26.081 --> 00:27:29.680
I know Prager u gets like their videos demonetize so much.

513
00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:31.840
And have you video has gotten to monetize?
They probably,

514
00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:34.660
<v 1>yeah.
Well,
like now,
now it's gotten a little bit better,</v>

515
00:27:34.661 --> 00:27:37.650
but our video is just don't go out to feeds anymore.
I went on that Craig,

516
00:27:37.651 --> 00:27:39.100
and they don't dry out.
So rhythms.
Yeah,

517
00:27:39.101 --> 00:27:42.430
that crazy rampage I went on where I just started retweeting real people.

518
00:27:42.431 --> 00:27:46.420
I only did it with real people with real names saying they've been unsubscribed

519
00:27:46.421 --> 00:27:49.540
and they're getting hundreds and sometimes thousands of retweets and I'm tagging

520
00:27:49.541 --> 00:27:53.440
youtube and they just ignore me.
And it's like,
come on guys,

521
00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:56.610
you gotta play this game a little bit better.
Facebook and Twitter all

522
00:27:56.790 --> 00:28:00.350
<v 2>have proven biases.
Proven.</v>

523
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:04.610
<v 1>Yeah.
How worried are a,
we'll say it's only interesting to me because you,</v>

524
00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:09.600
you never,
you didn't grow up in a time when there was some sort of trustworthy,

525
00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:14.490
seemingly trustworthy level of the media.
Like CNN was not always this.

526
00:28:14.491 --> 00:28:16.380
The reason,
I don't even know if you know this,

527
00:28:16.381 --> 00:28:19.620
but the reason I think that so many people like me that are older than you

528
00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:24.770
attack CN and the most is Cassina and used to be decent like MSNBC saying we

529
00:28:25.081 --> 00:28:25.914
lean left

530
00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:30.090
and CNN saying that and it's like no you're not.

531
00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:31.770
We know exactly what you're doing.

532
00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:35.100
And that's why I always tax CNN cause it's like you guys have actually become

533
00:28:35.101 --> 00:28:38.610
the worst in the name of the ratings are like oh

534
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:42.920
<v 2>they were like the lowest.
It's like a block or read CNN.
Yeah.</v>

535
00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.430
So here's what I think.

536
00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:50.450
I think that a lot of young people and like Ma an average Americans do not trust

537
00:28:51.121 --> 00:28:54.090
the media anymore and they have sought out individuals instead.

538
00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:57.090
So they trust individuals.
So they look to you,
they look to Ben,
they,

539
00:28:57.290 --> 00:29:00.210
they look to Guy Benson,
you know Charlie Kirk for,

540
00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.490
for their news because they trust the individual.

541
00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:06.760
<v 1>Right.
Do you see a great risk in that too?
Cause I'm worried about it.</v>

542
00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:08.000
<v 2>No.
I also put,</v>

543
00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:12.100
but the thing is with that is that you have absolute liability for what you say.

544
00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:15.700
You know,
CNN can come whip something up or you know,
but when,

545
00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:20.940
when an individual like tweets something it's on like they're responsible for

546
00:29:21.461 --> 00:29:22.294
their actions.

547
00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.233
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

548
00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:26.060
So one of the things I've been saying lately is that I'm actually in a bizarre

549
00:29:26.061 --> 00:29:29.720
way less interested in politics now than I've ever been,

550
00:29:29.721 --> 00:29:33.260
but I'm interested in what you referenced a little while ago,
this culture thing,

551
00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:37.000
culture,
where does it cultures,
politics is downstream from culture.
Yeah.

552
00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:40.040
That's so true.
Yeah.
So do you see that really as,

553
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:44.260
as sort of the of all this that it's not going to be about all of the little

554
00:29:44.261 --> 00:29:47.380
machinations of politics,
it's just going to be about,
I mean this,

555
00:29:47.381 --> 00:29:49.120
I guess this is the strength of Trump.
Well,

556
00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:53.350
where you'd argue it's either the strength or the,
the the worst part of Trump.

557
00:29:53.351 --> 00:29:57.130
I suppose that is a cultural thing.
Not necessarily a political thing.

558
00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:02.120
<v 2>No,
I mean there,
there are pros and cons to that,
but we just,</v>

559
00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:06.240
we have to play by the rules that are set by society and these are the rules,

560
00:30:06.241 --> 00:30:09.990
these little rules,
that culture has a massive impact on society.

561
00:30:09.991 --> 00:30:14.490
And whether I like it or not,
that Kanye is Kanye speaking out.
First of all,

562
00:30:14.491 --> 00:30:16.260
I think it's great that be speaking out to the First Amendment right.

563
00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:21.600
I don't think we should be propping up opinions by celebrities simply because

564
00:30:21.601 --> 00:30:22.200
they're famous.

565
00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:26.280
You have to show that you are informed on the subject and that's that.

566
00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:29.760
But it doesn't take a political genius to say that I believe in our second

567
00:30:29.761 --> 00:30:31.710
amendment and our first amendment that doesn't take,

568
00:30:31.711 --> 00:30:36.300
but Taylor swift doing like a 7,000 page essay,
you know,

569
00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:40.530
that makes absolutely no sense and contradicts itself written by like a liberal,

570
00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:44.280
you know,
a worker on the hill.

571
00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:45.483
<v 1>That's,
yeah,</v>

572
00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:48.890
I was disappointed in that just because I have no particular feelings about her

573
00:30:48.891 --> 00:30:53.420
when I don't care.
I honestly,
I don't think I could name one song or whatever,

574
00:30:53.421 --> 00:30:56.780
but it's just like the fact that she stayed out of politics I liked,
I was like,

575
00:30:56.810 --> 00:31:00.590
oh,
whatever she's doing or whatever her handlers are saying to her.

576
00:31:00.591 --> 00:31:01.460
I kind of like it.

577
00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:04.390
And then she got in on this and it's like I don't care which way she was going

578
00:31:04.391 --> 00:31:07.370
to break.
I was just like,
ah,
we just,
this is not what we need.

579
00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:12.300
<v 2>Yeah.
I mean,
Taylor swift effect president is like down Marsha Blackburn above.</v>

580
00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:14.630
So thanks Taylor swift.
No,
but,

581
00:31:14.631 --> 00:31:19.631
but w w we saw right now by the left is that they are losing their stranglehold

582
00:31:19.901 --> 00:31:22.930
on culture and that is very frightening for them.

583
00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.780
And we saw that with Connie and Connie started speaking out,

584
00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:30.490
I gave my speech about this and they started off with mob tactics that didn't

585
00:31:30.491 --> 00:31:34.960
work.
Uh,
emotional appeal.
The teams,
he guy was basically begging him like,
Kanye,

586
00:31:34.961 --> 00:31:36.840
please man,
take,
take off your hat,
man.

587
00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:39.630
It hurts me emotionally because I was like,
no,
it's my first own right.

588
00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:44.250
I'm not taking it off.
And then we saw I'm just blatant racism.
Yeah.

589
00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:48.870
File a character.
Assassinations and he's still [inaudible].
You wouldn't that,

590
00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:53.230
that,
that is,
how does that fly?
He wouldn't bow down to the mob.
Absolutely.

591
00:31:53.231 --> 00:31:54.870
What input,
but no,

592
00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:59.530
they're losing their stranglehold on culture and whether I like that we are

593
00:31:59.531 --> 00:32:04.210
putting so much emphasis on my cultural icon,
those are the rules.

594
00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:08.040
Them.
The rule is like they say that on Twitter a lot,
their rules.
Um,

595
00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:10.510
but this is,
this is,

596
00:32:10.511 --> 00:32:13.600
this is the reality that we're living in and we have to understand that.

597
00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:19.480
And what's happening with Kanye is a real shift,

598
00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:23.320
especially for African Americans and people who are looking a little tinos.

599
00:32:23.321 --> 00:32:24.340
They're basically saying,

600
00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:28.570
I don't know why this controversial Blackstone have to be Democrats.

601
00:32:28.571 --> 00:32:31.060
You don't own me.
That's all there is.
Basically that's all he's saying.

602
00:32:31.061 --> 00:32:36.061
And he has created such like a pivotal moment that says you're,

603
00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:38.590
you don't,
you're stranglehold doesn't affect me.

604
00:32:38.591 --> 00:32:41.360
Cause I know in Hollywood like the second you say something like,

605
00:32:41.361 --> 00:32:44.120
I remember someone said bench murals are nice guy.
His career was

606
00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:46.210
<v 1>droid.
Mark Duplass who's a friend of mine,</v>

607
00:32:46.211 --> 00:32:50.110
he's been on his show and he had to issue an apology and it's like,
you know,

608
00:32:50.111 --> 00:32:52.150
oddly whereas the world,
the idea of people,

609
00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:55.430
people came to his defense at first basically saying,
you know,

610
00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.760
you should be allowed to say that.
And then unfortunately

611
00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:01.170
<v 2>black and black,
especially young blacks are saying,
look,</v>

612
00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:05.730
they look up to Kanye West.
They millions look up to him and they say,

613
00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:09.330
this individual,
why does this individual think this way?

614
00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:13.950
And even more so he didn't bow down to the mob,
which is fantastic.

615
00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:18.000
And we're seeing like a real shift.
I don't know the 38% number,

616
00:33:18.001 --> 00:33:19.980
we're 38% African American approval over Trump.

617
00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:21.420
I don't know if that's necessarily true.

618
00:33:21.421 --> 00:33:24.180
All I know is that there was a 3% jump from there in August.

619
00:33:24.181 --> 00:33:27.930
The black approval rating of Trump was 3% one of the last latest polls that I

620
00:33:27.931 --> 00:33:32.660
know month or so ago was 10% so there is a big jump.
Uh,

621
00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:33.020
you know what?

622
00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:36.690
We're seeing that so many young African Americans are so energized.

623
00:33:36.691 --> 00:33:40.230
Like I know turning point is doing a black leadership summit and like a week and

624
00:33:40.231 --> 00:33:41.064
the White House,

625
00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:46.730
we're going to get just 400 African American young individuals to be able to

626
00:33:46.981 --> 00:33:48.780
speak their two times table,
listen.

627
00:33:48.781 --> 00:33:53.781
And to see that the left is losing their stranglehold on culture.

628
00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:57.600
And it is scary for them because that is the one thing that they have left.

629
00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:00.660
All right.
I got two more for you.
All right.

630
00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:02.280
<v 1>You,
are you in the prediction game at all?</v>

631
00:34:02.281 --> 00:34:04.530
What do you think's going to happen in these midterms?
We've got coming up.

632
00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:06.560
<v 2>So what I've been hearing is that</v>

633
00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:12.260
Republicans are to lose it in the house and gain in the Senate.
Uh,

634
00:34:12.261 --> 00:34:15.090
I love how a cause your work has,
is that we're going to win back the executive.

635
00:34:15.091 --> 00:34:15.170
Yeah.

636
00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:19.220
<v 1>These midterms.
I was like
very confused about a lot</v>

637
00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:23.590
<v 2>close.
Yeah.
But look,
the Cavenaugh effect is real.</v>

638
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.490
Like this was like the,
all the left had to do was sit down,
be quiet,

639
00:34:27.491 --> 00:34:31.570
be civil plaintiffs to like,
no,
no,
this is,
we're not gonna allow this.
Okay.

640
00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:34.360
And they hit themselves in the foot with the club and then there started crying

641
00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:36.940
and they did the same thing with Connie and that was great.

642
00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:42.150
So the Cavenaugh really amped up and energized the conservative base.

643
00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.610
And even more so,
it finally gave the conservative,

644
00:34:45.611 --> 00:34:48.120
like the conservatives a backbone,
like Lindsey Graham,

645
00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:52.960
Lindsey Graham 2.0 or is this Guy Ben.
I love it.
And like bill Cassidy.
But,

646
00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:54.850
but here's the peers.
The interesting thing.

647
00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:59.950
Women were the most angered by all of this.

648
00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:01.870
Before the cabin in August,

649
00:35:01.871 --> 00:35:06.871
it was like 35.7% approval of Trump after it was a 40.7 and the F in August,

650
00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:08.223
um,

651
00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:12.730
Democrats at a 12 point lead over republicans in a voter enthusiasm.

652
00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:15.760
Now it's 64% republicans,
65 Democrats.

653
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.280
So we are neck and neck in this and it's all thanks to the Democrats.

654
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:21.740
<v 1>Yeah,
I mean my gut,
as long as you're doing predictions here,</v>

655
00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:25.610
I actually think the Republicans or do well in both the house and the Senate.

656
00:35:25.611 --> 00:35:28.490
I really hope so.
But I do think so because I agree.

657
00:35:28.491 --> 00:35:33.410
I think this mob mentality and watching these videos of Antifa and Portland and

658
00:35:33.411 --> 00:35:38.120
Hillary saying we can't be civil and Eric Holder saying go low.
We them them and

659
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.390
<v 2>it's like,
man,</v>

660
00:35:39.391 --> 00:35:44.391
if you stand for due process and civil society and all of those things,

661
00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:48.990
that thing needs to burn it.
It kind of sucks,
but it's like that,

662
00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:54.020
that set of ideas thinks the left just completely disregards the constitution.

663
00:35:56.610 --> 00:35:59.870
The constitution was written and like the amendment,

664
00:35:59.871 --> 00:36:02.370
the bill of rights was forced by anti federalists to make sure that the

665
00:36:02.371 --> 00:36:05.280
government could not become tyrannical and abuse its power.

666
00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:08.190
And this is so important and it's protecting the rights of the individuals in

667
00:36:08.191 --> 00:36:11.790
these rights.
Why or why do we not all agree on them?

668
00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:14.130
Why is it wrong to believe new process?

669
00:36:14.131 --> 00:36:17.040
Why is it wrong to say I believe that individuals should have the right to

670
00:36:17.041 --> 00:36:21.630
defend themselves and also defend against the tyranny of a possible government?

671
00:36:21.631 --> 00:36:21.721
Look,

672
00:36:21.721 --> 00:36:25.080
second man was basically written because the founders had just fought against

673
00:36:25.081 --> 00:36:27.690
Great Britain and they had seen how a tyrannical government quickly become.

674
00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:28.523
So one more thing I didn't know.

675
00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:31.890
The first thing tyrannical governments do is they take away the weapons of the

676
00:36:31.891 --> 00:36:35.160
civilians.
So I was in Nazi Germany,
we saw this in China,
we saw this in,

677
00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:37.590
in Cambodia.
That's the first thing they do.
Uh,

678
00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:40.090
and the individual right to bear arms is,

679
00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:42.780
is every individual is not related to the militia clause.

680
00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:45.960
So it's basically saying every individual has the right to protect themselves

681
00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:47.720
and even more so it's,

682
00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:52.590
it's necessary for the protection of a free state.
All right,

683
00:36:52.591 --> 00:36:55.410
one more for you.
Hit me with,
they don't play video games as much.

684
00:36:55.411 --> 00:36:58.830
I know cause you don't have time.
What do you do for fun,
man?
What's fun?

685
00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:01.920
I used to sites.
Twitter.
You can't just tell them to Twitter.

686
00:37:01.921 --> 00:37:03.960
I know you're having put on a computer,
but it can't just be Twitter.

687
00:37:03.961 --> 00:37:07.330
What are you doing for fun with me?
I used to play a lot of video games.

688
00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:10.350
What kind of game?
So here's,
here's my progression.
I haven't said this,

689
00:37:10.351 --> 00:37:13.240
but this is like a scoop.
I used to play world of tanks.
Okay.

690
00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:18.470
Advent moved to to a rocket league.
Okay.
It's sockets.

691
00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:21.630
Terrible game.
It's boring.
Then it moved to,
so I played Overwatch.

692
00:37:21.631 --> 00:37:24.570
I played Paladins,
I played pub g and then I played for night and four,
nine.

693
00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:29.020
This was when the shooting occurred and I just stopped dead in my tracks because

694
00:37:29.021 --> 00:37:30.450
it was just,
it's a waste of time.

695
00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:35.850
And I see my younger brothers who were addicted to the game and it's just sad to

696
00:37:35.851 --> 00:37:38.610
see that this is the state of our youth,

697
00:37:38.611 --> 00:37:40.530
that they're just completely addicted to technology.

698
00:37:40.531 --> 00:37:44.640
Like I'm sure if I have kids,
okay,
they're not saying a phone till they're 12.

699
00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:48.670
It even if they do call me or nine one,
one that's no video games.

700
00:37:48.671 --> 00:37:52.080
You're reading a book.
I don't care.
So what do you do for fun?

701
00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:54.510
You just [inaudible] you told me what you're used to do.
Okay.
Come on.

702
00:37:54.511 --> 00:37:56.560
You must be having fun somewhere.
You're having fun sometimes.

703
00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:04.110
Wow,
I got you.
Yeah man you did.
No,
but you're,
you are having fun with this.

704
00:38:04.111 --> 00:38:07.920
I actually have some of some of the remaining friends that I have,
uh,

705
00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:11.460
which are really solid friends.
You know,
on weekends we hang out a,

706
00:38:11.461 --> 00:38:14.790
we'd go watch movies and stuff like that.
In addition,
I,
I just think it's great.

707
00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:18.190
One of the greatest things for me for having fun is just simply talking to like

708
00:38:18.191 --> 00:38:18.901
minded kids,

709
00:38:18.901 --> 00:38:22.080
like young individuals at these turning point events that we run and it's great.

710
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:25.740
And like meeting with and pushing policy and stuff like that.

711
00:38:25.741 --> 00:38:26.610
It's just fantastic.

712
00:38:26.611 --> 00:38:30.090
Like one of the greatest feelings ever was like passing the Stop School Violence

713
00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:32.970
Act and fix the Knicks like the stops,
Galvan Sec,
um,

714
00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:36.000
appropriated funds $2 billion in,
um,

715
00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:38.350
for the protection of schools like hardening schools,

716
00:38:38.351 --> 00:38:41.470
metal detectors are making better communication for law enforcement,
training,

717
00:38:41.471 --> 00:38:43.690
law enforcement teachers and students.
And in addition,

718
00:38:43.691 --> 00:38:46.720
there was a clause that said none of this money will be used for firearm,

719
00:38:46.721 --> 00:38:47.770
a firearm trainings.

720
00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:53.200
So this was like the greatest win for the left and they still hate it,
the bill.

721
00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:56.410
And like the march for life,
kids hated it.
But no,

722
00:38:56.411 --> 00:39:00.340
I mean I'm really dead set on making sure that school shootings just are a thing

723
00:39:00.341 --> 00:39:04.530
of the past.
They never happen again.
Uh,
and you love what you do,
man.
Yeah,
man.

724
00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:05.560
It's just like,

725
00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:09.310
just learning about second amendment and just like being more knowledgeable and

726
00:39:09.311 --> 00:39:12.730
having these debates and discussions are just like,
they really make my day.
Yeah.

727
00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.320
Well I think it goes without saying.
I mean,

728
00:39:14.321 --> 00:39:17.770
I think you have an absurdly bright future.
Thank you.
You're like,

729
00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:20.380
you're going to run for president or something.
Probably not,

730
00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:25.210
but you left a little window.
Yeah.
No,
I mean,
I literally do.

731
00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:30.370
Maybe there's a thing,
um,
for politics like the hill in the future.
Right now,

732
00:39:30.371 --> 00:39:34.140
I'm just dead set on going to college,
getting my degree,
learning,
uh,

733
00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:37.390
staying the political sphere.
But,
uh,
you know,
who knows.

734
00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:41.350
I'm definitely supporting Nikki Haley's Shapiro 2024 ago.
Right.

735
00:39:41.351 --> 00:39:44.830
You see people there is hope for the future.
