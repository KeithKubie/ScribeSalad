00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.880
Whether or not you realize it,

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.560
as a surfer you’re a master 
of complicated physics.

00:00:15.563 --> 00:00:17.273
The science of surfing begins

00:00:17.273 --> 00:00:21.033
as soon as you and your board 
first hit the water.

00:00:21.033 --> 00:00:25.663
The board’s size and light construction 
help it displace a lot of water.

00:00:25.663 --> 00:00:27.743
In turn, a buoyant force

00:00:27.743 --> 00:00:31.323
equal to the weight of the 
displaced water pushes up,

00:00:31.323 --> 00:00:34.223
counteracting you and your board’s weight.

00:00:34.223 --> 00:00:38.113
This lets you stay afloat while 
you wait to paddle for a wave.

00:00:38.113 --> 00:00:40.333
And what exactly are you waiting for?

00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.293
The perfect wave, of course.

00:00:42.293 --> 00:00:49.383
Like other waves in physics, ocean waves
represent a transfer of energy.

00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:54.283
Wind blowing across the ocean accelerates 
water particles near the surface,

00:00:54.283 --> 00:00:58.111
leading to the growth of ripples 
that become waves.

00:00:58.111 --> 00:01:02.651
These deviations from the flat surface 
are acted upon by gravity,

00:01:02.651 --> 00:01:08.446
which tries to restore the surface 
to its original flat state.

00:01:08.446 --> 00:01:10.692
As the waves then move through the water,

00:01:10.692 --> 00:01:16.022
particles push and pull on their neighbors
through the wave induced pressure,

00:01:16.022 --> 00:01:22.152
and this motion propagates energy through 
the water in unison with the wave motion.

00:01:22.152 --> 00:01:23.714
The motion of these particles

00:01:23.714 --> 00:01:27.474
is much more limited than the 
overall motion of the waves.

00:01:27.474 --> 00:01:28.514
Near the shore,

00:01:28.514 --> 00:01:32.254
the shallower seafloor constrains 
the motion of the waves

00:01:32.254 --> 00:01:35.774
to occur in a more limited region 
than out at sea,

00:01:35.774 --> 00:01:38.664
concentrating the wave energy 
near the surface.

00:01:38.664 --> 00:01:42.054
If the topography of the shoreline 
is even and smooth,

00:01:42.054 --> 00:01:44.994
this will refract the waves 
to become more

00:01:44.994 --> 00:01:48.054
parallel to the shore as they approach.

00:01:48.054 --> 00:01:50.334
This is the crucial moment.

00:01:50.334 --> 00:01:51.744
As the wave gets near,

00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:55.524
you quickly pivot your board 
in the same direction as the wave

00:01:55.524 --> 00:01:58.474
and paddle to match its speed.

00:01:58.474 --> 00:02:01.224
Your board forms an angle with the water,

00:02:01.224 --> 00:02:05.024
and this creates a dynamic pressure 
on the bottom of it,

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:07.764
forcing you and your board 
out of the water,

00:02:07.764 --> 00:02:09.944
to skim along the surface.

00:02:09.944 --> 00:02:11.144
At the same time,

00:02:11.144 --> 00:02:15.144
your increased forward momentum 
makes you more stable,

00:02:15.144 --> 00:02:19.144
allowing you to stand up 
and surf along the wave.

00:02:19.144 --> 00:02:20.574
Now you’ve caught the wave,

00:02:20.574 --> 00:02:24.814
and are riding along its front 
face parallel to the shoreline.

00:02:24.814 --> 00:02:29.115
Fins on the surfboard allow you to alter 
your speed and direction

00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:30.996
by repositioning your weight.

00:02:30.996 --> 00:02:33.106
Above you is the wave’s crest,

00:02:33.106 --> 00:02:37.326
where the water particles are undergoing
their greatest acceleration.

00:02:37.326 --> 00:02:41.155
That forces them to move faster 
than the underlying wave,

00:02:41.155 --> 00:02:45.225
so they shoot ahead before falling under
gravity’s influence.

00:02:45.225 --> 00:02:49.181
This forms the waves’ characteristic
curls, or jets,

00:02:49.181 --> 00:02:51.201
as they break along the shore.

00:02:51.201 --> 00:02:55.451
Sometimes, the curl might completely 
enclose part of the wave,

00:02:55.451 --> 00:02:59.441
forming a moving tube of water 
known as the barrel.

00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:03.491
Because of irregularities in the seafloor 
and the swell itself,

00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:09.641
few barrels last as long as the legendary 
27-second ride off the coast of Namibia.

00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:11.971
But many who manage to get barreled

00:03:11.971 --> 00:03:15.981
have said they feel time 
passing differently inside,

00:03:15.981 --> 00:03:20.320
making it one of the most magical 
experiences a surfer can have.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.065
Of course,

00:03:21.065 --> 00:03:23.655
not all beaches are created equal.

00:03:23.655 --> 00:03:27.255
Offshore underwater canyons or rock
formations

00:03:27.255 --> 00:03:31.735
in certain locations like Nazare, Portugal
or Mavericks, California

00:03:31.735 --> 00:03:35.884
refract the incoming wave energy 
into a single spot,

00:03:35.884 --> 00:03:40.074
creating massive waves 
sought by surfers worldwide.

00:03:40.074 --> 00:03:43.502
And some of these waves travel 
for more than a week,

00:03:43.502 --> 00:03:48.572
with swells originating more than 10,000 
kilometers away from shore.

00:03:48.572 --> 00:03:50.925
Waves surfed in sunny California

00:03:50.925 --> 00:03:55.495
may have originated in the stormy 
seas near New Zealand.

00:03:55.495 --> 00:03:59.365
So while you may not be thinking about 
weather patterns in the South Pacific,

00:03:59.365 --> 00:04:02.595
tectonic geology, or fluid mechanics,

00:04:02.595 --> 00:04:08.015
the art of catching the perfect wave 
relies on all these things and more.

00:04:08.021 --> 00:04:10.791
And the waves we surf, created by wind,

00:04:10.791 --> 00:04:15.641
are just one visible part of the 
continuous oscillation of energy

00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:19.610
that has shaped our universe 
since its very beginning.
