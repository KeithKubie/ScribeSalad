00:00:00.372 --> 00:00:01.205
- [Voiceover] Alright, now we're ready

00:00:01.205 --> 00:00:04.252
to learn how to do circuit analysis.

00:00:04.252 --> 00:00:05.965
This is what we've been shooting for

00:00:05.965 --> 00:00:08.322
as we've learned our Fundamental Laws.

00:00:08.322 --> 00:00:11.655
And the fundamental laws are, Ohm's law,

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:17.031
and Kirchhoff's laws,

00:00:17.031 --> 00:00:19.590
which we learned was
Kirchhoff's Current Law

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.554
and Kirchhoff's Voltage Law.

00:00:22.554 --> 00:00:25.929
This says that the sum of all
the currents going into a node

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:27.912
adds up to zero.

00:00:27.912 --> 00:00:31.081
And the Voltage Law says
the sum of the voltages

00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:34.085
going around a loop adds up to zero.

00:00:34.085 --> 00:00:37.666
And the other thing we learned
was the sign convention.

00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:41.079
So, we had a passive sign convention,

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:44.854
which was, if I label
the voltage like that,

00:00:44.854 --> 00:00:49.548
then I label the current
flowing into the positive end,

00:00:49.548 --> 00:00:52.152
the positive end and
the current go together.

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:54.347
So, these are the tools that we have

00:00:54.347 --> 00:00:58.445
for analyzing a circuit and
I've drawn a circuit here.

00:00:58.445 --> 00:01:01.777
So, what we see is, we
have a voltage source,

00:01:01.777 --> 00:01:05.944
we'll call that VS, and we'll
give it a value of 15 volts.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.837
We have a resistor, R1,

00:01:11.383 --> 00:01:15.550
that has a value, we'll give
that a value of four K ohms.

00:01:19.283 --> 00:01:24.008
And another resistor, R2
is sitting right here,

00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:28.175
and we'll give it a value
of 2 K ohms, 2,000 ohms.

00:01:30.105 --> 00:01:34.168
And finally, there's a current
source sitting over here.

00:01:34.168 --> 00:01:37.418
And this has a value of three milliamps

00:01:39.421 --> 00:01:40.921
flowing downwards.

00:01:41.988 --> 00:01:45.014
So, the point of circuit analysis
means what we wanna do is,

00:01:45.014 --> 00:01:47.125
we wanna find all the
currents and all the voltages

00:01:47.125 --> 00:01:50.705
in this circuit using
our Fundamental Laws.

00:01:50.705 --> 00:01:54.488
So first, let's identify
the nodes in the circuit.

00:01:54.488 --> 00:01:56.398
We'll give them letter names.

00:01:56.398 --> 00:01:57.338
We'll call this node A,

00:01:57.338 --> 00:02:01.273
and that's the junction between R1 and Vs.

00:02:01.273 --> 00:02:02.946
We'll give this one a name,

00:02:02.946 --> 00:02:05.019
this is a node that's distributed,

00:02:05.019 --> 00:02:08.514
all three of these components
joined right about here,

00:02:08.514 --> 00:02:11.117
we'll call that node B.

00:02:11.117 --> 00:02:12.905
And that's one of the nodes.

00:02:12.905 --> 00:02:14.652
And down at the bottom here,
there's the third node,

00:02:14.652 --> 00:02:17.534
which is this distributed node here.

00:02:17.534 --> 00:02:20.060
It connects the voltage
source, the resistor,

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.008
and the current source, and this is all,

00:02:24.008 --> 00:02:25.925
we'll call that node C.

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:30.896
Now, we could also label
some voltages on here.

00:02:32.437 --> 00:02:35.080
We'll label the voltages,
we'll do that in orange.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.831
We'll call this V1 and we'll
give it a plus sign here.

00:02:39.831 --> 00:02:43.695
And the minus sign here,
that's the voltage across R1.

00:02:43.695 --> 00:02:46.135
We'll give R2 a name,
we'll get the voltage here,

00:02:46.135 --> 00:02:48.718
we'll call this plus, minus V2.

00:02:51.464 --> 00:02:53.140
That's the voltage across R2,

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.899
it's also the voltage
across the current source.

00:02:57.899 --> 00:03:01.732
B, it's the voltage
between node B and node C.

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:05.379
And now let's label the currents.

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:09.414
Let's label the currents in this circuit.

00:03:09.414 --> 00:03:10.831
We have a current

00:03:13.212 --> 00:03:16.379
coming through R1, we'll call that i1.

00:03:17.647 --> 00:03:20.818
There's another current going through R2

00:03:20.818 --> 00:03:22.735
and we'll call that i2.

00:03:25.607 --> 00:03:27.044
There's a current going here through Is

00:03:27.044 --> 00:03:31.211
and we actually already know
that, we'll just call that Is.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:35.427
And that's all the currents,

00:03:35.427 --> 00:03:39.529
that's all the unknown
currents in our circuit.

00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:42.532
If we stare at this, we're
not gonna be able to tell,

00:03:42.532 --> 00:03:45.945
on just inspecting this, what's going on,

00:03:45.945 --> 00:03:48.586
we have to come up with
some solution technique.

00:03:48.586 --> 00:03:50.489
And we're going to solve
this by, what's called,

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.616
Application of the Fundamental Laws.

00:03:53.616 --> 00:03:55.362
And here's our laws over here.

00:03:55.362 --> 00:03:59.529
And the whole technique is
based on solving simultaneous

00:04:04.915 --> 00:04:05.748
equations.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.295
That's the skill of circuit analysis,

00:04:12.295 --> 00:04:14.285
circuit analysis means setting up

00:04:14.285 --> 00:04:17.739
and solving simultaneous equations.

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.643
So, let's write down some things
we know about the circuit.

00:04:21.643 --> 00:04:23.512
And first thing we're gonna apply is,

00:04:23.512 --> 00:04:27.060
we'll apply Ohm's law
to the two resistors.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.227
So, we can say

00:04:29.391 --> 00:04:31.224
V1 equals i1 times R1.

00:04:37.742 --> 00:04:41.242
And we can say that V2 equals i2 times R2.

00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:52.607
Alright, that's not a bad
start, we have two equations,

00:04:52.607 --> 00:04:54.487
how many unknowns do we have?

00:04:54.487 --> 00:04:56.320
I2 and V2 are unknown.

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:59.762
I1 and R1 are unknown.

00:04:59.762 --> 00:05:02.514
So, we have four unknowns
and we have two equations,

00:05:02.514 --> 00:05:04.514
so, we're halfway there.

00:05:05.686 --> 00:05:09.796
And now, we need to come up
with some more equations.

00:05:09.796 --> 00:05:11.196
And I'm just gonna stare at the circuit

00:05:11.196 --> 00:05:12.292
and what I'm gonna do is,

00:05:12.292 --> 00:05:15.792
I'm gonna apply KVL around this loop here,

00:05:20.298 --> 00:05:22.631
that's gonna be my KVL loop.

00:05:24.608 --> 00:05:28.021
And after we get that equation,
what we're gonna do is,

00:05:28.021 --> 00:05:30.461
we're gonna write KCL,

00:05:30.461 --> 00:05:34.128
we're gonna write the
Current Law at node B.

00:05:37.954 --> 00:05:41.576
That's the two equations
we're gonna develop here.

00:05:41.576 --> 00:05:42.993
So, let's do KVL.

00:05:45.755 --> 00:05:50.453
Let's start at this node, at
this corner of the circuit

00:05:50.453 --> 00:05:53.661
and go around clockwise around.

00:05:53.661 --> 00:05:57.244
And what we'll see
first is a voltage rise,

00:06:01.442 --> 00:06:02.275
plus Vs.

00:06:04.923 --> 00:06:08.860
Next, I see a voltage
drop, so it's minus V1,

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.610
going around this way, minus V1.

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:15.970
I'm at this point, now
I'm gonna go through R2

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:20.137
and I see a voltage drop of
V2, minus V2 equals zero.

00:06:26.101 --> 00:06:30.533
That's Kirchhoff's Voltage
Law around this loop.

00:06:30.533 --> 00:06:33.950
One rise, two drops, one rise, two drops.

00:06:37.732 --> 00:06:40.615
Now, we're gonna move up here,

00:06:40.615 --> 00:06:44.782
and do Kirchhoff's Current
Law at this node right here.

00:06:46.225 --> 00:06:48.459
So let me draw a few more arrows.

00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:52.542
This is i1, it comes right
through that resistor.

00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:54.789
And this is Is.

00:06:58.274 --> 00:06:59.629
So Kirchhoff's Current Law,

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:03.768
let's count the currents
going into node B,

00:07:03.768 --> 00:07:06.435
current going into node B is i1.

00:07:09.725 --> 00:07:12.210
Currents go out, we'll set that equal

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.218
to the sum of the currents
going out of node B.

00:07:15.218 --> 00:07:17.801
So, that's equal to i2 plus Is.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:31.536
So look, now I have my four equations,

00:07:31.536 --> 00:07:34.703
here's my four simultaneous equations.

00:07:36.675 --> 00:07:40.005
And this is what we have to solve.

00:07:40.005 --> 00:07:44.172
So let me move the screen up
and we'll start doing that.

00:07:46.431 --> 00:07:47.264
Let's do a double check,

00:07:47.264 --> 00:07:50.431
we have four unknowns, V1, i1,

00:07:50.431 --> 00:07:51.264
V2, i2.

00:07:52.628 --> 00:07:55.822
Here's V1 and V2, and here's i1 and i2.

00:07:55.822 --> 00:07:59.989
And I have four equations, so
we oughta be able to do this.
