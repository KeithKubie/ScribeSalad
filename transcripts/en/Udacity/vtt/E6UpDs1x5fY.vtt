00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.108
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; For the first point we know it's 0,20 so here's 0 and then I go up 20, so

00:00:05.108 --> 00:00:10.594
this one is on our line. The next point is 1,22. I notice that this box is at

00:00:10.594 --> 00:00:16.309
1,24 so this can't be right. If I drive 2 miles, I pay $24, 2 miles and $24, so

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:22.375
this is on our line. If I drive 3 miles, I pay $26. $26 would be halfway between

00:00:22.375 --> 00:00:28.557
24 and 28. So it'd be right here. So this point and this point don't satisfy our

00:00:28.557 --> 00:00:34.390
equation. If I drive 4 miles, I pay $28. So this one is correct. If I were to

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.798
drive 5 miles, I would have to pay two more dollars so, 30. But this point has a

00:00:40.798 --> 00:00:46.802
y value of 32, and I know if I drive 5 miles, I only pay $30. So, this isn't on

00:00:46.802 --> 00:00:52.946
our graph. And, finally if I 6 six miles, I know I would have to pay $32. So,

00:00:52.946 --> 00:00:55.093
this point is on our graph.
