00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.272
- A talk on a project to look at

00:00:14.272 --> 00:00:17.220
dementia and developmental disabilities,

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.497
from two individuals from
the Arc of San Francisco.

00:00:20.497 --> 00:00:23.140
Jennifer Dresen, who's the Chief of Health

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.960
and Housing Services, and Joanne Rolle,

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.973
who is the Chief of Services,
Outcomes, and Compliance.

00:00:32.174 --> 00:00:34.424
(applause)

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.233
- Good afternoon; excuse me.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.530
Really happy to be here
today; I'm Jennifer, Joanne.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.490
And we're going to be talking to you today

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.690
about our experiences and partnership

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.730
with other expert
organizations in their field

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.140
to improve outcomes for our clients.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.973
And, before we start,

00:00:55.973 --> 00:00:58.190
I'd like to give a thanks

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.200
to Kristin Raines, who is our
Community Support Coordinator,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.870
for the project that we are
going to be talking about,

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.951
and she put a lot of
work into this PowerPoint

00:01:05.951 --> 00:01:06.970
along with us.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.293
So I just wanted to give
her a little shout-out.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.013
I have to ...

00:01:11.923 --> 00:01:14.256
- (mumbles)

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.850
- Ah ha, there we go, thank you, okay.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.150
So we have no disclosures.

00:01:22.684 --> 00:01:27.684
All right, so after
the presentation today,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.086
we hope you have learned
how we have leveraged

00:01:30.086 --> 00:01:33.520
our expertise among partner organizations,

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.210
the prevalence of dementia
in adults with IDD,

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.570
how dementia looks different
in adults with IDD,

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.570
how to provide support to adults with IDD

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.890
and dementia, and their caregivers.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.790
We'll provide you with some resources.

00:01:51.717 --> 00:01:54.460
- Just a little bit about
the project background.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.260
In 2016, the San Francisco Department

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.090
of Aging and Adult Services,
also known as DAAS,

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.370
applied for a federal grant

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.690
from the Administration
on Community Living

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.563
to reach underserved communities.

00:02:09.477 --> 00:02:13.024
The Alzheimer's Association
wanted to access

00:02:13.024 --> 00:02:16.010
and serve the Chinese community,

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.610
persons living alone in public housing,

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.240
and adults with
developmental disabilities.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.120
The Arc partnered with UCSF

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.020
to provide dementia evaluations

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.910
of adults with Down syndrome,

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.280
both as experiencing symptoms,

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.130
and adults who are asymptomatic.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.800
We also reached out to
Golden Gate Regional Center

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.830
to offer training and support to staff,

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.233
vendors, paid caregivers,
and family members.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.700
Due to improved health
care, social services,

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.740
and a decrease in institutionalization,

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.320
people with IDD are living
longer and more fulfilling lives.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.805
According to a 2015 report

00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:04.320
by the Coalition for Compassionate Care,

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.500
in 1940, the average lifespan for a person

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.115
with intellectual and
developmental disability

00:03:10.115 --> 00:03:12.483
was just over 20 years.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.370
By 1960, the average life
expectancy had risen to 30 years.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.940
Today, the average life
expectancy is 65 years,

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.600
just five years below
the general population.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.630
For adults with Down syndrome,

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.870
the average lifespan is now 56.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.860
According to the CDC, there are

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.122
approximately 650,000
adults age 60 or older

00:03:39.122 --> 00:03:42.010
with intellectual and
developmental disabilities

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.942
living in the United States.

00:03:43.942 --> 00:03:47.413
This is projected to double by 2030.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.890
As our clients age, they experience

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.798
the normal aging process,
including Alzheimer's disease.

00:03:54.798 --> 00:03:58.016
The Alzheimer's Association is correct

00:03:58.016 --> 00:04:01.110
in reaching out to the IDD community.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.950
We need to be prepared for that,

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.450
and we need knowledge to
serve our community well.

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.440
This is how we've partnered
to serve the IDD community.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.920
These are the project partner roles.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.590
So the Arc San Francisco is working on

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.210
expanding the target audience.

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:24.480
We work with other IDD
vendors in reaching out

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.440
to expand training, and the trainers are

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.810
the Alzheimer's Association staff.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.340
And UCSF provides
evaluations and assessments,

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.963
and DAAS provides
monitoring and reporting.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.480
So the Arc's role in the partnership

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.570
is connecting with the
other IDD organizations

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.403
about the need to increase awareness

00:04:44.403 --> 00:04:49.403
of Alzheimer's and related
dementias in the IDD population.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.520
The Arc San Francisco
is the largest provider

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.840
of IDD services in San Francisco,

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.633
and we work closely with
other organizations.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.800
To work with other IDD organizations,

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.081
to be open to learning about receiving

00:05:04.081 --> 00:05:07.255
cross-disability training as it relates

00:05:07.255 --> 00:05:12.130
to Alzheimer's disease
and related dementias.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.130
And I have to say, the
IDD community's been

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.734
very open about wanting more education

00:05:16.734 --> 00:05:21.010
about Alzheimer's and related dementias.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.774
And we work to educate the
Alzheimer's Association

00:05:23.774 --> 00:05:27.350
on the nuances of
navigating generic supports

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.543
in IDD for better outcomes.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.460
Providing education and advocacy

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.137
to existing resources
about how people with IDD

00:05:38.137 --> 00:05:40.740
and their caregivers are best served.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.890
We have a somewhat complicated system

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:47.030
that is difficult for those
unfamiliar to navigate.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.720
We review this with our partner

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.840
and provide education about this,

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.490
but most importantly,
we open a relationship

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.090
and extend an invitation to ask for help

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.640
when needed from our community.

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:07.810
- So what's the Alzheimer's
role in the partnership?

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.820
First, to inform the
community of IDD vendors

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.770
of the statistics around
Alzheimer's disease

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.320
and related dementias,
particularly the prevalence

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.840
among adults with Down syndrome.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.090
And as you saw in the previous slide,

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.300
we have a large number
of aging individuals

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.800
with IDD coming down the pipeline

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.333
that the IDD community needs
to be better prepared to serve.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.490
Also, the Alzheimer's Association is

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.160
to deliver the trainings to professionals

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.880
and caregivers in the community

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.870
on recognizing signs of dementia,

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.520
needed environmental modifications,
and support strategies.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.110
They're also developing a support model

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.533
for caregivers for us.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.203
So where has this led us?

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.630
Well, it has led us to
belief and understanding

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.160
that the intersection of
our two organizations,

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.630
expertise and knowledge will lead us

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:00.630
to the best outcomes for everyone served

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.470
by the organizations,

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.228
that we need to take a
holistic approach to services,

00:07:05.228 --> 00:07:09.390
and expand one another's knowledge base.

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:12.130
And while the IDD community
is in the best position

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:16.005
to serve individuals with IDD and ADRD,

00:07:16.005 --> 00:07:19.488
our supports need to be
informed by the experts.

00:07:19.488 --> 00:07:21.500
And a good example of the intersection

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.430
of our services or our belief systems

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:25.980
is that both partners really believe

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.270
in the ability of an individual

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.000
to age in place, as long as they have

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.023
the appropriate supports for themselves.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.230
So what we've discovered so far.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.790
Well, it's been an education
process for both parties.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:44.270
And one of the most important
things that we've learned

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.230
is that the existing model
for the ADRD community

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:50.100
and their caregivers does
not seamlessly translate

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.623
to the IDD community and their caregivers.

00:07:54.707 --> 00:07:57.060
There are fundamental differences

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.926
between those providing caregiving

00:07:58.926 --> 00:08:02.803
for those with IDD and those without IDD.

00:08:05.868 --> 00:08:07.773
And so we're going to
look at the differences.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.970
- Okay, so those differences

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:16.172
for the general population
with ADRD is that they have,

00:08:16.172 --> 00:08:19.370
most of the time, live-in caregivers.

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:23.930
In the IDD community,
we have somewhat readily

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:25.640
up to wrap-around services,

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.100
so we have a lot of
people receiving services

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.010
from family home
agencies, board and cares,

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.160
ILS services, independent living skills,

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.170
and supportive living services, SLS.

00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:38.750
In the general population for ADRD,

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.580
there's traditional family relationships.

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.340
For the IDD community,

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:46.440
there's surrogate family relationships.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.320
For the general population for ADRD,

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.650
there's a loss of independence.

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:53.390
For IDD community,
there's transitioning away

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:57.751
from a lifetime of encouraging
independence for people.

00:08:57.751 --> 00:09:00.320
For the general population for ADRD,

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.943
there are new caregivers
for somebody with ADRD.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.233
For the IDD community, there's
a lifetime of caregiving.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.200
For the general population of ADRD,

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.240
their service model is "You come to us".

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.500
And in the service model
for the IDD community,

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.100
we go to you.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:21.870
And then trainings for the
general population with ADRD,

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:24.250
they're designed for large groups.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:25.630
And for the IDD community,

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:27.543
trainings need to be small-scale,

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:32.100
as services are intended
to be individualized

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.650
and we need to reach everybody.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:36.513
We need to reach people in
board and cares, and FHAs.

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:45.340
- So given these differences,
where are we now?

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.580
Well, we realize that
training is critical.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.630
The question is, who needs to be trained?

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.739
We have learned that we cannot
reach traditional caregivers

00:09:54.739 --> 00:09:57.040
in the IDD community if they're not able

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.730
to identify Alzheimer's
disease and related dementia

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:02.703
and lacks awareness of the resources.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.580
We know that professionals
are the gateway to families

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.330
and individuals in need of support.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.324
Paid caregivers are supporting
older adults, many of whom

00:10:13.324 --> 00:10:15.859
have lived in their board
and care homes for decades,

00:10:15.859 --> 00:10:19.460
and have surrogate family
relationships with them.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.450
So where we landed is, we need to adapt

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:23.300
the current support model in order

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.503
to meet the needs of the IDD community.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:34.910
- So what we'd like to present to you now,

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.010
and this is a work in progress,

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:40.760
are some of the adaptations
that will be needed

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:44.620
to make trainings most
relevant to the IDD community.

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.993
The Arc provides a bridge to this as

00:10:46.993 --> 00:10:49.420
sometimes we need to make it easier

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.220
for people to access our information

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.803
as we manage very complicated systems.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:00.780
Not wanting to make people
research two systems themselves,

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:03.400
helping them by building
the information for them

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.700
and bridging the gap for them.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.823
That's the Arc's role in this project.

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:16.510
Most people with IDD parallel
the general population,

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:21.250
with approximately 6% having
some form of dementia.

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:24.500
However, folks with Down
syndrome are a much greater risk

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:28.510
of dementia, due to the
extra 21st chromosome.

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:30.660
It is the 21st chromosome which carries

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.582
the greatest genetic risk factor

00:11:32.582 --> 00:11:36.650
for Alzheimer's disease
in the general population.

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:38.787
Therefore, people with an extra chromosome

00:11:38.787 --> 00:11:40.980
are at an even greater risk.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:44.280
Approximately 50% of
people with Down syndrome

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.830
will develop Alzheimer's
disease by the age of 60.

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:50.480
They also show symptoms
at a much younger age

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.763
when compared to the general population,

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:59.660
with some people experiencing
symptoms in their early 20s.

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:03.233
The earlier the onset, the
faster the progression.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:11.410
- So what is dementia?

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:13.040
Dementia describes a group of symptoms

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:16.660
which can be reversible or progressive.

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:18.870
It is diagnosed by a significant change

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.500
in two of the five categories:

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.203
memory, language, executive function,

00:12:23.203 --> 00:12:25.840
perception, and behavior,

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.080
but it's very important to remember

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.010
that many individuals
in the IDD population

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:32.203
are already impacted in those areas.

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:37.760
Alzheimer's disease is the
most common form of dementia.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.700
It's a progressive,
degenerative, and irreversible

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.090
loss of brain cells and neurotransmitters.

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:45.860
For the general population,
there are standardized tests

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.870
that can inform a diagnosis
of Alzheimer's disease.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:50.740
However, for the IDD population,

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.100
these tests are not as effective.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.280
Persons with IDD must be compared

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.760
against their own baseline, as they start

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.360
at a different capacity
than the general population.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.260
So let's see what that looks like.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:09.500
We often see the 10 warning
signs of Alzheimer's disease,

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.310
and this is from the
Alzheimer's Association.

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:15.680
So, for example, number one,
with the general population,

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.360
it's assumed that most people have

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.820
pretty standard memories,
so you're looking

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.450
for memory loss that disrupts daily life.

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:25.270
In the IDD community, someone
may have poor recall already,

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:27.290
so you're looking at new memory loss

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:29.253
that affects their daily life.

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:31.621
The same thing with number five.

00:13:31.621 --> 00:13:35.760
General population pretty
much has a good grasp

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.390
on visual images and
spatial relationships,

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:40.530
but someone with an IDD may
not, and so you're looking

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:44.053
for new troubles in this area.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.230
So how's a person with IDD diagnosed

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:52.810
with Alzheimer's disease?

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:55.290
Much in the same way as
the general population,

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:57.230
namely, review of medical records,

00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:00.607
interviews with loved
ones, and assessments.

00:14:00.607 --> 00:14:04.480
There are some early
warning signs to look for.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.780
Behavioral changes, such as
getting lost or misdirected,

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.270
being confused in familiar places,

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:12.555
exhibiting new memory problems,

00:14:12.555 --> 00:14:15.200
difficulties with gait and balance,

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:19.470
changes in visual perception,
changes in personality,

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:21.563
and sometimes late-onset seizures.

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:29.210
However, not all changes
indicate the onset of dementia.

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:32.080
Common causes of decline not
due to Alzheimer's disease

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.550
include psychiatric
disorders, sensory impairment,

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:38.820
musculoskeletal problems,
and medical conditions.

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.470
Other health problems that can also mimic

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:44.790
signs of demential include
dehydration, fractures,

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:48.240
urinary tract infections,
adverse drug reactions,

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.640
and dental or mouth pain.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.730
It's important that these
be considered and eliminated

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:55.343
as potential causes of
any observed changes.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.310
- Caregivers also need to be keenly aware

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:04.920
of how the environmental factors

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:08.300
can impact an individual's
level of functioning.

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.813
For example, a change in caregiver,

00:15:10.813 --> 00:15:14.400
a change in staff, change in program,

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:18.600
a move, a new roommate, or
their favorite market closing,

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:22.890
all these can cause a person
to withdraw, become depressed.

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:24.960
Good team communication can alert members

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.070
to changes in their routine

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:30.873
which are causing the
client emotional distress.

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:35.780
So, if the signs are difficult to judge,

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:38.460
how is someone with IDD diagnosed?

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:41.190
The process of making a
diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:44.982
in someone with IDD is the
same as making a diagnosis

00:15:44.982 --> 00:15:48.760
of Alzheimer's disease with anyone else.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.890
Diagnosis is based on a detailed history

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:53.910
of progressive change over time

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:56.870
in thinking, memory, daily living skills,

00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:00.530
a physical examination,
tests of thinking and memory,

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:02.810
and investigations to
rule out other causes

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:04.799
of decline in functioning.

00:16:04.799 --> 00:16:07.163
In order to establish a baseline,

00:16:07.163 --> 00:16:09.580
it is recommended that individuals

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:11.863
with Down syndrome in particular

00:16:11.863 --> 00:16:15.080
have a professional
assessment of communication,

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.650
memory, and other thinking skills,

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:20.500
preferably in their 20s, with a caregiver

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.390
who has known the
individual for many years,

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:26.320
and performed by a
professional with experience

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.860
working with people with Down syndrome.

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:31.630
If a professional
assessment is not possible,

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:34.922
it is helpful to have copies
of educational assessments,

00:16:34.922 --> 00:16:37.070
speech and language assessments,

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:41.340
and psychological evaluations
to establish a baseline.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:44.220
The Arc is looking into assessment tools

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.150
administered with the IDD population,

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.640
and we've done a lot of work
with other organizations

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:52.273
that have worked with other
Alzheimer's organizations.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:01.300
- So, in this partnership thus far,

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.033
here is what we have to offer.

00:17:04.033 --> 00:17:07.410
First, in January 2018, we started

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:10.093
a call-in support group for caregivers.

00:17:10.093 --> 00:17:14.320
It is from 6 to 7 p.m. on the
third Thursday of the month,

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:16.603
so I guess we have had two now.

00:17:17.631 --> 00:17:21.140
We've offered the
Alzheimer's Care Academy,

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.850
and that is a three-hour training

00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:25.470
which provides an overview
of Alzheimer's disease

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:27.980
and how to care for an
individual with dementia.

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.520
To date, we've trained
over 150 professionals

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.500
and direct caregivers, and those include

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.860
day program staff, regional
center case managers,

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:38.713
board and care operators,
FHA administrators.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.200
We also just started offering

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.230
the Adapting to Alzheimer's disease,

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:47.640
and this is a six-hour
training over three weeks

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.360
which provides a more in-depth training

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:50.810
with opportunities to practice

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:54.330
their newly-acquired caregiving
skills in between classes.

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.670
Our first class began on February 16th,

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:58.800
with eight people in attendance.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.530
And it's really the
Alzheimer's Care Academy

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:04.580
and Adapting to Alzheimer's
disease training

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:08.180
which is still evolving,
because what we've found

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:10.180
is that, for the
professionals coming to this

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:12.140
three-hour training, they're wanting more.

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:13.910
It's not meaty enough.

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:17.760
And the Adapting to
Alzheimer's, it needs to be

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.900
more directed towards
the actual caregivers

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.230
that we're seeing now with our population.

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:25.980
It's the paid caregivers,
the surrogate family members,

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.940
it needs to be more modeled to them,

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:31.870
versus a live-in family member.

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:34.170
We're talking about people
who work different shifts,

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:36.050
they're not working with
the person every day.

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:36.890
These are the things we're trying

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:38.170
to incorporate into the training,

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:40.050
so we have something that's more robust

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:43.453
for the professionals and
caregivers for our population.

00:18:44.438 --> 00:18:47.278
We also are offering, in partnership

00:18:47.278 --> 00:18:50.060
with the UCSF Memory and Aging Clinic,

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:52.970
we can make referrals for
evaluations for dementia,

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:55.270
and we've referred three people so far.

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:59.070
And we're also in partnership with them,

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:02.060
hosting them to offer baseline screenings

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:03.633
for individuals in their 20s and 30s

00:19:03.633 --> 00:19:06.705
who are not experiencing
symptoms of dementia,

00:19:06.705 --> 00:19:09.850
but would like to have a formal
record of the adapted skills

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:11.640
for future reference should they arise,

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.570
and that's a voluntary program.

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:16.570
We haven't started it yet, but
that should be starting soon.

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:23.750
So, how do we support
someone with dementia?

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:26.010
There are adaptations to environments

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:27.930
and caregiving styles that can reduce

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:30.640
agitation, wandering, and confusion.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.100
For example, adapting
the caregiver's routine

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:35.773
to allow for more respite
and support staff.

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.800
Also, adapting the client's routine

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.290
to a modified schedule
which reduces opportunities

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:43.393
to wander or become confused.

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:46.980
A big takeaway that I think
a lot of us have gotten

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:49.370
from the training is adapting
one's communication style

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:51.910
to say "yes" to every question,

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:55.470
regardless whether the
request is reasonable or not.

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:57.780
So someone, I think this is a big example

00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:00.050
we see a lot, if someone
you're working with

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:03.945
a 70-year-old individual,
and they want to go

00:20:03.945 --> 00:20:05.630
say "hi" to their grandmother,

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:07.047
go to their grandmother's
house, you just say,

00:20:07.047 --> 00:20:09.537
"Yes, that's great; let's go do it."

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:12.780
Adapting the environment to make it easier

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:14.570
for individuals with dementia to recognize

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:16.709
important rooms, such as the bathroom,

00:20:16.709 --> 00:20:20.143
while eliminating the confusion
of mirrors or shiny floors.

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:27.910
- Okay, resources that are available.

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:31.480
The National Task Group on
Intellectual Disabilities

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.110
and Dementia Practices, the NTG,

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:35.889
is the expert in the subject

00:20:35.889 --> 00:20:38.360
and a rich resource on the topic.

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.620
They offer a number of publications,

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:42.510
training, and resources,

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:45.430
including early detection
screen for dementia.

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:48.050
Many of their resources are free.

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:51.300
The Alzheimer's Association
is another excellent resource

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:54.622
for training and referrals
to programs and services.

00:20:54.622 --> 00:20:57.040
And, of course, the Arc San Francisco

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.410
has a number of services
available for free

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:01.470
to anyone in the Bay Area.

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:04.620
Our call-in support group
is available to anyone,

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:07.053
regardless of their geographic location.

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:10.320
Finally, your client's doctor may be able

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.940
to refer you to a number of resources,

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:15.413
including visiting nurses,
medication, and palliative care.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.250
- And those are just a
few additional resources

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:26.038
where you can find more
information; thank you.

00:21:26.038 --> 00:21:28.288
