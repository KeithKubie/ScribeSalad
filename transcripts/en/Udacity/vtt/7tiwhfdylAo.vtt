00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And here's my code, this implements Bayes rule.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
You take p0 a prior times a probability of seeing a positive test result

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and divided by the sum of the same plus the expression for not having cancer,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
which is the inverse prior and the inverse of this specificity is shown over here.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
When I plug in my reference numbers, the ones from over here, I indeed get 0.33333.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So, this is the correct code and we can plug in our return numbers.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It's fun if we give it a zero probability prior to have cancer

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and guess what, no matter what the test is, you still don't have cancer.

00:00:38.000 --> 99:59:59.000
That's the beauty of Bayes' rule, it takes the prior very seriously.
