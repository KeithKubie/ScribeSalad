00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.709
Hi!

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:09.500
My name is Vaibhav, and today we will learn
about functions.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:16.370
Functions are very important concept, both
for your engineering entrance exams and also

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.680
to understand various concepts in mathematics.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.900
It's a very fundamental concept, and is used
to describe a lot of phenomenon, including

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.400
physical and chemical phenomena.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:38.630
And, also a lot of chapters we will learn
further on such as limits, derivatives, continuity

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:44.760
or be it any other chapter in mathematics,
knowing functions is very important.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.780
It is a very fundamental chapter.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.260
It has various definitions, and so a lot of
use for the next topics that you will learn.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.300
So, we will start with an intuitive definition
of functions.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.949
Something that we will try to understand using
examples, and then we will try to go into

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.980
a more mathematically precise definition.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:20.980
Functions are used to describe, a special
relation

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:28.100
between two variables.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:36.770
So, here the word "relation" is a mathematical
concept that we will understand later; but

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.890
this (functions) is a very intuitive concept.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.039
We have two variables of interest, and we
are trying to define what is the relationship

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:46.039
between them.

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:50.130
And, that is something which is important
in a lot of places, because you always have

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.890
something such as an input to a system and
an output to a system and you want to figure

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.400
out what the system is doing.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.240
Functions come in handy at that place a lot.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.590
This is a very intutitive description of functions.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:13.500
In order to define it for our use, we ... mathematicians
... use different types of descriptors for

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.500
functions.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:37.000
Typically, functions are described using a
graph, a rule or an equation.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:47.400
Now, we will see how this is done.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.530
When you have two variables either you can
drive a graph, a plot OR you can have a very

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.860
intuitive rule which you can easily describe
OR at times as we will see more and more we

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.810
will be using equations to describe a function.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.180
So, let's begin with a very simple example.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:16.770
We will take life of a typical student who
is studying for an exam and going to school.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.900
We want to figure out who his or her day goes.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.020
Let's call the student Sonu, and we want to
find out how Sonu's day went.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:37.010
And, the variable that we are interested in
is "How far Sonu is from home?"

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:44.520
Variable 1 is time.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:04:00.840
Variable 2 will be
Sonu's distance from home.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:08.050
Now, let's go to the first definition that
we wrote.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.099
So, our first description for function is
that function is a "special" relation between

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:14.099
two variables.

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:22.079
And, here what we have are two varibles of
interest - one is "time of the day" and (the

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.980
other is) "how far Sonu is from the home."

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.340
So, let's try to make plot for a typical day.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:37.720
I will try to remember how my school days
were, and try to make a plot based on that.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:56.840
On x-axis I will draw time of day, and on
y-axis I will draw distance from home.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.520
We will try time count from midnight, and
in 24-hour format.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:12.180
A

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.560
day has 24 hours.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.970
And, then we want to figure out how the day
went.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.300
In morning, Sonu was home till 6 o'clock.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:31.900
Then he when to school, so the distance was
how much farther the school was.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.810
He was at school till roughly 2pm, which is
14 hours.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:42.760
Then let's say he goes to a friends place,
and spends some time there.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.400
Then he comes back home, and spends the rest
of the time at home.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.990
So, here we see very intuitively we can describe
the relationship between two variables using

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.570
a plot.

00:05:54.570 --> 00:06:02.030
This plot is essentially describing a function
of where Sonu is throughout the day - how

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.889
far Sonu is from his home - throughout the
day with respect to time of the day.

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:11.550
Similarlt, we can draw such graphs or such
relations for different variables.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:16.250
So, taking an example from physics.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:22.479
Let's say we want to study a similar thing
for an object which is moving with a constant

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:26.180
velocity.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:44.710
So, let's take another example.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:50.140
And if we want to draw a plot of distance
of this object from the starting point it

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.280
will be something very similar to this.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:59.520
The nature of the graph will be different,
but essentially we are plotting similar things.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.770
Variable one will be time.

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:15.710
And, variable two will be distance from start.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:21.180
And (from physics) we know if an object is
moving with a constant velocity ... it can

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.389
be described by an equation.

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:34.110
Let's say we denote the variable two as 'd',
and this is described by 't'.

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:43.259
And let's say that the speed is one which
is given.

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:46.919
This is an example where we described the
function as an equation.

00:07:46.919 --> 00:07:52.490
So, we saw that a function can be described
by a graph, a rule.

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.250
At first the rule was where you are from home.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.190
Or it could be a rule like object moving with
a constant speed.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:00.759
At times we also use equations.

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:02.479
And, they are interchangeable.

00:08:02.479 --> 00:08:09.860
We can write this rule as an equation and
this equation as a graph.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:15.410
This is how distance varies with time.

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:21.199
These are some examples of function, which
occur in day to day activities.

00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:31.210
And in these examples we saw that function's
input was time, but thay doesn't have to be

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:33.149
the case.

00:08:33.149 --> 00:08:39.588
Functions can have different notions of variable
one and variable two depending on the application.

00:08:39.588 --> 00:08:45.910
Another interesting way to look at function
is as an input output relation.

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:54.649
Here, in the examples that we studied we had
two variables.

00:08:54.649 --> 00:09:06.230
We can see them as a relation between input
which goes through the function and out comes

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:08.060
the output.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:23.329
So, in example 1 input was time of day.

00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:29.389
And, output was distance from home.

00:09:29.389 --> 00:09:46.179
Similarly, in example two the input was time
in hours and output was distance from starting

00:09:46.179 --> 00:09:49.410
location.

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:56.420
So, we have seen multiple ways of intuitively
describing a function.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:01.470
Either it could be a special relation between
two variables, it could be described using

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:03.429
a graph, rule or equation ...

00:10:03.429 --> 00:10:10.129
It could be thought of as a system which converts
an input to an output.

00:10:10.129 --> 00:10:16.459
And whenever we have anything of this sort,
we can use functions to describe it.

00:10:16.459 --> 00:10:24.239
Once we have these functions, they are pretty
useful and they can be manipulated to figure

00:10:24.239 --> 00:10:28.029
out to find out properties of a system.

00:10:28.029 --> 00:10:31.410
So far, we have seen a few examples.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:36.720
Now, I would request you to take some time
to think about other functions that you encounter

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.910
in daily life.

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:44.380
For those of who you like sports, you can
think of something in cricket.

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:49.610
Your favorite hits a ball and you want to
figure out how fast the ball is moving.

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:54.319
So, you can have time after which the ball
was hit and the speed of the ball.

00:10:54.319 --> 00:11:00.809
It does not necessarily have to be speed or
time, it can be something all together different.

00:11:00.809 --> 00:11:10.939
Let's say you are going from Bombay to Delhi,
and the number of passangers change at each

00:11:10.939 --> 00:11:11.939
station.

00:11:11.939 --> 00:11:14.589
Based on the distance from Mumbai, you can
figure out the number of passangers in the

00:11:14.589 --> 00:11:17.220
train.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:32.910
In the train example, distance is the input
variable or the variable 1.

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:46.019
And output variable is number of passengers.

00:11:46.019 --> 00:11:54.009
And similarly you can find other functions
in your day to day activities.

00:11:54.009 --> 00:11:59.049
They occur in various physical and chemical
phenomena.

00:11:59.049 --> 00:12:05.790
So, a lot of things that you are learning
in physics and chemistry - functions are also

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:08.860
useful there to describe those phenomena.

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:13.600
Again, take some time to think about examples
of functions.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:22.079
Also, one thing that is important to see here
is what makes variable one go on the x axis

00:12:22.079 --> 00:12:25.009
and variable two on y.

00:12:25.009 --> 00:12:30.829
Is it possible to flip the variables on the
graph?

00:12:30.829 --> 00:12:35.790
Why is variable one on the x axis and variable
two on the y axis?

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:40.819
One reason that you could think of is that
variable one is input and variable two is

00:12:40.819 --> 00:12:46.379
the output; but there are other reasons that
we will see as we go ahead.

00:12:46.379 --> 00:12:53.699
This was a very intuitive definition of function,
now let's study it from a mathemaically precise

00:12:53.699 --> 00:12:55.869
perspective.

00:12:55.869 --> 00:13:01.429
For that we will go back to our orginial statement
- "functions are used to describe special

00:13:01.429 --> 00:13:03.870
relation between two variables.

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:04.870
"

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:09.399
Here we have a few mathematical terms, we
have relations and w have variables.

00:13:09.399 --> 00:13:15.999
We will try to see how they relate to the
mathematical concepts that we already know.

00:13:15.999 --> 00:13:21.379
One thing that we have already learnt is sets.

00:13:21.379 --> 00:13:24.579
Sets are a collection of items.

00:13:24.579 --> 00:13:29.019
So, let's say we have sets A and B.

00:13:29.019 --> 00:13:37.199
A and B could be any sets of objects of interest.

00:13:37.199 --> 00:13:44.279
Let's denote elements of A with small a, and
that of set B with small b.

00:13:44.279 --> 00:13:49.749
Once we have these sets, we have variables
from those sets.

00:13:49.749 --> 00:13:55.180
Whenever there is any relationship between
these variables, we can define them using

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.910
certain mathematical constructs.

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:08.459
One construct is the Cartesian products of
two sets.

00:14:08.459 --> 00:14:19.889
So, a Cartesian products of two sets A, B
is given by A cross B. And, it includes all

00:14:19.889 --> 00:14:21.699
the elements a comma b.

00:14:21.699 --> 00:14:28.540
Let's say A has two variables a1 and a2.

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:33.680
And, set B has one variable b1.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:43.589
Then, A cross B will have two variables (a1,b1)
and (a2,b2)

00:14:43.589 --> 00:14:46.029
(cut near )

00:14:46.029 --> 00:14:53.109
But, if set B had another variable b2.

00:14:53.109 --> 00:15:01.310
Then the total variables will be four.

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:06.629
Cartesian products of two sets includes number
of elements of set A multiplied by number

00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:08.610
of elements of set B. T

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:17.490
This is a very big set, and a Relation is
defined as a subset of the Cartesian product.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:23.759
So, let's say for some reason you are only
interested in the subset of the Cartesian

00:15:23.759 --> 00:15:24.759
product set.

00:15:24.759 --> 00:15:33.299
We call it by R.

00:15:33.299 --> 00:15:43.269
R let's say has (a1, b1) and (a2, b2).

00:15:43.269 --> 00:15:47.329
Any subset of the cartesian product is a relation.

00:15:47.329 --> 00:16:00.959
Now, that we
have defined the important concepts that we

00:16:00.959 --> 00:16:07.499
need for the precise defintion of fucntions,...
we will see in the next lecture how we combine

00:16:07.499 --> 00:16:13.489
sets, cartesian products and relations - specifically
relations to figure out what is special about

00:16:13.489 --> 00:16:14.609
functions.
