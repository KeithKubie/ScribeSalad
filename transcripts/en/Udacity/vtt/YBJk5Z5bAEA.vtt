[Evans] We're only going to have 1 quiz in this unit,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and the quiz is something that should sound like a fairly simple question,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
although it's actually quite difficult to answer.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The question is, what kind of thing is computer science?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Your choices are engineering, science, and liberal art.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Check as many as you want.
