00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:02.134
[SOUND].

00:00:02.134 --> 00:00:02.950
&gt;&gt; Whoa.

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.248
&gt;&gt; That is the sound of great design.

00:00:05.248 --> 00:00:08.291
That sound was made possible by electrical engineers,

00:00:08.291 --> 00:00:11.658
mechanical engineers, and even audio engineers, that came

00:00:11.658 --> 00:00:14.386
together to engineer the perfect sound of speed.

00:00:14.386 --> 00:00:15.470
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:16.140
&gt;&gt; But that's not all.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.220
&gt;&gt; Whoa.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.088
&gt;&gt; want to take it for a spin?

00:00:19.088 --> 00:00:24.247
&gt;&gt; Yes. [SOUND] This

00:00:24.247 --> 00:00:30.014
is user experience.

00:00:30.014 --> 00:00:39.280
