00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.643
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.643 --> 00:00:06.220
is tackle some word
problems involving ratios.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.675
So here, we're told that Yoda Soda

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:10.833
is the intergalactic party drink

00:00:10.833 --> 00:00:15.561
that will have all of your
friends saying, mm, good this is.

00:00:15.561 --> 00:00:17.185
You are throwing a party

00:00:17.185 --> 00:00:21.352
and you need five liters of
Yoda Soda for every 12 guests.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.236
If you have 36 guests,

00:00:25.236 --> 00:00:29.155
how many liters of Yoda Soda do you need?

00:00:29.155 --> 00:00:33.108
So pause this video and try
to figure it out on your own.

00:00:33.108 --> 00:00:36.525
Well, they tell us the
ratio of liters of soda

00:00:36.525 --> 00:00:38.398
to number of guests.

00:00:38.398 --> 00:00:41.935
So you need five, it's five liters

00:00:41.935 --> 00:00:44.602
for every 12 guests is the ratio

00:00:45.528 --> 00:00:47.935
but we wanna have 36 guests.

00:00:47.935 --> 00:00:52.505
So if the ratio is five liters
of soda for every 12 guests

00:00:52.505 --> 00:00:55.321
but we're in a situation
where we have 36 guests,

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:57.928
so this is three times as many guests,

00:00:57.928 --> 00:01:02.249
we're gonna need three times
as many liters of soda.

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:05.058
So three times five is 15.

00:01:05.058 --> 00:01:06.563
Five to 12.

00:01:06.563 --> 00:01:08.190
Five liters for 12 guests

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.393
or for five liters for every 12 guests

00:01:10.393 --> 00:01:14.018
is the same thing as 15
liters for every 36 guests.

00:01:14.018 --> 00:01:15.035
So to answer that question,

00:01:15.035 --> 00:01:16.717
how many liters do you need,

00:01:16.717 --> 00:01:18.300
you need 15 liters.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.660
Let's do another one of these.

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:25.693
Here, we just have a picture

00:01:25.693 --> 00:01:27.484
of a bunch of fish in a tank

00:01:27.484 --> 00:01:29.482
and it says there are eight big fish

00:01:29.482 --> 00:01:32.142
for every blank small fish

00:01:32.142 --> 00:01:33.607
and then it says there are four big fish

00:01:33.607 --> 00:01:35.808
for every blank small fish.

00:01:35.808 --> 00:01:36.990
So pause this video again

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.683
and see if you can work through this.

00:01:39.683 --> 00:01:43.233
Alright, so let's just
count the big fish first.

00:01:43.233 --> 00:01:45.397
So there's one, two, three,

00:01:45.397 --> 00:01:46.376
wait, let me count this way.

00:01:46.376 --> 00:01:49.306
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

00:01:49.306 --> 00:01:52.282
So in this tank, there
actually are eight big fish

00:01:52.282 --> 00:01:53.998
and so let's see how many
small fish there are.

00:01:53.998 --> 00:01:56.569
There's one, two, three, four, five,

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:59.819
six, seven, eight, nine, 10 small fish.

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.164
So in the tank, for every eight big fish

00:02:03.164 --> 00:02:06.345
which you see in red,
there are 10 small fish

00:02:06.345 --> 00:02:08.955
but here it says, there are four big fish

00:02:08.955 --> 00:02:10.622
for every blank small fish.

00:02:10.622 --> 00:02:12.223
So what would that be?

00:02:12.223 --> 00:02:13.389
Well, one way to think about it

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:15.722
is we have half as many fish

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.931
or half as many big fish
so we divided it by two.

00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:22.536
So we're gonna have
half as many small fish.

00:02:22.536 --> 00:02:24.042
So we're gonna divide by two.

00:02:24.042 --> 00:02:28.357
So for every four big fish,
there are five small fish

00:02:28.357 --> 00:02:29.254
and one way to think about it,

00:02:29.254 --> 00:02:31.338
you could divide the fish evenly

00:02:31.338 --> 00:02:33.334
into two groups right over here.

00:02:33.334 --> 00:02:35.456
So let's see, if we can capture,

00:02:35.456 --> 00:02:37.956
so if you could have, this is,

00:02:39.453 --> 00:02:40.798
if I divide it like that,

00:02:40.798 --> 00:02:45.071
here I have one, two, three, four big fish

00:02:45.071 --> 00:02:48.170
and one, two, three, four, five small fish

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.557
then in this group I have
one, two, three, four big fish

00:02:51.557 --> 00:02:54.706
and one, two, three,
four, five small fish.

00:02:54.706 --> 00:02:58.296
So every four big fish,
there are five small fish.

00:02:58.296 --> 00:03:00.459
These are equivalent ratios.

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:01.876
Let's keep going.

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:07.433
So here, we're told an ice cream shop

00:03:07.433 --> 00:03:11.143
uses the following ingredients
to make one sundae.

00:03:11.143 --> 00:03:13.101
So they use two scoops of ice cream,

00:03:13.101 --> 00:03:15.461
four spoonfuls of sprinkles,

00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:17.909
two tablespoons of whipped cream.

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.111
How many sundaes did the shop make

00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:23.361
if they used 32 spoonfuls of sprinkles?

00:03:25.286 --> 00:03:28.793
So pause the video and
try to think about it.

00:03:28.793 --> 00:03:31.205
So there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:03:31.205 --> 00:03:34.059
Here, it says, let's see,
we're talking about sprinkles.

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:35.608
So that's what's relevant here.

00:03:35.608 --> 00:03:38.752
Four spoonfuls for every one sundae.

00:03:38.752 --> 00:03:40.229
So we could say that there,

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:45.076
so the ratio of spoonfuls
to sundaes is four to one.

00:03:45.076 --> 00:03:48.326
Four spoonfuls, spoonfuls of sprinkles,

00:03:50.325 --> 00:03:51.208
let me write it this way,

00:03:51.208 --> 00:03:54.335
let me write sprinkles, sprinkles.

00:03:54.335 --> 00:03:56.241
How many spoonfuls?

00:03:56.241 --> 00:03:59.074
How many spoonfuls for one sundae?

00:04:01.634 --> 00:04:05.908
But here we're talking about
using 32 spoonfuls of sprinkles

00:04:05.908 --> 00:04:08.146
so that is eight times as many.

00:04:08.146 --> 00:04:09.941
So you're going to be able to use,

00:04:09.941 --> 00:04:12.633
create eight times as many sundaes.

00:04:12.633 --> 00:04:15.435
So you're gonna have 32
spoonfuls of sprinkles

00:04:15.435 --> 00:04:17.656
for every eight sundaes.

00:04:17.656 --> 00:04:19.486
So how many sundaes did the shop make?

00:04:19.486 --> 00:04:21.530
Well, they made eight.

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.697
Let's do one last example.

00:04:26.261 --> 00:04:29.239
At a dog park, there are 10 black dogs,

00:04:29.239 --> 00:04:33.406
five brown dogs, two white
dogs and 12 multi-color dogs.

00:04:35.563 --> 00:04:39.730
For every one brown dog,
there are two blank dogs.

00:04:41.105 --> 00:04:44.614
Pause the video and figure
out what goes in this blank.

00:04:44.614 --> 00:04:46.248
Alright, so let's see.

00:04:46.248 --> 00:04:50.286
There's five brown dogs
for every 10 black dogs,

00:04:50.286 --> 00:04:53.020
five brown dogs for every two white dogs

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.672
and five brown dogs for
every 12 multi-color dogs

00:04:57.672 --> 00:04:59.747
but here you're saying
for every one brown dog,

00:04:59.747 --> 00:05:02.518
there are two blank dogs.

00:05:02.518 --> 00:05:05.210
So what type of dog is there a ratio?

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.431
So for every brown dog,

00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:09.450
there's twice as many of that type of dog.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.784
Well, here, we see for
every five brown dogs,

00:05:13.784 --> 00:05:15.784
there are 10 black dogs.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:17.867
So one way to think about it,

00:05:17.867 --> 00:05:19.213
the number of black dogs

00:05:19.213 --> 00:05:22.470
is always gonna be twice
the number of brown dogs.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.023
So for every one brown dog,

00:05:24.023 --> 00:05:27.856
there would be two, two
black, two black dogs.

00:05:29.973 --> 00:05:30.951
One way to think about it,

00:05:30.951 --> 00:05:33.934
the ratio between brown
dogs and black dogs

00:05:33.934 --> 00:05:35.235
and it's kinda counterintuitive.

00:05:35.235 --> 00:05:36.212
I used the wrong colors here.

00:05:36.212 --> 00:05:37.801
I should have used brown and black.

00:05:37.801 --> 00:05:39.023
So let me do that.

00:05:39.023 --> 00:05:41.178
So the ratio of brown to black

00:05:41.178 --> 00:05:45.011
is five brown dogs for
every 10, 10 black dogs

00:05:47.201 --> 00:05:50.382
or if you divide both of
these numbers by five,

00:05:50.382 --> 00:05:53.049
you would get one, one brown dog

00:05:54.256 --> 00:05:58.335
for every two, for every two black dogs

00:05:58.335 --> 00:06:01.670
and that's exactly what
this statement is saying.
