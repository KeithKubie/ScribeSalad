00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:19.360
Now for this next one I am going to need a
volunteer. Now this is a glass of my finest

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:27.739
urine. I need a volunteer to drink this
urine.

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:29.180
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.820
OK. OK. Listen. When someone says, I need
a volunteer to drink urine, you do not volunteer

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.980
for that. OK? That's the most important lesson
I'm going to give you today.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.510
There are hands is still up.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.130
Really it is not socially acceptable ever,
ever to drink urine. OK?

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.230
There's a reason you have kidneys.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.460
And that's because the stuff in your urine,
the stuff that your kidneys takes out,

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.620
the potassium, the sodium, that urea, the creatinine,
the phosphates. That 5% of the urine is really,

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.280
really bad stuff, which is why put it on the
outside of you. OK?

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.759
So when someone says, do you want to drink
my urine? You say, no.

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.759
There is only one acceptable way to drink
urine.

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:17.560
And that is if you have some special treatment.
OK?

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.329
This is a special bag that recycles urine.

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:27.439
It's a bag within a bag. And I think I'm
probably going to need another glass here.

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:37.319
But there's a bag within a bag. And the bag
inside is actually a semi-permeable membrane.

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:42.159
You pee into this red port here. The urine
goes into the bag. And then the bag on the

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.359
inside will allow water to go through, but
not all the nasty stuff.

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:51.899
Now to encourage the water across, this green
port you put a syrup in.

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:58.840
And the syrup has a very high osmotic pressure,
lots of molecules that draw the water across.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.039
And you get clean water with all the nasty
stuff left outside. This, very helpfully,

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:08.270
if you can see that there, has a port that
says dirty water in.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.950
Sports syrup in, clean drink out.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.670
So do not drink out of the red port.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.390
This is one I made earlier because osmosis
takes a while.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.760
We're going to pour in here now.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.360
Now here's the thing, because you've got some
syrup in there, it kind of looks a little

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.920
bit like pee even after it's been reprocessed.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:39.409
And to be honest... do you want to have a
smell of that? It smells like...

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:41.590
Smells quite a lot like urine.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.920
Yeah. So it smells quite a lot like pee. Do
you want to smell?

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.310
So it looks a bit like pee. And it still smells
a bit like pee.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:03:00.719
But this is perfectly safe to drink now because
osmosis has treated it. And...

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:06.529
To be honest, it really does still taste like
pee. All right.
