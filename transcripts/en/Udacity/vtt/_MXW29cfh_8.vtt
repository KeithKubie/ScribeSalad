00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.800
Here we're looking at

00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.730
a visualization about drone strikes from pitch interactive.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.820
As we enter the visualization, we're taken through an author driven

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.030
narrative step by step with the accompanying drone strike animation.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.918
This is the narrow stem of the martini glass.

00:00:18.316 --> 00:00:22.350
As we click through, the final visualization starts to build.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.040
Each element fades in slowly,

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.250
with annotations about notable events during that period.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.530
Notice that up until now, it's been linear, with a single path.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.205
We're still on the stem of the martini glass.

00:00:37.248 --> 00:00:39.344
After the visualization is finished building,

00:00:39.344 --> 00:00:42.460
we're invited to look into the data more closely.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.320
We're now in the wide mouth of the glass, and

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.260
it's become a viewer-driven narrative, instead of an author-driven one.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.963
I can mouse over specific data points, and

00:00:49.963 --> 00:00:52.625
a tooltip appears, allowing me to dig into the data more closely.

00:00:55.717 --> 00:00:59.487
I can also click on the tabs in the upper left to pivot the data and

00:00:59.487 --> 00:01:00.990
look at it in other ways.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.739
Recent news about drone strikes is included below,

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.840
keeping the visualization relevant and current.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.230
Hopefully, you can see how this particular visualization combines with

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.110
the author-driven and viewer-driven elements to make a compelling narrative.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.810
Let's look at one more.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.120
In this example,

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.380
Parascopic shows us a visualization of the number of gun-related deaths in 2013.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.960
It starts with a few victims and

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.680
projects out the number of years they would have lived without gun violence.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.590
It keeps a running tally, and the visualization builds exponentially.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.270
Similar to the previous example, there's a clear narrative as we enter

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.420
the visualization, and then we're invited to apply various FilterSense data.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.310
For example, I wanted to look at males that are over 30 in the Southeast.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.976
I can either look at their projections here, or look at a graph.

00:01:56.129 --> 00:02:00.014
Also included is two major insights, that the majority of victims are men and

00:02:00.014 --> 00:02:03.080
boys, and that the young people are a significant portion.
