that society for the first time in his
 

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.580
that society for the first time in his
history has the ability to commit

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:17.590
history has the ability to commit
 

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.490
history has the ability to commit
planetary suicide so maybe that's the

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:20.500
planetary suicide so maybe that's the
 

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.800
planetary suicide so maybe that's the
reason why we don't see aliens in outer

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:22.810
reason why we don't see aliens in outer
 

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:25.860
reason why we don't see aliens in outer
space maybe they never made it maybe one

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:25.870
space maybe they never made it maybe one
 

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.480
space maybe they never made it maybe one
day when we have starships and visit

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:27.490
day when we have starships and visit
 

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:29.670
day when we have starships and visit
them we'll see atmospheres that are

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:29.680
them we'll see atmospheres that are
 

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.200
them we'll see atmospheres that are
irradiated because they had a nuclear

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:31.210
irradiated because they had a nuclear
 

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:33.840
irradiated because they had a nuclear
war atmosphere is too hot to sustain

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:33.850
war atmosphere is too hot to sustain
 

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:34.980
war atmosphere is too hot to sustain
life because they had a runaway

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:34.990
life because they had a runaway
 

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:37.650
life because they had a runaway
greenhouse effect maybe when we go in

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:37.660
greenhouse effect maybe when we go in
 

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.780
greenhouse effect maybe when we go in
out of space we'll see the corpses of

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:39.790
out of space we'll see the corpses of
 

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:42.720
out of space we'll see the corpses of
type 1 civilizations that never quite

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:42.730
type 1 civilizations that never quite
 

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:46.350
type 1 civilizations that never quite
made it who knows
