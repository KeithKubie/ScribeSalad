 Douglas: My name is Anthony Douglas, Founder and CEO of Hole19. 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.640
 [Rock music exhilarating] 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.040
 Seeking Hole19 to design 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.040
 The largest network of golfers gather and interact with them. 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.560
 We aim to provide a link between golfers around the world. 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.200
 We try to participate in the golfers' trip 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.040
 Before, during and after the game. 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.560

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.280
 Golf has always been a source of passion for me. 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.880
 I started the idea in 2007 when I was working with a golf instructor. 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.840
 I took advantage of them to follow up on me statistics and communicate with the coach 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.440
 To help me improve my skills. 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.080
 I decided to create a new company in this field. 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.360
 It was a great way to combine my passion and my work. 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.720
 [Rock music exhilarating] 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.320
 We designed the product in Portugal. 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.880
 In Lisbon specifically. 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.000
 KUNA team of designers to help us design. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.320
 Four and a half to five years later, the number of users was approximately 1 million. 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.240
 The moment we discovered Android Wear, we realized that it was our only tool 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.960
 To achieve what we aspire to. 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.160
 Not much like golfers 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.840
 Consider the phone a lot, 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.520
 That's what made us think about using smart clock. 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.480
 Given the hardware and software components, we realized that Android Wear was the perfect solution 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.920
 For us. 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.280
 Carpalho: Since the launch of Wear, we have noticed a great welcome from users 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.880
 And positive comments, this helped us 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.320
 In access to a broader base of users exceed twice the users six months ago. 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.520
 We noticed that the monthly activity rate 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.840
 Android Wear users reached 40%. 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.760
 Android Wear provides us with a more interactive forum. 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.400
 In fact, some users only benefit from Hole19 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.360
 On Android Wear. 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.560
 We believe that this is the result of the great efforts we have made 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.040
 In development. 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.720
 As a developer I was switching to Android Wear 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.680
 It is fairly easy, given the quality of wearable devices. 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.440
 One of the most important experiences in the golf course is the possibility 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.920
 Know the distance and wind speed. 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.920
 It's a feature that makes switching from phone to clock 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.000
 Is very useful. 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.920
 There is an important thing to consider when developing applications 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.400
 For use in Wear, a connection must always be available 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.760
 Between phone and application. 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.240
 Therefore, we used the Data Layer API 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.600
 Which provided us with the ease of doing so, 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.400
 This is due to the dependence on 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.360
 Exchange simple and appropriate data. 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.960
 After launching the new Android Wear 2.0 release, 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.640
 We have access to a wide range of features 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.360
 Which can give a better user experience. 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.000
 We use API Complications, 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.200
 Since we want the user to feel in constant contact with Hole19. 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.280
 We want him to know just by looking at the background of the hour's quick information 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.280
 Such as information on disability rate, average outcome, 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.480
 The number of days passed on 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.320
 Another golf match. 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.200
 - The moment of founding of the company was a wonderful moment, 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.920
 When I spent six hours 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.480
 In the planning of golf courses. 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.200
 My information was limited, but after a few years, 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.960
 1 million users. 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.360
 I did not expect such success, 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.840
 I did not expect to join 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.560
 30 people to our company. 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.520
 Our efforts have been very successful.
