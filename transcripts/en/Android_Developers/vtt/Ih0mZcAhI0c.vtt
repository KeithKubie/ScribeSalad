MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Hi, and
welcome to this video, where

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.640
we will show you all the new,
exciting stuff in Google Play

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.540
Services 4.3.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.400
If you're new to
Google Play Services,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.690
you have come to the right place
because Google Play Services

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.030
rocks.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.650
For you as a developer,
this is great news

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.160
because you can get your
hands of all the latest

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.010
blazing, hot stuff we
develop here at Google.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.430
And incorporate into your apps.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.860
Let's look at the
highlights of this version.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.110
First of all, we'll show
you a brand new Address API,

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.560
then we'll go through
some exciting new features

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.740
of the Google Play
Games services.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.740
We'll also cover the Google
Analytics and Google Tag

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.050
Manager APIs, which are also
brand new to the Google Play

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.390
Services family.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.910
And we'll round it off
this time by showing you

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.970
new stuff in the Google
Drive Android API.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:50.780
Let's get started.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.320
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.020
Ladies and gentlemen, that's
right, we've got a new API.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.775
Let's welcome the Address
API with a round of applause.

00:01:00.775 --> 00:01:02.150
MALE SPEAKER 1:
Get back to work.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.090
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yes sir.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.560
How many of you have
tried to buy something

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.420
on the internet
from your smartphone

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.990
and then come to
the part where you

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.310
need to fill out the
delivery address.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.880
Argh, nightmare experience.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.580
Big fingers on small keys.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.660
But of course, if you want to
ship to your current location,

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.590
then you can use
the location API

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.840
to fill out the address,
which makes things easier.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.590
MALE SPEAKER 2: But
what if you're at work

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.481
and want to ship
it to your home?

00:01:29.481 --> 00:01:30.980
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
That's exactly when

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.390
the Address API
comes to the rescue.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.380
With the API, your app can
present a user interface,

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.870
which displays all addresses
registered by the user.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.760
The user can then
select an address,

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.620
such as John Smith in the
example on the picture,

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.900
and voila.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.080
The address will be made
available to the awesome bike

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.620
store app to complete
the purchase.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.780
There is no more messing around
with thumbs and small keys.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.370
Isn't that great?

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.930
Shopping on your smartphone
just became a walk in the park,

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.220
thanks to Google Play Services.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.030
Now over to Google
Play Game services,

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.199
mobile gaming is
bigger than ever

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:12.170
and we're continuing to pack
new features into this API.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.820
With this release we've
introduced Game Gifts,

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.230
which allows player to send
virtual in-game requests

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.350
to anyone in their Google+
Circles or through player

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.350
search.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.130
A player can now
send a Wish Request

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.700
to ask another player for
an in-game benefit or item.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.530
And another player can
send a Gift Request

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.920
to give an item, or
benefit, or something,

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.690
making both players
happy in the end.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.700
This feature complements the
multi-player functionality

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.000
released earlier and will
enhance the social engagement

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.200
between players in your games.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.400
An example of using gifts
is to request more lives

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.630
from your friend, in case
the last round of playing

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.385
did not go so well.

00:02:55.385 --> 00:02:56.255
Psst.

00:02:56.255 --> 00:02:59.460
This little video used the
LiquidFun Physics Engine.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.130
You should so much check it out.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.140
So great stuff from the
Google Play Services,

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.120
be sure to use them
all in your game.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.010
Let's now move over to the
Google Analytics and Google Tag

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.845
Manager APIs.

00:03:11.845 --> 00:03:12.470
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.490
And ladies and gentlemen, that's
right, these are all new APIs.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.520
Let's welcome the Google
Analytics and Google Tag

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.535
Manager APIs with a
round of applause.

00:03:24.535 --> 00:03:25.910
MALE SPEAKER 1:
Get back to work.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.530
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yes, sir.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.360
So these APIs have actually
existed as standalone APIs,

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.350
but have now been fully
integrated into the Google Play

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.310
Services API family.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.370
This is great, since this
reduces the memory footprint

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.350
of your app, and these APIs
become accessible side by side,

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.610
with all the other
ones, ready for you

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.760
to use to create that shiny app.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.260
So let's look at what
these APIs contain.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.120
We'll start off with the
Google Tag Manager, which

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.630
lets you use tags in your apps
instead of hard-coding values.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.260
These tags are then
substituted for values

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.300
that you have stored in the
Tag Manager at run time.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.160
This can, for example, be used
to manage background colors

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.480
of your app, game settings,
and localization settings.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.810
Since the values of the tags
are stored in the Tag Manager,

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.510
this eliminates the need
to push your entire app

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.880
from Google Play again.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.160
You can simply change the value
of the tag in the Google Tag

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.060
Manager.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.510
That brings us over to
the Google Analytics API.

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.930
And if you haven't used
Google Analytics before,

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.960
I strongly encourage you
to take it for test ride.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.690
Google Analytics allows you
to get detailed statistics

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.240
on how your app is being
used by your users.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.560
For example what
functionality of your app

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.480
is being used the most or
which activity triggers

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.720
the users to convert from
an advertisements app

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.700
to a paid one.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.940
So that stuff can be
pretty, pretty good

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.730
to know to get your
users happy, but also

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.320
to get your next
month's paycheck.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.450
So be sure to check the
Google Analytics API out

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.550
because it can really provide
lots of valuable information

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:05.090
to you.

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.830
Which brings us to do
Google Drive Android API.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.450
As you may know, Google
Drive Android API

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.340
was officially released in the
last version of Google Play

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.210
services, and it's
often a flying start

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.740
with a number of
API enhancements.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.230
First off is pinning.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.000
You can now pin
files that should

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.760
be kept up to date locally.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.190
This ensures that the app
can work with these files,

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.860
even when the user is offline.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.120
Then we have app folders
which allows your app

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.590
to create files which are no
longer visible to the user.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.110
For example, to store temporary
files in a photo editor,

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.860
this is the same function
as the application data

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.700
folder in the Google Drive API
that have existed for a while.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.090
With this version, we also
have Change Notifications,

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.750
which makes it possible
to register a call back,

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.970
and receive a notification when
a file or folder is changed.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.000
This means that
you no longer need

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.060
to query drive continuously to
check if the data has changed,

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.160
just put the Change
Notification on it

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.910
and the API will call
you when it happens.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.190
And then we've also made
a number of enhancements

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.480
to metadata information,
which is something

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.600
you can never get enough of.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.020
Well, to satisfy that craving,
you may have for metadata,

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.010
you should be happy
to hear that we've

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.470
added a bunch of new
fields in this version.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.130
So that's it for this release
of Google Play Services,

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.480
but stay tuned because we've
got lots more coming up.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.430
Now it's your turn.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.650
So go out there and
create great apps,

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.540
and don't forget to
tell us all about it.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.705
[BIKE BELL]
