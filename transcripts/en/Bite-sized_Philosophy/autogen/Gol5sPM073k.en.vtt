very very powerfully like all

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360
very very powerfully like all
 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.799
very very powerfully like all
psychedelics do and it transports them

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809
psychedelics do and it transports them
 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.420
psychedelics do and it transports them
to another world and that's how they

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430
to another world and that's how they
 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.470
to another world and that's how they
interpret it and and and and what we

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480
interpret it and and and and what we
 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.090
interpret it and and and and what we
know about psychedelics you could put in

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100
know about psychedelics you could put in
 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.469
know about psychedelics you could put in
a thimble and then throw the thimble

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479
a thimble and then throw the thimble
 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.929
a thimble and then throw the thimble
away we know nothing about psychedelics

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939
away we know nothing about psychedelics
 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.330
away we know nothing about psychedelics
there's new experiments going on at

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340
there's new experiments going on at
 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.219
there's new experiments going on at
Johns Hopkins for example with

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229
Johns Hopkins for example with
 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.770
Johns Hopkins for example with
psilocybin which is part of this active

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780
psilocybin which is part of this active
 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.630
psilocybin which is part of this active
chemical in magic mushrooms same

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640
chemical in magic mushrooms same
 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.730
chemical in magic mushrooms same
structure basically as LSD and mescaline

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740
structure basically as LSD and mescaline
 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.260
structure basically as LSD and mescaline
and all the real psychedelics have

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270
and all the real psychedelics have
 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.510
and all the real psychedelics have
basically the same structure except the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520
basically the same structure except the
 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.370
basically the same structure except the
one that's derived from Amanita muscaria

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380
one that's derived from Amanita muscaria
 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.410
one that's derived from Amanita muscaria
which is called muscarinic acid and it's

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420
which is called muscarinic acid and it's
 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.480
which is called muscarinic acid and it's
a it's its own weird thing that no one

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490
a it's its own weird thing that no one
 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.609
a it's its own weird thing that no one
knows anything about anyways they have

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619
knows anything about anyways they have
 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.440
knows anything about anyways they have
profound neuro chemical effects in very

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450
profound neuro chemical effects in very
 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.010
profound neuro chemical effects in very
small doses and the research group at

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020
small doses and the research group at
 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.440
small doses and the research group at
Johns Hopkins has given psilocybin to

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450
Johns Hopkins has given psilocybin to
 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.240
Johns Hopkins has given psilocybin to
research subjects you know purified

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250
research subjects you know purified
 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.130
research subjects you know purified
psilocybin because they started the new

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140
psilocybin because they started the new
 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.350
psilocybin because they started the new
experimentation with psychedelics and

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360
experimentation with psychedelics and
 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.120
experimentation with psychedelics and
that's been banned for like 40 years

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130
that's been banned for like 40 years
 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.280
that's been banned for like 40 years
because psychedelics were so terrifying

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290
because psychedelics were so terrifying
 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.810
because psychedelics were so terrifying
to our culture that we just put them

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820
to our culture that we just put them
 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.789
to our culture that we just put them
away it's like oh no we're not going

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799
away it's like oh no we're not going
 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.190
away it's like oh no we're not going
there and so even from a research

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200
there and so even from a research
 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.319
there and so even from a research
perspective and even though some of the

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329
perspective and even though some of the
 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.149
perspective and even though some of the
psychedelics look very promising for the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159
psychedelics look very promising for the
 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.950
psychedelics look very promising for the
treatment of disorders like alcoholism

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960
treatment of disorders like alcoholism
 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.319
treatment of disorders like alcoholism
they recently used psilocybin to help

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329
they recently used psilocybin to help
 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.880
they recently used psilocybin to help
people stop smoking down at Johns

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890
people stop smoking down at Johns
 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.319
people stop smoking down at Johns
Hopkins and I think they had an 80%

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329
Hopkins and I think they had an 80%
 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.080
Hopkins and I think they had an 80%
success rate which is just like that's

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090
success rate which is just like that's
 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.760
success rate which is just like that's
just absolutely mind-boggling

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770
just absolutely mind-boggling
 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.010
just absolutely mind-boggling
and so but if you give people psilocybin

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020
and so but if you give people psilocybin
 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.760
and so but if you give people psilocybin
and they haven't

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770
and they haven't
 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.950
and they haven't
mystical experience which is very common

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960
mystical experience which is very common
 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.600
mystical experience which is very common
among people who take these sorts of

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610
among people who take these sorts of
 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.090
among people who take these sorts of
chemicals then their personality

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100
chemicals then their personality
 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.850
chemicals then their personality
transforms permanently such that one

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860
transforms permanently such that one
 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.710
transforms permanently such that one
year later their one standard deviation

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720
year later their one standard deviation
 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.410
year later their one standard deviation
higher in openness and openness is the

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420
higher in openness and openness is the
 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.660
higher in openness and openness is the
creativity dimension and that seems to

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670
creativity dimension and that seems to
 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.580
creativity dimension and that seems to
be a permanent transformation so that's

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590
be a permanent transformation so that's
 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.070
be a permanent transformation so that's
really remarkable and about 80% of the

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080
really remarkable and about 80% of the
 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.610
really remarkable and about 80% of the
people who undergo the Johns Hopkins

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620
people who undergo the Johns Hopkins
 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.870
people who undergo the Johns Hopkins
experiments report that the experience

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880
experiments report that the experience
 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.400
experiments report that the experience
is like one of the two or three most

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410
is like one of the two or three most
 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.500
is like one of the two or three most
important things they've ever that's

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510
important things they've ever that's
 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.380
important things they've ever that's
never ever happened to them and so well

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390
never ever happened to them and so well
 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.270
never ever happened to them and so well
that's that's something you know it's

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280
that's that's something you know it's
 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.280
that's that's something you know it's
like and then there's this guy named

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290
like and then there's this guy named
 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.320
like and then there's this guy named
Rick Strassman down at I think he was at

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330
Rick Strassman down at I think he was at
 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.120
Rick Strassman down at I think he was at
the University of Texas and he did

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130
the University of Texas and he did
 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.760
the University of Texas and he did
experimentation with DMT and DMT

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770
experimentation with DMT and DMT
 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.100
experimentation with DMT and DMT
dimethyltryptamine I remember I remember

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110
dimethyltryptamine I remember I remember
 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.500
dimethyltryptamine I remember I remember
correctly is the active ingredient in

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510
correctly is the active ingredient in
 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.270
correctly is the active ingredient in
ayahuasca and you produce it in your

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280
ayahuasca and you produce it in your
 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.190
ayahuasca and you produce it in your
brain and it's in plants it's like a

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200
brain and it's in plants it's like a
 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.270
brain and it's in plants it's like a
very common chemical but DMT is a weird

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280
very common chemical but DMT is a weird
 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.930
very common chemical but DMT is a weird
hallucinogen because it has an

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940
hallucinogen because it has an
 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.910
hallucinogen because it has an
extraordinarily short mechanism of

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920
extraordinarily short mechanism of
 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.190
extraordinarily short mechanism of
action it's like and people who take it

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200
action it's like and people who take it
 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.710
action it's like and people who take it
report that they're blasted out of their

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720
report that they're blasted out of their
 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.410
report that they're blasted out of their
body like out of a cannon and then they

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420
body like out of a cannon and then they
 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.500
body like out of a cannon and then they
go out somewhere and encounter beings of

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510
go out somewhere and encounter beings of
 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.440
go out somewhere and encounter beings of
various sorts and then ten minutes later

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450
various sorts and then ten minutes later
 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.180
various sorts and then ten minutes later
they're back and virtually everyone

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190
they're back and virtually everyone
 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.220
they're back and virtually everyone
reports that which is really strange and

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230
reports that which is really strange and
 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.910
reports that which is really strange and
so strassman was giving people DMT

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920
so strassman was giving people DMT
 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.710
so strassman was giving people DMT
intravenously so that the trip would

was a pretty straight scientist you know

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650
was a pretty straight scientist you know
 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.199
was a pretty straight scientist you know
he was measuring heart rate and pulse

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209
he was measuring heart rate and pulse
 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.060
he was measuring heart rate and pulse
and all that sort of thing trying to

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070
and all that sort of thing trying to
 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.040
and all that sort of thing trying to
look at the physiology and then the

people he was giving these chemicals to
 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.790
people he was giving these chemicals to
kept coming back and telling him these

kept coming back and telling him these
 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.490
kept coming back and telling him these
these crazy stories and well it just it

was too much for him you know and no
 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.670
was too much for him you know and no
wonder you know because they all said

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680
wonder you know because they all said
 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.020
wonder you know because they all said
the same thing and he'd say well that

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030
the same thing and he'd say well that
 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.460
the same thing and he'd say well that
was a dream and they say no and it was

was a dream and they say no and it was
 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.870
was a dream and they say no and it was
the most real thing that ever happened

to me and he'd say well you know it's an
 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.070
to me and he'd say well you know it's an
archetypal experience and they'd say no

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080
archetypal experience and they'd say no
 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.690
archetypal experience and they'd say no
no no that was no archetypal experience

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700
no no that was no archetypal experience

I went somewhere else and I saw things

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470
I went somewhere else and I saw things
 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.170
I went somewhere else and I saw things
and I'm back and like I don't care what

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180
and I'm back and like I don't care what
 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.090
and I'm back and like I don't care what
you think and like who the hell knows

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100
you think and like who the hell knows
 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.280
you think and like who the hell knows
right because it's all subjective but

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290
right because it's all subjective but
 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.930
right because it's all subjective but
but the weird thing about it is that

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940
but the weird thing about it is that
 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.210
but the weird thing about it is that
everyone's reporting the same thing how

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220
everyone's reporting the same thing how
 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.390
everyone's reporting the same thing how
the hell do you account

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400
the hell do you account
 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.189
the hell do you account
for that and then the shaman you know

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199
for that and then the shaman you know
 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:30.840
for that and then the shaman you know
when they take these psychedelic

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850
when they take these psychedelic
 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.370
when they take these psychedelic
chemicals they basically say the same

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380
chemicals they basically say the same
 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.800
chemicals they basically say the same
thing they say well first of all it more

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810
thing they say well first of all it more
 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.110
thing they say well first of all it more
or less killed me

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120
or less killed me
 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.379
or less killed me
that's this you know I dissolved two

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389
that's this you know I dissolved two
 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:42.600
that's this you know I dissolved two
skeleton and then I climbed the tree

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610
skeleton and then I climbed the tree
 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.520
skeleton and then I climbed the tree
that unites heaven and earth and I went

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530
that unites heaven and earth and I went
 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.620
that unites heaven and earth and I went
into the realm of the gods and they gave

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630
into the realm of the gods and they gave
 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.749
into the realm of the gods and they gave
me some information and I'm back it's

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:48.759
me some information and I'm back it's
 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:51.210
me some information and I'm back it's
like okay well you know we don't really

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220
like okay well you know we don't really
 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.159
like okay well you know we don't really
know what to make of that and we and

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169
know what to make of that and we and
 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:54.870
know what to make of that and we and
certainly that's what Elia describes

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880
certainly that's what Elia describes
 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.610
certainly that's what Elia describes
when he describes the shamanic the

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620
when he describes the shamanic the
 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.499
when he describes the shamanic the
shamanic procession not the shamanic

00:04:58.499 --> 00:04:58.509
shamanic procession not the shamanic
 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:00.930
shamanic procession not the shamanic
initiation and you know there's

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940
initiation and you know there's
 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.969
initiation and you know there's
dissolution to a skeleton first and then

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979
dissolution to a skeleton first and then
 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:04.770
dissolution to a skeleton first and then
like a death the symbolic death or

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780
like a death the symbolic death or
 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.020
like a death the symbolic death or
experienced as an actual death and then

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030
experienced as an actual death and then
 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.450
experienced as an actual death and then
bang up into the realm of the gods and

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460
bang up into the realm of the gods and
 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.870
bang up into the realm of the gods and
then they come back it's a very old idea

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880
then they come back it's a very old idea
 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.300
then they come back it's a very old idea
and that's a medieval representation of

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310
and that's a medieval representation of
 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.159
and that's a medieval representation of
the tunnel that people travel through at

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169
the tunnel that people travel through at
 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:18.930
the tunnel that people travel through at
the end of their life to you know to

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940
the end of their life to you know to
 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.730
the end of their life to you know to
find the light which is a very common

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740
find the light which is a very common
 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.740
find the light which is a very common
near-death experience report and people

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750
near-death experience report and people
 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.300
near-death experience report and people
don't have any idea what the hell to do

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310
don't have any idea what the hell to do
 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.610
don't have any idea what the hell to do
with those reports except say well it's

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620
with those reports except say well it's
 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.310
with those reports except say well it's
the paroxysm zuv the dying brain which

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320
the paroxysm zuv the dying brain which
 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.629
the paroxysm zuv the dying brain which
you'd expect to be a hell of a lot more

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639
you'd expect to be a hell of a lot more
 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:33.210
you'd expect to be a hell of a lot more
random in my opinion and the idea is

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220
random in my opinion and the idea is
 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.879
random in my opinion and the idea is
there's a rebirth after that and you

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889
there's a rebirth after that and you
 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:38.400
there's a rebirth after that and you
know here this is the Scandinavian

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410
know here this is the Scandinavian
 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.379
know here this is the Scandinavian
representation of that tree that unites

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:40.389
representation of that tree that unites
 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:42.839
representation of that tree that unites
earth with heaven and so there's the

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:42.849
earth with heaven and so there's the
 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:44.430
earth with heaven and so there's the
Scandinavian representation it has a

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440
Scandinavian representation it has a
 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.860
Scandinavian representation it has a
snake snakes down here eating it and

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870
snake snakes down here eating it and
 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.189
snake snakes down here eating it and
then that's the Amazonian representation

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199
then that's the Amazonian representation
 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:52.230
then that's the Amazonian representation
it's like how the hell do you account

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240
it's like how the hell do you account
 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.480
it's like how the hell do you account
for that I mean those those pictures are

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490
for that I mean those those pictures are
 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.210
for that I mean those those pictures are
so similar that it's just it's beyond

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220
so similar that it's just it's beyond
 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.330
so similar that it's just it's beyond
belief well you know we lived in trees

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340
belief well you know we lived in trees
 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.480
belief well you know we lived in trees
for a long time a long long long long

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490
for a long time a long long long long
 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.510
for a long time a long long long long
time millions of years and there were

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520
time millions of years and there were
 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.909
time millions of years and there were
lots of snakes around them and so the

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:08.919
lots of snakes around them and so the
 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:10.649
lots of snakes around them and so the
idea that reality is a tree that's

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:10.659
idea that reality is a tree that's
 

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:13.050
idea that reality is a tree that's
surrounded by a snake is that's in us

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060
surrounded by a snake is that's in us
 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.240
surrounded by a snake is that's in us
man it's down there it's deep and

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250
man it's down there it's deep and
 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.000
man it's down there it's deep and
there's something about it that's true

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.010
there's something about it that's true
 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.800
there's something about it that's true
now not true like we normally think of

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810
now not true like we normally think of
 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.779
now not true like we normally think of
truth a truth true in an entirely

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:21.789
truth a truth true in an entirely
 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:25.560
truth a truth true in an entirely
different manner so and all that's

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:25.570
different manner so and all that's
 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.300
different manner so and all that's
pretty damn strange we'll stop with this

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310
pretty damn strange we'll stop with this
 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.830
pretty damn strange we'll stop with this
my son drew this when he was seven years

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840
my son drew this when he was seven years
 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.830
my son drew this when he was seven years
old blew me away man I thought it was so

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840
old blew me away man I thought it was so
 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.770
old blew me away man I thought it was so
