00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:05.690
The point negative 8 comma, 5
is reflected across the y-axis.

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:11.550
Plot negative 8 comma 5 and its
reflection across the y-axis.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.230
So first let's plot
negative 8 comma 5.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.340
So its x-coordinate
is negative 8,

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.090
so I'll just use this
one right over here.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.340
So the x-coordinate is negative
8, and the y-coordinate is 5,

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.610
so I'll go up 5.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.830
So the y-coordinate
is 5 right over here.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.880
You see negative 8 and 5.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.380
We've gone 8 to the left
because it's negative,

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.790
and then we've gone 5 up,
because it's a positive 5.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.320
So we've plotted
negative 8 comma 5.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.147
Now we have to plot its
reflection across the y-axis.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.979
And so you can imagine if
this was some type of lake

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:49.520
or something and you were to
see its reflection, and this is,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.600
say, like the moon, you would
see its reflection roughly

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.260
around here.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.270
You would see an equal
distance away from the y-axis.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.880
So you would see it at 8 to
the right of the y-axis, which

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:08.050
would be at positive 8, and
still 5 above the x-axis.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.310
So that's its reflection
right over here.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.330
It's reflection is
the point 8 comma 5.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.270
Let's do a couple more of these.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.140
The point negative
6 comma negative 7

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.090
is reflec-- this should say
"reflected" across the x-axis.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.010
Plot negative 6 comma
negative 7 and its reflection

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.140
across the x-axis.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.900
So negative 6 comma
negative 7, so we're

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.850
going to go 6 to the
left of the origin,

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.490
and we're going to go down 7.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.230
So there we go.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.740
Negative 6 comma negative
7 is right there.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.940
And we are reflecting
across the x-axis.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.240
So, once again, if
you imagine that this

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.130
is some type of a lake,
or maybe some type

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.970
of an upside-down
lake, or a mirror,

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.330
where would we think
we see its reflection?

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.882
Well, its reflection would
be the same distance.

00:01:59.882 --> 00:02:01.340
We're reflecting
across the x-axis,

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.230
so it would be the
same distance, but now

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.630
above the x-axis.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.640
So this was 7 below.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.580
Now we're going to go
7 above the x-axis,

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.939
and it's going to be at
the same x-coordinate.

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:13.480
So there you have
it right over here.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.690
We reflected this
point to right up here,

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.710
because we reflected
across the x-axis.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:19.990
Let's check our answer.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.890
Let's do one more.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:29.461
The point B is a reflection
of point A across which axis?

00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:31.210
So let's think about
this right over here.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.320
This is at the point
negative 6 comma 5.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.540
This is at the point
negative 5 comma 6.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.170
Let's see.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.200
It doesn't look like
it's only one axis.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.490
If I were to reflect this
point across the y-axis,

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.649
it would go all the
way to positive 6, 5.

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:49.440
So it would go all the
way right over here.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.830
So if I reflect A just across
the y-axis, it would go there.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.400
And then if I reflected that
point across the x-axis,

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.040
then I would end up
at 5 below the x-axis

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.760
at an x-coordinate of 6.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.830
So to go from A to B, you could
reflect across the y and then

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.680
the x, or you could
reflect across the x,

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.910
and it would get
you right over here.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.600
It would get you to
negative 6 comma 5,

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.290
and then reflect across the y.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.230
So it's really reflecting
across both axes.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.504
So we would reflect across the
x-axis and then the y-axis.

00:03:25.504 --> 00:03:26.920
It would have also
been legitimate

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.510
if we said the y-axis
and then the x-axis.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.540
Let's check our answer.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.470
We got it right.
