00:00:12.951 --> 00:00:15.952
So people tell me I'm a nice person ...

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.063
to the point where it's part
of my personal and professional identity

00:00:22.087 --> 00:00:26.426
that I'm so nice
and able to get along with anyone,

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.684
even my most fierce opponents.

00:00:30.837 --> 00:00:33.047
It's like my "thing,"
it's what I'm known for.

00:00:33.071 --> 00:00:36.037
(Laughter)

00:00:36.061 --> 00:00:38.997
But what no one knows ...

00:00:41.063 --> 00:00:42.586
is that I was a bully.

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:47.121
Honestly, I didn't think
about it much myself.

00:00:47.145 --> 00:00:50.623
I buried the memories for years,

00:00:50.647 --> 00:00:54.179
and even still, a lot of it's really hazy.

00:00:54.203 --> 00:00:56.846
Denial, by the way, apparently
is also one of my things.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.099
(Laughter)

00:00:58.123 --> 00:01:00.679
But the more people started to praise me

00:01:00.703 --> 00:01:03.466
for being a liberal who could
get along with conservatives,

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.641
and the more I wrote articles
about being nice

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:08.689
and gave talks about being nice,

00:01:08.713 --> 00:01:12.868
the more I felt this hypocrisy
creeping up inside me.

00:01:14.865 --> 00:01:16.690
What if I was actually really mean?

00:01:19.877 --> 00:01:22.614
When I was 10 years old,

00:01:24.155 --> 00:01:27.175
there was a girl in my class
at school named Vicky.

00:01:27.199 --> 00:01:28.648
(Sigh)

00:01:28.672 --> 00:01:30.218
And I tormented her ...

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.480
mercilessly.

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:36.750
I mean, everyone did.

00:01:36.774 --> 00:01:38.358
Even the teachers picked on her.

00:01:39.769 --> 00:01:41.666
It doesn't make it any better, does it?

00:01:42.975 --> 00:01:46.318
Vicky was clearly a troubled kid.

00:01:46.342 --> 00:01:48.884
She would hit herself
and give herself bloody noses

00:01:48.908 --> 00:01:50.425
and she had hygiene problems --

00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:52.310
she had big hygiene problems.

00:01:53.193 --> 00:01:55.338
But instead of helping this girl,

00:01:55.362 --> 00:01:58.495
who was plainly suffering
from hardships in her life ...

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:01.809
we called her "Sticky Vicky."

00:02:03.821 --> 00:02:05.571
I called her "Sticky Vicky."

00:02:08.634 --> 00:02:12.993
My clearest memory
is standing in the empty hallway

00:02:13.017 --> 00:02:14.947
outside the fifth grade classrooms

00:02:14.971 --> 00:02:17.771
waiting for Vicky
to come out of the bathroom,

00:02:17.795 --> 00:02:20.986
and I have a clipboard and a pen
and a survey I've made up,

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.776
asking about shampoo preferences,

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.915
like I'm doing a study
for science class or something.

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.340
And when Vicky comes out of the bathroom,

00:02:28.364 --> 00:02:31.174
I pounce on her and I ask her
what shampoo she uses.

00:02:31.198 --> 00:02:33.404
Now, to put this in perspective,

00:02:33.428 --> 00:02:35.471
I can't remember the names of my teachers,

00:02:35.495 --> 00:02:38.512
I can't remember the names
of any of the books I read that year,

00:02:38.536 --> 00:02:41.108
I pretty much can't remember
anything from fifth grade,

00:02:41.132 --> 00:02:44.079
but I remember that Vicky told me
she used White Rain shampoo.

00:02:45.285 --> 00:02:46.466
Clear as yesterday,

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.640
like it just happened.

00:02:48.775 --> 00:02:49.925
And as classes let out,

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:52.728
I ran down the hall shouting
at all the other kids,

00:02:52.752 --> 00:02:55.109
"Sticky Vicky uses White Rain shampoo.

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:57.004
Don't use White Rain shampoo

00:02:57.028 --> 00:03:00.185
or you'll smell like Sticky Vicky."

00:03:02.641 --> 00:03:04.642
I forgot about this memory
for a long time.

00:03:04.666 --> 00:03:06.506
When I finally started remembering it,

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.151
I immediately needed to know more.

00:03:08.175 --> 00:03:10.667
I reached out to friends
and eventually social media,

00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:13.026
and I did everything I could
to try to find Vicky.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.852
I needed to know that she was OK,

00:03:15.876 --> 00:03:17.546
and that I hadn't ruined her life.

00:03:19.471 --> 00:03:20.510
(Sigh)

00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:22.054
But what I quickly realized

00:03:22.078 --> 00:03:25.030
was I wasn't just trying to figure out
what happened to Vicky.

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:27.656
I was trying to figure out
what happened to me.

00:03:29.802 --> 00:03:31.096
When I was 10 years old,

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.889
I treated another human being
like some worthless other ...

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.296
like I was better than her,

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:40.568
and she was garbage.

00:03:42.076 --> 00:03:43.906
What kind of a nice person does that?

00:03:44.578 --> 00:03:46.189
I mean, I know I was only a kid,

00:03:46.213 --> 00:03:47.695
but not all kids do that.

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:49.968
Most kids don't do that, right?

00:03:51.168 --> 00:03:53.537
So, what if I wasn't nice after all?

00:03:53.561 --> 00:03:56.378
I was really just a hateful monster.

00:03:57.914 --> 00:04:02.806
Then I started to notice myself
having these mean impulses,

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.676
thinking mean thoughts

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:05.916
and wanting to say them.

00:04:08.026 --> 00:04:11.195
Admittedly, most of my mean thoughts
were about conservatives.

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:16.009
(Laughter)

00:04:16.033 --> 00:04:17.361
But not just conservatives.

00:04:17.385 --> 00:04:21.486
I also caught myself thinking mean things
about mushy, centrist liberals

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.388
and greedy Wall Street bankers

00:04:23.412 --> 00:04:24.870
and Islamophobes

00:04:24.894 --> 00:04:26.368
and slow drivers,

00:04:26.392 --> 00:04:28.677
because I really hate slow drivers.

00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:31.220
(Laughter)

00:04:31.244 --> 00:04:34.244
And as I'd catch myself
in these moments of hypocrisy,

00:04:34.268 --> 00:04:37.967
either I was just noticing them
or they were getting worse,

00:04:37.991 --> 00:04:39.574
especially in the last few years.

00:04:40.149 --> 00:04:42.274
And as I felt more hateful --

00:04:42.298 --> 00:04:44.586
rageful, really --

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.850
I noticed the world around me
seemed to be getting more hateful, too.

00:04:47.874 --> 00:04:50.428
Like there was this steady
undercurrent of hate

00:04:50.452 --> 00:04:52.557
bubbling up all around us

00:04:52.581 --> 00:04:54.288
and increasingly overflowing.

00:04:55.973 --> 00:04:58.461
So the plus side, I guess,

00:04:58.485 --> 00:05:03.703
is that I realized that hate
was not just my problem,

00:05:03.727 --> 00:05:06.822
which is like, the most
selfish plus side ever --

00:05:06.846 --> 00:05:08.373
(Laughter)

00:05:08.813 --> 00:05:14.329
because now instead of just my own hate
and cruelty to try to figure out,

00:05:14.353 --> 00:05:18.334
I had a whole world of hate
I wanted to unravel

00:05:18.358 --> 00:05:20.413
and understand and fix.

00:05:22.506 --> 00:05:27.483
So I did what all overly intellectual
people do when they have a problem

00:05:27.507 --> 00:05:29.054
that they want to understand,

00:05:29.078 --> 00:05:30.229
and I wrote a book.

00:05:30.253 --> 00:05:32.434
(Laughter)

00:05:33.026 --> 00:05:34.919
I wrote a book about hate.

00:05:35.407 --> 00:05:36.557
Spoiler alert:

00:05:37.443 --> 00:05:38.594
I'm against it.

00:05:38.618 --> 00:05:41.395
(Laughter)

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:44.001
Now at this point,
you might be thinking to yourself,

00:05:44.025 --> 00:05:45.825
"Why are y'all worried about hate?

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:47.000
You didn't hate Vicky.

00:05:47.024 --> 00:05:48.800
Bullying isn't hate."

00:05:50.474 --> 00:05:51.624
Isn't it?

00:05:53.267 --> 00:05:54.576
Gordon Allport,

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.822
the psychologist who pioneered
the study of hate in the early 1900s,

00:05:58.846 --> 00:06:01.339
developed what he called
a "scale of prejudice."

00:06:01.363 --> 00:06:07.085
At one end are things like genocide
and other bias-motivated violence.

00:06:07.109 --> 00:06:08.641
But at the other end

00:06:08.665 --> 00:06:11.830
are things like believing
that your in-group

00:06:11.854 --> 00:06:15.450
is inherently superior to some out-group,

00:06:15.474 --> 00:06:20.237
or avoiding social interaction
with those others.

00:06:21.583 --> 00:06:22.789
Isn't that all hate?

00:06:24.186 --> 00:06:25.997
I mean, it wasn't an accident

00:06:26.021 --> 00:06:29.187
that I was a rich kid
picking on a poor kid,

00:06:30.982 --> 00:06:35.212
or that Vicky, it turns out,
would eventually end up being gay.

00:06:36.861 --> 00:06:40.954
Poor kids and gay kids
are more likely to be bullied,

00:06:40.978 --> 00:06:44.263
even by kids who also end up being gay.

00:06:45.988 --> 00:06:48.894
I know there was a lot going on
in my little 10-year-old mind.

00:06:48.918 --> 00:06:51.586
I'm not saying hate was the only
reason I picked on Vicky

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.584
or even that I was consciously
hateful or anything,

00:06:54.608 --> 00:06:56.436
but the fact is,

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:01.405
the people we discriminate against
in our public policies and in our culture

00:07:01.429 --> 00:07:06.008
are also the groups of people
most likely to be bullied in school.

00:07:07.984 --> 00:07:09.666
That is not just a coincidence.

00:07:11.799 --> 00:07:13.190
That's hate.

00:07:15.554 --> 00:07:17.925
I am defining hate in a broad way

00:07:19.451 --> 00:07:22.340
because I think we have a big problem.

00:07:23.214 --> 00:07:26.873
And we need to solve all of it,
not just the most extremes.

00:07:26.897 --> 00:07:28.148
So for instance,

00:07:28.172 --> 00:07:30.736
we probably all agree
that marching down the street,

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.038
chanting about you should take away
rights from some group of people

00:07:34.062 --> 00:07:36.112
because of their skin color
or their gender,

00:07:36.136 --> 00:07:38.085
we'd all agree that's hate, right? OK.

00:07:39.594 --> 00:07:43.387
What if you believe
that group of people is inferior,

00:07:44.771 --> 00:07:45.981
but you don't say it?

00:07:47.546 --> 00:07:48.696
Is that hate?

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:53.400
Or what if you believe
that group of people is inferior

00:07:53.424 --> 00:07:55.694
but you aren't aware
that you believe it --

00:07:55.718 --> 00:07:57.304
what's known as implicit bias.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:59.140
Is that hate?

00:07:59.918 --> 00:08:02.157
I mean they all have
the same roots, don't they?

00:08:02.181 --> 00:08:05.195
In the historic patterns
of racism and sexism

00:08:05.219 --> 00:08:08.303
that have shaped our history
and still infect our society today.

00:08:08.327 --> 00:08:09.808
Isn't it all hate?

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:13.066
I'm not saying they're the same thing,

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:15.416
just like I am not saying

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.194
that being a bully
is as bad as being a Nazi,

00:08:18.218 --> 00:08:22.162
just like I'm not saying that being a Nazi
is the same thing as punching a Nazi ...

00:08:22.636 --> 00:08:28.335
(Laughter)

00:08:28.359 --> 00:08:32.353
But hating a Nazi is still hate, right?

00:08:33.294 --> 00:08:36.010
What about hating someone
who isn't as enlightened as you?

00:08:37.231 --> 00:08:39.302
See, what I learned

00:08:40.533 --> 00:08:43.073
is that we all are against hate

00:08:43.097 --> 00:08:45.104
and we all think hate is a problem.

00:08:45.929 --> 00:08:47.668
We think it's their problem,

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:49.993
not our problem.

00:08:50.824 --> 00:08:52.126
They're hateful.

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.219
I mean, if I think the people
who didn't vote like me

00:08:55.243 --> 00:08:58.720
are stupid racist monsters who don't
deserve to call themselves Americans,

00:08:58.744 --> 00:09:00.423
alright, fine, I'm not being nice,

00:09:00.447 --> 00:09:01.694
I get it.

00:09:01.718 --> 00:09:03.115
(Laughter)

00:09:03.139 --> 00:09:06.409
I'm not hateful, I'm just right, right?

00:09:06.433 --> 00:09:08.116
(Laughter)

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.290
Wrong.

00:09:11.346 --> 00:09:13.695
We all hate.

00:09:14.568 --> 00:09:18.818
And I do not mean that
in some abstract, generic sense.

00:09:18.842 --> 00:09:21.043
I mean all of us ...

00:09:22.571 --> 00:09:24.111
me and you.

00:09:25.684 --> 00:09:30.929
That sanctimonious pedestal of superiority
on which we all place ourselves,

00:09:30.953 --> 00:09:34.280
that they are hateful and we are not,

00:09:34.304 --> 00:09:38.178
is a manifestation
of the essential root of hate:

00:09:38.202 --> 00:09:41.731
that we are fundamentally good
and they are not,

00:09:43.106 --> 00:09:44.695
which is what needs to change.

00:09:45.968 --> 00:09:49.725
So in trying to understand and solve hate,

00:09:49.749 --> 00:09:52.667
I read every book
and every research study I could find,

00:09:52.691 --> 00:09:56.857
but I also went and talked
to some former Nazis

00:09:56.881 --> 00:09:58.390
and some former terrorists

00:09:58.414 --> 00:10:01.026
and some former genocidal killers,

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:05.234
because I figured if they could
figure out how to escape hate,

00:10:05.258 --> 00:10:06.688
surely the rest of us could.

00:10:07.617 --> 00:10:11.804
Let me give you just one example
of the former terrorist I spent time with

00:10:11.828 --> 00:10:13.076
in the West Bank.

00:10:13.719 --> 00:10:16.569
When Bassam Aramin was 16 years old,

00:10:17.692 --> 00:10:22.017
he tried to blow up an Israeli
military convoy with a grenade.

00:10:23.828 --> 00:10:26.202
He failed, fortunately,

00:10:26.226 --> 00:10:28.656
but he was still sentenced
to seven years in prison.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.617
When he was in prison,
they showed a film about the Holocaust.

00:10:31.641 --> 00:10:32.792
Up until that point,

00:10:32.816 --> 00:10:35.685
Bassam had thought the Holocaust
was mostly a myth.

00:10:35.709 --> 00:10:37.509
He went to go watch the film

00:10:37.533 --> 00:10:40.619
because he thought he would enjoy
seeing Jews get killed.

00:10:42.424 --> 00:10:46.187
But when he saw what really happened,
he broke down crying.

00:10:47.691 --> 00:10:49.117
And eventually, after prison,

00:10:49.141 --> 00:10:52.502
Bassam went on to get
a master's degree in Holocaust studies

00:10:52.526 --> 00:10:56.557
and he founded an organization
where former Palestinian combatants

00:10:56.581 --> 00:10:58.962
and Israeli combatants come together,

00:10:59.963 --> 00:11:02.623
work together, try to find common ground.

00:11:04.287 --> 00:11:07.779
By his own account,
Bassam used to hate Israelis,

00:11:09.304 --> 00:11:12.456
but through knowing Israelis
and learning their stories

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.265
and working together for peace,

00:11:14.289 --> 00:11:15.551
he overcame his hate.

00:11:17.654 --> 00:11:21.189
Bassam says he still
doesn't hate Israelis,

00:11:22.183 --> 00:11:23.952
even after the Israeli military --

00:11:25.232 --> 00:11:27.618
shot and killed his [10]-year-old
daughter, Abir,

00:11:27.642 --> 00:11:29.342
while she was walking to school.

00:11:32.021 --> 00:11:34.028
(Sigh)

00:11:34.339 --> 00:11:37.102
Bassam even forgave the soldier
who killed his daughter.

00:11:38.339 --> 00:11:40.100
That soldier, he taught me,

00:11:41.998 --> 00:11:46.220
was just a product
of the same hateful system as he was.

00:11:51.515 --> 00:11:53.727
If a former terrorist ...

00:11:56.169 --> 00:12:00.423
if a terrorist can learn to stop hating

00:12:00.447 --> 00:12:02.591
and still not hate
when their child is killed,

00:12:02.615 --> 00:12:06.621
surely the rest of us can stop our habits

00:12:06.645 --> 00:12:09.255
of demeaning and dehumanizing each other.

00:12:09.279 --> 00:12:12.613
And I will tell you there are stories
like Bassam's all over the world,

00:12:12.637 --> 00:12:14.598
plus study after study after study

00:12:14.622 --> 00:12:19.741
that says, no, we are neither designed
nor destined as human beings to hate,

00:12:19.765 --> 00:12:23.385
but rather taught to hate
by the world around us.

00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:24.584
I promise you,

00:12:24.608 --> 00:12:28.102
none of us pops out of the womb
hating black people or Republicans.

00:12:28.126 --> 00:12:33.015
There is nothing in our DNA
that makes us hate Muslims or Mexicans.

00:12:33.513 --> 00:12:34.715
For better or for worse,

00:12:34.739 --> 00:12:38.291
we are all a product
of the culture around us.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:41.919
And the good news is,

00:12:41.943 --> 00:12:44.687
we're also the ones
who shape that culture,

00:12:46.139 --> 00:12:47.731
which means we can change it.

00:12:48.661 --> 00:12:54.061
The first step is starting to recognize
the hate inside ourselves.

00:12:54.085 --> 00:12:55.694
We need to catch ourselves

00:12:55.718 --> 00:12:58.200
and our hateful thoughts
in all their forms

00:12:58.224 --> 00:12:59.987
in all of us ...

00:13:01.556 --> 00:13:03.924
and work to challenge
our ideas and assumptions.

00:13:03.948 --> 00:13:05.394
That doesn't happen overnight,

00:13:05.418 --> 00:13:06.773
I am telling you right here,

00:13:06.797 --> 00:13:09.701
it is a lifelong journey,
but it's one we all need to take.

00:13:10.367 --> 00:13:11.542
And then second:

00:13:11.566 --> 00:13:14.947
if we want to challenge
the hate in our societies,

00:13:14.971 --> 00:13:18.916
we need to promote policies
and institutions and practices

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.669
that connect us as communities.

00:13:22.295 --> 00:13:25.365
Literally, like integrated
neighborhoods and schools.

00:13:25.389 --> 00:13:27.867
That by the way is the reason
to support integration.

00:13:27.891 --> 00:13:30.144
Not just because
it's the right thing to do,

00:13:30.168 --> 00:13:33.593
but because integration
systematically combats hate.

00:13:33.617 --> 00:13:35.951
There are studies
that teenagers who participate

00:13:35.975 --> 00:13:40.162
in racially integrated classes
and activities reduce their racial bias.

00:13:40.186 --> 00:13:43.556
And when little kids go to racially
integrated kindergartens

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.700
and elementary schools --

00:13:45.724 --> 00:13:47.525
they develop less bias to begin with.

00:13:48.672 --> 00:13:52.593
But the fact is in so many ways
and in so many places around our world,

00:13:52.617 --> 00:13:55.388
we are separated from each other.

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.972
In the United States, for instance,

00:13:58.996 --> 00:14:03.439
three-quarters of white people
don't have any non-white friends.

00:14:04.683 --> 00:14:08.753
So in addition to promoting
those proactive solutions,

00:14:08.777 --> 00:14:12.603
the other thing we need to do
is upend the hate in our institutions

00:14:12.627 --> 00:14:14.063
and our policies

00:14:14.087 --> 00:14:18.826
that perpetuate dehumanization
and difference

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:20.778
and otherizing and hate,

00:14:20.802 --> 00:14:26.541
like systems of sexual harassment
and sexual assault in the workplace,

00:14:26.565 --> 00:14:30.730
or our deeply racially imbalanced

00:14:30.754 --> 00:14:34.125
and deeply racially biased
criminal "justice" system.

00:14:34.814 --> 00:14:36.470
We need to change that.

00:14:36.494 --> 00:14:38.360
Again, it will not happen overnight.

00:14:38.384 --> 00:14:40.334
It needs to happen.

00:14:41.763 --> 00:14:42.913
And then ...

00:14:44.123 --> 00:14:45.615
when we connect together

00:14:46.885 --> 00:14:49.607
in these connection spaces,

00:14:50.518 --> 00:14:53.319
facilitated by connection systems,

00:14:54.591 --> 00:14:57.374
we need to change the way
we talk to each other

00:14:58.992 --> 00:15:00.470
and connect with one another

00:15:00.494 --> 00:15:05.843
and relate with generosity
and open-mindedness

00:15:05.867 --> 00:15:07.272
and kindness and compassion

00:15:07.296 --> 00:15:08.479
and not hate.

00:15:09.837 --> 00:15:11.252
And that's it.

00:15:11.276 --> 00:15:12.427
That's it.

00:15:12.451 --> 00:15:16.713
(Applause)

00:15:16.737 --> 00:15:18.832
I have solved it all, right?

00:15:18.856 --> 00:15:20.007
That's it.

00:15:20.031 --> 00:15:21.190
That is pretty much --

00:15:21.214 --> 00:15:22.381
there's a few details --

00:15:22.405 --> 00:15:24.359
but that's pretty much all we have to do.

00:15:24.383 --> 00:15:26.106
It's not that complicated, right?

00:15:27.556 --> 00:15:28.843
But it's hard.

00:15:30.279 --> 00:15:34.739
The hate that we feel
towards certain groups of people

00:15:35.814 --> 00:15:38.662
because of who they are
or what they believe

00:15:38.686 --> 00:15:42.098
is so ingrained in our minds
and in our society

00:15:42.122 --> 00:15:43.661
that it can feel inevitable

00:15:45.031 --> 00:15:46.477
and impossible to change.

00:15:49.393 --> 00:15:50.677
Change is possible.

00:15:53.148 --> 00:15:57.735
Just look at the terrorist
who became a peace activist.

00:15:59.483 --> 00:16:04.515
Or look at the bully who learned
to apologize to her victim.

00:16:07.338 --> 00:16:12.490
The entire time I was traveling
around the Middle East and Rwanda

00:16:12.514 --> 00:16:13.897
and across the United States,

00:16:13.921 --> 00:16:18.006
hearing these unbelievable stories
of people in communities

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:20.713
who had left entire histories
of hate behind,

00:16:20.737 --> 00:16:22.194
I was still looking for Vicky.

00:16:23.024 --> 00:16:25.810
It was so hard find her that I hired
a private investigator

00:16:25.834 --> 00:16:27.272
and he found her.

00:16:27.296 --> 00:16:29.194
I mean, he sort of found her.

00:16:29.218 --> 00:16:33.523
The truth is, it became clear
that the person I'm calling Vicky

00:16:33.547 --> 00:16:38.339
had gone to extraordinary lengths
to hide her identity.

00:16:40.564 --> 00:16:44.429
But anyway, a year after
I began my journey,

00:16:46.556 --> 00:16:48.052
I wrote Vicky an apology.

00:16:50.199 --> 00:16:51.461
And a few months later,

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:53.750
she wrote back.

00:16:54.667 --> 00:16:56.730
(Sigh)

00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:58.958
I'm not going to lie,

00:16:58.982 --> 00:17:00.684
I wanted to be forgiven.

00:17:05.018 --> 00:17:06.168
I wasn't.

00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:07.342
(Sigh)

00:17:07.815 --> 00:17:10.744
She offered me sort of
conditional forgiveness.

00:17:10.768 --> 00:17:12.021
What she wrote was ...

00:17:13.158 --> 00:17:17.825
"Messages such as yours
cannot absolve you of your past actions.

00:17:18.914 --> 00:17:22.257
The only way to do that
is to improve the world,

00:17:22.281 --> 00:17:24.596
prevent others
from behaving in similar ways

00:17:26.093 --> 00:17:27.602
and foster compassion."

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.402
And Vicky's right.

00:17:33.529 --> 00:17:34.879
Which is why I'm here.

00:17:35.601 --> 00:17:36.752
Thank you.

00:17:36.776 --> 00:17:43.776
(Applause)
