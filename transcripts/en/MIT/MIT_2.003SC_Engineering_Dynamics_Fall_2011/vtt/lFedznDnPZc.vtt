00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.110
PROFESSOR: OK,
let's get started.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.260
Can we get them up?

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.690
So this is our thing spinning.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.180
What are the units of
the generalized force

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.060
in this problem, which
is going to be related

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.130
to the torque at the bottom.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.000
So most people
said Newton meters,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.340
which is the units of torque.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.550
And that would be correct.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.290
So you're going to get
some i theta double dot

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.940
kind of equation of
motion with this,

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.380
as units of moment or torque.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.440
And any external
non-conservative force on it

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.660
would in this case
have units of torque.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.440
OK, next.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.920
So we have a pendulum,
kind of an odd shape.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.590
That is, does it
have symmetries?

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.665
Name a symmetry
that this thing has.

00:01:27.665 --> 00:01:29.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.390
PROFESSOR: You mean axial
then, or a plane, or what?

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.850
PROFESSOR: Axis or a plane, OK.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.880
So this thing has symmetries.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.930
You could convince
yourself pretty quickly

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.820
that the principal
axes with one big

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.590
break down the center of it.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.650
And the other two would
be perpendicular to that.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.800
So is it appropriate to use the
parallel axis theorem to find

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.150
an equation of motion of this
thing for when it's pinned

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.470
at the top?

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.790
And most people said
yes if you said no.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.380
I think parallel
axis theorem works

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.440
just great in this problem.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.670
It's planar motion, and the,
for example, kinetic energy

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:20.245
you can write as 1/2i about
o up there, the hinge point.

00:02:20.245 --> 00:02:24.160
i with respect to that
point theta double dot.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.220
And to do i about
that point, you'd

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.740
use the parallel axis theorem.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:34.970
So i about g plus the
distance l squared times m.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:35.820
This one.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.300
Do you expect a centripetal
acceleration term

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.730
to show up in your
equations of motion?

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.175
And some said yes, some said no.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.010
So the equation of
motion for this,

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.580
I would probably write
in terms of some rotation

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.890
theta of the big disk.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.055
And that will cause the mass on
the string to move up and down.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:12.770
But for the rotating
parts of the system,

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:20.810
are there-- I'll think of
a clear way to word this.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.630
Let's ignore the little mass
going up and down for a moment.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.370
The axis of rotation of
that double disk and hub

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.270
and the bigger disk,
does the axis of rotation

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.636
go through the center
of mass of that disk?

00:03:35.636 --> 00:03:36.552
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:36.552 --> 00:03:37.135
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:03:37.135 --> 00:03:39.713
Is it statically balanced?

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.150
We haven't talked about
balancing in a while.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.940
Good review question for
thinking about a quiz

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.260
next Tuesday.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.840
So what does it
take for something

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:07.400
which is rotating to be
considered statically balanced?

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.694
The axis of rotation must what?

00:04:10.694 --> 00:04:11.630
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.754
PROFESSOR: He says pass
through the center of mass.

00:04:13.754 --> 00:04:16.910
Anybody else have a suggestion,
different suggestion?

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.370
If the axis of rotation passes
through the center of mass,

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.105
is it statically balanced?

00:04:24.105 --> 00:04:27.210
AUDIENCE: It has to
be a principal axis?

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.210
PROFESSOR: Does it have
to be a principal axis?

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.850
What do you think?

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.600
Is that axis passing through
g have to be a principal

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.945
axis in order for it to
be statically balanced?

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.865
Let's see.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.680
I don't have a little--
no, it's too big.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.780
This is just a wheel.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.270
And this is my axle going
through the center of mass.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.400
And it goes through
the center of mass,

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:15.650
and it'll have no tendency
to swing down to a low point

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.710
because the weight, its
weight, is acting right

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:20.820
on its center of mass.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.885
And with respect to this
axle, there's no moment arm.

00:05:23.885 --> 00:05:25.740
So there's no torque
caused by gravity

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:31.320
that could cause this to put its
center of mass below the axle.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.380
So it doesn't
matter, even if I had

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.830
the axis going through here.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.850
As long as that axis
passes through g,

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.750
there is no tendency for this
thing to swing to a low side

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.630
because the mass mg is
acting right on the axle.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:48.690
No moment arm.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.660
So the only condition
for static balance

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.820
for a rotor of any kind,
something rotating,

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.320
to be statically balanced
is for the axis of rotation

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.680
to pass through the mass center.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:11.060
So the rotating part of this
system, the axis of rotation

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.770
passes through the mass
center, that big disk.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.875
Does the little mass, m, rotate?

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:28.450
So it can't be statically
or dynamically in balance.

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:30.390
It's not a rotating system.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.570
It's just a little
translating mass

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.540
that happens to be
pulled up and down

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.770
by the action of this thing.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.610
So the question
was, do you expect

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.040
a centripetal acceleration
term to show up?

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.720
The answer's no.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.840
So let's get back to that.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.730
If you have a static imbalance--
let's say my axis of rotation

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.570
is here.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.190
This is definitely
statically imbalanced now.

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.640
Its mass center is down here.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:02.080
The force of gravity pulls it
down until it hangs straight.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.520
That's how you can just test
to see if you're passing

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.280
through the mass center.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:12.980
So if you have an axis that
does not pass through g,

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.760
then you're
statically imbalanced.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:18.700
And if you rotate
about that axis,

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:25.250
is there a net centripetal force
required as it goes around?

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:26.510
Why?

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.810
AUDIENCE: Because the center
of mass is on the outside.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.620
PROFESSOR: So the center of
mass is some distance away.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.820
And you're swinging
it around and around

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.150
and make that center
of mass go in a circle.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.809
You're applying a
centripetal acceleration

00:07:39.809 --> 00:07:41.350
to the center of
mass, and that takes

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:45.330
a force, which you sometimes
think of as a centrifugal force

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:45.887
pulling out.

00:07:45.887 --> 00:07:47.720
That's what you're going
to have to pull in,

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.800
some m r omega squared.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.710
So no centripetal term would
be expected in this problem.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:57.420
Let's go to the next one.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.500
This one, you had two
different conditions.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:03.740
Either rolling without
slip or rolling with slip.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:08.030
And the question is,
for which conditions

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:10.290
are the generalized
forces associated

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:13.730
with a virtual displacement
of delta theta,

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:18.560
the rotation of the
wheel, equal to zero?

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.200
So remember,
generalized forces are

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.820
the forces that account for
the non-conservative forces

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.350
in the problem.

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:30.070
So if it's rolling down
the hill without slip,

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:35.900
are there any non-conservative
forces acting on it?

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.710
Is there a friction
force acting on it?

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:40.360
Yeah, but does it do any work?

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:44.019
No, because there's no delta
r at the point of application

00:08:44.019 --> 00:08:44.560
of the force.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.300
There's no motion.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:50.650
So for which condition
does the generalized forces

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:51.300
equal to zero?

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.960
Certainly for the condition
when it does not slip.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.740
What about if it does slip?

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.480
Would you expect a
non-conservative force

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.590
to do work on it?

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:04.660
What force would that be?

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:05.800
The friction force.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:11.630
So now, as the wheel turns, that
point of application where it's

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:17.020
sliding, you're actually getting
a little delta omega, delta

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:18.260
theta rather.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.540
You move a little
distance r delta theta,

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.140
dotted with the force.

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.620
You get a certain little
bit of virtual work

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:31.560
done, r delta theta times f.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:36.370
So the only case a is
where you get zero.

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:37.215
Oh, this one.

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:44.970
What's the generalized
force associated with f?

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:46.500
That's this applied force.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.320
It's applied to the rolling
thing going down the hill.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.110
The force is horizontal.

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:56.730
And you're asked what's the
generalized force associated

00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:01.760
with f due to the virtual
displacement delta x?

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:07.980
And x is the motion
of the main cart.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:11.130
So when you're doing
generalized forces,

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:14.230
you think in terms
of virtual work.

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:17.650
Can you imagine that that
cart's moving a little distance

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:23.100
delta x, the main x
in the xyo system?

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.560
It shifts a little
distance delta x.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.360
That force, does it
move-- does the point

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:33.910
of application of that force
move with that delta x?

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:36.092
That's really what the
question comes down to.

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:44.895
This one.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:04.310
So this is your inertial
system, and it's

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:06.700
going to account for the
motion of this object.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:15.300
And then up here,
got your wheel.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:23.680
And we have some coordinate
system attached to this object,

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:27.470
noting the position
of the wheel as it

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:29.860
goes up and down the hill.

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:34.380
So this coordinate's
relative to the moving cart.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.240
This coordinate's inertial.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:43.580
The question's only asking then,
what is the virtual work done

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:49.440
that's associated width delta x
here, some motion of the cart.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:55.960
And it's going to be what we're
looking for, the Qx delta x.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.427
And when we say, OK.

00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:01.135
At the point of
application of the force,

00:12:01.135 --> 00:12:04.170
there's literally F here.

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:06.490
And it's in the horizontal
direction, which is exactly

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:15.060
the same direction as capital X.
So this is equal to the force.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:19.280
And in the problem it's
called-- this is just

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.105
called F. It's a vector.

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:28.310
And we're trying to
deduce the deflection

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:30.140
at the point of application.

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:34.460
I'm going to call it some--
it can be many forces.

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.350
I'm going to call it
F sub i so that we

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:39.580
think of it as one of many.

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:57.260
Times the displacement
delta ri due to delta x.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.740
So this is a vector.

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.100
This is a displacement.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.580
This is a force.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:04.390
The amount of work done
as this force moves

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:09.040
through that
displacement is some F

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:14.300
dot delta r, the movement
at this point i where it's

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:19.490
applied, due to this motion.

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:24.450
So what is the delta r at
this point due to that motion?

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:31.720
So another concept here,
when you're doing this,

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.700
you think of these
mentally one at a time.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.120
How many degrees of freedom
do we have in this problem?

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:43.190
Takes two to completely
describe the motion.

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:46.230
x and this one
attached to the cart.

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:51.750
And you think of
these one at a time.

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.370
So right now,
we're asking what's

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:59.060
the virtual work done by that
force due to movement of this

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:02.870
coordinate only, assuming
this one is frozen?

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:05.680
So this one is not
allowed to move.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.180
So if this is not
allowed to move,

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:12.020
does the position of this change
relative to this cart as you

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:12.907
move the cart?

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:16.360
No.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.910
That one is held fixed.

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:19.950
It moves with the cart.

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:23.760
So if you move the cart
a little distance here,

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:29.060
delta x in this
frame, then this wheel

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:31.810
moves with the
cart that distance.

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:35.500
So how much work gets done?

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:44.430
So this delta ri in this
case is equal to delta x.

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:46.860
And the amount of
work that gets done

00:14:46.860 --> 00:15:00.610
is delta w at point i due to
delta x here is F dot delta x,

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:04.170
but F is in the
capital I direction.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.770
This is in the
capital I direction.

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:10.580
So it's just F delta x.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:11.930
is the work done.

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:14.760
And that's Qx delta x.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:23.580
So the generalized
force is just F.

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:24.500
All right.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.310
What else we got?

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.106
OK, wait a minute.

00:15:32.509 --> 00:15:33.800
Oh, this is due to the dashpot.

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:38.010
What is generalized
force associated

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:42.670
with the dashpot due to
a virtual deflection x1?

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:45.640
Now x1's the
coordinate, that thing

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:46.850
rolling up and down the hill.

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:52.725
So now the same thing,
the dashpot force.

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:05.142
Here's your cart.

00:16:05.142 --> 00:16:05.975
Here's your dashpot.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:20.190
And a free body
diagram of the cart

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:25.740
would show a dashpot force
here, bx dot in that direction.

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:37.890
And if we move the cart,
again, a little bit delta

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:40.655
x, how much work gets done?

00:16:40.655 --> 00:16:42.930
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:45.790
PROFESSOR: This is not the
question asked up there.

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:47.530
Just first this.

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:52.370
How much virtual work gets done
by that in a deflection delta

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:54.180
x?

00:16:54.180 --> 00:17:01.800
Well, it's some Fi dot delta
r due to delta x, which

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.760
is just delta x.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:09.349
So this is some minus bx dot
in the I direction times delta

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:10.900
x in the I again.

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.609
It's just in this
case it's minus.

00:17:13.609 --> 00:17:28.669
So this virtual work done this
time due to just the dashpot.

00:17:28.669 --> 00:17:29.960
I don't know how to write that.

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.250
I don't have a subscript.

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:35.590
So this dashpot
only here, bx dot,

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:40.020
is bx dot minus in
the I direction--

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:46.270
that's the force-- dotted
with the dr that it moves.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:51.870
And the dr that it
moves is just delta x.

00:17:51.870 --> 00:18:00.120
So this would be minus
bx I dot delta x I is

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.280
your virtual work that's done.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:08.750
And this is equal to Qx delta x.

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:14.270
But this is a part of Qx
due only to the dashpot.

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:20.530
And you get minus
bx dot delta x.

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:26.990
So now we've gotten both parts
of the total generalized force

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:32.375
associated with the motion
delta x is F minus bx dot.

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:44.960
In general, this
expression Qx delta x

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:49.740
is the summation over
all of the applied forces

00:18:49.740 --> 00:19:02.640
i dot delta r at i
due to, in this case,

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:07.050
the motion in the x direction.

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:10.150
And we have two
contributions here.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:14.190
They come from the
applied force F and this.

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:16.990
So Qx in this problem
is going to turn out

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:22.554
to be F minus bx dot.

00:19:22.554 --> 00:19:23.970
Now, what about
the other-- what's

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:25.720
really asked in this
problem is how much--

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:29.070
what's the generalized force
associated with the motion

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:32.330
of the wheel down the hill?

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:34.270
This is in the x1 direction.

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:37.770
So now you have a little
virtual deflection delta x1.

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:46.580
How much virtual work
gets done by the dashpot?

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:47.480
AUDIENCE: Zero.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.438
PROFESSOR: I hear zero.

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:54.800
So a little virtual
displacement of delta x1,

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.190
does it move the main cart?

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:00.750
That's really what's
going on here.

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:05.360
Does the main cart move because
the wheel and the main cart

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.615
change relative
position a little bit?

00:20:11.054 --> 00:20:11.597
AUDIENCE: No.

00:20:11.597 --> 00:20:12.180
PROFESSOR: No.

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.180
I hear no here.

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:16.000
I mean, that's the--
the coordinate x1

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.620
is the relative motion between
the cart and the wheel.

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:23.840
And it's independent of the
motion of the cart with respect

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:27.130
to the inertial frame.

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:29.520
So any motion of
the little wheel

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.405
does not affect the main cart.

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:38.200
So there's no virtual
work done by that dashpot

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.901
because the wheel moves
up and down the hill.

00:20:40.901 --> 00:20:42.650
And it makes sense,
physical sense, right?

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:44.650
The wheel can sit and roll up
and down the hill all day long.

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:46.150
It's not going to
move that dashpot.

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:51.180
Next.

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.110
This problem.

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:56.471
I just realized this problem's
harder than I thought it was.

00:20:56.471 --> 00:20:59.484
It's one of those things
that you look at it,

00:20:59.484 --> 00:21:00.775
oh, that looks straightforward.

00:21:00.775 --> 00:21:02.630
Then I looked at
Audrey's solution

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:05.030
and said, oh, she did it right.

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:08.140
And this is a little trickier
than you might think.

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:12.330
So are the Axyz axes,
which rotate with the hub--

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:15.500
so there's a rotating
there-- definitely

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:19.010
principal coordinates
of that rod?

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:19.970
That's not a problem.

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:21.730
But are they
principal coordinates

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:24.040
for that disk out on the end?

00:21:26.986 --> 00:21:28.361
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:28.361 --> 00:21:29.110
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:31.090
AUDIENCE: Depends if
it's slipping or not.

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:32.256
PROFESSOR: Depends if it's--

00:21:32.256 --> 00:21:34.260
AUDIENCE: Slipping or not.

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:38.275
PROFESSOR: Actually,
I don't think so.

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:44.370
Let's just talk about--
principal coordinates

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:47.000
need to be attached
to the body, right?

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.890
So problems like this do--
let's say we're using Lagrange,

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:54.930
and we want to calculate
the total kinetic-- you

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:58.030
need to calculate the total
kinetic energy of the system.

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:02.190
So how would you go about
breaking this thing down

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:04.610
to compute the total
kinetic energy?

00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:09.420
Would you break it into
more than one part?

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.259
What would be the natural
things to break it into?

00:22:12.259 --> 00:22:13.550
AUDIENCE: The disk and the rod.

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:15.174
PROFESSOR: The disk
and the rod, right?

00:22:15.174 --> 00:22:19.090
So the kinetic energy
of the rod, that's

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:20.090
pretty straightforward.

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:28.040
It's 1/2i with respect to the
center, theta dot squared,

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.380
omega squared.

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:32.830
But the kinetic energy
of that disk out

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:41.920
there, you need to account for
its rotation and its movement

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:45.760
of its center of
mass in the circle.

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:53.160
So let's-- I'm winging it now,
so bear with me if I make any

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:53.720
mistakes.

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:54.640
You can help me out.

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:03.740
T rod would be-- and
our coordinate system

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:06.810
is an A at the center.

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:15.330
There actually isn't a--
oh yeah, there's the A.

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:17.310
So T of the rod,
I would argue, is

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:36.040
1/2M of the rod omega
squared ML squared over 3.

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.160
Because it's rotating
about one end.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.490
So apply the parallel
axis theorem.

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:44.630
The kinetic energy
of the rod is 1/2M i

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:49.220
with respect to that
central axis, omega squared.

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:52.880
And so that gets you
from ML squared over 12

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:56.830
to ML squared over 3 because
you're swinging around one end.

00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:59.240
But now we need T of the disk.

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:04.160
And to do T of the
disk, I would do it

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:12.870
by saying 1/2M of the disk
velocity of this center of mass

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:19.220
of the disk in o
dot VGo-- so that

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:24.830
takes care of its kinetic
energy due to motion

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:43.170
of its center of mass-- plus 1/2
omega dot H with respect to G.

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:45.990
With respect to
G, can you express

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:50.870
H for the disk in terms of
a mass moment of inertia

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:53.487
and some rotations,
rotation rates?

00:24:53.487 --> 00:24:54.195
Is it legitimate?

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:08.440
Remember, I started-- a few
days ago, I started the top

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:12.530
and said, here's the general
expression for kinetic energy.

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:14.170
Full 3D, right?

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:20.550
And it basically
was that expression.

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:23.380
That works full 3D.

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:28.220
And then when you fix a
point about which something

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:33.760
is rotating, a rigid body,
then you can simplify it.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:38.070
But in this case, H, you could
represent the angular momentum

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:42.600
around G as some I omega.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:46.920
And then you have to multiply
it by-- so this inside of here

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:51.830
will be-- you can
represent this in here

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:57.650
as some I omega
dotted with omega,

00:25:57.650 --> 00:26:00.030
and you will get
the kinetic energy

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:02.350
due to the rotation of the disk.

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:05.160
What makes this problem a
little trickier than I thought--

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:06.740
I wasn't thinking
really clearly--

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:12.520
is that omega is in-- what
frame do you express omega

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:17.000
in when you're
computing H in terms

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.320
of mass moments of inertia?

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:25.580
In order to compute I, you have
to use what coordinate system?

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:26.550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:27.980
PROFESSOR: Body fixed.

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:31.610
And when you compute I
omega, what's the omega?

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:35.394
What unit vectors is
the omega expressed in?

00:26:35.394 --> 00:26:37.814
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:37.814 --> 00:26:40.240
It's rotating, but
it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.560
PROFESSOR: But in what--
so the unit vector's

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.330
associated with what coordinate
system are the ones that you

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:47.458
use to define omega?

00:26:47.458 --> 00:26:48.880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:52.110
PROFESSOR: The one attached
to the body or not?

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:54.940
Generally in terms of the
one attached to the body.

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:58.035
And the disk gets-- that
means they're rotating.

00:26:58.035 --> 00:26:59.400
It gets a little messy.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.860
So I'm not going
to do it because I

00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:02.930
can't do it in my head.

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:07.780
So this one you need to do
the kinetic energy of that.

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:09.950
You need to use this approach.

00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:15.020
And you have to be
careful with those.

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.520
Food for thought at office
hours and in recitation.

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:21.445
All right.

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:35.480
I had meant to start
today-- we're well in,

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:40.297
and I haven't even started where
I was going to really go today.

00:27:40.297 --> 00:27:41.630
So I have kind of a broken play.

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:43.030
I have to decide what to drop.

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:43.755
Give me a moment.

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:33.790
So the principal thing I
wanted to talk about today

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:38.210
was to dig a little deeper into
finding generalized forces.

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:40.830
And the way we've
been doing it is

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:42.840
what I would call kind
of an intuitive approach.

00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:52.270
So let's imagine we've
got a rigid body.

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:03.356
And I have some forces
acting on it, F1.

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:21.780
And at the point of application
of each of these forces,

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:24.050
I can have a position
vector that goes there.

00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:31.580
So there's R1, R2, R3.

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:37.990
And they're all with
respect to my o frame here,

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:40.700
but I'm going to not
write in all the o's.

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:56.890
Let's say that this is
a body in planar motion.

00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:58.300
So it's confined to a plane.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:59.280
It's a rigid body.

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.380
It's like my disk there.

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:03.940
So how many degrees
of freedom at most

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:07.700
would it have if
there's no constraints?

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:08.570
Three, right?

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:12.480
It could move in the x, in the
y, and it can rotate in the z.

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:14.570
So potentially three
degrees of freedom.

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:20.770
So it'll take, let's
say, G is maybe here.

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:30.910
So we need three
generalized coordinates.

00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:36.260
And they would be, say, x, y,
and some rotation of theta.

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:48.360
And with them, we have
virtual displacements delta

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:53.530
x, delta y, and delta theta.

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:56.150
And we use those to
figure out the amount

00:30:56.150 --> 00:31:00.450
of non-conservative
work that happens

00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:03.255
when you make those little
small motions occur.

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:16.230
And we're trying to find--
we need to find Qx, Qy, and Q

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:19.910
theta, the generalized
forces associated

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:24.631
with these small variations,
virtual reflections in R3

00:31:24.631 --> 00:31:25.130
coordinates.

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:34.810
So the jth one.

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:36.430
I have a bunch of
forces maybe up

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:40.760
to here, someone
here that's some Fj.

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:47.430
So the generalized
force-- I don't mean that.

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:50.470
These are Fi's.

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:55.420
The j's referred to are
generalized coordinates.

00:31:55.420 --> 00:32:05.505
So generalized
force Qj delta qj.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:19.170
This is the little bit of work
done in the virtual deflection

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:21.500
delta qj.

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:27.630
And there's work done by
all of these applied forces

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:29.630
in the system, possibly.

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:33.960
Every one, if I cause there a
little delta x of this body,

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:39.240
it moves over an amount delta x.

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.840
All of those points of
application of those forces

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:44.320
move a little bit.

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:49.290
And therefore, at every location
a little bit of work gets done.

00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:52.360
So in order to account
for all of the work,

00:32:52.360 --> 00:33:05.050
I have to do a summation
of the Fi dot delta r at i.

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:14.020
And now this is associated
with the virtual displacement

00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:18.030
of generalized coordinate j.

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:24.290
So the total virtual work
done by a displacement

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:30.090
of one of these is a summation
of all the little bits of work

00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:34.660
done at all the points
of application of forces

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:37.190
dotted with the
amount that the point

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:42.740
of application of that force
moves caused by delta qj.

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:48.320
So in general, that's what
the total qj would be.

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:53.070
Now, we've done problems like
that more or less intuitively.

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:55.356
We figured it out and said,
OK, if it moves this much,

00:33:55.356 --> 00:33:56.980
then it's going to
move over that much.

00:33:56.980 --> 00:34:00.050
And if there is an angle between
them, we take the component,

00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:01.350
and we just figure it out.

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:06.164
Is there a more mathematical
way of doing this?

00:34:06.164 --> 00:34:07.580
And so I'm going
to show you that.

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:19.880
So we've been doing this kind
of the intuitive approach here,

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:23.690
the reasoning out each of the
deflections and calculating

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:26.010
the result. That there's
a kinematic-- there's

00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:27.874
an explicit kinematic
way of doing this.

00:34:27.874 --> 00:34:29.040
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:29.706
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:34:29.706 --> 00:34:32.388
AUDIENCE: What is it at the
right corner? [INAUDIBLE]?

00:34:32.388 --> 00:34:33.679
PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK, I'm sorry.

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:37.730
It says-- this is a delta ri.

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:39.530
It has double subscripts here.

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:45.360
This is the displacement at the
point of application of force

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:49.366
i due to the
virtual displacement

00:34:49.366 --> 00:34:54.120
of generalized coordinate j.

00:34:54.120 --> 00:35:01.350
So that an example might be,
if that's delta x over here,

00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:07.440
the summation is over
i, is over F1 F2 to Fi.

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:13.090
And the deflection
is the deflection

00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:17.930
at the point of application
i due to-- in this case

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:22.830
I'm talking about delta x-- due
to the virtual displacements

00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:25.010
delta x.

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:27.930
And so that's-- we'd work each
one of these out and add them

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:29.210
up, and we'd have the answer.

00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:33.370
But there is a more
explicit mathematical way

00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:34.350
of saying this.

00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:47.720
And that is to say that Qj
delta qj is the summation over i

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:52.760
equals 1 to N, however
many there are,

00:35:52.760 --> 00:36:10.450
of Fi dot the derivative of ri
with respect to qj delta qj.

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:14.880
What's that mean?

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:17.500
So let's look at one of these.

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:21.100
So force one, there's
a position vector R1.

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:32.210
If I move in the x
direction a little delta x,

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:36.910
this point moves over
delta x in that direction,

00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:40.810
in the x direction horizontally.

00:36:40.810 --> 00:36:50.190
Our position vector R1 has
potentially components in the y

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:51.860
as well as components in the x.

00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:55.520
But I'm only changing
it in the x direction.

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:58.590
So that portion of
the possible movement

00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:06.110
of R1 due to changes in just
one of the coordinates--

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:10.010
in this case, I was doing
qx-- the derivative of R1

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:12.850
with respect to
qx, so only a part

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:16.780
of its total possible
movement is due to x.

00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:19.480
This gives us that portion.

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:24.510
Times delta qx is
the total movement

00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:29.890
in the direction of qx
dotted with the force.

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:31.610
You get the work done.

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:37.600
So I find this-- if I were
you, this is highly abstract.

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:40.180
I think we need-- let's
do an example of this

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:43.610
and see how it works out.

00:37:43.610 --> 00:37:48.680
And since we were talking
about that problem,

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:51.840
I'll do this cart
by this method.

00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:16.990
So I need a position
vector to the point

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:22.190
of application of this external
non-conservative force.

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:24.540
Because I'm calling
this force one,

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:26.880
I'll call that
position vector R1.

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:31.040
And it goes from here to there.

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:34.530
But we know that the
total motion of this point

00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:36.970
is made up of the
motion of the main cart

00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:41.240
plus the motion of the wheel
relative to the main cart.

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:45.100
And so we fall back
on our notation.

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:48.080
So I'll say this is R1 and zero.

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:51.970
Here's my point A.
It's R is the vector.

00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:57.940
This is R of A with
respect to o plus--

00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:59.860
and we'll better
give this a name.

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:10.410
What have I-- so this
is my point one here.

00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:15.410
So this is plus R1
with respect to A.

00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:17.730
So we've done that lots
of times, this term.

00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:20.970
That's just how-- that point
is the sum of this vector

00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:22.735
plus this vector.

00:40:22.735 --> 00:40:29.230
So you have an R-- this is R1
with respect to A from here

00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:30.250
to here.

00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:32.790
And the sum of those
two is this one.

00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:36.170
So this is R1 here.

00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:41.070
OK, so let's see if we can come
up with an expression for that.

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:53.800
Well, this point A is just x
in the I plus some Y in the J.

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:56.500
That's this term.

00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:59.700
Then I need this one.

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:07.500
So I want-- because I'm going
to take some derivatives

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:10.360
and things, I want to
get everything in terms

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:13.380
of unit vectors and one system.

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:17.010
So I know this
one, this is my x1,

00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:21.210
and it will have a unit
vector i, lowercase i,

00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:23.390
in this direction.

00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:31.810
So the unit vector i here has
components in the capital IJ

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:33.590
system.

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:44.790
And this is theta,
and that's theta.

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:51.830
So this has-- i has
a component here,

00:41:51.830 --> 00:42:00.360
which is cosine theta cap
I, and then this piece is

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:20.430
minus sine theta J.
So this should be x1,

00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:26.990
the distance this thing
moves, broken into two pieces,

00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:35.330
cos theta I minus sine
theta J. So that's now--

00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:43.950
the position of this thing is
the position of the cart at A

00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:49.940
plus the vector that
goes from A to point one,

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:53.330
which is the
distance x1 to here,

00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:55.510
broken into two pieces,
an I piece and a J piece.

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:03.170
So now we're almost done.

00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:06.400
So I would like to find Qx.

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:18.690
And Qx then should be the
summation-- well, let's see.

00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:41.950
So I'm only going to compute the
part of the generalized force

00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:46.030
in the Qx direction due
to just this one force.

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:48.260
Now, remember we
have other forces,

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:50.060
non-conservative
forces, acting on this.

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:52.050
We've got a bx dot too.

00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:55.650
But I'm just going to do
the contribution to Qx

00:43:55.650 --> 00:43:58.360
that comes from this force F1.

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:11.440
And so Qx delta x is
the virtual work done,

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:21.180
is F1I dot partial of R1
with respect to x delta x.

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:35.760
But the derivative of R1
with respect to capital

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:39.820
X, there's no capital
X's over here.

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:42.080
So nothing comes from that.

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:43.690
There's one right here.

00:44:43.690 --> 00:44:46.530
So the derivative of x with
respect to x gives me 1.

00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:49.610
I just get 1 times I back here.

00:44:55.520 --> 00:45:02.280
F1 I hat dot I hat delta x.

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:09.800
So it's just F1 delta x,
which we knew intuitively

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:11.599
when we worked this
problem earlier, when

00:45:11.599 --> 00:45:12.640
we were talking about it.

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:16.410
The amount of virtual
work that gets

00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:23.100
done by this particular force
in a deflection, virtual

00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:26.870
displacement delta x,
it's just F1 delta x.

00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:29.320
But we've proven
it-- we've done it

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:34.640
in a very precise,
kinematic way where

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:38.780
we found the position vector,
worked the whole thing out.

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:40.080
So that's the simple one.

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:49.765
Let's now find the harder
one, but not much now.

00:45:49.765 --> 00:46:09.600
So we'd like to find Qx1 due
to just this F1 only delta x1.

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:19.690
Well, that should be
F1I dot partial of R1

00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:22.826
with respect to x1 delta x1.

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:33.120
So the derivative of R1 with
respect to x1-- this stuff

00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:35.670
has nothing to do with x1.

00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:37.520
The x1 only appears over here.

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:40.830
And the derivative of this
expression, just cosine I minus

00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:59.170
sine theta J.

00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:02.100
So I dot I is the only
part you get back.

00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:06.700
This is-- and I need a delta x1.

00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:13.230
F1I dot I is cosine
theta delta x1.

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:30.170
So Qx1 and F1 only here
equals F1 cosine theta.

00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:37.100
So this time the motion
delta x1, only part of it

00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:40.530
is in the direction of F1.

00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:49.240
And that portion, by taking
this derivative here,

00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:53.640
we get the contribution to
this that comes from x1.

00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:57.300
And then dotted with
the force, we only

00:47:57.300 --> 00:47:59.350
take that component
of that motion

00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:01.650
in the direction of the force.

00:48:01.650 --> 00:48:03.550
And that gives us our
total virtual work.

00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:06.650
So here is then the
total virtual work

00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:11.860
done by F1 due to the
little motion delta x1.

00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:14.120
So now we've got the
contribution here

00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:23.300
to the generalized force that
is associated with deflections

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:24.405
of coordinate x1.

00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:31.980
Is that the total
generalized force

00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:37.990
associated with generalized
coordinate x1 in this problem?

00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:42.140
Are there Any other
non-conservative forces

00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:46.516
in the problem that move
when delta x1 is moved?

00:48:46.516 --> 00:48:48.310
AUDIENCE: What about friction?

00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:50.136
PROFESSOR: Well, let's see.

00:48:50.136 --> 00:48:50.635
Friction.

00:48:53.890 --> 00:48:56.090
Friction, you're
presuming, on the wheel?

00:48:56.090 --> 00:48:56.850
OK.

00:48:56.850 --> 00:48:58.740
So he asked about
friction on the wheel.

00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:05.340
Well, let's say that there's
no slip in this case.

00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:07.960
Then does the friction
at the point of contact

00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:10.021
with the wheel do any work?

00:49:10.021 --> 00:49:10.520
No.

00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:14.230
So do we have to account for
it as a generalized force?

00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:15.930
No.

00:49:15.930 --> 00:49:18.115
So how about the dashpot?

00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:23.860
So a little virtual
deflection, delta x1,

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:27.090
does it make the big cart move?

00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:27.590
No.

00:49:27.590 --> 00:49:31.580
So are there any other
forces in the problem

00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:37.293
that move when you cause
a small movement in x1?

00:49:37.293 --> 00:49:38.160
No.

00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:45.040
So in this case, this
is the total Qx1.

00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:48.580
Up here, we found Qx,
the generalized force

00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:53.820
due to the motion of a cart,
the contribution by F1.

00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:55.580
But is there another
contribution?

00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:56.376
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:49:56.376 --> 00:49:57.250
PROFESSOR: And it is?

00:49:57.250 --> 00:49:58.320
AUDIENCE: The dashpot.

00:49:58.320 --> 00:49:59.278
PROFESSOR: The dashpot.

00:49:59.278 --> 00:50:02.440
So we get additionally
the total Qx

00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:07.650
here total would
be the summation

00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:12.510
of two pieces, an F1 and an
F2, which I'd call minus bx.

00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:15.000
It's in the same
direction as delta x.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:20.700
So you're going to get a
minus bx dot plus F1 would

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:28.100
be the total generalized force
in the capital X direction,

00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:29.630
the movement of the main cart.

00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:43.830
So any time you can actually
specify a position vector

00:50:43.830 --> 00:50:47.380
to the point of application of
an external non-conservative

00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:55.910
force, then you can
just plug it into this.

00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:59.280
You do it at each
force that's applied.

00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:00.780
You take the
derivative with respect

00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:04.810
to that to coordinate
qj, delta qj.

00:51:04.810 --> 00:51:09.570
That is the virtual work
done by each of these forces.

00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:13.970
And you add up to get the
total virtual work done

00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:19.120
due to a deflection at that
particular coordinate, j.

00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:24.530
So in the case of capital of
Qx, we had two contributions

00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:33.250
because we had two forces on the
main cart, F1 and minus bx dot.

00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:36.120
And so the summation
in that problem,

00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:40.020
when this is capital
X, delta X, you

00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:41.770
have two contributions,
F1 and F2.

00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:53.950
Now, what else can I do
in the length of time?

00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:57.910
Actually, let me stop for a
moment there, think about this.

00:51:57.910 --> 00:52:01.160
Would you have any
questions about this?

00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:04.479
So we've described two ways
of getting generalized forces.

00:52:04.479 --> 00:52:06.270
One's kind of the
intuitive one, figure out

00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:07.686
how much it moves
in the direction

00:52:07.686 --> 00:52:09.270
and do the dot product.

00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:11.990
The other one is straight
mathematical way.

00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.620
Kinematics.

00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:17.520
Plug it in, take the derivative,
same thing will come out.

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:19.340
So while you're thinking
about a question,

00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:21.560
I'll look and think what
I was going to do next.

00:52:27.930 --> 00:52:32.160
I know what I'll do next, but do
you have any questions on this?

00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:34.428
I'm going to do another
example of this.

00:52:34.428 --> 00:52:36.404
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:52:36.404 --> 00:52:37.890
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:52:37.890 --> 00:52:39.236
PROFESSOR: Ah, Christina, yeah.

00:52:39.236 --> 00:52:42.722
AUDIENCE: So I still
don't understand how

00:52:42.722 --> 00:52:46.706
if you're going to grab
the wheel and move it,

00:52:46.706 --> 00:52:48.698
how that doesn't move the disk.

00:52:48.698 --> 00:52:52.190
Because they're attached,
so I don't get it.

00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:57.200
PROFESSOR: Is the wheel--
it's all in how you specify

00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:59.830
your generalized coordinates.

00:52:59.830 --> 00:53:03.900
So in this problem, the
two generalized coordinates

00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:07.990
are this capital X in
the inertial system which

00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:11.630
describes the
motion of the cart,

00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:15.470
and little x1
describes the motion

00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:18.990
of the wheel
relative to the cart.

00:53:18.990 --> 00:53:22.960
And actually that allows
you to write this statement.

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:27.760
This is only
relative to the cart.

00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:31.320
So the motion of the cart
plus the motion of the point

00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:34.510
relative to the cart gives
you the total motion.

00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:37.020
And you've picked
two coordinates

00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:40.020
that allow you to
describe those two things.

00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:45.070
So if you can-- in this
problem, if this is the cart,

00:53:45.070 --> 00:53:51.050
this is the wheel, I even have
a spring hooked to it here,

00:53:51.050 --> 00:53:56.130
if I move this a little bit,
the cart doesn't have to move.

00:53:56.130 --> 00:53:59.870
This going back and forth
accounts for x1 relative

00:53:59.870 --> 00:54:00.780
to this table.

00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:02.279
And the table's the cart.

00:54:02.279 --> 00:54:03.195
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:12.140
PROFESSOR: You mean dynamically
because you're putting forces

00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:12.990
on it?

00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:13.900
Yeah, well it might.

00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:20.370
But that's not-- in a way,
you're asking the question,

00:54:20.370 --> 00:54:24.470
is the cart capable
of moving because you

00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:25.990
put a force in the wheel?

00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:29.250
You move the wheel, which puts
more spring force, which maybe

00:54:29.250 --> 00:54:30.835
that causes the cart to move.

00:54:30.835 --> 00:54:32.320
Yeah, that could happen.

00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:35.580
But that's not
the problem you're

00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:39.100
solving when you're trying to
find the generalized forces.

00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:44.830
You're, in fact, allowing
a single motion at a time.

00:54:44.830 --> 00:54:47.760
So if you're talking
about this motion,

00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:52.080
you have frozen the
motion of the main cart.

00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:54.530
And you figure out what
the consequence of that is.

00:54:54.530 --> 00:54:56.960
It does a little virtual
work because there's a force.

00:54:56.960 --> 00:55:00.600
And you get one of the
generalized forces.

00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:03.760
Then if you move the
cart, you fix the wheel,

00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:05.036
and the whole cart moves.

00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:11.150
But the amount that
this wheel moves

00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:14.140
is exactly equal to the
amount that the cart

00:55:14.140 --> 00:55:19.070
moves because you've now
fixed this relative position.

00:55:19.070 --> 00:55:22.040
And that's where you get
the first-- that's where

00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:25.350
you get the capital Qx term.

00:55:25.350 --> 00:55:30.850
Even know this force F1 is
applied here on the wheel,

00:55:30.850 --> 00:55:34.620
this wheel moves
when the table moves.

00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:39.460
But the table doesn't move
when this relative coordinate

00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:41.650
between the table
and here changes.

00:55:41.650 --> 00:55:42.690
It doesn't have to.

00:55:42.690 --> 00:55:45.370
This is free to move
when the table is frozen.

00:55:45.370 --> 00:55:48.370
Remember we talked about
complete and independent

00:55:48.370 --> 00:55:50.500
coordinates?

00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:57.180
x1 is independent of
capital X. If I freeze x1,

00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:59.360
and I make capital X
change, just the whole thing

00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:00.980
moves like that.

00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:04.320
If I freeze capital
X, x1 can still move.

00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:12.520
So you have to pick
independent coordinates.

00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:13.337
Yeah.

00:56:13.337 --> 00:56:15.348
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
mass of the whole thing

00:56:15.348 --> 00:56:17.097
is much larger than
the mass of the wheel?

00:56:17.097 --> 00:56:18.098
PROFESSOR: Not at all.

00:56:18.098 --> 00:56:21.270
AUDIENCE: Because [INAUDIBLE]
if you have two massed connected

00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:22.978
by a spring, you
pull the first one,

00:56:22.978 --> 00:56:24.442
they kind of pull
each other along.

00:56:24.442 --> 00:56:27.074
So why don't you get the
pull-along effect over here?

00:56:27.074 --> 00:56:28.490
PROFESSOR: That's
a good question.

00:56:28.490 --> 00:56:30.890
It's similar-- it's
essentially the same question

00:56:30.890 --> 00:56:32.710
that Christina asked.

00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:35.310
He asked basically--
let's think about it.

00:56:35.310 --> 00:56:37.030
Let's do a problem like that.

00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:41.440
Let's have two carts and
a spring in between them,

00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:42.565
and they're both on wheels.

00:57:01.090 --> 00:57:03.230
This is a planar motion problem.

00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:05.780
Each of these bodies is
capable in planar motion can

00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:08.460
have x and y and a rotation.

00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:11.990
But because of constraints,
how many degrees of freedom

00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:13.030
does body one have?

00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:18.880
I hear one, right?

00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:20.020
I don't allow it to rotate.

00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:21.680
It's got two wheels.

00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:24.705
I don't allow it to go up
because it's on the ground.

00:57:24.705 --> 00:57:26.919
I only allow it to
move in this direction.

00:57:26.919 --> 00:57:28.210
Same thing to be said for this.

00:57:28.210 --> 00:57:29.310
Only one there.

00:57:29.310 --> 00:57:31.560
How many degrees of freedom
do I have in this problem?

00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:37.555
One for each mass, right?

00:57:37.555 --> 00:57:38.930
So I have two
degrees of freedom.

00:57:38.930 --> 00:57:42.530
How many generalized
coordinates do I need?

00:57:42.530 --> 00:57:47.990
So my generalized coordinate
for this one will be x1,

00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:51.595
and for this one
will be some x2.

00:57:55.900 --> 00:58:14.130
If you're going to do this
problem by Lagrange, and let's

00:58:14.130 --> 00:58:14.740
see.

00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:18.940
Let's put a force now to
get back to your question.

00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:22.220
Let's put a force here on one.

00:58:22.220 --> 00:58:23.120
And we'll call it F1.

00:58:27.490 --> 00:58:45.375
And the potential
energy-- actually, no, I

00:58:45.375 --> 00:58:46.558
don't want to do that.

00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:09.630
So the potential energy
for this is some 1/2k times

00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:12.060
the amount that you
stretch the springs, right?

00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:18.030
So you're going to-- the
difference between x1 and x2

00:59:18.030 --> 00:59:20.210
minus the unstretched length.

00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:26.300
So x1 minus x2 minus
the unstretched length.

00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:28.810
We'll call it l0.

00:59:28.810 --> 00:59:33.450
So this would be the
stretch of the springs.

00:59:33.450 --> 00:59:37.120
If the spring had
no length, then it

00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:41.640
would just be the difference
in these two positions squared.

00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:44.781
So my potential energy
looks something like that.

00:59:44.781 --> 00:59:46.280
Now we want to
compute the general--

00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:48.124
and you could use
Lagrange, and you

00:59:48.124 --> 00:59:49.790
could figure out two
equations of motion

00:59:49.790 --> 00:59:52.626
for this taking
your derivatives.

00:59:52.626 --> 00:59:54.000
But the point of
the question was

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:57.840
about getting to the
generalized forces, right?

00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:08.100
So now the generalized
force Qx1 delta x1

01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:18.610
is F1 times the derivative of
R1 with respect to x1 delta x1.

01:00:18.610 --> 01:00:21.480
So how much does
the position vector

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:27.120
from marking the position of
this cart, which would be R1--

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:31.400
so R1 is in effect x1, right?

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:32.930
It's a pretty trivial problem.

01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:36.300
So the derivative of R1 with
respect to x1 is just 1,

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:39.750
and the amount that it
then moves is delta x1.

01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:44.910
So the virtual work done by
this force on that first cart

01:00:44.910 --> 01:00:52.070
is just Qx1 equals F1.

01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:55.190
That's the generalized
force caused

01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:57.480
by this first mass on the cart.

01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:59.885
What's the generalize force Qx2?

01:01:04.310 --> 01:01:09.830
Well, it's some F1.

01:01:09.830 --> 01:01:13.040
Actually, there's a dot here.

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:26.870
This would be some x2 with
respect to x1 delta x1.

01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:31.220
But how much does
x2 move when you

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:34.510
cause a little
virtual deflection

01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:47.460
of-- the virtual
work done if I cause

01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:50.310
a little deflection
of this one is

01:01:50.310 --> 01:01:53.800
equal to the summation
of the forces that

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:56.040
act through delta x2.

01:01:56.040 --> 01:02:02.820
Now, if you move this
a little delta x1 here,

01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:08.120
we figured out that that
Qx1, the generalized force

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:10.910
due to that, is indeed this.

01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:14.380
But what's the generalized
force associated

01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:16.520
with motion delta x2?

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:20.060
Let's move this one
now a little bit.

01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:23.588
When you move that a little
bit, how much work does F1 do?

01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:32.430
So we need to get two
equations of motion, right?

01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:36.070
And you're going to get
1 by taking derivatives

01:02:36.070 --> 01:02:40.530
with respect to coordinate x1.

01:02:40.530 --> 01:02:45.630
You're going to get an
equation of motion, which--

01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:49.920
so EOM x1 associated
with x1 double dot

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:56.440
here is going to have on the
right hand side some Qx1.

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:57.990
And we figured out what that is.

01:02:57.990 --> 01:02:59.830
It's just F1.

01:02:59.830 --> 01:03:02.800
And we're going to get a second
equation of motion associated

01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:05.630
with x2 double dot,
the mass acceleration

01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:07.410
of the mass of the second one.

01:03:07.410 --> 01:03:11.585
And it's going to be equal
to some external forces.

01:03:11.585 --> 01:03:13.210
And there's other
terms in here, right?

01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:15.450
We have kx.

01:03:15.450 --> 01:03:19.191
You have your k terms
and so forth in here.

01:03:19.191 --> 01:03:21.690
But on the right hand side are
the external non-conservative

01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:22.190
forces.

01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:25.110
So are there any
non-conservative forces

01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:26.760
on the second mass?

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:27.260
None.

01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:32.670
So what do you expect Qx2 to be?

01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:43.610
So to get back to your
point, when you're

01:03:43.610 --> 01:03:47.320
computing the
generalized forces,

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:50.650
you freeze all of the
movements except one

01:03:50.650 --> 01:03:52.380
and figure out the work done.

01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:56.370
Even though in the
real system, force

01:03:56.370 --> 01:03:59.782
will result in
this whole system--

01:03:59.782 --> 01:04:01.490
that whole system will
move to the right.

01:04:01.490 --> 01:04:04.580
If I put a steady
force F1 on there,

01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:06.810
the whole system will go
off to the right hand side.

01:04:06.810 --> 01:04:10.500
That would be the solution
to the equations of motion

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:12.000
that you end up with.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.790
But for the purpose of
computing the generalized force

01:04:16.790 --> 01:04:22.470
on each mass, you only
fix where the masses

01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:24.810
are at some instant in time.

01:04:24.810 --> 01:04:27.380
And then one
coordinate at a time

01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:28.930
cause a little
virtual deflection

01:04:28.930 --> 01:04:31.650
and figure out how
much work gets done.

01:04:31.650 --> 01:04:35.480
So see the distinction
between the solution

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:37.060
to the full equation to motion?

01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:37.600
Yes, indeed.

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:39.940
Everything's going to move
because of that force.

01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:41.550
And a little bit
of work that gets

01:04:41.550 --> 01:04:45.690
done due to the motion of
just one coordinate and then

01:04:45.690 --> 01:04:52.370
the other coordinate through all
of the non-conservative forces

01:04:52.370 --> 01:04:55.150
that are applied.

01:04:55.150 --> 01:04:57.110
Did that get to your question?

01:04:57.110 --> 01:04:59.398
All right.

01:04:59.398 --> 01:05:07.410
Now, I'll set up-- I don't think
I'll have time to finish this.

01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:21.410
So last time we had this
problem, this is this rod.

01:05:21.410 --> 01:05:24.410
It's got a sleeve,
and it's got a spring.

01:05:24.410 --> 01:05:27.760
And we figured out the potential
and kinetic energy equation

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:28.720
to motion.

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:30.191
This is a planar motion problem.

01:05:30.191 --> 01:05:30.690
It pivots.

01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:35.220
Thing can slide up and down.

01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:39.420
Requires an angle
theta and a deflection

01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:43.360
x with respect to the rod.

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:46.610
And we figured out t
and v, and we found

01:05:46.610 --> 01:05:49.810
the equations of motion for it.

01:05:49.810 --> 01:05:53.230
So here's my system.

01:05:53.230 --> 01:06:15.130
Point A here, spring,
sleeve, theta, x1, y1.

01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:27.450
And the distance x1 was
measured from here to G,

01:06:27.450 --> 01:06:28.510
to the center of mass.

01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:32.425
That's x1.

01:06:35.730 --> 01:06:38.030
This is in the direction here.

01:06:38.030 --> 01:06:42.730
This is the i1 unit
vector direction.

01:06:42.730 --> 01:06:45.940
And the coordinate
system is my x1, y1.

01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:50.180
So x1, it's down
the axis like that.

01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:56.270
And this problem is a
planar motion problem.

01:06:56.270 --> 01:07:00.180
There's two rigid bodies,
the rod and the sleeve.

01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:02.850
And we can completely describe
the motion of the system

01:07:02.850 --> 01:07:05.890
with it has two
degrees of freedom.

01:07:05.890 --> 01:07:08.480
Theta defines the
position of the rod,

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:11.170
and x1 defines the position
of the sleeve on the rod.

01:07:11.170 --> 01:07:13.100
So we have two
degrees of freedom.

01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:16.610
And when we work
this out, we end up

01:07:16.610 --> 01:07:20.050
with two equations of motion.

01:07:20.050 --> 01:07:24.690
And this was called M2.

01:07:24.690 --> 01:07:25.380
This was M1.

01:07:30.390 --> 01:07:34.140
So one equation of
motion was M2 x1 double

01:07:34.140 --> 01:08:15.780
dot That was one
equation of motion.

01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:19.300
And I'm just leaving
the generalized force

01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:21.529
out of this for a minute.

01:08:21.529 --> 01:08:22.384
We'll figure it out.

01:08:22.384 --> 01:08:23.800
And the second
equation of motion.

01:08:34.258 --> 01:08:35.752
This is the rod.

01:09:16.670 --> 01:09:19.410
So you get two
equations of motion.

01:09:19.410 --> 01:09:21.630
We worked it out in
the last lecture.

01:09:21.630 --> 01:09:27.010
And we can see this
accounts for the mass moment

01:09:27.010 --> 01:09:29.250
inertia of the rod,
mass moment of inertia

01:09:29.250 --> 01:09:33.910
of the sleeve with respect to
G. So parallel axis theorem

01:09:33.910 --> 01:09:36.479
adds another piece to it.

01:09:36.479 --> 01:09:38.680
The whole thing,
theta double dot.

01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:41.090
And then this is
just due to gravity,

01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:44.560
gravity acting on the rod,
gravity acting on the sleeve.

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:46.109
And on the right
hand side, you need

01:09:46.109 --> 01:09:50.439
to get these Qx, your
generalized forces

01:09:50.439 --> 01:09:54.130
for generalized coordinate
x1 and generalized

01:09:54.130 --> 01:09:55.850
coordinate theta.

01:09:55.850 --> 01:10:00.540
So we did it, in fact
worked it out last time

01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:02.970
doing the intuitive approach.

01:10:02.970 --> 01:10:08.670
And what if we were
to try to do this then

01:10:08.670 --> 01:10:11.890
by the kinematic approach
that I described here?

01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:25.330
The force was applied here.

01:10:25.330 --> 01:10:26.450
It was horizontal.

01:10:26.450 --> 01:10:29.626
We called it F2 because it
was applied to mass two.

01:10:37.930 --> 01:10:40.810
And in order to
use this technique,

01:10:40.810 --> 01:10:42.940
we want now to compute Qx1.

01:10:50.880 --> 01:11:02.950
We have a force F2, and
it is in the-- which

01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:05.890
way do I want to do it?

01:11:05.890 --> 01:11:07.203
We'll have an inertial system.

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:28.170
So we need to describe a
vector in-- I better not

01:11:28.170 --> 01:11:30.650
draw it out here.

01:11:30.650 --> 01:11:32.660
So I'll just set
this problem up,

01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:34.670
and we'll finish it next time.

01:11:34.670 --> 01:11:41.210
I have an inertial
system y and x.

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:46.520
So that in this
system, this force

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:52.550
would be F2 capital J
dotted with the derivative

01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:58.970
of some vector that
runs here to this point.

01:11:58.970 --> 01:12:04.470
And I'll call that R2 in o.

01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:13.350
So the derivative of R2
with respect to x1 delta x1.

01:12:16.731 --> 01:12:21.840
And if you can work this
out, then you're done.

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:25.830
The key to this is
figuring out what is R2,

01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:28.990
and doing it in
unit vectors such

01:12:28.990 --> 01:12:30.930
that you can complete
this dot product.

01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:42.330
So how would you describe
what is this position to here,

01:12:42.330 --> 01:12:46.770
and what are its unit
vectors that break it down?

01:12:46.770 --> 01:12:50.560
Take this R2, and you
express it in terms

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:57.300
of unit vectors in the inertial
capital I capital J system.

01:12:57.300 --> 01:13:01.590
And once you've done that,
you can take the derivative,

01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:05.600
dot it with that,
and you're done.

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.019
So we'll finish that next time.

01:13:07.019 --> 01:13:09.060
You might go off and think
about it in your notes

01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:09.640
from last time.

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:10.806
We already figured this out.

01:13:10.806 --> 01:13:12.910
We just did it
the intuitive way.

01:13:12.910 --> 01:13:15.420
Drew the F and figured out
which part's in the direction

01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:18.980
of x1, which part's in the
direction of delta theta.

01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:19.900
And we figured it out.

01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:21.770
So you actually already
have the answer.

01:13:21.770 --> 01:13:24.390
So go see if you can do that.
