00:00:00.244 --> 00:00:01.694
(whooshing sound)

00:00:01.694 --> 00:00:02.705
(lively music)

00:00:02.705 --> 00:00:06.634
Salman: So notice that when
the X term was positive,

00:00:06.634 --> 00:00:10.619
our hyperbola opened to
the right and the left.

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:14.698
Voiceover: Sal Khan is the CEO of
nonprofit on-demand educational resource,

00:00:14.698 --> 00:00:15.999
Khan Academy.

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:21.252
He started making educational videos
and compatible practice software in 2004

00:00:21.252 --> 00:00:26.134
for his cousins, that offer lessons and
many levels of mathematics and science,

00:00:26.134 --> 00:00:27.785
and they became viral,

00:00:27.785 --> 00:00:29.894
with many more people turning to him

00:00:29.894 --> 00:00:33.919
and asking him to create even more
lessons in a variety of areas.

00:00:33.919 --> 00:00:36.261
Now, he is doing it full time,

00:00:36.261 --> 00:00:41.366
and Khan Academy is a designated
Forbes Name You Need To Know in 2011.

00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:45.060
A recent blog post on Khan's
new approach to education,

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.991
which takes the lectures
out of the classroom,

00:00:46.991 --> 00:00:49.710
leaving more room for
project-based learning at school,

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.091
sparked quite the conversation online.

00:00:52.091 --> 00:00:53.330
Salman: Bruce Upbin brings up the point

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.375
that there is not a chance on Khan
Academy to ask follow-up questions.

00:00:56.375 --> 00:00:58.510
I think, at least the
way I think about it is,

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.454
let's say you have a question,
and you're doing calculus,

00:01:00.454 --> 00:01:02.188
you have a question on limits.

00:01:02.188 --> 00:01:03.517
There is a video on limits,

00:01:03.517 --> 00:01:05.945
and you can go back and you can
click that 10-minute video on limits,

00:01:05.945 --> 00:01:07.109
and just the act of that is, like,

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.522
"You know what?

00:01:07.522 --> 00:01:08.671
"I don't understand limits.

00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:10.654
"Can you explain a
little bit more on that?"

00:01:10.654 --> 00:01:11.377
And if you're still stuck,

00:01:11.377 --> 00:01:12.562
if you don't even know how to navigate

00:01:12.562 --> 00:01:16.097
or know what you should be looking
at to answer your question,

00:01:16.097 --> 00:01:17.345
we have a pretty vibrant community.

00:01:17.345 --> 00:01:19.938
We have a million users a month.

00:01:19.938 --> 00:01:22.352
So to Bruce's second point
about hands-on learning,

00:01:22.352 --> 00:01:24.024
it's a completely fair point.

00:01:24.024 --> 00:01:25.685
And I think what Khan Academy enables

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:28.291
is more time in the classroom
for actual hands-on learning.

00:01:28.291 --> 00:01:30.400
The students are getting the
lecture at home at their own pace.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.398
They can remediate if they need to.

00:01:32.398 --> 00:01:34.647
And now they can go to the classroom
and do project-based learning

00:01:34.647 --> 00:01:36.063
and spend more time with the professor.

00:01:36.063 --> 00:01:38.710
To Kerckhoff's point about
taking a relationship

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.500
or connection with the teacher
to really get deep understanding,

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.392
I think that's true.

00:01:43.392 --> 00:01:46.623
I think we'd be very optimistic
if we think a lot of the students

00:01:46.623 --> 00:01:49.988
are getting that deep intimate
connection in the classroom right now.

00:01:49.988 --> 00:01:51.530
I think most students aren't.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.885
And to some degree, and even though
it is virtual, it is strange,

00:01:53.885 --> 00:01:56.497
but I get a lot of feedback
from a lot of users

00:01:56.497 --> 00:01:58.799
that they feel a deep
intimate connection with me,

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.931
that I feel like their
neighbor or their older brother

00:02:00.931 --> 00:02:04.374
and that I'm sitting next
to them at the kitchen table

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:05.133
teaching them math.

00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:07.122
I love Christopher Helman's point,

00:02:07.122 --> 00:02:09.780
and I'm glad I was able to help his wife.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.303
To his point about replacing universities,

00:02:11.303 --> 00:02:13.904
I don't think that's going
to happen anytime soon,

00:02:13.904 --> 00:02:16.411
but I think it's an interesting idea.

00:02:16.411 --> 00:02:17.361
I think to think about that,

00:02:17.361 --> 00:02:19.165
we have to realize that a
university is two things:

00:02:19.165 --> 00:02:21.515
It's a credential and it's learning.

00:02:21.515 --> 00:02:25.885
I think Khan Academy is
going to be able to really

00:02:25.885 --> 00:02:29.539
change how the learning part is
done in a pretty significant way.

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:33.759
The credentialing part, getting your
degree from Stanford or Harvard,

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:35.693
that will probably be
there for a little while.

00:02:35.693 --> 00:02:38.575
I think if you fast
forward 10 years from now,

00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:40.175
I mean it's not going to happen overnight,

00:02:40.175 --> 00:02:41.828
I mean this is a social change happening,

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:43.664
10 years, 20 years,

00:02:43.664 --> 00:02:47.623
I think an employer would rather see
your log from a site like Khan Academy,

00:02:47.623 --> 00:02:51.098
where it doesn't just get
a 3.2 GPA in psychology,

00:02:51.098 --> 00:02:53.161
it gets what you did, when you did it,

00:02:53.161 --> 00:02:55.661
how well you did it, how well
were you able to help your peers,

00:02:55.661 --> 00:02:57.166
how consistently did you work.

00:02:57.166 --> 00:03:00.662
"Wow, this guy worked three hours
everyday for 20 years on this stuff."

00:03:00.662 --> 00:03:04.092
"This is a persistent kind of
guy that I want working for me,"

00:03:04.092 --> 00:03:05.796
and we'll be able to give
people that type of analytics.

00:03:05.796 --> 00:03:08.649
I think that could be a
more powerful transcript

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:11.175
than just a high-level degree right now.

00:03:11.267 --> 23:59:59.999
(whooshing sound)
