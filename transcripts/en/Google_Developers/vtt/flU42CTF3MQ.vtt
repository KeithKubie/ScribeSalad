00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.910
JASON TITUS: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.360
I'm Jason, and it's great to be
back here at I/O. This morning,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.110
you got to hear all
about what we're doing

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.300
for our billions of users.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.270
Now I'm excited to share what
we're doing for all of you--

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.940
the developers who are
solving everyday problems

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.170
in powerful ways.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.230
Whether you're joining
us here at Shoreline

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.765
or watching via the
livestream or joining us

00:00:37.765 --> 00:00:42.460
through one of 500 I/O
Extended events, welcome.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.750
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.945
One of the reasons
I love my job is

00:00:50.945 --> 00:00:53.030
that I get to meet with
developers from all

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.580
around the world and
hear what you're up to

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.360
and what you're
finding difficult.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.530
It helps me understand
what we need

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.650
to do as Google to
make things easier,

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.230
as well as what we can do
better in our own products.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.470
And one thing that
becomes instantly clear,

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.250
from Lagos to Warsaw to
Jakarta, is how important

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.840
the broader
development community

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.330
is in helping each
other figure out things

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.060
and solve problems together.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.010
This kind of
pay-it-forward culture--

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.680
it's one of the great things
about working in this industry.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.460
And I am constantly inspired
by the stories I hear out

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.130
of our Google Developer groups
and Google Developer experts

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.225
solving this [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:35.550
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.270
I see we have a few
of them here today.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.850
Every year, with
their help, we're

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.130
able to reach more than
one million developers

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.270
through in-person events
across 140 countries.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.830
And our Women
Techmakers program is

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.982
able to engage more than 100,000
women advance their careers

00:01:56.982 --> 00:01:57.966
each year.

00:01:57.966 --> 00:02:00.918
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:00.918 --> 00:02:04.410
Our developer community
is truly important to us.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.550
And all of this would not be
possible without their efforts.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.100
It's also great that
in the last two years,

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.420
we have had the number of
Google Developer experts double.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.440
These are amazing people,
like Rayan Al Zahab.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.625
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.480
She both founded her local
Google Developer Group

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.510
and Women Techmakers Lebanon.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.330
On top of that, she started
a web development training

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.320
program for Lebanese and
Syrian refugee girls.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.710
We also have folks like Rebecca
Franks, an IoT and Android

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:40.680
expert in Johannesburg.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.010
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.610
Out of her passion for
cultural preservation,

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.590
she works on an
open source app that

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.910
lets children read books in
their native African languages.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.770
Google would not
be what it is today

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.470
if it weren't for developers
like Rayan, Rebecca,

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.680
and all of you.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.094
So thank you.

00:03:01.094 --> 00:03:04.391
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:06.275 --> 00:03:10.430
As you heard this morning,
Sundar was calling out--

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.270
the pace of AI innovation
is breathtaking.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.950
A whole new set of
capabilities is going

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.994
to change the way we do things.

00:03:17.994 --> 00:03:19.910
And what's really exciting
to me is that we're

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.570
at an inflection point.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.100
AI used to be something that
only deep experts and PhDs

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.490
could use, and now it's
becoming accessible to everyone.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.934
Let me show you what I mean.

00:03:31.934 --> 00:03:32.600
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.310
- I would totally
describe myself

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.780
as an average high schooler.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.660
I like hanging out with my
friends, watching movies,

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.670
getting my nails
done, and lately I've

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.720
been into machine learning using
convolutional neural networks.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.760
I don't know why
you're laughing at me.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.807
- Since childhood, she's always
wanted to know everything.

00:03:49.807 --> 00:03:50.390
- Why is that?

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:51.200
How is that?

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.980
What does it do?

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.250
She just wants to be
always learning, moving,

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.900
doing different stuff.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.050
- I haven't always been
into computer science,

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.610
but my mom grows rose
bushes in my front yard.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.830
Every season, they'd get
disease, and then my mom

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.163
and I would have to diagnose it.

00:04:05.163 --> 00:04:08.660
- Knowing Shaza, she wanted
to do something about it.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.850
- I had the idea as
a potential thing

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.730
I could do for my research
class with Miss Son.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.180
- Why anyone would sit around
their summer vacation teaching

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.560
a machine to identify plants--

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.130
not sure, but that was
what she wanted to do.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.730
- I wanted to have a way people
could diagnose plant diseases

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.550
just by taking a photo of it.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.120
And so that's when I started
looking into TensorFlow.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.770
I'd watch different
tutorials and read blog posts

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:33.580
every night.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.590
- Shaza took it upon herself
to do all the background

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.130
research necessary and then
start to ask, what can this

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.170
really do?

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.630
- PlantMD works when a user
takes a picture of the plant,

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.190
and it tells you
what plant it is

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.960
and whether it's
healthy or diseased.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.030
And if it is diseased,
what disease it is.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.220
- My first question
was, is it an app

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.570
that's only on your phone?

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.100
And she's like, no.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.800
Somebody has downloaded
this app and using it.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.350
That was, like, wow.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.780
Something that I
just was so proud.

00:05:08.846 --> 00:05:10.720
- I don't think you have
to be a super genius

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.950
to get into coding.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.500
Really anyone can do it with
an idea and with perseverance.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.140
I feel like open
source technology

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.660
and the wealth of
information on the internet

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.850
is empowering my generation.

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.890
I know that I can do
anything I put my mind to,

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.290
and so can anybody else.

00:05:29.077 --> 00:05:29.660
[END PLAYBACK]

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:30.826
JASON TITUS: Amazing, right?

00:05:30.826 --> 00:05:33.783
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.610
And we're delighted to
have Shaza and her family

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:38.401
here with us today.

00:05:38.401 --> 00:05:41.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:48.467 --> 00:05:50.550
So you can see why we're
so excited about bringing

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.540
technology like TensorFlow
and ML Kit to all of you.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.840
As developers, you can drop
modules into your applications,

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.670
add a few lines of
code, and give them

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.130
intelligent new capabilities.

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.280
And this is only the
beginning of what is possible.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.430
As a company, we're committed
to empowering developers

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.030
with the latest technology
to build things that matter.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.620
And today, we'll
show you what we're

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.760
doing to make that easier.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.460
So over the next
hour, we're going

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.005
to talk more about new
capabilities we're releasing,

00:06:20.005 --> 00:06:22.380
as well as the improvements
we're making to the platforms

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.780
and tools you use every day.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.600
So with that, let's
get started with Steph,

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.516
who's going to tell you
the latest on Android.

00:06:28.516 --> 00:06:31.281
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.240
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON: Android
is growing all over the world

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.230
with billions of devices, and
every month, billions of apps

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:45.400
downloaded.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.500
Our developer community
is growing rapidly,

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.970
right alongside.

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:52.120
In China, India,
Brazil, the number

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.270
of developers using
our IDE almost

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.480
tripled in just two years.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.150
With all this growth,
we feel a responsibility

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.130
to support this vast ecosystem.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:08.350
And listen, if you feel
like your feedback drives

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:12.760
what we say here each
year, you are right,

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.380
like Kotlin last year.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.726
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.150
Since we made it a
fully-supported language,

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.480
we've launched more and more
support, taking advantage

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.950
throughout Android.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:32.410
Already, 35% of pro
developers use Kotlin.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.540
That number grows every month.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:39.790
And 95% of Kotlin users
say they're really happy.

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:41.170
More and more
Android development

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:42.820
is going towards Kotlin.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:46.250
We are committed
for the long term.

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:49.280
And if you haven't
tried it, I would.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.620
Just as your feedback
shaped investments so far,

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:56.210
like Play Console, Android
Studio, and Kotlin,

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:58.310
your feedback shaped
this year, too.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:00.990
So let's cover
three things today.

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:04.970
First, distribution-- making
apps radically smaller

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:07.100
so you get more installs.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.290
Second, development--
helping you

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:12.500
build faster, with better APIs.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:16.040
And third, engagement-- bringing
users back more and more.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.320
Let's go straight
into driving installs.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.850
So Android is growing.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:20.800
That's great.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.620
App size is also growing,
and that is not great.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.570
Apps are targeting more
people and more countries,

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:32.360
which means APKs have more
languages, more features.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:36.440
The larger your app gets,
the less installs you get.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.470
And most people think that's
an emerging markets issue,

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:42.330
but it's true in all countries.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:46.850
So how can we make it easier
to build smaller apps?

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:50.630
Our best idea was hard for us.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:55.310
It meant re-architecting our
entire app-serving stack.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:58.640
But it was the
right way to do it.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.400
Today, we are excited
to announce the new app

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.110
model for Android.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:06.050
Using the Android App Bundle,
a new publishing format,

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:08.600
you can dramatically
reduce app size.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.140
Apps need a lot of resources
to work on every device.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:15.380
The bundle contains it
all, but modularized.

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:19.820
So when you download, Google
Play's new dynamic delivery

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.330
only delivers the code and
resources a specific device

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:24.350
needs.

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:26.760
Now, we've tested
this with many of you,

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.010
and we've seen huge savings.

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.760
LinkedIn saved 23%.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.070
Twitter saved 35%.

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:36.420
[INAUDIBLE] saved 50%.

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:40.010
Now, if you're wondering, how
many devices does that work on?

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:41.610
The answer is 99%.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.720
And that's because it's built on
long-standing platform concepts

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.120
like splits and multi-APK.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.840
We also wanted this to be
almost no work for you.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.810
And so I'd love to have you
see a demo from someone who's

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:59.300
been instrumental, along with
several teams who built this

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.080
together.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.924
Please welcome Tor.

00:10:01.924 --> 00:10:03.780
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:06.090
TOR NORBYE: Thank you, Steph.

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:08.300
So here I am, in Android
Studio, working on my app.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.050
And I'd like to make it smaller.

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:12.350
So what I'll do is open
up our APK Analyzer.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:18.350
And as you can see, most of the
download size is for resources.

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.080
We have several
large image folders

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.184
with different densities.

00:10:21.184 --> 00:10:22.600
So this is an app
which can really

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:26.080
benefit from the new
dynamic delivery facility.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.650
To use it, I don't have to
change a single line of code.

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:33.460
All I have to do is rebuild
my app as an app bundle.

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.460
So I'll invoke the
Generate APK dialog.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:39.160
As you can see, we have a new
Android App Bundle option.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.680
Next, I point to my
KeyStore, and I can also

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.890
tell it to export my
encryption key for Google Play.

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:47.770
This is what lets the Play
store break apart my app

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:51.010
and reassemble it
into smaller versions.

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:52.931
So then I'll trigger the build.

00:10:52.931 --> 00:10:55.180
And once that's done, we can
take a look at the bundle

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.410
file we just created.

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:00.116
So as you can see, this
looks just like the APK files

00:11:00.116 --> 00:11:02.740
that you already know and love,
but there's some extra metadata

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:06.280
here, which is what lets
the Play store do its magic.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.380
So now, in the interest
of time, let's assume

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:10.555
that I've already uploaded
my app bundle and my sign

00:11:10.555 --> 00:11:12.730
in key to the Play Console.

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:14.680
So then I land here.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.830
We have a new page in the Play
Console called the App Bundle

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:18.820
Explorer.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.770
Take a look at the big
number on the right.

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:23.170
This tells me that when
I publish this update,

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:27.580
I'm going to save nearly 29%
on downloads for my users.

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:31.570
And this page lets me drill
into just how that's possible.

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:34.180
So in short, creating Android
app bundles with Studio

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:35.830
is super easy, and
I hope you'll all

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:39.430
try it out and see similar gains
for yourselves and your users.

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:42.300
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON: And
all this is available now.

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.950
App bundles and dynamic
delivery are launching

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:47.110
for production use today.

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:50.526
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:55.610
Now, we're also working
to increase installs

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:56.750
in other ways.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.210
At GDC, we announced
Google Play Instant.

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:02.810
So you can try a game
without having to install.

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:06.350
Now, games who have adopted
this have increased the number

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:08.630
of players by up to 20%.

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:12.320
Today, we're announcing that
this is available for all game

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.100
developers.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.020
If you want to try
it right now, try

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:19.410
launching "Candy Crush Saga,"
because that launches today.

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:21.140
And to make development
easier, we're

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:26.739
also releasing a Unity
plugin and Cocos integration.

00:12:26.739 --> 00:12:28.280
Now let's dive into
our second theme,

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.580
making app development easier.

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:34.040
Android's APIs could be easier.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.400
One person said,
on Android, there's

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.080
six ways to do everything.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.390
Last year, we launched
Architecture Components.

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:44.300
It was a testbed for
new ideas, starting

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:48.710
in top areas that you flagged,
like life cycles and data.

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:52.110
Today, so many top apps
use these in production.

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:54.140
And more than half
of you have said

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:58.110
you already use them or
plan to in the next year.

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:02.420
Today, we're announcing Android
Jetpack, the next generation

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:05.810
of Android APIs to accelerate
Android development.

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:09.320
Jetpack is a set of
libraries and tools.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:13.400
We set the basic DNA by
including support library

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.690
and architecture components.

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:17.060
Jetpack brings these
together coherently

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:21.500
and adds even more new
libraries, work management,

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:26.540
navigation, paging, slices,
and Kotlin extensions

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.700
across everything.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.650
All libraries are
backwards-compatible,

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:36.210
which means they work
on 95% of devices.

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:38.600
So it's been a pain to
schedule background tasks.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:42.920
Now, with Work Manager, you
get a single, easy-to-use API

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:46.130
that works nearly everywhere.

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:48.916
And Jetpack is all
about concise APIs.

00:13:48.916 --> 00:13:50.540
Those of you who've
tried it say you're

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:53.070
writing up to 1/3 less code.

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:55.850
Jetpack and Kotlin
are intentionally

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:58.100
designed to work
together so you write

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:02.060
only the code you need for a
pleasant reading and writing

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:03.410
experience.

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:07.340
And Jetpack saves time by
embodying opinions about what

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:11.390
we found works best for Android
development, like RxJava

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:14.150
or material design.

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:17.300
Jetpack's APIs are
integrated with the IDE, too.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:21.920
For instance, Android Studio
now includes a Navigation Editor

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.990
which works with the library.

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:26.360
So you can visualize
your app flow,

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.820
almost like you're
sketching on a whiteboard.

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:31.670
You can add new screens,
position them in your flow.

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.170
And under the covers,
we'll help you

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:35.990
manage the back stack,
conditional flows until you

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:37.970
get it just right.

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:39.170
Overall--

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:42.439
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:48.010
--IDE tools, we think,
are great helpers

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:50.120
to make development fast.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:54.490
That's why everything you've
seen bundles using Jetpack

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:56.500
comes with Studio support.

00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:00.400
And the team also works on
making everyday tasks faster.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.240
You told us, work on
emulator boot time,

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.680
and I'd like you to see it now.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.180
TOR NORBYE: All
right, so first, let

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.540
me show you how quickly
our emulator can start now.

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.361
Ready, set, go.

00:15:13.361 --> 00:15:14.860
As you can see,
it's nearly instant.

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:16.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:17.830
I was not cheating.

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:19.940
It was not running
in the background.

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.350
The reason it's so fast is
that we support snapshots.

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:24.100
So we store the full
state of the emulator

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.290
into a file that we can
then load back quickly.

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:28.422
And you can create these
snapshots yourself.

00:15:28.422 --> 00:15:30.130
So now I'm going to
bring back a snapshot

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:34.180
I took in the middle of a
complex OpenGL 3D stress test.

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:36.960
Ready, set, go.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.740
So you can see it's
about two seconds,

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.635
and it's up and running.

00:15:41.635 --> 00:15:44.010
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON: There
are more speed enhancements.

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:47.560
We added an energy profiler,
integrated an improved system

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:48.070
trace.

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:50.590
There's a C++ profiler now.

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:53.530
We promoted D8
compiler to stable

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:56.470
after testing it on our
own Android platform, which

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:59.320
means smaller, faster
binaries by default.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.770
And we added an ADB Connection
Assistant to fix, hey, why

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:04.790
can't I connect to that device?

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:07.870
So that's Android development--
faster and easier.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:11.180
We hope you try Android Studio
and Jetpack previews today,

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.900
including all the alpha
stage new libraries.

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:17.810
Jetpack is just a
beginning for us.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:20.510
We are testing so
many more new ideas,

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:23.750
and we hope you watch for
them in the months ahead.

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:26.030
OK, so once your app is
built, it's installed,

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:28.060
we want to get
users coming back.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.590
The slices Dave showed
are a cool new way

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:32.300
to drive reengagement.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.670
We wanted these to
be easy to build.

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:37.220
So you'll find templates
that are rich and flexible

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.140
so you can compose.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:40.820
You can start with
something simple,

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.490
like a set of rows or grids.

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:47.120
Then you can add content,
like text and images.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.190
But not just static
content, you can also

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:52.220
house real-time data
and rich controls.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.280
And once you get the pieces
together in a good setup,

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.860
you can add the code to
make slices interactive,

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.830
like pause a song or
go to the next one.

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:04.500
So then you end up with this
cool mini-snippet of your app.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:10.130
And because it's Jetpack,
slices work on 95% of devices,

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:12.740
showing the power of building
new features in a Jetpack

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:13.520
world.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:17.190
This is also ready for
everyone here to try today.

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:19.940
Your slices will start showing
up in Search this summer,

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:24.530
timed with the P launch, and
Assistant later this year.

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:27.190
So that's a quick tour of
some of the biggest new areas

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:30.010
of investment for Android
and how your feedback

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:32.290
has been shaping the landscape.

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:35.860
Now let's switch gears and
talk about cool devices.

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:40.390
At CES this year, we announced
that Lenovo, Harman, LG,

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:44.260
and iHome are all building
consumer products powered

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.210
by Android Things--

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:49.990
a powerful platform for
developing IoT products.

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:52.750
This week, Android
Things graduates

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:55.840
from developer preview to
1.0, ready for everyone

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.120
to build commercial devices.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:02.980
And everyone here at I/O will
get a free Android Things

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:04.000
developer kit.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.304
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:14.910
If you want to get it first,
join the scavenger hunt today,

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:18.720
or everyone here can
pick one up tomorrow.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:23.310
As we continue to expand to
more devices and more surfaces,

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:25.500
our team and the
Assistant team have

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.540
been working closely together.

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:31.632
To hear more, please
welcome Brad Abrams.

00:18:31.632 --> 00:18:35.006
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:39.526 --> 00:18:40.400
BRAD ABRAMS: Awesome.

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.440
Thanks, Steph.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:45.950
This morning, you heard how the
Assistant is becoming even more

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:50.540
conversational and visual,
helping users get things done,

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:53.630
save time, and be more present.

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:57.410
And developers like you have
been a big part of the story,

00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:02.830
making the Assistant more useful
across 500 million devices.

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:06.470
DoorDash, Fitbit, Todoist,
Starbucks, Disney,

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:09.770
and many, many others
are engaging with users

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:11.810
through Actions that they build.

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:17.240
And smart home OEMs like GE,
Arlo, Xiaomi, and Logitech

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.910
have made more
than 5,000 devices

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:22.130
that work with the Assistant.

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:23.810
In total, the
Google Assistant is

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:27.770
ready to help with over one
million Actions built by Google

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:30.020
and all of you.

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:33.680
And the platform's momentum
has been growing every day.

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:38.780
It's now available across 16
languages and multiple devices,

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:44.150
including phones, smart
speakers, TVs, cars, watches,

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:47.390
headphones, and whole
new categories of devices

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:51.070
like smart displays,
which are coming in July.

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:54.020
And we're delighted to
see that many of you

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:58.940
are starting to test the waters
with this new, emerging era

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.370
of conversational computing.

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:04.910
In fact, over half
a million developers

00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:09.860
are learning and building with
Dialogflow, our conversation

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:12.570
development tool.

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:14.820
Today, I'm excited
to share how we're

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:19.740
making it even easier for app
developers and web developers

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:23.410
to get started with
the Google Assistant.

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:27.730
You can think of your
Assistant Action as a companion

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:30.970
experience to your main
property that users

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:35.260
can access from a smart
speaker, even in the car--

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:38.690
wherever they're not using
their phone or laptop.

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:41.650
And if you want to personalize
that Action for users,

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:43.780
account linking lets
you easily share

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:47.860
state between your
app and your Action.

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:51.230
And now, with seamless
digital subscriptions,

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:54.160
your users can enjoy the
content and digital goods

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.500
they purchased in
your Android app

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.800
directly in your
Assistant Action.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.230
Take "The Economist,"
for example.

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:05.500
Because I'm a premium
subscriber in their app,

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.380
I can now enjoy that
same premium content

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:13.030
on any Assistant-enabled device.

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:15.910
But of course, creating
engaging actions

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:19.120
doesn't end with
digital subscriptions.

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.980
As you saw in the
demos this morning,

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:25.720
the Assistant is becoming a
canvas that blends conversation

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:29.890
with rich visual interactions
for the phone and other devices

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:32.270
like smart displays.

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:34.520
And starting today,
you can deeply

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:38.270
customize the appearance
of your Action.

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:41.630
You saw a glimpse of what
was possible earlier today

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:44.690
with demos from
Tasty and Starbucks,

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:46.580
but let me show you another one.

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:51.030
Check out the game "King for a
Day" here on a smart display.

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:56.840
It looks beautiful here, on
the phone, and on the TV.

00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:00.410
Of course, once you build
an Action for the Assistant,

00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:04.700
you want to get lots of people
engaged with that experience.

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:08.950
And for that, I've got
three things to share.

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:11.800
First, we're making
it even easier

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.350
for you to promote your
Action with something

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:17.990
new we call Action Links.

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:19.960
These are hyperlinks
that you can

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:24.440
use from anywhere that point
directly into your Action.

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.380
Let me give you an example.

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:29.380
Headspace has built
a great experience

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:33.100
for the Google Assistant that
can help people meditate.

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.450
Now, when they have
some new content,

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:38.470
they might share a
blog post about it.

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:42.960
This post contains an Action
Link right there at the bottom.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:47.920
And that special link triggers
the Headspace Action directly

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:51.010
in the Google Assistant.

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:52.750
If you've already
built an Action

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:55.600
and you want to spread
the word, starting today,

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:59.320
you can visit the Action Console
to find your shareable Action

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.330
Link.

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:04.990
OK, so now that you've
acquired some new users,

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:07.820
you want to engage them.

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:13.000
And for this, we've got
Action Notifications.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.520
Once users opt in,
Action Notifications

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:19.060
gives you a way to connect
with them about new features

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:20.800
and content.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.110
These notifications
work on the phone,

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:27.130
even if users don't have
your Android app installed.

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:30.010
And now, with
cross-surface notifications

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:31.780
coming to the
Assistant, you'll be

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:35.560
able to reengage with
your users on speakers,

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:40.780
smart displays, and other
Assistant-enabled devices.

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:44.830
But to consistently
reengage with users,

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:48.430
you need to become part
of their daily habits.

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:53.060
And for that, the Assistant
supports routines.

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:56.860
This is the ability to
execute multiple actions

00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:01.490
with a single command for things
like waking up in the morning,

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:05.430
getting to work, or
many other daily tasks.

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:09.650
And now, with
Routine Suggestions,

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:12.860
after somebody engages
with your Action,

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:17.330
you can prompt them to add
your Action to their routine

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:19.200
with just a couple of taps.

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:24.970
So for example, on my
way to work each morning,

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:27.640
my Assistant can tell
me how to beat traffic,

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:31.680
and it can also help me order
my Americano from Starbucks.

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:38.810
We're excited to see how Action
Links, Action Notifications,

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:43.550
and Routine Suggestions will
help you drive engagement.

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:46.550
But the broader challenge
of helping people

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:50.360
connect with the right
Action is reminiscent

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:53.780
of the early days of the web.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:56.900
Over the past 20
years, we've built up

00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:00.200
a lot of experience
in connecting people

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:04.130
with the right information,
services, and content.

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:06.440
And we're putting
that expertise to work

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:08.780
in the Google Assistant.

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:11.990
For example, when somebody
says, hey, Google, let's

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:15.470
start a maps quiz, the
Assistant should immediately

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:18.630
suggest relevant games.

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:21.300
For that to happen,
we need to understand

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:24.480
the user's basic intent.

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.000
And that's hard,
because there are

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.610
thousands of ways that users
could ask to play a game.

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:35.580
To handle this complexity,
we're beginning

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:38.310
to map all the
ways that users can

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:44.320
ask for things into a
taxonomy of built-in intents.

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:48.610
Today, we're making the first
set of those intents available.

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:52.660
And with these, you'll be able
to give the Assistant a deeper

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:56.200
understanding of what
your Action can do.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.540
We'll be rolling out
hundreds of built-in intents

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:01.740
in the coming months.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:05.090
So with that, I'm excited
to see how you all

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:09.170
extend your experiences to the
Google Assistant, how you'll

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:12.860
build rich, immersive
interactions, and create

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:16.490
consistent engagement
for your users.

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:20.060
To learn more and get started
building Actions today,

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:22.850
visit actions.google.com.

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:25.130
And with that, let me introduce
Tal, who will tell you

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:26.330
about the web platform.

00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:26.830
Thank you.

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:30.267
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:37.030
TAL OPPENHEIMER: Thanks, Brad.

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:39.010
I don't think it's
an exaggeration

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:41.320
to say that the
web is the world's

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:43.390
most critical
resource for ensuring

00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:45.850
the free flow of information.

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:50.140
The web is a fundamentally
open and independent platform.

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:52.090
So for developers,
the web makes it

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:56.620
possible to reach users around
the world on almost any device.

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:59.860
And for users, the web
provides a truly frictionless

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:01.030
experience.

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:04.370
You tap on a link
and load a page.

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:06.190
And these properties
have allowed the web

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:10.030
to reach a massive scale,
with over five billion devices

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:12.520
accessing the web each month.

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:14.980
And here at Google, from
the very earliest days

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:18.220
of page rank to building
our very own browser,

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.800
we've been deeply invested
in the continued growth

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.720
and reach of the web.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.580
And as part of this,
we have two main goals.

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:28.000
First, to make the
web platform itself

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.220
more powerful and more capable.

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:33.400
And second, to build
tools to help you easily

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.370
take advantage of this power.

00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:38.200
Over the past few
years on Chrome,

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.270
we've worked alongside
other browsers

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:42.280
to add capabilities
to the platform

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:45.190
to support new web
experiences we've been calling

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:48.460
Progressive Web Apps, or PWAs.

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:52.180
PWAs are websites that take
advantage of modern web

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:55.660
platform APIs to build
experiences that can do things

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:57.850
like work while
the user's offline,

00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:01.540
send push notifications, or be
added directly to a user's home

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:03.130
screen.

00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:06.310
And universally, businesses
that have built PWAs

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:08.650
have seen incredible results.

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:10.360
Take Instagram.

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:13.090
Instagram launched
their PWA last year

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:16.250
to increase their reach to
users with low-end devices.

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:20.130
And they were able to double the
retention of their web users.

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:21.820
Times Internet
has been launching

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:24.340
PWAs across their
products and saw

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:28.810
an 87% increase in time spent
per user for their "Economic

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:30.940
Times" PWA.

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:34.210
And when the Starbucks
team rolled out their PWA,

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:37.750
they doubled their daily
and monthly active users

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:39.340
on their website.

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:43.210
And because the web adapts
seamlessly to different devices

00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:46.090
and platforms, their
mobile PWA also

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:48.800
worked well for their
desktop web audience.

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.530
In fact, they found
that the number

00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:53.140
of orders placed on
the desktop version

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:55.660
has grown to be about equal
to the number of orders

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:58.450
placed on their mobile version.

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:01.540
And it's not just
these businesses.

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:04.250
Across sites that
advertise with Google,

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:06.100
we see an average
mobile conversion rate

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:11.960
boost of 20% when the
site switches to a PWA.

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.810
And we also build many
of our own products

00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:16.030
here at Google as PWAs.

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:19.360
Google Maps launched a
new mobile PWA tailored

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:22.600
to provide a fast and
data-conscious experience,

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:25.450
and Google.com itself is a PWA.

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:28.900
It loads 50% less
JavaScript over the network

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:31.450
and can support features
like retrying search queries

00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:33.580
if you're offline.

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:37.660
And investing in a PWA today
goes further than ever.

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:40.600
Chrome OS now provides
native support

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:43.540
for PWAs, allowing them
to be installed and run

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:46.930
fully integrated and in
their own standalone window.

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:49.750
And we're incredibly
excited that Service Worker,

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:53.410
the underlying new API
that makes PWAs possible,

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:56.410
is now supported on
all major browsers,

00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:59.110
including recently Edge
on Windows and Safari

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:01.810
on both desktop and mobile.

00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:04.510
This is probably the most
important leap forward

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:08.090
for the web in the last decade.

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:11.860
So PWAs have fundamentally
changed what the web can do.

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:14.230
But that's only part of it.

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:17.260
WebAssembly enables websites
to run high-performance,

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:21.430
low-level code written in
languages like C and C++,

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:25.400
and it has broad support
across browsers and devices.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:29.230
And because this code has
access to all of the web's APIs,

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:31.630
WebAssembly enables a
new class of content

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:33.730
to run on the web platform.

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:37.570
As just one example, the
AutoCAD team took a 35-year-old

00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:40.660
codebase-- that's older
than the web itself--

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:42.760
and were able to compile
it to run directly

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:45.670
inside a browser
using WebAssembly.

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:51.310
So now all of the power of
AutoCAD is just a link away.

00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:53.260
So the web platform's
been gaining all these

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:55.480
great new capabilities,
but we want

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.250
to make sure it's easy for
you to take advantage of them.

00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:00.370
So we've been working
on the tools to help.

00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:03.730
Lighthouse is a feature of
Chrome's built-in DevTools

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:06.640
that analyzes your site and
gives you clear guidance

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:09.340
on how you can improve
your user's experience.

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:11.359
Half a million developers
are running Lighthouse

00:31:11.359 --> 00:31:13.900
against their site or as part
of their continuous integration

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:16.870
process, to help avoid
performance regressions,

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:19.630
or even to keep an eye
on the competition.

00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:23.500
And today, we're launching
Lighthouse 3.0, which

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.770
makes Lighthouse's performance
metrics even more precise

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:30.380
and its guidance
even more actionable.

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:32.480
So Lighthouse helps
you understand

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.120
how you can upgrade
your site, but we don't

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:36.669
want to just give you advice.

00:31:36.669 --> 00:31:38.210
We want to give you
the tools to help

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:40.010
make sure any new
sites you build

00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:44.300
are high quality by default.
We started the AMP Project

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:46.220
two years ago to
help make building

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:48.770
fast web pages much easier.

00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:52.370
And I'm happy to share that AMP
is evolving in some big ways.

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:55.550
We're expanding the kinds of
things you can do with AMP.

00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:57.470
We've added a bunch of
features that support

00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:59.780
critical e-commerce
experience in AMP,

00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:03.290
like search auto-complete,
a full-featured date picker,

00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:05.720
and soon, infinite
scrolling lists.

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:08.180
And businesses are
seeing the benefits.

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:13.040
As just one example, Overstock
saw a 36% increase in revenue

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.990
on their AMP pages.

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:17.960
And we've introduced AMP
Stories, an easy-to-use format

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:22.070
for creating immersive
stories on the mobile web.

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:23.810
Now, all AMP content
benefits from

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:26.660
a fast, free,
privacy-preserving cache

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:28.550
that optimizes page loads.

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:31.400
But they've had these
Google.com URLs.

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:35.330
So we're fixing that with a new
standard called web packaging.

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:38.090
This is also the first step
towards our ultimate goal

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:41.240
for any fast,
responsive web content--

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:45.780
to be able to take advantage
of all of the benefits of AMP.

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:48.140
And today, we're
announcing a new way

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:51.080
to take advantage of
all of these tools.

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:54.470
We introduced Chrome OS
almost seven years ago

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:56.780
to showcase the best
of the web and make

00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:59.120
computing accessible to all.

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:01.880
Chromebooks grew
50% this past year,

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:05.390
both units sold and
28-day active users.

00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:08.570
And we've expanded to
tablets and attachables.

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:11.280
But it's not just about
access to technology.

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:14.060
It's also about
access to create it.

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:18.170
And that's why we're expanding
Chrome OS to support developers

00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:21.590
with the ability to securely
run Linux apps on Chrome OS.

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:25.055
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:30.610
So this means that many of
your favorite tools, editors,

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:33.670
and IDEs now work
on Chromebooks.

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:36.430
So starting with the Dev
channel on Pixelbooks,

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:39.130
you can now build for the
web on a platform built

00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:41.080
around the web.

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:43.120
And soon, you'll
even be able to run

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:45.070
Android Studio on Chrome OS.

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:48.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:53.700
So all in all, it's an
incredibly exciting time

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:55.470
to be a web developer.

00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:58.050
Businesses around the
world are consistently

00:33:58.050 --> 00:34:00.600
seeing substantial
returns from deeply

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.160
investing in their
web experience

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.350
by building
progressive web apps.

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:07.800
And the reach of these PWAs
is now truly everywhere,

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.770
with support across
every major browser.

00:34:10.770 --> 00:34:13.830
And it's easier than ever to
build great web experiences

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:15.960
with tools like
Lighthouse and AMP

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.270
and so many more of our
web developer products

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:20.940
that you'll hear
about throughout I/O.

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:23.580
The web platform is
light years ahead

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:25.889
of where it was in
Google's early days,

00:34:25.889 --> 00:34:29.070
and it remains as core
as ever to our mission.

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:31.920
We're excited about the host
of new use cases made possible

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:34.770
by today's modern web,
so be sure to check out

00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:36.840
the web platform state
of the union talk

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:38.820
later today to learn more.

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:40.650
And now, please
join me in welcoming

00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:42.840
Rich to talk about updates
to Material Design.

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:46.207
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:53.120
RICH FULCHER: Thanks, Tal.

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:56.690
I'm going to talk about
Material Design's new approach

00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:59.870
to customizing our apps, and
share some of the new tools

00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:02.180
and resources we've created.

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:05.540
We introduced Material
Design in 2014

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:07.970
as a system for creating
bold, beautiful,

00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:12.060
and consistent digital
products across platforms.

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:14.480
We were responding
to the desire that we

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:17.330
heard from you and
developers around the world

00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:20.090
for clear design
guidance, for advice

00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:23.240
that would make the
experiences you create better

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:24.920
for your users.

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:27.860
Material has become
the design foundation

00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:30.050
for all Google products.

00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:35.210
And you've taken it and launched
it into millions of apps.

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:39.320
But we've heard two
sentiments especially clearly

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:42.260
after hundreds of design
reviews with product teams

00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:43.910
and developers.

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:46.550
First, that you didn't
always see Material

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:49.910
as flexible enough, that
products from different brands

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:52.100
looked too similar.

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:55.910
And second, that our
engineering support for Material

00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:59.630
needed to be stronger so that
you could more easily realize

00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:01.950
your design vision.

00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:07.080
Our goal has always been to
provide more than just a design

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:08.460
blueprint.

00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:12.610
We are committed to
delivering resources, tools,

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:15.690
and engineering components
to make it easier for product

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:17.550
teams to work
together seamlessly

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:21.780
from design to development so
that you can deliver customized

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:25.510
experiences for your users.

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:27.300
That's why we're
proud to announce

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:32.730
Material Theming, a major update
to the Material Design system.

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:36.930
With Material Theming, we're
delivering a truly unified

00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:38.570
and adaptable design system.

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:45.930
It enables you to express
your brand's unique identity

00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:50.400
using color, using type,
and shape consistently

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.260
across your product.

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:55.920
Material Theming retains
the consistent guidance

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:59.260
from Material and expands on it.

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:00.234
Let's take a look.

00:37:00.234 --> 00:37:00.900
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:05.040
- What if it was possible
to design and build better

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:10.800
so your ideas could scale from
a single sheet to a system?

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:14.490
With Material, you can
apply color dynamically

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:20.410
so that every touch enhances
the character of your design.

00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:24.620
Typography is adaptable
so you can express more

00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:28.480
by customizing for
style and legibility.

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:32.500
Craft an experience that's
responsive across device

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:34.970
and platform.

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:40.130
Streamline collaboration with
tools and open source code,

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:44.390
making it easy to express
your brand's unique identity,

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:50.290
balancing form and function
down to every last detail.

00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:54.012
Material Design
isn't a single style.

00:37:54.012 --> 00:37:59.030
It's an adaptable design system
inspired by paper and ink

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:03.250
and engineered so you can build
beautiful, usable products

00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:03.750
faster.

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:10.120
What will you make?

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:13.457
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:38:13.457 --> 00:38:14.040
[END PLAYBACK]

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:17.470
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:23.090
RICH FULCHER: Material
Theming puts you in charge.

00:38:23.090 --> 00:38:26.120
When you make just a few
decisions about aspects

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.790
like color or type,
for example, we'll

00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:31.910
apply those throughout
your design.

00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:34.340
You'll see options
for customization

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:36.950
across our design guidelines.

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:40.940
And we've added hundreds
of new examples.

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:44.270
All still Material, but
reflecting a much wider range

00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:46.820
of products and styles.

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:48.740
When you see something
you like, you

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:51.110
can use our handy
redline viewer to check

00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:55.910
the dimensions, padding, and
even the hex color values.

00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:59.270
Today, we're also
releasing two new tools

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:03.390
to make it faster to go from
design to implementation.

00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:06.350
First, Material Theme Editor.

00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:09.680
This plugin for the
popular application Sketch

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:12.560
helps designers
create and customize

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.780
a unique Material theme.

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:19.410
Change one theme value, and
it cascades across the design.

00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:24.480
Then that work can be shared
easily using Material Gallery.

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:27.660
This is the tool used by
product teams at Google

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:30.990
to review and comment
on design iterations,

00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:33.720
and it's now
available to everyone.

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:37.500
When it's time to build, you
can see automatic redlines.

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:40.770
You can identify exactly
which component is being used

00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:43.580
and how it's been customized.

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:49.420
But we need to make all of
this easier not just to design,

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:51.580
but to realize in code.

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:55.660
So our open source
Material Design components

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:58.960
for Android, iOS, the
web, and Flutter--

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:00.370
all with Material Theming--

00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:01.495
are available today.

00:40:01.495 --> 00:40:04.708
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:09.560
These are the same
components we use

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:11.920
at Google to build our apps.

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:16.360
And just as Google creates a
custom Material theme that best

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:19.600
reflects our brand in products--
starting with the new Gmail

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:21.040
for the web--

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:23.530
you can use these
same components

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:28.150
to create an experience and a
theme that is right for you.

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:31.900
More Material components and
Material Theming customizations

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:34.900
will be coming soon,
so keep an eye out.

00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:36.790
We'll be launching regularly.

00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:38.800
And we'll keep
listening, so please

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.840
keep the feedback coming.

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:43.150
Material Theming--
a new approach

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:46.870
to customizing your apps powered
by open source components,

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:51.370
new tools, and design
guidance-- all available today.

00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:56.740
To make Material yours,
get started at material.io.

00:40:56.740 --> 00:41:00.610
And now, here's Jia to
talk about progress in AI.

00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:03.970
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:10.750
JIA LI: Thanks, Rich.

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:12.610
Hi, everyone.

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:15.700
At Google, we believe
developers are driving

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:18.670
the real-world impact of AI.

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:23.290
Of course, we understand
how complex this can be.

00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:27.760
Machine learning is a
challenge in any environment,

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:32.290
but today's developers often
target multiple platforms

00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:33.950
and devices.

00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:38.120
We also have to juggle
issues like processing power,

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:42.260
bandwidth, latency,
and battery life.

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:45.820
That's why we're committed
to making AI easier

00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:50.440
to use, no matter what
platform you are on.

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:53.560
This begins in the
Cloud, which makes

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:58.480
machine learning accessible to
customers in every industry.

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:01.420
We believe success
in AI should be

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:06.130
determined by your imagination,
not your infrastructure.

00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:10.630
We invest the best technology
to power Google's products,

00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:15.560
and Google Cloud is making these
resources available to you.

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:19.930
For example, our Cloud
TPUs are widely available

00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:23.380
in public beta, making
machine learning more

00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:26.920
affordable than ever before.

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:32.020
Until recently, training
a model to a high accuracy

00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:36.250
on the ImageNet data set
cost thousands of dollars.

00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:39.280
But in a Stanford
benchmark contest,

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:44.790
our TPUs reached the same
level for less than $50.

00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:50.310
Cloud TPUs are now available to
everyone, and getting started

00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:54.760
is as simple as
following this link.

00:42:54.760 --> 00:43:00.730
And this morning, we announced
our new third generation TPU,

00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:06.220
demonstrating our ongoing
commitment to AI hardware.

00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:10.510
The Cloud also lets us
share our best technology

00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:14.320
through a growing range
of machine learning APIs.

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:17.800
Our latest is Cloud
text-to-speech.

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:21.790
Based on DeepMind's
WaveNet, the same technology

00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:26.020
behind the voices in
the Google Assistants,

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:31.120
it generates speech with 32
voices in multiple languages

00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:33.120
and variants.

00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:36.910
In just a few lines of
code, your application

00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:39.730
can realistically
speak to your users

00:43:39.730 --> 00:43:43.950
across many platforms
and devices.

00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:48.160
For more sophisticated
interaction with your users,

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:52.210
text-to-speech can be paired
with Dialogflow Enterprise

00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:53.740
Edition.

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:58.210
Dialogflow makes it easy to
build a conversational agent,

00:43:58.210 --> 00:44:01.450
even with no prior experience.

00:44:01.450 --> 00:44:04.630
It understands the
intent and context

00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:09.140
of what a user says and
generates accurate responses,

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:11.110
whether you are
shopping for clothes

00:44:11.110 --> 00:44:14.440
or scheduling your bike repair.

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:19.090
Finally, Cloud AI is
always exploring new ways

00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:23.140
to put more power in
the hands of developers.

00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:27.400
This effort continues
with Cloud AutoML,

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:31.780
which automates the creation
of machine learning models.

00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:34.990
Our first
widely-available release

00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:37.540
will be AutoML
Vision, which makes

00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:42.160
it possible to recognize
images unique to your vocation

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:44.830
without writing any code.

00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:47.290
You provide the
training examples,

00:44:47.290 --> 00:44:50.530
and AutoML does the rest.

00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:54.010
Our alpha users are
already accomplishing

00:44:54.010 --> 00:44:59.530
a lot with AutoML, from
identifying poisonous spiders

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:03.620
to helping the blind
better understand images.

00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:07.130
But Vision is just
the beginning.

00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:09.520
We're looking forward
to bringing AutoML

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:13.630
to more machine learning
tasks very soon.

00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:17.510
To learn more about
all Cloud AI products,

00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:24.110
including AutoML early
adoption, please visit our site.

00:45:24.110 --> 00:45:27.430
But Cloud AI technology
isn't the only thing

00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:30.550
that we're pushing
in new directions.

00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:33.850
TensorFlow has become
a standard in machine

00:45:33.850 --> 00:45:37.450
learning since we open
sourced it two years ago,

00:45:37.450 --> 00:45:40.930
with 13 million downloads.

00:45:40.930 --> 00:45:45.970
Now we're focusing on
bringing it to new platforms.

00:45:45.970 --> 00:45:49.780
We recently announced
TensorFlow.js,

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:53.440
which brings machine learning
to millions of web developers

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:55.690
through JavaScript.

00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:59.470
New models can be created
right in the browser,

00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:03.130
or on the server
side through Node.js.

00:46:03.130 --> 00:46:07.170
While models trained offline
can be imported, and run

00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:10.720
with WebGL acceleration.

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:15.100
Of course, there is a big
world beyond the browser.

00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:18.430
We also introduced
TensorFlow Lite last year,

00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:21.610
which brings machine
learning to Edge devices,

00:46:21.610 --> 00:46:25.420
including Android
and iOS phones.

00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:29.830
This allows offline
processing with low latency

00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:35.000
and ensures sensitive data
never leaves the device.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:40.180
TensorFlow Lite also supports
hardware like the Raspberry Pi,

00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:45.550
so smart devices like the AIY
Project Vision and Voice Kits

00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:48.520
can leverage it as well.

00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:52.370
As Dave announced
earlier this morning,

00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:56.830
we've released ML Kit
in beta, an SDK that

00:46:56.830 --> 00:46:59.590
brings Google's machine
learning capabilities

00:46:59.590 --> 00:47:03.130
to mobile developers
through Firebase.

00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:05.920
The same technology
that has powered

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:10.030
Google's own experiences,
like text recognition

00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:14.110
in Google Translate and
Smart Reply in Gmail,

00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:18.190
will be available to
power your own apps.

00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:24.130
Our vision for AI at Google is
turning the latest technology

00:47:24.130 --> 00:47:28.840
into products that make
better life for everyone.

00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:34.360
But we cannot do this without
creative developers like you.

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:38.470
Together, we can
bring AI to the world.

00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:43.390
To talk more about how Google is
supporting mobile development,

00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:45.437
let me introduce Francis Ma.

00:47:45.437 --> 00:47:46.391
Thank you.

00:47:46.391 --> 00:47:49.730
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:54.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:56.310
FRANCIS MA: Thank you, Jia.

00:47:56.310 --> 00:48:00.330
Our mission for Firebase is to
help mobile app teams succeed

00:48:00.330 --> 00:48:02.040
by providing a
platform to help you

00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:06.180
solve key problems across
the lifecycle of your app--

00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:09.360
from building your app
to improving app quality

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:11.700
to growing your business.

00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:14.280
We've come a long way
since we expanded Firebase

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:16.740
two years ago from
a real-time database

00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:19.560
to a broad app
development platform.

00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:21.750
And it's so exciting
to see there

00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:25.440
are now over 1.2
million apps actively

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:28.320
using Firebase every
month, including

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:33.480
many of the top Android and iOS
apps like Pandora, Pinterest,

00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:35.560
and Flipkart.

00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:38.810
We appreciate so many of you
are trusting us with your apps,

00:48:38.810 --> 00:48:42.670
whether you're a sole developer
or working in large teams.

00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:45.400
We're committed to helping
developers at companies

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:48.860
of all sizes to succeed.

00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:50.410
Now, one of our key
goals is to help

00:48:50.410 --> 00:48:53.500
you take care of the critical,
but sometimes less glamorous

00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:57.010
parts of app development so you
can focus more on your users

00:48:57.010 --> 00:48:58.780
and build cool stuff.

00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:01.270
As an example, we've
worked hard to ensure

00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:03.070
we're ready to meet
your compliance

00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:06.480
needs with many privacy
and security standards,

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:09.910
as well as with
the upcoming GDPR.

00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:12.880
We are also continuing
to expand the platform

00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:17.620
to further simplify everyday
developer challenges.

00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:20.440
A little over a year
ago, the Fabric team

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:23.530
joined forces with us to bring
the best of our platforms

00:49:23.530 --> 00:49:25.360
together.

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:28.150
And we've made a lot
of progress since then.

00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:29.770
In the last couple
of months, we've

00:49:29.770 --> 00:49:33.550
brought Crashlytics, Fabric's
flagship crash reporter,

00:49:33.550 --> 00:49:35.200
into Firebase.

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:37.000
And we've improved
it by integrating it

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.030
with Google Analytics so
you can see what users

00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:43.270
did in your app that led
up to a crash for much

00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:45.550
easier diagnosis.

00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:48.280
With the combination of
Crashlytics, performance

00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:50.590
monitoring, and
Google Analytics,

00:49:50.590 --> 00:49:53.740
Firebase is not just a platform
to help you build your app's

00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:57.400
infrastructure, but also to
help you better understand

00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:00.210
and improve your app.

00:50:00.210 --> 00:50:01.710
Another major set
of advancements

00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:04.410
we've been making to
Firebase over the last year

00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:08.040
is introducing machine
learning to the platform.

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:10.620
A few months ago, we
took our first step

00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:13.500
with the release of
Firebase Predictions.

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:17.130
Predictions applies ML
to your analytics data

00:50:17.130 --> 00:50:20.020
and predicts the future
behavior of your users

00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:24.390
so you can take proactive
actions to optimize your app.

00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:27.270
For example, you can lower
the difficulty of your game

00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:30.600
for users who are likely
to abandon it, or send

00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:34.050
special offers to users
who are likely to spend.

00:50:34.050 --> 00:50:36.720
And you can also run A/B
tests with different setup

00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:39.320
to see which of
these performed best.

00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:41.820
So Predictions
was the first step

00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:46.140
that we took to bring the power
of Google's ML to work for you.

00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:49.140
And today, we're
taking our second step

00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:53.060
with the release of
ML Kit in public beta.

00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:57.030
ML Kit-- we're bringing
together Google's machine

00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:59.580
learning technologies
from across Google

00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:02.460
and making that available
to every mobile developer

00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:05.790
working on Android and iOS.

00:51:05.790 --> 00:51:08.940
ML Kit provides five
out-of-the-box APIs,

00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:11.640
like image labeling
and text recognition,

00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:15.510
and these APIs can run on-device
for low latency processing

00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:19.350
or in the Cloud for
higher levels of accuracy.

00:51:19.350 --> 00:51:22.320
You can also bring your own
custom TensorFlow Lite model

00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:24.550
if you have more specific needs.

00:51:24.550 --> 00:51:26.190
So let's talk through
an example of how

00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:28.410
ML Kit can be used in an app.

00:51:28.410 --> 00:51:29.540
Now, I'm a dad of two.

00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:31.920
And my young kids are always
so curious about the world

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:32.880
around them.

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:34.590
And I thought it'd be
fun to build an app

00:51:34.590 --> 00:51:37.980
where we can take pictures
and identify objects in them.

00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:41.310
And by using ML Kit's
on-device image labeling API,

00:51:41.310 --> 00:51:45.520
it's easy for me to apply ML
to identify different objects--

00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:48.880
it's a dog, a tree, or a bridge.

00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:51.440
Now, as many of you are aware,
one of the key challenges

00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:55.020
of building for mobile is
having a low latency response

00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:56.790
and assurance that
it can work even

00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:58.870
without a network connection.

00:51:58.870 --> 00:52:01.890
And by using ML
Kit's on-device API,

00:52:01.890 --> 00:52:04.200
I can be assured that
image labeling will work,

00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:09.430
even if I'm out on a remote hike
with no network connectivity.

00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:13.056
So on-device APIs are great
for low latency processing,

00:52:13.056 --> 00:52:14.430
but there are
other times where I

00:52:14.430 --> 00:52:17.730
want to optimize for
highest accuracy possible.

00:52:17.730 --> 00:52:20.260
For example, when
identifying landmarks,

00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:23.340
I want my kids to know this is
the Golden Gate Bridge and not

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:25.110
just any bridge.

00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:28.560
And ML Kit's Cloud-powered
APIs give me that.

00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:30.900
They have a much higher
level of accuracy

00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:35.970
and can be easily integrated
right from my app client code.

00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:39.000
Then there are other situations
where you may have more

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.780
specific needs than what the
out-of-the-box APIs can cover.

00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:45.540
And for those times, you'd
want to bring your own custom

00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:47.130
ML models.

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:49.320
Now, as mobile developers,
we know how important

00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:51.600
it is to keep your
app binary small

00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:54.870
and be able to iterate on
the experience rapidly.

00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:57.930
With ML Kit, you can
upload your TensorFlow Lite

00:52:57.930 --> 00:53:00.150
model and [? surf ?]
that through Google's

00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:02.130
global infrastructure.

00:53:02.130 --> 00:53:04.650
Your app can dynamically
retrieve these models

00:53:04.650 --> 00:53:06.992
and evaluate them on-device.

00:53:06.992 --> 00:53:09.450
This means you don't need to
bundle the model with your app

00:53:09.450 --> 00:53:11.970
binary, and you
can also update it

00:53:11.970 --> 00:53:15.590
without re-publishing
your entire app.

00:53:15.590 --> 00:53:18.720
And since ML Kit is
available through Firebase,

00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:21.210
it's easy for you to take
advantage of the broader

00:53:21.210 --> 00:53:23.010
Firebase platform--

00:53:23.010 --> 00:53:26.550
for example, experimenting
with different ML models

00:53:26.550 --> 00:53:30.660
using A/B testing, or
storing your image labels

00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:34.380
with Cloud Firestore, or
measuring processing latency

00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:37.680
with performance
monitoring, or understanding

00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:41.700
the impact on user engagement
with Google Analytics.

00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:44.130
We are so excited
about the possibilities

00:53:44.130 --> 00:53:46.350
that machine learning
unlocks, whether you

00:53:46.350 --> 00:53:49.470
want to supercharge your
growth or build amazing user

00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:50.550
experiences.

00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:52.470
We want to harness
Google's advances

00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:55.440
to help you build
and grow your app.

00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:58.020
And with that, I'd like to
turn it over to Nathan Martz

00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:00.810
to talk about another area
of exciting advancements

00:54:00.810 --> 00:54:02.280
in mobile computing--

00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:03.670
augmented reality.

00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:04.170
Thank you.

00:54:04.170 --> 00:54:07.656
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:54:07.656 --> 00:54:12.138
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:12.138 --> 00:54:13.940
NATHAN MARTZ: Hey, everybody.

00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:18.760
I got to say, it is incredibly
exciting to be here today.

00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:22.240
At Google, we believe that
augmented reality represents

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:26.050
one of the most exciting
advances in mobile computing

00:54:26.050 --> 00:54:27.700
today.

00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:31.210
By enabling our devices to
see and sense the world much

00:54:31.210 --> 00:54:35.710
like we do, AR allows us to
interact with digital content

00:54:35.710 --> 00:54:38.980
and information in the context
of the real world, which

00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:43.720
is exactly where it's often
the most useful and accessible.

00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:46.740
And as our phones learn to
see the world in new ways,

00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:50.380
they unlock new possibilities
for the kinds of experiences

00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:53.200
that developers can create.

00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:55.090
That's why, just
three months ago, we

00:54:55.090 --> 00:54:59.110
launched ARCore, our platform
for building augmented reality

00:54:59.110 --> 00:55:01.330
experiences, to
allow you to take

00:55:01.330 --> 00:55:04.630
advantage of this
incredible new technology.

00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:07.600
And we've already seen
some amazing apps.

00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:10.630
For example, you can
now create a floor plan

00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:13.000
just by walking
around your home.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.950
You can visualize
the intricacies

00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:18.070
of the human nervous
system at real-world scale.

00:55:18.070 --> 00:55:20.470
Or if you like, transform
your dining room table

00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:23.470
into the home of your
next virtual pet.

00:55:23.470 --> 00:55:25.840
And as you've been
building, we've

00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:29.380
been learning and
listening to your feedback.

00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:31.660
Today, we're rolling
out a major update

00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:35.680
to ARCore to help you create
even richer, more immersive

00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:38.770
and interactive experiences.

00:55:38.770 --> 00:55:41.890
First, we know that
creating a 3D app

00:55:41.890 --> 00:55:43.930
can be challenging,
especially when you

00:55:43.930 --> 00:55:48.430
have to write directly to
lower-level APIs like OpenGL.

00:55:48.430 --> 00:55:52.000
That's why we've created
Sceneform, a brand new 3D

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.940
framework that makes it
easy for Java developers

00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:58.240
to create ARCore applications.

00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:00.040
And the thing is,
Sceneform is not just

00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:02.590
for people creating
apps from scratch.

00:56:02.590 --> 00:56:05.170
Its design actually
makes it really easy

00:56:05.170 --> 00:56:08.050
to quickly add ARCore
features to apps

00:56:08.050 --> 00:56:10.810
that you've already released.

00:56:10.810 --> 00:56:13.300
Under the hood,
the Sceneform SDK

00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:17.410
includes an expressive API,
a powerful, physically-based

00:56:17.410 --> 00:56:21.100
renderer, and seamless
support for 3D assets

00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:23.680
inside of Android Studio.

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:26.920
Best of all, Sceneform
is optimized for mobile,

00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:31.150
architected from the ground-up
with performance, memory,

00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:34.010
and binary size in mind.

00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:37.200
So we also know that
sometimes as a developer,

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:39.350
you want to build
an AR app that can

00:56:39.350 --> 00:56:43.700
react to the specific physical
objects in the real world.

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:46.880
That's why today we're
introducing Augmented Images,

00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:50.630
a new capability in ARCore that
makes it possible to attach

00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:54.530
AR content and experiences
to the physical images

00:56:54.530 --> 00:56:56.360
in the real world.

00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:57.860
And Augmented
Images doesn't just

00:56:57.860 --> 00:57:00.140
detect the presence
of a picture.

00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:03.380
It can actually compute
the precise 3D orientation

00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:05.910
of that image in real time.

00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:07.910
So now you can use Augmented
Images to do things

00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:12.260
like bring a textbook to life,
create new forms of artwork.

00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:15.260
You can even see what's inside
the toy box before you open it.

00:57:17.970 --> 00:57:20.790
Finally, though, we
know that if we truly

00:57:20.790 --> 00:57:24.450
want our computers to
work more like we do,

00:57:24.450 --> 00:57:28.080
they need to involve not
just the things in our world,

00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:31.350
but the people in our lives.

00:57:31.350 --> 00:57:34.440
Fundamentally, our time
here is spent with family

00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:35.940
and friends and colleagues.

00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:41.800
We collaborate, we create, we
share experiences together.

00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:44.550
That's why we believe that
every incredible thing that you

00:57:44.550 --> 00:57:47.310
can do by yourself
in AR today, you

00:57:47.310 --> 00:57:51.440
should be able to do
together with someone else.

00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:55.750
It makes me very proud to
announce the next major step

00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:57.920
in how our phones
see and understand

00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:00.740
the world, a new
capability in ARCore

00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:04.280
that we call Cloud Anchors.

00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:07.580
With Cloud Anchors, we
actually allow multiple devices

00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:08.810
to generate--

00:58:08.810 --> 00:58:12.380
thank you-- a shared,
synchronized understanding

00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:16.460
of the world so that multiple
phones can see and interact

00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:20.180
with the exact same digital
content in the same place

00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:22.190
at the same time.

00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:23.690
And this allows
you, as a developer,

00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:27.620
to create applications that
are collaborative and creative,

00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:31.097
multi-user and multiplayer.

00:58:31.097 --> 00:58:32.930
To show you exactly
what I mean, we actually

00:58:32.930 --> 00:58:35.060
integrated Cloud
Anchor support into

00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:39.690
our experimental, open source,
AR drawing app "Just a Line."

00:58:39.690 --> 00:58:40.440
Let's take a look.

00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:41.106
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:58:41.106 --> 00:58:44.376
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:59:10.625 --> 00:59:12.255
So yeah.

00:59:12.255 --> 00:59:15.720
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:17.160
Thank you.

00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:21.060
We know that Cloud Anchors will
enable many new kinds of AR

00:59:21.060 --> 00:59:21.790
experiences.

00:59:21.790 --> 00:59:24.510
AR experiences that
combine the power

00:59:24.510 --> 00:59:28.990
of your device, your creativity,
and the people around you.

00:59:28.990 --> 00:59:32.490
But because these
experiences are so powerful,

00:59:32.490 --> 00:59:35.100
we believe that they
should work regardless

00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:37.590
of the kind of phone you own.

00:59:37.590 --> 00:59:39.510
That's why I'm
very excited to say

00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:41.820
that we're making
ARCore's Cloud Anchors

00:59:41.820 --> 00:59:45.780
available on both
Android and iOS devices.

00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:49.161
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:50.610 --> 00:59:52.181
It's pretty awesome.

00:59:52.181 --> 00:59:54.180
So everything that I've
just talked about today,

00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:56.730
from Sceneform to
Augmented Images to Cloud

00:59:56.730 --> 01:00:01.860
Anchors and more, is available
for you to use right now.

01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:04.380
You can learn more about that
and start creating your own

01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:10.499
ARCore-powered app by going
to developers.google.com/ar.

01:00:10.499 --> 01:00:12.540
And with that, I'm going
to hand it back to Jason

01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:13.517
to wrap things up.

01:00:13.517 --> 01:00:15.100
Thank you all very
much for your time.

01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:18.530
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:24.631
JASON TITUS: Thanks, Nathan.

01:00:24.631 --> 01:00:26.130
Hopefully you can
see from our talks

01:00:26.130 --> 01:00:28.620
today that we're
committed to meet you

01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:31.770
where you are, no matter what
platform you're building on,

01:00:31.770 --> 01:00:34.230
and help you take advantage
of the latest innovations,

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:38.280
from machine learning
to augmented reality.

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:40.050
And much of what
you heard of today

01:00:40.050 --> 01:00:43.060
is built on top of
our Cloud technology.

01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:46.260
This includes powerful APIs
around machine learning,

01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:48.690
smarter data analytics
with BigQuery,

01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:53.220
and a focus on low latency
and high reliability.

01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:55.830
And whenever possible,
we try and take things

01:00:55.830 --> 01:00:59.790
out as open source, like
Kubernetes and TensorFlow,

01:00:59.790 --> 01:01:02.670
so they can be broadly
adopted and openly evolved

01:01:02.670 --> 01:01:05.280
across the industry.

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:07.530
With our Cloud technology,
we're taking the lessons

01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:09.621
we've learned building
large-scale software

01:01:09.621 --> 01:01:10.662
and bringing them to you.

01:01:14.110 --> 01:01:16.790
So I/O, this year,
is bigger than ever.

01:01:16.790 --> 01:01:19.870
We've got some great content
lined up for the next few days.

01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:22.210
And you'll see we're doing
something new this year--

01:01:22.210 --> 01:01:24.040
inspiration talks.

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:27.070
They take a broader look at how
the technology that you build

01:01:27.070 --> 01:01:29.570
affects the world around us.

01:01:29.570 --> 01:01:34.060
So we cover topics like building
for a better tech-life balance,

01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:36.610
the future of
computing, and using

01:01:36.610 --> 01:01:39.520
AI to transform health care.

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:42.670
We all have a responsibility
for what we build

01:01:42.670 --> 01:01:45.280
as well as the people
that we build for,

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:48.670
so I hope you have a
chance to check these out.

01:01:48.670 --> 01:01:50.740
And one of my favorite
parts about having

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:53.200
I/O so close to
campus is that we're

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:55.720
able to bring in more
than 2,000 Googlers who

01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:57.370
built these products.

01:01:57.370 --> 01:02:00.130
They're here not
only to help you,

01:02:00.130 --> 01:02:02.710
but more importantly,
to get your feedback

01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:06.180
on what we can do better.

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:09.090
My hope for this conference
is that each of you

01:02:09.090 --> 01:02:11.130
walks away feeling that
you can do something

01:02:11.130 --> 01:02:13.250
that you couldn't do
before, and that you're

01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:17.490
able to use that knowledge
to build things that matter.

01:02:17.490 --> 01:02:19.765
Thank you very much, and
have a great Google I/O.

01:02:19.765 --> 01:02:21.190
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:25.765
