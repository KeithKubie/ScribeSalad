and for years and when the scholars that

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070
and for years and when the scholars that
 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.460
and for years and when the scholars that
they follow are now telling them if you

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470
they follow are now telling them if you
 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:32.930

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.159
become a suicide bomber you're going to
go to hell that's certainly being

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169
go to hell that's certainly being
 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:35.690

listened to and causing a lot of doubts

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700
listened to and causing a lot of doubts
 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.580

and I think in the years to come is

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590
and I think in the years to come is
 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.380
and I think in the years to come is
probably going to turn off the tap of

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.390
probably going to turn off the tap of
 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.900
probably going to turn off the tap of
recruits to al-qaeda so we might be at

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910
recruits to al-qaeda so we might be at
 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.110
recruits to al-qaeda so we might be at
the peak of the problem right now
