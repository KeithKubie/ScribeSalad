ANDREW BROGOON: Hey, everybody.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.470
I'm Andrew Brogoon, and welcome
back to the Mobile Ads Garage.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.950
Today, with the help of my
partner, Gary the Graphics Guy,

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.590
we're going to talk about test
ads, why they're important,

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.640
and a couple of
ways to enable them.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.760
All right, let's
start with the why.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.460
Test ads are kind of like the
seat belts in a drag racer.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.080
Not the sexiest
part of the machine,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.720
but they will save you
from a ton of trouble.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.150
When you use test ads properly,
you help insure three things.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.630
Number 1, advertisers
are charged correctly.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.020
Number 2, everybody's stats and
reporting can log correctly,

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.220
including yours.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.860
And 3, you avoid one of
the most common causes

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.390
of account suspensions.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.220
Let's take a look
at these real quick.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.660
Number 1 is pretty easy.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.550
If you test with
live ads, the server

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.720
thinks your impressions and
click throughs are real,

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.720
which means they get
logged and somebody ends up

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.890
paying for them.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.650
That may not sound like much,
but when tens of thousands

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.840
of developers do it at
once, all over the world,

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.400
that's a lot of
imaginary traffic

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.170
to ask somebody to pay for.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.884
Number 2, accurate
stats and reporting.

00:01:03.884 --> 00:01:06.550
If you're testing with live ads,
all those impressions and click

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:07.950
throughs record
it as real, which

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.680
means your reporting is off,
as are the numbers for the ads

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.600
and advertisers themselves.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.390
Last and probably highest
on the list of your concerns

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.480
is that test ads help you
avoid account suspensions.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.030
If you're working on your app,
loading and clicking live ads,

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.700
the server is going to say,
hey, this person just clicked

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.170
on like, 10 ads in a row.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.010
That looks like click fraud, and
then down comes the ban hammer.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.930
All right, so that's the why.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.762
Now, let's talk how.

00:01:32.762 --> 00:01:34.470
The good news about
implementing test ads

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.540
is that there's two
fairly simple ways to do

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.100
it, one of which is dead easy.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.910
Fair enough.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.040
The quickest way to make
sure you get test ads

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.500
is just to use one of our
predefined test ads units

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.970
when loading ads.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.850
We have a list of them at our
Android and iOS testing guides.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.470
Each format is
covered, and you can

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.130
take the ad units
right out of there

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.800
and pop them into your apps.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.440
Plus, this video that
you're watching right now

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.424
is embedded in the
test ads guide.

00:01:59.424 --> 00:02:01.340
So if you're watching
me in an embedded player

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.260
right now instead
of on YouTube.com,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.390
chances are you're on
the right page already.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.900
Just pause me and scroll down.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.820
If you use those
test ad unit IDs,

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.630
you'll see a creative like this.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.690
It'll probably declare
itself as a test ad

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.570
so you'll know right away
that you're doing it right.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.690
All right, so that's the first
way of implementing test ads.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.540
The other is to use test
devices when making your request

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.560
object.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.680
These APIs for
Android, IOS, and Unity

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.660
allow you to register
a particular device

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.320
to receive test ads, even
when using your own ad units.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.080
You pass them a hash
device ID and the SDK

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.180
will make sure that when
that device runs the code

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.760
and makes a request, it
always gets a test ad.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.640
That's a good question.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.130
They're shown in the
Android or iOS device logs

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.780
when an ad is requested.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.120
Just look for a line that
references test devices,

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.980
copy the ID, and
you're good to go.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.640
Another good question.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.430
You can use one of the tested
unit IDs I mentioned above,

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.650
or just download and
run one of our samples.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.470
You'll see the device
hash in a log either way.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.380
One of the advantages of using
test devices with your own ad

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.870
units is that you're not
stuck with the default test

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:12.890
creatives.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.530
Instead, you get dummy
versions of production ads

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.840
that are clearly
tagged as test ads.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.790
So you get to see a wide
variety of creatives

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.860
while still using test ads.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.050
Plus, when you use
your own ad units,

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.760
your mediation
configurations are still

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.630
in play, which means you'll
sometimes see the AdMob test

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.490
ad, but you'll also
get mediated ads.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.440
That can help you test
mediated ad units.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.880
But be careful.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.430
You can see, there's
no test ad label here.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.980
Not every network is capable
of deciding at runtime

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.330
to show a test ad
instead of a real one.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.900
Some have server side flags,
their own way of registering

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.070
test devices, things like that.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.280
So make sure you check
the documentation provided

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.830
by the networks you're mediating
and configure them accordingly.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.100
All right, that's about
it for this episode.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.600
But I do have some
resources for you

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.770
down in the description
for this video.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.590
First up, our links
to our testing guides

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.930
for Android, iOS, and Unity.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.710
You'll find those test
units I mentioned,

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.530
along with some other good tips.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.630
There's also a link to
our SDK support forum,

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.213
where you can post
technical questions

00:04:10.213 --> 00:04:11.979
and get answers from
our support team.

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:13.520
And of course, if
you have a question

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.829
about this video or an idea for
a topic you'd like us to cover,

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.840
leave a comment below, and Gary
and I will see you next time.
