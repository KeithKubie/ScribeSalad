down with art directors usually and we

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500
down with art directors usually and we
 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.470
down with art directors usually and we
would think about different ways to

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480
would think about different ways to
 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.720
would think about different ways to
solve a problem advertising his problem

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730
solve a problem advertising his problem
 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.480
solve a problem advertising his problem
solving a creative way and we would

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490
solving a creative way and we would
 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.920
solving a creative way and we would
throw everything out I mean we were

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930
throw everything out I mean we were
 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.109
throw everything out I mean we were
never embarrassed to throw it an idea it

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119
never embarrassed to throw it an idea it
 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.670
never embarrassed to throw it an idea it
could come from anywhere I mean it could

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680
could come from anywhere I mean it could
 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.060
could come from anywhere I mean it could
come from another you know I never stole

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070
come from another you know I never stole
 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.650

from advertising but you'd look at art

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660
from advertising but you'd look at art
 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.680
from advertising but you'd look at art
you'd walk around and sometimes their

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690
you'd walk around and sometimes their
 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.119
you'd walk around and sometimes their
relationships between things if you're

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129
relationships between things if you're
 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.100
relationships between things if you're
doing something for example for for a

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110
doing something for example for for a
 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.260
doing something for example for for a
car you kind of think visually about

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270
car you kind of think visually about
 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.729
car you kind of think visually about
that and then you try to completely do

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739
that and then you try to completely do
 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.319
that and then you try to completely do
the opposite so how do you do something

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329
the opposite so how do you do something
 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.150
the opposite so how do you do something
you don't shoot on the road how do you

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160
you don't shoot on the road how do you
 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.410
you don't shoot on the road how do you
do solve this problem without show your

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420
do solve this problem without show your
 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.600
do solve this problem without show your
car my process is usually how to do

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610
car my process is usually how to do
 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.610
car my process is usually how to do
something really new but to solve the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620
something really new but to solve the
 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.130
something really new but to solve the
problem and communicate it and I think

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140
problem and communicate it and I think
 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.450
problem and communicate it and I think
that's like is going in different

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460
that's like is going in different
 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.069
that's like is going in different
directions starting with sometimes

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079
directions starting with sometimes
 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.979
directions starting with sometimes
something completely obscured say in the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989
something completely obscured say in the
 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.619
something completely obscured say in the
office wow there's a straw what can we

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629
office wow there's a straw what can we
 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.630
office wow there's a straw what can we
do with the straw and solve this problem

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640
do with the straw and solve this problem
 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.880
do with the straw and solve this problem
that the car gets better gas mileage and

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890
that the car gets better gas mileage and
 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.160
that the car gets better gas mileage and
it starts that way and then someone will

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170
it starts that way and then someone will
 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.539
it starts that way and then someone will
say something else and someone will say

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549
say something else and someone will say
 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:12.679
say something else and someone will say
something else and then you'll come up

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689
something else and then you'll come up
 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.690
something else and then you'll come up
with a visual idea that may say that

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700
with a visual idea that may say that
 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.800
with a visual idea that may say that
would be really interesting I've never

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810
would be really interesting I've never
 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.330
would be really interesting I've never
seen that a car commercial how can we

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340
seen that a car commercial how can we
 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.740
seen that a car commercial how can we
make that relate to this problem we're

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750
make that relate to this problem we're
 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.530
make that relate to this problem we're
trying to solve so a lot of it comes

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540
trying to solve so a lot of it comes
 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.350
trying to solve so a lot of it comes
from from that and connects back to

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360
from from that and connects back to
 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.230
from from that and connects back to
things we do but I don't know where it

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240
things we do but I don't know where it
 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.450
things we do but I don't know where it
comes from but the smartest people most

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460
comes from but the smartest people most
 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.609
comes from but the smartest people most
creative people I know you know they

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619
creative people I know you know they
 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.130
creative people I know you know they
haven't built in they just their nature

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140
haven't built in they just their nature
 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.380
haven't built in they just their nature
is to come up with things and it's their

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390
is to come up with things and it's their
 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.630
is to come up with things and it's their
other brains work that way and I think

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640
other brains work that way and I think
 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.940
other brains work that way and I think
that mine works that way comes at things

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950
that mine works that way comes at things
 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.859
that mine works that way comes at things
from different angles all the time I

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869
from different angles all the time I
 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.050
from different angles all the time I
don't know why it does but it comes very

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060
don't know why it does but it comes very
 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.240
don't know why it does but it comes very
naturally to me to do these things on it

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250
naturally to me to do these things on it
 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.679
naturally to me to do these things on it
doesn't come naturally for me to do a

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689
doesn't come naturally for me to do a
 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.450
doesn't come naturally for me to do a
lot of obvious things that most people

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460
lot of obvious things that most people
 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.460
lot of obvious things that most people
can do naturally but one thing that is

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470
can do naturally but one thing that is
 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.990
can do naturally but one thing that is
natural for me is to kind of creatively

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000
natural for me is to kind of creatively
 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.070
natural for me is to kind of creatively
