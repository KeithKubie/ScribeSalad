so last year we announced Cullen as a

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209
so last year we announced Cullen as a
 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.059
so last year we announced Cullen as a
first-class language on the platform and

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069
first-class language on the platform and
 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.459
first-class language on the platform and
inside of Android studio since that

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:19.469
inside of Android studio since that
 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:21.229
inside of Android studio since that
point we've been continuing to invest in

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239
point we've been continuing to invest in
 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.420

the Kotlin so inside of Android studio

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430
the Kotlin so inside of Android studio
 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.780
the Kotlin so inside of Android studio
3.1 you can not only do Kotlin checks in

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790
3.1 you can not only do Kotlin checks in
 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.569
3.1 you can not only do Kotlin checks in
the ID but also on the command line so

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579
the ID but also on the command line so
 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:30.949
the ID but also on the command line so
if you do a lot of automation test with

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959
if you do a lot of automation test with
 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.809
if you do a lot of automation test with
Kotlin now you have that support built

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819
Kotlin now you have that support built
 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.160
Kotlin now you have that support built
in inside of Android studio now for

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170
in inside of Android studio now for
 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.990
in inside of Android studio now for
those of you who have C or C++ code

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000
those of you who have C or C++ code
 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.399

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.050
allowed you to drill into your C++ code
and understand the performance impact of

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060
and understand the performance impact of
 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.909
and understand the performance impact of
your C++ code and of course that's on

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:49.919
your C++ code and of course that's on
 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:52.009
your C++ code and of course that's on
the unified timeline inside our

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019
the unified timeline inside our
 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.129
the unified timeline inside our
performance profilers and speaking of

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139
performance profilers and speaking of
 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:56.929
performance profilers and speaking of
performance profilers we also updated

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:56.939
performance profilers we also updated
 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:58.699
performance profilers we also updated
the network profiler so you know that

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709
the network profiler so you know that
 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.830
the network profiler so you know that
many of you have multi-threaded network

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840
many of you have multi-threaded network
 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.990
many of you have multi-threaded network
threads in your app so now you can look

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000
threads in your app so now you can look
 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.059
threads in your app so now you can look
at each individual thread and see the

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069
at each individual thread and see the
 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.069
at each individual thread and see the
performance of that aspect and of course

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079
performance of that aspect and of course

bundle support so let's get right into
 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:51.540
bundle support so let's get right into
that so the key takeaway about app

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550
that so the key takeaway about app
 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.189
that so the key takeaway about app
bundles is that it lets you package and

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199
bundles is that it lets you package and
 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:55.200
bundles is that it lets you package and
upload your app in such a way that the

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210
upload your app in such a way that the

Play Store can create many different

00:05:56.459 --> 00:05:56.469
Play Store can create many different
 

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:58.050
Play Store can create many different
versions of your app one for each

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060
versions of your app one for each
 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.879
versions of your app one for each
combination of chip architecture screen

00:05:59.879 --> 00:05:59.889
combination of chip architecture screen
 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:03.029
combination of chip architecture screen
size and even locale and that makes the

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039
size and even locale and that makes the
 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:06.899
size and even locale and that makes the
download smaller right so in studio all

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:06.909
download smaller right so in studio all
 

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:09.180
download smaller right so in studio all
you have to do is rebuild your app so if

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190
you have to do is rebuild your app so if
 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.779
you have to do is rebuild your app so if
I go to our generate sign APK wizard you

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:12.789
I go to our generate sign APK wizard you
 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:14.399
I go to our generate sign APK wizard you
can see there's a new option if now for

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:14.409
can see there's a new option if now for
 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:19.740
can see there's a new option if now for
generating a app bundle and here I can

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750
generating a app bundle and here I can
 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.089
generating a app bundle and here I can
sign it and it's really important to

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:21.099
sign it and it's really important to
 

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:22.800
sign it and it's really important to
understand that for Google Play to do

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.810
understand that for Google Play to do
 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.379
understand that for Google Play to do
this it has to sign your app so you have

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:25.389
this it has to sign your app so you have
 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:27.120
this it has to sign your app so you have
to give it your encryption key to do

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.130
to give it your encryption key to do
 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.879
to give it your encryption key to do
that so I'm gonna choose to export the

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:29.889
that so I'm gonna choose to export the
 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:33.450
that so I'm gonna choose to export the
encryption key and note also that it's

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.460
encryption key and note also that it's
 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.420
encryption key and note also that it's
not X

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430
not X
 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.910
not X
sporting it into the bundle okay so if

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:36.920
sporting it into the bundle okay so if
 

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.230
sporting it into the bundle okay so if
we look at the little notification here

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240
we look at the little notification here
 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.210
we look at the little notification here
from the bottom right there's a little

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:40.220
from the bottom right there's a little
 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.010
from the bottom right there's a little
link that we added so you can see where

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.020
link that we added so you can see where
 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.080
link that we added so you can see where
we stored that key so you can upload it

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.090
we stored that key so you can upload it
 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:45.970
we stored that key so you can upload it
the UI needs a little work

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:45.980
the UI needs a little work
 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.850
the UI needs a little work
so we'll tweet that so now that we've

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:48.860
so we'll tweet that so now that we've
 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.650
so we'll tweet that so now that we've
created this bundle file we can take a

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:50.660
created this bundle file we can take a
 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:51.250
created this bundle file we can take a
look at it

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:51.260
look at it
 

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.040
look at it
so the apk analyzer also works on bundle

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.050
so the apk analyzer also works on bundle
 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:57.430
so the apk analyzer also works on bundle
files naturally if you look at this it

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:57.440
files naturally if you look at this it
 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.650
files naturally if you look at this it
should looks pretty look pretty familiar

00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:58.660
should looks pretty look pretty familiar
 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.350
should looks pretty look pretty familiar
so dynamic delivery is really really

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360
so dynamic delivery is really really
 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.480
so dynamic delivery is really really
easy for you to do it's basically you

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:04.490
easy for you to do it's basically you
 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.270
easy for you to do it's basically you
know upload your key and rebuild and

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.280
know upload your key and rebuild and
 

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.030
know upload your key and rebuild and
that's in production today we also are

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:10.040
that's in production today we also are
 

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.250
that's in production today we also are
previewing dynamic feature modules and

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:12.260
previewing dynamic feature modules and
 

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.110
previewing dynamic feature modules and
so if you look carefully at my bundle

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:14.120
so if you look carefully at my bundle
 

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.000
so if you look carefully at my bundle
file there's actually this other thing

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:16.010
file there's actually this other thing
 

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.340
file there's actually this other thing
called article composer that just

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:18.350
called article composer that just
 

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.140
called article composer that just
happens to be a name I chose for a

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:20.150
happens to be a name I chose for a
 

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.570
happens to be a name I chose for a
dynamic feature in this app that can

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:22.580
dynamic feature in this app that can
 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.030
dynamic feature in this app that can
compose articles right so how did I do

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:25.040
compose articles right so how did I do
 

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.260
compose articles right so how did I do
that I went to the new module menu we

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:29.270
that I went to the new module menu we
 

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.390
that I went to the new module menu we
have a dynamic feature module module

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:31.400
have a dynamic feature module module
 

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:37.870
have a dynamic feature module module
type and here it doesn't want to go it's

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:37.880
type and here it doesn't want to go it's
 

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:42.280
type and here it doesn't want to go it's
like oh okay here I basically get to

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:42.290
like oh okay here I basically get to
 

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:45.870
like oh okay here I basically get to
choose the name of the feature and also

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:45.880
choose the name of the feature and also
 

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.950
choose the name of the feature and also
enter target I see that's the phone I

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:47.960
enter target I see that's the phone I
 

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.550
enter target I see that's the phone I
have network issues I've already created

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:51.560
have network issues I've already created
 

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.050
have network issues I've already created
this module obviously since you see it

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:53.060
this module obviously since you see it
 

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.310
this module obviously since you see it
my bundle file so let me just show you

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:54.320
my bundle file so let me just show you
 

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.790
my bundle file so let me just show you
how it's all wired together so first I

00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:57.800
how it's all wired together so first I
 

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.140
how it's all wired together so first I
have a new module where we apply this

00:07:59.140 --> 00:07:59.150
have a new module where we apply this
 

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:03.310
have a new module where we apply this
new special Gradle plugin for dynamic

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:03.320
new special Gradle plugin for dynamic
 

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.040
new special Gradle plugin for dynamic
features we have a manifest in that

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:06.050
features we have a manifest in that
 

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:08.260
features we have a manifest in that
module where I can basically say that I

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:08.270
module where I can basically say that I
 

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:10.030
module where I can basically say that I
want this to be on demand and we want

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:10.040
want this to be on demand and we want
 

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.680
want this to be on demand and we want
the place to refuse it so that it can

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:11.690
the place to refuse it so that it can
 

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:13.960
the place to refuse it so that it can
build ap case for older devices that

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:13.970
build ap case for older devices that
 

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:16.330
build ap case for older devices that
don't support this and in our main app

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:16.340
don't support this and in our main app
 

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:19.650
don't support this and in our main app
module we link to these dynamic features

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:19.660
module we link to these dynamic features
 

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:23.230
module we link to these dynamic features
so creating a dynamic feature module is

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:23.240
so creating a dynamic feature module is
 

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.120
so creating a dynamic feature module is
a lot more work for you you're gonna

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:25.130
a lot more work for you you're gonna
 

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.130
a lot more work for you you're gonna
have to use the play core library to

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:27.140
have to use the play core library to
 

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:29.380
have to use the play core library to
react to download installation events

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:29.390
react to download installation events
 

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:31.750
react to download installation events
but it's really useful if you have some

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:31.760
but it's really useful if you have some
 

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.150
but it's really useful if you have some
large functionality in your app that not

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:34.160
large functionality in your app that not
 

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.500
large functionality in your app that not
every user is going to want so you can

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:35.510
every user is going to want so you can
 

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:38.470
every user is going to want so you can
have your base app be small and then do

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:38.480
have your base app be small and then do
 

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.940
have your base app be small and then do
the on-demand installation of these

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:39.950
the on-demand installation of these
 

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.670
the on-demand installation of these
other features one other thing we've

00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:42.680
other features one other thing we've
 

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.030
other features one other thing we've
added to the run config dialog

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:45.040
added to the run config dialog
 

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.360
added to the run config dialog
is the ability for you to choose which

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:48.370
is the ability for you to choose which
 

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:50.910
is the ability for you to choose which
features are included when you are

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:50.920
features are included when you are
 

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.610
features are included when you are
testing locally now to testing download

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:53.620
testing locally now to testing download
 

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:54.900
testing locally now to testing download
installation stuff you'll need to use

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:54.910
installation stuff you'll need to use
 

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:58.710
installation stuff you'll need to use
the Play console testing track all right

00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:58.720
the Play console testing track all right
 

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.509
the Play console testing track all right
so that's dynamic apps let's take a look

00:09:00.509 --> 00:09:00.519
so that's dynamic apps let's take a look
 

00:09:00.519 --> 00:09:04.559
so that's dynamic apps let's take a look
at the profiler so we have several new

00:09:04.559 --> 00:09:04.569
at the profiler so we have several new
 

00:09:04.569 --> 00:09:06.930
at the profiler so we have several new
features in the profiler I'm gonna open

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:06.940
features in the profiler I'm gonna open
 

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:10.680
features in the profiler I'm gonna open
it up and I have an app running this is

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:10.690
it up and I have an app running this is
 

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:12.960
it up and I have an app running this is
the plaid app so the first thing you'll

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:12.970
the plaid app so the first thing you'll
 

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:14.370
the plaid app so the first thing you'll
notice in the bottom left here is we

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:14.380
notice in the bottom left here is we
 

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.980
notice in the bottom left here is we
have a sessions view so you can record

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:16.990
have a sessions view so you can record
 

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:19.829
have a sessions view so you can record
multiple profiling sessions and then you

00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:19.839
multiple profiling sessions and then you
 

00:09:19.839 --> 00:09:22.519
multiple profiling sessions and then you
can go in and sort of compare results

00:09:22.519 --> 00:09:22.529
can go in and sort of compare results
 

00:09:22.529 --> 00:09:25.650
can go in and sort of compare results
one thing I've already recorded earlier

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:25.660
one thing I've already recorded earlier
 

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:27.900
one thing I've already recorded earlier
is a new feature we've added which is

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:27.910
is a new feature we've added which is
 

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:31.559
is a new feature we've added which is
systrace so systrace is this really

00:09:31.559 --> 00:09:31.569
systrace so systrace is this really
 

00:09:31.569 --> 00:09:34.230
systrace so systrace is this really
powerful profiler it looks at data from

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:34.240
powerful profiler it looks at data from
 

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.059
powerful profiler it looks at data from
the kernel so I can see what's going on

00:09:36.059 --> 00:09:36.069
the kernel so I can see what's going on
 

00:09:36.069 --> 00:09:38.939
the kernel so I can see what's going on
on different CPUs there's thousands of

00:09:38.939 --> 00:09:38.949
on different CPUs there's thousands of
 

00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:40.139
on different CPUs there's thousands of
tracing events from the kernel that's

00:09:40.139 --> 00:09:40.149
tracing events from the kernel that's
 

00:09:40.149 --> 00:09:42.150
tracing events from the kernel that's
being recorded it's probably hard to see

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.160
being recorded it's probably hard to see
 

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.879
being recorded it's probably hard to see
on the screen there's some fade

00:09:43.879 --> 00:09:43.889
on the screen there's some fade
 

00:09:43.889 --> 00:09:46.170
on the screen there's some fade
graduation of colors here to show you

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:46.180
graduation of colors here to show you
 

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.019
graduation of colors here to show you
all these events so that's the CPU

00:09:49.019 --> 00:09:49.029
all these events so that's the CPU
 

00:09:49.029 --> 00:09:52.800
all these events so that's the CPU
tracer I'm sorry that's systrace let's

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:52.810
tracer I'm sorry that's systrace let's
 

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:56.370
tracer I'm sorry that's systrace let's
go back into our CPU view now let's

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:56.380
go back into our CPU view now let's
 

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.470
go back into our CPU view now let's
assume actually let me start these were

00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:58.480
assume actually let me start these were
 

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.269
assume actually let me start these were
all pre-recorded sessions let me now

00:10:00.269 --> 00:10:00.279
all pre-recorded sessions let me now
 

00:10:00.279 --> 00:10:02.400
all pre-recorded sessions let me now
attach to the current running session so

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:02.410
attach to the current running session so
 

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:04.410
attach to the current running session so
here's our telemetry view so now I'm

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:04.420
here's our telemetry view so now I'm
 

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:07.319
here's our telemetry view so now I'm
gonna go into the CPU profiler and let's

00:10:07.319 --> 00:10:07.329
gonna go into the CPU profiler and let's
 

00:10:07.329 --> 00:10:09.809
gonna go into the CPU profiler and let's
say I'm interested in recording why my

00:10:09.809 --> 00:10:09.819
say I'm interested in recording why my
 

00:10:09.819 --> 00:10:12.090
say I'm interested in recording why my
UI is so slow when I click on this

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:12.100
UI is so slow when I click on this
 

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:15.600
UI is so slow when I click on this
thumbnail on the right until now what I

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:15.610
thumbnail on the right until now what I
 

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:17.639
thumbnail on the right until now what I
would do is click on this record method

00:10:17.639 --> 00:10:17.649
would do is click on this record method
 

00:10:17.649 --> 00:10:20.970
would do is click on this record method
trace button on the left and I would try

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:20.980
trace button on the left and I would try
 

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.530
trace button on the left and I would try
to quickly press it after doing the

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:22.540
to quickly press it after doing the
 

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.930
to quickly press it after doing the
action but what I can do now is actually

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:24.940
action but what I can do now is actually
 

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:30.840
action but what I can do now is actually
trigger it from code so in 3 2 we have

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:30.850
trigger it from code so in 3 2 we have
 

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:33.120
trigger it from code so in 3 2 we have
this ability for you to call the debug

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:33.130
this ability for you to call the debug
 

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:35.040
this ability for you to call the debug
method this is a standard STK method

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:35.050
method this is a standard STK method
 

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:37.769
method this is a standard STK method
andrew SD bug so I'm telling it I want

00:10:37.769 --> 00:10:37.779
andrew SD bug so I'm telling it I want
 

00:10:37.779 --> 00:10:39.210
andrew SD bug so I'm telling it I want
to start method tracing here at the

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:39.220
to start method tracing here at the
 

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:41.579
to start method tracing here at the
beginning of all and create at the end

00:10:41.579 --> 00:10:41.589
beginning of all and create at the end
 

00:10:41.589 --> 00:10:44.340
beginning of all and create at the end
I'm gonna say stop at the tracing right

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:44.350
I'm gonna say stop at the tracing right
 

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:46.499
I'm gonna say stop at the tracing right
so now then I'm gonna click on the UI

00:10:46.499 --> 00:10:46.509
so now then I'm gonna click on the UI
 

00:10:46.509 --> 00:10:49.860
so now then I'm gonna click on the UI
take a look at what happens in the CPU

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:49.870
take a look at what happens in the CPU
 

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:53.610
take a look at what happens in the CPU
view so you can see it captured exactly

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:53.620
view so you can see it captured exactly
 

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.889
view so you can see it captured exactly
the range of code that I'm interested in

00:10:55.889 --> 00:10:55.899
the range of code that I'm interested in
 

00:10:55.899 --> 00:10:57.509
the range of code that I'm interested in
and I can now drill in and figure out

00:10:57.509 --> 00:10:57.519
and I can now drill in and figure out
 

00:10:57.519 --> 00:10:58.319
and I can now drill in and figure out
what's wrong

00:10:58.319 --> 00:10:58.329
what's wrong
 

00:10:58.329 --> 00:11:01.710
what's wrong
with my layout inflation so that's the

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:01.720
with my layout inflation so that's the
 

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.859
with my layout inflation so that's the
CPU profiler let's move on to the

00:11:03.859 --> 00:11:03.869
CPU profiler let's move on to the
 

00:11:03.869 --> 00:11:09.150
CPU profiler let's move on to the
network profiler so let me scroll out a

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:09.160
network profiler so let me scroll out a
 

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.039
network profiler so let me scroll out a
bit so as Jamel mentioned we have two

00:11:11.039 --> 00:11:11.049
bit so as Jamel mentioned we have two
 

00:11:11.049 --> 00:11:13.499
bit so as Jamel mentioned we have two
new features here we have a threads view

00:11:13.499 --> 00:11:13.509
new features here we have a threads view
 

00:11:13.509 --> 00:11:15.239
new features here we have a threads view
so you can see which thread is doing

00:11:15.239 --> 00:11:15.249
so you can see which thread is doing
 

00:11:15.249 --> 00:11:18.629
so you can see which thread is doing
what some random picture from this app

00:11:18.629 --> 00:11:18.639
what some random picture from this app
 

00:11:18.639 --> 00:11:21.259
what some random picture from this app
we are also showing requests and

00:11:21.259 --> 00:11:21.269
we are also showing requests and
 

00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:24.289
we are also showing requests and
responses for the network profiler in

00:11:24.289 --> 00:11:24.299
responses for the network profiler in
 

00:11:24.299 --> 00:11:27.150
responses for the network profiler in
the memory profiler our biggest new

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:27.160
the memory profiler our biggest new
 

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.639
the memory profiler our biggest new
feature is the ability to show you j'ni

00:11:29.639 --> 00:11:29.649
feature is the ability to show you j'ni
 

00:11:29.649 --> 00:11:32.400
feature is the ability to show you j'ni
references and the allocation trace from

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:32.410
references and the allocation trace from
 

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:35.699
references and the allocation trace from
the day9 references and last but not

00:11:35.699 --> 00:11:35.709
the day9 references and last but not
 

00:11:35.709 --> 00:11:40.859
the day9 references and last but not
least is our new energy profiler when

00:11:40.859 --> 00:11:40.869
least is our new energy profiler when
 

00:11:40.869 --> 00:11:43.470
least is our new energy profiler when
they zoom out a bit so the energy

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:43.480
they zoom out a bit so the energy
 

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.479
they zoom out a bit so the energy
profiler helps me figure out what's

00:11:45.479 --> 00:11:45.489
profiler helps me figure out what's
 

00:11:45.489 --> 00:11:47.939
profiler helps me figure out what's
going on with my battery life so if I

00:11:47.939 --> 00:11:47.949
going on with my battery life so if I
 

00:11:47.949 --> 00:11:50.879
going on with my battery life so if I
take a look earlier in the app here you

00:11:50.879 --> 00:11:50.889
take a look earlier in the app here you
 

00:11:50.889 --> 00:11:53.669
take a look earlier in the app here you
can see we have this legend on top and

00:11:53.669 --> 00:11:53.679
can see we have this legend on top and
 

00:11:53.679 --> 00:11:55.079
can see we have this legend on top and
this is showing me that I have fairly

00:11:55.079 --> 00:11:55.089
this is showing me that I have fairly
 

00:11:55.089 --> 00:11:57.239
this is showing me that I have fairly
light CPU usage but it's telling me if

00:11:57.239 --> 00:11:57.249
light CPU usage but it's telling me if
 

00:11:57.249 --> 00:11:59.340
light CPU usage but it's telling me if
I'm touching the network if I'm getting

00:11:59.340 --> 00:11:59.350
I'm touching the network if I'm getting
 

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:02.220
I'm touching the network if I'm getting
location requests if I'm running alarms

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:02.230
location requests if I'm running alarms
 

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:04.769
location requests if I'm running alarms
and if I have wake locks and if you see

00:12:04.769 --> 00:12:04.779
and if I have wake locks and if you see
 

00:12:04.779 --> 00:12:06.329
and if I have wake locks and if you see
there's this big red bar on the bottom

00:12:06.329 --> 00:12:06.339
there's this big red bar on the bottom
 

00:12:06.339 --> 00:12:08.309
there's this big red bar on the bottom
that's showing there's a wake lock in

00:12:08.309 --> 00:12:08.319
that's showing there's a wake lock in
 

00:12:08.319 --> 00:12:10.350
that's showing there's a wake lock in
effect a wake lock means that the device

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:10.360
effect a wake lock means that the device
 

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.150
effect a wake lock means that the device
cannot go to sleep this is obviously

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:12.160
cannot go to sleep this is obviously
 

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.579
cannot go to sleep this is obviously
really bad for battery life right so

00:12:14.579 --> 00:12:14.589
really bad for battery life right so
 

00:12:14.589 --> 00:12:19.229
really bad for battery life right so
let's look at this range and here it

00:12:19.229 --> 00:12:19.239
let's look at this range and here it
 

00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:21.119
let's look at this range and here it
actually shows me the real way clock

00:12:21.119 --> 00:12:21.129
actually shows me the real way clock
 

00:12:21.129 --> 00:12:23.819
actually shows me the real way clock
names we can see our first wake lock was

00:12:23.819 --> 00:12:23.829
names we can see our first wake lock was
 

00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:26.009
names we can see our first wake lock was
alive for about 4 seconds that's normal

00:12:26.009 --> 00:12:26.019
alive for about 4 seconds that's normal
 

00:12:26.019 --> 00:12:28.829
alive for about 4 seconds that's normal
but the second wake lock still

00:12:28.829 --> 00:12:28.839
but the second wake lock still
 

00:12:28.839 --> 00:12:30.479
but the second wake lock still
unreleased and go on for 50 seconds

00:12:30.479 --> 00:12:30.489
unreleased and go on for 50 seconds
 

00:12:30.489 --> 00:12:32.789
unreleased and go on for 50 seconds
that's not good so what I can do is

00:12:32.789 --> 00:12:32.799
that's not good so what I can do is
 

00:12:32.799 --> 00:12:35.460
that's not good so what I can do is
click on that wake lock and we drill

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:35.470
click on that wake lock and we drill
 

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:38.359
click on that wake lock and we drill
down to where the wake lock was acquired

00:12:38.359 --> 00:12:38.369
down to where the wake lock was acquired
 

00:12:38.369 --> 00:12:41.129
down to where the wake lock was acquired
you can see obviously this is a bug I

00:12:41.129 --> 00:12:41.139
you can see obviously this is a bug I
 

00:12:41.139 --> 00:12:42.749
you can see obviously this is a bug I
added this is not the plaid apps fault

00:12:42.749 --> 00:12:42.759
added this is not the plaid apps fault
 

00:12:42.759 --> 00:12:44.639
added this is not the plaid apps fault
this is just to just show the wake lock

00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:44.649
this is just to just show the wake lock
 

00:12:44.649 --> 00:12:47.909
this is just to just show the wake lock
so the wake lock detector and the whole

00:12:47.909 --> 00:12:47.919
so the wake lock detector and the whole
 

00:12:47.919 --> 00:12:50.159
so the wake lock detector and the whole
energy profiler is new and 3 2 and

00:12:50.159 --> 00:12:50.169
energy profiler is new and 3 2 and
 

00:12:50.169 --> 00:12:52.470
energy profiler is new and 3 2 and
hopefully very useful to you all right

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480
hopefully very useful to you all right
 

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.689
hopefully very useful to you all right
so that's it for the profiler let's talk

00:12:54.689 --> 00:12:54.699
so that's it for the profiler let's talk
 

00:12:54.699 --> 00:12:57.739
so that's it for the profiler let's talk
about the emulator a bit let me stop

00:12:57.739 --> 00:12:57.749
about the emulator a bit let me stop
 

00:12:57.749 --> 00:13:02.189
about the emulator a bit let me stop
profiling alright so here we are in the

00:13:02.189 --> 00:13:02.199
profiling alright so here we are in the
 

00:13:02.199 --> 00:13:03.400
profiling alright so here we are in the
emulator

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:03.410
emulator
 

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:05.710
emulator
we have the new snapshots that you saw

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:05.720
we have the new snapshots that you saw
 

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.689
we have the new snapshots that you saw
earlier and we actually have a whole UI

00:13:07.689 --> 00:13:07.699
earlier and we actually have a whole UI
 

00:13:07.699 --> 00:13:11.199
earlier and we actually have a whole UI
for this so I can see here that my quick

00:13:11.199 --> 00:13:11.209
for this so I can see here that my quick
 

00:13:11.209 --> 00:13:13.749
for this so I can see here that my quick
boot obviously looks like the lockscreen

00:13:13.749 --> 00:13:13.759
boot obviously looks like the lockscreen
 

00:13:13.759 --> 00:13:16.539
boot obviously looks like the lockscreen
right but I've also recorded a session

00:13:16.539 --> 00:13:16.549
right but I've also recorded a session
 

00:13:16.549 --> 00:13:18.309
right but I've also recorded a session
in the middle of searching of Google

00:13:18.309 --> 00:13:18.319
in the middle of searching of Google
 

00:13:18.319 --> 00:13:20.559
in the middle of searching of Google
Maps so I can just click the snapshot

00:13:20.559 --> 00:13:20.569
Maps so I can just click the snapshot
 

00:13:20.569 --> 00:13:22.869
Maps so I can just click the snapshot
press play and my emulators instantly in

00:13:22.869 --> 00:13:22.879
press play and my emulators instantly in
 

00:13:22.879 --> 00:13:25.929
press play and my emulators instantly in
that exact state I also recorded a

00:13:25.929 --> 00:13:25.939
that exact state I also recorded a
 

00:13:25.939 --> 00:13:28.359
that exact state I also recorded a
snapshot while running the clock so

00:13:28.359 --> 00:13:28.369
snapshot while running the clock so
 

00:13:28.369 --> 00:13:29.919
snapshot while running the clock so
again if I press play you can see it's

00:13:29.919 --> 00:13:29.929
again if I press play you can see it's
 

00:13:29.929 --> 00:13:31.419
again if I press play you can see it's
instantly in that state

00:13:31.419 --> 00:13:31.429
instantly in that state
 

00:13:31.429 --> 00:13:33.369
instantly in that state
15 seconds into recording of the

00:13:33.369 --> 00:13:33.379
15 seconds into recording of the
 

00:13:33.379 --> 00:13:35.799
15 seconds into recording of the
snapshot and recording a snapshot is as

00:13:35.799 --> 00:13:35.809
snapshot and recording a snapshot is as
 

00:13:35.809 --> 00:13:37.539
snapshot and recording a snapshot is as
simple as clicking the take snapshot

00:13:37.539 --> 00:13:37.549
simple as clicking the take snapshot
 

00:13:37.549 --> 00:13:39.999
simple as clicking the take snapshot
while you're running your emulator and

00:13:39.999 --> 00:13:40.009
while you're running your emulator and
 

00:13:40.009 --> 00:13:42.309
while you're running your emulator and
then you can bring it back you can see

00:13:42.309 --> 00:13:42.319
then you can bring it back you can see
 

00:13:42.319 --> 00:13:44.849
then you can bring it back you can see
there's also a special quick boot

00:13:44.849 --> 00:13:44.859
there's also a special quick boot
 

00:13:44.859 --> 00:13:47.529
there's also a special quick boot
snapshot right that's the one that

00:13:47.529 --> 00:13:47.539
snapshot right that's the one that
 

00:13:47.539 --> 00:13:48.939
snapshot right that's the one that
emulator is going to come back into when

00:13:48.939 --> 00:13:48.949
emulator is going to come back into when
 

00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:51.279
emulator is going to come back into when
you restart it so if I exit the emulator

00:13:51.279 --> 00:13:51.289
you restart it so if I exit the emulator
 

00:13:51.289 --> 00:13:56.019
you restart it so if I exit the emulator
right now and bring it back up you

00:13:56.019 --> 00:13:56.029
right now and bring it back up you
 

00:13:56.029 --> 00:13:57.909
right now and bring it back up you
should see that yes you know it comes

00:13:57.909 --> 00:13:57.919
should see that yes you know it comes
 

00:13:57.919 --> 00:14:00.819
should see that yes you know it comes
back really quickly we've added a few

00:14:00.819 --> 00:14:00.829
back really quickly we've added a few
 

00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:03.249
back really quickly we've added a few
other features to the emulator so by

00:14:03.249 --> 00:14:03.259
other features to the emulator so by
 

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:06.639
other features to the emulator so by
popular demand screen recording a lot of

00:14:06.639 --> 00:14:06.649
popular demand screen recording a lot of
 

00:14:06.649 --> 00:14:08.259
popular demand screen recording a lot of
you wanted this this lets you record a

00:14:08.259 --> 00:14:08.269
you wanted this this lets you record a
 

00:14:08.269 --> 00:14:10.119
you wanted this this lets you record a
video what's happening along with audio

00:14:10.119 --> 00:14:10.129
video what's happening along with audio
 

00:14:10.129 --> 00:14:13.929
video what's happening along with audio
and we've also enhanced the camera so

00:14:13.929 --> 00:14:13.939
and we've also enhanced the camera so
 

00:14:13.939 --> 00:14:19.570
and we've also enhanced the camera so
let me start the camera

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:19.580
 
 

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:24.080
 
yes yes all right so what we've done

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:24.090
yes yes all right so what we've done
 

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:27.530
yes yes all right so what we've done
here is we are now feeding the camera

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:27.540
here is we are now feeding the camera
 

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.960
here is we are now feeding the camera
and the emulator sensors you know the

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:29.970
and the emulator sensors you know the
 

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:32.540
and the emulator sensors you know the
the fiction that you're in this 3d world

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:32.550
the fiction that you're in this 3d world
 

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:34.640
the fiction that you're in this 3d world
here so actually I gotta have to hold

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:34.650
here so actually I gotta have to hold
 

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:37.010
here so actually I gotta have to hold
alt key so I can move around in this 3d

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:37.020
alt key so I can move around in this 3d
 

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.750
alt key so I can move around in this 3d
scene and this is really really

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:38.760
scene and this is really really
 

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.610
scene and this is really really
important when you're building a are

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:40.620
important when you're building a are
 

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:45.590
important when you're building a are
apps and speaking of AR and we have some

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600
apps and speaking of AR and we have some
 

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.600
apps and speaking of AR and we have some
support back in the IDE for that so

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:49.610
support back in the IDE for that so
 

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:54.470
support back in the IDE for that so
let's see this is a gltf file and we

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480
let's see this is a gltf file and we
 

00:14:54.480 --> 00:15:00.290
let's see this is a gltf file and we
have a plugin let me see settings we

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:00.300
have a plugin let me see settings we
 

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:02.270
have a plugin let me see settings we
have this scene form plug-in so you

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:02.280
have this scene form plug-in so you
 

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.560
have this scene form plug-in so you
heard about scene form in the keynote a

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:03.570
heard about scene form in the keynote a
 

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.330
heard about scene form in the keynote a
scene from plugin which helps you

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:05.340
scene from plugin which helps you
 

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:08.540
scene from plugin which helps you
preview your 3d models so here's this

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:08.550
preview your 3d models so here's this
 

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:10.910
preview your 3d models so here's this
gltf file i can go in and import this as

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:10.920
gltf file i can go in and import this as
 

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.540
gltf file i can go in and import this as
a scene form asset we support gltf files

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:14.550
a scene form asset we support gltf files
 

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:16.850
a scene form asset we support gltf files
to support obj files we support FBX

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:16.860
to support obj files we support FBX
 

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:20.330
to support obj files we support FBX
files and so when I run this import it's

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:20.340
files and so when I run this import it's
 

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:24.920
files and so when I run this import it's
going to create a Gradle task for me

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:24.930
going to create a Gradle task for me
 

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:28.250
going to create a Gradle task for me
which is creating these sfas FB files

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:28.260
which is creating these sfas FB files
 

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.100
which is creating these sfas FB files
that is Korca scene form and then I can

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:31.110
that is Korca scene form and then I can
 

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:33.200
that is Korca scene form and then I can
open my SFA file and the important part

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:33.210
open my SFA file and the important part
 

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:37.370
open my SFA file and the important part
here is that we have a viewer tada so

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:37.380
here is that we have a viewer tada so
 

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:40.490
here is that we have a viewer tada so
now I can explore what's going on in a

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:40.500
now I can explore what's going on in a
 

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:43.750
now I can explore what's going on in a
3d sense what this model is doing

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:43.760
3d sense what this model is doing
 

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:46.730
3d sense what this model is doing
alright so that's seen for me let's

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:46.740
alright so that's seen for me let's
 

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:48.920
alright so that's seen for me let's
switch gears a bit and talk about

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:48.930
switch gears a bit and talk about
 

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:54.260
switch gears a bit and talk about
jetpack so if you look at the package

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:54.270
jetpack so if you look at the package
 

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:56.270
jetpack so if you look at the package
names in the editor here you can see

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:56.280
names in the editor here you can see
 

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:57.980
names in the editor here you can see
that we have Andrew dot support we have

00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:57.990
that we have Andrew dot support we have
 

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:01.190
that we have Andrew dot support we have
some v4 some v7 these are super

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:01.200
some v4 some v7 these are super
 

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.620
some v4 some v7 these are super
misleading version numbers right and so

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:03.630
misleading version numbers right and so
 

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:04.970
misleading version numbers right and so
we decided we needed to clean up our

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:04.980
we decided we needed to clean up our
 

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:07.850
we decided we needed to clean up our
legacy a bit and so we are repackaging

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:07.860
legacy a bit and so we are repackaging
 

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.590
legacy a bit and so we are repackaging
everything from Android support over to

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:09.600
everything from Android support over to
 

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:13.220
everything from Android support over to
Android X and to help with that

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:13.230
Android X and to help with that
 

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:15.650
Android X and to help with that
migration we're providing all of our

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:15.660
migration we're providing all of our
 

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.120
migration we're providing all of our
libraries in both your old name space

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:17.130
libraries in both your old name space
 

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:18.950
libraries in both your old name space
and the new space namespace for now as

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:18.960
and the new space namespace for now as
 

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.050

well as they automated refactoring tool
 

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:24.260
well as they automated refactoring tool
so let me show you how that works by the

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:24.270
so let me show you how that works by the
 

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:26.690
so let me show you how that works by the
way this also applies to XML files where

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:26.700
way this also applies to XML files where
 

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.820
way this also applies to XML files where
you have these class names and even

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:28.830
you have these class names and even
 

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:30.380
you have these class names and even
Gradle files because we are also

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:30.390
Gradle files because we are also
 

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:33.300
Gradle files because we are also
repackaging the group IDs and artifact

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:33.310
repackaging the group IDs and artifact
 

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:37.880
repackaging the group IDs and artifact
for these libraries so I go to refactor

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:37.890
for these libraries so I go to refactor
 

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:40.890
for these libraries so I go to refactor
refactor Android X it's gonna look

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:40.900
refactor Android X it's gonna look
 

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.050
refactor Android X it's gonna look
through the code then it's gonna offer

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:43.060
through the code then it's gonna offer
 

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:47.810
through the code then it's gonna offer
to preview the changes I'm feelin lucky

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:47.820
 
 

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:50.310
 
so you can see here actually let me open

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:50.320
so you can see here actually let me open
 

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.710
so you can see here actually let me open
up the get view and I highly highly

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:52.720
up the get view and I highly highly
 

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.630
up the get view and I highly highly
highly recommend that you all make

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:54.640
highly recommend that you all make
 

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.970
highly recommend that you all make
backups and use version control both

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:56.980
backups and use version control both
 

00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:00.480
backups and use version control both
preferably before you do this so you can

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:00.490
preferably before you do this so you can
 

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:02.010
preferably before you do this so you can
see that we've actually replaced a bunch

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:02.020
see that we've actually replaced a bunch
 

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:05.400
see that we've actually replaced a bunch
of the code here and it should work but

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:05.410
of the code here and it should work but
 

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:08.189
of the code here and it should work but
we are aware of some bugs already in

00:17:08.189 --> 00:17:08.199
we are aware of some bugs already in
 

00:17:08.199 --> 00:17:10.920
we are aware of some bugs already in
Seaforth in canary 14 any canary 15 so

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:10.930
Seaforth in canary 14 any canary 15 so
 

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:12.660
Seaforth in canary 14 any canary 15 so
we would really like you to try this and

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:12.670
we would really like you to try this and
 

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:14.220
we would really like you to try this and
give a sweet feedback on what's broken

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:14.230
give a sweet feedback on what's broken
 

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:15.870
give a sweet feedback on what's broken
so that we can make this working

00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:15.880
so that we can make this working
 

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.870
so that we can make this working
smoothly for everyone before 3/2 goes to

00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:18.880
smoothly for everyone before 3/2 goes to
 

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:21.860
smoothly for everyone before 3/2 goes to
stable all right

00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:21.870
stable all right
 

00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:24.800
stable all right
so jetpack is about a lot more than

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:24.810
so jetpack is about a lot more than
 

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:27.750
so jetpack is about a lot more than
cleaning up legacy code we are adding a

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:27.760
cleaning up legacy code we are adding a
 

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.840
cleaning up legacy code we are adding a
number of new libraries and one of the

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:30.850
number of new libraries and one of the
 

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:32.760
number of new libraries and one of the
most important ones for the tools anyway

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:32.770
most important ones for the tools anyway
 

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:38.430
most important ones for the tools anyway
is the navigation library so the new

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:38.440
is the navigation library so the new
 

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.860
is the navigation library so the new
navigation library does require you to

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:40.870
navigation library does require you to
 

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:42.810
navigation library does require you to
architect your app for the navigation

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:42.820
architect your app for the navigation
 

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:44.460
architect your app for the navigation
library from the beginning so this is

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:44.470
library from the beginning so this is
 

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:47.220
library from the beginning so this is
not magically machine learn intelligence

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:47.230
not magically machine learn intelligence
 

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:48.570
not magically machine learn intelligence
figuring out what your apps doing okay

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:48.580
figuring out what your apps doing okay
 

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.280
figuring out what your apps doing okay
this is a navigation graph we have

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:50.290
this is a navigation graph we have
 

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:53.130
this is a navigation graph we have
created for this app so let me show you

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:53.140
created for this app so let me show you
 

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:55.140
created for this app so let me show you
how the navigation library works the

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:55.150
how the navigation library works the
 

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:59.430
how the navigation library works the
plumbing underneath it first so I have a

00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440
plumbing underneath it first so I have a
 

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:02.490
plumbing underneath it first so I have a
launcher activity i point that launcher

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:02.500
launcher activity i point that launcher
 

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:06.450
launcher activity i point that launcher
activity to a sort of route layout and

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:06.460
activity to a sort of route layout and
 

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.430
activity to a sort of route layout and
in that layout all I do is I put a

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:08.440
in that layout all I do is I put a
 

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:11.640
in that layout all I do is I put a
navigation host fragment and this

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:11.650
navigation host fragment and this
 

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:13.380
navigation host fragment and this
navigational post fragment will do the

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:13.390
navigational post fragment will do the
 

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:15.930
navigational post fragment will do the
dynamic dispatching at runtime and then

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:15.940
dynamic dispatching at runtime and then
 

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:18.180
dynamic dispatching at runtime and then
we point the nav host fragment to this

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:18.190
we point the nav host fragment to this
 

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:20.640
we point the nav host fragment to this
navigation resource file that's a new

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:20.650
navigation resource file that's a new
 

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:22.620
navigation resource file that's a new
resource type that we've added for this

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:22.630
resource type that we've added for this
 

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:24.840
resource type that we've added for this
specific library so now we're looking

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:24.850
specific library so now we're looking
 

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:26.490
specific library so now we're looking
back at the navigation resource file

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:26.500
back at the navigation resource file
 

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.050
back at the navigation resource file
it's just an XML file that we have a

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:28.060
it's just an XML file that we have a
 

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.210
it's just an XML file that we have a
nice visualizer for it so let me

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:30.220
nice visualizer for it so let me
 

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:33.660
nice visualizer for it so let me
actually go ahead and run the app so if

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:33.670
actually go ahead and run the app so if
 

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:36.780
actually go ahead and run the app so if
you look carefully you can see that near

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:36.790
you look carefully you can see that near
 

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:39.180
you look carefully you can see that near
my the mouse pointer there's a little

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:39.190
my the mouse pointer there's a little

is the start the start destination in
 

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:46.269
is the start the start destination in
the

I can just go to the title screen

00:18:48.639 --> 00:18:48.649
I can just go to the title screen
 

00:18:48.649 --> 00:18:50.440
I can just go to the title screen
instead and click on set start

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:50.450
instead and click on set start
 

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:55.119
instead and click on set start
destination and when I run again you'll

destination and when I run again you'll
see that now the app instead starts on

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:57.080
see that now the app instead starts on
 

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:59.619
see that now the app instead starts on
the title screen I didn't change the

00:18:59.619 --> 00:18:59.629
the title screen I didn't change the
 

00:18:59.629 --> 00:19:01.659
the title screen I didn't change the
launcher activity or anything else all I

00:19:01.659 --> 00:19:01.669
launcher activity or anything else all I
 

00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:03.789
launcher activity or anything else all I
changed was the navigation graph so that

00:19:03.789 --> 00:19:03.799
changed was the navigation graph so that
 

00:19:03.799 --> 00:19:06.269
changed was the navigation graph so that
tells the nav fragment were to begin

00:19:06.269 --> 00:19:06.279
tells the nav fragment were to begin
 

00:19:06.279 --> 00:19:09.249
tells the nav fragment were to begin
alright so next I'm gonna click the play

00:19:09.249 --> 00:19:09.259
alright so next I'm gonna click the play
 

00:19:09.259 --> 00:19:11.889
alright so next I'm gonna click the play
button and it does nothing why is that

00:19:11.889 --> 00:19:11.899
button and it does nothing why is that
 

00:19:11.899 --> 00:19:14.529
button and it does nothing why is that
well the play button is just a button in

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:14.539
well the play button is just a button in
 

00:19:14.539 --> 00:19:16.779
well the play button is just a button in
this layout right so if you look at this

00:19:16.779 --> 00:19:16.789
this layout right so if you look at this
 

00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:18.820
this layout right so if you look at this
layout there are two arrows coming out

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:18.830
layout there are two arrows coming out
 

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:22.479
layout there are two arrows coming out
of it right the first one on top here

00:19:22.479 --> 00:19:22.489
of it right the first one on top here
 

00:19:22.489 --> 00:19:25.060
of it right the first one on top here
has the action play that's one of the

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:25.070
has the action play that's one of the
 

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:26.169
has the action play that's one of the
things we want to navigate when the

00:19:26.169 --> 00:19:26.179
things we want to navigate when the
 

00:19:26.179 --> 00:19:27.969
things we want to navigate when the
action play happens we wanted to go to

00:19:27.969 --> 00:19:27.979
action play happens we wanted to go to
 

00:19:27.979 --> 00:19:30.190
action play happens we wanted to go to
this page when the action leaderboard

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:30.200
this page when the action leaderboard
 

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.839
this page when the action leaderboard
happens we wanted to go over here so

00:19:31.839 --> 00:19:31.849
happens we wanted to go over here so
 

00:19:31.849 --> 00:19:33.279
happens we wanted to go over here so
let's go take a look at the code so I'm

00:19:33.279 --> 00:19:33.289
let's go take a look at the code so I'm
 

00:19:33.289 --> 00:19:34.959
let's go take a look at the code so I'm
gonna drill into the layout by just

00:19:34.959 --> 00:19:34.969
gonna drill into the layout by just
 

00:19:34.969 --> 00:19:37.839
gonna drill into the layout by just
double-clicking so here's our button and

00:19:37.839 --> 00:19:37.849
double-clicking so here's our button and
 

00:19:37.849 --> 00:19:40.719
double-clicking so here's our button and
I'm gonna jump to the on click handler

00:19:40.719 --> 00:19:40.729
I'm gonna jump to the on click handler
 

00:19:40.729 --> 00:19:42.669
I'm gonna jump to the on click handler
for that button it's called on play and

00:19:42.669 --> 00:19:42.679
for that button it's called on play and
 

00:19:42.679 --> 00:19:45.849
for that button it's called on play and
I'm going to uncomment this code so what

00:19:45.849 --> 00:19:45.859
I'm going to uncomment this code so what
 

00:19:45.859 --> 00:19:47.769
I'm going to uncomment this code so what
we're doing here is we're finding the

00:19:47.769 --> 00:19:47.779
we're doing here is we're finding the
 

00:19:47.779 --> 00:19:49.029
we're doing here is we're finding the
nav controller that's from the

00:19:49.029 --> 00:19:49.039
nav controller that's from the
 

00:19:49.039 --> 00:19:51.459
nav controller that's from the
navigation library and this is Kotlin so

00:19:51.459 --> 00:19:51.469
navigation library and this is Kotlin so
 

00:19:51.469 --> 00:19:52.749
navigation library and this is Kotlin so
we have an extension method right there

00:19:52.749 --> 00:19:52.759
we have an extension method right there
 

00:19:52.759 --> 00:19:54.249
we have an extension method right there
on the view but in Java you could just

00:19:54.249 --> 00:19:54.259
on the view but in Java you could just
 

00:19:54.259 --> 00:19:57.310
on the view but in Java you could just
call the navigation helper so we get the

00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:57.320
call the navigation helper so we get the
 

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.019
call the navigation helper so we get the
nav controller and we say navigate to

00:19:59.019 --> 00:19:59.029
nav controller and we say navigate to
 

00:19:59.029 --> 00:20:01.779
nav controller and we say navigate to
the action play all right so now I'm

00:20:01.779 --> 00:20:01.789
the action play all right so now I'm
 

00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:06.700
the action play all right so now I'm
gonna deploy that to the app and once

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:06.710
gonna deploy that to the app and once
 

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:08.829
gonna deploy that to the app and once
that gets there I can now press play and

00:20:08.829 --> 00:20:08.839
that gets there I can now press play and
 

00:20:08.839 --> 00:20:11.649
that gets there I can now press play and
you can see it goes where we want so I

00:20:11.649 --> 00:20:11.659
you can see it goes where we want so I
 

00:20:11.659 --> 00:20:14.339
you can see it goes where we want so I
can now go back into the navigation

00:20:14.339 --> 00:20:14.349
can now go back into the navigation
 

00:20:14.349 --> 00:20:17.919
can now go back into the navigation
screen and instead of jumping when I

00:20:17.919 --> 00:20:17.929
screen and instead of jumping when I
 

00:20:17.929 --> 00:20:19.329
screen and instead of jumping when I
press play instead of jumping to the

00:20:19.329 --> 00:20:19.339
press play instead of jumping to the
 

00:20:19.339 --> 00:20:21.009
press play instead of jumping to the
register thing I'm gonna have it jump

00:20:21.009 --> 00:20:21.019
register thing I'm gonna have it jump
 

00:20:21.019 --> 00:20:25.779
register thing I'm gonna have it jump
over to our in-game screen instead so

00:20:25.779 --> 00:20:25.789
over to our in-game screen instead so
 

00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:27.940
over to our in-game screen instead so
I'll just make that change notice the

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:27.950
I'll just make that change notice the
 

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:29.320
I'll just make that change notice the
code doesn't change the code just says

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:29.330
code doesn't change the code just says
 

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:31.169
code doesn't change the code just says
take the play action

00:20:31.169 --> 00:20:31.179
take the play action
 

00:20:31.179 --> 00:20:34.959
take the play action
alright so now when I press play instead

00:20:34.959 --> 00:20:34.969
alright so now when I press play instead
 

00:20:34.969 --> 00:20:37.239
alright so now when I press play instead
we go right into the game right so that

00:20:37.239 --> 00:20:37.249
we go right into the game right so that
 

00:20:37.249 --> 00:20:41.560
we go right into the game right so that
the routing table is here another thing

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:41.570
the routing table is here another thing
 

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:44.109
the routing table is here another thing
we can do is to select this transition

00:20:44.109 --> 00:20:44.119
we can do is to select this transition
 

00:20:44.119 --> 00:20:46.029
we can do is to select this transition
and say you know what I like an

00:20:46.029 --> 00:20:46.039
and say you know what I like an
 

00:20:46.039 --> 00:20:47.889
and say you know what I like an
animation on this transition so I'm

00:20:47.889 --> 00:20:47.899
animation on this transition so I'm
 

00:20:47.899 --> 00:20:50.259
animation on this transition so I'm
gonna choose the rotate cross to tick

00:20:50.259 --> 00:20:50.269
gonna choose the rotate cross to tick
 

00:20:50.269 --> 00:20:52.629
gonna choose the rotate cross to tick
animation and again I'm gonna deploy

00:20:52.629 --> 00:20:52.639
animation and again I'm gonna deploy
 

00:20:52.639 --> 00:20:55.419
animation and again I'm gonna deploy
that to the device and when I press play

00:20:55.419 --> 00:20:55.429
that to the device and when I press play
 

00:20:55.429 --> 00:20:57.430
that to the device and when I press play
now look at the screen you can see it

00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:57.440
now look at the screen you can see it
 

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.470
now look at the screen you can see it
rotates right

00:20:59.470 --> 00:20:59.480
rotates right
 

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.420
rotates right
so there's a lot of features in the

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:01.430
so there's a lot of features in the
 

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:03.430
so there's a lot of features in the
navigator that I'm not getting into for

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:03.440
navigator that I'm not getting into for
 

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.890
navigator that I'm not getting into for
example passing arguments in a safe way

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:05.900
example passing arguments in a safe way
 

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.990
example passing arguments in a safe way
from one screen to another or nesting

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000
from one screen to another or nesting
 

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.800
from one screen to another or nesting
graphs I'll just show one last thing

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:10.810
graphs I'll just show one last thing
 

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:13.420
graphs I'll just show one last thing
deep links so I'm going to press the

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:13.430
deep links so I'm going to press the
 

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:15.270
deep links so I'm going to press the
plus button here to create a deep link

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:15.280
plus button here to create a deep link
 

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.380
plus button here to create a deep link
and let's pretend for a moment that I

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:17.390
and let's pretend for a moment that I
 

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:22.270
and let's pretend for a moment that I
own the google.com domain so if I look

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:22.280
own the google.com domain so if I look
 

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:25.240
own the google.com domain so if I look
at the manifest file here all I've done

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:25.250
at the manifest file here all I've done
 

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:27.910
at the manifest file here all I've done
in the manifest is register my activity

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:27.920
in the manifest is register my activity
 

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.130
in the manifest is register my activity
with a launcher intent and also I

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:30.140
with a launcher intent and also I
 

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:32.440
with a launcher intent and also I
reference the Navagraha but now let's

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:32.450
reference the Navagraha but now let's
 

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:34.330
reference the Navagraha but now let's
take a look at the merged manifest right

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:34.340
take a look at the merged manifest right
 

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:36.460
take a look at the merged manifest right
this is what we compute on the fly when

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:36.470
this is what we compute on the fly when
 

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:38.200
this is what we compute on the fly when
you build and we also compute in the IDE

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:38.210
you build and we also compute in the IDE
 

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:40.240
you build and we also compute in the IDE
obviously if you look at the bottom here

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:40.250
obviously if you look at the bottom here
 

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:43.030
obviously if you look at the bottom here
we create intent filters for you that

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:43.040
we create intent filters for you that
 

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.430
we create intent filters for you that
are handling this deep link right so you

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:45.440
are handling this deep link right so you
 

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.750
are handling this deep link right so you
just put the deep link and you have file

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:46.760
just put the deep link and you have file
 

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:49.030
just put the deep link and you have file
and now your app will respond to deep

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:49.040
and now your app will respond to deep
 

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.670
and now your app will respond to deep
links so that's a navigator which is new

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:51.680
links so that's a navigator which is new
 

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:56.110
links so that's a navigator which is new
in 3.2 let's talk about the layout

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:56.120
in 3.2 let's talk about the layout
 

00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:02.500
in 3.2 let's talk about the layout
editor for a bit so as you can see you

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:02.510
editor for a bit so as you can see you
 

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:05.320
editor for a bit so as you can see you
get this nice graphical view of the app

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:05.330
get this nice graphical view of the app
 

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:07.420
get this nice graphical view of the app
well the reason that works is that we

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:07.430
well the reason that works is that we
 

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:09.700
well the reason that works is that we
have a highly visual app here right so

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:09.710
have a highly visual app here right so
 

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:11.470
have a highly visual app here right so
you can sort of see from the outline

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:11.480
you can sort of see from the outline
 

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.810
you can sort of see from the outline
what it looks like sometimes you're not

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:13.820
what it looks like sometimes you're not
 

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:14.350
what it looks like sometimes you're not
that lucky

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:14.360
that lucky
 

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.450
that lucky
but what really helps is you can add

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:16.460
but what really helps is you can add
 

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:19.540
but what really helps is you can add
sample data to your app we've had the

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:19.550
sample data to your app we've had the
 

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:21.250
sample data to your app we've had the
plumbing for sample data for quite a

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:21.260
plumbing for sample data for quite a
 

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:22.570
plumbing for sample data for quite a
while but in this release we made it a

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:22.580
while but in this release we made it a
 

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:24.820
while but in this release we made it a
lot easier to use so first of all I can

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:24.830
lot easier to use so first of all I can
 

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:26.380
lot easier to use so first of all I can
go over in the property sheet and you

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:26.390
go over in the property sheet and you
 

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:28.240
go over in the property sheet and you
can see next to the text property we

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:28.250
can see next to the text property we
 

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:31.300
can see next to the text property we
have this design-time property I'm going

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:31.310
have this design-time property I'm going
 

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:32.410
have this design-time property I'm going
to bring up the customizer

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:32.420
to bring up the customizer
 

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:35.590
to bring up the customizer
and here I can explore all the different

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:35.600
and here I can explore all the different
 

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:39.700
and here I can explore all the different
sample data types we have so for this

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:39.710
sample data types we have so for this
 

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:44.410
sample data types we have so for this
one I'm gonna choose a full name I can

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:44.420
one I'm gonna choose a full name I can
 

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:47.020
one I'm gonna choose a full name I can
also select a widget in the design

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:47.030
also select a widget in the design
 

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:48.300
also select a widget in the design
surface and if you look carefully

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:48.310
surface and if you look carefully
 

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:50.260
surface and if you look carefully
whenever you select something there are

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:50.270
whenever you select something there are
 

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:53.380
whenever you select something there are
four buttons under it right the fourth

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:53.390
four buttons under it right the fourth
 

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:55.360
four buttons under it right the fourth
icon is a wrench

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:55.370
icon is a wrench
 

00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:58.600
icon is a wrench
that means design-time attributes all

00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:58.610
that means design-time attributes all
 

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:00.370
that means design-time attributes all
right so I can click on that and I can

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:00.380
right so I can click on that and I can
 

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.140
right so I can click on that and I can
also set design time attributes from

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:02.150
also set design time attributes from
 

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:04.150
also set design time attributes from
here and the reasons the reason it's

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:04.160
here and the reasons the reason it's
 

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.500
here and the reasons the reason it's
important to know about that trick is

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:05.510
important to know about that trick is
 

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:07.660
important to know about that trick is
that it's particularly useful with lists

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:07.670
that it's particularly useful with lists
 

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:11.230
that it's particularly useful with lists
so let me open up a blank layout

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:11.240
so let me open up a blank layout
 

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:16.210
so let me open up a blank layout
and drag in a recyclerview and that

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:16.220
and drag in a recyclerview and that
 

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:17.919
and drag in a recyclerview and that
looks really unimpressive right this is

00:23:17.919 --> 00:23:17.929
looks really unimpressive right this is
 

00:23:17.929 --> 00:23:19.000
looks really unimpressive right this is
what you get with the recyclerview

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:19.010
what you get with the recyclerview
 

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:21.760
what you get with the recyclerview
but now notice that below the recycle we

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:21.770
but now notice that below the recycle we
 

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:23.560
but now notice that below the recycle we
we have our wrench again so I'm gonna

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:23.570
we have our wrench again so I'm gonna
 

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:26.169
we have our wrench again so I'm gonna
press it this is our design time helper

00:23:26.169 --> 00:23:26.179
press it this is our design time helper
 

00:23:26.179 --> 00:23:29.049
press it this is our design time helper
and for list views in recycler views we

00:23:29.049 --> 00:23:29.059
and for list views in recycler views we
 

00:23:29.059 --> 00:23:31.390
and for list views in recycler views we
offer to customize the item list layouts

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:31.400
offer to customize the item list layouts
 

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:35.110
offer to customize the item list layouts
for you so if I press next I can cycle

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120
for you so if I press next I can cycle
 

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.460
for you so if I press next I can cycle
through the various list item layout

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:36.470
through the various list item layout
 

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:38.500
through the various list item layout
here so we create one that looks sort of

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:38.510
here so we create one that looks sort of
 

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:42.070
here so we create one that looks sort of
email list like one-liners two liners

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:42.080
email list like one-liners two liners
 

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:46.180
email list like one-liners two liners
three liners we even have a grid so the

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:46.190
three liners we even have a grid so the
 

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:49.660
three liners we even have a grid so the
design done helpers should help you make

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:49.670
design done helpers should help you make
 

00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:51.640
design done helpers should help you make
your layouts look better from the

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:51.650
your layouts look better from the
 

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:54.250
your layouts look better from the
navigators least the last thing I'll

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:54.260
navigators least the last thing I'll
 

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:57.790
navigators least the last thing I'll
mention on the layout editor is that we

00:23:57.790 --> 00:23:57.800
mention on the layout editor is that we
 

00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:59.799
mention on the layout editor is that we
also have some support for material

00:23:59.799 --> 00:23:59.809
also have some support for material
 

00:23:59.809 --> 00:24:03.490
also have some support for material
theming so here's a pretend compost

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:03.500
theming so here's a pretend compost
 

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.560
theming so here's a pretend compost
window in an email app so we have the

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:05.570
window in an email app so we have the
 

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:07.750
window in an email app so we have the
new chip widgets we have the bottom nav

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:07.760
new chip widgets we have the bottom nav
 

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.370
new chip widgets we have the bottom nav
layout you can see the put the sort of

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:09.380
layout you can see the put the sort of
 

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:13.960
layout you can see the put the sort of
rounded curve and everything I've shown

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:13.970
rounded curve and everything I've shown
 

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:16.960
rounded curve and everything I've shown
you so far is in NRC two or three point

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:16.970
you so far is in NRC two or three point
 

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:18.790
you so far is in NRC two or three point
two now I'm gonna give you a sneak

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:18.800
two now I'm gonna give you a sneak
 

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.549
two now I'm gonna give you a sneak
preview of a feature for an upcoming

00:24:21.549 --> 00:24:21.559
preview of a feature for an upcoming
 

00:24:21.559 --> 00:24:27.340
preview of a feature for an upcoming
release might not even be 3/3 so I'm

00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:27.350
release might not even be 3/3 so I'm
 

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:31.680
release might not even be 3/3 so I'm
gonna open up a new layout for that and

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:31.690
 
 

00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:33.880
 
the problem we're trying to solve is

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:33.890
the problem we're trying to solve is
 

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:37.810
the problem we're trying to solve is
making animation easier so what I have

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:37.820
making animation easier so what I have
 

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:41.440
making animation easier so what I have
here is a a sub class I think of

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:41.450
here is a a sub class I think of
 

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:43.120
here is a a sub class I think of
constraint layout it's sort of next

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:43.130
constraint layout it's sort of next
 

00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:45.520
constraint layout it's sort of next
generation constraint layout which lets

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:45.530
generation constraint layout which lets
 

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:49.630
generation constraint layout which lets
you do motion so I can select my widget

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:49.640
you do motion so I can select my widget
 

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.450
you do motion so I can select my widget
and it has two constraint sets so in the

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:52.460
and it has two constraint sets so in the
 

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:54.520
and it has two constraint sets so in the
beginning it's attached to bottom left

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:54.530
beginning it's attached to bottom left
 

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:57.640
beginning it's attached to bottom left
at the end it's attached bottom right at

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:57.650
at the end it's attached bottom right at
 

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:01.000
at the end it's attached bottom right at
top right so I can play and you can see

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:01.010
top right so I can play and you can see
 

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:02.350
top right so I can play and you can see
we can animate between these two

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:02.360
we can animate between these two
 

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:04.690
we can animate between these two
constraints outs let me actually go and

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:04.700
constraints outs let me actually go and
 

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:07.840
constraints outs let me actually go and
turn on motion paths so we can see

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:07.850
turn on motion paths so we can see
 

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:11.410
turn on motion paths so we can see
what's going on so now we can see where

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:11.420
what's going on so now we can see where
 

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:13.780
what's going on so now we can see where
this thing is gonna go now the important

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:13.790
this thing is gonna go now the important
 

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:17.790
this thing is gonna go now the important
part is I can go in and add keyframes so

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:17.800
part is I can go in and add keyframes so
 

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:22.810
part is I can go in and add keyframes so
I'll add a Cartesian position keyframe

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:22.820
I'll add a Cartesian position keyframe
 

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:25.840
I'll add a Cartesian position keyframe
and I will you know we can drag it over

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:25.850
and I will you know we can drag it over
 

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:28.720
and I will you know we can drag it over
here for example and I'll add one more

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:28.730
here for example and I'll add one more
 

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:32.380
here for example and I'll add one more
keyframe to rotate so we'll set a random

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:32.390
keyframe to rotate so we'll set a random
 

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:35.620
keyframe to rotate so we'll set a random
attribute actually I want to do it

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:35.630
attribute actually I want to do it
 

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:38.380
attribute actually I want to do it
somewhere else so that it's more obvious

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:38.390
somewhere else so that it's more obvious
 

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:43.830
somewhere else so that it's more obvious
so I'll add a new keyframe Oh over here

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840
so I'll add a new keyframe Oh over here
 

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:49.990
so I'll add a new keyframe Oh over here
so let's see new attribute and I have to

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000
so let's see new attribute and I have to
 

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.470
so let's see new attribute and I have to
select it and then we will say rotation

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:53.480
select it and then we will say rotation
 

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.350
select it and then we will say rotation
should be yeah 45 is a good default so

00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:56.360
should be yeah 45 is a good default so
 

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.990
should be yeah 45 is a good default so
you can see now when I'm dragging

00:25:58.990 --> 00:25:59.000
you can see now when I'm dragging
 

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.770
you can see now when I'm dragging
through you can see we both rotate and

00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:01.780
through you can see we both rotate and
 

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:05.170
through you can see we both rotate and
and shift the X&amp;Y coordinates and the

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:05.180
and shift the X&amp;Y coordinates and the
 

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:07.750
and shift the X&amp;Y coordinates and the
real power here is when we start

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:07.760
real power here is when we start
 

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.570
real power here is when we start
combining these right so here is a more

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:10.580
combining these right so here is a more
 

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:14.380
combining these right so here is a more
complicated animation demo you can see

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:14.390
complicated animation demo you can see
 

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:16.090
complicated animation demo you can see
here let me make the timeline a bit

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:16.100
here let me make the timeline a bit
 

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.340
here let me make the timeline a bit
bigger here we have a number of things

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:18.350
bigger here we have a number of things
 

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:22.180
bigger here we have a number of things
happening so at the beginning we have a

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:22.190
happening so at the beginning we have a
 

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:24.160
happening so at the beginning we have a
number of widgets at the end you can see

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:24.170
number of widgets at the end you can see
 

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:26.290
number of widgets at the end you can see
we moved the motion layout we've faded

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:26.300
we moved the motion layout we've faded
 

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:29.770
we moved the motion layout we've faded
out the Google cast icon and we made the

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:29.780
out the Google cast icon and we made the
 

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:31.900
out the Google cast icon and we made the
header smaller so you can see as I'm

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:31.910
header smaller so you can see as I'm
 

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:35.200
header smaller so you can see as I'm
pulling through you know we get pretty

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:35.210
pulling through you know we get pretty
 

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:38.140
pulling through you know we get pretty
fancy effects and this library also lets

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:38.150
fancy effects and this library also lets
 

00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:40.300
fancy effects and this library also lets
you respond to touch events which makes

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:40.310
you respond to touch events which makes
 

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:44.500
you respond to touch events which makes
it a lot easier to to use so that's

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:44.510
it a lot easier to to use so that's
 

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:45.400
it a lot easier to to use so that's
motion layout

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:45.410
motion layout
 

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:47.470
motion layout
no promises someone it'll be done but

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:47.480
no promises someone it'll be done but
 

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:49.480
no promises someone it'll be done but
you know we're very excited about this

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:49.490
you know we're very excited about this
 

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:50.880
you know we're very excited about this
and working hard on it

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:50.890
and working hard on it
 

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:58.359
and working hard on it
so now thank you

00:26:58.359 --> 00:26:58.369
 
 

00:26:58.369 --> 00:27:00.739
 
so now if we can switch to the other

00:27:00.739 --> 00:27:00.749
so now if we can switch to the other
 

00:27:00.749 --> 00:27:05.049
so now if we can switch to the other
demo machine for a second alright so

00:27:05.049 --> 00:27:05.059
demo machine for a second alright so
 

00:27:05.059 --> 00:27:09.039

Chromebook and the really exciting part
 

00:27:12.059 --> 00:27:14.479
Chromebook and the really exciting part
for us is that if I click on this button

00:27:14.479 --> 00:27:14.489
for us is that if I click on this button
 

00:27:14.489 --> 00:27:17.389
for us is that if I click on this button
down here you can see we have android

00:27:17.389 --> 00:27:17.399
down here you can see we have android
 

00:27:17.399 --> 00:27:25.460
down here you can see we have android
studio running on it yeah so we have you

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:25.470
studio running on it yeah so we have you
 

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:28.070
studio running on it yeah so we have you
know we have layout editor we have

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080
know we have layout editor we have
 

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:32.239
know we have layout editor we have
counting code building works a lot of

00:27:32.239 --> 00:27:32.249
counting code building works a lot of
 

00:27:32.249 --> 00:27:33.289
counting code building works a lot of
stuff works but there's a couple things

00:27:33.289 --> 00:27:33.299
stuff works but there's a couple things
 

00:27:33.299 --> 00:27:37.279
stuff works but there's a couple things
that don't work so there's no ADB yet so

00:27:37.279 --> 00:27:37.289
that don't work so there's no ADB yet so
 

00:27:37.289 --> 00:27:41.060
that don't work so there's no ADB yet so
you can't run deploy debug you know some

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:41.070
you can't run deploy debug you know some
 

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:43.340
you can't run deploy debug you know some
of some of you don't need to debug

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:43.350
of some of you don't need to debug
 

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:44.960
of some of you don't need to debug
you can upload straight to the Play

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:44.970
you can upload straight to the Play
 

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:48.109
you can upload straight to the Play
Store and hope for the best yeah anyway

00:27:48.109 --> 00:27:48.119
Store and hope for the best yeah anyway
 

00:27:48.119 --> 00:27:49.940
Store and hope for the best yeah anyway
so I think at this point you still need

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:49.950
so I think at this point you still need
 

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:51.049
so I think at this point you still need
to sort of tinker and be very

00:27:51.049 --> 00:27:51.059
to sort of tinker and be very
 

00:27:51.059 --> 00:27:52.310
to sort of tinker and be very
comfortable with Linux but it's a very

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320
comfortable with Linux but it's a very
 

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.499
comfortable with Linux but it's a very
exciting development I think so you know

00:27:54.499 --> 00:27:54.509
exciting development I think so you know
 

00:27:54.509 --> 00:27:56.899
exciting development I think so you know
I look forward to that getting done and

00:27:56.899 --> 00:27:56.909
I look forward to that getting done and
 

00:27:56.909 --> 00:27:58.369
I look forward to that getting done and
with that I'm going to turn it back to

00:27:58.369 --> 00:27:58.379
with that I'm going to turn it back to
 

00:27:58.379 --> 00:28:01.669
with that I'm going to turn it back to
Jamal - yeah so there's a sighting could

00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679
Jamal - yeah so there's a sighting could
 

00:28:01.679 --> 00:28:09.760
Jamal - yeah so there's a sighting could
work right exciting stuff

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:09.770
 
 

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:12.440
 
all right so so torque touched on button

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:12.450
all right so so torque touched on button
 

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:13.910
all right so so torque touched on button
all the visual changes were making to

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:13.920
all the visual changes were making to
 

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.980
all the visual changes were making to
Android studio I also spend a little bit

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:15.990
Android studio I also spend a little bit
 

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:17.720
Android studio I also spend a little bit
of time talking about some changes to

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:17.730
of time talking about some changes to
 

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:19.010
of time talking about some changes to
the build system that you might want to

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:19.020
the build system that you might want to
 

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:22.270
the build system that you might want to
be aware of inside of Android studio 3.2

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:22.280
be aware of inside of Android studio 3.2
 

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.440
be aware of inside of Android studio 3.2
now the biggest change we've made is

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:24.450
now the biggest change we've made is
 

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:26.510
now the biggest change we've made is
supporting the Android app bundle which

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:26.520
supporting the Android app bundle which
 

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.570
supporting the Android app bundle which
you heard about earlier this afternoon

00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:28.580
you heard about earlier this afternoon
 

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:30.530
you heard about earlier this afternoon
now as you saw and Torsten well you have

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:30.540
now as you saw and Torsten well you have
 

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:32.060
now as you saw and Torsten well you have
a new little drop-down menu in the ID we

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:32.070
a new little drop-down menu in the ID we
 

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:33.980
a new little drop-down menu in the ID we
can create a bundle and sign a bundle

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:33.990
can create a bundle and sign a bundle
 

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:35.420
can create a bundle and sign a bundle
now if you want a little bit more

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:35.430
now if you want a little bit more
 

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:36.800
now if you want a little bit more
control we actually added some

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:36.810
control we actually added some
 

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:37.970
control we actually added some
additional flags inside your

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:37.980
additional flags inside your
 

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:40.400
additional flags inside your
build.gradle file and so in this example

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:40.410
build.gradle file and so in this example
 

00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:42.790
build.gradle file and so in this example
you have on the screen here I have

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:42.800
you have on the screen here I have
 

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:50.140
you have on the screen here I have
slides perhaps live

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:50.150
 
 

00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:52.649
 
slides great all right so all right so

00:28:52.649 --> 00:28:52.659
slides great all right so all right so
 

00:28:52.659 --> 00:28:54.460
slides great all right so all right so
let's example here so I have a new

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:54.470
let's example here so I have a new
 

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:55.720
let's example here so I have a new
bundle section and your build.gradle

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:55.730
bundle section and your build.gradle
 

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:58.419
bundle section and your build.gradle
file and so for instance I have a split

00:28:58.419 --> 00:28:58.429
file and so for instance I have a split
 

00:28:58.429 --> 00:29:00.850
file and so for instance I have a split
on density of screen density ABI and

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:00.860
on density of screen density ABI and
 

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:02.680
on density of screen density ABI and
language so this is this a few flags

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:02.690
language so this is this a few flags
 

00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:04.450
language so this is this a few flags
that you can configure to have some

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:04.460
that you can configure to have some
 

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:05.769
that you can configure to have some
control what's actually inside your

00:29:05.769 --> 00:29:05.779
control what's actually inside your
 

00:29:05.779 --> 00:29:09.970
control what's actually inside your
bundle all right so next is Android X

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:09.980
bundle all right so next is Android X
 

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:12.310
bundle all right so next is Android X
refactoring so tour give you an example

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:12.320
refactoring so tour give you an example
 

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:14.169
refactoring so tour give you an example
how it works inside the ID and again

00:29:14.169 --> 00:29:14.179
how it works inside the ID and again
 

00:29:14.179 --> 00:29:15.250
how it works inside the ID and again
what happens from the build system

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:15.260
what happens from the build system
 

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:17.260
what happens from the build system
perspective is that we will convert your

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:17.270
perspective is that we will convert your
 

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:20.080
perspective is that we will convert your
legacy maven dependencies and convert

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:20.090
legacy maven dependencies and convert
 

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:21.880
legacy maven dependencies and convert
those to the new Android X namespace

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:21.890
those to the new Android X namespace
 

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:24.010
those to the new Android X namespace
well cache those and use those for

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:24.020
well cache those and use those for
 

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:26.680
well cache those and use those for
subsequent builds now again if you want

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:26.690
subsequent builds now again if you want
 

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:28.029
subsequent builds now again if you want
a little bit more control what happens

00:29:28.029 --> 00:29:28.039
a little bit more control what happens
 

00:29:28.039 --> 00:29:30.310
a little bit more control what happens
to your Gradle properties if a few

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.320
to your Gradle properties if a few
 

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.419
to your Gradle properties if a few
things we added to your Gradle

00:29:31.419 --> 00:29:31.429
things we added to your Gradle
 

00:29:31.429 --> 00:29:33.310
things we added to your Gradle
properties file and so in this example I

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:33.320
properties file and so in this example I
 

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:35.409
properties file and so in this example I
have the enabled and able Jedi fire set

00:29:35.409 --> 00:29:35.419
have the enabled and able Jedi fire set
 

00:29:35.419 --> 00:29:37.000
have the enabled and able Jedi fire set
the true this is actually the default

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:37.010
the true this is actually the default
 

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:39.310
the true this is actually the default
behavior again what that does is to take

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:39.320
behavior again what that does is to take
 

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.350
behavior again what that does is to take
sure legacy maven the artifacts and

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:41.360
sure legacy maven the artifacts and
 

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:42.970
sure legacy maven the artifacts and
converts those to the new Android X

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:42.980
converts those to the new Android X
 

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:45.039
converts those to the new Android X
namespace and caches those for new

00:29:45.039 --> 00:29:45.049
namespace and caches those for new
 

00:29:45.049 --> 00:29:46.870
namespace and caches those for new
builds now let's say you have a brand

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:46.880
builds now let's say you have a brand
 

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.490
builds now let's say you have a brand
new project or perhaps you say hey look

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:48.500
new project or perhaps you say hey look
 

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.169
new project or perhaps you say hey look
I have all my in dependencies already

00:29:50.169 --> 00:29:50.179
I have all my in dependencies already
 

00:29:50.179 --> 00:29:51.730
I have all my in dependencies already
converted to enter Dex I don't need to

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:51.740
converted to enter Dex I don't need to
 

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:53.560
converted to enter Dex I don't need to
step so in that case you can actually

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:53.570
step so in that case you can actually
 

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:55.389
step so in that case you can actually
change the swag to false and we can skip

00:29:55.389 --> 00:29:55.399
change the swag to false and we can skip
 

00:29:55.399 --> 00:29:57.010
change the swag to false and we can skip
this step and what that would do is

00:29:57.010 --> 00:29:57.020
this step and what that would do is
 

00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:58.240
this step and what that would do is
actually maybe to have faster build

00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:58.250
actually maybe to have faster build
 

00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:02.039
actually maybe to have faster build
speeds when working with Android X

00:30:02.039 --> 00:30:02.049
speeds when working with Android X
 

00:30:02.049 --> 00:30:06.039
speeds when working with Android X
alright lastly d8 and r8 so da is our

00:30:06.039 --> 00:30:06.049
alright lastly d8 and r8 so da is our
 

00:30:06.049 --> 00:30:08.049
alright lastly d8 and r8 so da is our
new default Dexter inside of Android

00:30:08.049 --> 00:30:08.059
new default Dexter inside of Android
 

00:30:08.059 --> 00:30:10.750
new default Dexter inside of Android
studio we actually launched da last year

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:10.760
studio we actually launched da last year
 

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:12.159
studio we actually launched da last year
in Android studio or 3po know we've been

00:30:12.159 --> 00:30:12.169
in Android studio or 3po know we've been
 

00:30:12.169 --> 00:30:13.810
in Android studio or 3po know we've been
iterating on that and now it's the

00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:13.820
iterating on that and now it's the
 

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:15.549
iterating on that and now it's the
default and it's the replacement for Dex

00:30:15.549 --> 00:30:15.559
default and it's the replacement for Dex
 

00:30:15.559 --> 00:30:18.909
default and it's the replacement for Dex
our it is new it is a new optimizer and

00:30:18.909 --> 00:30:18.919
our it is new it is a new optimizer and
 

00:30:18.919 --> 00:30:20.980
our it is new it is a new optimizer and
shrinker inside the build tools chain

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:20.990
shrinker inside the build tools chain
 

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:22.690
shrinker inside the build tools chain
and it's our long-term strategy to

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:22.700
and it's our long-term strategy to
 

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:24.639
and it's our long-term strategy to
replace ProGuard with r8

00:30:24.639 --> 00:30:24.649
replace ProGuard with r8
 

00:30:24.649 --> 00:30:30.450
replace ProGuard with r8
somebody excited for some folks

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:30.460
 
 

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:33.820
 
so again to try it out all you have to
