00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.220
The main video is talking about a genetic breeding model

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.680
of how to make machines learn.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.800
This method is simpler to explain or just show.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.060
Here is a machine learning to walk or play Mario or jump really high.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.060
A genetic code is an older code  but it still checks out

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.720
and I personally suspect in the future genetic models will have a resurgence as

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.800
compute power approaches crazy pants.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.380
However, the current hotness is deep learning and recursive neural networks and

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.460
that is where the linear algebra really increases

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.800
and explainability in a brief video really decreases.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.800
But if I had to kind of explain how they work

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.940
in a footnote, just for the record, it's like this:

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.700
No infinite warehouse. Just one student.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.580
Teacher Bot has the same test, but this time Builder Bot is 'Dial Adjustment Bot'

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.640
where each dial is how sensitive one connection in the student bot's head is.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.240
There's a lot of connections in its head so a lot of dials.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.160
A LOT, a lot.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.460
Teacher Bot shows Student Bot a photo and Dial Adjustment Bot adjusts that dial

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.080
stronger or weaker to get Student Bot closer to the answer.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.600
It's a bit like adjusting the dial on a radio. Is that still a thing? Do cars have radios still?

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.940
I don't know, anyway. You might not know the exact frequency of the station

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.300
but you can tell if your getting closer or further away.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.900
It's like that but with a hundred thousand dials and a lot of math,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.460
and that's just for one test question.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.140
When Teacher Bot introduces the next photo,

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.220
Dial Adjustment Bot needs to adjust all the dials so that Student Bot can answer both questions.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.620
As the test gets longer,

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.900
this becomes an insane amount of math and fine tuning for Dial Adjustment Bot.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.840
But when it's done there's a student bot who

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.360
can do a pretty good job at recognizing new photos,

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.340
though still suffers from some of the problems mentioned in the main video.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.840
Anyway, that the most babies' first introduction to neural networks you will ever hear.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.720
If it sounds interesting to you and you like math and code,

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.180
go dig into the details;

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.980
machines that learn are the future of everything.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.600
Maybe, quite literally, the future of everything,

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.100
and given what we've put them through, may the bots have mercy on us all.
