00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.797
The lowest common denominator for each of these fractions is k times r, or kr.

00:00:05.797 --> 00:00:10.945
Keep in mind that K is some unknown number and so is R. So the only factor that

00:00:10.945 --> 00:00:19.072
we're certain that they share is 1. So k times 1 is k and 1 x r is r. This means

00:00:19.072 --> 00:00:20.668
that the product of these factors must be the LCD.
