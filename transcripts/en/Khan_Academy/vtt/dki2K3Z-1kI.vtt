00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.162
- [Tutor] Imagine we're
asked to approximate the area

00:00:03.162 --> 00:00:06.421
between the x-axis and the graph of f

00:00:06.421 --> 00:00:09.488
from x equals one to x equals 10

00:00:09.488 --> 00:00:11.571
using a right Riemann sum

00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:16.367
with three equal subdivisions.

00:00:16.367 --> 00:00:20.686
To do that, we are given
a table of values for f,

00:00:20.686 --> 00:00:22.006
so I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:24.612
and see if you can come
up with an approximation

00:00:24.612 --> 00:00:27.028
for the area between
the x axis and the graph

00:00:27.028 --> 00:00:29.367
from x equals one to x equals 10

00:00:29.367 --> 00:00:33.676
using a right Riemann sum
with three equal subdivisions,

00:00:33.676 --> 00:00:35.132
so I'm assuming you've had a go at it,

00:00:35.132 --> 00:00:37.073
so now let's try to do that together

00:00:37.073 --> 00:00:37.906
and this is interesting,

00:00:37.906 --> 00:00:40.128
because we don't have a
graph of the entire function,

00:00:40.128 --> 00:00:42.454
but we just have the value of the function

00:00:42.454 --> 00:00:43.445
at certain points,

00:00:43.445 --> 00:00:45.298
but as we'll see, this is all we need

00:00:45.298 --> 00:00:47.208
in order to get an
approximation for the area,

00:00:47.208 --> 00:00:48.584
we don't know how close it is

00:00:48.584 --> 00:00:50.490
to the actual area with just these points,

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.208
but it'll give us at least

00:00:52.208 --> 00:00:54.833
a right Riemann sum for the approximation,

00:00:54.833 --> 00:00:57.338
or an approximation using
a right Riemann sum.

00:00:57.338 --> 00:00:59.381
So let me just draw some axes here,

00:00:59.381 --> 00:01:01.102
'cause whenever I do Riemann sums,

00:01:01.102 --> 00:01:02.963
you can do 'em without graphs,

00:01:02.963 --> 00:01:05.310
but it helps to think
about what's going on

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.287
if you can visualize it graphically,

00:01:08.287 --> 00:01:12.686
so let's see, we are going from
x equals one to x equals 10,

00:01:12.686 --> 00:01:15.436
so this is one, two, three, four,

00:01:17.247 --> 00:01:19.997
five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10

00:01:22.673 --> 00:01:26.879
and so they give us the value
of f of x when x equals one,

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:30.182
when x equals two, three, four,

00:01:30.182 --> 00:01:34.559
when x equals seven, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10

00:01:34.559 --> 00:01:38.706
and x equals 10 and they
tell us that when x is one,

00:01:38.706 --> 00:01:40.607
we're at six, then we go
to eight, to three, five,

00:01:40.607 --> 00:01:43.318
so let me mark these off, so
we're gonna go up to eight,

00:01:43.318 --> 00:01:45.901
so one, two, three, four, five,

00:01:48.464 --> 00:01:51.814
six, seven, eight and so what we know,

00:01:51.814 --> 00:01:55.193
when x is equal to one, f of one is six,

00:01:55.193 --> 00:01:58.443
so this is one, two, three, four, five,

00:01:59.554 --> 00:02:03.554
six, seven, eight, so
this point right over here

00:02:04.798 --> 00:02:08.342
is f of one, this is
the point one comma six

00:02:08.342 --> 00:02:11.685
and then we have the
point four comma eight,

00:02:11.685 --> 00:02:16.586
four comma eight, we'll
put this right about there

00:02:16.586 --> 00:02:19.939
and then we have seven
comma three is on our graph,

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:22.992
y equals x f of x, so seven comma three

00:02:22.992 --> 00:02:25.681
would put us right over there

00:02:25.681 --> 00:02:29.299
and then we have 10 comma
five, so 10 comma five,

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.052
put this right over there.

00:02:31.052 --> 00:02:32.732
That's all we know about the function,

00:02:32.732 --> 00:02:34.544
we don't know exactly what it looks like,

00:02:34.544 --> 00:02:37.377
our function might look like this,

00:02:38.877 --> 00:02:41.544
it might do something like this,

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.438
whoops, I drew a part that
didn't look like a function,

00:02:46.438 --> 00:02:48.337
it might do something like this

00:02:48.337 --> 00:02:50.754
and oscillate really quickly,

00:02:51.802 --> 00:02:54.787
it might do, it might be nice and smooth

00:02:54.787 --> 00:02:58.340
and just kind of go and do
something just like that,

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.457
kind of a connect the dots, we don't know,

00:03:01.457 --> 00:03:04.189
but we can still do the approximation

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:07.011
using a right Riemann sum
with three equal subdivisions,

00:03:07.011 --> 00:03:08.078
how do we do that?

00:03:08.078 --> 00:03:09.634
Well, we're thinking about the area

00:03:09.634 --> 00:03:11.736
from x equals one to x equals 10,

00:03:11.736 --> 00:03:13.145
so let me make those boundaries clear,

00:03:13.145 --> 00:03:17.228
so this is from x equals
one to x equals 10

00:03:18.657 --> 00:03:22.382
and what we wanna do is have
three equal subdivisions

00:03:22.382 --> 00:03:25.292
and there's three very
natural subdivisions here,

00:03:25.292 --> 00:03:29.087
if we make each of our
subdivisions three-wide,

00:03:29.087 --> 00:03:32.062
so this could be a subdivision

00:03:32.062 --> 00:03:33.798
and then this is another subdivision

00:03:33.798 --> 00:03:34.847
and when you do Riemann sums,

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:36.335
you don't have to have
three equal subdivisions,

00:03:36.335 --> 00:03:38.397
although that's what you'll often see,

00:03:38.397 --> 00:03:40.705
so we've just divided going from one to 10

00:03:40.705 --> 00:03:43.845
to three equal sections,
that are three-wide,

00:03:43.845 --> 00:03:46.950
so that's three, this is
three and this is three

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.253
and so the question is how do we define

00:03:49.253 --> 00:03:51.347
the height of these subdivisions,

00:03:51.347 --> 00:03:52.887
which are going to end up being rectangles

00:03:52.887 --> 00:03:55.400
and that's where the
right Riemann sum applies,

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.538
if we were doing a left Riemann sum,

00:03:57.538 --> 00:04:00.238
we would use the left boundary
of each of the subdivisions

00:04:00.238 --> 00:04:02.224
and the value of the function there

00:04:02.224 --> 00:04:03.632
to define the height of the rectangle,

00:04:03.632 --> 00:04:05.457
so this would be doing a left Riemann sum,

00:04:05.457 --> 00:04:07.653
but we're doing a right Riemann sum,

00:04:07.653 --> 00:04:09.997
so we use the right
boundary of each of these

00:04:09.997 --> 00:04:12.100
subdivisions to define the height,

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.387
so our right boundary
is when x equals four

00:04:14.387 --> 00:04:17.527
for this first section, what
is f of four, it's eight,

00:04:17.527 --> 00:04:20.796
so we're gonna use that as the height

00:04:20.796 --> 00:04:23.345
of our, of this first rectangle,

00:04:23.345 --> 00:04:27.043
that's approximating the area
for this part of the curve.

00:04:27.043 --> 00:04:29.020
Similarly, for this second one,

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.693
since we're using a right Riemann sum,

00:04:31.693 --> 00:04:34.472
we use the value of the
function at the right boundary,

00:04:34.472 --> 00:04:36.218
the right boundary is seven,

00:04:36.218 --> 00:04:38.256
so the value of the function is three,

00:04:38.256 --> 00:04:41.267
so this would be our second rectangle,

00:04:41.267 --> 00:04:45.197
our second division, I guess,
used to approximate the area

00:04:45.197 --> 00:04:46.224
and then last but not least,

00:04:46.224 --> 00:04:48.892
we would use the right boundary
of this third subdivision

00:04:48.892 --> 00:04:51.975
when x equals 10, f of 10 is five,

00:04:53.299 --> 00:04:54.740
so just like that

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.787
and so then our right
Riemann approximation,

00:04:57.787 --> 00:05:00.694
using our right Riemann sum
with three equal subdivisions

00:05:00.694 --> 00:05:03.424
to approximate the area, we would just add

00:05:03.424 --> 00:05:06.636
the area of these rectangles,
so this first rectangle,

00:05:06.636 --> 00:05:10.295
let's see, it is three
wide and how high is it?

00:05:10.295 --> 00:05:14.581
Well, the height here is
f of four, which is eight,

00:05:14.581 --> 00:05:17.602
so this is going to be 24 square units,

00:05:17.602 --> 00:05:19.469
whatever the units happen to be,

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:23.226
this is going to be three times
the height, here is three,

00:05:23.226 --> 00:05:26.833
f of seven is three, so
that is nine square units

00:05:26.833 --> 00:05:29.541
and then here, this is
three, the width is three

00:05:29.541 --> 00:05:32.498
times the height f of 10 is five,

00:05:32.498 --> 00:05:34.165
so three times five,

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:37.664
which gets us 15

00:05:37.664 --> 00:05:39.439
and so our approximation of the area

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:42.285
would be summing these three values up,

00:05:42.285 --> 00:05:44.990
so this would be 24 plus, let's see,

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.578
nine plus 15 would give us
another 24, so it's 24 plus 24,

00:05:49.578 --> 00:05:50.995
it gets us to 48,

00:05:51.926 --> 00:05:53.882
there you go, we just
using that table of values,

00:05:53.882 --> 00:05:56.070
we've been able to find an approximation.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.625
Now once again, we don't know
how good our approximation is,

00:05:58.625 --> 00:06:00.824
it depends on what the function is doing,

00:06:00.824 --> 00:06:03.290
there is a world where it could
be very good approximation,

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.724
maybe the function does
something like this,

00:06:06.724 --> 00:06:08.121
maybe the function just happens,

00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:09.667
let me make it a little bit,

00:06:09.667 --> 00:06:13.334
maybe the function does
something like this,

00:06:14.885 --> 00:06:16.930
where in this case, what we just did

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.486
would be a very good approximation

00:06:19.486 --> 00:06:23.393
or maybe the function
does something like this,

00:06:23.393 --> 00:06:25.920
where in this situation,

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.170
this might be a very bad approximation,

00:06:30.148 --> 00:06:32.793
but we can at least do the approximation

00:06:32.793 --> 00:06:36.793
using a right Riemann sum
just using this table.
