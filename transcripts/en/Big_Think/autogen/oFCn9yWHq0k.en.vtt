we

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:04.779
 
 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:07.900
 
so consciousnesses is one of the deepest

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:07.910
so consciousnesses is one of the deepest
 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.200
so consciousnesses is one of the deepest
questions in science and I think

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:10.210
questions in science and I think
 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.180
questions in science and I think
consciousness way may very well be the

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190
consciousness way may very well be the
 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.009
consciousness way may very well be the
deepest questions and one of the deepest

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:15.019
deepest questions and one of the deepest
 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.250
deepest questions and one of the deepest
mysteries science has ever cooked with

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260
mysteries science has ever cooked with
 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.930
mysteries science has ever cooked with
and this is one reason by the way that

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:21.940
and this is one reason by the way that
 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.970
and this is one reason by the way that
neuroscience is a very unique field in

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980
neuroscience is a very unique field in
 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.520
neuroscience is a very unique field in
all of Sciences so neuroscience is the

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:27.530
all of Sciences so neuroscience is the
 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.830
all of Sciences so neuroscience is the
only field in which the thing or the

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840
only field in which the thing or the
 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.049
only field in which the thing or the
organ being studied is also doing this

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059
organ being studied is also doing this
 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.690
organ being studied is also doing this
study now this raises a number of

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700
study now this raises a number of
 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.760
study now this raises a number of
potential concerns right this is that

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770
potential concerns right this is that
 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.850
potential concerns right this is that
even possible 10 a device or an organ or

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860
even possible 10 a device or an organ or
 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.190
even possible 10 a device or an organ or
a computational system understand itself

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200
a computational system understand itself
 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.520
a computational system understand itself
and that's what we're asking our brains

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530
and that's what we're asking our brains
 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.530
and that's what we're asking our brains
to do when we're faced with problems

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540
to do when we're faced with problems
 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.580
to do when we're faced with problems
such as the nature of consciousness and

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590
such as the nature of consciousness and
 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.310
such as the nature of consciousness and
the nature of consciousness is is

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320
the nature of consciousness is is
 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.490
the nature of consciousness is is
extremely hard to study for neuroscience

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500
extremely hard to study for neuroscience
 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.080
extremely hard to study for neuroscience
and science because it's very hard to

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090
and science because it's very hard to
 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.610
and science because it's very hard to
measure but some people have proposed or

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620
measure but some people have proposed or
 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.560
measure but some people have proposed or
believed that one of the reasons

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570
believed that one of the reasons
 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.669
believed that one of the reasons
consciousness involved is to allow us to

00:01:08.669 --> 00:01:08.679
consciousness involved is to allow us to
 

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:12.010
consciousness involved is to allow us to
simulate future scenarios and this

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020
simulate future scenarios and this
 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.749
simulate future scenarios and this
relates to something called mental time

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759
relates to something called mental time
 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.300
relates to something called mental time
travel so mental time travel is the

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310
travel so mental time travel is the
 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.529
travel so mental time travel is the
ability that we have to relive past

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539
ability that we have to relive past
 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:26.260
ability that we have to relive past
experiences so we've all spent perhaps

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270
experiences so we've all spent perhaps
 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.359
experiences so we've all spent perhaps
inordinate amounts of time daydreaming

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369
inordinate amounts of time daydreaming
 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.249
inordinate amounts of time daydreaming
about the past or reliving things that

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259
about the past or reliving things that
 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.129
about the past or reliving things that
have happened and giving those things

00:01:32.129 --> 00:01:32.139
have happened and giving those things
 

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:35.289
have happened and giving those things
alternate endings and simulating them in

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299
alternate endings and simulating them in
 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.480
alternate endings and simulating them in
the past to see how we can use them in

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490
the past to see how we can use them in
 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.819
the past to see how we can use them in
the future we also spend a lot of time

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829
the future we also spend a lot of time
 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:41.910
the future we also spend a lot of time
that day dreaming about the future and

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920
that day dreaming about the future and
 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.859
that day dreaming about the future and
importantly our ability to mentally

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869
importantly our ability to mentally
 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.569
importantly our ability to mentally
project ourselves in the future is

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579
project ourselves in the future is
 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.940
project ourselves in the future is
perhaps one of the most valuable things

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950
perhaps one of the most valuable things
 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.819
perhaps one of the most valuable things
about those most valuable cognitive

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829
about those most valuable cognitive
 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.519
about those most valuable cognitive
abilities of our species I think in many

00:01:54.519 --> 00:01:54.529
abilities of our species I think in many
 

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:57.849
abilities of our species I think in many
ways a future-oriented time travel makes

00:01:57.849 --> 00:01:57.859
ways a future-oriented time travel makes
 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:59.649
ways a future-oriented time travel makes
Homo sapiens sapiens

Homo sapiens sapiens
 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.440

it makes Homo sapiens wise because it's

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450
it makes Homo sapiens wise because it's
 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.679
it makes Homo sapiens wise because it's
what gives us the ability to engage in

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689
what gives us the ability to engage in
 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.260
what gives us the ability to engage in
endeavors that other animals cannot do

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270
endeavors that other animals cannot do
 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.020

something for something in the future so

something for something in the future so
