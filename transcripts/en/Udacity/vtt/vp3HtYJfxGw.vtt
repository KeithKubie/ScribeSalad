00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.880
Okay Michael, I didn't give you as much time as I normally

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.660
do because you think you already know the answer. So what's the answer?

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.160
&gt;&gt; So, you know, I'd rather get the

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.180
plus 2's occasionally, so I'll say the bottom one.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:09.760
&gt;&gt; No.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.600
&gt;&gt; Wait, what? You're not going to tell me the top one's better?

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.300
&gt;&gt; no, it's not.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.690
&gt;&gt; Okay then that feels like a trick question.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.340
&gt;&gt; It's not a trick question. The answer

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.130
is, neither one is better than the other.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.100
&gt;&gt; Oh, so I had to give neither?

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.840
&gt;&gt; Or both.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.320
&gt;&gt; Which is better, and I can click

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.660
on neither.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.350
&gt;&gt; Or you could click on both. Okay. So you thought

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.970
that the bottom one was better, what was your reasoning for that?

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.660
&gt;&gt; Because, sort of moment to moment, sometimes

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.305
I'm getting plus one's, and that matches what I

00:00:35.305 --> 00:00:37.420
would've gotten if I had been on the other

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.540
bank. But then sometimes I get plus two's, which

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.040
is actually better than what I would have gotten

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.470
on the other bank. And so, I'm, I'm, I

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.740
never feel any regret being on the bottom bank.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.360
I only feel regret being on the top bank.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.320
&gt;&gt; That's fine. So, what would you say

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.040
the utility of the sequence along the bottom actually is?

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.440
&gt;&gt; 1 plus 1 plus 2 plus 1 plus 1 plus 2 plus dot, dot, dot.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.580
&gt;&gt; Which is equal to?

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.760
&gt;&gt; infinity, I guess.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.709
&gt;&gt; That's right. What about the utility of the top one?

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:06.750
&gt;&gt; 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus, that's also infinity.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.130
&gt;&gt; Yep. So the utility of both of those sequences is equal

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.360
to infinity. Do you think one of them is bigger than the other?

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.340
&gt;&gt; You drew the bottom one a larg, a little bit larger.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.710
&gt;&gt; I did.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:16.480
Or longer, anyway.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.010
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.390
&gt;&gt; But, in the end, the sum of the rewards that you get are both

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.760
going to be infinity. So the truth is, neither

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.550
one of them is better than the other.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.430
&gt;&gt; I still don't think you can say that both are better.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.430
&gt;&gt; You can't get around that.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.570
&gt;&gt; But yeah, I see, I see, neither, I can see neither is better.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.110
&gt;&gt; Or that both are better. Neither is better, both is

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.300
better, whatever. The point is that, they're both equal to infinity.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.720
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.760
&gt;&gt; And the reason they're

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.520
equal to infinity is because all we're doing is accumulating

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.240
rewards. And, if we're always going to be able to get positive

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.110
rewards no matter what we do, then it doesn't matter

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.540
what we do. This is the existential dilemma of being immortal.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.390
&gt;&gt; Oh, living forever.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.480
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.250
&gt;&gt; So if you live forever then, like why should you care about anything ever?

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.000
&gt;&gt; Right I mean, everyone, every all the mortal people are going to die and

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.729
one day they'll all be, you know, an infinite

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.850
amount of time in your past. I could do

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.180
this thing here, which is pleasurable, or I could

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.280
do this thing right now, that, you know, will, is

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.980
less pleasurable, but will eventually get me to a

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.090
better place. But if I'm going to live forever, and I

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.900
can always get to a better place, than it

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.640
really doesn't matter what I do. It really doesn't matter.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.190
&gt;&gt; Mm.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.830
&gt;&gt; Because I'm just accumulating rewards,

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.670
I'm living forever, and I'm going to,

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.230
infinity is infinity and there's no really no way to compare them.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.850
Having said that, your original notion that, look, it feels like I

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.250
should never regret having taken the second path compared to the first

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.750
because I will occasionally do better. Seems like the right intuition to have.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.240
&gt;&gt; I see but it's just not built into this particular utility scheme.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.910
&gt;&gt; Right, but it turns out there's a very easy way we can build

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.720
it into this utility scheme by just making one tiny little change. Would you

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.250
like to see it?

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.710
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:58.920
&gt;&gt; Beautiful, let's see it then
