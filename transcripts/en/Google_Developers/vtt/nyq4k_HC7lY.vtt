MEGAN SMITH: SO now we're
going to start into the

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.680
lightning talks, and
I have the honor of

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.490
introducing Susan Wojcicki.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.330
Susan has been at Google since
the start-- she's actually our

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.400
first landlord, and I hope
she's going to tell you a

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.110
little bit about that.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.460
But Susan is our senior vice
president of advertising, and

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.790
she really runs all the products
that make all of the

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.420
money that allow us to do all
the amazing things that we're

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.390
able to do.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.580
She's an extraordinary
executive, an extraordinary

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.100
visionary, a strategic leader.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.110
One of my favorites-- just a
personal story-- my favorite

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.780
experiences are--

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.400
Susan is always like double
and triple booked, and she

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.370
adds a lot of value, so
we get her everywhere.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.030
And often if you're in a meeting
and there's a lot of

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.750
people debating ideas, and ideas
are flying around, but

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.380
you can't really get moving,
when Susan walks in the room,

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.970
it just changes.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.380
Within five minutes, people are
focused on a screen and

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.240
kind of narrowing in on where
we're going to go.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.820
She just knows how to lead,
she knows how to see the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.470
future, and she's an
extraordinary leader of Google

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.190
and of our industry,
and I welcome Susan

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.440
Wojcicki to the stage.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.440
SUSAN WOJCICKI: So good
evening, everyone.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.130
It's really great to see such
a wonderful turnout

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.160
for our talk here.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.110
And since this is a developer
conference, I thought I would

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.350
talk about a few key principles
that we use when

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.640
we're developing Google
products.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.520
And I've been involved for
a long time in a lot of

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.240
products, so I summarized
this down to two.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.040
But before I do that, I'm going
to talk a little bit

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.030
about my personal story.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.510
And since Megan talked about me
being a landlord, I thought

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.780
I would start there.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.290
So when people ask the question,
well how did you

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.100
decide to join Google?

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.170
I sometimes have to say, well,
my story's kind of unusual,

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.920
it's not really like everybody
else's story.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.700
Google actually--

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.650
I actually lived with
the company,

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.630
Google, for five months.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.640
And I don't think really anyone
else can say that,

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.050
except for my husband.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.389
And so what happened was I was
renting rooms in my house, and

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.260
so, again, Larry had just
gotten funded for their

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.780
company and they were looking
for space, and I was looking

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:23.820
for renters, and we agreed on an
amount, and they moved in.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.430
And at first I didn't really
think that much about it,

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.800
other than they were renters.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.020
But then people would read about
it, and then they would

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.170
ask me questions.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.050
And I would say, oh yeah, I know
them, they're actually

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.300
renting in my garage.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.640
And so I started using the
products, and you have

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.240
remember there were a lot of big
competitors out there that

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.750
were much, much bigger than this
little company of three

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.000
people, at the time.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.600
So I started using the product
and it was pretty good.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.880
And I had this realization at
one moment, because the site

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.600
actually went down.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.620
The servers were still running
at Stanford, and it was at

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.680
that moment that I couldn't
reach Google, and that's when

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.710
I really realized how important
it had become to me

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.930
in my life, and I realized the
potential for the world, and

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.300
that's when I decided I really
wanted to join Google and be a

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.200
part of that future.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.110
So that's my story, in terms
of why I joined Google.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.320
So I joined, and I was there for
one day, and Sergey comes

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:36.300
up to me and says, I have
a mission for us.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.380
It's to organize the world's
information to make it

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.770
universally accessible
and useful.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.430
What do you think?

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.000
I said, well, I was
in [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.080
So there are less than
20 of us here.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.740
And you guys all just graduated
from college.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.030
So that's a pretty ambitious
goal, right there.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.730
But that brings me to my first
point which is that do

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.680
something important, think big,
and have a big goal of

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.430
how you can change the world.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.230
And I was really pleased to see
that Larry talked about

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.450
that this morning in his
keynote, where he said that

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.089
there's so many things that
haven't been done yet, it's

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:18.959
important to focus on the great
things that haven't

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.360
happened yet.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.480
And that's really a focus
that we have in

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.840
our development process.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.530
And a lot of times, doing
big, ambitious things

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.960
sounds really hard.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.650
In fact, they sound crazy, and
they sound impossible.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.110
But when you break them down
into parts, a lot of times you

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.270
can realize they're
actually doable.

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.600
And doing really hard, crazy
things also has the advantage

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.020
that it's a lot less
competitive, because there are

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.050
fewer people who want
to do crazy things.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.515
Like you.

00:04:46.515 --> 00:04:48.350
So let me give a few stories.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.320
So let me start with
Street View.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:57.020
So we have the beautiful imagery
that comes from the

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.160
Bright Angel Trail in the Grand
Canyon that we have been

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.760
working on.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.130
In fact, here in the lobby you
can actually see the camera

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.320
that has created it, and you
can actually try on the

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.760
backpack, and walk around
and see how we did it.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.680
But when I first heard about
Street View, it was just the

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.000
idea, which is let's create a
way to take pictures of all

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.110
the streets in the
whole world.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.950
Right?

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.250
And I went, OK.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.460
And then, you think about it,
and these ideas sound crazy at

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.220
first, but then you start
thinking, how

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.310
would you do that?

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.500
And you start thinking, well,
you would have cars, and they

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.394
would have cameras, or you could
have people, and they

00:05:36.394 --> 00:05:38.020
would have cameras, and then you
start talking, well, what

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.680
kind of cameras?

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.330
And then you find people who
actually really want to do

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.060
that, and then you're on your
way to making it happen.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.820
So we just launched our 50th
country with Street View, and

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.520
five million miles of
Street View imagery.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.730
So from a very simple idea, we
have something that enables

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:59.254
people to see imagery from
all over the world.

00:05:59.254 --> 00:06:00.504
Which is amazing.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.120
So going on to the next big
idea, which we are still

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.540
working on, which are
driverless cars.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.220
Now, if you think about
driverless cars, and you hear

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.040
about this idea, it also sounds
like this giant idea,

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.890
is it really going
to get done?

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.410
Are we actually going to
be able to do this?

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.940
And if so, when?

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.630
And so, there are many,
many benefits.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.690
It's probably the most dangerous
thing we all do, but

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.870
yet we have to do it,
which is drive.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.735
And you think about the benefits
of saving lives, and

00:06:35.735 --> 00:06:39.020
emissions, and it really
could make a

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.870
difference in the world.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:43.740
So my goal is to have the
people at Google do this

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.910
before my kids start driving.

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:48.150
So I have a personal OKR here.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.510
But it's just an example of a
really big idea that doesn't

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.520
sound possible that you
can make have happen.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.090
So let me move on to the second
big principle that we

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:58.090
think about.

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.950
Now, when I'm working with teams
and they are telling me

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.300
they're going to create some new
product, or they have some

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.320
idea, and they want to staff it,
and they want to build it,

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.750
I ask them, what is
your insight?

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:16.160
Tell me something why you're
doing something new, why

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.210
you've observed something in
the world that's different,

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.330
and what's your insight that's
going to make this product be

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.570
a big success?

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.170
And I found that if they can
answer that, the product's

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:27.370
usually a success.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.090
And if they can't, then it's
often time to go back to the

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:31.420
drawing board.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:35.020
And I think about the insights
as because there's so much

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.230
technology, and the world that
we live in is changing so

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.360
much, if we go around and we
look really, really carefully

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.830
at how the world's changing,
and we see new technology,

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:47.350
sometimes we can see glimpses
of how the world will change

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:48.840
in the future.

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.580
And if we can see that glimpse,
then we can build

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.750
around it, and we can plan for
it, and we can build those

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:59.630
next generation solutions,
we can build that future.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:02.410
So I'm going to give a few
examples, actually, of

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:06.320
insights that have been really
important to me and my product

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.220
development, and that
have guided me.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.550
And again, a lot of times these
are just one sentence,

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:14.230
but they're powerful because
it's a nugget that you can use

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:15.990
to build your products.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:19.450
So I was working on
Google Video--

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:22.160
and as you can see, we have
the YouTube logo here--

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.920
and when I was working on Google
Video, we were working

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.890
with studios who had great
content, and we were working

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:33.190
to bring this online.

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:36.710
But at the same time, after we
had just gotten it online, and

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:39.580
users are starting to be able
to see it, we had this other

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.440
video that became very,
very popular.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.480
In fact, it became--

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.080
the numbers were significantly
larger than what we were

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.790
seeing from the studio in the
studio deal we had done.

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:52.830
And it made me realize
the power of

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:54.950
user-generated content.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:57.490
So do you guys want
to see that video?

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:58.060
Yes?

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.130
All right, let me show you a
few, just 15 seconds of it.

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:03.390
But it was this video that
really gave me that insight

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:04.640
and that inspiration.

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:15.610
What I love about that video is
that the roommate is doing

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:17.710
his homework in the background
the entire

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:19.580
time, and doesn't notice.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:20.500
But this was an insight.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.870
I realized, wow, this
user-generated content, it can

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:24.640
be really, really powerful.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.900
And today we all know that,
because that's what the world

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.220
has become, user-generated
content.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.060
It has its place, it's
very valuable.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.720
There's also all kinds of other
content that's produced

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.380
professionally that's really,
really important to the

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:36.970
ecosystem, too.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:41.500
But it was that video that
really gave me the confidence

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.440
in thinking that we should
acquire YouTube.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.810
And I was a big advocate
of it, and

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:47.880
Google spent $1.65 billion.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.490
So sometimes you have one little
insight, and from that

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:54.780
little insight, you make
a really big decision.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.120
So I want to talk about another
insight that's near

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.940
and dear to my heart,
which is ads.

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.690
I'm responsible for Google's
ads business.

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:09.730
Now, we created an ad system
when Google had not very many

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:11.200
people at the company--

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.160
I would say probably like 30
people at the company.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.660
And we didn't really have enough
people even to build a

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:21.470
search engine, let alone to
try to build an ad system

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:24.710
where nobody knew anything about
advertising, nothing.

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:26.880
None of us had ever
worked in it.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.060
But we had an insight, and that
insight is something that

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.910
I still use today when
I think about the ad

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:33.430
products that we build.

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:37.220
And the insight's very basic,
but it's ads are information.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.450
Now, if you think about ads
being information, and you

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:45.510
think about them just being
commercial information, then

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:48.050
the ads need to be relevant, and
the ads need to be useful,

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:49.680
the ads need to be shown
to the right person

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.580
at the right time.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.970
Just like we think about that
first search result.

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:55.390
And so that meant we had to
build our own ad system.

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:58.060
That meant that if you typed in
flowers, you had to see ads

00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:59.440
about flowers.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:03.800
That if you typed in the name
of any book, all the ads had

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:04.990
to be about the book.

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:07.890
Not just for a bookstore, but
for that actual book.

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:10.560
And so that's a principle that
we use that caused us to build

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.660
an ad system.

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:14.530
And if I think about things
today, sometimes I'll get

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:16.760
questions, like when we first
went into display, people

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.170
would ask me how do you
feel about image ads?

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:22.050
How do you feel about
video ads?

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:26.030
Do you think an image ad
could not be a good ad?

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:26.980
You think about that.

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:28.260
Well, an image is information.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.110
Are images useful to you?

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:33.110
Yes, then an image ad can be
useful provided it's served at

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:35.760
the right ad, at the right
time, to the right user.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.150
All of it, at the end of the
day, is about serving right ad

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:40.820
and making it useful.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:44.930
So that's an insight that
we've used across our ad

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:47.400
business, from beginning
till present.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.680
And just going forward, moving
really quickly to the present,

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.520
if you look at today, and you
say, well, what do you see

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:53.020
about today?

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.280
What are things that
you're focused on?

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.670
I would say, we have
to be thinking a

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:57.910
lot more about location.

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:01.420
We have all these phones, the
phones know where we are, how

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.100
do we make all the services
that we have

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.700
super relevant to us?

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:08.560
So you think about all of you
having traveled, probably come

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.550
from all different places, and
staying in hotels, and looking

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:14.290
for places to eat.

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:17.700
Now, how many of you have
actually gotten some kind of

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:21.100
offer related to where you
are right now that would

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.820
be useful to you?

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:27.540
I'm looking, but I
see a few people.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.970
They are the brave souls who--

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:31.470
or the people who have special
technology, or

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:32.710
have special insights.

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:35.280
But it's something that doesn't
really happen yet, but

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.880
there's no reason it shouldn't
and couldn't.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.210
We should all be getting useful
information based on

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:40.910
where we are right now.

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:42.800
And the reason we haven't, is
just because those systems

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.780
haven't been built out yet.

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.780
This so it's just an example
of an insight in the way we

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.450
should think about things
in the future.

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:51.330
So just to sum up, those are my
two insights, that's how we

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:52.390
think about building.

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:54.430
We think about doing things are
really important, things

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:56.230
that haven't been done yet,
things that will be used by

00:12:56.230 --> 00:13:01.040
billions of people, and to think
about insights, and what

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.100
the future will look like.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.710
Get an insight into that future,
and then build for

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:05.175
that future.

00:13:05.175 --> 00:13:08.390
And by building for it, that
will become the future.

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:10.850
So I'm very excited about the
future of technology and how

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:12.550
it's changing our world.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:15.550
I think there are so many
opportunities for us and for

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:17.880
all of you, and I'm looking
forward to that future.
