00:00:04.338 --> 00:00:05.539
Hey!

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:07.007
You're home early.

00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:08.642
They let us out of work
'cause there was a shooting.

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:10.377
Why are you
all sweaty?

00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:12.279
I was just--
I was working out.

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:14.648
Yeah, is there something
you wanna tell me?

00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:16.049
You're beautiful.

00:00:17.284 --> 00:00:18.819
Anything else,
anything...

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:20.454
on your mind?

00:00:20.554 --> 00:00:22.356
Nope, no, why?

00:00:22.456 --> 00:00:23.857
Because what are these,
Kevin?

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:25.492
( bells jingling )

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:26.827
I don't know,
what are those?

00:00:26.927 --> 00:00:28.195
They look
like clown panties.

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:29.663
Why are there
clown panties

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:31.865
crumpled up in
our hallway?

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:33.534
Are those not yours?

00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:34.601
No, they're not mind.

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:36.203
Do they look like
the hypoallergenic brand

00:00:36.303 --> 00:00:37.237
my doctor recommended?

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:38.372
No!

00:00:38.472 --> 00:00:40.440
They look like they
belong to a clown.

00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:42.943
A slut, whore clown!
( bells jingling )

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:44.978
Okay, you know, I--
I think I know what that is.

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:47.080
I did our laundry at
that new Laundromat

00:00:47.214 --> 00:00:48.615
up the street,
Big Top Laundry.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:51.652
A lot of local clowns
go there, so...

00:00:51.752 --> 00:00:53.587
Hey, I'm glad
I worked this out, huh?
No.

00:00:53.687 --> 00:00:55.656
Uh, who's Sparkles?

00:00:55.756 --> 00:00:57.591
Hmm?
Sparkles?

00:00:57.691 --> 00:00:59.893
I went through your
phone last night.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.595
Here,
let's take a look.

00:01:02.563 --> 00:01:03.697
"You up?"

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:04.765
"I need you."

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:05.766
"Honk-honk."

00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:06.767
That's the type
of shit

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:08.135
you text to a clown!
Oh!

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:09.303
You are fucking!

00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:12.573
Oh, my God, I was just
texting a friend from work!

00:01:12.673 --> 00:01:14.274
I can't believe you
took my phone!

00:01:14.408 --> 00:01:15.876
You work with someone
at Deloitte &amp; Touche

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:17.211
named Sparkles?

00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:20.214
Yes, Sparkles Biederman!

00:01:20.314 --> 00:01:22.115
He's been there
for years.

00:01:22.216 --> 00:01:23.350
He's Dutch.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.886
"Your ass is tighter
than a balloon giraffe."

00:01:25.986 --> 00:01:27.788
You text that to a man
you work with

00:01:27.888 --> 00:01:29.890
at a financial
consulting firm?

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.158
It's industry jargon.

00:01:31.258 --> 00:01:33.126
It's not in your
wheelhouse.

00:01:33.227 --> 00:01:34.428
You know what,
this is stupid.

00:01:34.528 --> 00:01:35.829
Let's just look at
the security footage

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:36.830
from last night.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.332
How about that?
Oh, my God!

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:40.400
You are being
so crazy right now!

00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:44.004
( laughing )

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:51.879
What the fuck
is that, Kevin?

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:53.347
( bells jingling )

00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:00.521
( laughing )

00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:01.688
Okay.

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.057
You got me.

00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:07.528
It was supposed
to be

00:02:07.628 --> 00:02:10.564
a surprise for
our anniversary.

00:02:10.697 --> 00:02:13.066
Our anniversary?

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:14.568
It's tomorrow.

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:18.906
You forgot,
didn't you?

00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:21.175
Oh, my God.

00:02:21.275 --> 00:02:24.178
I totally forgot.

00:02:24.278 --> 00:02:26.880
I'm such a stupid
dumb bitch.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.316
I know how you like
balloon animals

00:02:29.416 --> 00:02:31.752
so I paid
these clowns to...

00:02:31.852 --> 00:02:33.320
fill your closet up
with them.

00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:39.092
( sighing )

00:02:41.528 --> 00:02:43.163
Surprise.

00:02:43.297 --> 00:02:44.531
I'm so sorry.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.001
Why do you
put up with me?

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:53.207
Because you're hot.

00:02:53.307 --> 00:02:55.342
( whispering )
Thank God.

00:02:55.442 --> 00:02:57.411
I'm so sorry.

00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:03.283
I just-- I get
so scared of losing you.

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:05.485
I know, I know,
I know, I know.
( bells jingling )

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:07.321
I know, I know.
