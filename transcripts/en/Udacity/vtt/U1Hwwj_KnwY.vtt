00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.585
So there are lots of good reason to use race. For this quiz, we're going to use

00:00:03.585 --> 00:00:07.486
it purely for fun, purely to obfuscate our code. And the question is which of

00:00:07.486 --> 00:00:10.936
these code fragments print out raise a ruckus? Check all the ones that do. Of

00:00:10.936 --> 00:00:14.590
course you could solve this by just running the code in Python, but I want you

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.086
to try to figure it out without doing that. If you can solve this without

00:00:18.086 --> 00:00:20.823
running the code, then you definitely deserve a raise.
