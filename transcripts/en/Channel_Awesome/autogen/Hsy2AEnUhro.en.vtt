one where um Aang tells his backstory
about when he was with the monks why he

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790
about when he was with the monks why he
 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.149

to UM against or the dilemma of whether

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569
to UM against or the dilemma of whether
 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.900
to UM against or the dilemma of whether
or not this kid should have been told

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910
or not this kid should have been told
 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.200
or not this kid should have been told
and now why he

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210
and now why he
 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.240
and now why he
was told I think that's important to is

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250
was told I think that's important to is
 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.700
was told I think that's important to is
that they know something big is coming

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710
that they know something big is coming
 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.370
that they know something big is coming
and they know this will they know this

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380
and they know this will they know this
 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.470
and they know this will they know this
will probably damage him and this is not

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480
will probably damage him and this is not
 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.590
will probably damage him and this is not
the best thing for him as a person being

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600
the best thing for him as a person being
 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.120
the best thing for him as a person being
told that he's the avatar he's gonna

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130
told that he's the avatar he's gonna
 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.310
told that he's the avatar he's gonna
have this great big weight set up Atum

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320
have this great big weight set up Atum
 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.730
have this great big weight set up Atum
and all this responsibility but much

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740
and all this responsibility but much
 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.130
and all this responsibility but much
greater things are at risk all that many

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140
greater things are at risk all that many
 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.620
greater things are at risk all that many
other people's lives are at risk of

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630
other people's lives are at risk of
 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.110
other people's lives are at risk of
course the big dilemma is that is that

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120
course the big dilemma is that is that
 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.510
course the big dilemma is that is that
worth it is that you know it justified

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520
worth it is that you know it justified
 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.220
worth it is that you know it justified
and that's it's a good question um and

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230
and that's it's a good question um and
 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.540
and that's it's a good question um and
so these two sides of the monks are

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550
so these two sides of the monks are
 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.000
so these two sides of the monks are
differing on it one you know wants to

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010
differing on it one you know wants to
 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.220
differing on it one you know wants to
teach him but still wants him to be a

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230
teach him but still wants him to be a
 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.110
teach him but still wants him to be a
child he he wants it to be mentally

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120
child he he wants it to be mentally
 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.350
child he he wants it to be mentally
stable and mentally sound and balanced

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360
stable and mentally sound and balanced
 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.020
stable and mentally sound and balanced

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880
world and you're gonna turn into a
 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.400
world and you're gonna turn into a
madman possibly um and the other is

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410
madman possibly um and the other is
 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.380
madman possibly um and the other is
saying no we don't have time for this

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390
saying no we don't have time for this
 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.540
