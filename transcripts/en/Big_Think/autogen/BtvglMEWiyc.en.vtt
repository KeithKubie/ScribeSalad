it really is it's it comes back to
 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.150
it really is it's it comes back to
experimentation and I think it's really

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160
experimentation and I think it's really
 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.850
experimentation and I think it's really
hard thing to do and it's a scary thing

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:15.860
hard thing to do and it's a scary thing
 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.109
hard thing to do and it's a scary thing
to do because you've got in some cases

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119
to do because you've got in some cases
 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.470
to do because you've got in some cases

Zucker talked about trading into analog
 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.880
Zucker talked about trading into analog
dollars for digital pennies and I think

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890
dollars for digital pennies and I think
 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.010
dollars for digital pennies and I think
he recently updated to say digital dimes

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020
he recently updated to say digital dimes
 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.050
he recently updated to say digital dimes
and so it's very scary to sort of make

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060
and so it's very scary to sort of make
 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.120
and so it's very scary to sort of make
that transition to say well I'm putting

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130
that transition to say well I'm putting
 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.960
that transition to say well I'm putting
this huge enterprise at risk for an

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970
this huge enterprise at risk for an
 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.790
this huge enterprise at risk for an
uncertain future but I think that that

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800
uncertain future but I think that that
 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.619
uncertain future but I think that that
so many of those forces that are taking

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629
so many of those forces that are taking
 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:40.299
so many of those forces that are taking
place are going to take place you know

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309
place are going to take place you know
 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:41.979
place are going to take place you know
whether or not you want them to or not I

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989
whether or not you want them to or not I

mean the train has left the station in a

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140
mean the train has left the station in a
 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.440
mean the train has left the station in a
number of different instances and so to

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450
number of different instances and so to
 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.000
number of different instances and so to
sort of sit back and say well I want to

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010
sort of sit back and say well I want to
 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.319
sort of sit back and say well I want to
roll back the clock five or ten years

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329
roll back the clock five or ten years
 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.620
roll back the clock five or ten years
ago I get why that that's that would be

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:53.630
ago I get why that that's that would be
 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.530
ago I get why that that's that would be
you know people want to do that but i

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540
you know people want to do that but i
 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.120
you know people want to do that but i
think it's just it's it's hard if not

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.130
think it's just it's it's hard if not
 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.530
think it's just it's it's hard if not
impossible to do and I think that's not

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540
impossible to do and I think that's not
 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.569
impossible to do and I think that's not
where your your your users or your

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579
where your your your users or your
 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.130
where your your your users or your
readers are going to go and so it's

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140
readers are going to go and so it's
 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.329
readers are going to go and so it's
really important to try and find

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339
really important to try and find
 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.070
really important to try and find
different ways to try and push the

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080
different ways to try and push the
 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.719
different ways to try and push the
envelope and test those things which I

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729
envelope and test those things which I
 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.260

again I acknowledge a hundred percent

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270
again I acknowledge a hundred percent
 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.390
again I acknowledge a hundred percent
that's that's that's tricky and that's

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400
that's that's that's tricky and that's
 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.130
that's that's that's tricky and that's
scared to do but I think it's if you

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140
scared to do but I think it's if you
 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.039
scared to do but I think it's if you
don't you're sort of you've got bigger

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049
don't you're sort of you've got bigger
 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:23.120
don't you're sort of you've got bigger
challenges down the road

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130
 
 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.190
 
well I think the path you know 20 years

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200
well I think the path you know 20 years
 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.899
well I think the path you know 20 years
ago is sort of the same you start off

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909
ago is sort of the same you start off
 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.090
ago is sort of the same you start off
that it may be a small regional paper

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100
that it may be a small regional paper
 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.590
that it may be a small regional paper
and to work your way up and then you get

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600
and to work your way up and then you get
 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.230
and to work your way up and then you get
to the times of the journal and I think

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240
to the times of the journal and I think
 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.730
to the times of the journal and I think
in you know we're talking a little bit

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740
in you know we're talking a little bit
 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.240
in you know we're talking a little bit
about how users and other readers and

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250
about how users and other readers and
 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.120
about how users and other readers and
their experience with with information

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130
their experience with with information
 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.889
their experience with with information
is now much more active before is very

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899
is now much more active before is very
 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.090
is now much more active before is very
sort of passive they'd sort of sit back

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100
sort of passive they'd sort of sit back
 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.130
sort of passive they'd sort of sit back
and the information we presented to them

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140
and the information we presented to them
 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.809
and the information we presented to them
now it's much more of a dialogue and I

00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:47.819
now it's much more of a dialogue and I
 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:49.609
now it's much more of a dialogue and I
think there's there's there's a bit of

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619
think there's there's there's a bit of
 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.260
think there's there's there's a bit of
an analogy as well with with the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270
an analogy as well with with the
 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.510
an analogy as well with with the
journalist today and that it's not just

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520
journalist today and that it's not just
 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.039
journalist today and that it's not just
sort of this passive thing where I write

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049
sort of this passive thing where I write
 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.210
sort of this passive thing where I write
my content and I put it out there

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220
my content and I put it out there
 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.279
my content and I put it out there
somebody puts that content a thurs and

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289
somebody puts that content a thurs and
 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:59.749
somebody puts that content a thurs and
is responsible for the distribution of

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759
is responsible for the distribution of
 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.789
is responsible for the distribution of
my content and I sort of sit back and I

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799
my content and I sort of sit back and I
 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.830
my content and I sort of sit back and I
continue to write that content to write

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840
continue to write that content to write
 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.660
continue to write that content to write
those stories I think it's it's much

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670
those stories I think it's it's much
 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.020
those stories I think it's it's much
more of an active role to own your you

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030
more of an active role to own your you
 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.580
more of an active role to own your you
know your brand and your experience in

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590
know your brand and your experience in
 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.140
know your brand and your experience in
your information how that gets out there

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150
your information how that gets out there
 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.820
your information how that gets out there
and understanding the technology at your

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830
and understanding the technology at your
 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.640
and understanding the technology at your
disposal so you can get that out there

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650
disposal so you can get that out there
 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.780
disposal so you can get that out there
understanding how you can tell stories

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790
understanding how you can tell stories
 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.870
understanding how you can tell stories
in better ways I think a lot of the you

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880
in better ways I think a lot of the you
 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.120
in better ways I think a lot of the you
know we couple times we've gone over to

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130
know we couple times we've gone over to
 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.370
know we couple times we've gone over to
to CUNY which with their new journalism

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380
to CUNY which with their new journalism
 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.600
to CUNY which with their new journalism
school and I think that's an interesting

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610
school and I think that's an interesting
 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.069
school and I think that's an interesting
idea it's a new school so I think that

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:28.079
idea it's a new school so I think that
 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:29.270
idea it's a new school so I think that
the way that they're thinking about it

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280
the way that they're thinking about it
 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.370
the way that they're thinking about it
and really I think one of the phrases

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380
and really I think one of the phrases
 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.870
and really I think one of the phrases
they use an entrepreneurial journalism

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880
they use an entrepreneurial journalism
 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.180
they use an entrepreneurial journalism
and i think that's that's that's that's

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190
and i think that's that's that's that's
 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.280
and i think that's that's that's that's
true whether you've been in the business

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290
true whether you've been in the business
 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.539
true whether you've been in the business
for a number different years or whether

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549
for a number different years or whether
 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.670
for a number different years or whether
you're just starting off it's this this

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680
you're just starting off it's this this
 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.920
you're just starting off it's this this
you're thinking about the content and

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930
you're thinking about the content and
 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.199
you're thinking about the content and
the distribution of it and then and the

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209
the distribution of it and then and the
 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.610
the distribution of it and then and the
monetization of it I mean all these

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620
monetization of it I mean all these
 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.789
monetization of it I mean all these
things kind of matter so much more that

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799
things kind of matter so much more that
 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.319
things kind of matter so much more that
simply just putting a piece of

simply just putting a piece of

simply just putting a piece of
information out there is probably not

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910
information out there is probably not
 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.940
information out there is probably not
going to be enough and so to really try

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950
going to be enough and so to really try
 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.979
going to be enough and so to really try
and immerse yourselves in all those

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989
and immerse yourselves in all those
 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.710
and immerse yourselves in all those
different ways whether it's you know I

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720
different ways whether it's you know I

think there's always been the church and
 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.160
think there's always been the church and
state and I think there's that

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170
state and I think there's that

lot of good reasons about not making

lot of good reasons about not making
sure that your the information that

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600
sure that your the information that
