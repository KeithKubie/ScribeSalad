00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.860
One of the most pervasive stereotypes about black Americans is that of the absent black father.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.520
The absent black father myth is the idea

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.060
– the stereotypical and incorrect notion – that African-American fathers have

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.260
very little contact with their children, if any contact at all.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.220
And in black America, the reality of being fatherless is perhaps most painful.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.040
73% of all black babies are born out of wedlock.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.980
Experts say there's a crisis when it comes to black fathers in this country.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.640
The news media loves asking where all the black fathers are – and that whole idea has been linked to everything

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.400
from poverty and crime to even police violence against black communities.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.579
Why are these police shootings occurring? Well, it's because there is an absent

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.980
black father, or it’s because black families are on welfare.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.260
But this idea that black fathers aren’t present in their kids’ lives is actually false.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.880
To be a parent is to have children that you love and try and support, and black fathers

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.780
experience that the same way anyone else would. Why would you even think there was a difference?

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.460
Hey guys, I’m Sana, and this Sunday on AJ+

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.360
we’re going to talk about the myth of the absent black father here in the United States,

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.180
where it comes from and how that stereotype tells a much bigger story

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.740
about the black family and black communities in this country.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.460
Just because the trope of the absent black father is so pervasive, doesn’t

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.520
doesn’t mean it’s true. Now, yes, according to a Centers for Disease Control report,

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.800
in 2013 72% of non-Hispanic black women who gave birth were unmarried.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.320
But being an unmarried mother doesn’t automatically mean that the father isn’t involved.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.320
And in fact, that’s exactly what that CDC report found.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.080
When compared to white or Hispanic fathers, black fathers were actually more likely to be involved

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.170
in their children’s lives in almost every way. They were even more likely to

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.640
have bathed, diapered or dressed their kids, eaten a meal with them, played with them,

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.040
helped them with homework and taken them to and from activities. And a lot of that

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.360
held true even when black fathers didn’t live with their children.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.460
But if we go solely off of what we see in the news media…

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.100
Where's your dad?

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.340
Don’t really know.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.580
Tell me about that.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.960
He’s just not around.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.880
… you wouldn’t really see black fathers in that way.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.540
Communications Professor Travis Dixon studies the prevalence of stereotypes in mass media

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.480
and the impact of these stereotypes on audiences. He wrote this report,

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.660
“A Dangerous Distortion of Our Families,” and in it he found that almost all news and

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.560
opinion media implicitly or explicitly encourages pretty egregious assumptions about black fathers.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.450
Black fathers were shown spending time with their kids only

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.040
half as often as white fathers – contrary to, well, the actual facts.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.680
We found that black mothers, white mothers, white fathers interacted with their kids about

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.139
26% of the time in these videos and photos that occurred in the news media.

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:06.430
Half as often, we found that happening for black fathers. Only about 14% of the

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.320
time were black fathers actually interacting with their kids on camera in photos.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.200
Dixon also found that news commentary singled out black fathers 60%

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.460
of the time, compared to white fathers only 20% of the time.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.660
What has it been like since your dad's been in jail? Can a father's love break through prison walls?

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.220
That media distortion is substantial. We know for a fact that African-American

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.800
fathers are just as likely to participate in the lives of their children than fathers of other races.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.740
And this isn’t, by the way, a politically partisan issue.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.980
Both conservative news outlets like Fox News and more centrist

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.000
ones like CNN were top distorters. Specifically Hannity, The Kelly File and CNN Tonight.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.920
Did both of you have fathers present in your lives, growing up?

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.620
So where does this toxic idea about black fathers even come from?

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.640
Well, one theory takes it back to a 1965 report titled “The Negro Family: The Case for National Action.”

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.440
The report became one of the most contentious political documents in 20th century America.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.620
Democrat and Assistant Secretary of Labor Daniel Patrick Moynihan put the report together

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.260
to make the argument for how the Lyndon B. Johnson administration had to do more for racial equality

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.240
than simply pass the Voting Rights Act. Moynihan argued that to really fight

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.080
racial inequality, the government had to understand the state of black communities

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:27.560
and why they were the way they were. But Moynihan ended up focusing on one thing: the black family.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.260
According to him, the fundamental reason for growing economic inequality between white and black

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:37.500
Americans was a “crumbling family structure” in black communities. And at the foundation of the

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.640
so-called “crumbling black family structure” was the absent black father.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.520
Moynihan looked at nonmarital birth rates and rates of fathers living

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.669
separately from their children, and made a whole bunch of assumptions about

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.810
parents’ relationship statuses and parental involvement. The report didn’t

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.160
take into account factors like the legacy of slavery, generational wealth or even economic migration,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.500
in which men left their homes so that they could provide for their families.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.060
We spoke to Carvell Wallace, a writer and a podcaster,

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.980
about the way black families have been discussed in the mainstream.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:14.620
Reading some of the literature of that time, I was like shocked at how overtly racist liberal literature was,

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.940
in terms of trying to diagnose the ills of the black community and trying to explain

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.460
why these uprisings were happening.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.140
And everyone was blaming it on the fathers and drugs and families and welfare

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:31.160
and mothers and everything. It was a lot more convenient for the story

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.840
to be told that black people weren't holding up their end of the bargain,

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.540
rather than acknowledging that America wasn't holding up its end of the bargain.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.300
The Moynihan report ultimately created three camps: the liberal camp, which saw

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.349
the report as a foundation for policy change; the conservative camp, which saw

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:49.860
the report as a justification for the argument that black communities were

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.249
responsible for their own issues; and then the left-wing camp that saw the

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:57.880
report as blaming the victim, ignoring structural racism and reinforcing racism.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.240
So what happens when people are exposed to these stereotypes about black families?

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.920
Aside from the reinforcement of the idea that black communities have no one to blame but themselves,

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.039
there’s the everyday, real-life impact these stereotypes have through policies

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.240
and support for those policies. First, there’s an almost total, willful

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.980
ignorance about the impact of slavery and modern-day incarceration on black American families.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.860
Foundationally, slavery ripped apart black families, and mass incarceration

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.900
has put 1 in 12 black men between the ages of 25 and 54 in prison

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.979
– versus 1 in 60 for non-black groups. Then there’s how these

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:37.200
characterizations of black American families have an impact on policies that affect all Americans.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.719
Take poverty for instance. During the Great Depression era,

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:44.189
the face of poverty was a white man who was down on his luck, or a white family

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:48.260
fallen victim to circumstances outside their control. And the country felt

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.620
a duty to end poverty, namely with President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.579
Then, decades later, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. began to shed light on the

00:06:56.579 --> 00:07:00.689
reality of poor black American families living in cities, and the reporters who

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:03.020
followed him began to report on these issues.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:12.380
We are tired of living in run-down, dilapidated, rat-infested shacks and slums.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.680
And as a result of that, over time, all of the imagery began to focus on these

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.090
black families, and it began to actually have a pernicious impact. It began to

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:27.440
have us think of poverty and black families as tied to this issue of black

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.620
laziness. And that's where we largely find ourselves today.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:35.020
According to Pew, more than half of Republicans believe that a lack of effort is to blame

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:38.900
for poverty, instead of circumstances beyond one’s control. As the conversation on

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.980
poverty and race shifted, so did the support for welfare.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.940
People began to think that we needed to curb welfare benefits, increase work requirements,

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:51.960
because the real problem is that black people are on welfare and they just want to be lazy.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.640
When we think about policy, what's good for families,

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.600
we tend to think about them in these racialized terms, and when we do that, we tend to have a distorted view of what needs to happen.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.120
we tend to have a distorted view of what needs to happen.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.980
So what’s the solution? Well, here’s what Dixon and Wallace had to say.

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:14.460
The main way that the media perpetuates stereotypes and racist tropes is accidentally.

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:18.460
I think the people who are in the decision-making rooms and the content-making rooms are

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:21.460
carrying these biases with them, without knowing they're carrying these biases with them,

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.400
because there's no one around to challenge them.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:27.680
So I think that, ultimately, greater diversity at all levels of decision-making in the media

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.620
and content-making process is probably our best chance at dealing with this.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:36.040
As an African-American father myself, as a father of twin sons, I take pride in

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:41.000
that role and I know many many other
black fathers who take pride in being

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.060
involved with their kids, regardless of the marital situation with the mother.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:50.120
So I really would like the media to show some of those stories as well.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:54.840
Ultimately, I'm raising my kids to be a part of the solution, rather than a part of the

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.060
problem. You know, that's really all I can do.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.640
So we focused on the way the news

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:05.180
media talks about black families and black fathers, but there’s no shortage of

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:10.010
the same representation in entertainment. Take, for example, one of our favorite

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:13.600
scenes of all time from the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. You know exactly which one

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.000
I’m talking about. So let us know in the comments below what you guys think, where

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.870
else you’ve encountered this trope – and tune in next week when we come at you

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:23.740
with another great video.
