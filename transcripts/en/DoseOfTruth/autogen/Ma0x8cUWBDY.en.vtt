estimates right based on on the biblical
 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.460
estimates right based on on the biblical
and I mean that's not a fluke obviously

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470
and I mean that's not a fluke obviously
 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.150
and I mean that's not a fluke obviously
but it's it's interesting to see the

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160
but it's it's interesting to see the
 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.889
but it's it's interesting to see the
concordance between these ancient

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899
concordance between these ancient
 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.220
concordance between these ancient
stories and the present-day world so I

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230
stories and the present-day world so I
 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.350
stories and the present-day world so I
thought that was very interesting and it

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360
thought that was very interesting and it
 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.840
thought that was very interesting and it
shows once again that the past you think

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.910
shows once again that the past you think
the past is the past but it's not it's

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920
the past is the past but it's not it's

and somehow in some ways is folded up
inside the present waiting to unfold the

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649
inside the present waiting to unfold the
 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.650
inside the present waiting to unfold the
past is all folded up inside the present

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660
