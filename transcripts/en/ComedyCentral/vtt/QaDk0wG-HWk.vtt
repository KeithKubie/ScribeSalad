00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:32.432
IS ONE OF THE BEST TIMES
I'VE HAD IN A LONG TIME.

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.034
- [laughing]

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:36.737

QUAKERS IN PRISON.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.906
THEY WERE LIKE,
THANK YOU, MARY, FOR COMING,

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:41.775
'CAUSE WE GET THAT YOU GET
WHAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH.

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:43.410
SHE'S LIKE, TOTALLY.

00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:45.479
SO THE COMMONWEALTH
OF MASSACHUSETTS

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:47.447
WAS LIKE,
STOP VISITING PRISONERS.

00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:50.050
STOP ACTING LIKE
IT'S OKAY.

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:53.387
WE GOTTA [bleep] KILL YOU.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.255
SO HE WALKED HER
TO THE GALLOWS

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.992
ON BOSTON COMMON
IN 1660.

00:00:59.026 --> 00:01:04.331
AND THEY PUT THE NOOSE
AROUND HER NECK.

00:01:04.364 --> 00:01:05.966
SO SHE HAD THE ROPE
AROUND HER NECK,

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.568
LIKE, ABOUT TO DIE.

00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:10.938
SHE SAID,
NO EAR CAN HEAR,

00:01:10.971 --> 00:01:13.073
NO TONGUE CAN TASTE,

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:15.509
NO HEART CAN UNDERSTAND...

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:18.078
THE JOY--

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:20.681
SOMETHING LIKE, THE JOY--

00:01:20.714 --> 00:01:23.250
[bleep].
I DON'T [bleep] KNOW.

00:01:23.283 --> 00:01:26.253
THE JOY AND THE TREASURES
OF THE BLESSINGS

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:28.422
AND THE REFRESHMENTS.

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:30.157
I DON'T GET WHAT THAT IS.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.759

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:43.537
EVERYONE'S WATCHING.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.939
OH, MY GOD.
WE'RE ON THE BOSTON COMMON.

00:01:45.973 --> 00:01:48.141
WE'RE ON--
WATCHING SOMEONE DIE.

00:01:48.175 --> 00:01:52.012
THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM
FOR BEING A SICK [bleep].

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:53.680
AND THEN KING CHARLES
WAS LIKE,

00:01:53.714 --> 00:01:55.516

00:01:57.217 --> 00:01:59.786
I DIDN'T SAY THIS [bleep]
SHOULD GET SO CRAZY.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.688
DON'T KILL PEOPLE.

00:02:01.722 --> 00:02:03.357
THAT MAKES YOU LOOK MORE
LIKE A PUSSY,

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.659
IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW,
BY THE WAY, DUDES.

00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:08.629
BUT SHE CHANGED THE WORLD.

00:02:08.662 --> 00:02:11.698
BUT YOU'LL NEVER HEAR ABOUT IT
ANYWHERE BUT HERE.

00:02:11.732 --> 00:02:13.400
- WELL, NOW--

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:14.401

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.138
AND YOU KNOW WHOSE GRAVE
IS MARKED?

00:02:18.172 --> 00:02:20.207

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.876
