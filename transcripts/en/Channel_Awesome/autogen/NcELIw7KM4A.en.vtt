that is working way too hard to do the
 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.920 align:start position:0%
that is working way too hard to do the
simplest<00:01:10.590><c> things</c><00:01:10.890><c> like</c><00:01:11.130><c> to</c><00:01:12.119><c> activate</c><00:01:12.689><c> the</c><00:01:12.810><c> end</c>

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.230 align:start position:0%
simplest things like to activate the end
to<00:01:13.020><c> like</c><00:01:13.280><c> take</c><00:01:14.280><c> this</c><00:01:14.400><c> thing</c><00:01:14.580><c> down</c><00:01:14.729><c> do</c><00:01:14.939><c> this</c><00:01:15.119><c> and</c>

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
to like take this thing down do this and
 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.640 align:start position:0%
to like take this thing down do this and
then<00:01:15.330><c> becomes</c><00:01:15.659><c> like</c><00:01:15.810><c> this</c><00:01:15.930><c> drop</c><00:01:16.350><c> and</c><00:01:16.560><c> then</c>

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 align:start position:0%
then becomes like this drop and then
 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.460 align:start position:0%
then becomes like this drop and then
turns<00:01:16.890><c> into</c><00:01:17.040><c> a</c><00:01:17.159><c> marble</c><00:01:17.430><c> thing</c><00:01:18.080><c> it's</c><00:01:19.080><c> a</c><00:01:19.200><c> button</c>
