ANDREW BROGDON: A mediated
ad unit can request ads

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.820
from not just AdMob but
a list of ad networks,

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.910
and it used to be that each
ad unit had its own list.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.060
That meant that if you had 100
ad units across a dozen apps,

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.310
you also had 100
mediation stacks, which

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.990
is difficult to maintain.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.670
But with the rollout
of the new AdMob

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.340
interface comes
Mediation Groups.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.930
Instead of configuring a
similar list over and over

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.650
for a bunch of ad units,
you can do it just once

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.170
and have multiple ad
units reference it.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.660
In addition, there's now
support for multiple line

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.590
items for a single network.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.310
So if you're mediating a network
that supports price floors,

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.400
you can target them several
times with different values

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.800
and have a chance to get
the most valuable ad.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.030
So that's Mediation Groups.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.490
And if you've updated to the
new AdMob user interface,

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.420
you can start using
them right now.
