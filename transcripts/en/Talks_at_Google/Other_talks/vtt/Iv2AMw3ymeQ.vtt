[applause]

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.340
&gt;&gt;Lee: Today we have two members from the
Sea Shepherd Conservation Society; marine

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.020
wildlife conservation organization featured
on the TV series, Whale Wars. Tod Emko, is

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.020
that right?

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.020
&gt;&gt;Todd: Yes.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.020
&gt;&gt;Lee: Is a New York based computer programmer--

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.020
[pause]

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.190
[laughter and applause]

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.900
who has traveled with the Sea Shepherd as
a, to the Antarctic to defend the whales as

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.689
a communications officer. Andrea Gordon is
a lawyer and a former Public Defender, who

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:34.830
first joined Sea Shepherd in 2005, to protect
the baby harp seals in Canada and the deep

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:40.430
sea from bottom trawling. She crewed on Sea
Shepherd's most recent Antarctic defense campaign

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.680
this past winter. And they spent time at Sea
Shepherd's Galapagos field office protecting

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.850
the Marine Reserve and World Heritage Site.
And outside of Sea Shepherd, they're starting

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.460
the Darwin Animal Doctors, a comprehensive
veterinary clinic in the Galapagos Islands.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.739
So, please join me in welcoming SS Crew members,
Tod Emko and Andrea Gordon.

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.039
[applause]

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.640
[Andrea laughs]

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.120
Take it away, guys.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.980
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Thanks so much, Lee, and thanks
so much for having us here today at Google.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.330
It's just really such an honor to be here
and Googling is something I certainly do every

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.070
day. So, thanks so much for having us here.
I'm Andrea Gordon.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.310
&gt;&gt;Tod: I'm Tod Emko.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.580
&gt;&gt;Andrea: And has anybody here seen Whale
Wars, the TV show? OK. Great, we have a few

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.180
Whale Wars fans, but for any of you who haven't
heard of Whale Wars or seen it, it's our hit

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:35.490
TV show on Animal Planet. It's a reality show
that takes you with us to the front lines

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.750
of our battle to save whales in the Antarctic
Whale Sanctuary from a criminal whaling operation.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.350
But what we wanted to talk to you today about
is not just what you're gonna see on the TV

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.610
show, but it's really about individual actions
and how it's up to every single one of us

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.200
to really do our part to help save the oceans.
And what we've seen, being out at sea, about

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:09.180
the impacts of consumers like us, on the oceans.
And so, Tod and I, we personally came up with

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.870
three easy things that people can do in less
than five minutes a day to help save the oceans.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.959
And those things are to grab a bag, which
is to use reusable shopping bags, water bottles;

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.709
that kind of thing and we actually already
saw that Google has taken a step with that

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.170
and doesn't have bottled water available for
employees. So, I definitely commend Google

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.019
on that. And the second thing that we came
up with is to forgo the fish, which is to

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:34.280
stop eating fish and other marine life. And
the third thing that we came up with is for

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:49.819
people to do number one and two, so that's
to grab a bag and to forgo the fish and talk

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.079
about these issues in conservation.

00:02:53.079 --> 00:03:07.420
&gt;&gt;Tod: Yeah. We actually didn't come up with
these three things lightly. We thought a lot

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:26.260
about what we wanted to talk about today.
At first we thought like, the easiest thing

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:39.620
would obviously be just to talk about like,
our adventures with Sea Shepherd and dressing

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:48.969
up in black and sneaking through the bush
chasing poachers and stuff. Or fighting the

00:03:48.969 --> 00:04:01.550
Antarctic and getting grenades chucked at
us and stuff and that would be cool, I guess.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:09.431
But we wanted to add like a lot more value
to, for your coming here and listening to

00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:20.170
us. And we thought, "Well, maybe we should
talk about the dire need for groups like Sea

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:31.190
Shepherd right now in the oceans." But we
hate doing gloom speeches. We hate it when

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:39.620
documentaries and stuff do that to us. We're
gonna lighten up on your lunch break. And

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:47.730
so, we decided ultimately that we wanna talk
about--a lot of things that--a lot research

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:56.030
data and our own personal experience out there
in the oceans, say that is the most important

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:04.550
things that we could be doing right now. Now,
the thing is the, the first thing a lot, you

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:13.150
might say, "Well, there's a whole lot of issues
out there like global warming or world hunger

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:20.310
and cultural clashes," but the thing is, the
oceans are so important because their fate,

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.970
the oceans fate, is tied to humanities fate.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.510
[high pitched sound]

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:32.160
&gt;&gt;Lee: Seems, I didn't even mute my own cell
phone, sorry. Go ahead.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.160
[laughter]

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.720
&gt;&gt;Tod: My time's up.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.720
[laughter]

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:43.940
But yeah, they, we also wanna talk about why
we feel so strongly about those three things

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:53.160
that we mentioned. And what we saw out there
made us believe it so much. And why we're

00:05:53.160 --> 00:06:03.110
willing to risk our lives and join Sea Shepherd
in going down there, and get into these battles

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:09.000
and all these things that you see on Whale
Wars. I mean--after all--we're not thrill

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:16.190
seekers, we're not weekend warrior stunt men.
I was a computer geek. I started off working

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.690
at Yahoo. I just left, I'm not evil, either,
so--

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:21.690
[Andrea laughs]

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:27.460
and Andrea's a lawyer. We're not paintball
fanatics or anything like that. So, what was

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:38.490
it that made us drop our nice jobs and our
cushy New York lifestyles and go and put ourselves

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:43.910
in danger? And the answer is, pretty much,
that the oceans are that important. The oceans

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:51.390
are so important--especially now--with all
these disasters happening, like the Gulf and

00:06:51.390 --> 00:07:01.400
with global warming and everything. Because
how we come out as a race, at the end of all

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:11.140
these things, is really gonna be determined
by how healthy our oceans are and how much

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:24.400
life there is in the oceans to replace what
was lost. How much in the oceans can balance

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:35.320
and bring balance and regulate to all the
ecosystems that come out of this OK. And so

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.170
that's why we decided that--

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:41.480
[cell phone rings]

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:51.550
it's important enough to risk our lives for
joining Sea Shepherd. And we've picked Sea

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:59.250
Shepherd, in particular, because it's so effective.
Sea Shepherd is a very effective group. We're

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:06.340
not a group of protesters. We don't wave signs
and banners and ask poachers to stop killing

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:13.580
whales. When we say we're gonna save whales,
we actually go and save whales. A lot of people

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:23.540
know of our Antarctic campaign. That's our
most famous one. But we also do a whole lot

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:30.920
of other campaigns around the world. Right
now, Sea Shepherd's main ship, the Steve Irwin--or

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:41.960
one of our two ships--the Steve Irwin is in
the Mediterranean right now saving the last

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:53.639
of the blue fin tuna on earth. Some of the
last ones from illegal poaching. We also do

00:08:53.639 --> 00:09:04.149
anti-long-lining campaigns and we also do
anti bottom trawling campaigns. Bottom trawling

00:09:04.149 --> 00:09:14.070
is probably the worst ecological disaster
that we cause on purpose. And we save baby

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:26.180
seals in Canada from the seal clubbing and
we have a field office in Galapagos. That's

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:33.360
very effective, actually, because that field
office works directly with the Ecuadorian

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:41.440
government in protecting the marine reserve
there. So, the more we found out, the more

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:56.589
willing I was to give up this lifestyle and
just go out there and save as much as I could.

00:09:56.589 --> 00:10:03.130
When Sea Shepherd called and said, "Hey, do
wanna come down to the Antarctic? Can you

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:09.329
actually buy a ticket tonight to come to Australia
to meet our ship?" I jumped to the chance.

00:10:09.329 --> 00:10:16.399
I bought a ticket, I quit my job that day,
I flew down to Australia in a couple days.

00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:26.120
I got off the plane and realized I didn't
know where to go. I asked people, "Where do

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.970
you keep your ships in this town?"

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:30.970
[laughter]

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:41.050
I went down there. I was an American tourist
looking for Steve Irwin, that came off as

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:43.420
well as it sounds.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.420
[laughter]

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:53.680
But then, like within less than a week with
this group we went down there and we saved

00:10:53.680 --> 00:11:02.730
500 whales from getting harpooned. And so,
it's just direct action like that that makes

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:11.050
us really want to just keep on working with
Sea Shepherd all the time.

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:14.650
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Mm-hmm. And.

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:17.220
&gt;&gt;Lee: So, go ahead.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:25.230
&gt;&gt;Andrea: OK. And when I first stumbled on
Sea Shepherd, I had found out about Sea Shepherd's

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:35.470
just absolute commitment to saving lives.
And as a public defender I'd always been very

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:40.629
passionate and committed to saving lives.
And I've just been doing that in the courtroom.

00:11:40.629 --> 00:11:45.410
But with Sea Shepherd, I transferred that
passion and commitment to saving lives to

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:54.869
saving our oceans and life in the oceans.
And I remember, I first joined the Bob Barker,

00:11:54.869 --> 00:12:05.040
which is our newest ship and yes, it was actually
bought for by Mr. Bob Barker, the game show

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:20.120
host. He made a generous donation to Sea Shepherd
of five million dollars to buy the ship last

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.270
fall. And--

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:23.519
&gt;&gt;Lee: Five hundred million?

00:12:23.519 --> 00:12:26.350
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Five million. Five million.

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:33.490
&gt;&gt;Lee: Five million. I was like, "God, that's
like [ ]." The Price is Right has been good

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:34.490
to him.

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:35.490
[laughter]

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:41.100
&gt;&gt;Andrea: No, five million. And, and we had
just bought the ship and in Ghana and actually,

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:48.360
interestingly enough, it was a former Norwegian
whaling vessel. But now we're using that same

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:53.120
Norwegian whaling vessel to actually go down
and save whales. So, but I remember the first

00:12:53.120 --> 00:13:05.940
day that we were on the ship and there were
migrating whales that came alongside the ship.

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:13.009
And these migrating whales were actually down
on their way to the whale sanctuary in Antarctica.

00:13:13.009 --> 00:13:23.480
And, at the time, all I could think about
was, "Oh my gosh, these are the same whales

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:30.379
that are headed a few thousand miles down
to the Southern Ocean and we have to be there.

00:13:30.379 --> 00:13:37.690
We have to get the ship ready to be able to
save them because we're gonna be their only

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:43.550
defense, once they're down in the Southern
ocean, from the criminal whaling operation."

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:51.870
But that was my thought was just a few months
down the line, we're gonna have to save these

00:13:51.870 --> 00:14:00.350
whales. Well, later that day, I started really
noticing that all around us in the ocean--and

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:06.740
where these whales were migrating--there was
actually plastic bags floating everywhere.

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:18.040
And whales, turtles, birds and other animals,
they actually eat plastic thinking that it

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:22.160
was food. Because millions of years of evolution,
unfortunately, hasn't prepared them for the

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:26.480
reality that now that there's plastic all
in the oceans, we actually very much have

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:32.519
a plastic sea. And all this plastic, it was
coming down out of rivers off the mainland.

00:14:32.519 --> 00:14:37.540
And it's the very same thing that's going
on here in New York. In Manhattan, we're on

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:43.370
an island. And during a windy day or storm,
all the trash, all the loose plastic bags,

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:49.290
all the cigarette butts, everything else,
it just blows right into the Hudson River,

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:58.410
into the East River. And actually ends up
in the same place in the oceans that the trash

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:05.519
off Western Africa does. And the trash all
congregates in these huge, floating, plastic,

00:15:05.519 --> 00:15:11.769
swirling gyres in the ocean. And researchers
have actually found that the, the density

00:15:11.769 --> 00:15:18.369
of plastic to plankton is six to one in these
areas. So, it was just--it's just flabbergasting.

00:15:18.369 --> 00:15:25.800
It's the same thing as if you were eating
your morning cereal and there's six time as

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:39.899
much plastic in your cereal as actual cereal,
but you can't tell the difference what's what.

00:15:39.899 --> 00:15:47.649
And so that's what's going on in, in the oceans
right now. And it's just because people let

00:15:47.649 --> 00:15:54.889
their trash go into the rivers, which goes
right into the oceans. And so that's actually

00:15:54.889 --> 00:15:59.910
how we came up with the first thing that we
think people can do to help save the oceans

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:08.300
and just less than five minutes a day and
that's to take a reusable shopping bag with

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:19.589
you when you, when you go out for the day.
There's little ones that fit in your pocket,

00:16:19.589 --> 00:16:28.980
fit over your shoulder, take it with you.
They're small, they're sturdy and uses even

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:37.730
less plastic and petroleum to produce those.
And same with the water bottles, which I know,

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:51.110
I know Google's already working on, so that's
great. And that was just what I saw, though,

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:53.730
in the first day of--

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:54.779
[man coughs]

00:16:54.779 --> 00:17:02.740
being on a ship. And that night, though, was
a whole nother story. And it presented a whole

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:08.919
nother danger to the whales. Because what
happened that first night was that there were

00:17:08.919 --> 00:17:15.939
all these fishing ships that came out. And
there was fishing nets everywhere and fishing

00:17:15.939 --> 00:17:23.550
ships. And even with our radar and binoculars,
we actually had trouble navigating through

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:31.280
all these fishing nets. And, and I thought,
"Oh my gosh, how are the whales gonna navigate

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:37.779
through these?" And, unfortunately, whales
don't always make it through. And I suspect

00:17:37.779 --> 00:17:45.409
that not all the whales that we saw migrating
probably even made it down to the Southern

00:17:45.409 --> 00:17:51.620
Ocean Whale Sanctuary. Because, unfortunately,
commercial fishing uses massive, massive nets

00:17:51.620 --> 00:18:00.230
and whales, dolphins, sea birds, turtles and
everything else, happens to swim into it just

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:15.559
to catch a few specific fish. And, while most
people don't eat whale, most people do eat

00:18:15.559 --> 00:18:23.899
fish. And so, part of protecting the whales
and protecting the oceans is, is not eating

00:18:23.899 --> 00:18:43.190
fish. And that's how we came up with the second
thing, which is to forgo the fish. And this

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:56.529
also hit home a lot more, actually. Jumping
ahead to our very last day of the campaign,

00:18:56.529 --> 00:19:16.070
we were all--at this point--we were all the
way down in Antarctica, by the continent.

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:29.590
And this is far, far, far as you can get from
humanity. We were down this beautiful, beautiful

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:39.690
area called Mackenzie Bay, down by the continent.
And this was as area that was so pristine

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:48.340
and stunning and just was full of whales and
seals and birds and penguins and really just

00:19:48.340 --> 00:20:09.331
a realm that was for them. It was a ice realm,
a watery realm and it was a realm just for

00:20:09.331 --> 00:20:20.940
those animals in that sanctuary. But, as we
were chasing a whaling ship, we happened to

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:30.550
pass a bright orange buoy and later on we
stopped to investigate. And it turned out

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:40.200
this buoy was an illegally set fishing net
and it was five miles long. So, it was a fishing

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:49.549
net that actually would have stretched from
Battery Park all the way up to Central Park.

00:20:49.549 --> 00:20:57.620
And it was gonna catch every single thing
that swam into it. And so, as Sea Shepherd

00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:07.269
and as law enforcement organization and as
a marine conservation organization, we confiscated

00:21:07.269 --> 00:21:16.090
that net. And as we were leaving Mackenzie
Bay, we actually caught that ship and it had

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:34.380
set another net. So, it was ten miles of fishing
line all the down in Antarctica. And what's

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:44.159
significant about that is not just that there's
illegal fishing all the way at the end of

00:21:44.159 --> 00:21:59.570
the planet. But that there's fishing at all,
all the way at the end of the planet. And

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:14.010
the reason that there's fishing all the way
by Antarctica is because all the big fish

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:27.440
are gone in the oceans. And since 1950, industrial
fishing has taken out 90 percent of all big

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:32.669
fish in the oceans. I mean, think, this planet
is four billion years old, 60 years isn't

00:22:32.669 --> 00:22:39.159
even hardly a blink in our lifetime, in this
planets lifetime. And so, that means that

00:22:39.159 --> 00:22:53.289
we're actually in the middle of a mass extinction
and it's a mass extinction in our oceans.

00:22:53.289 --> 00:23:03.750
And our oceans cover 70 percent of this planet.
We're a blue planet. So it's a huge, huge

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:09.450
emergency what's going on in our oceans. And
that's, that's why we're willing to risk our

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:19.990
lives to save the last ten percent of the
fish and the shadow populations of whales

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:35.190
that still are in our oceans. And we personally
think that what we should be doing is not

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:43.210
talking about how we can just keep continue
eating the last ten percent of the fish that

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:49.409
are in the oceans, but how we can have we
can have that natural abundance of fish and

00:23:49.409 --> 00:23:50.409
biodiversity and life on this planet and how
we can go back to having a perfect ocean.

00:23:50.409 --> 00:23:54.549
&gt;&gt;Lee: So, so guys, I guess with, with the
BP oil spill--

00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:55.549
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Mm-hmm.

00:23:55.549 --> 00:23:58.620
&gt;Lee: happening, a lot of questions come up
about market driven accountability, right?

00:23:58.620 --> 00:23:59.620
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Mm-hmm.

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:03.860
&gt;&gt;Lee: So, tell me about how, I mean, I know
this is kinda the awesome objective of Sea

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:12.280
Shepherd to disrupt and to cost as much money
as possible to these operations, to effectively

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:18.220
kind of achieve the same goal as saving a
whale, right?

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:19.309
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Mm-hmm.

00:24:19.309 --> 00:24:28.299
&gt;&gt;Lee: So tell me about some of the operations
where you guys, as opposed to not just directly

00:24:28.299 --> 00:24:36.419
saving a specific whale, but some of the other
kind of activities that you guys do. To kinda

00:24:36.419 --> 00:24:39.860
help, like, cost them as much money as possible
I guess, right?

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:45.070
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Right. Right, well, a lot, a lot
of this is driven by economics. And so with

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:49.049
the whaling, well--just going back to the
whaling operation though--when we save over

00:24:49.049 --> 00:24:55.889
500 whales, we're costing them millions of
dollars every year. And a lot of what's going

00:24:55.889 --> 00:25:00.639
on is this is actually being subsidized by
governments, in the way of fuel subsidies

00:25:00.639 --> 00:25:09.279
and also just direct fishing subsidies. So,
addressing those and costing them that much

00:25:09.279 --> 00:25:16.289
money economically, it does cut down and it
will stop whaling and sink the whaling fleet

00:25:16.289 --> 00:25:23.019
economically. And same with the fishing fleets.
They operate on a very small margin a lot

00:25:23.019 --> 00:25:30.190
of times of profit. Say, for example, bottom
trawling. The only reason--what bottom trawling

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:35.929
is--is basically bulldozing the ocean floor
and coral, there's deep sea coral, just bulldozing

00:25:35.929 --> 00:25:43.330
it to catch a few fish. So, it's the same
thing as, just bulldozing the rain forest

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:53.480
to catch a few birds. So what we--what Sea
Shepherd has done is they--we did a deep sea

00:25:53.480 --> 00:26:00.820
bottom trawling campaign to stop areas of
illegal bottom trawling. And since bottom

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:09.750
trawlers, there's only about two hundred ships
worldwide that are causing all this destruction

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:12.940
and they operate on fishing subsidies. And
actually it wouldn't be possible or profitable

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:17.200
for them to continue some of those fishing
without some of the fishing subsidies, but

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.350
it all revolves around economics.

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:22.620
&gt;&gt;Lee: I see. So, do you have any examples?

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:28.889
&gt;&gt;Tod: Well, in the Galapagos, we always also
have a pretty fun exercise where we have a

00:26:28.889 --> 00:26:36.230
lot of poaching equipment and poaching operations
in the marine reserve. And actually, each

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:48.019
week, we're seeing them coming from countries
further and further away cause there's just

00:26:48.019 --> 00:27:03.509
no fish in between the Galapagos and, and
even Asia, China now. And so we find a lot

00:27:03.509 --> 00:27:13.500
of this equipment in the park. So what we
do is that we take it because--it's more--it

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:30.139
cost more than our stuff, so we might as well
use it. And then we take it apart and we re-purpose

00:27:30.139 --> 00:27:40.720
them into things that we can try to use to
save the environment, like our office in Galapagos,

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:47.350
now partially powered by solar panels that
we've taken from marine buoys that are used

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:52.250
as fish aggregate devices. And we use antennas--

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:54.259
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Mm-hmm.

00:27:54.259 --> 00:28:04.679
&gt;&gt;Tod: that we take from a lot of these fish
devices, use them in our communications gear.

00:28:04.679 --> 00:28:11.770
And so I like the, I like this project because
I like irony. And so--

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:17.270
&gt;&gt;Lee: Effectively, you're having like the
whalers equipment is kinda of helping you

00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:18.960
guys achieve your goal?

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:19.960
&gt;&gt;Tod: Yes.

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:21.500
&gt;&gt;Lee: By disrupting them?

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:27.169
&gt;&gt;Tod: Yeah. They got higher priced stuff,
we might as well use theirs.

00:28:27.169 --> 00:28:28.169
[laughter]

00:28:28.169 --> 00:28:33.429
&gt;&gt;Lee: That's something kinda cool. So, what
else? I guess--some of the operations--you

00:28:33.429 --> 00:28:38.309
said you were up in Canada saving the, the
baby seals--

00:28:38.309 --> 00:28:39.350
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Mm-hmm.

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:47.299
&gt;&gt;Lee: or, or maybe some of the stuff cause
you are, I guess, you're the new season of

00:28:47.299 --> 00:28:48.940
Whale Wars that starts tomorrow?

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:54.480
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Right, it airs tomorrow night on
Animal Planet at 9 and it'll be on every Friday

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.480
night this summer.

00:28:55.480 --> 00:29:02.039
&gt;&gt;Lee: And so what would we, what do they
cut from what they're gonna show on TV? Like

00:29:02.039 --> 00:29:08.120
what, could you tell us something that happened
that they won't show on TV or is it, is it

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.820
all pretty much there?

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:10.820
[Andrea laughs]

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:14.490
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Well, Animal Planet does document
everything that happens--

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:15.490
&gt;&gt;Lee: Mm-hmm.

00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:20.600
&gt;&gt;Andrea: on the show. I mean, on our battle
to save the whales. I actually haven't seen

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:23.179
the new season, so I don't know what's--

00:29:23.179 --> 00:29:26.730
&gt;&gt;Lee: Oh, you mean you don't know what, what's
gonna play?

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:29.909
&gt;&gt;Andrea: I'm not sure what's on it.

00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:31.769
[Lee and Andrea laugh]

00:29:31.769 --> 00:29:41.740
&gt;&gt;Lee: That'll be interesting. So, I guess
we can open up for questions if anyone wants

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:51.710
to jump at one of these microphones on your
side. Ask any questions, talk about anything

00:29:51.710 --> 00:30:00.480
that's on your mind, I'm sure these guys will
be happy to oblige. Zack.

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.830
&gt;&gt;Zack: Hello.

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:03.190
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Hi.

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:04.550
&gt;&gt;Tod: Hi.

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:05.900
&gt;&gt;Zack: Hello.

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:07.940
&gt;&gt;Lee: Hey, John.

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:12.080
&gt;&gt;John: Should I turn it on?

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.620
&gt;&gt;Lee: It's on down here.

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:17.230
&gt;&gt;Zack: It's on down here?

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:26.409
&gt;&gt;Lee: It is. I think John's gonna un-mute
if for you in a second.

00:30:26.409 --> 00:30:28.970
&gt;&gt;Zack: Greetings. Welcome.

00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:30.679
[Andrea laughs]

00:30:30.679 --> 00:30:38.350
Thanks for coming, it's great you guys are
here.

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:42.620
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Thanks for having us.

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:52.400
&gt;&gt;Zack: My question is, so you talked about
your regular life before you guys started

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.700
doing this--

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.010
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Right.

00:30:55.010 --> 00:31:06.730
&gt;&gt;Zack: so, can you just talk more about that?
I mean, had you lived on boat for a long time

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:24.460
before? What's it really like to be doing
this with the iconic characters that you're

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:30.770
around? And how do you feel living this sort
of idealistic driven life instead of the one

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:34.100
that you had previously? And you're on land
right now. Are you making money and how are

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:36.499
you alive right now? Are you employed by Sea
Shepherd all the time?

00:31:36.499 --> 00:31:37.789
&gt;&gt;Tod: Why are you alive?

00:31:37.789 --> 00:31:38.789
[laughter]

00:31:38.789 --> 00:31:40.880
&gt;&gt;Zack: Yeah, how are you alive? Talk more
about your life.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:41.880
[audience member coughs]

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.440
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Do you wanna turn?

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:47.659
&gt;&gt;Tod: Well, I'm actually--now that I'm back--cause
I've been back from our most recent campaign

00:31:47.659 --> 00:32:02.320
in the Galapagos for quite a few months now.
So I got another programming job, actually

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:12.300
down at Hudson Street. I'm making websites
again. And I'm not doing this as a pitch to

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:15.860
work for Google or anything.

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:17.289
[Andrea chuckles]

00:32:17.289 --> 00:32:18.720
But, yeah--

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:20.149
[Andrea laughs]

00:32:20.149 --> 00:32:27.249
when we're around in town, we usually work
and live our--

00:32:27.249 --> 00:32:34.120
&gt;&gt;Zack: Do you just wanna do some coding interviews
today?

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:35.120
[laughter]

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:38.240
&gt;&gt;Tod: Yeah, that's for me.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:39.240
[laughter]

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:46.019
&gt;&gt;Zack: I mean, we'll just walk you down the
hall, just to--

00:32:46.019 --> 00:32:47.019
[laughter]

00:32:47.019 --> 00:32:57.759
&gt;&gt;Tod: When I'm in town, I usually work. Fortunately,
programming is something that I can do on

00:32:57.759 --> 00:33:10.440
a freelance basis. When I'm in town or sometimes
when I'm working in the Galapagos, in my off

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:25.970
time, I'll do contract jobs for companies
here in the states. Fortunately, it's something

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:42.850
I can pick up and drop pretty easily. I've
been doing it for a long time and then, yeah,

00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:45.340
so hire me.

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:47.820
&gt;&gt;Zack: All right.

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:48.820
[laughter]

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:53.620
&gt;&gt;Lee: Any other, any other questions?

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:55.279
&gt;&gt;Andrea: But--

00:33:55.279 --> 00:34:00.249
&gt;&gt;Lee: Oh, sorry, sorry. Go ahead.

00:34:00.249 --> 00:34:12.369
&gt;&gt;Andrea: That's OK. In answer to your question,
it is kind of a big change to go and live

00:34:12.369 --> 00:34:14.609
on a ship. And I think--

00:34:14.609 --> 00:34:15.960
[audience member coughs]

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:25.629
our ship, I was on it for six months and it
was probably about the size of this room here.

00:34:25.629 --> 00:34:32.919
And so it is a big change, but at the same
time, I think I'm, I've been so passionate

00:34:32.919 --> 00:34:42.050
about saving lives and I believe so much in
what Sea Shepherd's doing. And I believe also

00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:52.730
so much in being a public defender and helping
people and saving lives that way, that it

00:34:52.730 --> 00:35:04.180
wasn't such a big change and it wasn't a mental
leap or an emotional leap. And so, in that

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:12.780
sense, it was very easy for me to transition.
And, actually, I had just been taking a sabbatical

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:22.630
over the last year and so I'd been using that
time to work with Sea Shepherd.

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:33.450
&gt;&gt;Tod: Actually, in answer to have we been
on boats before, actually before I served

00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:44.160
with Sea Shepherd, I don't think I've even
been on a boat except for maybe the Station

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:56.730
Island Ferry, actually. And the cabin that
I got was actually the forward most cabin

00:35:56.730 --> 00:36:06.130
on the ship, which was a good, yeah, introduction
to--

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:07.410
[Andrea laughs]

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:24.380
ship life. They call it the “zero g chamber”
and I asked why and they said, "Oh, you'll

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:41.240
find out." And I found out that night, the
first night, because I woke up airborne off

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:50.869
of my bunk. And I had to learn over time how
to wedge myself in-between walls in my cabin

00:36:50.869 --> 00:36:57.410
in various ways to basically wedge myself
between objects in order to sleep.

00:36:57.410 --> 00:37:02.359
&gt;&gt;man in audience2: How are you sea legs?

00:37:02.359 --> 00:37:12.980
&gt;&gt;Tod: Oh, they were great. Actually, when
we went out there, I was one of the only people

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:25.410
that didn't get sea sick. And I think it's
because I play so many video games compared

00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:29.300
to the other crew that--

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:30.849
[Andrea laughs]

00:37:30.849 --> 00:37:47.589
I was used to that motion and everything.
When we all came off the ship, we actually

00:37:47.589 --> 00:38:00.480
all got land sick again. So, the first thing
we did was we all walked off of the ship like

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:13.530
at the same time and we all stood there and
we were all doing this simultaneously.

00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:14.849
[Andrea laughs]

00:38:14.849 --> 00:38:20.050
As if we all had iPods on, we're like listening
to something, yeah.

00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:21.050
&gt;&gt;Lee: Sir?

00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:24.790
&gt;&gt;man in audience3: I was wondering if you
guys could talk a little bit more about the

00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:29.430
ship operations. Because right now you have,
what, four or five active ships? And I know

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:36.190
on the show you have the two new ones down
there and stuff like that.

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:37.190
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Mm-hmm.

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:44.290
&gt;&gt;man in audience3: But how do you guys decide
where which ships are going during which seasons

00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:45.290
and--

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:46.290
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Mm-hmm.

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:49.540
&gt;&gt;man in audience3: how do you sort of coordinate
that with having a TV show?

00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:58.020
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Well, we actually had three active
ships go down to our last campaign in the

00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:01.990
Antarctic. That was our flagship the Steve
Irwin, our newest ship, which is the, the

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:08.710
Bob Barker, and we had taken down a third
ship, which was our fast boat and that was

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:13.490
the Ady Gil. But, we only came back with two
ships. The Japanese whalers intentionally

00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:24.980
sunk the Ady Gil. So we came back with two
ships and we have two main, active ships right

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:25.980
now.

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:29.200
&gt;&gt;Lee: That, that's that wave piercing--

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.619
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Yes.

00:39:30.619 --> 00:39:35.470
&gt;&gt;Lee: it looks like a Batmobile on water,
right?

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:36.470
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Yes, yes.

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:38.319
&gt;&gt;Tod: Sinking the Batmobile, yeah.

00:39:38.319 --> 00:39:39.720
[Andrea laughs]

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:42.720
&gt;&gt;Andrea: A very futuristic ship.

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:44.400
&gt;&gt;Lee: So, what happened?

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:45.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: With--

00:39:45.849 --> 00:39:49.110
&gt;&gt;Lee: Is it gonna spoil the, is it gonna
spoil the show--

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:50.110
[Andrea laughs]

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:54.330
if you tell us how it got sank, I mean how
they sunk it?

00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:57.721
&gt;&gt;Andrea: No, well the, the whalers intentionally,
that the Ady Gil was actually stopped and

00:39:57.721 --> 00:40:16.500
the whalers intentionally turned into the
Ady Gil and split it right in two. And I,

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:18.329
I saw the whole thing happen and I just couldn't
believe that we weren't actually pulling bodies

00:40:18.329 --> 00:40:19.329
out of the water.

00:40:19.329 --> 00:40:20.329
&gt;&gt;Lee: So, no, so has anyone ever died in
any Sea Shepherd operations?

00:40:20.329 --> 00:40:21.329
&gt;&gt;Andrea: No, Sea Shepherd has a meticulous
safety record. And we've never had any serious

00:40:21.329 --> 00:40:24.119
injuries. And actually, it was one of our
first injuries was one of the people in the

00:40:24.119 --> 00:40:26.430
Ady Gil had two bruised ribs, but luckily
that was healed.

00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:31.030
&gt;&gt;Lee: So are there any like, I'm sure their
like guidelines, but are there rules to engagement?

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:40.290
Are there certain lines that you can or cannot
cross or is it something that's left up to

00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:44.430
the individual to kind of decide? How is that
structured? I imagine--

00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:45.430
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Mm-hmm.

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:52.180
&gt;&gt;Lee: it's very hierarchical with the captain
with what you can and cannot do--

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:53.940
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Sure.

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:58.150
&gt;&gt;Lee: so, where, how does that line, where
is that line sitting and, and how does it

00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:59.870
move? Or does it?

00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:03.130
&gt;&gt;Tod: Battles look chaotic and stuff when
you see them on the show, etc. Especially

00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:06.540
when everyone is shooting at each other and
stuff, but it's actually very, very well planned.

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:07.550
Everything is meticulously planned and well
placed. For instance, when we attacked the

00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:08.550
Nishu Maru with, with our stink bombs and
so forth--

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:09.550
&gt;&gt;Lee: Mm-hmm.

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:10.990
&gt;&gt;Tod: We're aiming only for whaling decks
that no people are on because the number one

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:17.660
rule is that you can't harm any people. And
so what the stink bombs do is that we're actually

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:20.210
aiming for whaling decks and when the stink
bombs hit the whaling decks, it spoils any

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:21.210
meats that you might put on there so they
can't process whales on there.

00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:22.210
&gt;&gt;Lee: Right. Gotcha.

00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:23.210
&gt;&gt;Tod: It also smells so bad, that after an
attack, we literally have to close all our

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:24.210
portholes and windows--

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:25.210
[Andrea laughs]

00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:26.210
for like a whole week. When we're anywhere
within a half mile of that, cause that how

00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:28.390
bad it stinks. And in fact, we don't see anyone
on their decks for maybe a week after an attack.

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:29.390
[laughter]

00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:30.390
And the other thing that we throw is called
methylcellulose, which we throw on top of

00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:31.390
the stink bombs. And methylcellulose is the
chemical substance coats pills--

00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:32.390
&gt;&gt;Lee: Mm-hmm.

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:33.390
&gt;&gt;Tod: that makes them easier to swallow.
So, when you see people throwing stink bombs

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:34.390
on your decks and stuff, you're first instinct
is to use a hose and wash it off. But when

00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:35.390
you wash off the methylcellulose, moisture
activates it and makes it super slippery so

00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:36.390
you can't wash anything off of it. So, it
looks really chaotic, but it's, it's really

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:37.640
very well planned. One of the only spontaneous
things that we threw was this, there was this

00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:39.250
horrible vegan salad dressing that we no one
like on the ship.

00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:40.250
[Andrea laughs]

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:46.920
And, and we're starting to run out of things
to throw and we're like, "What do we throw

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:47.920
out?" And we're like, "Let's get rid of the
salad dressing."

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:48.920
[Andrea laughs]

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:49.920
And so we chucked the salad dressing, we just
thought, "Oh,that's the end of that, this

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:50.920
horrible imitation blue cheese stuff."

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:52.950
[Andrea laughs]

00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:54.000
And we thought that was the end of that, and
then two days later, the front line, the front

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000
headlines out of Japan were, "Terrorist group
throws white chemical substance."

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000
[Andrea laughs]

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000
And what is it? Is it anthrax?

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.000
[laughter]

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.000
What could they have? They had people with
hazmat suits out there. They're like --so

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.000
they never released their research findings
on it.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000
[laughter]

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000
&gt;&gt;Lee: I imagine not. No, blue cheese, ill
prepared. Let's see, what else. So, I know

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000
on the side of the ship it'll say, "We've
sunk X amount of vessels," or whatever--

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000
&gt;&gt;Tod: Mm-hmm.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000
&gt;&gt;Lee: I mean, is it, we've never seen that
happen on the show. Is it something--do you

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000
do it at sea? And I know people will be like,
"Well, that's not right. You shouldn't go

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000
and sink vessels because people could die
and that kind of thing." So, tell me more

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000
about how, how you guys sink vessels.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Well, Sea Shepherd has a long history
of protecting whales and it actually started

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.000
back in the late 70s. And Paul Watson, whose
our founder, he went after a pirate whaling

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.000
ship named the Sierra. And the Sierra was
a pirate whaling ship and it wasn't registered

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000
to anyone and it just went around the world
killing whales. So, Sea Shepherd has a strict

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000
nonviolence policy and to take out the Sierra,
the pirate whaling ship, Sea Shepherd sunk

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000
it while it was in port and nobody was on
board. So, Sea Shepherd has a very, very strict

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.000
policy on not harming people and saving lives.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.000
&gt;&gt;Lee: So what about like other environmental
damage like fuel and stuff? Like, do you,

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.080
so they sink a vessel, does, is there a risk
of say, the ships fuel or oil or whatever

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:18.080
is spilling into the ocean, or how does that?

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:19.190
&gt;&gt;Andrea: You can't, well, what actually happened
during the last campaign when the whalers

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:21.849
sunk our ship, which was the Ady Gil. And
there were six people on board. Was we, on

00:42:21.849 --> 00:42:22.849
the Bob Barker, we actually did a rescue operation.
We made sure to empty the ship of any fuel

00:42:22.849 --> 00:42:23.849
or oil on board, so it didn't sink immediately.
And by the time that it did sink, we managed

00:42:23.849 --> 00:42:24.849
to get all the toxic substances off.

00:42:24.849 --> 00:42:25.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: Well that's cool. So, you guys do have
a, I mean, you guys are responsible with your

00:42:25.849 --> 00:42:26.849
actions.

00:42:26.849 --> 00:42:27.849
[Andrea laughs]

00:42:27.849 --> 00:42:28.849
It's not like you're just going, I mean, so-,
some, I mean there's some controversy about,

00:42:28.849 --> 00:42:29.849
about how you, what the methods you guys use,
so, I was, I had, I was just interested on

00:42:29.849 --> 00:42:30.849
how you guys mitigated those other--

00:42:30.849 --> 00:42:31.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Sure, we absolutely have taken care
of the environment and protection of life

00:42:31.849 --> 00:42:32.849
as our number one priority.

00:42:32.849 --> 00:42:33.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: So, I, I, and I'm a little guilty.
I eat, I eat fish. I eat meat, I eat, I know

00:42:33.849 --> 00:42:34.849
you guys are completely vegan operation when
you're out on the sea, but I, I don't plan

00:42:34.849 --> 00:42:35.849
on stop, I don't plan on not eating fish--

00:42:35.849 --> 00:42:36.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Mm-hmm.

00:42:36.849 --> 00:42:37.849
&gt;Lee: next week or next month, but I, I do,
I have reduced, tremendously, the amount of

00:42:37.849 --> 00:42:38.849
fish that I have eaten. I eat less tuna.

00:42:38.849 --> 00:42:39.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Great.

00:42:39.849 --> 00:42:40.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: I eat a bit more salmon that I, then--

00:42:40.849 --> 00:42:41.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Uh-huh.

00:42:41.849 --> 00:42:42.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: I shifted, I do eat sushi, we have
sushi here.

00:42:42.849 --> 00:42:43.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Uh-huh.

00:42:43.849 --> 00:42:44.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: I'm sure there's people that eat fish
here. I wanna be able to continue to have

00:42:44.849 --> 00:42:45.849
salmon in 30 years or so.

00:42:45.849 --> 00:42:46.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Uh-huh.

00:42:46.849 --> 00:42:47.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: S-,

00:42:47.849 --> 00:42:48.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Sure.

00:42:48.849 --> 00:42:49.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: I want my children to have--

00:42:49.849 --> 00:42:50.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Mm-hmm.

00:42:50.849 --> 00:42:51.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: to be able to taste--

00:42:51.849 --> 00:42:52.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Right.

00:42:52.849 --> 00:42:53.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: Maybe they don't eat it all the time,
but it would be nice for them to be able to

00:42:53.849 --> 00:42:54.849
experience it. So, that, that make me think
that well, responsible fishing is, is, is--

00:42:54.849 --> 00:42:55.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Mm-hmm.

00:42:55.849 --> 00:42:56.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: probably the best way so we can have
some kinda sustainable, for the industry,

00:42:56.849 --> 00:42:57.849
for, for the species, and for the oceans and
for the livelihood of, of everyone. Do you

00:42:57.849 --> 00:42:58.849
think that's, that's a fair compromise for
people that, that do still continue to eat

00:42:58.849 --> 00:42:59.849
fish? Or do you think, but I don't--

00:42:59.849 --> 00:43:00.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Uh-huh.

00:43:00.849 --> 00:43:01.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: if I'm asking way too many questions,
but--

00:43:01.849 --> 00:43:02.849
[Andrea laughs]

00:43:02.849 --> 00:43:03.849
from a policy standpoint, do you think we're
going in the right direction? Do you think,

00:43:03.849 --> 00:43:04.849
I watch the show Deadliest Catch also--

00:43:04.849 --> 00:43:05.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Uh-huh.

00:43:05.849 --> 00:43:06.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: horrible, exact opposite of, of you
guys' show--

00:43:06.849 --> 00:43:07.849
[Andrea laughs]

00:43:07.849 --> 00:43:08.849
but I've seen, in that show, in the course
of three years that they've, that they have

00:43:08.849 --> 00:43:09.849
a quota system, they're pretty strict about
the rules and it seems like with visibility

00:43:09.849 --> 00:43:10.849
into that industry--

00:43:10.849 --> 00:43:11.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Mm-hmm.

00:43:11.849 --> 00:43:12.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: it's changed how they operate, and
maybe for the better. Maybe not, I'm not sure,

00:43:12.849 --> 00:43:13.849
I don't know all the details, but what do
you guys think about that?

00:43:13.849 --> 00:43:14.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Well, I definitely think sustainable
fishing may be a step in the right direction

00:43:14.849 --> 00:43:15.849
and I think Google's taking a lead in that,
but it's just not enough at this point. And

00:43:15.849 --> 00:43:16.849
we all wanna see a future where there are
fish, a future where there are whales and

00:43:16.849 --> 00:43:17.849
animals in the oceans and there, unfortunately,
have been a lot of problems with the sustainability

00:43:17.849 --> 00:43:18.849
quotas and how different organizations say
that one certain fish is sustainable. For

00:43:18.849 --> 00:43:19.849
example, ahi tuna, three different organizations
labeled it differently. One said that it was

00:43:19.849 --> 00:43:20.849
safe; another said that it was a void and
one kinda in the middle. So, there've been

00:43:20.849 --> 00:43:21.849
a lot of problems with that and then factoring
in illegal fishing, which, which completely

00:43:21.849 --> 00:43:22.849
skews all the statistics--

00:43:22.849 --> 00:43:23.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: Right,

00:43:23.849 --> 00:43:24.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: it's almost impossible, at this
point, to really and accurately evaluate how

00:43:24.849 --> 00:43:25.849
many fish are left in the oceans as far as
what we can take of the last ten percent and

00:43:25.849 --> 00:43:26.849
how. But generally, its, its guiding principles
on what to eat. It's better to eat lower on

00:43:26.849 --> 00:43:27.849
the food web.

00:43:27.849 --> 00:43:28.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: Sure.

00:43:28.849 --> 00:43:29.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: And instead of eating the top predatory
animals, the more people have a plant based

00:43:29.849 --> 00:43:30.849
diet and eat lower on the food web, it's,
it's better for the planet.

00:43:30.849 --> 00:43:31.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: Sure.

00:43:31.849 --> 00:43:32.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Generally, along with organic and
local food.

00:43:32.849 --> 00:43:33.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: OK.

00:43:33.849 --> 00:43:34.849
&gt;&gt;Tod: And that includes pet food, too.

00:43:34.849 --> 00:43:35.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: Really?

00:43:35.849 --> 00:43:36.849
&gt;&gt;Tod: Yeah, a lot of people say, "Oh, it's
natural to give tuna to your cat." It's not,

00:43:36.849 --> 00:43:37.849
you're cats never stood by the water with
[inaudible]--

00:43:37.849 --> 00:43:38.849
[laughter]

00:43:38.849 --> 00:43:39.849
taking out this creature and--

00:43:39.849 --> 00:43:40.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: blue tuna like, like this?

00:43:40.849 --> 00:43:41.849
&gt;&gt;Tod: Taking pictures of my cut.

00:43:41.849 --> 00:43:42.849
[laughter]

00:43:42.849 --> 00:43:43.849
Yeah, but that's a big source of fish usage
that people don't really think about, but

00:43:43.849 --> 00:43:44.849
is a huge contributor to the problem, so.

00:43:44.849 --> 00:43:45.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Mm-hmm.

00:43:45.849 --> 00:43:46.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: Cool.

00:43:46.849 --> 00:43:47.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Yes.

00:43:47.849 --> 00:43:48.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: Any other questions from the, the crowd?

00:43:48.849 --> 00:43:49.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: OK,

00:43:49.849 --> 00:43:50.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: Thoughts, solutions?

00:43:50.849 --> 00:43:51.849
[Andrea laughs]

00:43:51.849 --> 00:43:52.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Yeah.

00:43:52.849 --> 00:43:53.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: So another thing that I guess--

00:43:53.849 --> 00:43:54.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Mm-hmm.

00:43:54.849 --> 00:43:55.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: when I was watching the show was like
other,--

00:43:55.849 --> 00:43:56.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Mm-hmm.

00:43:56.849 --> 00:43:57.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: other ways to have, other ways to kind
of like disrupt that or whatever. Like, "Well,

00:43:57.849 --> 00:43:58.849
I would take the helicopter and why don't
you give him the acid and drop it from above."

00:43:58.849 --> 00:43:59.849
Then the water, the spray things don't, you,
they can't defend against it.

00:43:59.849 --> 00:44:00.849
[laughter]

00:44:00.849 --> 00:44:01.849
So, are there, I guess, is that, is that something
you guys, what, would try or are there certain

00:44:01.849 --> 00:44:02.849
rules, "Well, we don't want that, we only
carry one thing." It's not safe for him to

00:44:02.849 --> 00:44:03.849
be--

00:44:03.849 --> 00:44:04.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Mm-hmm.

00:44:04.849 --> 00:44:05.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: dropping acid, or are they gonna start
attacking the helicopters kinda thing? Is,

00:44:05.849 --> 00:44:06.849
how does that work?

00:44:06.849 --> 00:44:07.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Chris Aultman, our helicopter pilot,
he is licensed so he's not gonna do anything

00:44:07.849 --> 00:44:08.849
that would risk losing his license. Also,
we don't want the helicopter to become the

00:44:08.849 --> 00:44:09.849
object of attack by the whalers, which they've
actually tried to do before.

00:44:09.849 --> 00:44:10.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: Sure.

00:44:10.849 --> 00:44:11.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: But it's so risky to the people
in the helicopter and there's such a large

00:44:11.849 --> 00:44:12.849
risk of human life that it's not something
that we do.

00:44:12.849 --> 00:44:13.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: Just keep it more like your reconnaissance
vehicle?

00:44:13.849 --> 00:44:14.849
&gt;&gt;Tod: Yes.

00:44:14.849 --> 00:44:15.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: So what's next after the Ady Gil? The,
the carbon fiber Batmobile--

00:44:15.849 --> 00:44:16.849
[Andrea laughs]

00:44:16.849 --> 00:44:17.849
is, I mean, are they gonna, I mean, repair
it? Are they going to--

00:44:17.849 --> 00:44:18.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Oh, well the Ady Gil is sunk.

00:44:18.849 --> 00:44:19.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: Oh, oh yeah, at the bottom of the ocean,
OK.

00:44:19.849 --> 00:44:20.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: It's sunk. Actually sunk.

00:44:20.849 --> 00:44:21.849
&gt;&gt;Tod: Actually--

00:44:21.849 --> 00:44:22.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: It's split in two and sunk now and
hopefully they'll be an Ady Gil II.

00:44:22.849 --> 00:44:23.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: OK.

00:44:23.849 --> 00:44:24.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: We hope so, but Sea Shepherd has
already announced that as long as there's

00:44:24.849 --> 00:44:25.849
a criminal whaling operation that we're gonna
go down there, so Sea Shepherd has already

00:44:25.849 --> 00:44:26.849
announced an operation of a compromise for
next year.

00:44:26.849 --> 00:44:27.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: Cool. Oh, have we got one here?

00:44:27.849 --> 00:44:28.849
&gt;&gt;man in audience4: Yeah, [clears throat]
I have a question. So do you ever wonder with

00:44:28.849 --> 00:44:29.849
all the sort of varied confrontational violent
form of protest you engage in, that you're

00:44:29.849 --> 00:44:30.849
actually hardening public opinion in Japan?
Because, at least in my perspective, I see

00:44:30.849 --> 00:44:31.849
you guys smashing up against boats, thousands
of miles from anybody else, boarding them,

00:44:31.849 --> 00:44:32.849
I would think, especially when it seems that
Norway--

00:44:32.849 --> 00:44:33.849
[audience member coughs]

00:44:33.849 --> 00:44:34.849
and Iceland are also hunting mink whales and
almost the same amount, that if I was in Japan,

00:44:34.849 --> 00:44:35.849
I would say, "OK, well these protesters are
just thugs out there having fun." Like, yet

00:44:35.849 --> 00:44:36.849
have you reconciled that with--

00:44:36.849 --> 00:44:37.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Sea, Sea Shepherd is not a violent
organization and going and saving a whale,

00:44:37.849 --> 00:44:38.849
which is a magnificent creature from being
harpooned and having the whale take 23 minutes

00:44:38.849 --> 00:44:39.849
to die, is, that's violence. That's violence
is harpooning a whale. Going and putting our

00:44:39.849 --> 00:44:40.849
ship in the way of that harpoon and blocking
that harpoon and if a ship gets damaged in

00:44:40.849 --> 00:44:41.849
the, in the process than so be it. But, to
us, our main priority is going down there

00:44:41.849 --> 00:44:42.849
and saving the whales.

00:44:42.849 --> 00:44:43.849
&gt;&gt;Tod: And, and in answer to your question
about the Japanese opinion, actually what's

00:44:43.849 --> 00:44:44.849
happening now with our campaign is that more
and more Japanese are now actually finding

00:44:44.849 --> 00:44:45.849
out for the first time that their country
is actually whaling. Because a lot of the

00:44:45.849 --> 00:44:46.849
country had no idea that it was even going
on before this happened. And actually, without

00:44:46.849 --> 00:44:47.849
Japanese support, we couldn't do a lot of
the things that we did. The only person under

00:44:47.849 --> 00:44:48.849
my command on the ship actually, was a Japanese
citizen, who did a lot of the, the research

00:44:48.849 --> 00:44:49.849
and translating for us. So, there is a lot
of support, but it's very hard, it's very,

00:44:49.849 --> 00:44:50.849
very difficult to be an environmentalist in
Japan. It's very difficult to go against the

00:44:50.849 --> 00:44:51.849
government program like this. So, a lot of
this has to be done very furtively, a lot

00:44:51.849 --> 00:44:52.849
of them help us out any way they can, but
a lot of it is very not public.

00:44:52.849 --> 00:44:53.849
&gt;&gt;man in audience4: I guess I meant to you,
so you continue to think that your methods

00:44:53.849 --> 00:44:54.849
are the best way to stop the whaling?

00:44:54.849 --> 00:44:55.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Our methods are stopping whaling,
both directly saving lives and economically.

00:44:55.849 --> 00:44:56.849
So, until--

00:44:56.849 --> 00:44:57.849
[audience member coughs]

00:44:57.849 --> 00:44:58.849
the governments of the world actually step
in to do something, because Sea Shepherd wouldn't

00:44:58.849 --> 00:44:59.849
be down there if the governments were actually
doing their jobs and going down there and

00:44:59.849 --> 00:45:00.849
enforcing international law. This is a whale
sanctuary and its very much an illegal, criminal

00:45:00.849 --> 00:45:01.849
whaling operation, so we would love to have
the governments come down there and drive

00:45:01.849 --> 00:45:02.849
the whalers out and then we wouldn't need
to go down there every year, but will continue

00:45:02.849 --> 00:45:03.849
to go down as long as there's an illegal whaling
operation.

00:45:03.849 --> 00:45:04.849
&gt;&gt;man in audience4: Illegal by which laws?

00:45:04.849 --> 00:45:05.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: It's, commercial whaling has been
outlawed by the International Whaling Commission.

00:45:05.849 --> 00:45:06.849
I mean, where all these whales are going is
actually right to people's plates and there,

00:45:06.849 --> 00:45:07.849
it's being sold for about 60 million dollars
worth of whale meat a year, which is a criminal

00:45:07.849 --> 00:45:08.849
whaling operation and it's also been designated
a whale sanctuary, so it's very much an illegal

00:45:08.849 --> 00:45:09.849
whaling operation.

00:45:09.849 --> 00:45:10.849
&gt;&gt;malemember4: And I read recently that Australia
is trying to take court action against Japan

00:45:10.849 --> 00:45:11.849
and that US and New Zealand have rejected
or have criticized that tactic. What are your

00:45:11.849 --> 00:45:12.849
thoughts on that?

00:45:12.849 --> 00:45:13.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Well, the Australian government
actually, one of their campaign promises a

00:45:13.849 --> 00:45:14.849
few years ago was that they were going to
take legal action over the illegal whaling.

00:45:14.849 --> 00:45:15.849
And so they're finally now following through
on that and they have sued Japan in International

00:45:15.849 --> 00:45:16.849
Court over their whaling, so I do commend
Australia for taking that action and following

00:45:16.849 --> 00:45:17.849
through on that campaign promise that they
said they were gonna do.

00:45:17.849 --> 00:45:18.849
[pause]

00:45:18.849 --> 00:45:19.849
&gt;&gt;man in audience4: Is that a better or worse
approach than throwing stink bombs?

00:45:19.849 --> 00:45:20.849
[laughter]

00:45:20.849 --> 00:45:21.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: His question was is that a better or
worse approach than throwing stink bombs?

00:45:21.849 --> 00:45:22.849
[laughter]

00:45:22.849 --> 00:45:23.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Sure. Well, we need different approaches
and on one hand we need the media, we need

00:45:23.849 --> 00:45:24.849
to down there, save live and protect the whales,
but we also need international law being enforced.

00:45:24.849 --> 00:45:25.849
So, we need to have both.

00:45:25.849 --> 00:45:26.849
&gt;&gt;man in audience4: Sorry, what did you need?
We need the media?

00:45:26.849 --> 00:45:27.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: No, we need both approaches. We
need international law to be enforced and

00:45:27.849 --> 00:45:28.849
we also need the direct action of going down
there and saving lives and protecting the

00:45:28.849 --> 00:45:29.849
whales.

00:45:29.849 --> 00:45:30.849
[pause]

00:45:30.849 --> 00:45:31.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: Sir.

00:45:31.849 --> 00:45:32.849
&gt;&gt;man in audience5: Is that question that
comes up for me is then who is, you said that

00:45:32.849 --> 00:45:33.849
governments aren't taking any action and whatnot,
so who is, on the planet, taking action? What

00:45:33.849 --> 00:45:34.849
groups who are enforcing the moratorium on
whaling.

00:45:34.849 --> 00:45:35.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: It's, it's really not being enforced
right now and that's why Sea Shepherd is the

00:45:35.849 --> 00:45:36.849
one organization that's going down there to
enforce that moratorium. And it's just, it's

00:45:36.849 --> 00:45:37.849
always up to individuals and it's just individuals
who go out and decide they're gonna do good

00:45:37.849 --> 00:45:38.849
things and save lives or maybe just change
their consumer habits. And say, next time

00:45:38.849 --> 00:45:39.849
you go out and do take a bag with you and
you make sure you take your coffee mug or

00:45:39.849 --> 00:45:40.849
water bottle, so that plastic bag that you
were gonna bring your lunch home in, it doesn't

00:45:40.849 --> 00:45:41.849
somehow end up being eaten by a leatherback
turtle. And, and it's really just up to the

00:45:41.849 --> 00:45:42.849
individuals.

00:45:42.849 --> 00:45:43.849
&gt;&gt;Tod: Yeah, we can't really emphasize that
enough that it's really up to the consumer

00:45:43.849 --> 00:45:44.849
has, the consumer has so much power here.
When you go to the Galapagos, which are, is

00:45:44.849 --> 00:45:45.849
isolated, highly protected islands in the
middle of the ocean, you have trash lining

00:45:45.849 --> 00:45:46.849
up all over the beaches and this trash is
coming from all the way from Chile. There's

00:45:46.849 --> 00:45:47.849
trash lining all the oceans, covering the
oceans that far away from the mainland where

00:45:47.849 --> 00:45:48.849
they're being dropped into the water. We've
taken out all the fish and we've literally

00:45:48.849 --> 00:45:49.849
replaced it with plastic. It's a global catastrophe,
but it's not being caused because of volcanoes

00:45:49.849 --> 00:45:50.849
or because of meteors. It's the most avoidable
catastrophe we could be faced with. And it's

00:45:50.849 --> 00:45:51.849
all because of our consumer habits. And if
we change that, then we can eliminate the

00:45:51.849 --> 00:45:52.849
problem just by changing what we buy.

00:45:52.849 --> 00:45:53.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: So, so, as, we're talking about enforcement
and--

00:45:53.849 --> 00:45:54.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Mm-hmm.

00:45:54.849 --> 00:45:55.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: you guys being the only, I guess, people
actually seeing if there's any illegal activities

00:45:55.849 --> 00:45:56.849
going on, cause there's very little surveillance
I guess in the ocean. You think there might

00:45:56.849 --> 00:45:57.849
be some kind of satellite surveillance at
least tracking of vessels--

00:45:57.849 --> 00:45:58.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Mm-hmm.

00:45:58.849 --> 00:45:59.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: if there's an unauthorized vessel--

00:45:59.849 --> 00:46:00.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Mm-hmm.

00:46:00.849 --> 00:46:01.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: in the unauthorized area that might
be something? Or that information might help

00:46:01.849 --> 00:46:02.849
track--

00:46:02.849 --> 00:46:03.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Mm-hmm.

00:46:03.849 --> 00:46:04.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: or reduce the amount of illegal fishing?

00:46:04.849 --> 00:46:05.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Sure. Using technology in missile
tracking is a really easy way for governments

00:46:05.849 --> 00:46:06.849
to enforce laws. And actually, the national
park in the Galapagos is already doing that.

00:46:06.849 --> 00:46:07.849
And last year they implemented a vessel monitoring
system for the Galapagos Marine Reserve and

00:46:07.849 --> 00:46:08.849
they actually caught a tuna ship illegally
catching tuna in their waters because they

00:46:08.849 --> 00:46:09.849
noticed it on their vessel monitoring system.
So it is one really great way for governments--

00:46:09.849 --> 00:46:10.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: Do you know what kind of technology,
then? Is it satellite based? Is it some kind

00:46:10.849 --> 00:46:11.849
of proximity from? I guess Galapagos is small
relative to the entire planet. But that's

00:46:11.849 --> 00:46:12.849
cool that they're utilizing that kind of information.
Anybody else? Sure.

00:46:12.849 --> 00:46:13.849
&gt;&gt;man in audience6: Why is there such a lack
of concern on the governments to get involved?

00:46:13.849 --> 00:46:14.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: It comes down to money. It comes
down to money.

00:46:14.849 --> 00:46:15.849
&gt;&gt;man in audience6: It's expensive to track
these--

00:46:15.849 --> 00:46:16.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: It's not even, it's not even, it's
a lot more expensive to have all the fish

00:46:16.849 --> 00:46:17.849
depleted from the oceans than have fisheries
collapsing all over the world, but the, but

00:46:17.849 --> 00:46:18.849
most of media concern is that there's just
not the political will, because consumers

00:46:18.849 --> 00:46:19.849
want to have whatever fish they want and then
people who are in the fishing industry have

00:46:19.849 --> 00:46:20.849
a very strong political lobby.

00:46:20.849 --> 00:46:21.849
&gt;&gt;man in audience6: So, demand for it.

00:46:21.849 --> 00:46:22.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Yeah.

00:46:22.849 --> 00:46:23.849
&gt;&gt;man in audience6: And if I could just switch
topics for a little bit.

00:46:23.849 --> 00:46:24.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Sure.

00:46:24.849 --> 00:46:25.849
&gt;&gt;malemember6: This whole BP oil mess, how
far reaching do you think that's gonna be?

00:46:25.849 --> 00:46:26.849
I mean, I keep hearing on the news how it's
the United States problem, but I can't see

00:46:26.849 --> 00:46:27.849
this stopping anywhere soon.

00:46:27.849 --> 00:46:28.849
&gt;&gt;Tod: Our crew has been down there actually,
and we've been monitoring independently of

00:46:28.849 --> 00:46:29.849
BP, how bad it's going to be and, and trying
to formulate a better plan in order to help

00:46:29.849 --> 00:46:30.849
clean it up and organize more ships to do
it. And right now, it's staggering how much

00:46:30.849 --> 00:46:31.849
we don't know because of how little access
anyone's allowed there right now. And so the

00:46:31.849 --> 00:46:32.849
first step is going to be to assess how bad
it's going to be and right now it's looking

00:46:32.849 --> 00:46:33.849
worse than what anyone's dreaming about.

00:46:33.849 --> 00:46:34.849
&gt;&gt;malemember6: It's got to be a global effect.

00:46:34.849 --> 00:46:35.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Mm-hmm.

00:46:35.849 --> 00:46:36.849
&gt;&gt;Tod: Yes. Most definitely.

00:46:36.849 --> 00:46:37.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: Well, it's one ocean effectively, too.
So, it's all gonna get mixed together.

00:46:37.849 --> 00:46:38.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: It is one ocean, but Pacific Islanders
have a saying that the oceans are not what

00:46:38.849 --> 00:46:39.849
divides us but what connects us. And I think
events like the Gulf oil spill are really

00:46:39.849 --> 00:46:40.849
gonna illustrate that for people, but.

00:46:40.849 --> 00:46:41.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: What was the, cause I took a tour of
the Steve Irwin when it was docked in the

00:46:41.849 --> 00:46:42.849
Hudson River. And met Tod and he was giving
the tour and he mentioned that there was a

00:46:42.849 --> 00:46:43.849
statue given to Sea Shepherd from the Dalai
Lama, is that right?

00:46:43.849 --> 00:46:44.849
&gt;&gt;Tod: Yes.

00:46:44.849 --> 00:46:45.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: Can you tell me about what statue he
gave you guys?

00:46:45.849 --> 00:46:46.849
&gt;&gt;Tod: Yes. He gave us a little statue and
it represented the Tibetan demon of Wrathful

00:46:46.849 --> 00:46:47.849
Compassion. And he said that, the Dalai Lama
is one of our supporters, he said that the

00:46:47.849 --> 00:46:48.849
demon represents the fact that you can teach
people how to be compassionate, you can tell

00:46:48.849 --> 00:46:49.849
them all the reasons why they shouldn't kill
lives and shouldn't cause suffering, but if

00:46:49.849 --> 00:46:50.849
you tell them everything, you teach them everything
and they still go out and they still start

00:46:50.849 --> 00:46:51.849
killing people. Sometimes you just have to
scare the hell out of them--

00:46:51.849 --> 00:46:52.849
[laughter]

00:46:52.849 --> 00:46:53.849
to stop doing it. And he said that we represented
that Tibetan demon and so he gave us that

00:46:53.849 --> 00:46:54.849
statue, so, as, as to commemorate our place
as, as our job.

00:46:54.849 --> 00:46:55.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: And I think that was really cool. That
was really cool. So, thank you guys for coming.

00:46:55.849 --> 00:46:56.849
It was a great discussion, thank you guys
for coming and look forward to seeing the

00:46:56.849 --> 00:46:57.849
show tomorrow.

00:46:57.849 --> 00:46:58.849
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Well great. Thanks so much for having
us; it was really our pleasure to be here

00:46:58.849 --> 00:46:59.849
today.

00:46:59.849 --> 00:47:00.849
&gt;&gt;Lee: Cool. Thanks guys.

00:47:00.849 --> 00:47:00.850
[applause]
