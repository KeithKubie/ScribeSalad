Oh!

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.440
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic! I remember it so you don't have to!

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.680
Ok, I am excited.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.540
I am so VERY excited!

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.680
Today, we get to review the Alvin and the Chipmunks Movie!

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.920
Oh my God, I love this film!

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.440
With its hair-raising adventures, singing new songs along with old ones,

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.340
and traveling the WORLD while escaping danger at every turn!

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.720
It's strange, because I swear I reviewed this film before in a cross-over...

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.460
but that doesn't matter! We are looking at it today

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.040
in all its glory, and I AM PSYCHED!

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.580
My friends and I haven't seen this movie in YEARS!

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.460
..wait, why aren't you wearing green?

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.520
Jim: I'm colorblind...

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.460
NC: Oh well, who cares. Let's get ready for this AWESOME Chipmunk adventure!

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.360
*pop music*

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.760
All 3: Awww!

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.400
Scallon: The shitty CGI one.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.480
NC: Christ, is THIS what people think of when they hear "The Chipmunks Movie"?

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.360
Analyst 2: Yes

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.020
ALL: ahh

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.540
Analyst 1: with the movie making nut loads of money at the box office, we have cemented ourselves as the only REAL chipmunks franchise

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.340
Scallon: How are you able to keep making these films?

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.560
Jim: Yeah, We know kids would watch anything but who's taking them to go see it?

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.580
Critic: Or even creepier watching it themselves?

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.220
Analyst 2: Simple, a demographic that never lets us down.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.480
The AW Girls.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.840
The "AW Girls"?

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.660
Analyst 1: Women and Teens who would watch anything simply to say "AWWWWWW"

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.800
Aw Girls: AWWWWWW!!!!!!

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.800
Critic: Dammit, Your love of cuteness is ruining a perfectly good franchise!

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.420
Aw Girl 2: But they're just so adorable...

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.620
Aw Girl 1: We're not here to "analyze story".

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.340
Aw Girl 3: We just want to look at cute little animals do cute little things.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.900
Aw Girl 2:  Ohhhh! I just want to pinch their cheeks!

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.040
Aw Girls: [cutesy cuddling noises]

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.280
NC: You ladies are ruining the dignity of a GREAT adventure series!

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.580
Aw Girl 2: Oh, really?

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.780
Aw Girl 3: Isn't your movie about chipmunks who operate balloons for diamond smuggling?

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.200
NC: It made A LOT OF SENSE in the 80's!

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.940
NC: More than Eleanor not wearing green!

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.820
Aw Girl 3: Hey, I'm color-blind, okay?

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:15.460
Jim: What?

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.700
Jim: Me too...

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.180
[Falling In Love Music]

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.080
NC: Enough of that!

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.780
Aw Girl 2: Look...

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.860
Aw Girl 2: Our movie makes a lot more sense, and that's final.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.000
NC: Okay, if we can prove that your movie is bullshit...

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.960
NC: Will you acknowledge that ours is better?

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.820
Aw Girl 1: No.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.200
NC: Oh...

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.640
NC: W-wellll I...

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.520
NC: Guess I'll just...review the movie then.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.580
Aw Girl 2: You do that.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.980
Jim: I kinda thought that this was going to lead to an ongoing debate.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.960
NC: Yeah, like they had comedic identities that we can work off of...

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.000
NC: No...

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:53.280
*Pop*

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.920
NC: Well I...

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.740
NC: ...guess I'll just call you two if I need a musical number.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.660
Scallon: Seems fair.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.520
NC: Bye.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.580
NC: Umm.....

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.200
NC: Here's the review.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.240
NC: The film opens with the Chipmunks in a tree

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.780
singing the song "You Had A Bad Day".

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.400
NC: A perfect tune to foreshadow the next hour and a half.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.280
Hey, don't waste time developing characters...

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.940
and instead, cut down their house and take it to a building in L.A.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.200
There, a songwriter named Dave, played by Jason 'I'm still gonna say 'Mallrats' was my biggest letdown' Lee...

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.420
is late for an audition.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.300
He meets up with his neighbor and pro-takes in...

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.440
at least one of 'The Top 5 Worst Expositions Scenes Ever'.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.680
Let me guess, you're late for something again.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.720
Same ol' Dave.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.920
Not following you.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.480
Guy who always fooling around...

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.400
you can't handle a serious relationship...

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.940
NC: You know, why don't you just turn to the camera and say...

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.540
"Hi audience, I'm Dave. If you look under your seat, you'll see a trading card with my stats on it."

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.900
"I know it's an awkward way to introduce you to who I am, but trust me, it's much less awkward than if we tried working it in the story."

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.040
"We're not really good at that 'talking like humans' thing."

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.160
But they sure are good at ruining David Cross' career though...

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.640
Hey, back off man!

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.980
This is Dave Seville.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.680
I'm still on every years 'worst movie list'.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.040
Actually, to his credit, David Cross is one of the few genuinely funny things in this movie.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.500
He plays a music producer who clearly doesn't give a shit that he's in a 'Chipmunks' movie.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.240
So he gets this delightfully passive-aggressive performance.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.920
You know what? Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave is NOT here!

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.960
I had a nightmare.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.500
Aww....

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.060
If they can make a doll out of this guy, I would totally buy it!

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.800
We're 'THE CHIPMUNKS' for crying out loud!

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.320
He's, sadly though, is not a fan of Dave's songwriting.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.120
The original inspiration came to me...

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.000
Song sucks, dave.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.500
What?

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.440
Your song?

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.560
It's awful.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:47.420
I hate it.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.760
Have you tried speeding it up so it sounds like hi-pitched ear penetration?

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.180
I need something new. I need something fresh..

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.940
That..that is...

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:55.980
The next big thing.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.440
I need Christmas and hula-hoops!

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.200
But Dave shows them by stealing their muffins!

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.100
Hey!

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.460
Yes, that scene definitely needed 'thrilling muffin stealing' music.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.660
Why don't you just play 'A Latin Choir' when The Chipmunks sneak into it?

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.020
Look out! Raspberry!

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.920
He then proceeds to throw out the muffins...

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:22.940
What the fuck's wrong with you?

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:23.840
Those look delicious.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.320
And decides to throw out all of his music equipment, too.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.500
Take that, free money.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.160
Ebay will have none of you.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.700
But don't worry, he can make all that cash back...

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.100
through these product placements.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.920
This is the greatest...

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.060
day of my life!

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.740
We can get a lot of cute B roll footage with these!

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.400
Cannonball!

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.720
Awwww....

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.100
Hey, I thought you said you weren't debating.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.620
We're not. We're aweing.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:51.960
It's cute.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.220
Don't you have a cat video to share or something?

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.960
We don't need to.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.580
We consumed so much cute, that it's literally in our bodies.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.860
Hey look! I coughed another one!

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.140
Awwww....

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.360
I need to stay away from you.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.920
Dave tries to see what's going on, but apprently Alvin's fuckin blood-hungry.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.220
Betcha didn't know this was the 'R' rated version.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.600
Dave: Oh gosh, stay away from my nuts...

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.100
As much as we wished that would have happen, it doesn't.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.100
But, he does fart in his face.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.460
It's funny because it came from his butt.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.000
They finally knock him out and tried to figure what to do with him.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.180
I need three garbage bags, a shovel, some disinfectant, some latex gloves, and oregano.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.120
I don't like how quickly he come up with that!

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.060
Theodore, I can't go back to prison.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.140
Why did you have to kill that prostitute before Alvin?

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.720
She wasn;t a prostitute, she was an escort.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.440
BIG DIFFERENCE!

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.320
But Dave gets up and they introduce themselves.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.180
I'm Simon, the smart one.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.340
He's Alvin.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.700
The awesomest one.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.480
And I'm Theodore.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:58.960
Oh, nice to meet you.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.460
I guess Theodore doesn't have any personality traits.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.740
He fell out of the tree at birth.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.500
Outside of buck per-verbal abuse.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:05.980
We talk.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.140
It's creepy.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.160
Unnatural.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:09.500
Somewhat evil.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.780
Hey, it's the critical praises for the front of the box.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.480
So Dave, being the remarkably unlikable character that he is...

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.200
throws the cute little chipmunks out into the rain.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.280
Now where's that puppy I wanted to hit with the handle of my gun?

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.840
But his heart softens when he realizes...

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.460
he can make a quick buck off of them.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.820
You guys can sing too?

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.500
This is amazing.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.080
The talking didn't mean shit.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.320
But now that you can sing, you're of worth.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:35.860
Here's the deal.

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.820
You guys sing my songs, you get to sleep here.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.100
Usually in the music industry, it's the other way around.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.980
You sleep here, you get to sing my songs.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.680
I don't want to come home and find a bunch of rabbits and skunks on my couch.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.900
Filthy creatures, Dave.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.120
Never associate with them.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.360
Wow, animal racist much?

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.520
We need to build a wall, Dave!

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:57.920
Oh, by the way with them being kids,

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.660
you ever wonder where their parents are?

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.180
Our parents were hippies.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:02.920
They left early to join a commune.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:04.960
Explained.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.140
So while thinking a song to be their outlet,

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.020
the chipmunks start humming in their sleep.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:19.400
♪ One...a plane...that loops-the-loop...♪

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:24.480
Yeah, pretty sad when animals snoring can write a better melody than you can.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.340
Listen, I think I can hear my dog vomiting...

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.120
&lt;blech&gt;

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.600
OPERA!

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.260
This inspires him to write a song,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.340
but not before realizing Simon's vision might be a little off.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:38.200
Try these.

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:43.860
Wow, thank God the makers of plastic Santas thought their toy was nearsighted

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.400
so gave them all Simon's prescription.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.520
That was a...

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.460
magical kind of dumb.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.320
We're gonna have food all winter.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.640
So, if you start storing it, it's gonna get gross,

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.260
and...we're gonna have rodent...

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.920
NC: That's our word, dickslice.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.140
Dave: non-talking...

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:00.580
rodents.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.920
So they try singing the famous Christmas song

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.600
and we get to hear Dave's famous scream of 'ALVIN!'

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.000
This kicks the hamster's wheel's butt.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.740
ALVIN!

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.700
Well, that was superbly half-assed.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.640
It's one of the famous trademarks of The Chipmunks

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.560
and than there's just...

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.140
no effort to it.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:22.940
In fact, everytime he says it, he sounds less and less angry,

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.060
and more like the kid from 'Troll 2'.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.560
ALVIN!

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:32.240
OH MY GOD!!!!!!

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.380
Well, then again, what did you expect

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.920
when his voice is beyond hoarse in this movie?

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.040
Oh, you're sorry?

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.080
That's fantastic.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.780
If you fled my house, you're dead.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.420
Go away, leave me alone.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.100
He sounds like Bob Dylan,

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.920
if he's been gargling cactus covered in sandpaper.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.440
My house's always a mess.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.200
Or I'll call the exterminator.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.020
Don't go, I can explain.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.220
Maybe his voice got tired from going home

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.960
after every shoot and screaming into his pillow.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:00.080
Arrgh, I can't believe I'm in this shit. I can't believe I'm in this shit...

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.260
What?

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.660
Um, Mr. Cross, you're in the movie.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:06.880
Action.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:11.180
Get this, Dave tried to show off the singing vermin,

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.480
but apparently, they get stage fright.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:17.920
Because if there's any characteristics I associate with Alvin,

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.400
it's stage fright.

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:20.820
But it's okay,

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.840
because they get him fired from his job at an advertising firm.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.700
Well not because they drew Theodore's butt on his charts,

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.580
but because they spell have the 'S's backwards and the other half forward.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:31.480
Who does that?

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.320
Would you choose one or the other? You wouldn't go back and forth.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.160
I'll think I'll just clean out my office.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.000
Sounds good.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.340
I'm sure glad we paid the extra money for Jane Lynch in that role.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.100
Though, to be fair, that is a very sexy chart.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:45.540
GET OUT OF HERE!

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.080
Things seem even worse at home.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.600
Theodore, did you just...

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.780
It's a raisin, Dave.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:51.640
Prove it.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.100
Where's Alvin?

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:55.740
Dave: Alvin.

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.440
You owe me big time.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.140
Chipmunks eating shit.

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.740
That's what I wanted to see.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:01.760
Isn't it you want to see?

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.900
I paid good money to see Alvin and the Chipmunks

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:05.600
eating shi...

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.340
What's going on in 'the other film' right now?

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:11.320
Oh look at that, the Chipettes are battling sharks in Bermuda

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.940
and the Chipmunks are almost eaten alive by crocodiles.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.580
What do we got in this movie?

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:17.120
Chipmunks eating shit.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.400
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.780
You know, maybe marketing wanted to train kids into eating crap

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:24.600
before actually selling it to them.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.040
The funny thing is, in the trailer, it shows Alvin who eats the turd

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.280
instead of Simon.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.980
That means Alvin must've been so pissed off at this scene

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.300
that he refused to have it in the movie.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.500
Fuck you guys. No fuck you guys all to hell.

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.920
You want me, the star of the movie, to eat shit for you?

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.180
What the fuck is wrong with you?

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.900
You can take this 'Two Girls, One Cup' bullcrap

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:44.920
and shove it up your ass.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.240
You hear me? Up your ass

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.960
where it belongs, not in my mouth.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.580
No, no, you already tricked me into doing it for the trailer

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:51.600
you sick bastards.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.160
But I thought that really was 'a raisin'.

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:54.140
You lied to me.

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:55.020
You LIED to me!

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:56.700
You can ask my dick if I care,

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:57.740
because I don't.

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.500
Kiss my ass in hell, you pathetic twat.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:02.500
Okay, Simon you're up.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.160
I don't know if I'm comfortable with this...

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:04.660
OW!

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.580
You don't get paid as much as Alvin.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.480
You want to see what I can 'really' do to you?

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.700
Probably eating shit from you, sir.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.600
But Dave's neighbor calls about her date.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.620
Hi Dave, it's Clair Wilson calling.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:15.700
And, oh...

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.800
why did I just say my last name?

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:18.980
That was weird.

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:21.740
Um, I guess I'm just a little nervous about

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:22.800
coming over for dinner.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.560
I'll be there at 7

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.480
uh, kay. Bye.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:30.340
Wow....even for a literally a phoned-in line,

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:33.140
that was REALLY a phoned-in line.

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:35.800
The only thing sounding less interested than her on the phone

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:36.840
is her in real life.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.180
Please, I'm begging you.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.680
No games, no fooling around.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.300
No acting either.

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:47.060
I wanna stay out of the 'Squeakquels' as much as possible.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.680
My life is being sabotaged by talking chipmunks.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.120
Off-camera: Uh, Mr. Lee, that's not in the script.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.180
NC: I know, I'm just making a declaration.

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.220
Feeling bad, the chipmunks convinced the producer

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.380
that he drop acid as that's that he only

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:04.180
way he agree to sign them to a record recording deal

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:05.480
as opposed to...

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.800
donate them to science.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.620
That video of your little guys?

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.800
10 million hits already on Youtube.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.180
It's blowing up bigger

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:13.520
than that 'Jem' twat.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.180
So the chipmunks start recording albums

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.160
and make Dave all sorts of money.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.680
It's a shame money can't buy love, though...

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.340
at least,

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.480
not a butthole like Dave's love.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.860
Make sure we understand each other.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:40.960
I'm not your...

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.040
dad or anything.

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:43.340
You're like a dad.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.200
Well, not really.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.720
I'm more of 'a piss on a child's heart' kind of person.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.940
The kind that the plot that should be your father,

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:52.280
but anyone with a brain is like

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.980
he's an insensitive asshole.

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.700
They go and perform 'Witch Doctor' in front of

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.140
a clearly paid to look interested crowd.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.580
Yeah, I can fake having fun to this...

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.160
As the film continues to show,

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.480
that it doesn't need a 'Witch Doctor'

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.520
as much as a script doctor.

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:09.660
I'm covering your rise to fame.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:11.300
I'm sorry about that night.

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:12.900
I really, really thought that...

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:13.940
I was insane?

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.160
I didn't know you're gonna be famous.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.360
I totally would've put up with all the non-commitment stuff I talked about earlier

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.480
if I knew that.

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.380
And it looks like Dave

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.800
is STILL okay with being a douche.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:26.760
You're like a family.

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:28.600
He doesn't want a family.

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.280
You know, why don't you guys out and play

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.840
or raid the dessert table or something?

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.600
I'm still not convinced you're not a leftover high

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.620
for 'My Name is Earl'

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:37.800
I can't love when I don't know it's really there.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.900
But, Cross is excited to get the merchandise going.

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.080
It's Alvin.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.060
That looks nothing like Alvin.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.780
Well then, it's a perfect toy to represent the movie.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.340
You got to expand the 'Munks fanbase.

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:50.720
Forget about the music.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.760
The music is...

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.920
a lot of means to the BIG money.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:59.920
Okay, if we can put away a nickel every time a movie says being an advertising sellout is bad,

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.160
while being an advertising sellout,

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.940
we can feed all the people in the world...

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.000
TWICE!

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:08.940
So Cross looks at them in the eye

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.620
and tells them that they all be better off with him.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:12.660
At least he

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.300
tries looking at them in the eye.

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:15.360
He's over there, Cross.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:15.920
He's over there...

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:16.580
look down,

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:17.220
look down, Cross.

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:17.900
No, to your left.

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:18.640
To your left.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:19.360
Was there a...

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.540
shortage of sticks with tennis balls on them?

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.560
Dave's holding you back.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:26.400
You know, I can make you twenty large a day.

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:27.660
You guys will be so big

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.160
that one day we'll go off against Star Wars!

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.380
Yeah, and beat them really. Yeah. Yeah.

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:36.360
So Cross gives them everything they always wanted,

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.700
including an attractive housemaid.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.040
She's also a masseuse.

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:40.660
(tiger growls)

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.560
Okay, first of all, kid.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.920
Second of all, chipmunk.

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:44.560
Third of all,

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.560
I don't want to think a kid chipmunk getting

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.640
'A Happy Ending'.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.580
I know that's just techincally combining the first two,

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:50.880
but it's SUCH A BIG ONE

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.560
I THOUGHT THAT IT DESERVES REPEATING!

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:55.900
Causing Dave to even more acting like duckshit.

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.400
Well Uncle Ian says we're like his family.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.580
Well if you love Uncle Ian so much,

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:02.740
and you don't think I'm watching out for you,

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:04.480
why don't you just go a live with Uncle Ian?

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:05.780
So they go and live with Uncle Ian.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.560
I told you Dave.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:09.360
I never lose.

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:10.820
Wait till you see the ways

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:12.420
I tried to sabotage 'Chipwrecked'.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:14.840
Cue in that TV is B roll footage.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:26.260
&lt;Aw Girls fan-screaming&gt;

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:30.240
Okay, in 'the other film', they'd be singing in the ruins of Rome.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.480
Not stealing whatever tune is popular at the time,

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.720
but instead singing a new rockin' song.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.080
How is THIS any better?

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.500
You don't understand.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.300
Cute anything in a toy monster truck

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.780
equals three adorables and one precious.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.220
Wait, there's a formula to this?

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.760
Uggh, stay out of this, Michael Bay!

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:47.700
Oh, I've been targeting the wrong demographic.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.020
I should have been making kids films this whole time.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.480
You made 'Transformers'. Those are kids films.

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:55.160
Oh, no, no, no, that was my most adult work.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.460
Deep Wang is very symbolic.

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:59.780
But, I really want to take a crack at this Chipmunk formula.

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:00.460
Let's see.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.800
All three of them blow up.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.060
&lt;gasp&gt;

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.660
Oh dear, I'm not very good at this.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.480
But Dave realizes he misses the plot,

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:13.000
and should probably admit that he was a horse's taint the whole time.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.380
Which is good because Cross' was almost gonna send The Chipmunks on an extra long tour of Europe.

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:21.320
Oh no, that'd be awful. I dare even say...

00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:23.040
entertaining.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:24.780
But on top of that,

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:27.360
it looks like their voices are giving up from being worked too hard.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:29.980
You three sound like you've been gargling nails.

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.000
Hey, don't talk about Jason Lee that way.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.860
So he recommends that they 'pull a Milli Vanilli'

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:35.840
lip-sync

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:37.380
Isn't that like cheating?

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:38.200
No, it's not

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.760
like...cheating.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.020
This is more like helping.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.860
It's like buying the rights to a song, speeding it up, and then selling it to you again.

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.240
Totally not cheating...

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:49.260
But Dave tries to sneak in and call to them.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.700
Alvin.

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.220
ALvin.

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:53.640
ALVIN!

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:56.920
I heard that faint yell not really louder than that last faint yell.

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.440
Alvin, what are you doing?

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.740
Wow, wardrobe malfunction!

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:03.180
Cover those with that Janet Jackson nipples, would you?

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:04.200
Show some shame.

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:05.420
C'mon guys!

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.040
So The Chipmunks decide to sabotage the concert.

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:13.140
C'mon, let's put all these singers and dancers out of a job.

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.800
That'll show the guy who already has a ton of money.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.940
Unemployment line is that way, poor musicians.

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:19.440
GET THEM!

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.740
But, apparently kidnapping the talent is legal now.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:25.700
As Cross throws them at a cage a plans to still send them on their tour.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:28.680
I'm sure this camera tilt down to the dolls means nothing.

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.300
They'd just ruined the concert.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:31.620
No one will come to see them.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:32.680
Dave,

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.040
they're chipmunks...who talk.

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.160
People will come.

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.880
Isn't that what the producers say every time they pitch a sequel?

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.740
So they get to their vehicles and partake in a thrilling climax.

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.080
Step on it, Dave.

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.560
Or...they wanted to just end this as quickly as we do.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.880
Of...course I came back. We're a family.

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:52.940
Uh, am I going crazy or he just said family.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:54.060
I know.

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:56.160
You guilt trip me into saying it

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.860
just like a real functioning unit.

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.120
I really missed you guys.

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.400
I missed you too, Dave.

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:02.540
So did Alvin.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.640
He's just...too cool to admit it.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.900
Yeah, too macho.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:13.540
Yeah, because that's the personality trait that clearly got from him:

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:14.900
Macho

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:19.380
In fact, I just realized, from a movie called 'Alvin and The Chipmunks',

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:22.140
Alvin has little to no personality.

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:26.440
Which is strange because he was always the biggest personality out of all of them.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:31.700
He was egotistical, a schemer, delusional that he was the best, even though he has a good heart.

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.400
This one was apparently...

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:34.820
macho.

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:36.060
As...

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.800
macho as this piece of paper.

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.060
Is which I'm suddenly decided to call macho. So that it automatically makes it macho.

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:42.860
You stay out of this, macho piece of paper.

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:43.920
You're too macho.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.500
That's so something he would say.

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:52.260
So they drive home in Dave's poor car reflective in his humble income

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:57.180
to his gigantic Ikea house worthy of any home furnishing magazine.

00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:59.240
Where Alvin, again, screws up.

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.440
Ha, ha, oops.

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:04.700
Not gonna say it.

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:08.040
Please do, the credits are right around the corner.

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:10.500
Still not gonna say it?

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:12.040
Nope.

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.960
You are holding us hostage until you do.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.520
Please say the thing YOU'RE NOT EVEN REALLY GOOD AT SAYING!

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:21.800
I'm gonna say it.

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.440
ALVIN!

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.560
I'm gone before you could even finish it.

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:29.900
So yeah, this movie's pretty bad.

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.160
Is it the worst?

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.580
No, the chipmunks are pretty cute and you get a laugh sometimes.

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:37.260
But they just needed to be in a better script.

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.260
This is every dumb Rock Star story for kids

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:43.840
that they, for some reason, think kids never catch on to.

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:44.340
And...

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.220
judging by how many sequels they made, maybe they're right.

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.340
But kids deserve better stories

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:50.360
and characters

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:54.180
and time devoted to give them something creative and exciting.

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:58.680
This is just a bland mesh compared to what we could have got.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:02.180
And I'm sorry, the original Chipmunks movie is still so much better.

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:07.700
It's exciting, weird, funny, visually interesting, has original songs in it,

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:12.380
and it's fun travelling the world and giving kids an adventure.

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.460
This is just 'Jem' with three hairy testicles.

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:15.980
YEAH!

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:19.220
Whatever, your movie makes no sense. And incredibly dated.

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:20.780
Holds up better than your piece of crap.

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:25.200
Oh yeah? What, you wanna bet that we can out chipmunk movie you?

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.100
Oh no. If they find out our films are inferior,

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:35.780
our 'Squekquels' will be demolished!

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:37.480
To the ruins of franchises.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.380
Hey, could you give me some advice in that kids' movie formula?

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:53.380
~Some folks frown, or even throw up~

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:56.120
~At which Chipmunks Movie that I like~

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:59.780
~Ready to bash their little brains with a club~

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:02.780
~Gonna whore my film tonight~

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:09.100
~You're living in the past world, you dinosaurs~

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:12.880
~You're more dated than a calendar~

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:17.520
~Your films don't mean dick anymore now~

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:21.160
~'Cause we're the REAL Chipmunks Movie!~

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:23.880
Where's your sequels?

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.680
~Y'know our films are goddamn money trees~

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:31.660
Go wear your dresses in the 1980's!

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.040
Whoaoaoa Yeah!

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.720
~Cated to your Adam Sandler watchers~

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:41.220
~You're used to shut up kids folks can't stand~

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.200
~We'd rather be corny, but imaginative~

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.080
~Than a literal shit-eating band~

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:54.080
~What we have is adventure that's creative~

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.340
~Your CGI sucks balls~

00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:58.620
Lots of balls!

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:02.660
~You can't count all the shits we give now~

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:06.560
~'Cause we're the REAL Chimpunks Movie~

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.700
You're written by jackasses looking for a check!

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.820
~All you got is a bored Jason Lee~

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.720
Keep acting like kids are dummies!

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.560
~Our business deals~

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.820
~with Happy Meals~

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:26.980
~Make us the REAL Chipmunks Movie!~

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:29.180
~Songs we don't steal~

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:30.220
~with mass appeal~

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:33.500
~Make us the REAL Chipmunks Movie~

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:01.240
*boom*

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:04.500
~'Cause we're the REAL Chipmunks Movie!~

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.760
~NooooOOoOoO!~

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:11.220
~Yeah, we're the REAL Chipmunk Movie!~

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:14.160
~Do you even know how tall Chiipmunks are?!~

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.580
~Yeah, we're the REAL Chipmunks Movie!~

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.920
GO DO A CROSSOVER WITH THE SMURFS!

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:24.220
~Yeah we're the REAL Chipmunks Movie!~

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:27.120
Lick my god damn ass!

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:30.580
~Yeah we're the REAL Chipmunks Movie!~

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.440
FUUUUUUCK YOU!

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:36.960
~Yeah we're the REAL Chipmunks Movie!~

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:39.200
Analyst 1: Well that in no way determined anything...

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.840
Analyst 2: Yes, for such a competitive song

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.260
nothing was really accomplished.

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.700
Didn't he do something like this before?

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.580
Did somebody said about doing stuff before?

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:51.540
How come we never talk?

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:56.020
CHIPMUNKS MOVIE!!!!!

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:51.760
You know what? Dave, Dave, Dave is not here.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.940
Hey guys, Doug Walker here doing the charity shout-out.

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:59.100
And this week we're doing 'Petsmart Charities'

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:03.460
This is a non-profit organization helping saved homeless pets.

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:08.240
As the leading funder of animal welfare organizations across North America,

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:13.480
they help save over 6.7 million pets and counting through adoption.

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:17.920
As well as increased spay and neuter services reducing pet overpopulation

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:24.240
and joined forces with over 3000 animal welfare organizations to help save as many lives a possible.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:28.620
Their goal is to find a lifelong loving home for every pet.

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:34.580
Finding more than 400,000 pets every year, with millions of pets still in needs of homes,

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:37.920
they continue to find new ways to reduce the homeless population.

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.600
If you check out their website or their Youtube channel,

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:44.680
you can see all the love and caring that you can help these people continue with.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:49.880
So many animals need our help that we can do our part to make sure they are kept safe.

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:52.940
