So the way to submit this answer on the forum,

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.470
is to look under the Discussions section of the web

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.000
page. For now, there is just the one link here.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.840
Although, you may see multiple links under Discussions. Click on the

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.200
link that is in bold, and has a star in

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.620
front of it. Now, the star means that I created

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.340
this thread for you to submit your responses. After I

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.790
click on it, a new tab opens with a Discussion forum.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.920
Here, you can simply scroll down, to submit your responses. So here I am,

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.100
back to the original question, which is, if you were writing the take a break

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.440
program, what steps would you take to get to the output? Make sure you submit

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.060
your responses on the Discussion forum, and,

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.320
check this box after you've submitted your answer.
