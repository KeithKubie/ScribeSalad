I want to talk about a problem in

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920
I want to talk about a problem in
 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.750
I want to talk about a problem in
mathematics called billiards of study

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760
mathematics called billiards of study
 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.850
mathematics called billiards of study
billiards and talk about maybe a couple

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860
billiards and talk about maybe a couple
 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.259
billiards and talk about maybe a couple
of aspects of that these are called

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269
of aspects of that these are called
 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.530
of aspects of that these are called
polygonal billiards you have some figure

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540
polygonal billiards you have some figure
 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.859
polygonal billiards you have some figure
in the plane maybe it has straight sides

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869
in the plane maybe it has straight sides
 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.170
in the plane maybe it has straight sides
or maybe not you can either think of

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180
or maybe not you can either think of
 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.580
or maybe not you can either think of
this as billiards or you could think of

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590
this as billiards or you could think of
 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.920
this as billiards or you could think of
this as a room where the sides of the

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930
this as a room where the sides of the
 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.410
this as a room where the sides of the
room have a mirror start at a point and

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420
room have a mirror start at a point and
 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.810
room have a mirror start at a point and
we move in a straight line starting at

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820
we move in a straight line starting at
 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.179
we move in a straight line starting at
the point until we come to the side and

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189
the point until we come to the side and
 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.880
the point until we come to the side and
then we bounce off the side with the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890
then we bounce off the side with the
 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.790
then we bounce off the side with the
angle of reflection equal the angle of

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800
angle of reflection equal the angle of
 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.290
angle of reflection equal the angle of
incidence so these two angles are the

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300
incidence so these two angles are the
 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.690
incidence so these two angles are the
same and then we continue till we hit to

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700
same and then we continue till we hit to
 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.729
same and then we continue till we hit to
another side we bounce off where the

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739
another side we bounce off where the
 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.619
another side we bounce off where the
angle of incidence equals the angle

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629
angle of incidence equals the angle
 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.930
angle of incidence equals the angle
reflection and so forth when you hit

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940
reflection and so forth when you hit
 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.330
reflection and so forth when you hit
into a corner there's no way of saying

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340
into a corner there's no way of saying
 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.760
into a corner there's no way of saying
what reflection means and so if you are

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770
what reflection means and so if you are
 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.410
what reflection means and so if you are
a billiard player you maybe think of

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420
a billiard player you maybe think of
 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.060
a billiard player you maybe think of
this as pocket billiards we could also

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070
this as pocket billiards we could also
 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.939
this as pocket billiards we could also
think of this as I say is a room with

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949
think of this as I say is a room with
 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.569
think of this as I say is a room with
mirrors and you are moving along maybe a

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579
mirrors and you are moving along maybe a
 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.179
mirrors and you are moving along maybe a
light source a beam of light comes to a

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189
light source a beam of light comes to a
 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.609
light source a beam of light comes to a
mirror and then it reflects in the

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619
mirror and then it reflects in the
 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.740
mirror and then it reflects in the
mirror and continues on in a straight

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750
mirror and continues on in a straight
 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.320
mirror and continues on in a straight
line and so forth and these things go

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330
line and so forth and these things go
 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.200
line and so forth and these things go
forever like if they hit a corner these

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210
forever like if they hit a corner these
 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.640
forever like if they hit a corner these
things go forever unless they hit a

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650
things go forever unless they hit a
 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.590
things go forever unless they hit a
corner yes okay so I'm going to talk

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600
corner yes okay so I'm going to talk
 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.140
corner yes okay so I'm going to talk
about at least to start with a problem

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150
about at least to start with a problem
 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.570
about at least to start with a problem
called an illumination problem so maybe

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580
called an illumination problem so maybe
 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.149
called an illumination problem so maybe
I have a new figure of a billiard table

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159
I have a new figure of a billiard table
 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.370
I have a new figure of a billiard table
maybe think of that as a room now that's

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380
maybe think of that as a room now that's
 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.469
maybe think of that as a room now that's
a kind of a funny shaped room but

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479
a kind of a funny shaped room but
 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.469
a kind of a funny shaped room but
nonetheless and I have I put a candle at

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479
nonetheless and I have I put a candle at
 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.780
nonetheless and I have I put a candle at
a certain point in the room that's my

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790
a certain point in the room that's my
 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.880
a certain point in the room that's my
kind of a light source and the question

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890
kind of a light source and the question
 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.700
kind of a light source and the question
is does that candle illuminate every

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710
is does that candle illuminate every
 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.770
is does that candle illuminate every
point in the room so that means that if

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780
point in the room so that means that if
 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.780
point in the room so that means that if
I have some other point in the room is

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790
I have some other point in the room is
 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.240
I have some other point in the room is
there a beam of light that will start at

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250
there a beam of light that will start at
 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.730
there a beam of light that will start at
the candle and start bouncing off the

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740
the candle and start bouncing off the
 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.530
the candle and start bouncing off the
walls of the room may be many many

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540
walls of the room may be many many
 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.980
walls of the room may be many many
bounces until it finally hits that point

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990
bounces until it finally hits that point
 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.370
bounces until it finally hits that point
so in other words does the candle

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380
so in other words does the candle
 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.139
so in other words does the candle
illuminate the entire room or are there

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149
illuminate the entire room or are there
 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.999
illuminate the entire room or are there
places in the room which are dark that

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009
places in the room which are dark that
 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.950
places in the room which are dark that
the candle doesn't illuminate the

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960
the candle doesn't illuminate the
 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.499
the candle doesn't illuminate the
question is moving in any direction can

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509
question is moving in any direction can
 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.570
question is moving in any direction can
you get to this point the candle is

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580
you get to this point the candle is
 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.699
you get to this point the candle is
radiating light out in all directions

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709
radiating light out in all directions
 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.260
radiating light out in all directions
and do you

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270
and do you
 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.300
and do you
every point for example of my room is

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310
every point for example of my room is
 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.880
every point for example of my room is
just a usual kind of a square and my

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890
just a usual kind of a square and my
 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.730
just a usual kind of a square and my
candle is anywhere in the room I can

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740
candle is anywhere in the room I can
 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.530
candle is anywhere in the room I can
certainly get to any other place in the

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540
certainly get to any other place in the
 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.870
certainly get to any other place in the
room by just going in a straight line so

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880
room by just going in a straight line so
 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.670
room by just going in a straight line so
I can go here's my candle here's my

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680
I can go here's my candle here's my
 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.290
I can go here's my candle here's my
other point in the room I don't have to

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300
other point in the room I don't have to
 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.930
other point in the room I don't have to
do any bouncing off walls because I just

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940
do any bouncing off walls because I just
 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.850
do any bouncing off walls because I just
go in a straight line this kind of room

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860
go in a straight line this kind of room
 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.210
go in a straight line this kind of room
is called convex which means that you

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220
is called convex which means that you
 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.850
is called convex which means that you
can join any two points by a line

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860
can join any two points by a line
 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.330
can join any two points by a line
without bouncing off the sides so convex

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340
without bouncing off the sides so convex
 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.000
without bouncing off the sides so convex
rooms it's obvious or clear that

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010
rooms it's obvious or clear that
 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.360
rooms it's obvious or clear that
illumination happens this room is not

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370
illumination happens this room is not
 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.210
illumination happens this room is not
convex because if I'm at this point

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220
convex because if I'm at this point
 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.430
convex because if I'm at this point
there is no straight line that gets me

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440
there is no straight line that gets me
 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.740
there is no straight line that gets me
from the candle to this point because

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750
from the candle to this point because
 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.110
from the candle to this point because
the straight line would you know leave

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120
the straight line would you know leave
 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.430
the straight line would you know leave
the room and I'm not allowed to do that

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440
the room and I'm not allowed to do that
 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.470
the room and I'm not allowed to do that
the original problem while illumination

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480
the original problem while illumination
 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.320
the original problem while illumination
was asked in the 1950s one question was

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330
was asked in the 1950s one question was
 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.080
was asked in the 1950s one question was
does every point illuminate every other

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090
does every point illuminate every other
 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.170
does every point illuminate every other
point the first example where this was

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180
point the first example where this was
 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.780
point the first example where this was
solved in a way and that was by Roger

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790
solved in a way and that was by Roger
 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.690
solved in a way and that was by Roger
Penrose was a English mathematician and

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700
Penrose was a English mathematician and
 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.810
Penrose was a English mathematician and
physicist what he did was he draws the

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820
physicist what he did was he draws the
 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.780
physicist what he did was he draws the
top half of an ellipse and he draws the

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790
top half of an ellipse and he draws the
 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.600
top half of an ellipse and he draws the
bottom half of an ellipse the same lips

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610
bottom half of an ellipse the same lips
 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.850
bottom half of an ellipse the same lips
but doesn't connect them and instead he

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860
but doesn't connect them and instead he
 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.250
but doesn't connect them and instead he
draws a mushroom and then a similar

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260
draws a mushroom and then a similar
 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.860
draws a mushroom and then a similar
mushroom on the other side the red point

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870
mushroom on the other side the red point
 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.720
mushroom on the other side the red point
here is the focal point of the ellipse

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730
here is the focal point of the ellipse
 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.520
here is the focal point of the ellipse
the top ellipse and here's the other

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530
the top ellipse and here's the other
 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.500
the top ellipse and here's the other
point is the focal point of the top

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510
point is the focal point of the top
 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.300
point is the focal point of the top
ellipse and then these points are the

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310
ellipse and then these points are the
 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.100
ellipse and then these points are the
focal points of the bottom ellipse and

this have to be so complicated well if
you have a polygon as I drove here it's

what what you illuminate is is possibly
 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.620
what what you illuminate is is possibly
pretty complicated and so that's why

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630
pretty complicated and so that's why
 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.659
pretty complicated and so that's why
this first example there was a point

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669
this first example there was a point
 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.180
this first example there was a point
right here with a candle he found a

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190
right here with a candle he found a
 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.700
right here with a candle he found a
single point which was not illuminated

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710
single point which was not illuminated

single point which was not illuminated
by that candle now the difference

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020
by that candle now the difference
 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.340
by that candle now the difference
between this and the Penrose example was

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350
between this and the Penrose example was
 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.020
between this and the Penrose example was
in the Penrose example there was a

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030
in the Penrose example there was a
 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.409
in the Penrose example there was a
candle and there was a whole region two

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419
candle and there was a whole region two
 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.150
candle and there was a whole region two
of them which were not illuminated and

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160
of them which were not illuminated and
 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.770
of them which were not illuminated and
this example is somewhat different it

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780
this example is somewhat different it
 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.540
this example is somewhat different it
and this was kind of the only point that

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550
and this was kind of the only point that
 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.550
and this was kind of the only point that
wasn't illuminated you could get to any

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560
wasn't illuminated you could get to any
 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.190
wasn't illuminated you could get to any
any place in this room except if you

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200
any place in this room except if you
 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.630
any place in this room except if you
were standing right if you stood right

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.640
were standing right if you stood right
 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.790
were standing right if you stood right
there at that point you would be in the

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800
there at that point you would be in the
 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.010
there at that point you would be in the
dark but everybody everywhere else you

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020
dark but everybody everywhere else you
 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.080
dark but everybody everywhere else you
would see the light from the candle so

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090
would see the light from the candle so
 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.670
would see the light from the candle so
it's a little different setup it's an

single point you can think of it as
 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:32.580
single point you can think of it as
infinite ethical but it's a single point

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590
infinite ethical but it's a single point
 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.700
infinite ethical but it's a single point

it's a mathematical construction it's
 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.909
it's a mathematical construction it's
not literally a person standing at a

for any polygon and now I'm going to put

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030
for any polygon and now I'm going to put
 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:09.150
for any polygon and now I'm going to put
a little kind of restriction what I want

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:09.160
a little kind of restriction what I want
 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.370
a little kind of restriction what I want
to look at is when the angles at the

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.380
to look at is when the angles at the
 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.840
to look at is when the angles at the
vertex are a fraction a rational number

P over Q is a rational number times 180

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.030
P over Q is a rational number times 180
 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.500
P over Q is a rational number times 180
degrees so every angle is a rational

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:22.510
degrees so every angle is a rational
 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.260
degrees so every angle is a rational
number times 180 degrees for example a

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270
number times 180 degrees for example a
 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.840

square is square room that angle is 90

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:27.850
square is square room that angle is 90
 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.240
square is square room that angle is 90
degrees that's of course one half of 180

any rational number in degrees they're
 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.510
any rational number in degrees they're
called rational polygons or rational

the dark regions are these as you say
 

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.220
the dark regions are these as you say
infinitesimal points and there are only

infinitesimal points and there are only
 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:50.670
infinitesimal points and there are only
finitely many so maybe two of them or

isn't something that's a whole patch of
infinitely many points so it's

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240
infinitely many points so it's
 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.960
infinitely many points so it's
impossible to construct a rational

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:21.190
whole part of the room which is dark
 

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:22.650
whole part of the room which is dark
that will never happen that even a small

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:22.660
that will never happen that even a small
 

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.590
that will never happen that even a small
one not even a very tiny one what is an

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:25.600
one not even a very tiny one what is an
 

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.720
one not even a very tiny one what is an
irrational polygon for example let me

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:27.730
irrational polygon for example let me
 

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.630
irrational polygon for example let me
draw an irrational triangle and I'm

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:30.640
draw an irrational triangle and I'm
 

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.490
draw an irrational triangle and I'm
going to make the angle here ninety

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:32.500
going to make the angle here ninety
 

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.560
going to make the angle here ninety
times the square root of two let's say

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:34.570
times the square root of two let's say
 

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:36.990
times the square root of two let's say
thirty degrees and then here since the

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:37.000
thirty degrees and then here since the
 

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.680
thirty degrees and then here since the
total is has to be 180 this would be 180

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:40.690
total is has to be 180 this would be 180
 

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.710
total is has to be 180 this would be 180
minus 90 square root of two minus 30

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:43.720
minus 90 square root of two minus 30
 

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.540
minus 90 square root of two minus 30
obviously professor that in convex

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:45.550
obviously professor that in convex
 

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:46.740

because it's not going to be in yeah

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:46.750
because it's not going to be in yeah
 

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:49.050
because it's not going to be in yeah
yeah so triangles of course are convex

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:49.060
yeah so triangles of course are convex
 

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.510
yeah so triangles of course are convex
thank you for that observation so but
