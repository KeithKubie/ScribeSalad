00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:12.580
When life hands you lemons, say, "thank you,"
and use them to do a bunch of science!

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.720
A little while ago, we did a DNews Lab where
we created a battery with lemons!

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.939
But then we had a bunch of extra lemons around,
so we thought… what else can you do with

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:21.939
these…

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:23.060
Turns out, quite a lot.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.000
Lemons contain citric acid, a weak organic
acid that acts as a preservative.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.539
With a pH of 2.2, citric acid which means
it's got Hydrogen ions all over in there,

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.240
aside from making a pretty awesome battery,
the food industry uses sodium citrate all

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.860
the time -- a salt derivative of citric acid
-- it's called sour salt and it gives club

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.430
soda both its sour and salty flavors.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.440
When added to foods, it can lower the acidity,
change the consistency and (like other salts)

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.440
add to the shelf life.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.550
Magically (ok, scientifically), when added
to regular old cheese, this citric acid derivative,

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.100
lets melted cheese create an emulsion with
water or beer or whatever!

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.750
Emulsions are minute droplets of one thing,
suspended in another without clumping back

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:06.750
together.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.920
Basically you can make the best nacho cheese
ever at home.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.490
In 1916, James L. Kraft, figured this out
while creating the chemistry for American

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:14.490
cheese.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.100
To put it simply, a bit of beer, a bit of
sodium citrate, and a bit of your favorite

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.560
cheese creates homemade nacho cheese sauce.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.560
It's amazing.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.560
Make it.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.560
Eat it.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.490
Tweet me if you do.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.170
Lemons aren't just for eating though, human
hair is made of a protein called keratin and

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.820
it normally moisturized by oil from the hair
root.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.960
Sometimes, especially with long hair, the
shafts can dry out, and then you can mess

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.609
with it if you know a little chemistry.

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:41.570
Kid Trace liked doing experiments and, as
you might guess, had very little fashion sense.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.440
Adding lemon juice to hair oxidizes just like
the rust on a bike!

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.840
Hair loves moisture, and lemon juice is moisture,
among other things… but when combined with

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.020
oxygen in the air and UV energy from the sun,
the citric acid causes weak bleaching.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.510
Unfortunately, it also dries the hair out
more, so if you do this, make sure you deep

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.479
condition and get some new moisture in there
but it’s a cheap way and an easy way to

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:06.530
lighten your hair.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.509
If you want to go even more hard core, grab
those lemons and use them to polish your stainless

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.170
steel pots and pans, chrome the bumpers on
a car or faucets, even silver, copper, or

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.850
the brass on your aunt's tuba…

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.420
If your aunt has a tuba.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.569
It requires various mixers, but the citric
acid removes the tarnish from all sorts of

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:24.569
metal.

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.970
There's more acid in the rind than in the
juice, and you don't have all those sugars

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.209
-- so slapping a lemon rind onto a chrome
bumper and rubbing will restore its shine!

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.730
I mean, sure, so you could just make lemonade,
if you're into that sort of thing, but if

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.560
someone hands you lemons make yourself some
cleaners, emulsions and batteries!

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.440
And as long as you're thinking outside of
the box, Toyota is fueling the future with

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.900
the new Toyota Mirai.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.000
Using the most abundant element in the universe,
Hydrogen, the new Mirai is looking to the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.930
future with sustainability in mind.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.069
If you want to see how we used the majority
of our lemons to make a cool-ass battery.

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:13.720
Check out this video (sound up) and if you
have other science experiment ideas we've

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.310
got comments go use 'em.
