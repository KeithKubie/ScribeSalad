a year or so ago I came across my

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010
a year or so ago I came across my
 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.370
a year or so ago I came across my
uncle's thesis when he was an economist

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380
uncle's thesis when he was an economist
 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.410
uncle's thesis when he was an economist
at Stanford and he coined the term

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420
at Stanford and he coined the term
 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.760
at Stanford and he coined the term
information economy and wrote his

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770
information economy and wrote his
 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.310
information economy and wrote his
dissertation on how the economy was

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320
dissertation on how the economy was
 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.410
dissertation on how the economy was
shifting from an industrial economy to

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420
shifting from an industrial economy to
 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.669
shifting from an industrial economy to
an information economy and it was

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679
an information economy and it was
 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.350
an information economy and it was
fascinating to go through his 9 vol

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360
fascinating to go through his 9 vol
 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.450
fascinating to go through his 9 vol
dissertation and start to understand how

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460
dissertation and start to understand how
 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.939
dissertation and start to understand how
the economy has evolved over time I sort

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949
the economy has evolved over time I sort
 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.620
the economy has evolved over time I sort
of always assumed the economy was more

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630
of always assumed the economy was more
 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.060
of always assumed the economy was more
or less the way it is but what I came to

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070
or less the way it is but what I came to
 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.429
or less the way it is but what I came to
realize was that we started off as

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439
realize was that we started off as
 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.470
realize was that we started off as
hunters and gatherers and that's how we

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480
hunters and gatherers and that's how we
 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.730
hunters and gatherers and that's how we
were able to survive but then we learned

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740
were able to survive but then we learned
 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.890
were able to survive but then we learned
how to use the land and animals and to

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900
how to use the land and animals and to
 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.209
how to use the land and animals and to
settle down and created an agrarian

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219
settle down and created an agrarian
 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.549
settle down and created an agrarian
economy and this it lasted thousands of

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559
economy and this it lasted thousands of
 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.190
economy and this it lasted thousands of
years but then we turn into an

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200
years but then we turn into an
 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.299
years but then we turn into an
industrial economy we start learning how

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309
industrial economy we start learning how
 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.650
industrial economy we start learning how
to make machines and we start being able

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660
to make machines and we start being able
 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.630
to make machines and we start being able
create assembly lines and it radically

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640
create assembly lines and it radically
 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.000
create assembly lines and it radically
changed our whole economy or society etc

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010
changed our whole economy or society etc
 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.180
changed our whole economy or society etc
and that what happened in the 1960s is

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190
and that what happened in the 1960s is
 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.619
and that what happened in the 1960s is
we actually had a shift where we went

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629
we actually had a shift where we went
 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.660
we actually had a shift where we went
from this industrial economy where the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670
from this industrial economy where the
 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.639
from this industrial economy where the
economy was about how we made things I

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649
economy was about how we made things I
 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.380
economy was about how we made things I
was about manufacturing into this

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390
was about manufacturing into this
 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.880
was about manufacturing into this
information economy which was about

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890
information economy which was about
 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.819
information economy which was about
everything from TV and radio to

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829
everything from TV and radio to
 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.020
everything from TV and radio to
technology to eventually the internet

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030
technology to eventually the internet
 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.729
technology to eventually the internet
and it become the dominant part of the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739
and it become the dominant part of the
 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.349
and it become the dominant part of the
economy and what was interesting in

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359
economy and what was interesting in
 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.080
economy and what was interesting in
looking at his research was not only the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090
looking at his research was not only the
 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.520
looking at his research was not only the
economy had shifted but each of these

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530
economy had shifted but each of these
 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.020
economy had shifted but each of these
economies had gotten shorter and shorter

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030
economies had gotten shorter and shorter
 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.570
economies had gotten shorter and shorter
the agrarian economy was thousands of

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580
the agrarian economy was thousands of
 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.429
the agrarian economy was thousands of
years the Industrial is just a few

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439
years the Industrial is just a few
 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.350
years the Industrial is just a few
hundred and it seems likely that the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360
hundred and it seems likely that the
 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.600
hundred and it seems likely that the
information economy wouldn't last that

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610
information economy wouldn't last that
 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.070
information economy wouldn't last that
long I may be much shorter than the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080
long I may be much shorter than the
 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.929
long I may be much shorter than the
industrial economy and as I looked at

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939
industrial economy and as I looked at
 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.260
industrial economy and as I looked at
what are the things that gave us

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270
what are the things that gave us
 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.060
what are the things that gave us
indication the economy was shifting to

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070
indication the economy was shifting to
 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.039
indication the economy was shifting to
this information economy I started to

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049
this information economy I started to
 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.359
this information economy I started to
realize there were similar things that

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369
realize there were similar things that
 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.520
realize there were similar things that
were happening today there may be signs

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530
were happening today there may be signs
 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.350
were happening today there may be signs
that the economy is changing again that

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360
that the economy is changing again that
 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.210
that the economy is changing again that
we may be entering the fourth economy in

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220
we may be entering the fourth economy in
 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.130
we may be entering the fourth economy in
our history a fourth economy based on

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140
our history a fourth economy based on
 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.969
our history a fourth economy based on
advances and where we are as a society

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979
advances and where we are as a society
 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.740
advances and where we are as a society
what our needs are as a society and I

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750
what our needs are as a society and I
 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.480
what our needs are as a society and I
started looking around trying to figure

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490
started looking around trying to figure
 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.520
started looking around trying to figure
out what do all these different pieces

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530
out what do all these different pieces
 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.109
out what do all these different pieces
add up to and you started seeing books

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119
add up to and you started seeing books
 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.179
add up to and you started seeing books
an article showing up everywhere people

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189
an article showing up everywhere people
 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.190
an article showing up everywhere people
talking about sharing people talking

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200
talking about sharing people talking
 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.560
talking about sharing people talking
about maker economy now people are

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570
about maker economy now people are
 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.170
about maker economy now people are
making their own products to people

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180
making their own products to people
 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.670
making their own products to people
shopping and doing more around

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680
shopping and doing more around
 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.340
shopping and doing more around
experience all these different trends

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350
experience all these different trends
 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.990
experience all these different trends
that were happening throughout society

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000
that were happening throughout society
 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.639
that were happening throughout society
and I started drawing all these

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649
and I started drawing all these
 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.679
and I started drawing all these
different trends on a whiteboard showing

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689
different trends on a whiteboard showing
 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.749
different trends on a whiteboard showing
where they existed and how they

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759
where they existed and how they
 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.339
where they existed and how they
connected to each other and when I took

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349
connected to each other and when I took
 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.330
connected to each other and when I took
a step back something emerged

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340
a step back something emerged
 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.830
a step back something emerged
