00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.668
All right, I hope that went well. We

00:00:02.668 --> 00:00:05.560
will now talk about the most flexible query mechanism

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.010
in Datastore. Query by kind, filter by property. Let's

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.400
say you would like to query for all conferences

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.600
that are in a particular city, for example

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.620
Halloween, and with a specific topic like movie making,

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.080
and then sort the matching entries by conference name.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.360
For example, if we were to write this out

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.620
it could look like this. Retrieve all conferences that

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.990
are in the city Halloween, and has moving making

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.180
in the topic. Sort the result by name. This

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.650
is an example of query by kind, filter by property,

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.060
since we are using property values in the search

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.810
and the sort. Let's look at this a little

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.760
bit closer. We want to have an exact match

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.625
for the city since we are only interested in conferences

00:00:50.625 --> 00:00:53.930
in Halloween. This is called an equality filter.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.210
Then, we want to further restrict the queries

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.960
so that only entities which has movie making

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.510
in the topic are displayed. This is called a

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.900
member of filter. We are combining these with

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.820
the and operator, meaning that both of these conditions

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.800
must be true. And finally, we are sorting

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.030
the result by name. Let's look at filters and

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.100
how you can use them to construct a query in

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.950
more detail. The first filter is the equality filter, that

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.020
we used for city in our example. Then, we have

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.640
the member of filter, which has the same symbol as

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.530
the equality filter. This filter, we use to sort by

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.100
topic. Then we have a set of inequality filters, not

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.870
equal to, less than, less than or equal to, greater

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.100
than, greater than or equal to. And all of these can

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.470
be combined using the Boolean operators and, and

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.860
or. That's enough theory to get started. So

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.910
now it's time for you to add query

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.800
by kind, filter by property, to conference central.
