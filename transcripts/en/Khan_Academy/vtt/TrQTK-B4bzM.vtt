00:00:00.877 --> 00:00:05.027
- [Voiceover] Let F be
a continuous function

00:00:05.027 --> 00:00:08.250
on the closed interval
from negative two to one

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.238
where F of negative two is equal to three

00:00:11.238 --> 00:00:13.424
and F of one is equal to six.

00:00:13.424 --> 00:00:15.560
Which of the following is guaranteed

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.097
by the Intermediate Value Theorem?

00:00:18.097 --> 00:00:19.486
So before I even look at this,

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:22.022
what do we know about the
Intermediate Value Theorem?

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:23.384
Well it applies here,

00:00:23.384 --> 00:00:25.654
it's a continuous function
on this closed interval.

00:00:25.654 --> 00:00:29.232
We know what the value of the
function is at negative two.

00:00:29.232 --> 00:00:31.555
It's three so let me write that.

00:00:31.555 --> 00:00:34.599
F of negative two is equal to three

00:00:34.599 --> 00:00:38.098
and F of one, they tell
us right over here,

00:00:38.098 --> 00:00:39.673
is equal to six

00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:41.863
and all the Intermediate
Value Theorem tells us

00:00:41.863 --> 00:00:43.465
and if this is completely
unfamiliar to you,

00:00:43.465 --> 00:00:45.036
I encourage you to watch the video

00:00:45.036 --> 00:00:46.852
on the Intermediate Value Theorem,

00:00:46.852 --> 00:00:48.561
is that if we have a continuous function

00:00:48.561 --> 00:00:50.596
on some closed interval,

00:00:50.596 --> 00:00:54.401
then the function must take on every value

00:00:54.401 --> 00:00:58.674
between the values at the
endpoints of the interval

00:00:58.674 --> 00:01:01.344
or another way to say it is

00:01:01.344 --> 00:01:02.177
for any L

00:01:06.311 --> 00:01:08.144
between three and six,

00:01:11.455 --> 00:01:12.622
three and six,

00:01:14.562 --> 00:01:17.068
there is at least one C,

00:01:17.068 --> 00:01:19.068
there is at least one C,

00:01:25.296 --> 00:01:26.872
one C,

00:01:26.872 --> 00:01:31.518
between, or I could say
once C in the interval

00:01:31.518 --> 00:01:36.058
from negative two to
one, the closed interval,

00:01:36.058 --> 00:01:38.641
such that F of C is equal to L.

00:01:42.253 --> 00:01:45.266
This comes straight out of
the Intermediate Value Theorem

00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:46.762
and just saying it in everyday language

00:01:46.762 --> 00:01:48.497
is look this is a continuous function.

00:01:48.497 --> 00:01:51.096
Actually I'll draw it
visually in a few seconds.

00:01:51.096 --> 00:01:54.989
But it makes sense that
if it's continuous,

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:57.292
if I were to draw the graph,
I can't pick up my pencil,

00:01:57.292 --> 00:01:58.984
well that it makes sense
that I would have to

00:01:58.984 --> 00:02:01.734
take on every value between three and six

00:02:01.734 --> 00:02:03.951
or there's at least one
point in this interval

00:02:03.951 --> 00:02:07.662
where I take on any given
value between three and six.

00:02:07.662 --> 00:02:10.333
So let's see which of these
answers are consistent with that

00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:11.774
and we only pick one.

00:02:11.774 --> 00:02:13.607
So F of C equals four.

00:02:15.273 --> 00:02:18.242
So that would be a case
where L is equal to four.

00:02:18.242 --> 00:02:20.325
So there's at least one C

00:02:22.822 --> 00:02:25.973
in this interval such that
F of C is equal to four.

00:02:25.973 --> 00:02:27.628
We could say that.

00:02:27.628 --> 00:02:29.930
But that's not exactly
what they're saying here.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.263
F of C could be four for at least one C,

00:02:34.151 --> 00:02:38.584
not in this interval,
remember the C is our X.

00:02:38.584 --> 00:02:40.827
This is our X right over here.

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:43.738
So the C is going to be in this interval

00:02:43.738 --> 00:02:45.634
and I'll take a look at
it visually in a second

00:02:45.634 --> 00:02:47.743
so that we can validate that.

00:02:47.743 --> 00:02:49.078
We're not saying for at least one C

00:02:49.078 --> 00:02:52.069
between three and six F
of C is equal to four,

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.329
we're saying for at least
one C in this interval

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.898
F of C is going to be equal to four.

00:02:58.898 --> 00:03:01.942
It's important that four
is between three and six

00:03:01.942 --> 00:03:04.105
because that's the value of our function

00:03:04.105 --> 00:03:07.843
and the C needs to be
in our closed interval

00:03:07.843 --> 00:03:09.792
along the x-axis.

00:03:09.792 --> 00:03:11.555
So I'm gonna rule this out.

00:03:11.555 --> 00:03:13.451
They're trying to confuse us.

00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:14.759
Alright.

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:17.842
F of C equals zero for at least one C

00:03:18.925 --> 00:03:20.401
between negative two and one.

00:03:20.401 --> 00:03:23.926
Well here they got the interval
along the x-axis right,

00:03:23.926 --> 00:03:25.635
that's where the C would be between,

00:03:25.635 --> 00:03:28.065
but it's not guaranteed by
the Intermediate Value Theorem

00:03:28.065 --> 00:03:30.361
that F of C is going to be equal to zero

00:03:30.361 --> 00:03:33.806
because zero is not between three and six.

00:03:33.806 --> 00:03:36.530
So I'm gonna rule that one out.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.128
I'm going to rule this one out,

00:03:38.128 --> 00:03:40.317
it's saying F of C equals zero,

00:03:40.317 --> 00:03:41.706
and let's see, we're
only left with this one

00:03:41.706 --> 00:03:42.828
so I hope it works.

00:03:42.828 --> 00:03:44.456
So F of C is equal to four,

00:03:44.456 --> 00:03:45.658
well that seems reasonable because

00:03:45.658 --> 00:03:47.954
four is between three and six,

00:03:47.954 --> 00:03:51.239
for at least one C between
negative two and one.

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.363
Well yeah because that's in
this interval right over here.

00:03:54.363 --> 00:03:57.176
So I am feeling good about that

00:03:57.176 --> 00:03:59.193
and we could think about
this visually as well.

00:03:59.193 --> 00:04:00.181
The Intermediate Value Theorem

00:04:00.181 --> 00:04:03.385
when you think about it
visually makes a lot of sense.

00:04:03.385 --> 00:04:06.718
So let me draw the x-axis first actually

00:04:07.631 --> 00:04:10.595
and then let me draw my y-axis

00:04:10.595 --> 00:04:12.006
and I'm gonna draw them
at different scales

00:04:12.006 --> 00:04:14.276
'cause my y-axis, well let's see.

00:04:14.276 --> 00:04:16.776
If this is six, this is three.

00:04:19.429 --> 00:04:21.325
That's my y-axis.

00:04:21.325 --> 00:04:24.158
This is one, this is negative one,

00:04:25.411 --> 00:04:27.078
this is negative two

00:04:28.482 --> 00:04:30.484
and so we're continuous
on the closed interval

00:04:30.484 --> 00:04:32.193
from negative two to one

00:04:32.193 --> 00:04:34.677
and F of negative two is equal to three.

00:04:34.677 --> 00:04:35.665
So let me plot that.

00:04:35.665 --> 00:04:38.224
F of negative two is equal to three.

00:04:38.224 --> 00:04:40.601
So that's right over there

00:04:40.601 --> 00:04:43.744
and F of one is equal to six.

00:04:43.744 --> 00:04:45.533
So that's right over there

00:04:45.533 --> 00:04:49.325
and so let's try to draw
a continuous function.

00:04:49.325 --> 00:04:53.304
So a continuous function
includes these points

00:04:53.304 --> 00:04:55.787
and it's continuous so an
intuitive way to think about it

00:04:55.787 --> 00:04:57.515
is I can't pick up my
pencil if I'm drawing

00:04:57.515 --> 00:05:00.319
the graph of the function,
which contains these two points.

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:01.902
So I can't do that.

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:04.378
That would be picking up my pencil.

00:05:04.378 --> 00:05:06.834
So it is a continuous function.

00:05:06.834 --> 00:05:08.730
So it takes on every value.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.386
As we can see, it definitely does that.

00:05:10.386 --> 00:05:13.323
It takes on every value
between three and six.

00:05:13.323 --> 00:05:15.709
It might take on other
values, but we know for sure

00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:19.568
it has to take on every
value between three and six

00:05:19.568 --> 00:05:23.735
and so if we think about
four, four is right over here.

00:05:24.695 --> 00:05:27.098
The way I drew it, it looks
like it's almost taking on

00:05:27.098 --> 00:05:30.022
that value right at the y-axis.

00:05:30.022 --> 00:05:32.906
I forgot to label my x-axis here.

00:05:32.906 --> 00:05:34.771
But you can see it took on that value

00:05:34.771 --> 00:05:39.362
in for a C in this case
between negative two and one

00:05:39.362 --> 00:05:41.595
and I could have drawn that
graph multiple different ways.

00:05:41.595 --> 00:05:44.381
I could have drawn it something
like I could have done it

00:05:44.381 --> 00:05:45.223
and actually it takes on,

00:05:45.223 --> 00:05:48.587
there's multiple times it
takes on the value four here.

00:05:48.587 --> 00:05:50.990
So this could be our C, but once again

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.884
it's between the interval
negative two and one.

00:05:53.884 --> 00:05:55.820
This could be our C once again

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.063
in the interval between
negative two and one

00:05:58.063 --> 00:05:59.799
or this could be our C in between

00:05:59.799 --> 00:06:00.973
the interval of negative two and one

00:06:00.973 --> 00:06:02.869
and that's just the way
I happen to draw it.

00:06:02.869 --> 00:06:06.020
I could have drawn this thing
as just a straight line.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.863
I could have drawn it like this

00:06:07.863 --> 00:06:11.227
and then it looks like
it's taking on for only one

00:06:11.227 --> 00:06:14.592
and it's doing it right around there.

00:06:14.592 --> 00:06:18.794
This isn't necessarily
true that you take on,

00:06:18.794 --> 00:06:20.489
that you become four for at least one C

00:06:20.489 --> 00:06:21.691
between three and six.

00:06:21.691 --> 00:06:24.228
Three and six aren't
even on our graph here.

00:06:24.228 --> 00:06:28.153
I would have to go all
the way to two, three.

00:06:28.153 --> 00:06:33.013
There's not guarantee that
our function takes on four

00:06:33.013 --> 00:06:35.283
for one C between three and six.

00:06:35.283 --> 00:06:37.152
We don't even know what the function does

00:06:37.152 --> 00:06:39.819
when X is between three and six.
