00:00:01.434 --> 00:00:04.871 line:0%
- This week ESPN obtained
emails and text messages

00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:07.774 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
that provided more information
on a rape allegation

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:12.679 line:0%
against Mavericks star former
Knick, Kristaps Porzingis.

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.815
The acquistion that ESPN had

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:19.219 align:start size:84% position:16%
was essentially a
handwritten agreement

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:22.422
between Porzingis
and his accuser

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:26.659
in which he allegedly
promised to pay $68,000

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:31.431 align:start size:97% position:3%
to her brother's college
fund in order to keep quiet.

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:33.767 align:start size:88% position:13%
He never paid that
money according to her,

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:35.435
and now she is suing him.

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:36.703
- Now, listen.

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:38.538
This has got to be
the best sister ever

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:40.040 align:start size:84% position:16%
if she's just like,
"You know what?

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.242
"I was sexually assaulted.

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:46.246
"Gotta think about my
brother on this one.

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:49.849 align:start size:84% position:16%
"Got to pay down
those student loans.

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:51.084
"Make it worth it."

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:55.422 align:start size:88% position:13%
- And the document came
out that was signed

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:58.892
according to her
lawyers that night.

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:01.594
So he played in a game
that day, that night.

00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:04.230
He tore his ACL in that game

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.099 align:start size:84% position:16%
so it was a big
moment for his career.

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:08.401
She lives in his
apartment building,

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:09.636
and according to her,

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:11.404
they stayed together
until the morning,

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:13.840
and by the end of it, he
signed that agreement.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.708
- Well, he said he got
drunk with his brothers.

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:16.943
His brothers were there.

00:01:16.943 --> 00:01:18.311 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's like there's a
video documenting that

00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:20.213
that they did shots of tequila.

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:21.081
They go back to his place.

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:22.282
They're getting drunk.

00:01:22.282 --> 00:01:23.850 align:start size:84% position:16%
I think she may have
drank with them.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.351
I might be wrong about that.

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:27.020
But then she says she went
up later on late that night

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.388
to get an autograph?

00:01:28.388 --> 00:01:29.722
Was that her excuse?

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:31.891
And then he assaulted her.

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:33.493
She says they spent
the night together.

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:35.862
He agreed to $65 grand,

00:01:35.862 --> 00:01:38.298
and then pulled out an agreement

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:42.602
like he pulls out
of so many things.

00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:45.004
And then she went to the police.

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:48.174
You know, I think...

00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:50.176
I feel bad for the
brother, you know,

00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:52.078
who thought this
was his big chance,

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:55.014
and again, this
is a crazy story.

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:56.316
It just keeps getting crazier.

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:57.851
I think it's crazy
that Mark Cuban...

00:01:57.851 --> 00:02:00.420
Like when they made the trade
from the Knicks to the Mavs,

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.888
everyone knew about it.

00:02:01.888 --> 00:02:03.957 align:start size:94% position:6%
The NBA's known about
this for quite some time.

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:05.492
I don't know what to think.

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:07.460 align:start size:88% position:13%
There's a lot of
different stories here,

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.995
but I'll tell you this.

00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:12.599 align:start size:97% position:3%
We here at The Rosenthal
and Jeselnik Vanity Project.

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.867
- JRVP.
- JRVP.

00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:14.834
Junior Vice President.

00:02:14.834 --> 00:02:15.668
- Did I fuck it up?

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:17.003
- You did.

00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:17.837
- Let's go back.

00:02:17.837 --> 00:02:19.339
We here...

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:21.975
Cause I wanna make sure
this point is driven home

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:25.378 align:start size:88% position:13%
like we would drive
home a lover afterwards.

00:02:25.378 --> 00:02:26.312
- That's right.

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:27.547
- Even though we're demanding.

00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:29.048 align:start size:81% position:19%
We would demand
to drive them home

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:30.183
to make sure they're safe,
no matter how drunk we were.

00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:31.017
- That's right.

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:32.418
- As a threesome.

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:34.787
- One of us would be fine.

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:36.756 align:start size:97% position:3%
- We here at The Jeselnik
and Rosenthal Vanity Project

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:37.590
- JRVP.
- JRVP.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.359
Junior Vice President.

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:42.128
- We believe the victims.
- We believe the victims.

00:02:42.128 --> 00:02:43.897 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Greg, what's
our next headline?

00:02:43.897 --> 00:02:44.931
- I mean, I could just say it.

00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:46.065
You don't have to ask me

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:47.600 align:start size:84% position:16%
what the next headline
is every time.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.102
- But I wanted to know

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:51.004 align:start size:97% position:3%
because I feel like that
last one was a hardcore one.

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:54.440 align:start size:81% position:19%
Erica's Corner
was overtly sexual

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.011 align:start size:94% position:6%
in a way that, I think,
made us all uncomfortable.

00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:01.581 align:start position:0%
I feel like whatever Stu's
doing on his honeymoon right now

00:03:01.581 --> 00:03:05.118
ain't as sexy as what
we're doing in here.

00:03:05.118 --> 00:03:06.486 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I mean this is a
pretty sexy story, too.

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:09.689
If you like the last 15
minutes of this show,

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.626
you are gonna love the news
out of Australia this week

00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:16.696
that an Aussie appeals
court decided on Friday,

00:03:18.164 --> 00:03:22.635
they dismissed a bullying
case against a former boss

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:26.673
by an ex-employee
of his who alleged

00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:29.943 align:start size:88% position:13%
that the boss repeatedly
farted around him

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:32.845
and that constituted bullying

00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:35.515
over the course of nine months.

00:03:35.515 --> 00:03:38.651
He's suing him for $1.3 million

00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:42.922
for farting upwards of
five to six times a day

00:03:44.824 --> 00:03:48.795
in the man's small
windowless office.

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:51.331
- And he claims he did
it strictly to bully him.

00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:53.032 align:start size:81% position:19%
Like he would walk
into the office

00:03:53.032 --> 00:03:54.400
and let one go and then leave?

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.703 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Yeah, the supervisor's
name was Greg Short

00:03:56.703 --> 00:03:59.439
which just feels like a
perfect name for a guy

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:02.609 align:start size:84% position:16%
who would go into
another guy's office.

00:04:03.876 --> 00:04:05.111
The thing that really got me

00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:06.779
was it was five to
six times a day.

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:07.981 align:start size:84% position:16%
- But they didn't work
in the same office.

00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:08.982
The guy would come in...

00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:09.916
- It was his boss.

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:11.017
Yeah, not in the same office,

00:04:11.017 --> 00:04:12.585
but he would come in,

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:14.587
and there's no windows.

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:16.289
It's a small office,

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:19.025
and then he would
fart on the guy

00:04:19.892 --> 00:04:21.127
you know, many times a day,

00:04:21.127 --> 00:04:22.128
and he would talk about it.

00:04:22.128 --> 00:04:23.162
It wasn't just like he would

00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:25.798
kind of like sneak up and do it.

00:04:25.798 --> 00:04:28.201
He would, you know,
make jokes about it,

00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:29.435 align:start size:88% position:13%
and he's like he thought
it would be funny

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:30.670
if he did it like once or twice,

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.205
but he was saying
this guy did it

00:04:32.205 --> 00:04:35.041 align:start size:84% position:16%
like five or six times
a day, every day.

00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:35.975
- That was, that was...

00:04:35.975 --> 00:04:36.876
So three was the breaking point.

00:04:38.044 --> 00:04:39.846
Like once you get
past one or two,

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:41.047
that's too much.

00:04:41.047 --> 00:04:43.116 align:start size:88% position:13%
I like that in Australia
bullying is illegal,

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:45.852
but they can't define bullying.

00:04:45.852 --> 00:04:48.855 align:start size:88% position:13%
I had a science teacher
my freshman year

00:04:48.855 --> 00:04:50.323
who was a crazy person

00:04:50.323 --> 00:04:52.659
who was like pretty
normal in all aspects

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:54.360
but if he ever smelled anything

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.928
that smelled like
it could be a fart,

00:04:55.928 --> 00:04:57.764
he would like close
the door of the class

00:04:57.764 --> 00:04:59.265
and yell at all of us.

00:04:59.265 --> 00:05:00.366
Be like, "Guys, who did it?

00:05:00.366 --> 00:05:02.235
"Who farted right now?"

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:05.138 align:start size:88% position:13%
And one time he is
cleaning out an aquarium

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:06.706
with like a vacuum,

00:05:06.706 --> 00:05:10.376
and the smell is horrific
because it's like fish shit

00:05:10.376 --> 00:05:11.511
and whatever is in an aquarium.

00:05:11.511 --> 00:05:12.445
It smells so bad,

00:05:12.445 --> 00:05:14.447
and he stops the vacuum,

00:05:14.447 --> 00:05:16.215
pulls all the guys
into the other room,

00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:18.618 align:start size:84% position:16%
and goes, "Guys, who
shit themselves?"

00:05:18.618 --> 00:05:20.086
And we're all laughing so hard.

00:05:20.086 --> 00:05:21.387 align:start size:97% position:3%
He's getting madder and
madder that we're laughing.

00:05:21.387 --> 00:05:23.222
We have no idea what
he's talking about.

00:05:23.222 --> 00:05:24.424
He brings us all
back into class,

00:05:24.424 --> 00:05:26.292 align:start size:84% position:16%
and in front of
the girls and guys,

00:05:26.292 --> 00:05:30.430
gives us a speech about how
if anyone ever passes gas

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.133
in his classroom ever again,
they're getting kicked out

00:05:34.133 --> 00:05:35.368
and they're going to the office,

00:05:35.368 --> 00:05:37.303 align:start size:88% position:13%
and we're trying to hold
it together so badly,

00:05:37.303 --> 00:05:40.173
and I have the presence
of mind to raise my hand

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:41.407
while he's yelling,

00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:42.909
and the guy who sat next to me

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:44.644
was a friend of mine
named Justin Bayer.

00:05:44.644 --> 00:05:46.079
Shout out to Justin.

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:48.514
And I raise my hand, and I say,

00:05:48.514 --> 00:05:50.850
"Mr Leeds, while
you were talking,

00:05:51.884 --> 00:05:53.820
"Justin farted three times."

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.689
And Mr. Leeds blows his stack,

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:58.891
goes, "Justin, get up
and get out of here."

00:05:58.891 --> 00:06:00.560 align:start size:88% position:13%
And Justin on the
verge of tears is like,

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.961 align:start size:88% position:13%
"You're not going to
tell him you're joking?"

00:06:01.961 --> 00:06:05.031
And I'm laughing too
hard to say anything,

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:06.632
and he got sent to
the office that day

00:06:06.632 --> 00:06:07.867 align:start size:84% position:16%
which was one of
the funniest things.

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:09.001 align:start size:81% position:19%
- What do you tell
the principal?

00:06:09.001 --> 00:06:10.370
I like farted.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.871
- He said like he passed gas,

00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:13.973
and then I had another friend
who got in the same trouble

00:06:13.973 --> 00:06:16.008 align:start size:84% position:16%
where Mr. Leeds yelled
at him for farting.

00:06:16.008 --> 00:06:17.744
He's like, "Mr. Leeds,
it's a bodily function.

00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:19.011
"I can't help it."

00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:20.480
And Mr. Leeds sent
him to the office,

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.749
and the principal says,
"So Mr. Leeds tells me

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:24.217
"that you told him you'll
fart whenever you want,

00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:27.286
"and there's nothing
he can do to stop you."

00:06:27.286 --> 00:06:28.221
And he was like, "No!

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:29.622
"Why is this guy so crazy?"

00:06:29.622 --> 00:06:30.990
He's a biology teacher

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.394
who couldn't stand a
biological function.

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:36.262
- What happened to
Mr. Leeds as a child

00:06:36.262 --> 00:06:37.096
that led to this?

00:06:37.096 --> 00:06:37.964
Maybe he was bullied.

00:06:37.964 --> 00:06:39.198
- I think looking back,

00:06:39.198 --> 00:06:41.634 align:start size:88% position:13%
I think it's very
possible that Mr. Leeds

00:06:41.634 --> 00:06:43.903 align:start size:94% position:6%
smoked marijuana
throughout the school day.

00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:46.773
I think that was his problem.

00:06:46.773 --> 00:06:48.674
He was a fun teacher,

00:06:48.674 --> 00:06:52.311 align:start size:97% position:3%
but I wouldn't say he
inspired anyone to do anything

00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:54.847
except never fart.

00:06:58.151 --> 00:06:59.519 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Like he didn't
really teach you much,

00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:00.386
but he taught you that.

00:07:00.386 --> 00:07:01.687
- Mm-hmm.

00:07:01.687 --> 00:07:02.955
- That's something.

00:07:02.955 --> 00:07:04.424
The strangest part of
this story was though

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:06.826 align:start size:97% position:3%
that this all happened over
the course of 11 months

00:07:06.826 --> 00:07:08.127
a decade ago.

00:07:08.127 --> 00:07:11.197 align:start size:81% position:19%
Why is he only
suing the guy now?

00:07:11.197 --> 00:07:14.434 align:start size:97% position:3%
He's been holding this in
mentally for that entire time?

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:16.068 align:start size:84% position:16%
And even though
this got dismissed,

00:07:16.068 --> 00:07:17.503
he's trying to take it

00:07:17.503 --> 00:07:20.640 align:start size:94% position:6%
to essentially the Supreme
Court in Australia.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.874
He wants to take it to court.

00:07:21.874 --> 00:07:23.409
- You know, sometimes,
speaking of biology,

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:25.077
sometimes when people fart,
it doesn't smell right away.

00:07:25.077 --> 00:07:26.379
You know what I mean.

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:27.313
There's a little delay on it.

00:07:27.313 --> 00:07:28.815
So it could've been 11 years.

00:07:28.815 --> 00:07:30.216
You don't know how things
work down in Australia.

00:07:30.216 --> 00:07:31.751
Toilets flush backwards.

00:07:31.751 --> 00:07:34.320
It's a different kind of place.

00:07:35.188 --> 00:07:36.389
- What is bullying though?

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:37.657 align:start size:81% position:19%
Would you consider
our actions...

00:07:37.657 --> 00:07:39.158
Like last week, you
were very sensitive

00:07:39.158 --> 00:07:42.862
about the way that Erica and
I don't always lift you up

00:07:42.862 --> 00:07:44.931
as the star of the show.

00:07:44.931 --> 00:07:46.999 align:start size:84% position:16%
We bring up
embarrassing stories.

00:07:46.999 --> 00:07:48.534
- Why are you saying we?

00:07:48.534 --> 00:07:49.702
Erica's never once brought
up an embarrassing story.

00:07:49.702 --> 00:07:51.204
- You threw here.

00:07:51.204 --> 00:07:52.705 align:start size:88% position:13%
Yeah, you threw her into
that, too, last week.

00:07:52.705 --> 00:07:53.806
You were saying that, you
know, we don't do a good...

00:07:53.806 --> 00:07:54.841
Fine, myself.

00:07:55.908 --> 00:07:57.810
Does that constitute bullying?

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.880 align:start size:97% position:3%
- No, I haven't been
bullied in quite some time.

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:04.283
- Okay.

00:08:04.283 --> 00:08:06.452
- Another Mr. Leeds story.

00:08:07.186 --> 00:08:08.654
Mr. Leeds and his...

00:08:08.654 --> 00:08:10.723 align:start size:97% position:3%
He was like, "You get extra
credit if you get a pet

00:08:10.723 --> 00:08:12.325
"and bring it in here
and keep it in a tank."

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:13.359
Like you can get a fish.

00:08:13.359 --> 00:08:14.660
People had piranhas.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.195
People had different things,

00:08:16.195 --> 00:08:18.831
and me and my friend, Jason
Basonge, shout out to Jason,

00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:20.900
went to the store
and bought a snake

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.301
and brought in like a
tiny little baby snake.

00:08:22.301 --> 00:08:23.302
It looked so cool.

00:08:23.302 --> 00:08:25.371
We called it Brimstone Love,

00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:26.806
and we put it in a cage,

00:08:26.806 --> 00:08:28.074 align:start size:94% position:6%
and we're like, "Mr.
Leeds, how do we take care

00:08:28.074 --> 00:08:29.308
"of this thing?"

00:08:29.308 --> 00:08:30.243 align:start size:84% position:16%
And he goes, "Oh, just
put sand in there,

00:08:30.243 --> 00:08:31.444
"like a little bit of water,

00:08:31.444 --> 00:08:32.378 align:start size:84% position:16%
"and put like a
heat lamp over it."

00:08:32.378 --> 00:08:34.113
The next day, the snake is dead.

00:08:34.113 --> 00:08:36.916 align:start size:94% position:6%
It's kidneys have
exploded from dehydration

00:08:36.916 --> 00:08:38.351
and overheating,

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:39.785 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I go, "Mr.
Leeds, what the hell?

00:08:39.785 --> 00:08:41.420
"Like what the hell is this?"

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:44.056 align:start size:88% position:13%
And Mr. Leeds goes, "Oh,
I don't like snakes."

00:08:44.056 --> 00:08:45.725
And we were like, "All right.

00:08:45.725 --> 00:08:47.159
"Do we still get extra credit?

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:49.695
"Cool, cool."
