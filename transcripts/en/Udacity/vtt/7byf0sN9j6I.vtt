So as Doctor Rosenberg just discussed there were lot of applications of Ekman's

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.909
Research. First it demonstrated that emotion can be studied reliably and

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:14.270
objectively through the face. And secondly it led directly to the development

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.950
of the Facial Action Coding System, anatomically based analysis of the human

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:25.190
face. And then lastly, FACS has been applied in many different settings, from

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:31.140
film animators to the development of a TV show called Lie to Me. Which was

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.671
based on Ekman's research

00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:37.092
&gt;&gt; But it's also been used very widely by emotion researchers themselves as well

00:00:37.092 --> 00:00:41.930
as people who study deception. So as you can see here, there's many

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.050
applications of emotion research. And now, we're going to go to Lauren who's

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.809
going to ask you another question about emotion and facial expression.
