00:00:00.612 --> 00:00:02.170
Regardless of your opinion

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.544
of how much regulation
or how much intervention

00:00:04.543 --> 00:00:07.310
the government should have in markets,

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.542
in capitalism generally,

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:11.300
I think it's interesting to take a look

00:00:11.301 --> 00:00:12.490
at the various cycles that have happened

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.253
in the United States,

00:00:13.253 --> 00:00:14.764
both from an economic point of view

00:00:14.765 --> 00:00:16.769
and also from a regulatory point of view.

00:00:16.768 --> 00:00:19.348
If we start in the late 1800s,

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:21.382
in the late 1800s so
we've had the Civil War,

00:00:21.382 --> 00:00:23.050
we've had Reconstruction.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.859
You actually have a crisis,

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:26.754
kind of a depression after the Civil War,

00:00:26.754 --> 00:00:28.052
but then after that depression,

00:00:28.053 --> 00:00:29.394
at the end of the 1800s,

00:00:29.394 --> 00:00:30.771
the United States comes roaring back.

00:00:30.771 --> 00:00:33.881
It becomes a major industrialized nation.

00:00:33.881 --> 00:00:35.971
And part of that industrializing process,

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.471
you have some gentlemen who become

00:00:38.472 --> 00:00:40.380
very, very, very wealthy.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.019
You have Cornelius Vanderbilt.

00:00:42.018 --> 00:00:44.979
His wealth was in the rail
and in the steamboats.

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:47.317
John D. Rockefeller known by some people

00:00:47.317 --> 00:00:53.060
as the wealthiest man in history.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.578
That may or may not be the case,

00:00:54.578 --> 00:00:56.407
but he was definitely the wealthiest man

00:00:56.406 --> 00:00:57.610
in American history.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.361
If you inflation-adjust
so some accounts will say

00:01:00.362 --> 00:01:02.102
he had 1.5 billion dollars.

00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:04.024
You might say, "Wait, I know of people

00:01:04.025 --> 00:01:06.415
"who have more than 1.5 billion dollars."

00:01:06.415 --> 00:01:08.887
If you inflation-adjust
the amount of money

00:01:08.887 --> 00:01:11.143
that John D. Rockefeller had at the turn

00:01:11.143 --> 00:01:13.846
of the century it comes out to 400 billion

00:01:13.846 --> 00:01:16.750
to 600 billion dollars.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.253
This is a lot more than
anyone that we know

00:01:19.253 --> 00:01:21.746
of in present times.

00:01:21.746 --> 00:01:24.054
You have Andrew Carnegie
in the steel business.

00:01:24.054 --> 00:01:27.379
His net worth, if you look at
it in a present value basis,

00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:29.023
is approximately 300 billion.

00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:31.429
You have people like JP Morgan.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.168
Although is net worth
also huge, huge amount,

00:01:34.168 --> 00:01:36.087
but where his power was really ....

00:01:36.087 --> 00:01:41.215
Since he was in control of the
financial world at that time,

00:01:41.215 --> 00:01:42.974
his financial power was tremendous.

00:01:42.974 --> 00:01:46.781
Maybe more than the type of power
that these gentleman could wield.

00:01:46.781 --> 00:01:50.408
The amount of power that
him and his associates

00:01:50.408 --> 00:01:53.706
controlled through their various holdings,

00:01:53.706 --> 00:01:57.602
some have said amounted
to the amount of wealth

00:01:57.602 --> 00:02:00.606
in all of the United States
West of the Mississippi.

00:02:00.606 --> 00:02:03.548
These are hugely powerful,
hugely wealthy men.

00:02:03.548 --> 00:02:04.933
The type of power and wealth that we

00:02:04.933 --> 00:02:07.890
actually have not seen since.

00:02:07.891 --> 00:02:10.155
You can decide what you
think of these people.

00:02:10.155 --> 00:02:13.408
On some level all of these people,

00:02:13.407 --> 00:02:14.992
I'm sure they were good entrepreneurs.

00:02:14.992 --> 00:02:16.709
I'm sure they were hard working,

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:17.631
I'm sure they innovated

00:02:17.631 --> 00:02:20.866
in their own way but they were also known

00:02:20.866 --> 00:02:24.169
for back then that this might be why it

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:26.558
would have given fuel to someone like Marx

00:02:26.558 --> 00:02:28.002
who would look at people
like this and say,

00:02:28.002 --> 00:02:30.310
"Look, these people have so much power.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.239
"Labor has no power compared to them.

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.003
"Some of the employees in some of these

00:02:35.003 --> 00:02:37.893
"companies, it's hard to
really say that they are

00:02:37.894 --> 00:02:39.057
"independent human beings.

00:02:39.056 --> 00:02:40.962
"They're almost like slave labor.

00:02:40.962 --> 00:02:43.367
"They live on the campus.
They have no rights.

00:02:43.367 --> 00:02:45.079
"People are dying while they're working

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.611
"for some of these organizations."

00:02:46.611 --> 00:02:48.437
So you can decide where you will,

00:02:48.437 --> 00:02:50.620
but the reality is that these people

00:02:50.621 --> 00:02:54.947
were hugely, hugely, hugely
wealthy, hugely powerful.

00:02:54.947 --> 00:02:58.094
Now you fast forward to the early 1900s

00:02:58.094 --> 00:03:00.274
and you start having a
little bit of a backlash

00:03:00.274 --> 00:03:04.199
against these ... I
guess the system in which

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:06.080
these type of people can thrive.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.468
You have Teddy Roosevelt
comes to power in 1901.

00:03:09.467 --> 00:03:11.569
One of the things ... He's
famous for many things,

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.686
but one of the things
he's famous for is being

00:03:13.687 --> 00:03:15.307
a trust buster.

00:03:15.306 --> 00:03:17.462
When he talks about trust,

00:03:17.462 --> 00:03:20.418
a trust is really just
a large corporation.

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:22.679
The idea is, is that, "Look Standard Oil,

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:24.500
"you have essentially taken control of the

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.132
"refining and the oil industry in America.

00:03:26.132 --> 00:03:27.473
"You have become a monopolist.

00:03:27.473 --> 00:03:28.696
"You need to be broken up."

00:03:28.695 --> 00:03:30.759
This is anti-competitive.

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:35.143
Remember, capitalism for the
capitalist sake, for capitalism sake

00:03:35.143 --> 00:03:36.058
is maybe not that good of an idea.

00:03:36.058 --> 00:03:37.242
What we want is competition.

00:03:37.242 --> 00:03:38.769
What we want is innovation.

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.673
What we want is incentives.

00:03:40.673 --> 00:03:43.110
If you control everything
and no one can compete

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.152
that's not helping anyone.

00:03:45.151 --> 00:03:49.286
So Teddy Roosevelt, it didn't
happen during his administration

00:03:49.286 --> 00:03:50.765
but he kind of started
the trust busting process,

00:03:50.764 --> 00:03:52.832
and in the next administration,

00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:54.640
in Taft's administration,

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.473
you actually have Standard
Oil being broken up.

00:03:57.473 --> 00:04:00.566
Just to get an idea of
how big Standard Oil was,

00:04:00.567 --> 00:04:03.539
if you take Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Conoco,

00:04:03.538 --> 00:04:07.960
and pretty much every
other major US oil company,

00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:09.802
put them together.

00:04:09.801 --> 00:04:11.944
I'm not saying it's the
equivalent of Standard Oil.

00:04:11.944 --> 00:04:14.042
That's actually what standard oil was.

00:04:14.042 --> 00:04:17.365
When Standard Oil was broken up
during Taft's administration,

00:04:17.365 --> 00:04:19.911
it was actually broken up into
all of these corporations.

00:04:19.911 --> 00:04:22.161
You can look into it more.

00:04:22.161 --> 00:04:25.040
You could imagine how much power
someone like that would hold.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.387
So the pendulum swung in one
extreme at the end of the 1800s.

00:04:28.387 --> 00:04:31.310
Roosevelt comes in, once
again Republican President,

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.973
Very strong President.

00:04:32.973 --> 00:04:34.052
But he said, "Look, enough is enough.

00:04:34.052 --> 00:04:35.740
"This is too much.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.276
"This is not in the best
interest of the American people.

00:04:37.276 --> 00:04:38.557
"We need competition."

00:04:38.557 --> 00:04:41.355
Then you fast forward even more.

00:04:41.355 --> 00:04:44.038
In the 20s you have this huge boom.

00:04:44.038 --> 00:04:44.942
Things are looking well.

00:04:44.942 --> 00:04:47.168
Whenever there is a boom,
people look the other way.

00:04:47.168 --> 00:04:48.778
People think, "Oh we don't
need much regulation.

00:04:48.778 --> 00:04:50.463
"We don't need much
government intervention."

00:04:50.463 --> 00:04:54.444
But then booms, many times,
almost always lead to busts.

00:04:54.444 --> 00:04:56.706
Then you have the Great Crash of 29,

00:04:56.706 --> 00:04:58.956
leads into the Great Depression.

00:04:58.956 --> 00:05:01.228
People are unhappy with Herbert Hoover.

00:05:01.228 --> 00:05:05.358
FDR comes into power in kind of the heart

00:05:05.358 --> 00:05:06.137
of the Great Depression.

00:05:06.137 --> 00:05:08.842
He stays President until World War 2.

00:05:08.843 --> 00:05:12.557
In his attempts to take the country
out of the Great Depression,

00:05:12.557 --> 00:05:14.987
he has this New Deal set of programs.

00:05:14.987 --> 00:05:17.964
Some of the New Deal
programs were essentially

00:05:17.964 --> 00:05:19.929
to make use of all the
labor and industrial

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.903
capacity that was going unused
during the Great Depression.

00:05:23.903 --> 00:05:25.748
It was kind of this Keynesian Philosophy

00:05:25.747 --> 00:05:28.158
that if no one else is going to supply

00:05:28.158 --> 00:05:29.890
the demand to use all of these factories

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:31.798
and use all of these
people, the government will.

00:05:31.798 --> 00:05:33.973
There were these huge
public works projects

00:05:33.973 --> 00:05:35.789
but there was also
regulation getting involved

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.354
here to kind of stop
some of the things that

00:05:39.353 --> 00:05:41.284
were perceived caused
the boom and the bust.

00:05:41.285 --> 00:05:43.546
You have the Glass Steagall Act,

00:05:43.545 --> 00:05:47.223
which is most famous for
separating investment

00:05:47.223 --> 00:05:49.726
banking from depository institutions.

00:05:49.726 --> 00:05:51.581
Essentially saying the
same people who are taking

00:05:51.581 --> 00:05:53.183
your deposits can't on the other side take

00:05:53.184 --> 00:05:56.020
your deposits and gamble with
them in the stock market.

00:05:56.019 --> 00:05:58.791
This is when Social Security passed,

00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:00.735
once again providing a safety net,

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:02.137
going slightly in the Socialist direction.

00:06:02.137 --> 00:06:06.305
Saying, "Hey look, we can't have,
if we're a civilized, rich country,

00:06:06.305 --> 00:06:07.399
"we can't have people going
hungry in the streets.

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:10.971
"We can't have older people who have done

00:06:10.971 --> 00:06:13.139
"their work, who have
contributed to society,

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:14.625
"now all of the sudden
that we're in the middle

00:06:14.625 --> 00:06:16.496
"of a depression, we can't
have them starving to death.

00:06:16.497 --> 00:06:18.881
"Or not having them at
least having a basic

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:19.975
"level of existence."

00:06:19.975 --> 00:06:21.262
You have Social Security.

00:06:21.262 --> 00:06:23.533
Safety net is coming into play.

00:06:23.533 --> 00:06:25.874
You have Fannie Mae being created,

00:06:25.874 --> 00:06:28.227
which the Fannie Mae narrative plays

00:06:28.226 --> 00:06:32.500
all the way into 2008 and
continues to be a part

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.006
of the story with the
American housing situation.

00:06:36.007 --> 00:06:39.425
What this is, is an
organization that essentially

00:06:39.425 --> 00:06:42.242
can buy mortgages. Buying mortgages is

00:06:42.242 --> 00:06:45.134
it's essentially lending
money to people for mortgages.

00:06:45.134 --> 00:06:47.151
The reason why the government did this,

00:06:47.151 --> 00:06:49.783
is the government ... This
is a separate organization

00:06:49.783 --> 00:06:52.042
that implicitly had the
backing of the government,

00:06:52.041 --> 00:06:54.116
which says that Fannie
Mae can borrow from people

00:06:54.117 --> 00:06:56.689
but if for whatever
reason one day Fannie Mae

00:06:56.689 --> 00:07:00.122
can't pay back its loans, the
government will back it up.

00:07:00.122 --> 00:07:02.045
It will make good on those loans.

00:07:02.045 --> 00:07:05.543
What that allowed Fannie
Mae to do is to borrow money

00:07:05.543 --> 00:07:07.261
at very low interest rates,

00:07:07.261 --> 00:07:09.128
essentially close to the
rate that the US government

00:07:09.127 --> 00:07:11.235
could borrow at and then loan that money

00:07:11.235 --> 00:07:14.314
at very low interest rates to
people who want to buy houses.

00:07:14.314 --> 00:07:19.425
So essentially subsidized home ownership.

00:07:19.425 --> 00:07:20.949
I should say not home ownership.

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:22.822
Subsidized home borrowing.

00:07:22.822 --> 00:07:25.245
I want to make that
clear because if everyone

00:07:25.245 --> 00:07:28.415
now has more borrowing
power to buy a home,

00:07:28.415 --> 00:07:30.362
then most likely that will just increase

00:07:30.362 --> 00:07:32.086
the price of houses.

00:07:32.086 --> 00:07:34.107
So it's really not
subsidizing home borrowing

00:07:34.107 --> 00:07:35.697
but that's a whole other topic.

00:07:35.697 --> 00:07:38.054
Once again the government
is getting involved.

00:07:38.053 --> 00:07:40.641
Here they're trying to do a
little bit of engineering.

00:07:40.641 --> 00:07:44.005
Once again this goes against
letting the market do its thing.

00:07:44.005 --> 00:07:47.100
This is a distortion in the market.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.168
It's a distortion because once again

00:07:49.168 --> 00:07:50.614
it's anti-competitive.

00:07:50.613 --> 00:07:52.463
If someone else wanted
to do what Fannie Mae

00:07:52.463 --> 00:07:54.103
did but didn't have the
backing of the government

00:07:54.103 --> 00:07:56.283
it wouldn't be able to
compete because it wouldn't

00:07:56.283 --> 00:07:58.213
be able to borrow money as cheaply.

00:07:58.213 --> 00:08:00.218
You keep fast forwarding.

00:08:00.218 --> 00:08:02.122
You get to Lyndon
Johnson's Administration.

00:08:02.122 --> 00:08:04.580
Obviously there were
other people in between.

00:08:04.579 --> 00:08:06.562
You get to Lyndon Johnson's administration

00:08:06.562 --> 00:08:07.850
and you have the Great Society.

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:11.066
The Great Society, amongst other things,

00:08:11.065 --> 00:08:14.041
food stamps, war on
poverty, Medicare, Medicaid,

00:08:14.041 --> 00:08:16.908
so once again saying, "Hey society needs

00:08:16.908 --> 00:08:19.447
"to have some base level
of support for people."

00:08:19.447 --> 00:08:22.026
I'm not going to take
sides one way or the other

00:08:22.026 --> 00:08:24.135
but the pendulum was definitely swinging

00:08:24.136 --> 00:08:28.035
in the direction of
more social safety nets

00:08:28.035 --> 00:08:31.499
and more attempts to make kind of a level

00:08:31.499 --> 00:08:33.139
playing field and you can debate whether

00:08:33.139 --> 00:08:35.091
they were successful or not.

00:08:35.091 --> 00:08:35.890
The other thing,

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.379
and this is completely unrelated
to what this conversation

00:08:38.379 --> 00:08:40.231
is about but whenever someone learns about

00:08:40.231 --> 00:08:42.101
Teddy Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt

00:08:42.101 --> 00:08:44.654
in the same video it begs the question,

00:08:44.654 --> 00:08:46.362
"Were they related in some way?"

00:08:46.363 --> 00:08:49.111
It does turn out they were fifth cousins.

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:51.460
Even more interesting, Eleanor Roosevelt,

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.019
who was Franklin Roosevelt's wife,

00:08:53.019 --> 00:08:54.697
was Teddy Roosevelt's niece.

00:08:54.697 --> 00:08:57.658
There actually was a
pretty close relationship

00:08:57.658 --> 00:08:59.687
between all of these Roosevelt's.

00:08:59.687 --> 00:09:01.287
Another interesting thing,

00:09:01.287 --> 00:09:03.243
I just found this on the Internet,

00:09:03.243 --> 00:09:05.276
Teddy Roosevelt was
also the first President

00:09:05.275 --> 00:09:07.381
to ride in the open in an automobile.

00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:09.017
It's funny to see the
secret service agents

00:09:09.018 --> 00:09:11.372
over here riding bicycles to keep up.

00:09:11.371 --> 00:09:13.265
Anyway, complete tangent.

00:09:13.265 --> 00:09:15.486
So you had, just to review where we are.

00:09:15.486 --> 00:09:18.745
End of 1800s you have what some people

00:09:18.745 --> 00:09:21.534
have called, if they want to
be insulting of these people,

00:09:21.534 --> 00:09:23.673
the robber barrons.

00:09:23.673 --> 00:09:26.195
They have concentrated
a huge amount of wealth.

00:09:26.195 --> 00:09:28.091
Then the pendulum starts swinging back

00:09:28.091 --> 00:09:31.995
with Teddy Roosevelt, Franklin
Roosevelt and then Lyndon Johnson.

00:09:31.995 --> 00:09:35.172
Then you fast forward even through the 70s

00:09:35.172 --> 00:09:38.045
you still have kind of a fairly heavy

00:09:38.044 --> 00:09:40.134
regulation of many industries in the US.

00:09:40.134 --> 00:09:42.349
Jimmy Carter, who was
considered quite liberal,

00:09:42.349 --> 00:09:45.149
you have to give him, if
you are anti-regulation,

00:09:45.149 --> 00:09:46.337
give him some credit.

00:09:46.337 --> 00:09:47.752
He actually deregulated
the airline industry

00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:51.556
and frankly that's why it's
hard ... that's why airline

00:09:51.556 --> 00:09:54.067
tickets are actually fairly inexpensive

00:09:54.067 --> 00:09:55.816
if you look at them on an
inflation-adjusted basis.

00:09:55.816 --> 00:09:59.024
Then the pendulum swings
back again into less

00:09:59.024 --> 00:10:02.432
government, less regulation
under Ronald Reagan.

00:10:02.432 --> 00:10:05.396
This is Ronald Reagan here.

00:10:05.395 --> 00:10:08.070
He is kind of most known
amongst other things,

00:10:08.071 --> 00:10:10.465
I mean, some people think that he brought

00:10:10.465 --> 00:10:14.062
communism to the brink but he also was big

00:10:14.062 --> 00:10:18.134
on less government.

00:10:18.134 --> 00:10:21.139
From the story of the 1900s until then

00:10:21.139 --> 00:10:22.378
was kind of more and more regulation,

00:10:22.378 --> 00:10:23.932
more safety nets, more government,

00:10:23.932 --> 00:10:25.596
and then Ronald Reagan comes

00:10:25.596 --> 00:10:27.667
with less government and lower taxes,

00:10:27.667 --> 00:10:29.742
although he spent a ton on the military,

00:10:29.741 --> 00:10:31.875
and the military is government.

00:10:31.875 --> 00:10:34.551
What's interesting is in
this period during the 80s

00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:36.954
you start having an economic boom.

00:10:36.953 --> 00:10:38.533
You could debate whether
it's due to Ronald Reagan,

00:10:38.533 --> 00:10:40.462
or maybe it was due to things that

00:10:40.462 --> 00:10:42.424
were completely out of his control.

00:10:42.424 --> 00:10:44.103
Maybe it was due to
automation and information

00:10:44.104 --> 00:10:46.566
technology starts becoming big and he

00:10:46.566 --> 00:10:48.317
has nothing to do with
that but regardless to say,

00:10:48.317 --> 00:10:51.274
you do start having an
economic boom in the 80s.

00:10:51.274 --> 00:10:53.869
Then the 90s it starts to
accelerate under Bill Clinton.

00:10:53.869 --> 00:10:55.878
The interesting thing that
you see is when things

00:10:55.878 --> 00:10:57.801
are good the temptation
for government to regulate

00:10:57.801 --> 00:11:00.287
goes down and under Bill Clinton,

00:11:00.287 --> 00:11:02.240
who is a democratic, considered liberal,

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:06.973
you have Welfare Reform,

00:11:06.974 --> 00:11:10.698
which does undo a lot of ...

00:11:10.697 --> 00:11:13.928
I guess it takes a more
conservative take on welfare.

00:11:13.928 --> 00:11:18.028
It makes it harder to have welfare
for longer periods of time.

00:11:18.028 --> 00:11:21.330
You also have the repeal
of Glass Steagall,

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:26.033
so the repeal of Glass Steagall.

00:11:26.033 --> 00:11:30.999
So even though Bill Clinton
was considered liberal,

00:11:30.999 --> 00:11:32.486
maybe he would blame
these things on having

00:11:32.486 --> 00:11:35.264
a republican congress,
who forced him into it,

00:11:35.264 --> 00:11:36.373
or whatever else.

00:11:36.373 --> 00:11:39.550
The reality is it did happen
under his administration.

00:11:39.549 --> 00:11:41.966
The government stepping
out of welfare a little bit

00:11:41.966 --> 00:11:46.073
and allowing to or kind of
a deregulation of banks.

00:11:46.073 --> 00:11:48.091
Allowing for investment banking

00:11:48.091 --> 00:11:50.860
and commercial banking to
start getting comingled again.

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:52.870
Then you keep forwarding through the Bush

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:54.419
Administration once George W. Bush,

00:11:54.419 --> 00:11:58.070
I could put his dad in here in between.

00:11:58.071 --> 00:11:59.548
Actually he was forced to raise taxes

00:11:59.548 --> 00:12:02.008
so I can't really include him in the

00:12:02.008 --> 00:12:03.459
conversation of less government,

00:12:03.458 --> 00:12:04.780
and he would claim he
was forced to do that

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.995
because of democrats.

00:12:06.995 --> 00:12:08.629
All the way through all
of these presidencies,

00:12:08.629 --> 00:12:10.292
while things were kind
of on this upward march,

00:12:10.292 --> 00:12:13.447
you had this constant
stream of deregulation

00:12:13.447 --> 00:12:18.269
and all the way until you get to 2008.

00:12:18.269 --> 00:12:21.084
You have a major, major financial crisis.

00:12:21.083 --> 00:12:23.058
Who knows, now sitting in 2011,

00:12:23.058 --> 00:12:24.850
where that pendulum will swing back,

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:27.327
but there is a sense that maybe all

00:12:27.327 --> 00:12:29.817
of this went too far
and probably the worst

00:12:29.817 --> 00:12:32.675
signs of this is this
whole idea that emerged

00:12:32.676 --> 00:12:38.680
during the 2008 crisis of Too Big To Fail.

00:12:38.679 --> 00:12:44.068
Which is kind of the worst
of Capitalism and Socialism.

00:12:44.068 --> 00:12:46.062
It's kind of like corporate welfare.

00:12:46.062 --> 00:12:50.860
It's like, not only are you
not giving benefit to those

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.264
who want to innovate or do well,

00:12:53.264 --> 00:12:56.999
you have these huge entities that control

00:12:56.999 --> 00:12:58.754
so much wealth, that control
so much of the economy,

00:12:58.754 --> 00:13:01.158
and they get there by taking huge amounts

00:13:01.158 --> 00:13:03.889
of risks and as soon
as they do incompetent

00:13:03.889 --> 00:13:05.928
stupid things that put all of us at risk,

00:13:05.928 --> 00:13:08.836
the government comes in to bail them out

00:13:08.836 --> 00:13:12.274
because essentially they are
holding the economy hostage.

00:13:12.274 --> 00:13:14.783
If the government does
not bail these characters

00:13:14.783 --> 00:13:17.026
out they might take the
entire economy with them.

00:13:17.025 --> 00:13:18.362
My sense is that they tried to scare

00:13:18.363 --> 00:13:20.564
the government a little
bit more to have the

00:13:20.563 --> 00:13:22.889
government believe that
so they do get bailed.

00:13:22.889 --> 00:13:27.611
Regardless to say, it does
leave kind of a moment in time

00:13:27.611 --> 00:13:29.429
where society, or at
least American society,

00:13:29.429 --> 00:13:30.967
really the world,

00:13:30.967 --> 00:13:33.506
has to question how much
regulation is appropriate?

00:13:33.506 --> 00:13:37.561
How much control over the financial system

00:13:37.562 --> 00:13:40.539
should private institutions
be allowed to have?

00:13:40.539 --> 00:13:42.670
Fannie Mae is an interesting one.

00:13:42.671 --> 00:13:45.909
Because once again it's
a government sponsored

00:13:45.908 --> 00:13:47.784
institution that was pseudo-private.

00:13:47.784 --> 00:13:50.134
It was kind of the worst of both worlds.

00:13:50.134 --> 00:13:52.009
Once again it's still being propped up

00:13:52.009 --> 00:13:55.351
by the government and
it's a major distortion.

00:13:55.351 --> 00:13:57.637
It's a major distortion
market but to some degree the

00:13:57.638 --> 00:14:00.485
government is afraid of
letting it completely falter

00:14:00.485 --> 00:14:02.049
now because it would probably tank

00:14:02.049 --> 00:14:04.152
the economy to some degree.

00:14:04.153 --> 00:14:06.351
Anyway, hopefully you
found that interesting.

00:14:06.351 --> 00:14:07.959
I just wanted to give you some perspective

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.670
on the swinging of the pendulum between

00:14:09.669 --> 00:14:14.387
government regulation and
more kind of capitalism

00:14:14.388 --> 00:14:17.402
without regulation that we've
seen in the United States

00:14:17.402 --> 00:14:21.000
over roughly the last 100 or so years.
