00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:14.440
Paint, in some form, has existed since prehistoric
times.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.800
Some of the earliest forms of paint came from
mixing together dirt, ash, and organic materials

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.380
with animal blood and oil.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.199
While the practice of painting the exterior
of various structures has been around for

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:30.340
some unclear amount of time since, not everyone
was on board with this in relatively recent

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.340
times.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.610
For instance, certain early American settlers
declared the act of painting the outside of

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.820
houses a sign of immodesty, wealth and vanity.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.570
Depending on how puritanical a community was,
painting a house might have even landed a

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.250
person in legal trouble.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.540
For farmers and their barns in certain regions,
this same mentality applied.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.400
A painted barn was a sign of extravagance
and since the main function of paint at the

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.500
time was merely to add color to a structure
or room, farmers didn’t see much point in

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.010
spending money to make their barns pretty.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.760
So how did they preserve the wood of their
buildings without proper sealants?

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.360
Prior to the 19th century, the preservative
philosophy many farmers believed in was, “The

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.270
right wood in the right place needed no paint.”

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.200
Part of the process of deciding on a location
to build a barn was based on a farmer’s

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.399
careful assessment of the wind, sun, and water
exposure the wood exterior would endure through

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:22.399
the years.

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.939
This tried and true method, combined with
plentiful, naturally weather resistance heartwood,

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.820
made many barns quite durable despite their
exteriors remaining au naturel.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.749
As years passed, however, the practice of
weather assessment fell to the wayside, with

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:40.420
farmers dabbling in more convenient and longer
lasting solutions to protect their barns from

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.420
the elements.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.049
Various homemade concoctions towards this
end were made, with a popular base in these

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:46.130
being linseed oil.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.090
To strengthen the oil and help it dry and
harden quickly, it soon became common to mix

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.740
it with milk and lime or turpentine, creating
something of a burnt-orange color weather

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.740
treating paint.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.789
iron-oxideWhile this mixture sealed wood from
moisture somewhat, it did not inhibit the

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.329
growth of mold and moss that plagued wooden
structures.

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:06.880
For the solution to this, iron oxide, otherwise
known as rust, was also added to the homemade

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.880
paint.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.070
Iron oxide could be found in abundance in
the soil on farms in the eastern United States,

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.410
among other places, which made it literally
dirt-cheap and easy to obtain.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.670
Depending on the exact soil composition and
amount of iron oxide used for a particular

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.490
homemade batch of the paint, it would take
on anywhere from the aforementioned burnt-orange

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.930
color to dark red-brown.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.890
When such paint became cheaply available via
mass production in the late 1800s, farmers

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.110
often stuck with the color red because, thanks
to the abundance of iron oxide, red paint

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.690
was still generally the cheapest paint on
the shelf (although this is certainly not

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:41.740
the case today).

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.690
As for why barns are still often painted red
(albeit generally much brighter reds than

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.680
the classic red-brown) despite no real inherent
cost savings anymore, this is just down to

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.210
tradition.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.270
The word “barn” originated from the Old
English words “bere” and “aern.”

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.240
“Bere” means barley or grain and “aern”
describes a storage place, so barn essentially

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:16.930
mean a storage place

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:17.010
for grain.
