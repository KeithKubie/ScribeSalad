00:00:06.774 --> 00:00:09.685
This is the Bop.

00:00:09.685 --> 00:00:15.494
The Bop is a type of social dance.

00:00:15.494 --> 00:00:17.155
Dance is a language,

00:00:17.155 --> 00:00:21.565
and social dance is an expression
that emerges from a community.

00:00:21.565 --> 00:00:24.995
A social dance isn't choreographed
by any one person.

00:00:24.995 --> 00:00:27.644
It can't be traced to any one moment.

00:00:27.644 --> 00:00:30.575
Each dance has steps
that everyone can agree on,

00:00:30.575 --> 00:00:36.086
but it's about the individual
and their creative identity.

00:00:36.086 --> 00:00:37.005
Because of that,

00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:38.725
social dances bubble up,

00:00:38.725 --> 00:00:39.715
they change,

00:00:39.715 --> 00:00:43.456
and they spread like wildfire.

00:00:43.456 --> 00:00:47.655
They are as old as our remembered history.

00:00:47.655 --> 00:00:50.166
In African-American social dances,

00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.606
we see over 200 years

00:00:51.606 --> 00:00:58.616
of how African and African-American
traditions influenced our history.

00:00:58.616 --> 00:01:01.857
The present always contains the past.

00:01:01.857 --> 00:01:03.926
And the past shapes who we are

00:01:03.926 --> 00:01:05.675
and who we will be.

00:01:05.675 --> 00:01:09.780
(Clapping)

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.736
The Juba dance was born
from enslaved Africans' experience

00:01:12.736 --> 00:01:14.793
on the plantation.

00:01:14.793 --> 00:01:16.007
Brought to the Americas,

00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:18.186
stripped of a common spoken language,

00:01:18.186 --> 00:01:22.558
this dance was a way for enslaved Africans
to remember where they're from.

00:01:22.558 --> 00:01:31.007
It may have looked something like this.

00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:32.175
Slapping thighs,

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:33.347
shuffling feet

00:01:33.347 --> 00:01:35.267
and patting hands:

00:01:35.267 --> 00:01:39.537
this was how they got around
the slave owners' ban on drumming,

00:01:39.537 --> 00:01:41.286
improvising complex rhythms

00:01:41.286 --> 00:01:44.166
just like ancestors did
with drums in Haiti

00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:51.276
or in the Yoruba communities
of West Africa.

00:01:51.276 --> 00:01:54.099
It was about keeping
cultural traditions alive

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:56.292
and retaining a sense of inner freedom

00:01:56.292 --> 00:01:59.396
under captivity.

00:01:59.396 --> 00:02:04.627
It was the same subversive spirit
that created this dance:

00:02:04.627 --> 00:02:05.847
the Cakewalk,

00:02:05.847 --> 00:02:09.656
a dance that parodied the mannerisms
of Southern high society --

00:02:09.656 --> 00:02:13.260
a way for the enslaved
to throw shade at the masters.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.029
The crazy thing about this dance

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:18.268
is that the Cakewalk
was performed for the masters,

00:02:18.268 --> 00:02:23.398
who never suspected
they were being made fun of.

00:02:23.398 --> 00:02:25.848
Now you might recognize this one.

00:02:25.848 --> 00:02:27.281
1920s --

00:02:27.281 --> 00:02:32.262
the Charleston.

00:02:32.262 --> 00:02:35.726
The Charleston was all about
improvisation and musicality,

00:02:35.726 --> 00:02:38.019
making its way into Lindy Hop,

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:38.979
swing dancing

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:40.689
and even the Kid n Play,

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:47.670
originally called the Funky Charleston.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.681
Started by a tight-knit Black community
near Charleston, South Carolina,

00:02:51.681 --> 00:02:53.740
the Charleston permeated dance halls

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.681
where young women suddenly had
the freedom to kick their heels

00:02:56.681 --> 00:03:03.600
and move their legs.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.310
Now, social dance is about
community and connection;

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.580
if you knew the steps,

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.730
it meant you belonged to a group.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.679
But what if it becomes a worldwide craze?

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:15.260
Enter the Twist.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.319
It's no surprise that the Twist
can be traced back to the 19th century,

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.511
brought to America from the Congo

00:03:21.511 --> 00:03:23.461
during slavery.

00:03:23.461 --> 00:03:24.542
But in the late '50s,

00:03:24.542 --> 00:03:26.561
right before the Civil Rights Movement,

00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:30.351
the Twist is popularized
by Chubby Checker and Dick Clark.

00:03:30.351 --> 00:03:32.781
Suddenly, everybody's doing the Twist:

00:03:32.781 --> 00:03:33.971
white teenagers,

00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:35.563
kids in Latin America,

00:03:35.563 --> 00:03:38.542
making its way into songs and movies.

00:03:38.542 --> 00:03:39.571
Through social dance,

00:03:39.571 --> 00:03:45.701
the boundaries between groups
become blurred.

00:03:45.701 --> 00:03:49.231
The story continues in the 1980s and '90s.

00:03:49.231 --> 00:03:51.512
Along with the emergence of hip-hop,

00:03:51.512 --> 00:03:55.363
African-American social dance
took on even more visibility,

00:03:55.363 --> 00:03:57.771
borrowing from its long past,

00:03:57.771 --> 00:04:08.891
shaping culture and being shaped by it.

00:04:08.891 --> 00:04:14.113
Today, these dances continue
to evolve, grow and spread.

00:04:14.113 --> 00:04:16.013
Why do we dance?

00:04:16.013 --> 00:04:17.062
To move,

00:04:17.062 --> 00:04:18.322
to let loose,

00:04:18.322 --> 00:04:19.793
to express.

00:04:19.793 --> 00:04:21.643
Why do we dance together?

00:04:21.643 --> 00:04:22.563
To heal,

00:04:22.563 --> 00:04:23.773
to remember,

00:04:23.773 --> 00:04:26.314
to say: "We speak a common language.

00:04:26.314 --> 00:04:27.394
We exist

00:04:27.394 --> 00:04:29.504
and we are free."
