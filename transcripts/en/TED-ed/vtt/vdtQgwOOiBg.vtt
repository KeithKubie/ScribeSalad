00:00:14.332 --> 00:00:15.624
Worst case scenario:

00:00:15.624 --> 00:00:18.177
zombie apocalypse.

00:00:18.177 --> 00:00:19.709
How will you survive?

00:00:19.709 --> 00:00:21.212
You might be surprised to find out

00:00:21.212 --> 00:00:24.935
how much geography skills can help you fend off doom.

00:00:24.935 --> 00:00:28.930
By geography, I mean analyzing the world around you.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.273
One geographic concept that could really help you out

00:00:31.273 --> 00:00:33.645
in a zombie apocalypse is movement.

00:00:33.645 --> 00:00:36.357
So, first, what moves?

00:00:36.357 --> 00:00:37.348
People move,

00:00:37.348 --> 00:00:38.692
animals move,

00:00:38.692 --> 00:00:40.274
and, while sometimes slowly,

00:00:40.274 --> 00:00:42.852
zombies move as well.

00:00:42.852 --> 00:00:44.029
But that's not all.

00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:45.542
Goods move, too.

00:00:45.542 --> 00:00:46.949
Goods can be resources,

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:48.158
such as food supplies

00:00:48.158 --> 00:00:49.285
and weapons.

00:00:49.285 --> 00:00:51.960
People or zombies tend to move these.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.158
So, if you see a big pile of zombie supplies

00:00:54.158 --> 00:00:55.956
where there wasn't one before,

00:00:55.956 --> 00:00:57.840
you're probably on the trail.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.633
Ideas also move.

00:00:59.633 --> 00:01:01.885
Ideas can include entertainment,

00:01:01.885 --> 00:01:02.986
zombie movies,

00:01:02.986 --> 00:01:04.726
news and information

00:01:04.726 --> 00:01:06.842
about zombie attacks,

00:01:06.842 --> 00:01:08.309
and architecture,

00:01:08.309 --> 00:01:10.852
or how to build a safe shelter.

00:01:10.852 --> 00:01:14.021
And, second, why do people or zombies move?

00:01:14.021 --> 00:01:15.954
When people, animals, or zombies move,

00:01:15.954 --> 00:01:17.375
it's called migration.

00:01:17.375 --> 00:01:18.941
Two concepts that affect migration

00:01:18.941 --> 00:01:21.281
are push and pull factors.

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:24.395
Push factors will make you want to leave somewhere.

00:01:24.395 --> 00:01:27.171
Pull factors make you want to go to a place.

00:01:27.171 --> 00:01:28.575
A lack of resources,

00:01:28.575 --> 00:01:29.794
unstable economy,

00:01:29.794 --> 00:01:30.669
or high crime rate

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:33.584
might be push factors making people want to move.

00:01:33.584 --> 00:01:34.669
Nice weather,

00:01:34.669 --> 00:01:35.459
a good economy,

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:37.089
or lots of resources

00:01:37.089 --> 00:01:39.465
would be pull factors for lots of people,

00:01:39.465 --> 00:01:41.135
enticing them to move.

00:01:41.135 --> 00:01:43.679
While zombies are definitely a push factor for humans,

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:46.617
a city full of people would be a pull factor for

00:01:46.617 --> 00:01:50.659
hungry zombies who want to eat humans.

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.060
There are some things that make movement

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.187
easier for people or zombies.

00:01:54.187 --> 00:01:56.902
Waterways and highways can make traveling faster.

00:01:56.902 --> 00:01:58.983
Moving across clear, open space

00:01:58.983 --> 00:02:01.334
is easier than a tough terrain.

00:02:01.334 --> 00:02:03.475
And just as land forms can create boundaries

00:02:03.475 --> 00:02:04.827
that affect movement,

00:02:04.827 --> 00:02:06.450
so can political boundaries,

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.452
like a border gate, for example.

00:02:08.452 --> 00:02:10.883
So, how can you analyze these movement factors

00:02:10.883 --> 00:02:12.869
to help your chance of survival?

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:14.861
There are three basic steps.

00:02:14.861 --> 00:02:19.627
One - identify the points or locations to analyze.

00:02:19.627 --> 00:02:21.474
What are your options?

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:24.003
Two - find what connects them.

00:02:24.003 --> 00:02:27.048
Are there highways, waterways, or open land?

00:02:27.048 --> 00:02:30.059
And three - find the patterns of movement

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:32.392
that happen over that connection.

00:02:32.392 --> 00:02:34.813
Do people or goods move across it?

00:02:34.813 --> 00:02:37.406
By comparing relationships between different places,

00:02:37.406 --> 00:02:39.942
you can see what connections they have.

00:02:39.942 --> 00:02:42.245
For example, pick two cities.

00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:43.904
Look at the highway connecting them.

00:02:43.904 --> 00:02:46.533
If people use that highway to commute to work,

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:49.368
those cities have a strong relationship.

00:02:49.368 --> 00:02:50.872
But this other city over here

00:02:50.872 --> 00:02:53.456
doesn't have a direct connection to the other cities.

00:02:53.456 --> 00:02:55.416
There's even a river in the way.

00:02:55.416 --> 00:02:58.002
It doesn't have as strong of a relationship.

00:02:58.002 --> 00:03:02.380
If a zombie outbreak started here,

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.634
which city would you rather start out in?

00:03:04.634 --> 00:03:06.375
Where would you flee to?

00:03:06.375 --> 00:03:10.007
So, how do you decide where to go in a zombie apocalypse?

00:03:10.007 --> 00:03:12.641
Do you just run in a random direction?

00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:14.416
Or do you use your geographic skills

00:03:14.416 --> 00:03:17.020
to lead your camp of survivors to safety?

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.736
If you want to stay alive,

00:03:18.736 --> 00:03:22.141
it helps to understand how and why we move.
