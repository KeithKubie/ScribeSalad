- [Voiceover] Let y of x
equal to the cube, be equal

00:00:03.151 --> 00:00:05.960
to the cube root of x to the 3rd plus one.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.666
Which of the following is equivalent

00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:10.302
to y of y of x?

00:00:10.302 --> 00:00:12.403
Alright, this is gonna be fun.

00:00:12.403 --> 00:00:16.269
So we know that y of
x, y of x, is equal to

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:19.519
the cube root of x to the 3rd plus one.

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:24.266
Which of the following is
equivalent to y of y of x?

00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:27.264
Well, to evaluate y of y of x,

00:00:27.264 --> 00:00:32.264
y of y of y of x,

00:00:32.326 --> 00:00:34.264
everywhere where we see an extra,

00:00:34.264 --> 00:00:38.150
we would just replace it with a y of x.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.631
It's kind of confusing, it might seem

00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:42.135
a little bit daunting cause
it's referring to itself,

00:00:42.135 --> 00:00:45.130
but it should all make sense in the end.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.031
So we're gonna have something
to the 3rd power plus one,

00:00:49.031 --> 00:00:54.031
and in this case that
something is y of x, y of x.

00:00:54.255 --> 00:00:56.275
So what's y of x equal to?

00:00:56.275 --> 00:00:58.399
Well it's equal to all of this business.

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.750
So let me write this down, so
this is going to be equal to

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.726
this is going to be equal
to, the cube root of,

00:01:06.726 --> 00:01:10.368
the cube root of, give myself some space,

00:01:10.368 --> 00:01:13.969
so y of x is

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:17.044
the cube root of

00:01:17.044 --> 00:01:20.282
x to the 3rd plus one,

00:01:20.282 --> 00:01:23.765
now we're going to raise
that to the 3rd power.

00:01:23.765 --> 00:01:26.574
We're gonna raise that to
the 3rd power, plus one.

00:01:26.574 --> 00:01:28.954
And so we just have to evaluate this.

00:01:28.954 --> 00:01:30.777
So what is this going to be?

00:01:30.777 --> 00:01:34.826
Well, this is going to be the cube root,

00:01:34.826 --> 00:01:38.755
the cube root of, well, what
we have right over here,

00:01:38.755 --> 00:01:40.740
if I have to take the
cube root of something,

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.911
but then I raise it to the 3rd power,

00:01:42.911 --> 00:01:44.420
this is like raising something to the 1/3,

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.929
and then raising that to the 3rd.

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:48.135
Well that's just gonna give me this thing,

00:01:48.135 --> 00:01:50.573
all of this business right over here,

00:01:50.573 --> 00:01:55.332
is just going to evaluate
to x to the 3rd plus one.

00:01:55.332 --> 00:01:59.256
Once again, if I just take
the cube root of something,

00:01:59.256 --> 00:02:01.799
of whatever this is and then
raise that to the 3rd power,

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.875
that's going to be this
original something.

00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:07.615
Maybe I should put a,
if I take the cube root

00:02:07.615 --> 00:02:10.227
of a, and if I raise it to the 3rd power,

00:02:10.227 --> 00:02:12.316
that's just going to be a here.

00:02:12.316 --> 00:02:13.930
That's all I did right over here.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.577
The cube root of x to the 3rd
plus one to the 3rd power,

00:02:16.577 --> 00:02:18.748
is just gonna be x to the 3rd plus one.

00:02:18.748 --> 00:02:22.114
And then now, we have the plus one,

00:02:22.114 --> 00:02:26.189
so this is going to be
equal to the cube root

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:30.590
of x to the 3rd plus two,

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.471
x to the 3rd plus two,

00:02:32.471 --> 00:02:36.664
which is that choice right over there.
