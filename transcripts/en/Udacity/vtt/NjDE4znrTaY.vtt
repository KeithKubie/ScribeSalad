00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.020
David, what did you write?

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.710
&gt;&gt; So starting at the beginning, has
wings becomes the predicate has wings.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.100
We're doing a conjunction so
and, does not have fur, so

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.760
not has fur,
those two things imply that it's a bird.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.110
&gt;&gt; That's good, David.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.600
Now, let us put this in a form,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.000
in a conjunctive normal form that we
can use in resolution theorem proving.
