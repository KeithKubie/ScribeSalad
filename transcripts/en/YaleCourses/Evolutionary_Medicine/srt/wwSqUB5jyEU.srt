1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:06,150
Cancer is not only a micro evolutionary
process as with standard biological

2
00:00:06,151 --> 00:00:06,984
evolution,

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,300
micro evolution is a process that produces
a pattern macro evolution that we can

4
00:00:12,301 --> 00:00:14,250
study with molecular filing genetics.

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:20,760
It turns out that the evolutionary history
of individual cancers is longer than

6
00:00:20,761 --> 00:00:21,720
we had anticipated.

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,490
Cancer fight [inaudible] do
reveal some convergent evolution.

8
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,930
The heterogeneity revealed by phylogenies
is also pointing to problems for

9
00:00:33,751 --> 00:00:36,060
therapies that are
targeted to single samples.

10
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:37,910
Yeah,

11
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,540
well I could or file a geography of
brain tumors shows that multiple clones

12
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,720
survive chemotherapy and that are
occupying different positions.

13
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,690
And this also points to
the complexity of therapy.

14
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,520
Analysis of phylogenetic trees of cancers
revealed that therapy with NSA ids,

15
00:00:55,881 --> 00:01:00,881
nonsteroidal inflammatory drugs reduced
the rate of acquisition of somatic

16
00:01:02,091 --> 00:01:05,960
mutations and that suggests
why Nsa ids reduce cancer risk.

17
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,330
We'll step through this.

18
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,870
Here is one study of a number of
patients who had pancreatic cancer.

19
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:20,730
And what you see here is a phylogenetic
tree sketched out running, uh,

20
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,210
from old to young,
from top to bottom.

21
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,550
It starts with a normal epithelial
cell in a doc in the pancreas.

22
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,360
Tumor cells starts with a mutation.

23
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:37,780
There was a process of clonal evolution
in which the dark blue clones were

24
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:42,380
eliminated by competition that
results in a parental clone.

25
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:47,440
What they mean here is parental for
the metastasis yields down a set of sub

26
00:01:48,521 --> 00:01:53,521
clones that have metastatic capacity and
they then go out from the pancreas and

27
00:01:54,771 --> 00:01:57,950
were recovered when the
patients died in lung and liver.

28
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,310
What could,
how long that took.

29
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,780
It took about 12 years for this
process of clonal evolution to go on.

30
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:11,230
Then about seven years for the sub clones
to build up with metastatic capacity

31
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:16,400
and from metastasis to death was
on average about three years.

32
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,350
Normally the cancer is not
detected until this point.

33
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:22,663
Okay,

34
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,110
so we usually think of pancreatic
cancers killing quickly,

35
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:32,650
but in these cases it started at least
18 years before the patients died.

36
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,460
So there was clonal selection
and the diagnosis came too late.

37
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:42,590
There was some local adaptation of
the metastasis to the lung into liver.

38
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,633
Okay.

39
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,080
Another example of acute
lymphoblastic leukemia.

40
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:54,530
What you have here is the ancestor and
the names that are given in the boxes are

41
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,850
labeling the ways that we
recognize the sub clones.

42
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:06,570
So this is the probable ancestor and
these are the origins of the different sub

43
00:03:06,571 --> 00:03:11,530
clones.
They're from one cancer patient.

44
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,120
The numbers of copies in the different
clones is in front of the gene name.

45
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:23,830
So for example,
this is starting off with one copy here,

46
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:28,000
two of these, one of these and two
of these. And if you look down here,

47
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:32,260
you can see a clone which is
lacking any of those genes.

48
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:35,950
So they've been deleted and they've
also been deleted down here,

49
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,190
but it's picked up extra
copies of this gene.

50
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,470
So there are processes of
deletion and duplication,

51
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,210
which is are going on,
no single call replaced.

52
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,320
All of the others

53
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,380
there were had been repeated loss of
copy number variants and two genes packs

54
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:57,820
five and ETV six

55
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:04,620
and that generated a lot of genetic
heterogeneity, which hadn't in that case,

56
00:04:04,621 --> 00:04:05,890
been completely resolved.

57
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:12,070
Here's a case of renal cell carcinoma
and this one is analyzed in great detail

58
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:17,320
and it shows that there's
been evolutionary divergence
among clones that are

59
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:21,790
persisting in that evolutionary divergence
poses real problems for therapy.

60
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:27,810
So a primary tumor in this case on the
kidney sent metasticies into the long end

61
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,980
of the chest wall.

62
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:35,920
Both the primary tumor and the
metastasis consistent of sets of clones.

63
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,701
They weren't simple.

64
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:41,590
They were genetically heterogeneous
therapies that were designed to treat the

65
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:45,850
primary tumor would miss the
variation in the metastasis.

66
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:50,910
So that would be an effective therapies
designed to treat one metastasis would

67
00:04:51,371 --> 00:04:53,230
miss variation in the others.

68
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,860
Normally this is done by taking a biopsy
and the problem is that a biopsy would

69
00:04:59,351 --> 00:05:02,320
normally be coming from
just one metastasis.

70
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:08,640
So they were sequenced and what you can
see here are you tations that are in

71
00:05:11,031 --> 00:05:12,040
different samples.

72
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:17,041
So the samples are the roles
and the mutations are in jeans,

73
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:22,291
which are the columns and the ubiquitously
mutations are the ones which are

74
00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:26,500
found in many different samples.

75
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:31,360
Then there are some shared primary
mutations which are shared among a few

76
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:34,330
samples in the primary tumor.

77
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,890
Then there are some shared
mutations in metastasis. However,

78
00:05:38,891 --> 00:05:41,920
these are all of the
private mutations over here.

79
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,760
So these are found only
in individual samples.

80
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,293
Yeah,

81
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:52,790
so gray is the mutation is present.
Blue is that it's absent.

82
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:58,610
The purple gene names are that the
mutation was validated are these and the

83
00:05:58,611 --> 00:06:02,780
orange gene names. It's where validation
failed. There were a few of those.

84
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:09,020
The point of the picture is
that in the cancer like this,

85
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,160
this is a kidney cancer, this
metastasized into the chest and lungs.

86
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:19,920
There's such a huge amount of genetic
variation that a sample from one part of

87
00:06:20,441 --> 00:06:25,240
the primary tumor or from only one of
the metastasis is not going to give

88
00:06:25,241 --> 00:06:29,560
characteristics that could lead to the
cure of the whole thing. It's too diverse,

89
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:37,120
so this was another way to look at all
of that genetic heterogeneity in that

90
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:41,710
kidney cancer.
Here we see a phylogenetic tree.

91
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:47,820
The mutations that are ubiquitous are
in blue and the branch length here is

92
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:52,690
proportional to the number
of non synonymous mutations.

93
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,650
So it basically is a measure of
how much selection is going on.

94
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,510
The potential driver mutations
are indicated by arrows here.

95
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,440
The shared primary or mutations
are along this orange branch.

96
00:07:08,021 --> 00:07:12,640
The shared metastatic mutations are along
the screen branch and then the private

97
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:13,421
mutations,

98
00:07:13,421 --> 00:07:18,421
the ones that are unique to individual
clones are in red point here is that we

99
00:07:19,511 --> 00:07:22,720
need to treat the branches,
not the tweaks.

100
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:28,030
We need to be able to find
ways of targeting things
that are shared by all the

101
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,860
cells that are causing the problem.

102
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,393
Okay.

103
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:37,130
Another example comes from a Glioblastoma
and this was a molecular phylogenetic

104
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,440
investigation of a cancer
following chemotherapy.

105
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,490
The surviving population was
not a single resistant clone,

106
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:52,170
but there were multiple clones that
had different mutations for resistance.

107
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,780
Glioblastoma is a brain cancer,

108
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,323
okay?

109
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:59,260
Unless the treatments
eliminated all of the clones,

110
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:03,160
the survivors would persist
and probably flourish.

111
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,230
So again,

112
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,150
a single biopsy of one branch will not
be a sample that's sufficient to indicate

113
00:08:10,151 --> 00:08:12,280
the problems that are posed by a tree.

114
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:19,950
There's another kind of a
useful information we can
gain about cancers using

115
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,220
phylogenetic methods.

116
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,780
So this again is the system in which
Barrett's esophagus progresses to a soft

117
00:08:25,781 --> 00:08:27,280
geo with INA carcinomas.

118
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:32,500
And here we're using phylogenetic
inference to see how effective is therapy

119
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:36,550
using nonsteroidal inflammatory drugs,
anti inflammatory drugs.

120
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,920
In this case,

121
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:44,950
we have individuals that are indicated
by letters a through m and we can see

122
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:53,290
whether or not they were on or off the
NSA id and then look at the somatic

123
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,740
genomic abnormalities per genome per year.

124
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,610
So these are individuals who are
being followed, they're being sampled.

125
00:09:02,611 --> 00:09:06,960
At some point they start getting treatment
with nonsteroidal anti inflammatory

126
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:11,130
drugs. Samples are being taken
from their Barrett's esophagus.

127
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:16,580
And in those samples we are looking at
what is the frequency of any kind of

128
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:21,090
somatic genomic abnormality.
So both point mutations,

129
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,760
abnormal chromosome numbers and so forth.

130
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:30,590
As this makes clear the drug reduced
the rate of the acquisition of these

131
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:33,270
abnormalities tenfold.

132
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:38,550
So athlete inflammatory drugs or reducing
the rates of mutation that lead to

133
00:09:38,551 --> 00:09:41,760
cancer.
To summarize,

134
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:46,380
molecular phylogenetics can describe
the history of the evolution of a

135
00:09:46,381 --> 00:09:48,600
metastatic cancer in a single patient.

136
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:50,420
Yeah.

137
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:55,420
The evidence for cancer is a process of
clonal evolution is now overwhelming.

138
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:57,570
Yeah.

139
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:01,800
Cancers originate earlier.
They are older than we had expected.

140
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,220
Single biopsies of primary tumors.

141
00:10:05,221 --> 00:10:09,180
Seriously underestimate the clonal
heterogeneity of metastasis.

142
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:13,020
The are diff.
The heterogeneity is difficult to sample.

143
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:14,680
Yeah.

144
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,500
We have to, however,
treat the entire tree,

145
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,800
not the single branch that
sampled in a single biopsy.

146
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:27,740
Thus, phylogenetic inference is another
tool that we can use to evaluate the

147
00:10:27,741 --> 00:10:31,880
effectiveness of preventive and
therapeutic medicine for cancer.
