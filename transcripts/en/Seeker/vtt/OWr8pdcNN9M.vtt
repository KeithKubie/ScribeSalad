00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.030
It's called a BACULUM.

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.870
But we'll just call it a penis bone because
of reasons.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.639
Hey friends, Laci Green here.

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:15.030
If you're like me, you probably don't find
yourself thinking about

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.900
animal penises too often.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.040
But today, that changes.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.990
In humans, the penis is made up of spongey
cylinders that have lots of blood vessels.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.150
Those blood vessels fill up with blood and
boom, ready for copulation.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.830
This is actually a rarity amongst mammalians
though....MOST mammals have a penis bone instead.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.270
Various primates, rodents, bats, insects,
bears, cats, dogs....

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.910
they all have em!

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.160
The largest baculum in the animal kingdom
belongs to

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.160
the walrus, and

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.090
it reaches up to 30 inches long.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.100
Which....doesn't sound too cute if I'm being
honest.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.310
And the award for freakiest penis bone goes
to

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.850
the seed beetle, because it.....
looks like a torture device from hell.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.860
In mammals with a baculum, the bone stays
tucked away inside the body until it's sexytime.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.890
Then it's pushed out with the help of abdominal
muscles into a fleshy penis sheath that surrounds

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:03.890
the bone.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.130
It's pret-ty efficient if you think about
it.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.920
Just flex and you're all ready to go.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.920
Kinda makes you wish

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.010
you had a penis bone, right?

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.010
Pffff.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.010
So jelly.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.060
So why don't humans have one?

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.960
Blame it on NATURAL SELECTION yall.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.720
A few years ago, scientists in Switzerland
conducted an experiment with those freaky

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.720
seed beetles.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.720
See, the reason their
beetle penis credit Johanna RÃ¶nn

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.320
penis bone is so spiney is because it helps
to scrub away the sperm from the beetles competitors.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.680
So, the beetle with the spiniest peen can
make more babies.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.310
In the experiment, the beetles were isolated
from any sexual competition - just 1 female

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.310
and 1 male.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.840
They observed their monogamous mating and
offspring for 21 generations - all the while

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.490
keeping a close eye on those penises.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.170
What they found was that without any competition,

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.530
the spines got shorter.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.110
Without as much competition, they didn't need
it anymore!

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.659
In other species, the shape and size of the
baculum may help animals have more opportunities

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.420
to mate because they can be speedy about it
and they can have many mates in a short period

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.420
- like

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.820
the lion, who can copulate 250 times in 4
days.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.130
I know right?..........dang.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.799
Some scientists hypothesized that the baculum
may help the male deliver more sperm, and

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.770
others think that it could help get the sperm
closer to the egg.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.701
All of these functions translate into more
babies and a better chance of genetic survival.

00:02:12.701 --> 00:02:18.019
So in humans....we don't actually know for
sure why we lost our baculum, but there are

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.019
a few theories.

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.019
One is

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.019
monogamy.

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.700
Just like those beetles, monogamy makes the
mating game less competitive and so we may

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.590
have grown out of the need.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.640
Another similar theory is that we just don't
mate as much or as quickly.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.540
We like to....pull up a chair, have a glass
of wine, get to know each other first...i

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.040
mean, we're not ANIMALS...............oh wait.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.349
Alright peeps, there you got it.

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:39.349
Penis bones!

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:40.349
Important knowledge for your brain.

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.279
Thanks for joining me, we'll catcha again
soon with more DNews updates.
