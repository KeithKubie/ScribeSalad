00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
being was the manner in which you have
 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
being was the manner in which you have
experience<00:00:27.210><c> and</c><00:00:27.510><c> so</c><00:00:28.410><c> there</c><00:00:28.590><c> are</c><00:00:28.710><c> elements</c><00:00:29.070><c> of</c>

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 align:start position:0%
experience and so there are elements of
 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.630 align:start position:0%
experience and so there are elements of

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
being that aren't objective elements and
 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
being that aren't objective elements and
so<00:00:32.790><c> I</c><00:00:32.820><c> would</c><00:00:33.090><c> say</c><00:00:33.270><c> pain</c><00:00:33.660><c> is</c><00:00:33.690><c> a</c>

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 align:start position:0%
so I would say pain is a
 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.220 align:start position:0%
so I would say pain is a
