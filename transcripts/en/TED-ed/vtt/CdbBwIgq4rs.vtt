00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:10.982
On July 26, 1943,

00:00:10.982 --> 00:00:14.567
Los Angeles was blanketed by a thick
gas that stung people's eyes

00:00:14.567 --> 00:00:16.582
and blocked out the Sun.

00:00:16.582 --> 00:00:21.451
Panicked residents believed their city
had been attacked using chemical warfare.

00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:23.912
But the cloud wasn't an act of war.

00:00:23.912 --> 00:00:25.599
It was smog.

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:28.079
A portmanteau 
of smoke and fog,

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:31.957
the word "smog" was coined at the beginning
of the 20th century

00:00:31.957 --> 00:00:34.678
to describe the thick gray 
haze that covered cities

00:00:34.678 --> 00:00:35.684
such as London,

00:00:35.684 --> 00:00:36.393
Glasgow,

00:00:36.393 --> 00:00:38.768
and Edinburgh.

00:00:38.768 --> 00:00:40.888
This industrial smog was known to form

00:00:40.888 --> 00:00:44.359
when smoke from coal-burning 
home stoves and factories

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:47.118
combined with moisture in the air.

00:00:47.118 --> 00:00:50.288
But the smog behind 
the LA panic was different.

00:00:50.288 --> 00:00:53.540
It was yellowish with a chemical odor.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.319
Since the city didn't burn much coal,
its cause would remain a mystery

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:02.258
until a chemist named Arie Haagen-Smit
identified two culprits:

00:01:02.258 --> 00:01:05.758
volatile organic compounds, or VOCs,

00:01:05.758 --> 00:01:08.701
and nitrogen oxides.

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:11.510
VOCs are compounds that easily
become vapors

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.709
and may contain elements, such as carbon,

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:14.740
oxygen,

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.740
hydrogen,

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.651
chlorine,

00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:18.299
and sulfur.

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.989
Some are naturally produced 
by plants and animals,

00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:23.120
but others come from manmade sources,

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.130
like solvents,

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.181
paints,

00:01:25.181 --> 00:01:25.979
glues,

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.681
and petroleum.

00:01:27.681 --> 00:01:31.421
Meanwhile, the incomplete combustion
of gas in motor vehicles

00:01:31.421 --> 00:01:34.041
releases nitrogen oxide.

00:01:34.041 --> 00:01:38.040
That's what gives this type of smog
its yellowish color.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.722
VOCs and nitrogen oxide react with sunlight

00:01:41.722 --> 00:01:46.212
to produce secondary pollutants called
PANs and tropospheric,

00:01:46.212 --> 00:01:49.131
or ground-level, ozone.

00:01:49.131 --> 00:01:53.922
PANs and ozone cause eye irritation
and damage lung tissue.

00:01:53.922 --> 00:01:57.022
Both are key ingredients 
in photochemical smog,

00:01:57.022 --> 00:02:00.073
which is what had been plaguing LA.

00:02:00.073 --> 00:02:03.662
So why does smog affect some cities
but not others?

00:02:03.662 --> 00:02:08.332
Both industrial and photochemical smog
combine manmade pollution

00:02:08.332 --> 00:02:10.983
with local weather and geography.

00:02:10.983 --> 00:02:15.933
London's high humidity made it a prime
location for industrial smog.

00:02:15.933 --> 00:02:19.634
Photochemical smog is strongest in
urban areas with calm winds

00:02:19.634 --> 00:02:22.384
and dry, warm, sunny weather.

00:02:22.384 --> 00:02:25.933
The ultraviolet radiation from sunlight
provides the energy necessary

00:02:25.933 --> 00:02:30.084
to breakdown molecules that contribute
to smog formation.

00:02:30.084 --> 00:02:32.743
Cities surrounded by mountains, like LA,

00:02:32.743 --> 00:02:35.043
or lying in a basin, like Beijing,

00:02:35.043 --> 00:02:40.613
are also especially vulnerable to smog
since there's nowhere for it to dissipate.

00:02:40.613 --> 00:02:44.814
That's also partially due to a phenomenon
known as temperature inversion,

00:02:44.814 --> 00:02:47.894
where instead of warm air 
continuously rising upward,

00:02:47.894 --> 00:02:52.135
a pollution-filled layer of air remains 
trapped near the Earth's surface

00:02:52.135 --> 00:02:55.144
by a slightly warmer layer above.

00:02:55.144 --> 00:02:58.034
Smog isn't just an aesthetic eyesore.

00:02:58.034 --> 00:03:00.186
Both forms of smog irritate the eyes,

00:03:00.186 --> 00:03:00.955
nose,

00:03:00.955 --> 00:03:01.825
and throat,

00:03:01.825 --> 00:03:04.727
exacerbate conditions like asthma
and emphysema,

00:03:04.727 --> 00:03:09.296
and increase the risk 
of respiratory infections like bronchitis.

00:03:09.296 --> 00:03:12.845
Smog can be especially harmful 
to young children and older people

00:03:12.845 --> 00:03:16.064
and exposure in pregnant women has been
linked to low birth weight

00:03:16.064 --> 00:03:18.505
and potential birth defects.

00:03:18.505 --> 00:03:21.356
Secondary pollutants found 
in photochemical smog

00:03:21.356 --> 00:03:24.755
can damage and weaken crops
and decrease yield,

00:03:24.755 --> 00:03:27.825
making them more susceptible to insects.

00:03:27.825 --> 00:03:32.487
Yet for decades, smog was seen
as the inevitable price of civilization.

00:03:32.487 --> 00:03:36.627
Londoners had become accustomed to 
the notorious pea soup fog

00:03:36.627 --> 00:03:39.727
swirling over their streets until 1952,

00:03:39.727 --> 00:03:44.575
when the Great Smog of London shut down
all transportation in the city for days

00:03:44.575 --> 00:03:48.929
and caused more 
than 4,000 respiratory deaths.

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:52.387
As a result, the Clean Air Act of 1956

00:03:52.387 --> 00:03:55.586
banned burning coal in 
certain areas of the city,

00:03:55.586 --> 00:03:58.554
leading to a massive reduction in smog.

00:03:58.554 --> 00:04:02.847
Similarly, regulations on vehicle 
emissions and gas content in the US

00:04:02.847 --> 00:04:07.838
reduced the volatile compounds in the air
and smog levels along with them.

00:04:07.838 --> 00:04:11.538
Smog remains a major problem
around the world.

00:04:11.538 --> 00:04:14.968
Countries like China and Poland that
depend on coal for energy

00:04:14.968 --> 00:04:18.178
experience high levels of industrial smog.

00:04:18.178 --> 00:04:21.617
Photochemical smog and airborne particles
from vehicle emissions

00:04:21.617 --> 00:04:23.989
affect many rapidly developing cities,

00:04:23.989 --> 00:04:26.359
from Mexico City and Santiago

00:04:26.359 --> 00:04:29.339
to New Delhi and Tehran.

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:31.658
Governments have tried many methods
to tackle it,

00:04:31.658 --> 00:04:36.784
such as banning cars from driving
for days at a time.

00:04:36.784 --> 00:04:40.159
As more than half of the world's 
population crowds into cities,

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:44.110
considering a shift to mass transit
and away from fossil fuels

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.990
may allow us to breathe easier.
