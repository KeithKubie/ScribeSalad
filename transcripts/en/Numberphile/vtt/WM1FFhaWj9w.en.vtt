00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.840
PAUL SMITH: And then when they
get to 70, that's where the

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.070
big problems start, because the
French haven't invented a

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.950
word for 70.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.250
BRADY HARAN: I always assume the
one thing that is kind of

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.890
international is numbers,
mathematics.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.400
That's the one thing that
is the same everywhere.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.520
You're about to ruin
this, aren't you?

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.770
PAUL SMITH: Yes, I am.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.440
One thing that you learn when
you're studying a foreign

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.490
language is that counting
systems are very different.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.660
And, in fact, it's one of the
ways that you can tell if

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.750
somebody's a really good speaker
of a foreign language.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.890
You can really tell what their
real mother tongue is when

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.546
they start counting, because
even if somebody operates, you

00:00:38.546 --> 00:00:40.810
know, an English person living
in France, when they start

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.910
counting to themselves, they'll
probably count to

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.140
themselves in English.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.190
They're our closest neighbors,
so you'd have thought that

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.140
maybe they'd count in
the same way as us.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.280
But one of the things that I
have to keep repeating to my

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.860
students is that, in fact,
the French don't

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:53.950
count in the same way.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.180
And they use numbers in very
different ways in a whole

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.390
range of different everyday
environments.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.150
Let me give you some examples.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.510
So the French-- well, what do
we do in England when we're

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.239
counting numbers?

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.220
We give numbers, the first 12
numbers when we're counting,

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.300
we give them individual names.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.700
So we go 1 to 12.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.540
And then we slip into a thing
where we go 13, 14, which is

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.280
kind of 3 and 10, 4 and
10, and so forth.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.940
The French start off in a
slightly different way.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.150
They go a bit further.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.920
Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq,
six, sept, huit, neuf, dix,

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.440
onze, douze, treize, quatorze,
quinze, seize.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.650
And then they go for our 17,
dix-sept, 10-7; dix-huit,

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.920
10-8; dix-neuf, 10-9; and
then vingt for 20.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.400
It's very similar, the
counting system

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.770
after that, to English.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.440
So they go on to 20, as
I said was vingt.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.920
Then they go to 30, trente.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.740
Quarante for 40.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.270
Cinquante for 50.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.060
Soixante for 60.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.160
And then when they get to 70,
that's where the big problems

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.020
start, because the
French haven't

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.160
invented a word for 70.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.090
Instead what they do is they
count to 60 and add 10.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.480
So whereas we go to 60 and then
go to 70, a French person

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.770
goes to 60, but then goes to 60
plus 10, because they say

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.350
soixante-dix.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.080
Soixante-dix is 70 in French.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.130
Soixante-dix literally means
60-10, but it means 70.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.780
Oh, they know what
the number 70 is.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.510
They don't sort of do
this plus business.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.830
And a French person, when they
hear you say soixante-dix,

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.130
they don't think, oh,
that's 60 and 10.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.290
They see 70.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.560
So the mental picture that is
conjured by the sound of

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.150
soixante-dix is still 70,
the same as we would.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.430
And then they continue by
instead of say-- they haven't

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.400
invented a word, for
example, for 71.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.290
So that's soixante et onze,
literally 60 and 11.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.180
It's rather odd with these
ones that they

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.020
say soixante et onze--

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.850
"et" is the word for "and"--

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.500
because when they get to 72,
they just say soixante-douze.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.230
Soixante-douze, 60-12.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.840
And it's only when we're dealing
with ones that they

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.110
use the "et."

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.160
But it gets even more confusing
from the English

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.290
point of view, because you
think, OK, so we've got

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.980
60-10, that's 70.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.620
Soixante et onze,
soixante-douze,

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.100
soixante-treize,
soixante-quatorze,

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.880
soixante-quinze,
soixante-seize,

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.260
soixante-dix-sept,
soixante-dix-huit,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.420
soixante-dix-neuf.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.730
What do they do when
they get to 80?

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.120
Surely they've got
a word for 80.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.010
Well, no.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.260
Because the French, when they
get to that number, they say

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.060
quatre-vingts, which
means 4 20s.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.780
Well, that's what it means,
4 20s, literally.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.280
The French, of course, when they
hear quatre-vingts, see

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.790
80 in their minds.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.020
And then they go
quatre-vingt-un, 4 20s, 1.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.655
4 20s, 2.

00:03:38.655 --> 00:03:40.420
BRADY HARAN: Not 4 20s and 1?

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.890
PAUL SMITH: No.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:41.650
They'd just be-- ah.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.670
The reason they don't say 4 20s
and 1 is because it's too

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.200
many words.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.200
So there's also a style issue
here, because, you know, the

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.230
French love their style.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.260
But what they do do then, and
this is the other weird thing,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.610
when they get to 90, they still
haven't even thought of

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.650
another word for 90 or
a decent word for 90.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:00.630
So what do they say?

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.920
They say quatre-vingt-dix,
4 20s, 10.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.780
And then when they get
to 91, they say

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.640
quatre-vingt-onze, 4 20s, 11.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.720
92 is quatre-vingt-douze.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.580
93 is quatre-vingt-treize.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.380
94 is quatre-vingt-quatorze.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.420
95, quatre-vingt-quinze.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.810
And so it goes, until
they get up to 100.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.800
And they have invented
a word for 100.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.770
So 100 is cent.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.070
One of the big problems, of
course, with this kind of

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.220
numbering system is when you're
listening to somebody

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.570
giving you a phone number,
because if

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.080
I could just explain--

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.880
let me think of an English
phone number.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.280
So you might have 0115, so
that's your Nottingham code.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.280
Then you'd have 962 would be the
subcode for the exchange.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.930
And then the individual
number would be 5782.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.740
And in English, we would read
out all of the numbers,

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.090
0-1-1-5, or we might say
0-double 1-5, 962, 5782.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.045
BRADY HARAN: This isn't a real
number, by the way, is it?

00:05:01.045 --> 00:05:01.340
PAUL SMITH: No, no.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.780
I just made that one up.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:04.330
OK.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.590
So that's an example of an
English telephone number.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.790
But in France, they do it
completely differently.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.860
They will take the numbers and
they will say they will

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:22.110
actually distinguish the
numbers 62, 58, 49, 27.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.800
And when you ask somebody for
their phone number, they will

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.850
tell you that it is
62, 58, 49, 27.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:29.430
They won't say--

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.540
BRADY HARAN: They'll do that
for all numbers, will they?

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.150
PAUL SMITH: They'll do that
for all telephone numbers.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.555
They won't say 625-849-27.

00:05:36.555 --> 00:05:40.070
And this causes not big
problems, but if you're on the

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.570
telephone to a client in France
who wants your mobile

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.920
number and you're used to giving
your mobile number in

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.550
the way the English do and then
you try to do it to the

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.840
French, they find that very
difficult to cope with.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.320
And it works in the
other direction.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.420
My students are endlessly
telling me about the problems

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.630
they had copying down
telephone numbers.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.790
And of course, the really big
problems start when you get to

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.990
numbers that start with
a 6, with a 7, with an

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.640
8, and with a 9.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.230
So it's a problem, because
if you're English

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:09.900
and you hear soixante--

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.100
let's remember that numbers,
what we would call 60 to 69,

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.590
start with the word soixante.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.340
But so do numbers 70 to 79.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.755
Let's say that your friend
starts saying "my number is"--

00:06:21.755 --> 00:06:23.820
I'll say it in French,
"mon numero, c'est

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.790
soixante" you start--

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:26.650
you do that.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.730
And then they say "et onze" and
you have to go back and

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:34.260
correct it, because it's not
soixante at all, it's 71.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.500
But the other thing that the
French do with numbers while

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.850
we're on the subject, that's the
French for "10 point 69."

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.920
Let's say that that's the world
record for the women's

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.480
100 meters dash in
the Olympics.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.720
Now you can see that's very
different from the way that we

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.780
would write it in English.

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.090
It's also very different from
the way that we would say it.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.280
There we've got a
decimal point.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.860
And the French are
using a comma.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.660
But they also say
it differently.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:03.060
In English we say "10 point 69,"
because we separate the

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.080
tenths and the hundredths.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:12.720
But the French would
say "10 comma 69."

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.230
So you have to listen
now very carefully.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.200
If you're watching a French
sports commentary, for

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.090
example, if you're watching the
Olympic Games in France

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.190
and you're trying to catch the
time, you have to listen out

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:27.680
for not 10 point 69, but "dix
virgule soixante-neuf," "10

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.850
comma 69." So once again,
you've got this issue of

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:35.020
numbers being grouped
together.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.340
And that's something the
French do all the time.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.930
They don't separate individual
numbers out.

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:43.760
They group them and
use their name.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.600
The word the French use for a
comma is "virgule." And they

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.390
use that in grammar as they
use it in numbers as well.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:54.930
So when a French person reads
out this time, then they will

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:58.340
say "dix virgule"--

00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:59.190
comma--

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:00.550
"soixante-neuf."

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:03.406
BRADY HARAN: To a French person,
is that "10 point 695"

00:08:03.406 --> 00:08:05.860
or is that 10,695?

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.580
PAUL SMITH: It's 10,
virgule, 695.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:14.060
So it would be "dix virgule six
cent quatre-vingt-quinze."

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.450
That would be the way
they express it.

00:08:18.803 --> 00:08:22.740
BRADY HARAN: How would a French
person write 10,695?

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.800
PAUL SMITH: Well, they would
either just do that--

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.700
and very often they
leave a space.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.550
In a French textbook you might
find there's a space between

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:33.840
the thousands and the 695.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.919
Or occasionally, this is going
to confuse you, just

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:39.130
occasionally they'll do that.

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:42.659
10,000, full stop, 6-9-5.

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:45.650
So in fact, you could say that
the French and the English do

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.490
exactly the opposite thing.

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:50.520
And you could argue that it's
just to confuse each other and

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.390
it's deliberate.

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:53.460
Well, I don't have a problem
with it, but it has caused

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.570
problems in the past.

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:58.880
There was a rather unfortunate
case in a French hospital a

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.990
few years ago where there
was a serious--

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.750
too large a dose of something
was administered to patients

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:13.020
simply because of a misreading
of a decimal point for this,

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.480
or a comma not being read
the right way round.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.130
So it can be a big problem
in technical translation.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:22.060
Technical translators need to
be absolutely sure that they

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.310
get it right, because
otherwise it can

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:26.670
go very, very wrong.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:28.460
BRADY HARAN: If you'd like to
hear a bit more about French

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:31.750
numbers, including why it's
impossible to score 20 out of

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:35.020
20 in France, check out another
video we've got here

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.150
on "Numberphile." Or if you'd
just like to hear more about

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:40.310
languages in general from people
like Paul and others,

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:42.620
check out another channel I've
got called "Words of the

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.400
World." It's got all sorts of
fascinating videos about

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:50.150
things like California
or biscuit or vodka.

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:52.130
There's loads of videos on there
already and there's new

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:54.530
ones going on every week,
so maybe subscribe.
