00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.500
Why am I dancing to Bollywood songs in a semi in the middle of nowhere?

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.340
Because I'm on the road with a Punjabi trucker
who's living the American Dream.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.480
Even music videos from Punjab, India, hype how cool it is to come to America and become a trucker.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.900
And the Indian immigrants who get into trucking here

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.720
have a crazy backstory you’ve probably never heard of. Hint: It involves crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.300
Today I’m riding along with Satnam Singh. He’s been trucking for 25 years.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.880
Satnam’s one of thousands of Sikh immigrants from the
Indian state of Punjab who've taken up

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.400
trucking here in America. In California in particular, Punjabis are so much part

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.200
of the industry that they run trucking schools, own trucks stops

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.019
– even publish a bilingual trucking magazine. It's also an
industry that stretches all the way back

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.080
to India, where Punjabis run trucking
companies, too. So it's a natural fit for new immigrants.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.560
— Oh wow. Cool!

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.080
— In a Batman lunch bag!

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.700
— Yummy.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.700
When Satnam doesn’t have his  wife's home-cooked food to bring on the road, he stops at one of the many

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.820
Punjabi dhabas, or truck stops, that have popped up along highways around the country.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.660
Satnam and lots of other drivers cover their hair as part of the Sikh faith.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.440
The turban stands for compassion and service. It's like a daily reminder to be a good neighbor.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.860
But it’s often misunderstood.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.320
Do you ever worry for your safety?

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.540
Are you ever scared?

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.360
Attacks against Sikhs have been making national news, especially after 9/11.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.380
(sirens) “(Newscaster) … carried out the deadly shooting rampage inside a Sikh temple that left

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.760
six people dead and three others critically wounded.” (sirens)

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.060
“… aggressively walked over to my dad’s car and started punching my dad in the face.”

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.980
“(Newscaster) Outrage and fear mounting in one Manteca neighborhood after an

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.060
elderly Sikh man is attacked in broad daylight.”

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.220
But there have been moments of solidarity, too. In 2017, Punjabi truckers

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.720
joined truckers across the nation to
protest regulation changes in the industry.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.240
Right now, there’s actually a shortage of truckers in the U.S. because

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.920
the demand is high but the job is tough. Truckers often spend days, even weeks,

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.610
away from their families, living on the road. Immigrants like Satnam are

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.250
are increasingly filling the need. And in California,

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.600
nearly half of truck drivers are immigrants – many of them Sikhs from India.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.960
There are about half a million Sikhs in the U.S. They gather at events like this one

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.560
to cook and serve the community free food, or langar. It’s an example of the

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.260
“seva” or selfless service, that’s a hallmark of the Sikh faith. Sikhs also believe in one

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.340
God and show respect to their holy book. For many who left Punjab for the U.S., the journey wasn’t easy.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.860
I know a guy who crossed from Mexico

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.400
border. He stayed in, they call it a camp, he stayed in a camp for a year and

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.220
a half. And he had to pay a bail bond for, I think it was $20,000.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.120
Just to get out. And he’s still on a case of asylum.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.300
This story isn’t unique. For decades, Indians have been making long journeys to reach the U.S.-Mexico border.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.320
In some detention facilities, as many as 40 percent of the people being held are from India.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.520
Gurdwaras like this one, are where Sikhs come to pray. But it’s been reported that Sikhs in detention have

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.820
faced religious discrimination, like not having access to vegetarian meals.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.440
There have been a number of lawsuits about it, too.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.140
And lately, more and more have been crossing that border claiming their community is under attack from

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.360
India's government, and that activists have been arrested and even tortured.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.270
Sikhs are a minority in India, where the majority of the population is Hindu.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.330
Back in the 80s, armed Sikh groups fighting for

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.470
independence from India started carrying out assassinations, drawing the attention

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.780
of the Indian government. In 1984, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi sent troops to

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.770
clear the separatists from the Golden Temple, the holiest shrine in Sikhism,

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.020
where they had been meeting and storing guns. Hundreds — by some estimates, even

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.470
thousands of people died in the attack — including many civilians. Months later,

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.670
the prime minister was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards, which set off a wave

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.810
of violence against Sikh communities across India. Homes and temples were

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.320
burned, women were gang raped, and more than 3,000 civilians were killed.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.240
And how many countries did you travel through before you came to America?

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.880
When Satnam got to Mexico, he had to cross the Rio Grande to get to the United States.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.220
After Satnam crossed, he was pulled over by immigration authorities and taken to

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:53.159
a detention facility where he was held for a few months. But Satnam was one

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:58.460
of the lucky ones. He was released from detention, got his green card, and after a few years, got into trucking.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.659
He’s now a U.S. citizen with his own family and a

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:04.680
good life in Yuba City, California – which, by the way, is known as “Little Punjab.”

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.879
Punjabis have been there for over a century. The first Punjabi immigrants

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:11.430
came as laborers back in the early 1900s,

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:15.389
building railroads and working on farms along the West Coast. Many left families

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:19.199
behind in India and married Mexican women who also worked the farms, creating

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:23.219
a whole new generation of Punjabi-Mexican families. Even Satnam once

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.800
worked on a farm but found trucking to be a much better fit.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.220
So uncle, how much money can truckers earn?

00:07:54.620 --> 00:08:00.720
I couldn’t believe truckers could earn so much! Satnam does have to pay a lot in expenses like fuel, repairs and

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:06.140
taxes, but still. After more than 12 hours on the road, I was exhausted. So Satnam

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:11.720
treated me to his usual pick-me-up: chai. He boils the water with jaggery, or sugar cane ...

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.060
… adds the tea and milk … and gets the temperature just right.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.060
— Yay!

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:21.260
Being on the road all day reminded me just how important immigrants are to

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:24.270
this country. Without truckers like Satnam, we wouldn’t have fresh

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:29.249
produce, our online deliveries, or stocked shelves at stores around the country. But

00:08:29.249 --> 00:08:33.160
thanks in part to a small community of Sikh Americans, we do.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:33.660
Yummy.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:34.740
It’s great.

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:39.360
