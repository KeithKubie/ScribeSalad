Why Vampires Can't Exist... and 9 Other Amazing
Facts

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.800
1.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.350
How do we know vampires don’t exist?

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.750
If each vampire ate just 1 meal a day, starting
with just 1 vampire and each victim then turning

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.700
into a vampire, it would take about 1 month
for the entire human population to become

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.700
vampires.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.700
(QF 466)

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.700
2.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.070
Pearls will dissolve if placed in vinegar
as they are mostly made up of calcium carbonate,

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.699
easily dissolved by acetic acid, which is
most of what vinegar is.

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:26.699
(QF 510)

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:27.699
3.

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:34.021
The 7 Wonders of the Ancient World were: the
Great Pyramid of Giza (2584-2561 BC), the

00:00:34.021 --> 00:00:40.400
Hanging Gardens of Babylon (600 BC), the Temple
of Artemis at Ephesus (550 BC), the Statue

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:47.750
of Zeus at Olympia (435 BC), Mausoleum at
Halicarnassus (351 BC), the Colossus of Rhodes

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.630
(292-280 BC), and the Lighthouse of Alexandria
(280 BC).

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.560
It should be noted though that many historians
doubt that the Hanging Gardens ever actually

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.560
existed.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.560
(QF 519)

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.560
4.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.280
If you live in the U.S., you are nearly four
times as likely to be killed by a vending

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.050
machine as a shark, with an average annual
death rate of 2.18 for vending machines and

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.380
0.6 deaths from shark attacks.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.380
(QF 540)

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.380
5.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.760
You are about 40% more likely to survive a
commercial plane crash if you sit in the back

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.040
row of the plane compared to the front row,
according to a study done by Popular Mechanics

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.390
covering every accident aboard commercial
planes from 1971 to 2007.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.530
(QF 542)

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.530
6.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.850
“Nazi” isn’t just the name of a one-time
prominent political party, but also the Swahili

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.200
word for “coconut”.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.200
(QF 551)

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.200
7.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.770
Ever wonder what the Q in Q-tips stands for?

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.500
Wonder no more- it stands for “Quality”.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.600
Before they were given that name, they were
called “Baby Gays”, invented and named

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.030
in the 1920s by Leo Gerstenzang.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.030
(QF 566)

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.030
8.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.960
The wife of famed poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
tragically died when she accidentally dropped

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.390
a burning match onto her hoop skirt, which
burst into flames and ultimately killing her.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.390
(QF 578)

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.390
9.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.150
Despite being twice as abundant as iron in
the earth’s crust, in much of the 19th century,

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.770
aluminum cost more than gold due to the difficulty
in isolating it from other substances.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.290
For reference, in the 1850s, one ingot of
aluminum went for $550 (about $15,000 today).

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.280
By 1900, thanks to technological advancements,
the same ingot was selling for just 25 cents

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.280
($7 today).

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.280
(QF 584)

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.280
10.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.010
In the time it takes you to listen to this,
hundreds of billions of neutrinos have passed

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.010
through your body.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.850
Specifically, close to 65 billion neutrinos
from the Sun pass through every square centimeter

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:38.830
of you that is currently perpendicular to
the Sun every single second that passes.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:46.370
(QF 587)
