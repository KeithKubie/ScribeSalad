I don't know I guess it's still there I

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630
I don't know I guess it's still there I
 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.729
I don't know I guess it's still there I
don't know and I'm glad that all this

00:01:58.729 --> 00:01:58.739
don't know and I'm glad that all this
 

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:00.800
don't know and I'm glad that all this
stuff is available but there's there's

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810
stuff is available but there's there's
 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.920
stuff is available but there's there's
something

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930
 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.740
I think you can't just go one way you

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750
I think you can't just go one way you
 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.940
I think you can't just go one way you
have to try to get as much as you can

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950
have to try to get as much as you can
 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.340
have to try to get as much as you can
get from as many different directions

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350
get from as many different directions
 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.980
get from as many different directions
like if you just go into a school I

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990
like if you just go into a school I
 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.800
like if you just go into a school I
think the danger is just to go into a

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810
think the danger is just to go into a
 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:28.600
think the danger is just to go into a
school and stay within that I mean

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610
school and stay within that I mean
 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.250
school and stay within that I mean
there's a lot in there if there's you

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260
there's a lot in there if there's you
 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.290
there's a lot in there if there's you
can spend your life just right in there

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300
can spend your life just right in there
 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.720
can spend your life just right in there
but there's a lot of other stuff outside

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730
but there's a lot of other stuff outside
 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.790
but there's a lot of other stuff outside
of there and I think dangerous is just

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800
of there and I think dangerous is just
 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:43.150
of there and I think dangerous is just
staying closing off whatever else what

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160
staying closing off whatever else what
 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.040
staying closing off whatever else what
other other ways there are to learn

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050
other other ways there are to learn
 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.530
other other ways there are to learn
about stuff like the thing about go to a

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540
about stuff like the thing about go to a
 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.220
about stuff like the thing about go to a
college and then end up teaching at the

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230
college and then end up teaching at the
 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.020
college and then end up teaching at the
college and then UT you know this sort

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030
college and then UT you know this sort
 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.479
college and then UT you know this sort
of incestuous I think starts happening

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489
of incestuous I think starts happening
 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.390
of incestuous I think starts happening
and I'm not sure how healthy that is I

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400
and I'm not sure how healthy that is I
 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.020
and I'm not sure how healthy that is I
think there's laws against

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030
