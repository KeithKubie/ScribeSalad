00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.860
Insertions, deletions, and SNVs can really screw up

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.770
a coding region. But where do they come from?

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.620
&gt;&gt; Well, mutations can come from lots of different places.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.230
But these types, in particular, predominantly come from replication errors.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.640
&gt;&gt; So, do you mean, like, the DNA is actually replicated?

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.720
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Inside a cell, there's molecular machinery responsible. Doing all

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.170
the work for replicating the DNA. And sometimes it makes a mistake.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.130
&gt;&gt; Does it fix its mistakes?

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.800
&gt;&gt; it does.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.660
your body does a good job at fixing

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.270
mistakes. But even after fixing all those mistakes, it

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.640
still misses some and you have a mutation

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.770
rate of about one in every 300 million letters.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.820
&gt;&gt; I like those odds, that doesn't sound that bad.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.680
&gt;&gt; It's true, it doesn't sound too bad until you consider

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.530
that there are there three billion letters in the human genome. And

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.050
you've got six billion, counting both copies in every cell. So that

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.840
turns out at about 60 new mutations every time a cell divides.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.570
&gt;&gt; Wow. That really does build up.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.950
&gt;&gt; It does build up over time but, those

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.030
mutations are great new source of variation for new alleles.
