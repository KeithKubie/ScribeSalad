00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.080
One of the things that's the most peculiar about life in the developed economies in our own time

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:16.620
is the way we look at work and in particular, the way we think that work should be about two things:

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.880
Making money of course. But also in far more strangely:

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.860
Finding fulfillment, creativity and meaning.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.220
It's a beautiful idea, of course. But it's also a highly unusual one

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.740
which causes us quite a few headaches as well.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.660
It's worth taking a look into the history of work...

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.320
The garden of Eden 3,900BC

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.200
According to Christian doctrine

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.380
when Adam and Eve are expelled from the Garden of Eden for eating an apple

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.680
that punishment for defying God's wishes is work.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.200
"By the sweat of your brow, you'll lead your food until you return to the ground".

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.700
the Lord informs them.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.140
Work is what distinguishes life inparadise from the world we know.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.040
Adam will have to work

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.680
until his 930 years old.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:02.780
Athens 335 PC

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.580
Aristotle opens his public school: the Lyceum

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.420
a centre of learning for wealthy and cultured young Athenians.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.820
Aistotle make a bold claim:

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.580
The life of the mind is only open to rich people.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.720
"Anyone who has actually to earn money to live is a slave." Aristotle tells us.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.340
However, outwardly grand their life might be,

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.420
the pursuit of money and good intellectual work is simply impossible, the philosopher declares.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.920
and he's widely believed for hundred of years.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.440
Hippo, Roman Africa, 396 AD

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.800
Saint Augustine becomes the Bishop of Hippo

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.000
and in his sermons resurrects the Christian notion of work

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.960
as a result of original sin.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.180
In his sermon of the New Testament,

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.340
Augustine tells his audience:

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.640
Many of whom slaves, the work is always going to be miserable.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.820
From this cup of sorrow, no one may be excused.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.100
The cup that Adam has pledged must be drunk.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.520
The only relief is to look forward to the next life in God's kingdom.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.340
Rome 1508,

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.380
The Florentine painter, sculptor, architect and poet Michelangelo

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.740
begins painting the ceiling of the Sixtine Chapel

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.520
commissioned by Pope Julius the 2nd.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.180
He's given complete freedom to design the work and promised a lot of money in return.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.580
Michelangelo, along with his fellow Italian genius, Leonardo da Vinci

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.700
embody a new approach to work:

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.840
They work for money; hiring out their talents to the highest bidders in the courts of Europe

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.060
but they're evidently not slave.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.780
At the same time they do not work just for the money,

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.320
They do it for the inherent fulfillment that the work brings.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.640
Our modern ideas of work are a lot the Renaissance idea of remunerative creative genius.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.940
Our own ambitions are now democratized versions

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.420
of the aspiration of men like Leonardo and Michelangelo.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.560
We too, wish to be paid and creative.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.700
Württemberg, Holy Roman Empire 1520

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.120
Martin Luther, the founder of Protestantism, makes mementos point

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.100
That one could serve God through work of many different kinds

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.240
and not just as it previously been argued by Catholicism

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.060
simply by entering the the priesthood.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:15.440
He proposes that, the common work of a servant or handmaiden, can be more acceptable to God

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.200
than all the fastings and works of a monk or a priest.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.420
God is milking the cows through the vocation of the milkmaid.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.020
For Luther, God has endowed each one of us with talents

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.080
that can be used to help another out, which is how work becomes moral.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.080
Everyone undertaking essential tasks, he mentions cleaning, milking, downing, teaching

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.680
is wearing what Luther calls the mask of God, since God is behind each task.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:48.100
This, Luther says, demonstrates God's love. He ensures that we're endowed with the qualities to look after one another through our work.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.820
Work for Luther, is therefore the best means to employ the doctrine of "Love thy neighbor".

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:00.940
Protestantism is responsible for a momentous reevaluation of the worth and dignity of ordinary labor.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.240
Paris, France 1750,

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.740
Diderot and d'Alembert published the first volume of the Encyclopédie

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.900
which sets out to cover each and every branch of human work

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.840
There is one chapter in which Diderot writes with particular admiration about bakers

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.400
There are others on the work of farmers, bellmakers, locksmiths, and cloth weavers.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.620
It's the longest illustrated poem in praise of ordinary work ever written and it has a huge impact

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.600
on how people perceive the prestige of work.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.220
Paris, France, 1844

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.180
the exiled Karl Marx finishes his "Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844"

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.420
A series of notes on capitalism containing some of his most interesting thinking about work.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.480
He attacks capitalism not because workers don't get paid enough or are exploited

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.400
but for a far more interesting reason: because too often, their work is boring.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.800
And it doesn't allow them to develop their characters.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.320
That's the true problem with capitalism in Marx's eyes.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.420
Marx, who worked 12 hours a day most days is no enemy of work.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:08.420
What  infuriates him about capitalism, is that it seems to prevent us from enjoying our work, enjoying it as much as he enjoyed his.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:14.260
because it encourages the production of goods, disconnected from the talents and aspirations of the worker.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.540
that's what he so desperately wishes to correct.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:22.840
Communism isn't a project for getting rid of work, it's about making work more enjoyable.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.800
University of Chicago, USA, 1899

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.520
An irritable American academic publishes his first book: The Theory of the leisure class.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:38.740
In it Thorstein Veblen captures very clearly an idea of being upper-class that's about to die out forever

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:45.220
Veblen argues that as soon as people make it in society, they try to show that superiority by displaying signs

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.420
of what leisurely and idle people they are.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:57.200
Veblen writes that: "The characteristic feature of the rich is a conspicuous exemption from useful employment"

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.840
Veblen well may be right for his own day...

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.080
but everything is about to change.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:07.500
Within a few decades, everyone falls prey to a new cult: the cult of working hard and being very very busy all the time

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.260
Soon, only the unemployed are idle. Everyone else is working away furiously.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:17.260
The richer you are, the more you keep working to show that you're good and serious.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.600
Be idle is the new taboo.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.400
Washington DC, USA, 1945,

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:31.020
With work newly prestigious, one of the major challenges of societies becomes that of correctly mining the talents of everyone.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:37.340
and helping them to find their way into the right jobs, that is jobs that will fulfill them and make them money.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:43.620
Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter, Isabel Briggs Myers run the first Briggs-Myers Indicated test

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.080
On George Washington medical school students.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.720
This test developed throughout the second World war, indicates personality types, and tries to pair people out

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:58.100
with ideal jobs. The test uses 93 questions to figure out which one of 4 main personality types you might be.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:03.120
Introverts/Extroverts; Thinkers/Feelers; Sensers/Intuitives; Judgers/Perceivers.

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:10.820
So for example, an introvert will enjoy thinking and working alone in small peaceful groups, and will be suited to work as an accountant, a dentist or librarian.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:18.160
but an extrovert will enjoy action-dominated, high-octane work and  might go for acting, salesmanship or trading in financial institutions.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:25.040
The gole Briggs and Myers says: is to find the type of work that suits you best, work is about making the correct lifestyle choice

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:30.380
that suits your personnality. It's not about arbitrary aims, such as money.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.860
Living rooms, USA, January 22 1984,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:42.300
Apple Computers launches the only national airing of its famous 1984 advert during the halftime commercials of the Super Bowl.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:48.000
The 60-second advert sees a heroine, dressed in bright running gear, saving army of soulless workers

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.640
from the conformity of standardized work, by destroying their Big Brother-like leader.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.160
It's an idea as old as the Renaissance: there's good work and bad work

00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:03.400
And the good work is the creative kind, except now, unlike in Michelangelo's day, thanks to technology, this is for everyone.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:09.080
The advert carried the famous tagline: You'll see why 1984 won't be like "1984".

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:15.680
The advert underlined the liberating colorful and energetic Mac as a deliverance from the technophobic drudgery of industrial labor.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:21.600
The future of work is going to be fun, original and expressive in Apple's hands.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.640
But, for millions of the unemployed or the unhappily employed,

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:32.180
the dream has not turned out to be so easy. It can be doubly painful, when you meant to having such fun at work

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:35.200
to find no work at all, or work that doesn't fulfill your soul.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:40.340
The modern world has made the career crisis one of the central difficulties of existence.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:47.380
We're asking so much of our working lives. So no wonder they sometimes don't deliver against the expectations that we now have of them.

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:50.360
Too often our jobs are closer to the toil of Adam

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:59.000
than the life-enhancing creativity of Michelangelo. That remains the challenge for the future of work.
