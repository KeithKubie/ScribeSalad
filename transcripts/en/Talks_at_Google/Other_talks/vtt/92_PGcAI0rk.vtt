00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.630
FEMALE SPEAKER: Welcome and
thank you so much for being

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.119
with us here at Google.

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:08.970
JOHN PHILIPPIDIS: Thanks
for having us.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:09.500
FEMALE SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.005
Now, Brett you have a couple of
frag films to actually show

00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:14.360
us before we started
the interview.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.260
And I believe we're starting
with frag 10.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.500
Tell us a little bit
about this frag.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.340
BRETT LEONARD: Well, what a
frag film is, we have this

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.540
idea called PopFictionLife,
which is a way of making

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.380
musical movies that can be

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.390
distributed through the internet.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.250
But there's still cinema.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.310
They're not webisodes.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.200
They're not episodic
in that sense.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.910
It's still independent cinema.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.790
So it's really a feature film.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.600
But when you're doing
independent cinema these days,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.780
and you don't have Tom Cruise or
giant movie stars in them--

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.680
not to say that you guys aren't
giant movie stars.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.310
You're music stars.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.210
But you have to seduce the
audience to get them to get

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.650
into the thing.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.330
So we create what I call
frags, or fragments.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.840
And we give away half the
movie with fragments--

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.319
with these frags.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:06.570
You don't get all the story.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.940
You don't get all the music.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.860
So if you like it, and you want
to see the whole film,

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.650
actually this Sunday, December
9, we've been releasing the

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.440
frags over the past
several months.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.610
We're going to be releasing
the entire film for $5

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.340
following the example of Louis
CK, who did, I think, an

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.590
amazing thing of getting direct
to the consumer with a

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.320
price point that makes sense
for independent content.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.480
And if you just want to
watch half of it for

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.560
free, that's fine.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.610
Because it's really about not
forcing it down people's

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.100
throats, not doing the
vertically integrated

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.390
corporate marketing that
works with mega-movies.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.400
And what this allows, is it
allows you to do something

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.510
that is a little more
creatively free.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.770
Every film in Hollywood now
has to have someone with a

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.780
cape or a cowl or something
like that.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.320
FEMALE SPEAKER: Nothing
wrong with that.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.260
BRETT LEONARD: And there's
nothing wrong with that.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.890
I go see those with my son, and
I absolutely love them.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.540
But that's about--

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.517
THEODORE PAGANO: We tried
to get capes but he

00:02:04.517 --> 00:02:05.340
wouldn't have it.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.550
FEMALE SPEAKER: I can have
a cape so we're good.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.139
BRETT LEONARD: So I
always wanted to--

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:10.900
in the past, I've done science
fiction thriller films--

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.820
but I love music, and I
wanted to make a rock

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.180
and roll road picture.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.800
And so when it came to that, I
was looking around for a band

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.650
and I heard they're called
Burlap to Cashmere and there's

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:28.950
a song on it called
The Other County.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.880
And I just instantly saw this
movie in my head when I was

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.500
listening to it.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.840
Then I met the guys and being
characters as they are and

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.390
tremendous live musicians, I
thought we had a chance to do

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.550
something where we could
actually record all the music

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.710
when we were doing
the film live.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.380
So there's no overdubbing.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.990
There's no post-syncing done
here at all in the film.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.210
And they could play essentially
versions of

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.440
themselves.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.510
And so when you see this first
frag, Frag 10, which is

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.370
literally being released today
for the first time--

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.080
we've been releasing them every
Thursday over the past

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.620
several months--

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.410
they're doing a scene that has
dramatic import to it.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.890
And there's some
truth in there.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:12.960
There's some fiction in there.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.470
But you're not quite sure
which one it is.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.420
It actually goes back to the
style of Italian neo-realism

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.945
more, the films of
John Cassavetes.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.544
Why don't we just watch Frag 10,
and then we can talk about

00:03:24.544 --> 00:03:24.839
it from there.

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:34.619

watch Frag 10.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.450
THEODORE PAGANO: Why do I get
a guilt trip for this?

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.410
JOHN PHILIPPIDIS: Ted,
you called once.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.910
THEODORE PAGANO: Yeah, when
you got out of hospital.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.040
Did you want me to call you
while you're in the hospital?

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.450
The thing about calling people
when they're in a coma, John,

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.700
it's not exactly stimulating
conversation.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.370
STEVEN DELOPOULOS: Ted,
he's got a point.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.920
THEODORE PAGANO: I don't
think he has a point.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:56.600

least pick up the phone or

THEODORE PAGANO: This is not
for me to [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.830
JOHN PHILIPPIDIS: Ted, you and
I were in Brazil together

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.670
playing for 80,000 people and
then poof, you're gone.

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.180
THEODORE PAGANO: Yeah, and
then it ended John.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.725
Everything ends.

00:04:03.725 --> 00:04:05.860
No poof-- it's not like
I broke the band up.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.086
We broke up, and I got
in with my life.

00:04:09.086 --> 00:04:10.290
What did you want?

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.500
Why is this being
pinned on me?

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.460
Why are I at fault for this?

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.260
Blame Marcus.

tore us apart.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.716
You're always sticking
up for this guy?

00:04:20.716 --> 00:04:22.144
JOHN PHILIPPIDIS: I'll have to
agree with Teddy on that one.

00:04:22.144 --> 00:04:25.000
STEVEN DELOPOULOS: Come
on, the guy's dead.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.230

JOHN PHILIPPIDIS: Steve,
the guy's dead.

You stick up for him like he's
a saint because he's dead.

STEVEN DELOPOULOS: I didn't
say he was a saint.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.370
JOHN PHILIPPIDIS: God
rest his soul.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.810
I mean, there was a time where
he was a friend to us but

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.996
mainly he was just
a street hustler.

00:04:39.996 --> 00:04:41.300
STEVEN DELOPOULOS: Yeah, well
we probably need a street

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.491
hustler again if we
want to get this

he just wore us out.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.110
drama works.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:36.990
And it allowed the guys
to pull from their own

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:41.429
experiences, which is in the
genre of neo-realism that's

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:44.049
something that you try to do.

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:46.540
And it's a really fun thing,
because you get an

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:50.920
authenticity that is there and
yet you're still playing with

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.370
a fictional story so you
can make it go where

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:54.250
you want it to go.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:58.160
And one of the other things
with the whole genre of

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.650
PopFictionLife is we're

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:02.370
integrating music as narrative.

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:06.950
It really is taking the idea of
what music video has been

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:10.570
and become and blending it
into narrative even more

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:11.920
organically.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.650
And I just love music as the
inspiration for cinema,

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:18.710
because really for me, the
most pure cinema is just

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:20.820
picture and music.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.880
And so this is sort of like a
dream come true for me to

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.720
create something that
had a musical story.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.430
And the emotions, you don't have
to necessarily have a lot

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:33.020
of dramatic scenes to
convey the emotions

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:33.970
because the music does.

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:36.380
And of course these guys are
such great musicians and are

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:40.700
able to play their instruments
live and do it real that it

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:41.810
give it that authenticity.

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:44.850
I think that in internet content
in general, people are

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:45.625
looking for authenticity.

00:09:45.625 --> 00:09:48.970
They're looking for something
that's more real, as opposed

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:51.690
to what you should get from
traditional Hollywood

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:52.530
entertainment.

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.450
FEMALE SPEAKER: Is that when you
chose to work with music

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:57.330
in particular for these
frag films?

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:58.500
BRETT LEONARD: Yeah.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:03.080
It goes back also to the films
of Hal Ashby of the '70s.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.460
If you think of Harold and
Maude, that was basically a

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:09.050
Cat Stevens album
put to a story.

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:12.550
Now would you think that Cat
Stevens would be able to carry

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:16.650
a story about a suicidal
teenager who has a love affair

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:18.080
with an 83-year-old woman?

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.720
Meaning, music and narrative
and cinema can do anything.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.540
They can create any combination
of things and

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:25.810
actually work.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:30.210
And so it allows me that
freedom as a filmmaker.

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:32.420
FEMALE SPEAKER: Do you plan on
keeping your frag films within

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:33.310
the musical realm?

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:36.110
BRETT LEONARD: PopFictionLife
itself, yes.

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:39.300
But we're going to be expanding
the genre to

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.400
incorporate other kinds
of subject matter.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.940
But I always probably will want
to incorporate music,

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:48.460
because you wouldn't necessarily
always have to

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:51.620
have a band starring in
a PopFictionLife film.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.590
This is a unique situation,
because I thought these guys

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:56.930
would be great at doing that.

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:58.020
We had a lot of fun doing it.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:04.230
So it was an opportunity to do
something that can combine.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.430
Those things came together
just perfectly.

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:08.280
FEMALE SPEAKER: We also
have Frag 11 to show.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.946
And that one actually
hasn't aired yet.

00:11:09.946 --> 00:11:11.000
It hasn't come out yet.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.360
BRETT LEONARD: Yeah.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.420
The Frag 10 just
came out today.

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.830
And Frag 11 is going to be
coming out Sunday when the

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:20.900
entire film is available on

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:24.260
PopFictionLife.com for that $5 purchase.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.583
If people like all
the 11 frags--

00:11:26.583 --> 00:11:27.470
FEMALE SPEAKER: And then they
can get the whole film.

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:28.660
BRETT LEONARD: And then you
could get the whole film where

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:30.460
you see how the story
turns out.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.430
So at the end of this frag is
where actually the three frags

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:35.930
end, meaning like a cliffhanger
of what's going to

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:36.870
happen in the story.

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:39.890
And then to see the third act
and all the other pieces of

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:42.000
the story, you get the
full feature film.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:50.848
So this Frag 11.

00:11:57.192 --> 00:11:59.144
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: I've called
you like eight times.

00:11:59.144 --> 00:12:00.608
Where have you been?

00:12:00.608 --> 00:12:02.072
THEODORE PAGANO: What do
mean where have I been?

00:12:02.072 --> 00:12:03.070
I'm working.

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:04.500
I'm out on the road here.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.325
I've been making calls
constantly.

00:12:06.325 --> 00:12:07.600
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: I understand
that you're working.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.830
But also understand that I'm
trying to get hold of you.

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:11.880
If you've got time to call other
people, then you've got

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.130
time to get back to me.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.670
THEODORE PAGANO: No, because I
don't sit by the phone and

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:18.690
wait for you to call all day.

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:21.370
I don't have the time to.

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:22.340
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: I'm
not asking you

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:23.290
to sit by the phone.

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:24.920
I'm just asking you to
send me one text.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:28.150
You're being really unreasonable
about this.

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:30.050
THEODORE PAGANO: Look,
if I don't do this,

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:31.090
it doesn't get done.

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:32.340
So I have to.

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:36.010
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: Well maybe
if you don't have time, I

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:36.655
don't have time.

00:12:36.655 --> 00:12:39.283
I'll just leave my phone
here, and I'll go out.

00:12:39.283 --> 00:12:41.250
STEVEN DELOPOULOS:
[INAUDIBLE].

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:43.200
THEODORE PAGANO: Oh, really?

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:43.850
Wonderful.

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:44.460
Thank you.

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:47.357
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: I'm going.

00:12:47.357 --> 00:12:48.854
THEODORE PAGANO: Fine.

00:12:48.854 --> 00:17:18.428
[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:18.428 --> 00:17:18.926
JOHN PHILIPPIDIS: Now what?

00:17:18.926 --> 00:17:20.440
MALE SPEAKER: Busted a hose.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.136
It'll take a little while
until I can fix it.

00:17:22.136 --> 00:17:23.386
JOHN PHILIPPIDIS: Great.

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:32.080
THEODORE PAGANO: Guys, we've
got to be at this funeral

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.330
service in a few hours.

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:35.220
JOHN PHILIPPIDIS: Ted, we're
going to be there just fine.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.100
THEODORE PAGANO: What do
you mean [INAUDIBLE]?

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:37.090
JOHN PHILIPPIDIS: At this point,
who cares about the

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:38.090
funeral service?

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:38.670
Really?

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:40.240
THEODORE PAGANO: What are
we here for then?

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.420
What didn't we just stay home?

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:42.140
JOHN PHILIPPIDIS: I didn't
have a choice

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:43.920
in the matter, Ted.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.756
STEVEN DELOPOULOS: Why didn't
you have a choice in the

00:17:45.756 --> 00:17:45.990
matter John?

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.340
JOHN PHILIPPIDIS: Steve.

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:47.300
STEVEN DELOPOULOS: What?

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:47.570
JOHN PHILIPPIDIS: I love you.

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:48.220
You're my cousin.

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:50.343
We're standing out in the middle
of the desert baking in

00:17:50.343 --> 00:17:52.080
the sun right now with a
broken down vehicle.

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.830
THEODORE PAGANO: What do you
think we owe this guy?

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:55.223
We don't owe him anything.

00:17:55.223 --> 00:17:56.110
STEVEN DELOPOULOS: Marcus?

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:56.250
THEODORE PAGANO: Yes, Marcus.

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:56.960
We don't owe him anything.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.740
STEVEN DELOPOULOS: We owe
Marcus everything, Ted.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:00.330
FEMALE SPEAKER: A
lot of tension

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:01.860
going on in that frag--

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.750
all sorts of trouble
on the horizon.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:04.370
BRETT LEONARD: Yeah.

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:08.720
The film is about them traveling
from Brooklyn to Los

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.870
Angeles for the funeral
of their ex-manager.

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:15.310
And the drama is around what
that ex-manager did and didn't

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:18.710
do for them, how they each feel
about him, and how they

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:20.020
feel about each other.

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:24.220
And it all comes down in the
third act, at the funeral.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.080
There's also a few
romantic glimmers

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.710
along the way, as well.

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:34.150
But it's really in a sense, a
gentle story that goes with

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:35.460
the feeling of the music.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:38.910
This is something that really
starts with the music for me

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:40.310
in terms of what that is.

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:42.620
And then we all met together.

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.870
And one of the aspects of this
you had mentioned, we were

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:47.480
showing it the colors, I
really wanted to create

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:52.370
something that had the look
and feel of a '70s movie.

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:54.980
The band had asked for that
when we first met.

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.700
And I was like, instantly
yes, let's do that.

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:02.010
Because HD, with the new cameras
we can do so many

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:03.490
interesting things with
available light

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:07.810
cinematography, and then
post-process with grain and do

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:10.320
very creative things that
you weren't able

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.140
to do in the past.

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:17.240
And so we celebrated that in
this film, utilizing those

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:21.900
kinds of looks and feels to
give it a different feel.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.860
So it's its own genre,
in a sense.

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:26.930
FEMALE SPEAKER: I want to talk
a little bit about what

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:30.060
PopFictionLife is and how
the frag film fits

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:31.370
into that new brand.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:34.500
And then we'll get back to the
band and music itself.

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.700
Tell us what PopFictionLife
is and what

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.470
it offers the consumer.

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:41.920
BRETT LEONARD: It's really
a way of creating and

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:49.870
distributing independent cinema
in a way that realizes

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:55.330
the reality of getting direct to
consumer, not going through

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:56.590
the distribution apparatus.

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:59.140
I mean, I worked in Hollywood
for over 25 years as a

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:00.620
director and producer.

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:03.260
And the business models of
Hollywood have changed

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.530
significantly in that time.

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:09.360
And primarily, especially for
most independent cinema, it's

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.540
very, very dysfunctional.

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:17.860
You have a very narrow sort of
window through which most

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.190
things get distributed and
how they distributed.

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:22.800
And there really is no reason
for that now that we're all

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.420
connected in the way we are.

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.630
So for people that want to
find different kinds of

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:29.210
content, it can still be very
high quality content.

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:32.930
It doesn't always have to just
be cats falling out of trees.

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:37.070
And I think we're leaving that
era of internet content and

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:38.970
moving into much higher
quality content.

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:41.720
Across the board, there's a lot
of people doing that now.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:45.210
But PopFictionLife is
specifically designed to also

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:50.410
allow the idea of frags or being
able to absorb content

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:54.110
through fragments, because it
started for me watching my

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:57.820
young son and how he looked
at films and content.

00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.250
It's an ADD generation--

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:01.740
there's an ADD aspect to
our culture going on.

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:03.920
And people sometimes
will go just watch

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.740
one scene of a movie.

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:07.140
Now, that's not me.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:09.722
I like to go watch the four hour
version of Lawrence of

00:21:09.722 --> 00:21:13.230
Arabia once a year, because
I just love that kind of

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:13.880
cinematic experience.

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:17.060
But that's not really where the
entire culture is going.

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:22.280
And so in recognizing that,
fragmenting story.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.400
You could even watch these
frags out of order.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.240
You can watch them in any way.

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.110
You could watch one or two, and
then get excited about the

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:28.830
story, then go get
the whole film.

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:33.060
So we're trying to giving the
digital content consumer a

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:38.680
greater choice in how
they absorb content.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.730
And also, one of the biggest
things we're going to be

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:43.990
doing, my partner Christopher
[? Creber ?]

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:47.160
is heading up the interactive
side of PopFictionLife.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:51.570
And frags are designed to
create interactivity.

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:53.200
If you look at some of the stuff
that's happened here

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:57.780
Google with Chris Milk and what
he did with Arcade Fire.

00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:00.250
Frags are designed to have
interactivity with them and

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:03.670
yet still maintain the integrity
of being a full

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:05.010
independent feature film.

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:05.750
FEMALE SPEAKER: How
does that work?

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:09.290
How does the interactivity
between the users work?

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:10.790
BRETT LEONARD: Well that's
a big question, isn't it?

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:12.910
That's what everyone's trying
to figure out these days.

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:15.980
I think one, obviously
integration into social media,

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.490
which we're doing a lot
of is very important.

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:20.950
So that people can discuss
and talk about things.

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:24.610
It's also about showing how this
kind of content can be

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:27.410
made, because it can be made
very, very, very cost

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:29.680
effectively and yet
at a high quality.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:33.780
And all the tools are coming
down to really a generation

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:36.280
that I believe is going to
be communicating through

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:38.470
cinematic language
much more than

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:40.070
almost any other language.

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:43.960
And in a sense, cinematic
language is a global language.

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:48.250
And so by doing these kinds of
projects, using the expertise

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:50.700
of Hollywood filmmaking, but
sort of doing it in the same

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:53.350
way that a lot of very young
filmmakers out there.

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:56.450
I basically mentor and employ
a lot of young filmmakers to

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:58.120
make these films.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:01.340
Because the way they are
integrating with the tools,

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:03.710
the way they think about
cinema, is completely

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:05.860
different than my generation.

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:10.040
And it's very exciting to me,
because I think it's about the

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.470
march of cinematic language
moving forward and becoming

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:14.850
truly interactive.

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:17.930
Gaming is obviously becoming
more and more cinematic and

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:18.910
yet is very interactive.

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:22.330
I think there's so many more
places to go with that that

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:24.940
aren't just in these narrow
areas that are

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:26.140
happening right now.

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.870
And you can do interactivity
with emotions.

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:30.640
You can do interactivity
with the way in

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.310
which you create something.

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:35.610
That alone and integrating with
a community of people

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:40.630
that are making content with
tools that allow them to make

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:43.220
it compelling.

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:44.890
Because it is a language.

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:47.420
It's not just an art
form at this point.

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:54.170
Every language started as an
art form and then became

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:56.890
something more consistent
as a language over time.

00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:58.440
If you look at the printing
press, if you look at

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:01.200
calligraphy, all the things that
have developed over the

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:04.630
ages, and so I think cinema
is that global language.

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:08.710
And I happen to believe that
cinematic language has a great

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:09.980
hope to it, because it

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:11.800
translates across all barriers.

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:16.340
And so if you can teach people
how to create compelling

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:20.680
cinematic language and also get
it out there in a way that

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:24.350
can truly find its audience,
there's great things that can

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:24.740
happen there.

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:31.340
We've obviously seen certain
things like, Facebook movies

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:34.430
and things that are showing that
this is something that's

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:37.230
really developing in the
global mind frame.

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:38.730
And it's an exciting time.

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:40.230
So this is a reaction.

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:43.270
PopFictionLife is a reaction
to all that.

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:46.220
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's also very
interactive for sponsors and

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:47.280
advertisers.

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:51.190
How does that work so that it
doesn't detract the viewer

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:52.850
from the film itself?

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:56.410
BRETT LEONARD: Well I think
pre-roles and all that, we're

00:24:56.410 --> 00:25:00.190
in this first stage of
internet advertising.

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:03.770
And I think that truly more
integrated advertising or

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:06.840
sponsorship that doesn't impinge
on the integrity of

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:10.650
what the content is is becoming
more and more the

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:12.790
norm, because that's what
the consumer wants.

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:14.550
That's what the people want.

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:18.070
The generation that consumes
internet content doesn't like

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:20.590
it to be slapped
in their face.

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:23.850
And yet there's a lot of
competing forces in that.

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:26.830
There's no one answer to
any of these things

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:28.660
you're talking about.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.860
One of things that we talk about
with PopFictionLife--

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:36.020
it's a fluid, digital company,
meaning we are reacting to

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:37.510
what's happening out there.

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:41.320
And the one thing I know is
how to create a cinematic

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:44.320
story, and how to do that in a
compelling way, and how to

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.130
make it look good.

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:49.310
So by creating things as cost
effectively as possible,

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:53.720
getting them out there without
a middleman, and empowering

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.670
the consumer, and then
also the creator.

00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:57.760
Content creators and consumers
who are becoming one in the

00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:59.830
same thing.

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:01.380
There's a lot of
entrepreneurial

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:01.950
opportunities in that.

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:04.660
I think that sponsors and
advertisers are starting to

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:05.210
recognize that.

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:09.550
Although they move slower than
you would possibly imagine.

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:11.080
FEMALE SPEAKER: But wouldn't
most of the funding

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:12.280
be coming from them?

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.000
And so they're obviously really

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.270
important to the process.

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:18.230
BRETT LEONARD: We've raised our
own money to fund these

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:20.920
initially, because again, we're
just trying to create an

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:24.220
entire package of this
is the idea.

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:26.750
And then we've had interest from
a number of sponsors and

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:28.810
advertisers that say, hey, this
is something if you've

00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:33.420
got someone like this kind
of name to do this.

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:38.120
And obviously, larger mega-acts
or things like that

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.020
would drive that more.

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:42.280
But I think that there's ways of
doing this without it being

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:45.540
driven just by three
or four names.

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:48.540
I think that this is something
that can fragment out, so to

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:52.210
speak, in a much more
diffused manner.

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:53.610
FEMALE SPEAKER: In terms of
marketing, you call those

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:55.470
diffuse distribution
versus vertical.

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:57.260
What exactly does it mean
and how does it work

00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:58.530
in different markets?

00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:01.690
BRETT LEONARD: Well, because we
parse things in frags, it

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:03.720
gives us the opportunity
to do them in all kinds

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.080
of different ways.

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:07.960
The interesting thing about
the internet in terms of

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.960
distributing independent cinema
too is it's not like

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.770
it's there in your local theater
for a weekend and

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:14.880
you've got to go see it.

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.680
It's once it's there,
the local theater is

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.530
there all the time.

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:22.730
So we can then release these
frags in different ways--

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:27.250
do contests around frags, do
things that talk about, do you

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:28.290
like to look at this one.

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:29.890
How do we do that?

00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:33.570
Bore down and drill down into
deeper interactivity with the

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:34.960
content creators that
are out of there

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:35.780
that are also consumers.

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:39.190
So this is all stuff that we're
developing right now.

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:42.880
We wanted to start by making a
frag film that was compelling

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:45.176
and for a broad audience,
and that's what The

00:27:45.176 --> 00:27:46.410
Other Country is.

00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:48.850
FEMALE SPEAKER: So now, you guys
as a band have a really

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:49.720
interesting story.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:52.790
You had a successful debut album
and then you disappeared

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:53.550
for 10 years.

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:56.220
And now you're back with
a self-titled album.

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:58.240
What encouraged you
guys to come back

00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.100
and get back together?

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.280
And what were you able to bring
to this record after a

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:05.590
10 year hiatus?

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:06.230
THEODORE PAGANO:
What encouraged

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:09.190
us to get back together?

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:12.070
We always all did music.

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:13.450
STEVEN DELOPOULOS:
Yoga, I think--

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:14.200
THEODORE PAGANO: Yeah.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:15.450
STEVEN DELOPOULOS: Helped
homelessness.

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:20.200
When you walk into a Starbucks,
and you saw an

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:24.080
application for a job, then you
think maybe we should--

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:27.140
JOHN PHILIPPIDIS: Steven and
I are cousins, and so we've

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:28.700
always played together.

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:30.710
And that never ended.

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:32.790
And Teddy was out in the
UK for a little bit.

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:36.200
So I think what the inspiration
really was just we

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:36.830
had done it.

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:38.250
We had had some success.

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:41.070
But there were definitely things
that we wanted to do

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:43.790
that we never did then, because
we were too green and

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:45.850
inexperienced.

00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:49.390
And so there is definitely
a fire under all

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:50.660
of us to do it again.

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:52.430
The question was, were we
actually going to do.

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:56.700
And a few different situations
led us all to getting back

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:58.130
together again.

00:28:58.130 --> 00:28:59.870
STEVEN DELOPOULOS: Teddy
was living in England--

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:00.570
the drummer--

00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:02.040
and he came back.

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:05.250
Me and Johnny were playing
music continuously.

00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:08.690
And I had written
all the songs.

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:09.400
We have the songs.

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:10.510
We had most of them.

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:15.620
We had a basement to start
rehearsing and a manager and a

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:17.220
label that was interested
in signing us.

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:18.280
And we just went for it.

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:20.140
JOHN PHILIPPIDIS: We sort of
went backwards, because we had

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:23.150
some success and then came back
to just almost starting

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:24.400
over again.

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:28.930
Teddy thought that we might
score another deal, but Steven

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:31.130
and I were just like,
we're old.

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:33.730
Who's going to sign us again?

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:36.090
We were picked up
by Sony Jive.

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:38.630
It was almost like lightning
striking twice.

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:41.026
STEVEN DELOPOULOS: Once we hit
19, it was like, it's over.

00:29:41.026 --> 00:29:41.740
JOHN PHILIPPIDIS:
It's over, yeah.

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:42.630
STEVEN DELOPOULOS: It's all
downhill from here.

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:43.530
JOHN PHILIPPIDIS:
Yeah, exactly.

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:45.110
FEMALE SPEAKER: Now how did
you get meet with Brett?

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:46.890
How did this all come about?

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:53.740
STEVEN DELOPOULOS: Our manager
knew Brett's partner and we

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:57.230
all met in LA at a really
cool diner.

00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:58.350
What was the diner called?

00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:59.190
BRETT LEONARD: Jerry's Deli.

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:00.240
STEVEN DELOPOULOS: Jerry's
Deli, yeah.

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.820
It's really, really
good actually.

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:02.770
THEODORE PAGANO: It's just
a little cool diner.

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:07.450
STEVEN DELOPOULOS: And we sat
down with Brett and just had a

00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:08.270
conversation.

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:11.870
And we actually were all
a little starstruck.

00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:17.130
We knew who he was, and were
very excited to meet him, and

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:20.710
dumbfounded why he was
talking to us.

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:22.220
FEMALE SPEAKER: Brett, why were
you talking to you guys?

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:24.980
BRETT LEONARD: I listened
to the album.

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:29.100
I didn't want to choose who I
was doing this first frag film

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:33.530
with based upon anything but
just responding to the music

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:35.720
and responding to who
the people are.

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.850
Because that's one of the things
that just drives me

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:42.780
crazy, the hierarchy of how
content happens it isn't a

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:44.470
true meritocracy.

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:47.120
And so I just want to
respond to that.

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.530
I love the album.

00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:51.080
And I just saw, wow, I could
make a movie from this.

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:54.520
And they're so authentic in the
fact, when I went and saw

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:57.870
them after we met and saw them
perform live the first time,

00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:00.130
that I was truly hooked.

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:03.210
Because I wanted to do something
where you didn't

00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:05.880
have to, in a sense, fake
the music in any

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.250
way, shape or form.

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:10.400
And there's not one moment of
fake music in this movie.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:14.680
It's purely capturing them in
their live performance, which

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:17.056
is truly wonderful.

00:31:17.056 --> 00:31:19.260
They're very virtuosic in
they're performance.

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:21.940
FEMALE SPEAKER: And it's very
unique to have completely live

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:23.800
music in a film.

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:26.120
Was that liberating
for you guys?

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:28.070
Or was that difficult?

00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:30.860
Were you worried that there's
no post-production?

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:31.660
THEODORE PAGANO: No.

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:34.220
That's the type of
band that we are.

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:36.600
We don't use electronics.

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:40.440
We're very much like
a '70s folk band.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:41.640
We get together to play.

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:43.240
We have chemistry
with each other.

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.260
And that's our thing.

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:45.180
So it's quite natural for us.

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:47.140
FEMALE SPEAKER: So it was kind
of liberating for you guys.

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:47.250
It was just all natural.

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:47.740
THEODORE PAGANO: Yeah.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:49.230
We just did our thing.

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:51.570
JOHN PHILIPPIDIS: It was
actually nice, because the

00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:56.250
record that Brett heard
was all recorded--

00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:58.360
Pro-tools was used as the
medium just because it's

00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.580
cheaper to capture it there.

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:03.620
But the computer screen was
not allowed in the room.

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:07.050
There was no auto-tuning
and no editing.

00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:07.681
FEMALE SPEAKER: Which is so
cool and completely unique

00:32:07.681 --> 00:32:07.920
these day, I feel like.

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:08.300
JOHN PHILIPPIDIS: There
was no nudging.

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:09.090
Yeah.

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:10.260
It was just live.

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:14.100
And the fact that they were
going to capture it that way,

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:15.930
that's all we know
how to do anyway.

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:20.740
So post-production to us
is not really even a--

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:22.430
BRETT LEONARD: Burlap to
Cashmere for me, was a band

00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:26.000
that deserved to have
a movie made.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.950
And I just wanted that to be the
reason, because we're not

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:31.120
spending millions of dollars
doing these.

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.080
We're spending hundreds of
thousands of dollars, but

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:34.080
we're not spending millions
of dollars.

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.930
So there's a liberating
aspect to that.

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:39.260
And independent cinema used
to be about that.

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:42.000
It used to be about doing
something truly authentic.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.600
As I mentioned John Cassavetes,

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.060
he's one of my heroes.

00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:48.440
And if you go back and see the
things he talked about, about

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:52.280
what drove him to make the
cinema he did, that is me

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.980
returning to those roots.

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:56.995
Even though I hadn't done these
kinds of films before, I

00:32:56.995 --> 00:33:00.150
had done films that were much
more visual effect oriented

00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:00.800
and all that.

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:05.450
So really for me, it was a
liberating experience from

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:07.170
doing a different
kind of cinema.

00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:09.940
And because they're so
authentic, and then they were

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:13.000
able to play versions of
themselves very authentically,

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.540
it was again, this great
confluence of things.

00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:17.670
FEMALE SPEAKER: And a very
unique experienced for

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:19.170
everyone, I'm sure.

00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:21.120
Now, guys, when you first heard
about the frag film

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:22.820
concept, what was
your reaction?

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:25.990
How did you feel that it would
assist musicians or the music

00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:28.290
genre in general?

00:33:28.290 --> 00:33:30.145
THEODORE PAGANO: We struggled to
understand it at first and

00:33:30.145 --> 00:33:33.120
I think a lot of people do.

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:38.730
The idea of it a manager said,
so we have this on Friday, and

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:41.150
then there's this, and then, oh
we might be making a movie.

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:42.510
We're like, what.

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:43.760
STEVEN DELOPOULOS:
Pass the salt.

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:48.770
THEODORE PAGANO: So he tried
to explain it as best as he

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:51.600
could, but we didn't really
understand it until we met

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.350
with Brett and he
explained it.

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:55.465
BRETT LEONARD: That's one of the
reasons I just went ahead

00:33:55.465 --> 00:33:56.940
and made the film.

00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:00.240
Because I wanted to show, until
we have all the frags

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.410
out there and then we release
the film, now everyone's

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:03.100
starting to get it.

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:03.370
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's easier
to wrap your head around.

00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:06.640
BRETT LEONARD: People were
going, oh I see.

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:09.139
Oh, you're giving it
away for free.

00:34:09.139 --> 00:34:14.239
All of those ideas are counter
to the way in which Hollywood

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:19.179
cinema distribution has worked
for forever that it's new.

00:34:19.179 --> 00:34:22.760
But that for me, is
why I get up.

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:25.880
That's what drives me is to do
something new and different

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:29.610
that can empower both people
that watch films and also

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:30.659
people that make them.

00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:32.409
FEMALE SPEAKER: My first
question when I started doing

00:34:32.409 --> 00:34:35.690
the research was, how does it
differ from a trailer or a

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:37.170
teaser for a film?

00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:42.409
BRETT LEONARD: Essentially, it's
making the film be a lot

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:44.330
of teasers, a lot of trailers.

00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:47.770
And you're seeing this
happen in bigger

00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:49.530
studio films, as well.

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:53.000
You're seeing secondary material
being put out before

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.830
big films like Prometheus,
things that are put out as--

00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:57.430
FEMALE SPEAKER: People
want [? even more. ?]

00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:57.720
BRETT LEONARD: Yeah.

00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:58.630
They want [? even more. ?]

00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:01.810
And so this is a way of doing
it with more independent

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:06.610
cinema and giving away even more
so that if you like it,

00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:08.420
then it's authentic that
you want to buy it.

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:10.710
It's not like, to see that
big movie I've got to

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:13.850
spend $19.95 on iTunes.

00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:16.795
And I think that's not going to
be the way that independent

00:35:16.795 --> 00:35:18.760
cinema works in the future.

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:21.290
FEMALE SPEAKER: What is the
overall theme of this

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:21.980
particular film?

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:24.440
What is the message?

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:27.320
BRETT LEONARD: Well again, it
comes out of the music for me.

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:32.400
I'm sure that the musicians
themselves would have a more

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:35.430
deep answer in terms of where
the music comes from.

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:39.730
But for me, it was about
this journey.

00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:41.860
And so we created a journey,
in a sense.

00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:44.710
But Steven could probably speak
to that better than me.

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:45.860
STEVEN DELOPOULOS: Brett
had it right.

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:48.880
I think when Brett wanted to do
the project first, it was

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.000
about The Other Country.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.350
It was about the other side.

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:55.660
And I believe we had a
conversation about close

00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:57.670
family or friends who
had passed on, and

00:35:57.670 --> 00:36:00.420
that was our bond.

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:06.610
And I think the film really was
inspired and like, well,

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:08.620
what happens to those people
that you love and that are so

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:10.980
close to you and you lose them,
and they die, or they

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:12.410
leave and this and that.

00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:18.730
And so The Other Country was
this antidote to that reality

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:21.980
that as human beings, we all
have to go through and face.

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:26.370
And I think Brett was really,
really keen on making that the

00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:30.880
focal point in the film.

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:37.120
When I wrote the music, the
lyrics were the focal point of

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:41.660
I see the other country, just
basically like, it's the

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:45.360
ultimate near death experience
record, hopefully.

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:47.610
And I think Brett got
that and wanted to

00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:48.980
capture it, and he did.

00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:52.080
BRETT LEONARD: And I think
because we made it a journey

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:56.490
across this country, and we've
been in a lot of interesting

00:36:56.490 --> 00:36:58.280
foment in this country lately.

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:02.130
There's a bit of for me, also a
political angle there that's

00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:03.980
expressed in purely
the visuals.

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:05.740
It's not something that we
put in the narrative.

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:08.130
It's purely expressed in
the cinematic language.

00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:09.030
FEMALE SPEAKER: What is it?

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:14.170
BRETT LEONARD: Well, just that
there's more than one America.

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:16.470
And even moreso now than
ever we see that.

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:19.920
But if you go back and you watch
Lincoln, you'll see it's

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:22.100
been that way for
very long time.

00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:26.320
And so for me, all those themes
that were more mystical

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:33.900
in nature also reflect in the
overall geography and nature

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:34.320
of this country.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.240
And I've traveled across
the country.

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:38.380
I hitchhiked across the country
when I was a teenager.

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:43.280
I love traveling America,
because it literally is like

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:47.220
traveling through multiple
countries.

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:50.320
And people from outside of here
see that even moreso than

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:52.020
people that come from here.

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:54.660
And so I wanted to express that
but not in an overhanded

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:59.550
way, just in a way that was
touched in inside the visual

00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:00.460
language of the film.

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:01.720
FEMALE SPEAKER: I definitely
thought what you're saying

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:05.170
through some of the frags that
I watched on the website when

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:06.450
you guys are playing
in the club.

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:09.295
And it's a bunch of hillbillies
and at first they

00:38:09.295 --> 00:38:10.200
don't know what's going on.

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.470
And you're like, oh great,
we've got to do this.

00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:14.160
And then they totally
get the vibe.

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:15.420
So it was really interesting.

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:16.970
BRETT LEONARD: That frag
you're talking

00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:18.630
about is frag two.

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:21.540
Those are real people.

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:25.770
For me, again, the neo-realism
format of going in and just

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:28.090
going into a bar literally
saying, we're going to buy

00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:29.090
drinks for everybody.

00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:30.020
Come on down.

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:32.570
Those are just real people
responding in a real way to

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:33.990
hear music as they played it.

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:36.970
JOHN PHILIPPIDIS: And Brett
literally would like just, OK.

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:39.340
And he'd leave us out in
a pit of scorpions.

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:41.512
And he'd be like, now react.

00:38:41.512 --> 00:38:44.550
Oh, what the hell's going on?

00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:47.980
BRETT LEONARD: It is
a dicey thing.

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:51.200
In the film, Johnny tells a
story that comes from a very

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:54.620
personal and traumatic
event of his life.

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:57.470
You only get to see that story
if you see the whole film.

00:38:57.470 --> 00:39:03.300
But there's courage in doing a
film like this, because you

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:06.870
have to expose even more of
yourself as a performer.

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:09.860
So in a way, even though they're
primarily musicians,

00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:13.350
as performers, as actors so to
speak, they had to expose

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:16.340
themselves greater than
most actors do in

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:17.180
a traditional film.

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:20.890
So there's a real frision
that takes place there.

00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:22.030
And I think that's unique.

00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:25.240
I think that authenticity is
something people can find and

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:26.430
respond to.

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:27.050
FEMALE SPEAKER: I agree.

00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:28.600
I think this whole concept
is very unique.

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:31.460
And we discussed what it offers
the consumer as well as

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:32.210
the advertiser.

00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:34.750
What about the independent
content creator?

00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:37.110
What does the frag
film offer them?

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:40.520
BRETT LEONARD: Where we're
taking PopFictionLife is to

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:47.120
create a content creation
community that we're going to

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:49.770
get under the hood with how
we're creating these films,

00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:52.410
because we're doing them very,
very differently than

00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:53.260
traditional Hollywood
productions.

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:58.730
In fact, most Hollywood
production is utilizing the

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:01.550
methodology of 1935
production.

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:05.270
The forms, the way in which--

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:08.670
they shoot the show
Californication right next

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:10.920
door to me in Venice,
California.

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:12.210
And I love that show,
by the way.

00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:12.820
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's
a good show.

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:14.870
BRETT LEONARD: It's mostly
people talking in rooms or

00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:16.280
doing something in rooms.

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:22.300
And it's 15 trucks,
200 people.

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:25.490
They're blowing up an anthill
with a nuclear bomb.

00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:29.540
And its ridiculous that with
the technology we have for

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:33.690
image acquisition and post
production, that the way in

00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:37.620
which Hollywood films are made
makes no logical sense to any

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:39.790
kind of true manufacturing
process.

00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:41.150
FEMALE SPEAKER: Gotta do
something with the budget.

00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:42.280
BRETT LEONARD: Well,
that's the thing.

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:44.330
That makes no sense to--

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:47.100
and sometimes, I'm like the
crazy hippie film director.

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:48.685
I'm going, I'm more conservative
than you guys

00:40:48.685 --> 00:40:51.360
are, because you just want
to spend more money.

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:52.980
I don't understand
why, because you

00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:54.770
get one less freedom.

00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:57.410
You have to make everything
get dumbed down

00:40:57.410 --> 00:40:59.140
to a certain degree.

00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:04.100
And so to make films a very
different way, and in a sense,

00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:08.460
I'm following my son Shannon,
who is turning 18 on the night

00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:10.820
when this film was released.

00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:13.800
And I started watching him
when he was about 10.

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.330
He started making content
himself, not

00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:15.940
that I pushed him.

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:16.490
I didn't.

00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:18.630
He just started doing it, and I
was like, boy, you're really

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:20.330
doing this differently.

00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:22.360
And I realized, this
is the future.

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:26.450
And so I started going in that
direction with how I was

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:27.820
producing films.

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:29.790
And we're going to open
the coffers of that.

00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:33.370
We're going to bring a community
together that's

00:41:33.370 --> 00:41:35.685
doing that and create something
we call the

00:41:35.685 --> 00:41:39.520
frag-plex, which is make your
own frags and market them

00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:42.060
through this community
of people, as well.

00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:44.030
So there's not just production,
but also

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:49.800
distribution and marketing all
in one open-sourced idea of

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:50.870
production and distribution.

00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:53.300
Because again, as I said,
cinematic language is

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:56.730
something that needs to be more
broad based then just

00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:59.160
about the things that Hollywood
makes about.

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:01.310
Again, there's nothing wrong
with big Hollywood movies.

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:02.790
I love them.

00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:06.050
There's something greater
there to be explored.

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:07.850
FEMALE SPEAKER: Now for those
people that want to learn how

00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:10.140
to make these frag films, where
do they go and learn?

00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:12.010
Do they go to
PopFictionLife.com?

00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:13.240
BRETT LEONARD: Yes.

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:15.655
We're going to start creating
a an overall community.

00:42:15.655 --> 00:42:16.020
FEMALE SPEAKER: Tutorials?

00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:17.970
BRETT LEONARD: It's not
really tutorials.

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:19.510
It's more like open forums.

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:22.920
And it's giving them access
to my core group and then

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:25.230
extending out from there and
then finding other people that

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:29.080
have core competencies, because
there's so many people

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:31.370
that are super talented.

00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:34.130
I mean, if you go on Vimeo and
look at some of the amazing

00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:35.610
pieces that are on there.

00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:37.410
There's so much talent
out there.

00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:42.220
And there's only one tiny route
that some of that talent

00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:44.270
gets to actually make
Hollywood films.

00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:46.760
I happen to be a person that
pushed through that, because

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:48.780
I'm just a crazy,
tenacious dude.

00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:53.860
But if you don't have that kind
of intense obsession,

00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:55.340
you're not going to
necessarily get

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:56.010
your stuff out there.

00:42:56.010 --> 00:42:59.420
And that to me, is a tragedy,
because I think there's so

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:03.480
much that can be expressed
through cinema that isn't.

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:07.730
And so PopFictionLife with its
interactivity, with utilizing

00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:11.710
interactive technology that
allows you to connect with a

00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:15.130
community of people, market with
a community of people,

00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:18.160
and distribute it, and find out
what people respond to and

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:18.680
what they don't.

00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:22.860
So it's in a sense, almost
like a Hollywood 2.0.

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:26.330
It's a different environment
to do content in.

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:29.760
And yet, it's still serious
content creation.

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.940
It's not just frivolous
content creation.

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:34.490
FEMALE SPEAKER: Now, part
of the frag film--

00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:36.360
a big part of it-- is the
cinematic quality.

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:38.540
And that's what you talk
about quite a bit.

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.885
Once you have all these other
people creating these frag

00:43:40.885 --> 00:43:42.370
films, how do you control
the cinematic

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:43.440
quality at that point?

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:45.080
BRETT LEONARD: Well, you
don't control it.

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:46.330
Control is overrated.

00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:53.000
There's a meritocracy that will
happen that is actually

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.640
very much an inherent part
of internet content.

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:58.090
Obviously, there's certain
aspects of internet content

00:43:58.090 --> 00:44:01.990
that always will be the freak
show or something that just

00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:03.240
grabs hold.

00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:09.070
If people can find it and if
they can respond to it, then

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:11.120
that's what's going to
rise to the top.

00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:13.830
And it's something that I think
we're moving through

00:44:13.830 --> 00:44:17.060
this first phase as I said, of
internet content and moving

00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:18.720
into a more mature phase.

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:19.880
It's still going to take time.

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:23.060
This is all very young and in
the beginning stages, but

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:23.970
that's what's exciting
about it.

00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:25.930
Again, there's no rules.

00:44:25.930 --> 00:44:28.220
We're not saying we know
every single answer.

00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:31.270
As a matter of fact, that's one
of the strengths of what

00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:33.450
the PopFictionLife
concept is about.

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:35.560
It's going to be very fluid.

00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:36.450
FEMALE SPEAKER: What
is your dream?

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:38.100
How far do you see
the frag film,

00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:39.930
PopFictionLife concept going?

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:41.260
What is the future of it?

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:44.190
BRETT LEONARD: It's
an organic thing.

00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:46.660
I'm doing it, in a sense, like
I said, for my son--

00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:49.930
for his generation of
content creators.

00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:53.250
They have a different motivation
for making content.

00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:55.430
I mean, when I grew up in
Toledo, Ohio, my motivation

00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:58.750
was to get to Hollywood and
make big feature films.

00:44:58.750 --> 00:45:02.390
That era is sort of changing.

00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:05.410
Now that you're able to make
really high quality content

00:45:05.410 --> 00:45:10.660
with cameras this big or our
phones, there were things in

00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:12.690
that last frag that were all
shot with the iPhone.

00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:15.300
And then we had to degrade them
to actually make them

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:22.430
look like the aesthetic
correlation with

00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:24.730
the rest of the film.

00:45:24.730 --> 00:45:27.050
It's just such an era where all
the cards have been thrown

00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:27.960
in the air.

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:29.930
And so we're just trying to
take advantage of that, be

00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:33.720
opportunistic, be
entrepreneurial, and provide

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:36.240
routes for other people.

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:39.960
Essentially, there's a mentoring
aspect to this.

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:42.880
As I get older, as a filmmaker,
I've gotten a lot

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:44.600
of my dreams as a filmmaker.

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:48.050
I want to mentor a larger group
of people to be able to

00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:49.630
create their content, because
I really want to

00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:51.810
see what gets created.

00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:53.310
I love discovery.

00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:56.140
And so that's really
want I'm doing for.

00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:58.030
FEMALE SPEAKER: And I wanted to
ask all of you guys, what

00:45:58.030 --> 00:46:01.630
do you think is the future of
digital and media film and

00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:03.560
music industry in the
next 10 years?

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:04.810
What do you think is
going to happen?

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:09.280
THEODORE PAGANO: I think that's
a sub-topic of a whole

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:10.940
another Q&amp;A.

00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:14.250
JOHN PHILIPPIDIS: I think
personally that what Brett's

00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:20.440
doing here is giving a chance to
some of the younger, maybe

00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:25.270
frustrated artists out there who
would not get the ability

00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:29.610
to ever score a Hollywood
picture film.

00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:33.600
And with a lot of the bands that
I'm sure we all love, on

00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:36.160
the music end of it, I'm sure
most of the bands that

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:41.430
everybody here loves did not
follow the mold to get

00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:43.570
straight to a major
record company.

00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:45.980
They just happened to
have been good.

00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:48.790
So when you guys were talking
about controlling the content,

00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:51.780
I think the whole concept is,
don't control the content.

00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:57.750
Because that's how a lot of the
stuff that looks all the

00:46:57.750 --> 00:47:01.340
same gets massed together
and we're just fed it.

00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:03.900
And now we're stuck listening
to the same music, watching

00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:06.350
the same movies, and that's why
every time a trailer comes

00:47:06.350 --> 00:47:09.120
out, someone like me would
rather stay home than go to

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:11.280
see the flick, because nowadays
you don't know what

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:12.930
you're going to get
your hands on.

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:16.860
So I think that if the future
is heading this way, I would

00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:20.390
hope that it happens in the
music industry as well.

00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:23.620
Because as well as creating a
lot of people who maybe aren't

00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:28.630
filmmakers or aren't musicians,
it will actually

00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:32.080
give people the opportunity,
let's say who maybe never had

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:34.500
it before but should
be doing it.

00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:36.000
BRETT LEONARD: I think
it's a trend.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.606
I think there's an ache for
authenticity and an ache for

00:47:39.606 --> 00:47:39.870
something--

00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:42.860
we've been in a period
of deconstruction.

00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:45.830
And everything is about
deconstructing what has been

00:47:45.830 --> 00:47:49.350
the authentic stuff that
was and twist it, and

00:47:49.350 --> 00:47:50.390
turn it, and do it.

00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:53.130
But it's all the same.

00:47:53.130 --> 00:47:55.980
I think there's so many new
things that could be created

00:47:55.980 --> 00:48:00.520
if they were allowed a fertile
bed to be created.

00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:05.160
This is just one idea to help
create some of that

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:06.230
fertility--

00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:08.280
creative fertility.

00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:11.910
I'm sure there will be
many, many others.

00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:14.890
For me, it's not about ruling
the content world or

00:48:14.890 --> 00:48:15.600
anything like that.

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:20.142
It's about allowing a group of
people to get larger in an

00:48:20.142 --> 00:48:26.080
organic way that can create, and
distribute, and enjoy this

00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:27.100
new kind of cinema.

00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:30.200
And when I say cinema, I mean
music and cinema, really it's

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:31.550
all becoming one thing.

00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:34.010
I think one of the things
I wanted to do with

00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:37.200
PopFictionLife was bring back
the idea of the album

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:41.580
experience, which is, this is
a full album in this film.

00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:45.940
And because you have a story
with emotion, you want to

00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:49.030
listen to all the songs, because
they have context.

00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:52.370
As opposed to just the, it's
got to be a single.

00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:55.470
And there's nothing wrong
with a great single.

00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:58.470
I love a great single
with a great hook.

00:48:58.470 --> 00:48:59.570
And that's hard to do.

00:48:59.570 --> 00:49:02.650
But an album experience is
also very worthwhile.

00:49:02.650 --> 00:49:05.570
It goes back to when I was in
junior high and we listened to

00:49:05.570 --> 00:49:05.810
Dark Side of the Moon--

00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:06.050
FEMALE SPEAKER: Pink Floyd.

00:49:06.050 --> 00:49:08.070
The Wall.

00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:12.220
BRETT LEONARD: In a dark room
and I'll never forget that.

00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:16.270
I think by adding in cinematic
language to that kind of

00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:19.310
experience, everything
is a screen now.

00:49:19.310 --> 00:49:20.670
Everything is a screen.

00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:23.080
And those screens are
only multiplying.

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:25.915
And so the speakers are
this big, and the

00:49:25.915 --> 00:49:27.040
screens are this big.

00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:30.010
So you've got to create visual
content that goes with the

00:49:30.010 --> 00:49:33.340
music that's not
just fashion--

00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:36.030
what the music video is-- but
has actual true emotion and

00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:37.880
human truth in it.

00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:39.330
FEMALE SPEAKER: And in closing,
for those that want

00:49:39.330 --> 00:49:42.780
to follow the evolution of
PopFictionLife and the films

00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:46.090
that you guys are offering,
PopFictionLife.com offers all

00:49:46.090 --> 00:49:47.170
of the information
and the films.

00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:47.880
BRETT LEONARD: That's right.

00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:48.670
That's where you go.

00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:51.210
And we have a Facebook page.

00:49:51.210 --> 00:49:53.290
Go out there and like us.

00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:56.320
There's a newsletter and
all the usual stuff.

00:49:56.320 --> 00:50:00.105
And it's very much a
grassroots effort.

00:50:00.105 --> 00:50:02.015
FEMALE SPEAKER: Guys, thank you
so much for being here.

00:50:02.015 --> 00:50:02.290
I really appreciate it.

00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:02.940
STEVEN DELOPOULOS: Thanks
for having us.

00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:04.640
FEMALE SPEAKER: We're going to
open up the room for questions

00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:05.890
if anybody has questions.

00:50:08.648 --> 00:50:11.304
AUDIENCE: Can you give us some
examples of interactivity that

00:50:11.304 --> 00:50:13.960
you experienced so far,
especially with in terms with

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:16.616
interacting with bands, which
I would imagine that

00:50:16.616 --> 00:50:19.610
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:50:19.610 --> 00:50:22.320
BRETT LEONARD: We haven't
incorporated much.

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:25.230
The only interactivity has been
social media interaction

00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:25.760
at this point.

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:29.900
We want to utilize some of the
new technological things that

00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:34.400
allow interactivity that can
connect with additional

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:39.610
material, second screen
experiences.

00:50:39.610 --> 00:50:42.540
Obviously with different kinds
of music and different kinds

00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:44.350
of subject matter,
there's other

00:50:44.350 --> 00:50:46.140
opportunities that could come.

00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:49.680
This piece is a very organic
piece that comes directly from

00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:52.090
the organic nature of the
band and the music.

00:50:52.090 --> 00:50:55.940
As I said, they play
the music live.

00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:59.280
We didn't want to add on
interactivity on top of that

00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:01.540
in a way that was inappropriate
to the vibe of

00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:02.320
this particular piece.

00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:04.610
So this really is the
kernel for which.

00:51:04.610 --> 00:51:07.280
But I'm very, very interested
in interactivity.

00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:10.260
My son, who's part of that and
Christopher [? Creaver ?],

00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:14.690
who's heading that up,
their passion is

00:51:14.690 --> 00:51:16.780
finding ways to interact.

00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:20.570
We're developing some projects
that are more science fiction

00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:24.490
based, things like that that
are going to have a genre

00:51:24.490 --> 00:51:27.810
component to them that allows
much more interesting

00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:29.060
interactivity.

00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:32.150
FEMALE SPEAKER: Anybody else?

00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:33.420
BRETT LEONARD: And if there's
anyone at Google that wants to

00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:36.380
play with us, we're very
open to doing--

00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:40.310
I love what Chris Milk did with
the Arcade Fire piece.

00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:43.090
That was truly an emotional
use of interactivity.

00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:45.900
And so those are the kinds of
things that interest me.

00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:49.900
AUDIENCE: I just wanted to ask
you about the filming style

00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:51.900
that you used.

00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:54.400
In some places, it was like an
Instagram video and you used

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:55.650
the saturated colors.

00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:59.900
Why did you choose to do that?

00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:02.540
BRETT LEONARD: Well, I
started doing HD--

00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:04.790
I was one of the first people
to ever use HD--

00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:07.010
years, and years,
and years ago.

00:52:07.010 --> 00:52:13.320
So are the ability to post
process images, which

00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:17.000
Instagram is a consumer
version of, is been

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.730
around for a while.

00:52:18.730 --> 00:52:21.630
And that's a style I've been
developing with a lot of my HD

00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:23.520
projects in different ways.

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:25.140
This was very specific--

00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:28.070
using grain, using image
degradation, using those kinds

00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:29.320
of things as a style.

00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:35.430
We have a saying at [INAUDIBLE],
we'd push all the

00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:39.440
buttons just to try everything
that exists

00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:40.720
and see what works.

00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:43.200
Because I think there can
be a celebration of

00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:45.440
HD as its own aesthetic.

00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:48.250
I love film, and film is
a tremendous aesthetic.

00:52:48.250 --> 00:52:49.835
But HD is really a
different medium.

00:52:49.835 --> 00:52:53.240
It's like oils and acrylics.

00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:56.140
From a creative standpoint, I
think it could be pushed even

00:52:56.140 --> 00:53:00.620
more in terms of doing things
that truly make it unique to

00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:01.340
its own medium.

00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:03.737
And so we're trying
to do that.

00:53:03.737 --> 00:53:05.685
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
using an iPhone?

00:53:05.685 --> 00:53:07.640
What are some of the
other cameras?

00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:14.580
BRETT LEONARD: 5D, 7D because
this was no permits, complete

00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:15.300
guerrilla filmmaking.

00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:19.430
We did a whole scene by they're

00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:21.030
rehearsal basement in Brooklyn--

00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:22.910
in the street of Brooklyn--

00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:27.086
and suddenly there were all
these detectives around

00:53:27.086 --> 00:53:30.950
walking down the street going in
canvas because some murder

00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:31.910
that took place.

00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:34.450
And we're shooting a movie in
the middle of that, and not

00:53:34.450 --> 00:53:35.630
one of them batted an eye.

00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:38.230
Because with the 5D and 7D, it
looks like you're shooting

00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:39.520
skills, or whatever.

00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:42.380
And so the freedom of that,
which is very again, much the

00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:45.880
Cassavetes style and the
neo-realism style, it just

00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:49.870
allows again, an authenticity
that you just can't get with a

00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:51.530
different kind of
filming style.

00:53:51.530 --> 00:53:53.140
There are new cameras
coming up.

00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:55.630
Now, I would shoot a whole
one of these with

00:53:55.630 --> 00:53:58.540
just the iPhone now.

00:53:58.540 --> 00:54:00.100
These are great cameras.

00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:03.590
Image acquisition is not the
issue at this point.

00:54:03.590 --> 00:54:05.590
AUDIENCE: Also because you
weren't capturing sound.

00:54:05.590 --> 00:54:06.100
BRETT LEONARD: We were
capturing sound.

00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:07.710
AUDIENCE: You were capturing
sound on the iPhone?

00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:08.610
BRETT LEONARD: No, not
on the iPhone.

00:54:08.610 --> 00:54:10.620
We had separate sound.

00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:11.730
We had separate sound,
defintely.

00:54:11.730 --> 00:54:14.770
But the zoom--

00:54:14.770 --> 00:54:19.780
as mobile and as lean as
possible to get the quality.

00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:21.420
Again, it goes back
to expertise.

00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:23.740
One of the things that we want
to share with people is with

00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:26.690
these very, very simple tools,
if you have a certain

00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:30.570
expertise, you can make things
that are just as high quality

00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:31.580
as Hollywood does.

00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:32.620
It's just about the expertise.

00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:34.590
So you have to add
that layer in.

00:54:34.590 --> 00:54:36.730
And that's one of things
PopFictionLife wants to do.

00:54:36.730 --> 00:54:39.180
That's part of the interactivity
with the

00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:41.340
community, because
there are tricks.

00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:46.300
There's a lot of tricks that
you learn over the years.

00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:50.540
I just I just love the freedom
that these kinds of cameras

00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:51.700
and technologies allow.

00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:54.450
And it really has to get back
to getting something

00:54:54.450 --> 00:54:56.700
authentic, getting something
new, getting something that

00:54:56.700 --> 00:55:00.850
you discover while you're
making a film.

00:55:00.850 --> 00:55:03.260
FEMALE SPEAKER: Anybody else?

00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:03.690
OK.

00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:05.410
Well guys, thank you so
much for being here.

00:55:05.410 --> 00:55:07.670
I think this is a very brilliant
concept and very

00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:08.780
interesting.

00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:11.810
And maybe I'll get involved.

00:55:11.810 --> 00:55:14.000
