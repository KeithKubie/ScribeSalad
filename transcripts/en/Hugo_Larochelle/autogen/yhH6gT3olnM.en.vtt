00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 in this capsule we will see the concept 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:09.450
 of unification the unification is going to be 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:14.420
 the second tool that will need to 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.660
 to prove by resolution then 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.000
 the unification 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.600
 so what are we going to try to do with 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.090
 unification is from a pair 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.949
 of alphard literals and alpha 2 we're going 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.949
 try to find a substitution 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.740
 maybe time yes that will allow 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.710
 to unify half hour and alpha 2 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.620
 that is to say, is such that if I apply 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.600
 alpha 1 substitution and I have the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.270
 same alpha substitution 2 I'm going 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.090
 get exactly the same literal 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.879
 konqueror of it's heroes who are the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.680
 same who are equal so see example 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:56.250
 if I had the literal pf2 xyz and country 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:00.680
 is capitalized and I had the substitution 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:04.320
 y by f 2 x and z by a 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:07.610
 and well this substitution the head to 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.869
 would unify but literals here 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.670
 actually I'm here if I apply 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:19.170
 teta a pdf of exide so I have to 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.840
 replace z with z and replaced here by 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.600
 a change not since exit no 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.420
 involved in my substitution and if 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.840
 I'm applying teta ap from there 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:35.189
 I have to change seems blix so there is 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.430
 modified and then substituted by f 2 x and 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:44.759
 I actually get that f 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:47.040
 b2f of x1 here and pdf dx has here so i have 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:51.030
 managed to unify but 2 0 with my 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.119
 substitution has sometimes 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:58.200
 it's impossible to unify 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:01.439
 literals in an example here pdf 2 x ap2 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.140
 y f2 w are not united reliable because 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.950
 I will not be able to make a solution that 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.720
 will allow me to have to and f2 w ego 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.319
 after the substitution I can not between 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.650
 others substitute for the expression 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:19.609
 term f2 w I can only change 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.609
 variables by internal 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.609
 in fact not interested in finding 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.249
 the unifier who is the one who is the 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:32.370
 more general so a more cagole 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:36.299
 general or the acronym of the pg it's going to be 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:39.840
 a unifying head that is such that 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:42.269
 for any other sigma unifier he goes 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.090
 exist exit sorry there will exist a 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.129
 substitution range such as if I 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.129
 dial kid with your tab and I'm going 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:53.639
 get this other cinema substitution 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:55.859
 will see a perfect example sometimes the 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:58.260
 substitution you shut up we saw this 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:00.180
 in fact the pg and so what we show 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.980
 here no it's not a demonstration that 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.560
 it's a pj but just that it's beautiful 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.299
 and a victory is what we have 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.949
 done now now we have another 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:13.219
 substitution 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:15.569
 sigma who will match it will make legal requirement 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:18.180
 and that's really a unifying 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:21.810
 but it's not great for both 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:25.019
 same top2 fdf z p2 so there is 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.889
 actually if I apply six dead ap 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:30.419
 of f2 xyz 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:31.849
 am I going to get that is xv 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:35.099
 is replaced by a 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:37.889
 exit will be replaced by rogers pdf 2 to 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:40.519
 1 then if I go back I forgive I 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:43.139
 remember that the sigma substitution to 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.729
 p2y12 will be replaced by kiev must 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:48.299
 so I will once again gave country 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:50.340
 of f2 has therefore actually applied 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.319
 this substitution but the idea 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.389
 red gets exactly the same thing 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.639
 it allows me a girl on the other hand 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:59.969
 it's not an ivg 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:04:00.419
 but my other substitution also and 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:03.359
 pg 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:07.979
 so actually if I define range 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:08.790
 by committing x equal to messi I combine 

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:13.229
 I compose 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:15.659
 tda with sygma it will give me this here 

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:18.060
 so I let you do the exercise the 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:21.719
 of derivatives this composition the head 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.840
 with gama if I use it as my head 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:23.840
 right here 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.110
 on the other hand for the cinema that I have 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.880
 defined here it's impossible for me to 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.850
 find a kid who will allow me to 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.370
 find some time while sometimes 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:39.220
 I had managed to define a kid who 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:43.030
 do I actually get a 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.860
 substitution which is equal to sygma so 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.620
 for this reason the teta in this 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.440
 example ipg theater but simone is not 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.240
 a draw in fact my price that has 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.630
 held pg it would have to demonstrate that 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.450
 some realities sigma as soon as 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.940
 it's a unifying good it exists 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.080
 always a kid 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.370
 actually we do not offer that kind of 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.810
 problem is what are we going to see if a 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.660
 algorithm that will allow us to 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:10.420
 find a unifier that is the most 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.190
 general in the sentry box that we will see 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.920
 goes to the needs of the notion of a 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.950
 set of disagreement a set of 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:20.770
 disagreements in two liberals it's going to be 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:23.680
 the pair of the first term from 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.100
 the left that differ between the two 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.560
 lateral 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.750
 so we see two examples if we take 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.170
 still the same two top-10 of xyz 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.870
 ears of y to the whole of disagreement in 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.790
 this case it's the set of f2 x and 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.610
 y actually part of the left the 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.360
 are not the first term f2 x here and 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.680
 Greek 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.570
 they are different so that's my 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.110
 whole disagreement because if 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:49.330
 I had as literals pdf of exile 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.150
 despite the peaks to when it's in 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.310
 starting from the left gf2 x which is the 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.590
 same thing as fdx here so it's not 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.890
 my set of second-term disagreement 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:02.380
 z and they are different so the world 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:05.340
 set of disagreement becomes the whole 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.340
 aid and to 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:15.010
 so here is the pseudo code to find 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:16.120
 the most general unifier first 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:20.380
 step what we do is we 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:22.810
 initialize is our substitution 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:26.470
 we're going back we'll start with 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:29.230
 identity substitution so it's so 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:33.240
 the forgiveness man then that's what we 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:36.040
 is that we check if our 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.320
 current substitution so here we did not 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.050
 who will dispute 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:42.960
 so if it's mac and cinema what is it 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.840
 our our current substitution allows 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.940
 to unify the liberals in s 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:50.460
 if so I can return my 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:53.640
 substitution it turns out it lies 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:55.020
 that it's going to be a super g for my 

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.120
 together liberals 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:07:00.270
 on the other hand if it is not the case I must 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:03.120
 calculate persimmons and the set of 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:07.370
 disagreement to militate rohou she 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:10.680
 I applied my current substitution 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:14.210
 afterwards I looked at what 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:17.490
 exists a variable pair term so mtb 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:20.850
 open a variable that belongs to 

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:23.640
 my set of disagreement who is who 

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:26.910
 does not appear in the term so you are 

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:30.150
 I want a variable part open term 

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:33.120
 do not appear in your v belongs my 

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:37.520
 set of disagreement and especially the 

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:40.080
 substitution v equality allows to unify 

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:42.720
 the elements in my set of 

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.580
 disagreement so that allows me to settle 

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.470
 my problem that there are some of 

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:49.860
 terms of a military or who are not 

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:52.080
 equal if I succeed in finding this 

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:54.060
 so bead to find this substitution 

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:57.090
 washes equality well i'm going 

00:07:54.060 --> 00:08:00.840
 incorporate it into substitution 

00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:03.540
 current if my body to the component 

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:06.450
 with the substitution v equality and that that 

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:09.240
 gave me my new substitution for 

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:11.580
 my integration into the sigma as more 

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.020
 healthy and it's going to be the substitution that 

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.650
 I will consider alliterations 

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.840
 next 

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:16.980
 so I'm going back to step 2 where I 

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.260
 am going to check is what my new 

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:21.330
 substitution makes it possible to unify the 

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:23.910
 interros in s if yes I return them 

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:25.620
 otherwise I convinced the years his desire to 

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:29.270
 okay and I do are located up 

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:32.430
 what I managed to unify all 

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:33.990
 fully unify the eroding elite where 

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:35.880
 I did not manage to make a 

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:37.469
 indication so I have not managed to 

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.150
 find a substitution that will me 

00:08:37.469 --> 00:08:41.520
 allow to unify the elements my 

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:44.280
 set of disagreement and in this case there 

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:46.410
 it means that ace europe unified so 

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:48.480
 instead I will return 

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:53.279
 something that lets you know there 

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:54.149
 so maybe a ball to fake you 

00:08:53.279 --> 00:08:55.500
 go lets know that it's 

00:08:54.149 --> 00:09:00.420
 impossible one line is the potting soil 

00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:01.589
 in ace then we will do two examples 

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:04.920
 to help understand 

00:09:01.589 --> 00:09:07.189
 how does the algorithm function test then 

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:11.240
 at the very beginning i start with 

00:09:07.189 --> 00:09:14.459
 empty unification one would be an example 

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:19.170
 montmédy the soil cp2 excipe of xy and 

00:09:14.459 --> 00:09:21.019
 p2y12 could because if xyz and u are 

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:23.149
 variables 

00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:29.339
 oprah iteration i start with 

00:09:23.149 --> 00:09:32.310
 empty unification and I'm checking is this 

00:09:29.339 --> 00:09:35.970
 that it allows to unify but May 2 of 

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:39.360
 it and break ex fds ex y and p2 yz 

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:41.970
 and so if I apply unification the 

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:45.420
 substitution bilge gets exactly the 

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:48.240
 even literal is more than deserved but 

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:51.689
 of the uterus are not equal that's because 

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:53.459
 that it does not allow me to unify them so 

00:09:51.689 --> 00:09:56.370
 the next step is to find 

00:09:53.459 --> 00:10:00.269
 the set of disagreements d1 who 

00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:01.829
 corresponds to my two liberals to whom 

00:10:00.269 --> 00:10:03.569
 I applied my substitution which 

00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:05.639
 substitution quickly so it's the soil 

00:10:03.569 --> 00:10:08.610
 originals and in this case the whole 

00:10:05.639 --> 00:10:11.970
 disagreements correspond to both 

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:13.769
 first terms of melita x and y 

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:18.060
 so my chord set if 

00:10:13.769 --> 00:10:19.709
 the set of xy the game I'm trying to 

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:21.180
 find a substitution that goes to me 

00:10:19.709 --> 00:10:22.800
 allow to unify the elements in 

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:24.689
 my set of disagreement 

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:28.439
 because if it's possible to do a 

00:10:24.689 --> 00:10:31.470
 substitute to experts y so I build 

00:10:28.439 --> 00:10:34.980
 an ex equal substitution y is I'm going 

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:38.160
 update my simoën by the 

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:40.019
 component with excess galls y since 

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:43.889
 otherwise they together empty the composition 

00:10:40.019 --> 00:10:47.129
 indulge x equal is there so that's my 

00:10:43.889 --> 00:10:51.540
 update to my candidate for my 

00:10:47.129 --> 00:10:55.439
 most general indicator operations 

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:58.529
 following so sigma 2 and galas x there 

00:10:55.439 --> 00:11:00.660
 ya all is that these guys there 

00:10:58.529 --> 00:11:03.449
 does that mean it may be 0.6 

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:08.399
 I apply sigma 2 ap 2 except xy 

00:11:03.449 --> 00:11:09.389
 I get p2y12 y / y the judge loaded x by 

00:11:08.399 --> 00:11:12.120
 there 

00:11:09.389 --> 00:11:15.029
 like Saturday in the substitution if I 

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:16.920
 called it cap and y or z pu if 

00:11:15.029 --> 00:11:21.569
 I apply sigma 2 p2 are sure 

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:23.610
 since mode 2 sign does not change there by 

00:11:21.569 --> 00:11:28.319
 anything i still get p2y12 

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:29.910
 is it's not equal to p2y12 yy 

00:11:28.319 --> 00:11:32.309
 so I calculate my set of 

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:34.319
 disagreement of the two 

00:11:32.309 --> 00:11:37.170
 because here too we have the same thing 

00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:38.040
 so we go to the second term f2 y is 

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:40.019
 equal to z 

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:44.420
 so my whole disagreement is 

00:11:40.019 --> 00:11:46.559
 the set and this is the set f2 y and z 

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:48.300
 I was watching what exists 

00:11:46.559 --> 00:11:49.800
 a substitution that allows me to unify 

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:53.730
 my elements from my set of 

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:56.459
 disagree yes I could change there by 

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:59.279
 zdf forgiveness of y 

00:11:56.459 --> 00:12:03.990
 it would allow me to have f2 y and z 

00:11:59.279 --> 00:12:06.089
 substitute by greeks so y so I 

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:08.009
 can update my substitution 

00:12:06.089 --> 00:12:11.910
 ciném'aude hours the component with my 

00:12:08.009 --> 00:12:15.870
 new substitution pardon z is equal 

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:21.949
 f2 is there if I do that I get and that 

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:21.949
 it is equal to y and z is equal to f2 y 

00:12:23.209 --> 00:12:30.360
 third iteration I went with 

00:12:26.089 --> 00:12:35.399
 sygma 3 which is these guys yz equals f 

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:39.149
 is what it means but 2 0 sigma 

00:12:35.399 --> 00:12:43.100
 three stakes ap fdf xy 

00:12:39.149 --> 00:12:45.480
 do not talk about x 2 xy it gives 

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:47.759
 p2y12 yy 

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:51.059
 if I then apply my substitution 

00:12:47.759 --> 00:12:58.319
 cinema 3 ap of said there men's sam 

00:12:51.059 --> 00:13:01.050
 p2 yfz450r is substituted by f2i there is 

00:12:58.319 --> 00:13:03.179
 have not changed but I have not yet 

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:04.889
 equality between the two is my whole 

00:13:03.179 --> 00:13:06.600
 disagreement in this case it's not at 

00:13:04.889 --> 00:13:08.160
 level of the first term is not at 

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.490
 level of the second land leveled 

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:14.529
 third time 

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:15.970
 we are there now I was watching what 

00:13:14.529 --> 00:13:17.140
 it's possible to make a substitution 

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:18.910
 which will allow me to unify my 

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:21.190
 elements in my set of disagreement 

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:24.310
 yes I could take the variable y there 

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:27.790
 was able to kill by the variable y is dense 

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:29.620
 that if we update cinéma3 by my 

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:32.290
 new solution has had 

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:34.209
 and if you calculate the substitution this 

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:37.420
 that you're going to get it's the solution 

00:13:34.209 --> 00:13:40.270
 x also had damage came there 

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:42.610
 also had his new week so 

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:43.450
 substitution after my third 

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:50.290
 iteration 

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:52.930
 cinema4 fourth iteration I watch 

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:55.120
 does my substitution allow me 

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:58.089
 to unify but the potting soil if I apply 

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.839
 sigma that to type 2 x 2 xy I get 

00:13:58.089 --> 00:14:03.220
 country of hu 

00:13:58.839 --> 00:14:06.160
 f2 had enough of that if i apply 

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:08.459
 sigma than typing greek judge 

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:11.410
 once again gets p2 uef from eu 

00:14:08.459 --> 00:14:14.770
 so actually synhorcat is a 

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:16.839
 indicator for my two side and he 

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:20.829
 will find my guarantee pace that 

00:14:16.839 --> 00:14:22.480
 it's also the upg for for a world 

00:14:20.829 --> 00:14:24.370
 together is so that's what I'm going 

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:27.810
 return like a cage and the algorithm 

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:27.810
 will stop 

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:36.300
 let's keep second example with both 

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:38.770
 lateral pdf yx ep 2 xy 

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:42.430
 I start again the first 

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:44.110
 iteration with empty substitution and 

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:45.579
 I looked at what it unifies but the 

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:47.200
 potting of course that leaves a girl 

00:14:45.579 --> 00:14:49.870
 not since they are different my 

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:54.100
 set of disagreement your hebdo is there 

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:55.570
 x now is what exists a 

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:57.160
 solution that unifies 

00:14:55.570 --> 00:15:00.610
 d1 breeders 

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:04.630
 oh yes I could charge experts fbi y 

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:06.130
 so is I dial cigna 1 with my 

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:08.589
 new substitution which gives me 

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:11.760
 since it's christmas together empty etc 

00:15:08.589 --> 00:15:11.760
 segal f2 y 

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:18.510
 second iteration I was watching what 

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:26.130
 six modules unify but predicts 

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:29.820
 than yx 2 x usb 2 xy sorry if I the 

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:30.900
 pay that a sigma 2 api of f2 yx chopin 

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:34.650
 pdf of y 

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:38.670
 f2i greek if i called it capped 2 xy 

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:42.420
 i get p2f 2 yy are they there 

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:44.310
 equals no here actually men 

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:50.730
 are equal but here I have my set of 

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:52.170
 disagreement f2 is there you put in ace 

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:54.750
 which exists a substitution that me 

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:59.070
 Unify the elements of six years 

00:15:54.750 --> 00:16:01.800
 aboard a meter d 2 1 no since I 

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:03.210
 can not be affected y af of the greek it's 

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.830
 what should I do if I wanted 

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:07.560
 that these two things here are equal 

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:10.260
 however, it is an assumption that 

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:12.930
 can aline because the variable to 

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:14.670
 left appears in the right term 

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:17.100
 and that's something that is 

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:18.180
 illegal we can not do that in our 

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:21.270
 substitution is for good 

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:23.310
 valid finish of a substitution and to 

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:25.440
 because of that so we are not able to 

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:26.670
 do the unification of the elements in 

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:29.400
 all the disagreements and so we 

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:31.890
 returns must we return a signal that 

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:36.270
 says we can not do it 

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:39.050
 pg because actually our coastlines are 

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:39.050
 not united reliable
