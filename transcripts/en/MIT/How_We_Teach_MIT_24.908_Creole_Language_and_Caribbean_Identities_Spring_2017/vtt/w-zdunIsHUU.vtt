SPEAKER: The advice I would give
to educators who are teaching

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.140
this course would be to first,
the class had a very technical

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.190
component in terms of the
readings-- maybe not--

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.804
it had a very--

00:00:18.804 --> 00:00:20.220
one of the components
of the class

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.420
was very focused on having
readings that really opened up

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.489
the discussions.

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:26.530
A lot of these were taken
from different sources,

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.010
different-- some from
theoretical linguistics,

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.390
to just general readings from
things like James Baldwin,

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.560
or open op-eds from newspapers.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.840
I think having a strong--

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.060
I think having a lot
of reading material

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.690
that can strike from
different places

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.662
but that also is
very good or that

00:00:46.662 --> 00:00:48.120
gives to a lot of
thinking, I think

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.910
that's something that really
was one of the best things I

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.210
like about this course.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.530
The second was-- is
how this course is also

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.280
a place for dialogue
to examine ourselves.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.890
Since we all speak
a language, we all

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.600
have a sense of identity.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.180
So thinking about all
these things with--

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.320
from our point of view or from
our lives is very important.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.830
So being able to have
a space of discussion,

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.270
a space in which people
can tell their own stories,

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.180
probably for most-- a
good part of the class,

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.840
I think that's one of the
essential parts to making this

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.450
a truly learning experience
that helps you read the word--

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.182
and read the world
and not just the word.
