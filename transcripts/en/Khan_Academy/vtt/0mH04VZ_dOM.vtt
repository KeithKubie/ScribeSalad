00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.110
We are on problem 18.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.200
They give us an equation.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:20.520
h of t is equal to c minus d
minus 4t, all of that squared.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.480
At time equals 0, a ball was
thrown up from an initial

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.880
height of 6 feet.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.280
Until the ball hit the ground,
its height in feet after t

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.130
seconds was given by the
function h above.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.820
And c and d are positive
constants.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.990
So they're telling us at
time 0 we're already

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.020
at height 6, right?

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:44.060
So h of 0, time 0, the
height is already 6.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.290
If the ball reaches its maximum
height of 106 feet at

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:57.330
time 2.5, so h of 2.5 is equal
to 106, what is the height in

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.280
feet of the ball at
time t equals 1?

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.970
So we want to figure
out h of 1.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.629
That's what they want to know.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.850
So in order to figure out h of
1, we essentially have to

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.220
figure out what c and d are
going to be, right?

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.100
So how can we do that?

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.570
Well, we know what h of 0
is, so let's substitute.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.350
So h of 0 gives us this.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.680
Let's put t equals 0 here.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:30.240
You get c minus d minus
4 times 0 squared.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.100
And that is equal to 6.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.880
And then if we simplify this,
this is, of course, 0, right?

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:45.360
So you get c minus d squared
is equal to 6.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.470
Now the second equation, h
of 2.5 is equal to 106.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:57.180
So that means that c minus d
minus-- what's 4 times 2.5?

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.300
4 times 2.5 is 10, right?

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.750
I put 2.5 in for t.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.040
I just did that to save some
space. d minus 10 squared is

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.130
equal to 106.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.310
And now if we want to multiply
this out just to see where

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.910
this takes us, because actually
I don't know where it

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.680
will, you get c minus-- I'll
put it in brackets because

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.040
it's going to be a long
expression-- multiplying this

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.840
out, you get d squared
minus 20d plus 100.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.710
All that equals 106.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.370
And then video. distribute the
negative signs, you get c

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.050
squared-- sorry, this isn't a
square, I don't know where I

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.300
got the squared from.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.170
See what happens when
you take the SAT?

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.670
c minus d squared plus 20d minus
100-- I just distributed

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.500
the negative sign--
is equal to 106.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.680
And then, let's see, we could
add 100 to both sides.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:01.790
You get c minus d squared plus
20d is equal to 206.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.540
I just added 100
to both sides.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.500
So we're left with
two equations.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.780
We're left with this: c minus
d squared is equal to 6.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.710
And then we're left with this:
c minus d squared plus 20d d

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.225
is equal to 206.

00:03:14.225 --> 00:03:16.410
And something should be
jumping out at you.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.280
There's a c minus d squared
in both terms. c minus

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.650
d squared is 4.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.420
Oh no, sorry, c minus d squared
is 6, the previous

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.460
equation tells us.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.960
So we can substitute
6 right here.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:33.110
So if you put 6 there, you got
6 plus 20d is equal to 206.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.240
Subtract 6 from both sides.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.100
20d is equal to 200.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.780
d is equal to 10.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.910
Now if we substitute d equals
10 back in to c minus d

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.370
squared, what do we have?

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.950
d is equal to 10, right?

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:55.730
So c minus 100 is equal to
6, or c is equal to 106.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.290
And if you have an intuition
for how parabolas look, you

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.660
probably could've not guessed,
you probably

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:01.320
would have known that.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.620
You would have known that c is
actually going to be the peak

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.930
point of this parabola.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.850
And they tell us that the peak
point is at point 106.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.240
And then you could've solved
for d from there.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.340
But if you didn't have that
intuition, you could've just

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.350
chugged through the algebra
like we just did.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.360
So we know c, we know d, so we
know the function is now h of

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:32.300
t is equal to 106, minus 10,
minus 4t, all of that squared.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.250
And so we want to know what
happens when t equals 1, so h

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:46.190
of 1 is equal to 106, minus
10 minus 4 squared.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:54.280
So that equals 106 minus 6
squared equals 106 minus 36,

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.620
which is equal to 70.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.690
And we are done.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.970
h of 1 is equal to 70, which
took us a little time, but it

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.200
was worth it.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.990
I'll see you in the next
