00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.340
- [Instructor] As we have
talked about in many videos,

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.969
the United States Supreme
Court has a very different role

00:00:06.969 --> 00:00:11.969
than the executive or
the legislative branches.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.210
The executive branch of
course runs the government.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.930
The legislative branch, they make the laws

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:18.980
and set the budgets.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.580
And then the Supreme Court can rule

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.520
that a law is unconstitutional,

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.470
or it can interpret
laws in a specific case.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.810
And when the Supreme Court
justices make these decisions,

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.860
they try to follow the
principle of stare decisis,

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.530
which is Latin for "let
the decision stand."

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.890
It's this idea of taking
previous decisions as an example.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.740
And if we're in a similar case now,

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.070
then they just use that decision
as an example for this one.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.580
This is closely associated
with the idea of precedent.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.320
Precedent in everyday language means

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.090
something that has happened before,

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.420
an action or a decision
that we can use a guide

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.090
or as an example.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.960
And that's exactly what the
Supreme Court tries to do.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.020
If the Supreme Court has
made a previous ruling

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.050
on a similar case, that would
be considered a precedent

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.070
for this case.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.940
The Supreme Court has been
often described as umpires,

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.810
like umpires in a baseball game.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.503
Even Chief Justice John
Roberts described it as such

00:01:21.503 --> 00:01:24.220
during his confirmation hearings.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.520
And it's this idea that
they should be these

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.100
objective arbiters of what the truth is,

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.400
of what is constitutional and what is not.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.720
What does a law actually mean?

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.660
But we know in reality,
these are human beings.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.330
And no matter how unbiased
and no matter how objective

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.160
they try to be, they
still bring to the table

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.790
their views and their experiences.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.874
And so even though this seems
like a very clean process,

00:01:48.874 --> 00:01:53.290
there's definitely a large
degree of subjectivity here.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.020
And because the executive branch,

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.480
in particular the president,

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.070
can appoint Supreme Court justices,

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.552
there's definitely examples in history

00:02:01.552 --> 00:02:05.280
of changes in politics
having long-term effects

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.410
on changes in the Supreme Court.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.092
For example, a significant
case of overturning precedent

00:02:12.092 --> 00:02:15.733
happens from 1896 to 1954.

00:02:15.733 --> 00:02:19.140
In 1896, you have the
Plessy v. Ferguson case

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.560
that we covered in several other videos,

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.670
where the then Supreme Court

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.640
rules its laws that involve
segregation are okay.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.060
But then you fast-forward almost 60 years,

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.660
and then the Supreme Court then,

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.590
in Brown v. Board of Education
in Topeka, ruled that no,

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.400
separate but equal is not constitutional,

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.820
that segregation is not okay.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.965
And this was influenced by
this idea of, over time,

00:02:44.965 --> 00:02:47.408
you had presidents who were able to

00:02:47.408 --> 00:02:50.862
make judicial appointments
to the Supreme Court

00:02:50.862 --> 00:02:53.956
as members of the Supreme
Court died or retired,

00:02:53.956 --> 00:02:57.437
and went through a Senate
confirmation process,

00:02:57.437 --> 00:03:02.270
and then these justices have life tenure.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.150
They can stay on the Supreme
Court until they pass away

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.370
or until they decide to retire.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.800
And so many historians would
say that this overturning

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.660
of precedent was due
to a change in politics

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.110
from the 1930s through the early 1950s.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.690
When you have several terms of FDR

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.770
and then you have President Truman,

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.030
who appointed justices
to the Supreme Court

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.860
that would eventually rule on
Brown v. Board of Education,

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.286
and they would be more pro-civil rights.

00:03:32.286 --> 00:03:34.340
And what's interesting about this is

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.290
even though presidents
try to appoints folks

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.530
who they believe would maybe
vote the way they would

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.440
or have similar views, many times,

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.005
it doesn't always work that way.

00:03:45.005 --> 00:03:48.330
For example, President
Eisenhower, who was a Republican,

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.010
appointed Justice Earl Warren,

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.040
who was a Republican
governor of California,

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.590
but Warren ended up being famous

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.490
for taking more liberal stances than not,

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.813
including on Brown v. Board of Education.
