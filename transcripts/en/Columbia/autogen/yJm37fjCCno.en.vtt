that crosses the continent of these days
one reason for this choice is the

00:25:24.029 --> 00:25:24.039
one reason for this choice is the
 

00:25:24.039 --> 00:25:27.619
one reason for this choice is the
relevance that memories of colonialism

00:25:27.619 --> 00:25:27.629
relevance that memories of colonialism
 

00:25:27.629 --> 00:25:32.779
relevance that memories of colonialism
have today in the post-colonial Europe

00:25:32.779 --> 00:25:32.789
have today in the post-colonial Europe
 

00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:35.489

very often with an insufficient

country Italy by post-colonial I mean a

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:43.570
country Italy by post-colonial I mean a
 

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:46.830
country Italy by post-colonial I mean a
type of glance type of gaze which takes

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:46.840
type of glance type of gaze which takes
 

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:51.869
type of glance type of gaze which takes
into account that the colonialism has

00:25:51.869 --> 00:25:51.879
into account that the colonialism has
 

00:25:51.879 --> 00:25:54.810
into account that the colonialism has
existed and has to a certain extent

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:54.820
existed and has to a certain extent
 

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:56.279

00:25:56.289 --> 00:25:59.129
inside the globe
and therefore is the premise to

00:25:59.129 --> 00:25:59.139
and therefore is the premise to
 

00:25:59.139 --> 00:26:01.470
and therefore is the premise to
globalization it's a form of

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:01.480
globalization it's a form of
 

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.090
globalization it's a form of
globalization so global and

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:03.100
globalization so global and
 

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:06.779
globalization so global and

00:26:06.779 --> 00:26:06.789
post-colonial blends are linked strictly
 

00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:08.890
post-colonial blends are linked strictly
to God

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:08.900
to God
 

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:12.890
to God
another reason for this switch of

another reason for this switch of
 

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:15.830
another reason for this switch of
attention from the internal to the

attention from the internal to the
 

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:21.470

it a screen memory that has contributed
 

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:37.010
it a screen memory that has contributed
to silence the experience of some other

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:37.020
to silence the experience of some other

therefore I want to go I think that any

therefore I want to go I think that any
 

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:58.850
therefore I want to go I think that any

the term migrants so it says I use the

the term migrants so it says I use the

term migrants as a shortcut but I know
it's not a very good choice but it is

it's not a very good choice but it is

they could be combined with cultural
