00:00:06.826 --> 00:00:08.014
It's a hot day,

00:00:08.014 --> 00:00:10.366
and you've just downed 
several glasses of water,

00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:12.286
one after the other.

00:00:12.286 --> 00:00:16.182
Behind the sudden urge that follows
are two bean-shaped organs

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:19.715
that work as fine-tuned internal sensors.

00:00:19.715 --> 00:00:22.095
They balance the amount of fluid
in your body,

00:00:22.095 --> 00:00:24.112
detect waste in your blood,

00:00:24.112 --> 00:00:26.766
and know when to release 
the vitamins, minerals,

00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:29.447
and hormones you need to stay alive.

00:00:29.447 --> 00:00:31.637
Say hello to your kidneys.

00:00:31.637 --> 00:00:35.941
The main role of these organs
is to dispose of waste products

00:00:35.941 --> 00:00:38.672
and to turn them into urine.

00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:41.565
The body's eight liters of blood
pass through the kidneys

00:00:41.565 --> 00:00:44.877
between 20 and 25 times each day,

00:00:44.877 --> 00:00:51.849
meaning that, together, these organs filter
about 180 liters every 24 hours.

00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:54.675
The ingredients in your blood
are constantly changing

00:00:54.675 --> 00:00:56.825
as you ingest food and drink,

00:00:56.825 --> 00:01:00.480
which explains why 
the kidneys need to be on permanent duty.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.465
Blood enters each kidney through arteries
that branch and branch,

00:01:04.465 --> 00:01:09.609
until they form tiny vessels that entwine
with special internal modules,

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:11.478
called nephrons.

00:01:11.478 --> 00:01:12.795
In each kidney,

00:01:12.795 --> 00:01:17.534
1 million of these nephrons form 
a powerful array of filters and sensors

00:01:17.534 --> 00:01:20.541
that carefully sift through the blood.

00:01:20.541 --> 00:01:22.468
This is where we see just how refined

00:01:22.468 --> 00:01:25.968
and accurate this internal 
sensing system is.

00:01:25.968 --> 00:01:30.980
To filter the blood, each nephron
uses two powerful pieces of equipment:

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:37.601
a blob-like structure called a glomerulus,
and a long, stringy, straw-like tubule.

00:01:37.601 --> 00:01:41.425
The glomerulus works like a sieve,
allowing only certain ingredients,

00:01:41.425 --> 00:01:45.248
such as vitamins and minerals,
to pass into the tubule.

00:01:45.248 --> 00:01:47.439
Then, this vessel's job is to detect

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.361
whether any of those ingredients 
are needed in the body.

00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:54.858
If so, they're reabsorbed in amounts
that the body needs,

00:01:54.858 --> 00:01:57.778
so they can circulate in the blood again.

00:01:57.778 --> 00:02:00.448
But the blood doesn't only 
carry useful ingredients.

00:02:00.448 --> 00:02:02.955
It contains waste products, too.

00:02:02.955 --> 00:02:05.782
And the nephrons have to figure out 
what to do with them.

00:02:05.782 --> 00:02:09.118
The tubules sense compounds 
the body doesn't need,

00:02:09.118 --> 00:02:12.460
like urea, left over from 
the breakdown of proteins,

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.518
and redirects them as urine 
out of the kidneys

00:02:15.518 --> 00:02:19.118
and through two long sewers
called ureters.

00:02:19.118 --> 00:02:23.322
The tubes empty their contents
into the bladder to be discharged,

00:02:23.322 --> 00:02:26.536
ridding your body of that waste
once and for all.

00:02:26.536 --> 00:02:28.851
There's water in that urine, too.

00:02:28.851 --> 00:02:31.701
If the kidney detects too much of it
in your blood,

00:02:31.701 --> 00:02:34.984
for instance, when you've chugged
several glasses at once,

00:02:34.984 --> 00:02:38.970
it sends the extra liquid
to the bladder to be removed.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.508
On the other hand,
low water levels in the blood

00:02:41.508 --> 00:02:44.687
prompt the kidney to release some
back into the blood stream,

00:02:44.687 --> 00:02:48.280
meaning that less water 
makes it into the urine.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.042
This is why urine appears yellower
when you're less hydrated.

00:02:52.042 --> 00:02:56.482
By controlling water, your kidneys
stabilize the body's fluid levels.

00:02:56.482 --> 00:03:00.947
But this fine balancing act
isn't the kidney's only skill.

00:03:00.947 --> 00:03:03.966
These organs have the power 
to activate vitamin D

00:03:03.966 --> 00:03:08.566
to secrete a hormone called renin
that raises blood pressure,

00:03:08.566 --> 00:03:11.259
and another hormone 
called erythropoietin,

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:14.667
which increases red blood cell production.

00:03:14.667 --> 00:03:19.353
Without the kidneys, our bodily fluids 
would spiral out of control.

00:03:19.353 --> 00:03:24.240
Every time we ate, our blood would receive
another load of unsifted ingredients.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.736
Soon, the buildup of waste would overload
our systems and we'd expire.

00:03:29.736 --> 00:03:32.955
So each kidney not only 
keeps things running smoothly.

00:03:32.955 --> 00:03:34.975
It also keeps us alive.

00:03:34.975 --> 00:03:38.639
Lucky then that we have two 
of these magical beans.
