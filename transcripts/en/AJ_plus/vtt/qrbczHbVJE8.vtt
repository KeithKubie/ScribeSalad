00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.280
In February 2018, Ayesha Khatun got a letter she wasn't expecting.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.920
It was a message from her son Jahat,

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.520
written inside a jail in Myanmar's Rakhine state.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.040
She also received a short note from her elderly husband.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.880
It was the first time Ayesha had heard from her 25-year-old son and husband,

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.160
since they were arrested by a Myanmar army sweep in August 2017.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.790
The wave of violence had forced more than 700,000 Rohingya, including 50-year-old Ayesha

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.800
and her remaining nine children, to flee across the border to neighboring Bangladesh.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.960
After that, Ayesha had no news from her husband and son – until the letter arrived.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:35.160
During the weeks of violence, soldiers murdered, raped, and arrested thousands of Rohingya,

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.680
which the United Nations said military leaders
must face genocide charges for.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.680
Myanmar denies the allegations.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.510
With entire villages razed, Red Cross workers
have said many stuck in Myanmar are desperate

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.220
to know if their families made it to the safety
of the camps in Bangladesh.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.880
And like Ayesha, thousands unable to go back are keen to know

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.120
if their loved ones survived.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:05.760
These scraps of paper, carried across borders,
offer a rare source of hope for families.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:12.360
Between August 2017 and October 2018, the
International Committee of the Red Cross

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:19.080
collected more than 2,400 messages and tracing
requests from people on both sides of the

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.040
Myanmar-Bangladesh border.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.040
Red Cross workers have made seven prison visits
in Rakhine to monitor treatment and conditions

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.050
of those detained.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.880
Yet all communication in and out of jails
are censored by Myanmar, and that means letters

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.760
are limited to family news –

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.640
the notes written down by Red Cross workers
in English and Burmese.
