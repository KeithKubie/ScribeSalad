00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.470
Few people in any field of human endeavor
rise to become the unquestioned “top-dog”

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.870
in their profession in their generation, let
alone of all time.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.750
But ask almost anyone who the greatest illusionist
/ escape artist in history was and take the

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.110
proverbial “dollars to doughnuts” wager
that they’ll say “Houdini”.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.910
The Houdini legend persists, and indeed, seems
to grow even larger with each passing decade.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.550
But we’re not here to talk about Houdini’s
life.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.640
Rather, we’re going to discuss the truth
about how he died.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.050
Thanks to the hugely popular (and largely
fictional) 1953 film Houdini, starring Tony

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.140
Curtis, a common myth you’ll often hear
concerning how Houdini died is that he drowned

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.240
failing to escape from a water tank during
a performance, having to ultimately be pulled

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.620
from the tank as depicted in the film.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.280
The real story of how Houdini died is very
different.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.920
When Harry Houdini and his entourage arrived
at The Garrick Theatre in Detroit, Michigan

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.399
on October 24, 1926, the Hungarian-born magician
and escape artist was running a fever of about

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:17.439
102-104 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:22.159
Two days before this, Houdini had been resting
in his dressing room prior to a show in Montreal

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.200
when a college student named J. Gordon Whitehead
approached him.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.549
It’s difficult to determine exactly what
happened from here as accounts from eye witnesses

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:32.020
are slightly conflicting.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.590
However, the general story seems to be that
Whitehead asked Houdini if the claim that

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.170
he could withstand any punch to the abdomen
had any truth to it.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.250
Houdini assured him it was true and gave him
permission to see for himself.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.479
Whitehead immediately took a few jabs at Houdini’s
mid-section while the magician was still reclining

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.250
(he had recently broken his ankle in his famous
Water-Torture Cell escape) and supposedly

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.909
didn’t have a chance to prepare for the
blows from the over exuberant Whitehead.

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.240
The punches inflicted more pain than Houdini
anticipated, and after a few fists to the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.689
gut, he motioned for Whitehead to stop.

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.929
Despite the extreme physical pain that continued
even after Whitehead ceased punching him,

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.310
not to mention his broken ankle, Houdini insisted
the evening’s scheduled performance must

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.830
go on as planned.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.080
By the time Houdini was heading for his next
show in Detroit, his condition had deteriorated

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.080
badly.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.030
He was running a high fever and, though refusing
to go to the hospital, was nevertheless examined

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.849
by a physician before the show.

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:33.069
The doctor diagnosed Houdini with acute appendicitis
and recommended he head immediately to the

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.650
hospital for surgery.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.319
Houdini refused and took the stage.

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.560
He began the performance with several vanishing
acts, culminating with making a woman disappear

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.420
and conjuring a flowering shrub in her place.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.110
He made it through the first act, but his
conditioned worsened and he was forced to

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.430
have his assistant finish the show.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.200
After the show was over, Houdini headed back
to his hotel to rest up, but his wife, Bess,

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.510
reportedly “threw a tantrum” that he wasn’t
going to the hospital and so a physician was

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.540
called in to examine him yet again.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.040
The conclusion was that Houdini needed immediate
hospitalization and surgery.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.569
Houdini was still not keen on the idea, but
after consulting with his personal physician,

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.980
Dr. William Stone, over the phone, he finally
gave in an agreed to go to Grace Hospital

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.700
in Detroit to have an emergency appendectomy.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.120
Once at the hospital, it was established that
Houdini had peritonitis due to a ruptured

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.120
appendix.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.440
At the time, it was speculated that the aforementioned
blows to his abdomen may have been the cause

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.000
of his appendicitis.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.950
In fact, the conclusion made by the life insurance
company, who then had to pay double indemnity

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.650
because of their findings, was that the punches
to Houdini’s abdomen had ruptured his appendix.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.422
This was a reasonable diagnosis at the time,
but today it’s generally thought that this

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:47.790
likely did not play a direct role in his appendix
rupturing as such cases are exceptionally

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.579
rare and from accounts, it’s thought Houdini
was already suffering from the onset of appendicitis

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.269
at the time of the blows.

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:00.230
That said, it has been speculated that the
pain from Whitehead’s punches may have served

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.120
to mask the true seriousness of the condition,
with Houdini perhaps assuming he was suffering

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.810
non-life threatening pains from the blows.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.499
In the era before antibiotics, the secondary
infection caused by a ruptured appendix was

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:18.190
almost always fatal, so it was critical to
get the appendix out before this happened.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.109
Thus, the theory goes that had Houdini not
been punched, he might have sought medical

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.140
attention sooner.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.370
However, this seems doubtful given that even
as his condition worsened to life threatening

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.780
levels, he still refused to heed the physicians
who looked him over.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.350
Whatever the case, as alluded to, doctors
performed emergency surgery to remove Houdini’s

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.880
ruptured appendix, but the damage was already
done.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.260
Harry Houdini held on for about a week at
Grace Hospital, but finally succumbed on October

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.200
31, 1926.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.820
He was 52 years old.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.620
Despite the fact that Houdini believed spiritualism
was a load of bunk and went out of his way

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.900
to discredit it every chance he got, before
he died, he promised his wife Bess that if

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.930
he could possibly communicate “from the
other side,” he would do so on the 10th

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.620
anniversary of his death.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.980
At the appointed time, Bess attempted to contact
Houdini during a séance held on Halloween,

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.220
1936, but to no avail.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.600
Pretty much ever since, various purveyors
of the paranormal have attempted to do the

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:20.250
same on Halloween, but with just as little
luck.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.870
Beyond magic, Houdini was a moderately successful
movie actor (he appeared in several silent

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.440
shorts) and was also a highly successful airplane
pilot back when that was a much bigger deal

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.440
than it is today.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.200
For instance, Houdini made the first successful,
sustained, powered flight in the continent

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.980
of Australia.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:44.090
Harry Houdini was born in Budapest, Hungary
on March 24, 1874 as Erik Weisz.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.860
The Weisz family emigrated to the U.S. in
1878, changed their last name to Weiss and

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.900
Erik’s first name to Ehrich and settled
in Appleton, Wisconsin, where Ehrich’s father

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.590
worked for a time as a rabbi.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.960
Young Ehrich, known also as Ehrie (eventually
morphed into Harry), and his family moved

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.600
to Milwaukee, Wisconsin after his father lost
his position at the Appleton synagogue.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:53.020
Harry left school after the third grade and
ran away from home by age 12.
