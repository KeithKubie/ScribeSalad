This week we're talking
with a self-proclaimed

00:00:02.735 --> 00:00:05.872
normal American millennial who
grew up in America all his life,

00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:07.206
Johnny Young.

00:00:07.239 --> 00:00:09.642
Thank you for being here,
Johnny Young.

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:11.611
(cheering, applause)

00:00:16.982 --> 00:00:18.684
Oh, thanks, Chris.

00:00:18.717 --> 00:00:21.888
I love texts,
I love Netflix,

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:25.024
and chill, dawg.

00:00:25.057 --> 00:00:28.528
Spelled D-A-W-G, the young way.

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:30.730
HARDWICK:
Okay, great.

00:00:30.763 --> 00:00:34.067
Uh, well, that-that kills any
su-suspicions I might have had.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.235
Uh, Johnny,
what do you think about

00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:38.604
Russia's alleged interference
in our election?

00:00:38.637 --> 00:00:41.007
Hey, chill out, man.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.743
Russia has nothing to do
with it.

00:00:43.776 --> 00:00:46.913
(laughs)

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:50.416
Bazinga!

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.385
Uh...

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.057
First of all, please don't ever
say that again, and they don't?

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.394
No, no, Chris, you've been
smoking too much

00:01:01.427 --> 00:01:05.331
of that sticky icky, which I...

00:01:05.364 --> 00:01:08.835
which I, as an American
millennial, also enjoy to smoke

00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:12.205
and relax with my young friends.

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:13.372
(laughter)

00:01:13.405 --> 00:01:15.174
Oh... oh, that's awful.

00:01:15.207 --> 00:01:17.410
That's bad.

00:01:17.443 --> 00:01:19.379
(applause)

00:01:21.013 --> 00:01:24.284
Please... Ple...

00:01:26.752 --> 00:01:29.589
Thank you for ceasing your dab.

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:31.324
According to Fortune magazine,
though,

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:33.025
Russian hackers are believed
to be responsible

00:01:33.058 --> 00:01:35.027
for obtaining 19,000
private e-mails

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.729
from the Democratic party.

00:01:36.762 --> 00:01:40.233
You're still using e-mail,
old man?

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:43.202
The new cool thing is Snapchat.

00:01:43.235 --> 00:01:45.638
You can send secret messages
to every one

00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:47.206
of your millennium friends

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:49.308
who have infiltrated every level

00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:51.043
of American government,

00:01:51.076 --> 00:01:54.947
and the messages automatically
self-destruct.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.818
Plus, there are filters to make
you look like a bunny.

00:01:58.851 --> 00:02:00.353
(laughs)

00:02:00.386 --> 00:02:02.322
(laughs)

00:02:05.324 --> 00:02:07.593
What a country!

00:02:07.626 --> 00:02:10.563
-(cheering, applause)
-All right. All right.

00:02:13.866 --> 00:02:16.135
I'm not trying to be a dick,
but you sound like

00:02:16.168 --> 00:02:18.204
an older Eastern European man
and you look like

00:02:18.237 --> 00:02:20.173
you run a pager store.

00:02:23.842 --> 00:02:26.245
No.

00:02:26.278 --> 00:02:28.781
I'm from New Jersey.

00:02:28.814 --> 00:02:31.017
It's my hipster beard
confusing you.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.418
I don't know.

00:02:32.451 --> 00:02:34.420
Jack, can we pull up this guy's
credentials, please?

00:02:34.453 --> 00:02:36.389
I'm not sure
Johnny's the real deal.

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:39.158
What are you doing
on your phone?

00:02:39.191 --> 00:02:41.827
-Ah, ah, ah.
-Oh, come on.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.630
Ah, ah, ah.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.366
Ah, ah, ah.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.304
Technical difficulties.

00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:54.407
Epic fail.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.875
Harambe.

00:02:55.908 --> 00:02:58.545
All right, that has
nothing to do with anything.

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.285
Why are you calling out
a deceased gorilla name

00:03:06.318 --> 00:03:08.788
and hacking my show
at the same time?

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:10.856
I think this guy
might be kind of dangerous.

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:14.493
HARDWICK:
Uh, yeah, I don't know, I-I...

00:03:14.526 --> 00:03:16.362
(audience exclaims)

00:03:16.395 --> 00:03:18.064
Wait, come on,
what happened to my points?

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:19.498
-HARDWICK: What did you do?
-They're gone!

00:03:19.531 --> 00:03:20.700
-What did you do?
-Hey...

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:23.169
they're Vladimir Putin's
points now.

00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:25.905
HARDWICK:
No, that's it. That is it.

00:03:25.938 --> 00:03:27.406
You know something?

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:29.141
You stop that clapping.

00:03:29.174 --> 00:03:31.310
You know, you can (bleep) with
the presidential election, fine,

00:03:31.343 --> 00:03:33.212
but don't you dare
(bleep) with the integrity

00:03:33.245 --> 00:03:36.582
of the game portion of
<i> @midnight,</i> you son of a bitch.

00:03:36.615 --> 00:03:38.484
Get out of here,
you Russian spy!

00:03:38.517 --> 00:03:40.186
-A Russian spy, everyone.
-No.

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:42.155
-No, no.
-(cheering, applause)

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.659
HARDWICK:
Stop dabbing.

00:03:46.692 --> 00:03:48.425
Don't let him dab anymore.
