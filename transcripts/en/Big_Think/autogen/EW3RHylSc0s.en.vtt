read tone or body language in emails so

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189
read tone or body language in emails so
 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.700
read tone or body language in emails so

in two minutes and actually build a

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500
in two minutes and actually build a
 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.039
in two minutes and actually build a
relationship because if you think of

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049
relationship because if you think of
 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.990
relationship because if you think of
culture is just kind of the sum total of

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000
culture is just kind of the sum total of
 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.780

the relationships that that colleagues

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790
the relationships that that colleagues
 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.120
the relationships that that colleagues
have with each other the thing about

email is that it does literally nothing
to build those relationships and is more

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840
to build those relationships and is more
 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.960
to build those relationships and is more
likely to actually damage whatever

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970
likely to actually damage whatever

forth that can chew up a day so quickly
so again a phone call Skype just walking

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140
so again a phone call Skype just walking
 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.870
so again a phone call Skype just walking
down the hall can be so much more

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880
down the hall can be so much more
 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.670
down the hall can be so much more
effective and will actually build those

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680
effective and will actually build those
 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.380
