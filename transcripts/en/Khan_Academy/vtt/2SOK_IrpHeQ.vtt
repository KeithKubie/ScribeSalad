00:00:00.212 --> 00:00:02.268
We have an interesting looking
diagram here.

00:00:02.268 --> 00:00:04.745
Let's see if we know a few things
about this diagram.

00:00:04.745 --> 00:00:11.195
Let's say we know that line MK

00:00:14.861 --> 00:00:19.781
is parallel to line NJ.

00:00:19.781 --> 00:00:23.399
So this line is parallel to this line.

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:25.863
This is line MK, this is line NJ.

00:00:25.863 --> 00:00:28.070
Now, given that
and all the other information

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.231
on this diagram,

00:00:29.231 --> 00:00:36.041
I'm hoping to prove that the measure
of this angle LMK

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:43.105
is equal to the measure
of this angle over here

00:00:43.105 --> 00:00:49.005
and this angle is LNJ.

00:00:53.045 --> 00:00:56.102
Another way of writing this is;

00:00:56.102 --> 00:01:01.722
the measure of LMK is b
and the measure of LNK is a.

00:01:01.722 --> 00:01:04.422
So we want to prove that b is equal to a

00:01:04.422 --> 00:01:06.793
using all this information
that we know.

00:01:06.793 --> 00:01:09.764
Like always I encourage you
to try this on your own

00:01:09.764 --> 00:01:12.102
before I walk through it.

00:01:12.102 --> 00:01:14.087
Alright, let's walk through it.

00:01:14.087 --> 00:01:20.547
The first thing you might see is
I have a triangle formed up here,

00:01:23.501 --> 00:01:25.865
triangle MLK.

00:01:25.865 --> 00:01:31.315
What do we know about the measurement
of the interior angles of a triangle?

00:01:31.315 --> 00:01:33.685
The measures of the interior angles
of a triangle

00:01:33.685 --> 00:01:37.301
are going to add up to 180 degrees.

00:01:37.301 --> 00:01:41.821
We know that b,
which is the measure of this angle

00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:47.081
plus the measure of this angle, c

00:01:47.097 --> 00:01:51.867
plus the measure of this right angle,
which is plus 90 degrees

00:01:57.011 --> 00:02:03.021
is going to be equal to 180 degrees.

00:02:08.291 --> 00:02:11.852
And so if we subtract 90 degrees
from both sides

00:02:11.852 --> 00:02:16.902
we're going to get b plus c
is equal to 180 degrees minus 90 degrees.

00:02:25.423 --> 00:02:30.011
It's going to be 90 degrees.

00:02:30.011 --> 00:02:32.635
Or if we wanted to solve
explicitly for b

00:02:32.635 --> 00:02:34.873
we could subtract c from both sides,

00:02:34.873 --> 00:02:41.993
and we could write b is equal to
90 degrees minus c.

00:02:49.015 --> 00:02:53.277
So that's interesting,
that's one way of expressing b.

00:02:53.277 --> 00:02:55.504
Can we express a in a similar way?

00:02:55.504 --> 00:02:57.584
Once again, if at any point
you get inspired

00:02:57.591 --> 00:02:59.015
I encourage you to do that.

00:02:59.015 --> 00:03:05.855
If we look carefully we see that
we have triangle NLJ,

00:03:12.934 --> 00:03:17.446
this really big triangle,
it's really most of the diagram.

00:03:17.446 --> 00:03:23.466
What's interesting about NLJ
is that J is another right triangle,

00:03:23.476 --> 00:03:27.059
c is one of the measures
of one of the interior angles,

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:29.356
and a is a measure of
the other interior angle.

00:03:29.356 --> 00:03:31.081
We can write something very similar,

00:03:31.081 --> 00:03:37.011
we can write a plus c
plus 90 degrees

00:03:45.344 --> 00:03:52.014
is going to be equal
to 180 degrees.

00:03:59.463 --> 00:04:01.398
So what can we do here?

00:04:01.398 --> 00:04:05.007
We can do the exact same process
to solve for a.

00:04:05.007 --> 00:04:08.631
If we subtract 90 from both sides
and we subtract c from both sides

00:04:08.631 --> 00:04:11.719
what do we get?

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:18.299
We get a is equal to 90 degrees
and if you subtract c from both sides

00:04:20.725 --> 00:04:24.754
you're going to get 90 degrees minus c.

00:04:24.754 --> 00:04:26.906
Now this is interesting,

00:04:26.906 --> 00:04:30.566
b is equal to 90 degrees minus c
and a is equal to 90 degrees minus c.

00:04:30.566 --> 00:04:34.611
So 90 degrees minus c is equal to a,
it's also equal to b.

00:04:34.611 --> 00:04:41.321
Or, we can now say that
a must be equal to b,

00:04:41.329 --> 00:04:45.000
that the measure of angle LMK
which is b

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.340
is equal to the measure of angle LNJ
which is equal to a.
