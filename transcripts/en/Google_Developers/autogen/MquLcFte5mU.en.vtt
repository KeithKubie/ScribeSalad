experienced with Android development so

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310
experienced with Android development so
 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.400
experienced with Android development so
I guess when you were using the Android

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410
I guess when you were using the Android
 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.229

it is a mobile scenario I believe that
maybe buffering or more buffering or

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410
maybe buffering or more buffering or
 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:14.199
maybe buffering or more buffering or
maybe offline a if you can manage the

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209
maybe offline a if you can manage the
 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.400
maybe offline a if you can manage the
video to play something in in an offline

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410
video to play something in in an offline
 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.030
video to play something in in an offline
scenario it could be great yeah so so

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040
scenario it could be great yeah so so
 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.199
scenario it could be great yeah so so
buffering is something we're always

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209
