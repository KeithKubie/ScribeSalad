You probably know that plenty
of colleges offer classes

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.170
online, but if students need a
little extra help, more and

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.120
more of them are finding it
now for free on YouTube.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.740
Kiet Do shows us what
could be the next

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.770
generation of online learning.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.820
Going to a traditional old
school is, well, old school.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.860
This is the worldwide

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.030
headquarters of the Khan Academy.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.640
Inside this converted walk-in
closet could be

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.120
the future of education.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.560
What we can do here is just
distribute this x plus 2y onto

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.260
each of these terms.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.750
With a headset, an electronic
pen, and a zest for learning,

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.980
Sal Khan records short,
bare-bones, 10-minute

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.220
educational videos and posts
them on YouTube.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.480
No big deal until you realize
there are more

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.910
than 1,500 of them.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.720
So 3 plus 4 is equal to 7.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.950
Covering everything from
basic addition--

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.780
The dimension of a transpose.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.870
--to advanced linear algebra--

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:59.420
And he is the King of Prussia.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.310
--to French history--

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.459
You now have $40,000.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:07.930
--and Ponzi schemes, economics
mixed with current events.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.980
70,000 people view his
bite-sized videos every day at

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.930
their own pace, all for free.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.830
At the end of the day, what
makes this fun for me is the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.980
idea that as many people
as possible could

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:18.770
benefit from it.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.900
Khan started recording videos
back in 2006 to tutor an

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.330
out-of-state relative.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.250
Since then, it's exploded, and
last year, he left his

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.020
lucrative job as a hedge fund
analyst and lives off

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.440
donations to Khan Academy.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.010
The 33-year-old says the videos
can free up teachers to

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.310
focus on teaching instead
of lecturing.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.610
So the teacher says go home,
watch these videos, and then

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.160
when we come to class the next
day, you have already watched

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.480
the lecture.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.610
I don't have to do that
broadcast lecture to you in

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.380
the classroom, and we'll
actually do your homework in

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.210
the classroom.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.685
Accessible, cheap, effective,
and sustainable teaching for a

00:01:50.685 --> 00:01:51.770
wired generation.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.110
It is making people think hard
about, well, what is the

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.730
proper role for technology
in the classroom?

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.790
So I do hope it starts a bit of
a revolution, but I don't

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.680
know if I can call myself
a revolutionary.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.400
Call it education 2.0.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.570
And we are done!

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.770
In Mountainview, Kiet Do.
