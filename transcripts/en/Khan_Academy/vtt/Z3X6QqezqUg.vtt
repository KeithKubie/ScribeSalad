00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.760
As a pot of tea cools, the temperature

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.260
the tea is modeled by a differentiable
function h.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.780
For 0 is less than or equal to, t is less
than or equal to 10.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.600
Where time t is measured in minutes.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.830
And temperature h of t is measured in
degrees Celsius.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.090
Values of h of t, at selected time,
selected values of time

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.380
t are shown in the table above, so that's
right over there.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.420
Use the data in the table to approximate
the rate at which

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.110
the temperature of the t is changing at
time t equals 3.5.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.130
Show the computations that lead to your
answer.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.232
So, they give us a bunch of points, so
let's just graph this,

00:00:38.232 --> 00:00:40.730
just so we can visualize what this data's
telling us a little bit.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.810
And, I suspect that this might be useful,

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.280
so, this, right over here, is our
temperature axis.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.370
This is our temperature at any moment, in
degrees Celsius.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.560
And then, this is our time axis, and they
gave us the time of 0 2 5 9 and 10.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.186
They give us a temperature of those times.

00:01:00.186 --> 00:01:01.590
So, this is 0.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.300
2, 5's A little bit further.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.320
5, 9, And then 10.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.890
And at time zero, the temperature's 66
degrees, Celsius.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.640
66, So it's right over there.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.080
At time 2, it is 60 degrees Celsius.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.330
At time two, it is 60 degrees celsius.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.780
At time 5, it is 52 degrees Celsius.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.610
So time 5, maybe it's right over here,
this is 52 degrees Celsius.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.520
At time 9, or after 9 minutes, I should
say, it's at 44 degrees Celsius.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.050
So this 44 degrees Celsius, and after 10
minutes it's 43 degrees Celsius.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.600
So this is really just a graph showing how
it

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.430
cools off over those ten minutes, over
those ten minutes.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.130
That's what the data is telling us.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.270
It's kind of a curve like this, and we've
sampled it at these points.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.340
So going back to Part A.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.010
Use the data in the table to approximate
the rate at which

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.190
the temperature of the tea is changing at
time t equals 3.5.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.420
So the rate of change is really just a
slope

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.289
of this curve at time t is equal to 3.5.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.450
So really, we just wanna find the slope at
that point right over there.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.610
We wanna find the slope, and we don't know
the actual function.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.220
So the best way to approximate the slope
at that point, is

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.050
really just find the slope, between, time,
between minute five, and minute two.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.840
So the rate of change, so we could say, we
could say that the rate, the

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.160
rate, is going to be approximately, our
change

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.340
in temperature over that, over those three
minutes.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.930
So, h of 5 minus h of 2, and this is
obviously going

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.675
to be in degrees Celsius, over the number
of minutes that changed, so we

00:02:47.675 --> 00:02:51.870
went from 5 minutes or from, we end at 5
minutes, and we started

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:58.090
at 2 minutes, and so the rate, the rate is
going to be approximately.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.990
At five minutes, our temperature is 52
degrees, 52 degrees.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.350
At two minutes, our temperature is 60
degrees, 60 degrees.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.020
And then, this is over change in three
minutes.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.490
5 Minus 2 is 3.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.410
So, this gets us, let me just pull to the
right a little bit,.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.820
This gives us negative 8.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.350
Negative 8 degrees Celsius over three
minutes.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.390
Or the rate at, the rate at, at three and
a half

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.260
minutes is going to be approximately

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.990
negative 8 3rds, degrees Celsius per
minute.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.840
So that is part a, part a.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.132
And then part b, using correct units,
explain the

00:03:39.132 --> 00:03:42.040
meaning of 1 over 10, 1 over 10, times

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.510
the definite integral from 0 to 10 of h of
t dt in the context of this problem.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.400
Use a trapezoidal sum with the 4
sub-intervals

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.090
indicated by the table to estimate this
thing.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.390
So, the integral from 0 to 10 of h of t is

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.050
really the area of this entire, under this
curve, right over here.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.360
That's the integral, that's this part
right over here.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.340
And then, we're going to divide that.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.280
We're going to divide that by.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.780
We're going to divide that by 10.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.950
So, what this is really giving us.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:10.510
This is.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.410
This expression, right over here.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:13.830
Is the average,

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.107
this is the average temperature.

00:04:18.107 --> 00:04:20.410
This is the average temperature over that
time period.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.340
The integral of the temperature function
divided by the

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.390
total amount of time that has, that has
elapsed.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.900
And then, in using correct units, well
it's the average temperature

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.000
and the average temperature is once again
going to be in degrees.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.820
Degrees Celsius.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.340
And it makes sense, cuz this right over
here is in degrees Celsius.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.330
You're multiplying it by time right over
here, but then you could divide by.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.850
You're dividing, I'm assuming, by time
right over here

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.630
as, so this is times minutes, divided by
minutes.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.180
So then you just get degrees Celsius
again.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.310
So this is, this expression right over
here

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.030
is just the average temperature over those
ten minutes.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.570
They they say use a trapezoidal sum with
the

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.390
four sub intervals indicated by the table
to estimate this.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.440
So, a trapezoidal sum is, we don't know
the

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.050
exact function here, so we won't be able
to

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.790
analytically evaluate this definite
integral, but what we can

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.040
do is divide, is divide this area into
four sections.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.620
They tell us to use this, four
subintervals.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.280
And, we'll essentially divide it into four
trapezoids.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.510
So, this is one trapezoid right over here.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.980
So this is one trapezoid right over there.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.550
That's my first trapezoid from zero to two
on the base.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.220
And you see on the left end of that

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.880
trapezoid is height of 66 the right end is
60.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.680
And the the next trapezoid will go from
two to five.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.160
Let me do that in a more.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.300
Color that contrast a little bit better.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.270
The next trapezoid will go from 2 to 5.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.880
The next trapezoid goes from 2 to 5.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.160
And then the third trapezoid goes from,

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:54.662
goes from 5 to 9.

00:05:54.662 --> 00:05:55.423
The third trapezoid goes from 5 to 9.

00:05:55.423 --> 00:05:58.480
And then, the fourth trapezoid goes from 9
to 10.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.850
Goes from 9 to 10.

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.320
And so if I want to.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.268
If I want to approximate the definite
integral part right here, before we

00:06:05.268 --> 00:06:08.790
divide by 10, I just need to find the area
of these four trapezoids.

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.980
So, let's do that.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.450
The area of this first trapezoid is going
to

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:17.950
be the base, which is 2 times the average
height.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.710
The height if the left side for this
trapped is 66.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.920
The height on the right side of this
trapezoid is 60.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.250
The average height right over here is
going to

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.280
be 63, just the average of 60 and 66.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.770
So, this area right over here is, this is
126,

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:37.210
that's the area of the green part right
over there.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.970
By the same logic, the area of this orange
part.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.530
I want to do that in the orange color.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:48.250
The area of this orange part, the base
right over here is 3.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.000
Base is 3.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.520
And then the average height.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.890
The height over here is 60.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.060
The height over here is 52.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.790
This is, they're seated 8 apart, so the
average is going

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.010
to be 4 away from each is going to be 56.

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:04.800
So this is, the area here is going to be 3
times, 3 times 56.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.540
Which is 150 plus 18.

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:11.740
150 Plus 18 is 168.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:18.110
That's the area of this orange trapezoid,
and then the area of this blue trapezoid.

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:20.640
The base right over here is 4, and then

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.397
then average height, the height here is
52, the height

00:07:24.397 --> 00:07:27.464
here is 44, the average of 52 and 44, let

00:07:27.464 --> 00:07:31.240
see they're 10, they are, sorry, they are
8 apart.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.020
So then it's just gonna be 4 from each of
these so it's 48, so

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:40.200
the average height here is 48, and so 4
times 48 is 160 plus 32.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:47.690
So it's 192, and then finally this last
trapezoid, it's base is only 1.

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:50.720
Its base right over here is only 1, and
then its

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:56.820
height is 43 at the left side, 43 at the
right side.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:00.303
So its average height is 43.5, 43.5.

00:08:00.303 --> 00:08:03.200
So it's 43.5 times 1.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:09.600
So that's just going to be 43.5, and so if
we add up the areas under,

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.150
or the areas of all these trapezoids, we

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.710
have a pretty good approximation for the
definite integral.

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:14.590
I'll just use, do the.

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:16.748
Use the calculator for this part right
over here.

00:08:16.748 --> 00:08:25.951
So we have 126, plus 168, plus 192, plus
43.5, 43.5.

00:08:25.951 --> 00:08:27.630
Gives us 529.5.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:31.470
So this is equal to 529.5.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:34.740
And so that's our

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:40.000
approximation for the definite integral
part.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.090
But then we also have to divide it by 10,
or we have to multiply time 1 10th.

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:47.630
So we've evaluated, so this part right

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:51.780
over here, we got 529.5 as our
approximation.

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.030
It's not going to be exact, but using the,
using

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.980
the trapezoidal sum, the sum of the areas
of these trapezoids.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:00.975
And now we have to multiply by 1 10th, so
lets do that.

00:09:00.975 --> 00:09:03.606
So, or we could just divide by 10, which

00:09:03.606 --> 00:09:07.417
actually we don't need a calculator for
that, 52.95.

00:09:07.417 --> 00:09:11.615
So this whole thing, this whole thing
evaluates to 52.95,

00:09:11.615 --> 00:09:14.760
and I'll do the next two parts in the next
video.
