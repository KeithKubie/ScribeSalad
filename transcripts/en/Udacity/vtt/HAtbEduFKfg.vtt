00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We have two tension forces, so each has to be half as big.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
A force of 500 N twice will balance the 1000 N force.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now that's pretty amazing, of course, there is a caveat.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
If I'm going to lift this 1 m high,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
it turns out I'm actually going to have to pull down over a distance of 2 m.

00:00:19.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Check out the link below this video to understand why this is the case.
