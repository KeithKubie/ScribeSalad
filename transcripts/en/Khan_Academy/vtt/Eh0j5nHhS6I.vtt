00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:07.440
Problem number 18.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.610
The average arithmetic
mean of x and y is k.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.140
So the average, so x plus
y/2 is k, right?

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.000
That's the average of x
and y is equal to k.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.200
Which of the following is the
average of x, y and z?

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.400
So they want to know what x plus
y-- so the average of x,

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.115
y, and z is, you add up
all the numbers and

00:00:29.115 --> 00:00:31.550
you divide by 3.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.640
They want to know in
terms of k and z.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.240
So if we could substitute for
x plus y, then we'd be done.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.580
So multiplying this equation by
2, we get x plus y is equal

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.750
to 2k, right?

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.950
Just multiply both sides by 2.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.660
And then x plus y is 2k.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.610
So let's just substitute
2k here for x plus y.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.410
So then you just get
2k plus z/3.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:06.230
That's the average of x, y
and z: 2k plus z/3, and

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.480
that is choice A.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:17.870
Problem 19.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.070
We have a neat drawing here.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.386
Let me see if I can draw this.

00:01:23.386 --> 00:01:31.000
Let's see, we have a circle,
and then we have a triangle

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.440
inside of that.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.070
Well it's not really inside of
it, it kind of does something

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.980
like-- let's see, the triangle
goes like that.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:44.800
And the other line kind of
goes-- Oh, oh, close enough.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.410
Close enough.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.725
I think you get the point.

00:01:46.725 --> 00:01:49.260
It actually kind of touches
at the bottom there.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.930
This should be touching
at the bottom.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.800
And then we have-- oh, we
have another line that

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.940
goes down like this.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.340
All right.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.590
OK.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:10.580
This is O, Y, X, W, Z.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.460
This is W.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.480
We can do a better
color on W, OK?

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.860
That's O, V, all right.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.350
In the figure above, triangle
X, Y, Z is equilateral--

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.130
that's good to know-- with
side of length 2.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.490
So this side is 2, this
side is 2, and this

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.710
whole side is 2.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.500
If w, y is the diameter of the
circle with center O-- so w,

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.360
y, this is the diameter of the
circle with center O-- then

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.570
the area of the circle
is-- fascinating.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.610
So essentially, we just need to
figure out what the height

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.810
of this line is, because if we
know the length of this, we

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:49.520
can figure out the area.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.290
Because that's the diameter,
we'd know the radius, and we'd

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.270
use pi r squared.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.090
So how do we figure that out?

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.210
Well, this is an equilateral
triangle, and so that means

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:00.500
all of the angles
are 60 degrees.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.200
So that's 60, this
is 60 degrees.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.450
And now this whole angle up here
is going to be 60, but we

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.710
split it exactly
in two, right?

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.100
So this angle is going to be 30
degrees and this angle is

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.770
30 degrees.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.840
And if you don't believe me,
how else do we know that?

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.450
Well they tell us that this
is a right angle, right?

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.610
This is a right angle, this
is a 90 degree angle.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.640
So that's how we know this was
actually split in two, because

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.040
this is 90, this is 60, and they
have to add up to 180.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.410
So this angle up here is 30.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.430
So I think you are going to see
now that this is a classic

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.710
30, 60, 90 triangle, right?

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.470
If this side up here is 2, then
we know that the side

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.100
opposite the 30 degree side
is 1/2 the hypotenuse.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.030
This side is the hypotenuse
right here.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.980
The corresponding side to the
30 degree side, or the

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.580
opposite to the 30 degree side,
is 1/2 the hypotenuse.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.100
So this is 2, this is 1.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.120
And that also makes sense,
because this is a symmetric

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.110
triangle, and this w is the
midpoint, because it's

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.070
perpendicular and these
angles the same.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.110
So this would also be 1.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.650
So 1, and 1, and 2,
1 plus 1 is 2.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:11.870
So that makes sense as well.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.850
And then we know-- and if you
forget this, they actually

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.730
give you the formula at the
beginning of every SAT exam--

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.610
that the side opposite the 60
degree side-- which is the

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.040
side we're trying to figure
out-- that square root of 3

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.650
times this side-- so square root
of 3 times this is what?

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.630
Well it's square root of
3 times 1, which is

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.940
square root of 3.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.610
And if you don't believe this,
you could try the Pythagorean

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:37.190
theorem, right?

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.980
Square root of 3 squared plus 1
squared is equal to-- well 3

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.330
plus 1, which is equal to 4,
which is equal to 2 squared.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.390
Which is equal to hypotenuse
squared.

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.005
So we figured out this diameter
right here is

00:04:51.005 --> 00:04:51.660
square root of 3.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.320
The whole thing is
square root of 3.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.425
If the whole thing is square
root of 3, what is the radius?

00:04:57.425 --> 00:04:59.990
The radius is going
to be 1/2 of that.

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.540
The radius is 1/2 of that,
so the radius is

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.030
square root of 3/2.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.025
And now we're ready to
figure out the area.

00:05:07.025 --> 00:05:08.540
Area is equal to pi r squared.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.730
And they give you this
formula too at the

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:10.970
beginning of the SAT.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.820
So area is equal
to pi times the

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.495
square root of 3/2 squared.

00:05:16.495 --> 00:05:19.790
And that equals pi times square
root of 3 squared is

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.830
3/-- and then 2 squared
is 4, so 3/4 pi.

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.620
And 3/4 pi is choice C.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.190
Image, clear image, invert
colors, all right.

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.270
Problem 20.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.950
We're already at the end
of this section.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:45.170
Problem 20, when 15 is divided
by the positive integer k, the

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:46.130
remainder 3.

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:54.020
So 15 divided by k has
a remainder of 3.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.270
I'm lazy.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.180
For how many different values
of k is this true?

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:07.650
So when 15 is divided by k,
you have a remainder of 3.

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:08.900
Interesting, OK.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:20.590
Actually the easiest thing to do
is say well, 15 divided by

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:25.800
k is going to be, essentially--
Well the easiest

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.660
way-- I'm just trying to think
of whether we should just do

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:28.500
it by brute force.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.730
We can actually just do it by
brute force, because it says k

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:33.950
is a positive integer, right?

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.460
So what values of k work?

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.230
Well does k equal 1 work?

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.520
When 15 is divided by 1,
there's no remainder.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.030
So k 1 does not work.

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.000
k equals 2?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.720
Actually, let's just do
it. k remainder 1, 2,

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.500
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, right?

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.930
It's going to go all
the way up to 15.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.000
You know, we could
keep trying.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.260
So when 1, the remainder is 0.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:03.090
2 goes into 15 7 times with
a remainder of 1.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.240
3 goes into 15 with
a remainder of 0.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:11.690
4 goes into 15 with a remainder
of 3, right?

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:16.600
Because 4 gets to 12, and then
you have a remainder of 3.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.750
5 has a remainder of 0.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:22.535
6, once again, 6 gets to
12, and then it has a

00:07:22.535 --> 00:07:25.550
remainder of 3.

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.070
So 6 works.

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:30.260
So 4 and 6 work.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:35.210
7 has a remainder of 1, right?

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.030
7, 14 remainder of 1.

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:44.290
And then if you just did 8,
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 8 has a

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:45.780
remainder of 7.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.580
9 has a remainder of 6.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:48.760
10 has a remainder of 5.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:52.590
11 has a remainder
of 4, right?

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:54.580
15 divided by 11 is
1, remainder of 4.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:58.870
12 has a remainder of
3, so 12 works.

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:00.190
13 has a remainder of 2.

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:01.400
14 has a remainder of 1.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.370
And then 15 has no
remainder again.

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:09.570
So the numbers that work
for k are 12, 6, and 4.

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:16.730
So it was essentially the
factors of-- well all right, I

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:17.960
can't actually say that.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.960
Well, we just did it by brute
force and those are the 3 k's

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.520
that work for this problem.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.620
So the answer is choice C.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.800
I'm trying to think if there's
a faster, elegant

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.410
way of doing this.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:32.309
But this actually didn't
take too much time.

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:34.390
But anyway, that's all
for this section.

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:37.700
I'll see you in the
next SAT section.
