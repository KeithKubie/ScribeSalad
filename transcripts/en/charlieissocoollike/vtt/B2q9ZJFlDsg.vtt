00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.240
VO: This episode of Fun Science is brought to
you by Brilliant.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.680
These are the lyrics to the theme song of
this very show.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.040
CHARLIE: But despite the fact that I've been making
fun science videos for years,

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.420
and that I've written an entire Fun Science book, available in all good book stores,

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.620
I have never, ever, tried to explore
the actual science of fun!

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.220
But today that changes, in this episode of...

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.280
[FUN SCIENCE THEME SONG]

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.320
So, what is fun?

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.600
Well, surprisingly, science 
finds fun hard to define.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.860
Although we know that fun brings enjoyment,
not all enjoyment brings fun.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.820
VO: For example, though I quite
enjoy listening to classical music,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.540
I wouldn't really describe the experience as fun.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.520
Although, someone else's experience might
be different.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.140
CHARLIE: However, although fun is subjective,
we all experience it in the same way

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.920
when the chemical dopamine is released in our brains.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.320
Now, dopamine evolved as a reward for behavior
that benefitted our survival.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.080
So if you do something good for your species,
like reproducing, your brain releases dopamine

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.480
as if to say, great job, do more of that.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.520
But science also shows us that it is possible
to have too much of a good thing.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.500
VO: Take gambling as an example.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.780
It might feel fun to win at first, but when
we repeatedly flood our brain with dopamine

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.360
in high dosages it can actually change the
structure of our brain, and thus our behavior.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.160
This is what can form the makings of an addiction,
which definitely is not fun.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.960
CHARLIE: But, provided that it's not excessive, fun
can definitely be good for you.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.880
VO: It can help with depression, for example.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.120
Studies show that doing something fun with
others, even if you don't initially feel like it

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.900
can still improve your mood dramatically.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.480
CHARLIE: And fun can help us to be more creative.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:03.670
In a study where 1,500 people were asked to
list potential uses for a jam jar and a paperclip,

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.560
those who ranked themselves as most playful
were also able to come up with more ideas,

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.560
like this one.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.760
It's a paper clip container.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.280
Pretty fun, right?

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.480
VO: Here's a 'fun' fact.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.000
If you can convince your brain that you're
going on a run for fun rather than as exercise...

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.880
CHARLIE: I'm having a great time!

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.780
VO: Then you'll actually be less likely to eat
afterwords.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.560
CHARLIE: My run was my reward!

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.940
And, while making time for fun is important,
apparently we have more fun when leisure activities

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.280
are loosely scheduled, say within a set window
of time, or better yet completely unplanned--

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.800
ANGELINA: Hey Charlie!

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:46.800
CHARLIE: What?

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.180
I'm kind of busy right now.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.100
ANGELINA: Do you wanna have a
backpack fashion parade?

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.240
CHARLIE: DO I!?

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.740
VO: And although it is still fun to have fun all
by yourself,

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.600
we tend to have more fun when we do things with others, especially if they're our friends.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.660
And what's a common side effect of having
fun together?

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.180
[LAUGHING]

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.560
VO: Laughter.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.940
Scientists believe that laughter is related
to the panting sound that animals like chimps

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.480
and bonobos make when the engage in rough
and tumble play.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.420
It's as if the laughter is there to signal...

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.360
CHARLIE: We're just playing and having fun.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.240
ANGELINA: We're not gonna kill each other.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.520
VO: And this signaling is helpful because play
can help us to learn things like social rules,

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.320
establishing rank, bonding, motor skills,
and managing stress.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.460
CHARLIE: And maybe that's the best thing about fun,

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.580
and possibly the reason that
Fun Science exists in the first place,

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.320
because fun makes it easier
for us to learn...

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.900
So I hope you had fun, and I hope you learnt
something,

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.060
and if you're looking to learn more science with
the help of fun, why not try Brilliant?

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.650
VO: The people who built Brilliant understand
the important role that fun plays in learning.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.080
They give you fun and challenging problems
to solve, getting you hooked on learning actively,

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.700
and helping you to master complex concepts.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.620
Brilliant have loads of science courses to
explore, but why not start with their science

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.040
essentials course and refamiliarize yourself
with the basics?

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.590
To learn more go to brilliant.org/FunScience
and sign up for free, although the first 200

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.960
