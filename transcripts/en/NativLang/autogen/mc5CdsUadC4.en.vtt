put it anywhere just yet now take temp
 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.610
put it anywhere just yet now take temp
and stick it where var1 is then peel off

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620
and stick it where var1 is then peel off
 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.399
and stick it where var1 is then peel off
var1 and stick it over there with var2

and you can now take var 2 and put it

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260
and you can now take var 2 and put it
 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.770
and you can now take var 2 and put it
back where tempus after this whole run
