00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.860
You've seen the good version in
Wreck-It Ralph.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.780
You skipped the Will Ferrell version in
Megamind.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.280
Now, get ready for the most OK version
of the animated villain becomes a hero story in:

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.220
Despicable Me 1 and 2!

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:25.900
Meet Gru,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.900
a terrorist who's just likeable enough
to keep the audience on his side.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:30.540
"(coin clangs)"

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.440
He's got severe depression.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.940
A plan that will kill everyone on Earth,

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.360
"Stealing the Moon?!"

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.840
and a really funny voice so
you won't dwell to hard on those things.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.180
"You will not cry,
or laugh, or giggle!"

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.220
"(giggles)"

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.820
Enter a world where villains and spy's lurk
just below the surface.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.120
Or rather ride on top of the surface
where everyone can see.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.440
Where the evil plots are straight
out of Carmen Sandiego.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.380
"The Great Pyramid of Giza
had been stolen!"

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.100
"and replaced by
a giant inflatable replica."

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.300
But the bad guys draw
the line at robbery?

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.460
"I really don't see how
we can afford this."

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.860
"I'll just get another one
from the bank."

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.160
And the police straight up
don't exist,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.520
which is too bad,
because Gru kills a lot of people.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.540
"(screams)"

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.340
"(screaming)"

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.840
"(clang)"

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.900
"(tire screech)"

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.860
"(ray firing)"

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.220
"(whirring)"

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.300
"(kids cheering)"

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.660
"(rumbling)"

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.560
"I've got it!

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.140
I've got the moon!!!" 
(Alarm blazing)

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.100
In Despicable Me,

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.520
ride along as Gru adopts three little girls
with three old grandma names.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.440
"Margo, Edith and Agnes"

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.560
In the short but sweet kids' movie
with heart and humour.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.180
"(grunts and groans)"

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.280
Then watch Despicable Me 2,

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.940
a 90-minute rehash of the first one
with war of what kids really want.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.720
Minion fart jokes.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.040
"(fart sound, chuckles)"

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.940
"(gibberish, fart sound)"

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.280
Haha, get it?

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.940
The Minion did the fart noise.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.540
See Pixar? This is exactly
what was missing from Up.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.300
(fart)

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.600
Witness the tragedy of a man slowly losing
his franchise to his underlings.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.100
As the minions go from cute little
interludes between scenes.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.040
To having their own B-story.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.860
To getting a spin-off movie that's bigger
than Despicable Me's ever were.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.560
To becoming the unofficial mascot
of your crazy aunt's Facebook page.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.580
What do the minions have
to do with vaccines?

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.620
What is wrong with you Aunt Pam?

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.760
So kick back and enjoy the franchise
you love to hate.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.660
Not because the movies are bad,

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.340
but because you can't get away
from the ad campaigns.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.860
The crappy spin-offs.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.860
Or that Pharrell song
you liked at first.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.140
Until it burrowed into your brain
like a molly soaked tapeworm.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.340
Damn it, it's back in my head again!

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.660
Hey, you stole that nacho hat
from The Simpsons!

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.660
You don't own everything yellow
and bald, you know!

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.880
Hey, Screen Junkies,
if you even more Despicable Me,

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.880

and the cast of the movie, some real Despicable Memes,

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.740
