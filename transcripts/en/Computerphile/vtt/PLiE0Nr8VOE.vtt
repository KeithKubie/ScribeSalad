00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.120
Up until now...

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.800
An awful lot of information security  mechanisms

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.260
and the policy debate has been about the use of

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.340
security to protect the privacy of personal data and the confidentiality of business data

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.340
But in the future once we get software and communications in everything, it's going to be much more about safety

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.740
And this is going to change the policy debate as well

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:28.820
Because at present many people might not object too much to the idea that the FBI has a golden master key that

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.110
That lets them break into your iPhone and read all your embarrassing private chat messages

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:41.300
But I think people will be very much more nervous about the idea that the FBI will have a golden master key

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.420
that will enable them to break into your car remotely

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.160
and turn it into a weapon that could kill you

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.800
And if this golden Master key is available also to other intelligence and police agencies around the world

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:00.280
Then perhaps that begins to become a real problem, and we have to revisit the whole question of government

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.500
special access to cryptographic keys and the systems in General

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:15.540
So far, people have talked about the possible privacy risks of the internet of things and we saw the Cayla doll being banned in Germany

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.720
Because it's basically a remotely commandable room bug

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.520
and we also saw the Mirai Botnet last year

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.100
where some bad person recruited a couple of hundred thousand TV cameras to DDoS

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.660
a DnS service which took Twitter offline for a few hours in the US Eastern seaboard

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.559
But I think that the big problem with the internet of things isn't going to be privacy

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:47.149
Or availability, it's going to be safety what we are now doing is putting online an awful lot of devices

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:51.949
On which people depend for their lives, and which can kill people if they go wrong

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.740
the obvious cases are cars and medical devices, but there are many more

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.760
And the other thing that's going to make this complex and difficult is the fact that up until now

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.329
We've known how to make two kinds of dependable system

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:14.419
The first is a system like a mobile phone, where are you upgrade it every month to make sure that all the security

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:21.319
Flaws are patched but where you're expected to throw it away after two or three years and nobody bothers to patch really old

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.949
versions of your phone software or your laptop software and the other type of thing that we build is

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.940
stuff like cars and medical devices and

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.040
electricity substations

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:41.030
And other durable things that we expect to last for 30 or 40 years. Now, in the case of cars, what we do is

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.829
We test the software to death before the thing goes on sale, and we hope that's going to be good enough

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:50.539
And we never upgrade it afterwards unless there's some real panic. Now

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.989
This is going to change because tesla is already shipping monthly software upgrades for their cars

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:58.980
Ford and BMW

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.160
Have already shipped some upgrades and everybody will be doing this within three or four years. All of a sudden

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.120
Your car becomes something like your phone or your laptop

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.340
Which gets a monthly software upgrade.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:18.830
And this is great for some purposes and terrible for other purposes. It's great because it means that if there's some safety vulnerability

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.349
like for example when a

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.519
Tesla driver was killed when his car went into the back of a truck which was painted white because the sky was was gray and

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.480
It wasn't visible enough

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.289
Something like that you can fix by shipping a software upgrade

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.719
and it will be very very much cheaper than having to Recall millions of cars and

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.229
Reflashing all the firmware at a cost of billions and billions and billions

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.518
but although it brings us the possibility of

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.548
steady growth in vehicle safety

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:51.939
It brings a terrible cost with it

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:59.230
Which is that we've got to maintain the capability to patch that software not just for years

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.129
but for decades

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:05.858
And we don't know how to do that either in organizational terms or in technical terms

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.040
So let me state the problem

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.920
Suppose you're working in Cambridge, England or in Cambridge, Massachusetts

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.960
on some software that will, say, help do navigation

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:28.720
In a land rover, or a jeep, or a phone or whatever that you expect to go on sale in 2020

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.780
How are you going to be able to patch that software

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.980
In 2030?

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.600
In 2040?

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.040
There are small numbers of systems that have been maintained for a long time

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.860
for example Deep-space probes

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.600
Another example is avionics software

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.080
where, basically,

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.280
Stuff may be replaced or may get a midlife upgrade

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.280
But where regular updates aren't expected

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:06.120
Because the kind of devices that you have in an airport, in an airport's air traffic control system, or in an aircraft cockpit

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.710
Tend not to be connected directly to the internet and so you don't have the same attack surface

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.310
you don't suddenly have the need to patch stuff because of

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.940
Shell Shock or something like that which could actually

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.899
Render it open to attack, but in the future

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.269
We're looking at a world in which all our cars are online all the time

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:34.029
Right? Because the car will be autonomous or at least partly autonomous. It will be communicating

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.279
over the Network; it will be downloading maps, it'll be

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.380
downloading traffic information

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:45.890
It will be contributing to traffic information. It will be getting updates of all sorts of kinds of kinds of code and data

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.280
it will be a very very complex beast, and

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.880
How we manage that is going to be a big problem.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.440
Now, at present we have serious problems in getting OEMs to patch

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.569
Systems like Android and so most of the Android phones in the world are insecure

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.150
simply because their vendors

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.390
Can't get it together, or don't have the incentives to patch them

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:13.760
Now this is going to become considerably worse from once we start talking about cars

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.950
Because the car is not just a simple system that's made by one vendor anymore.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.229
The brands that you buy, be it Volkswagen or Mercedes or Peugeot or

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:33.170
General Motors or whatever are basically integrators who buy in components from lots and lots of people who sell the parts, who sell the

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:39.710
The ABS, who sell the automatic emergency braking, who sell in future the robo chauffeur

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.160
Which will actually drive

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.160
You to work while you're sitting there

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:50.329
hacking some code, and so you then got the technical problems and the business problems of how do you produce software upgrades

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:55.039
which marry together code written by potentially dozens of different firms?

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.569
Then there's a question of who's going to be liable for it all when things go wrong

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:03.229
And then there's going to be the question of who pays for it all.

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:06.410
Now, at present

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:09.710
software firms try and get rid of the liability

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.840
for software going wrong

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:17.779
And that's not going to be possible when software is in devices that can kill people. Legislators simply won't allow it.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:19.760
laws in both America

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.539
And Europe see to it that if you sell a device that kills people,

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:29.960
then you're liable and it doesn't matter how often you get your users to click on the "Don't Sue Me" button. That basically doesn't work.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:38.679
For now. We won't talk about exactly what's going to see understand, but the idle hold that [observations] of [a] bottom PP

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:43.180
It's been very difficult yet out all the shuttle enter, but then we fight around making

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:48.399
Difficulties all these done them to see minute [very] [tiny] bringing in [duplication]. That's already having
