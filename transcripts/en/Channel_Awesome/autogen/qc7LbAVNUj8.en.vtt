was what's the best writing in my
 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.340
was what's the best writing in my
opinion and a bus so the acting is

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350
opinion and a bus so the acting is
 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.680

little touches that catch you a little
off-guard like their stuff with

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959
off-guard like their stuff with
 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.670

hypnotism in this that it's done in a
 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.220
hypnotism in this that it's done in a
very unique way again I won't give it

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230
very unique way again I won't give it
 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.350
very unique way again I won't give it
away but the way that's done is very

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360
away but the way that's done is very
 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.620
away but the way that's done is very
effective both visually and in the idea

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630

of it um and I say there's just enough

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989
of it um and I say there's just enough
 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.770

this was and just wait for it all to
 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.410
this was and just wait for it all to
play out but I think sort of the writing

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420
play out but I think sort of the writing
 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.560

nobody really wants to be that but the

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:44.020
nobody really wants to be that but the
 

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.840
nobody really wants to be that but the
ones that are always find a way of

that's not what they're doing um so
again you can kind of see this line up

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:53.890
again you can kind of see this line up
 

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:55.140
again you can kind of see this line up
where it's like they know they're doing

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:55.150
where it's like they know they're doing
 

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:56.940
where it's like they know they're doing
something bad but it's not race as bad

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:56.950
something bad but it's not race as bad
 

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:59.250
something bad but it's not race as bad
except they're cooking it because they

00:07:59.250 --> 00:07:59.260
except they're cooking it because they
 

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.290
except they're cooking it because they
actually really appreciate it they

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:01.300
actually really appreciate it they
 

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.150

away from them and putting our brains
 

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.370
away from them and putting our brains

interesting spin I thought that was a

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:21.220
interesting spin I thought that was a
 

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.880
interesting spin I thought that was a
really really cool and in many respected

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:23.890
really really cool and in many respected
 

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:26.070

really interesting so this does take an
 

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.420
really interesting so this does take an
interesting angle in terms of like a

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:46.430
interesting angle in terms of like a
 

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:49.810
interesting angle in terms of like a
horror film or a psychological thriller

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:49.820
horror film or a psychological thriller
 

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:54.970

you just from the first frame you think
 

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:26.190
you just from the first frame you think
you know where it's going to go so I

you know where it's going to go so I
 

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.250
you know where it's going to go so I
like that but it's not hugely different

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:29.260
like that but it's not hugely different
 

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.620
like that but it's not hugely different
it's not like oh you got me and stuff

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:31.630
it's not like oh you got me and stuff
 

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:32.850
it's not like oh you got me and stuff
it's one of those things where you just

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:32.860
it's one of those things where you just
 

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:37.050
it's one of those things where you just
going to go okay um so so it's not where

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:37.060
going to go okay um so so it's not where
 

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:39.449

I was going to go but there's nothing
that like all of that makes it so much

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:41.860
that like all of that makes it so much
 

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.740
that like all of that makes it so much
more powerful that makes the message or

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:43.750
more powerful that makes the message or
 

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:45.870
more powerful that makes the message or
that makes the TWiT so much more great

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:45.880
that makes the TWiT so much more great
 

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.550
that makes the TWiT so much more great
it's more just kind of playing with an

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:47.560
it's more just kind of playing with an
 

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:48.810
it's more just kind of playing with an
idea that you saw you know where it's

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:48.820
idea that you saw you know where it's
 

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:50.790
idea that you saw you know where it's
going to go you don't but it's not

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:50.800
going to go you don't but it's not
 

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.370
going to go you don't but it's not
really like you don't stand up and go on

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:53.380
really like you don't stand up and go on
 

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:56.790
really like you don't stand up and go on
yeah no you got me that's just totally

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:56.800
yeah no you got me that's just totally
 

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.920
yeah no you got me that's just totally
thrown me for a loop it's just oh you

00:13:58.920 --> 00:13:58.930
thrown me for a loop it's just oh you
 

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:01.620
thrown me for a loop it's just oh you
didn't go that direction nice kind of

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:01.630
didn't go that direction nice kind of
 

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:05.940
didn't go that direction nice kind of
thing um so yeah I think this is a very

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:05.950
thing um so yeah I think this is a very
 

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:10.860
thing um so yeah I think this is a very
good very clever film uh it's not a film

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:10.870
good very clever film uh it's not a film
 

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:13.410
good very clever film uh it's not a film
that necessarily like grabs me it's not

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:13.420
that necessarily like grabs me it's not
 

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:14.730
that necessarily like grabs me it's not
something I'm like I'm guessing it's

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:14.740
something I'm like I'm guessing it's
 

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:17.160
something I'm like I'm guessing it's
like eight nine times or anything like

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:17.170
like eight nine times or anything like
 

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:18.480
like eight nine times or anything like
that even though there are things that

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:18.490
that even though there are things that
 

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:20.610
that even though there are things that
come back a lot of things do end up

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:20.620
come back a lot of things do end up
 

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:22.019
come back a lot of things do end up
coming back you know stuff in the

00:14:22.019 --> 00:14:22.029
coming back you know stuff in the
 

00:14:22.029 --> 00:14:23.699
coming back you know stuff in the
pictures and stuff all that is very

00:14:23.699 --> 00:14:23.709
pictures and stuff all that is very
 

00:14:23.709 --> 00:14:26.970
