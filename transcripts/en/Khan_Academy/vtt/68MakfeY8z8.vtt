00:00:00.468 --> 00:00:01.791
- [Voiceover] Which of
the following represents

00:00:01.791 --> 00:00:04.926
all solutions X comma Y to the system

00:00:04.926 --> 00:00:06.877
of equations shown below?

00:00:06.877 --> 00:00:08.734
This is an interesting
system of equations,

00:00:08.734 --> 00:00:10.545
because this is a linear
equation, this first one,

00:00:10.545 --> 00:00:12.148
but the second one is nonlinear.

00:00:12.148 --> 00:00:15.027
You have a Y squared right over here.

00:00:15.027 --> 00:00:18.462
Well this one actually can
be solved with a substitution

00:00:18.462 --> 00:00:21.946
because two Y plus six
needs to be equal to X,

00:00:21.946 --> 00:00:23.501
but then we also know that X is equal

00:00:23.501 --> 00:00:25.631
to Y squared minus nine.

00:00:25.631 --> 00:00:27.536
So we could take Y squared minus nine

00:00:27.536 --> 00:00:29.973
and substitute it for X.

00:00:29.973 --> 00:00:32.807
So if you do that, you
then can solve for Y,

00:00:32.807 --> 00:00:36.824
the Y of a solution to this system.

00:00:36.824 --> 00:00:41.329
So if two Y plus six is equal to

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.125
Y squared minus nine.

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:46.219
And so, let's see.

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:49.540
Let's just get zeros on
the left-hand side, so

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.792
we could subtract two Y from both sides.

00:00:51.792 --> 00:00:52.650
I'll write that.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:53.975
Subtract two Y there.

00:00:53.975 --> 00:00:56.320
We could subtract six from both sides.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.201
And then on the left-hand side

00:00:58.201 --> 00:01:00.105
we're going to be left with zero.

00:01:00.105 --> 00:01:01.173
And on the right-hand side,

00:01:01.173 --> 00:01:05.152
you're gonna have Y
squared minus 15 minus,

00:01:06.272 --> 00:01:07.410
actually, let me write
it the other way around.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.623
Y squared, I'm gonna write the minus two Y

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.125
minus 15.

00:01:13.967 --> 00:01:17.286
And now to solve for the
Ys that would satisfy

00:01:17.286 --> 00:01:19.911
this quadratic right over here,

00:01:19.911 --> 00:01:21.861
we could factor this quadratic,

00:01:21.861 --> 00:01:24.322
we could factor this quadratic expression.

00:01:24.322 --> 00:01:26.830
And let's see, the way I
would do that is first,

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.336
can I think of two numbers
whose product is negative 15?

00:01:30.336 --> 00:01:33.610
And immediately the
numbers three and five,

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.328
either negative three, positive five,

00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:37.627
or positive three, negative five jump out,

00:01:37.627 --> 00:01:39.926
and whose sum is negative two.

00:01:39.926 --> 00:01:41.644
Well if the sum is negative that means

00:01:41.644 --> 00:01:44.477
that the negative number has to have

00:01:44.477 --> 00:01:45.590
a larger magnitude.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.515
So it's going to be
negative five and three.

00:01:49.515 --> 00:01:52.463
Negative five and three's
product is negative 15,

00:01:52.463 --> 00:01:54.693
their sum is negative two.

00:01:54.693 --> 00:01:56.690
And if what I'm doing right
now looks a little bit

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.616
like voodoo to you, I
encourage you to review

00:01:59.616 --> 00:02:02.959
factoring quadratic
expressions on Khan Academy.

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:04.209
Do a search on Khan Academy

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:06.461
for factoring quadratic expressions.

00:02:06.461 --> 00:02:07.715
But we now know how to factor.

00:02:07.715 --> 00:02:09.618
This is going to be zero is equal to,

00:02:09.618 --> 00:02:11.498
and we can write this as

00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:16.154
Y minus five times Y plus three.

00:02:16.944 --> 00:02:19.104
Well, if you have the
product of two things

00:02:19.104 --> 00:02:20.637
that are equal to zero,

00:02:20.637 --> 00:02:23.260
that means that you could
get this to be equal zero

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.095
by making one or both
of these equal to zero.

00:02:25.095 --> 00:02:26.883
So the solutions are gonna be,

00:02:26.883 --> 00:02:28.693
how do you make this one equal zero?

00:02:28.693 --> 00:02:30.853
Well Y would be equal to five.

00:02:30.853 --> 00:02:32.780
And how do you make
this one equal to zero?

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.124
Well Y would be equal to negative three.

00:02:36.124 --> 00:02:39.223
Either one of these
would make one of these,

00:02:39.223 --> 00:02:40.801
Y equals five would make this zero,

00:02:40.801 --> 00:02:42.334
which would make the
entire expression zero,

00:02:42.334 --> 00:02:43.704
so this is a solution.

00:02:43.704 --> 00:02:46.282
And Y equals negative
three would make this zero,

00:02:46.282 --> 00:02:48.139
which makes this entire expression zero,

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:50.473
so it is also a solution.

00:02:51.221 --> 00:02:54.634
Now we could go back and
try to solve for the Xs,

00:02:54.634 --> 00:02:56.469
or we could immediately
look at our choices

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:58.929
and say well do any of these
choices have Y equal five

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:02.250
and Y equals negative three
as at least the Y coordinates

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.481
of solutions?

00:03:03.481 --> 00:03:07.798
And these first two don't
even have two choices,

00:03:07.798 --> 00:03:09.772
but this one right over here,

00:03:09.772 --> 00:03:12.258
they're actually trying
to trick us a little bit.

00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:14.626
Because we have this number,
five and negative three,

00:03:14.626 --> 00:03:15.555
and it's like hey, maybe this one,

00:03:15.555 --> 00:03:17.761
but this isn't Y equals five.

00:03:17.761 --> 00:03:20.477
This is X equals five.

00:03:20.477 --> 00:03:23.101
And when X equals five, Y
is equal to negative three.

00:03:23.101 --> 00:03:24.934
That's X and that's Y.

00:03:24.934 --> 00:03:27.861
The first coordinate is X,
the second coordinate is Y.

00:03:27.861 --> 00:03:30.694
So Y equals five and Y
equals negative three.

00:03:30.694 --> 00:03:33.457
This one is Y is equal to five

00:03:33.457 --> 00:03:36.406
and Y is equal to negative three.

00:03:36.406 --> 00:03:38.796
So you should feel immediately pretty good

00:03:38.796 --> 00:03:41.072
about this choice right over here.

00:03:41.072 --> 00:03:43.348
This one puts the five
and the negative three

00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:44.556
in for the X coordinate.

00:03:44.556 --> 00:03:46.088
That says X is equal to five

00:03:46.088 --> 00:03:49.362
and X is equal to negative three.

00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:52.009
So, you wouldn't, if I
was under time pressure,

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:53.565
I would just stop there
and I would move on

00:03:53.565 --> 00:03:55.051
to the next question, because I feel good

00:03:55.051 --> 00:03:56.258
about this choice.

00:03:56.258 --> 00:03:57.999
But if you want to go
back and feel good that

00:03:57.999 --> 00:03:59.897
when Y equals five, X equals 16

00:03:59.897 --> 00:04:02.726
and when Y equals negative
three, X is equal to zero,

00:04:02.726 --> 00:04:06.556
you can go back and substitute
into this first equation.

00:04:06.556 --> 00:04:11.056
Because we have two times five

00:04:11.056 --> 00:04:13.424
plus six is equal to X.

00:04:13.424 --> 00:04:16.559
So when Y is equal to
five, you have 10 plus six,

00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:20.970
you have X is equal to 16
when Y is equal to five.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.596
And that's what we saw right over here,

00:04:22.596 --> 00:04:24.430
when Y is five, X is 16.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.893
And when Y is negative three,

00:04:25.893 --> 00:04:30.258
two times negative three
plus six is equal to X.

00:04:30.258 --> 00:04:31.976
This on the left-hand side is going to be

00:04:31.976 --> 00:04:33.532
negative six plus six,

00:04:33.532 --> 00:04:35.157
X is equal to zero.

00:04:35.157 --> 00:04:38.269
So when Y is negative
three, X is equal to zero.

00:04:38.269 --> 00:04:40.567
So, we took a little
extra time to make sure

00:04:40.567 --> 00:04:42.145
that we feel good about
this, but once again

00:04:42.145 --> 00:04:45.498
under time pressure, I
wouldn't have necessarily gone

00:04:45.498 --> 00:04:47.931
through to this extra length.
