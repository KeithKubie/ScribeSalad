perfect way around that because what you

just one person in the office then

kind of two fundamental things now the

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720
kind of two fundamental things now the
 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.899
kind of two fundamental things now the
normal way that you do this of everybody

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909
normal way that you do this of everybody

bowl and picking a name of a hat fails
 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.960
bowl and picking a name of a hat fails
on both of those fronts okay so imagine

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970
on both of those fronts okay so imagine
 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.090
on both of those fronts okay so imagine
you've got everybody who's involved in

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100
you've got everybody who's involved in
 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.530
you've got everybody who's involved in
your Secret Santa sitting around a table

your Secret Santa sitting around a table
 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.600
your Secret Santa sitting around a table
everybody writes their own name onto a

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610
everybody writes their own name onto a
 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.069
everybody writes their own name onto a
piece of paper and drops it into a bowl

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079
piece of paper and drops it into a bowl
 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.780
piece of paper and drops it into a bowl
in the middle and then that bowl is

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790
in the middle and then that bowl is
 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.300
in the middle and then that bowl is
passed around the table and people pick

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310
passed around the table and people pick
 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.950
passed around the table and people pick
out names of who they're gonna buy the

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960
out names of who they're gonna buy the
 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.660
out names of who they're gonna buy the
gift for if they pull out their own name

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670
gift for if they pull out their own name
 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.910
gift for if they pull out their own name
though they read it and replace it back

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920
though they read it and replace it back
 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.380
though they read it and replace it back
in the bowl and then pick another name

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390
in the bowl and then pick another name
 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.170
in the bowl and then pick another name
by doing that you have to sort of

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180
by doing that you have to sort of
 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.270
by doing that you have to sort of
consider the situation where the last

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280
consider the situation where the last
 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.279
consider the situation where the last
person around the table picks out their

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289
person around the table picks out their
 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.970
person around the table picks out their
own name now if they do that

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980
own name now if they do that
 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.350
own name now if they do that
what how do you solve it without

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360
what how do you solve it without
 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.260
what how do you solve it without
violating the rule of anonymity because

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270
violating the rule of anonymity because
 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.510
violating the rule of anonymity because
they can't swap it with anyone else

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520
they can't swap it with anyone else
 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.250
they can't swap it with anyone else
because by doing so they would know

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260
because by doing so they would know
 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.320
because by doing so they would know
exactly who is buying them a present so

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330
exactly who is buying them a present so
 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.330
exactly who is buying them a present so
the only real fair thing to do in that

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340
the only real fair thing to do in that
 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.860
the only real fair thing to do in that
situation is to scrap whole thing start

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870
situation is to scrap whole thing start
 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.060
situation is to scrap whole thing start
all over again there's quite a good

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070
all over again there's quite a good
 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.440
all over again there's quite a good
chance of that happening so if you have

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450
chance of that happening so if you have
 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.180
chance of that happening so if you have
20 people sitting around your table

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190
20 people sitting around your table
 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.120
20 people sitting around your table
there's a 4% chance that the last person

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130
there's a 4% chance that the last person
 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.380
there's a 4% chance that the last person
will pour their own name and you have to

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390
will pour their own name and you have to
 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.670
will pour their own name and you have to
scrap and completely start all over

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680
scrap and completely start all over
 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.710
scrap and completely start all over
again if the second last person pulls

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720
again if the second last person pulls
 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.330
again if the second last person pulls
their name it's a third to last person

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340
their name it's a third to last person
 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.070
their name it's a third to last person
pulls their name you know all sorts of

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080
pulls their name you know all sorts of
 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.850
pulls their name you know all sorts of
anonymity issues can be violated the

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860
anonymity issues can be violated the
 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.430
anonymity issues can be violated the
chance of anybody pulling anybody else's

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440
chance of anybody pulling anybody else's
 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.850
chance of anybody pulling anybody else's
name is not uniform it depends on where

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860
name is not uniform it depends on where
 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.530
name is not uniform it depends on where
you're sitting around that table because

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540
you're sitting around that table because
 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.850
you're sitting around that table because
what you're looking for in this scenario

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860
what you're looking for in this scenario
 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.460
what you're looking for in this scenario
you are looking for something called a

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470
you are looking for something called a
 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.830
you are looking for something called a
derangement so it's a type of

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840
derangement so it's a type of
 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.979
derangement so it's a type of
permutation where nobody ends up with

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989
permutation where nobody ends up with
 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.540
permutation where nobody ends up with
their own name effectively okay so

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550
their own name effectively okay so
 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.860
their own name effectively okay so
imagine you've just got three people

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870
imagine you've just got three people
 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.100
imagine you've just got three people
playing you got a B and C now even

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110
playing you got a B and C now even
 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.650
playing you got a B and C now even
though there are six ways that this can

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660
though there are six ways that this can
 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.040
though there are six ways that this can
be reordered there are only two extra

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050
be reordered there are only two extra
 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.870
be reordered there are only two extra
permutations here that could work for

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880
permutations here that could work for
 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.789
permutations here that could work for
Secret Santa to derangements they're

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799
Secret Santa to derangements they're
 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:20.150
Secret Santa to derangements they're
called

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160
called
 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.440
called
so there are other permutations of

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450
so there are other permutations of
 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.240
so there are other permutations of
course but the problem is with any of

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250
course but the problem is with any of
 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.390
course but the problem is with any of
these three in every case somebody if

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400
these three in every case somebody if
 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.190
these three in every case somebody if
they're sitting around table in a b and

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200
they're sitting around table in a b and
 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.350
they're sitting around table in a b and
c somebody will end up with their own

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360
c somebody will end up with their own
 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.789
c somebody will end up with their own
name so this column here is kind of who

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799
name so this column here is kind of who
 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.740
name so this column here is kind of who
that person is pulling out so if a is

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750
that person is pulling out so if a is
 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.360
that person is pulling out so if a is
the first person on the table they're

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370
the first person on the table they're
 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.590
the first person on the table they're
going to pick their own name in this

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600
going to pick their own name in this
 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.509
going to pick their own name in this
permutation b will pick their own name

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519
permutation b will pick their own name
 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.070
permutation b will pick their own name
in this permutation and c will pick

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080
in this permutation and c will pick
 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.390
in this permutation and c will pick
their own name in that permutation so

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400
their own name in that permutation so
 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.740
their own name in that permutation so
none of those are allowed that none of

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750
none of those are allowed that none of
 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.990
none of those are allowed that none of
those are allowable Secret Santas the

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000
those are allowable Secret Santas the
 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.360
those are allowable Secret Santas the
question is how likely is it that each

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370
question is how likely is it that each
 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.240
question is how likely is it that each
of the people end up buying for a

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250
of the people end up buying for a
 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.190
of the people end up buying for a
particular person and it turns out that

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200
particular person and it turns out that
 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.569
particular person and it turns out that
the order that you're sitting around the

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579
the order that you're sitting around the
 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.390
the order that you're sitting around the
table makes a difference to that APICS

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400
table makes a difference to that APICS
 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.600
table makes a difference to that APICS
first then B goes second and C goes

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610
first then B goes second and C goes
 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.120
first then B goes second and C goes
third so if we think about the bowl of

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130
third so if we think about the bowl of
 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.880
third so if we think about the bowl of
names for a we know that if a picks out

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890
names for a we know that if a picks out
 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.250
names for a we know that if a picks out
their own name who's going to replace it

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260
their own name who's going to replace it
 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.940
their own name who's going to replace it
oh she think I'm gonna place it back in

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950
oh she think I'm gonna place it back in
 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.500
oh she think I'm gonna place it back in
the bowl so really there's only two

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510
the bowl so really there's only two
 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.740
the bowl so really there's only two
things that a can can pick out from that

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750
things that a can can pick out from that
 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.420
things that a can can pick out from that
bowl and the guess Secret Santa carry on

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430
bowl and the guess Secret Santa carry on
 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.219
bowl and the guess Secret Santa carry on
so that's either B or C and then the

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229
so that's either B or C and then the
 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.050
so that's either B or C and then the
probability of 1/2 in each case because

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060
probability of 1/2 in each case because
 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.030
probability of 1/2 in each case because
if they pick a it's a non game exactly

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040
if they pick a it's a non game exactly
 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.060
if they pick a it's a non game exactly
they they read their own name put it

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070
they they read their own name put it
 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.470
they they read their own name put it
back in the bowl and then pick again

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480
back in the bowl and then pick again
 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.400
back in the bowl and then pick again
okay so if a ends up picking out B now

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410
okay so if a ends up picking out B now
 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.260
okay so if a ends up picking out B now
it's B's go so B's already out of the

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270
it's B's go so B's already out of the
 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.050
it's B's go so B's already out of the
pile so there's only two names left and

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060
pile so there's only two names left and
 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.180
pile so there's only two names left and
either one that B can pick is totally

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190
either one that B can pick is totally
 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.159
either one that B can pick is totally
fine we're gonna pick a or C and each of

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169
fine we're gonna pick a or C and each of
 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.310
fine we're gonna pick a or C and each of
those has preventive a half however if a

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320
those has preventive a half however if a
 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.129
those has preventive a half however if a
is pick b and b is picked a there's only

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139
is pick b and b is picked a there's only
 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.500
is pick b and b is picked a there's only
one name left for c to pick from which

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510
one name left for c to pick from which
 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.620
one name left for c to pick from which
is their own name and that my friend is

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630
is their own name and that my friend is
 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.870
is their own name and that my friend is
a fail there's a failed secret center

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880
a fail there's a failed secret center
 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.610
a fail there's a failed secret center
which means the only fair thing to do if

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620
which means the only fair thing to do if
 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.080
which means the only fair thing to do if
you want to preserve everyone lives is

there's only one name left in the hat
 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.500
there's only one name left in the hat
and that is a's name and that's actually

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510
and that is a's name and that's actually
 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.000
and that is a's name and that's actually
fine and that's got a probability of

fine and that's got a probability of
 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.760
fine and that's got a probability of
happening of one so that's if they ended

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770
happening of one so that's if they ended
 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.969

they did they'd read it they'd put it
 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.279
they did they'd read it they'd put it
back which means that B really only has

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289
back which means that B really only has
 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.710
back which means that B really only has
one name that they can pick out and the

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720
one name that they can pick out and the
 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.400

there's only one name in the Hat and
 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.920
there's only one name in the Hat and
it's B's name which also happens with

of the time the whole thing will then

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:40.479
of the time the whole thing will then
 

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:41.700
of the time the whole thing will then
fail so I have to start over from

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:41.710
fail so I have to start over from
 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.189
fail so I have to start over from
scratch so what you end up with in this

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:44.199
scratch so what you end up with in this
 

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:45.959
scratch so what you end up with in this
situation is not only the chance of

00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:45.969
situation is not only the chance of
 

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:47.519
situation is not only the chance of
failure and having to start all over

00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:47.529
failure and having to start all over
 

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:50.010
failure and having to start all over
again but you also end up with a

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:50.020
again but you also end up with a
 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.719
again but you also end up with a
situation which isn't perfectly random

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:51.729
situation which isn't perfectly random
 

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:53.429
situation which isn't perfectly random
you don't have an equal chance of

00:06:53.429 --> 00:06:53.439
you don't have an equal chance of
 

00:06:53.439 --> 00:06:54.600
you don't have an equal chance of
fighting for other people in the office

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:54.610
fighting for other people in the office
 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.760

so if I was sitting in a row of three

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:56.770
so if I was sitting in a row of three
 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.549
so if I was sitting in a row of three
and I'm the last picker I know

00:06:59.549 --> 00:06:59.559
and I'm the last picker I know
 

00:06:59.559 --> 00:07:01.799
and I'm the last picker I know
it's most likely that the first picker

00:07:01.799 --> 00:07:01.809
it's most likely that the first picker
 

00:07:01.809 --> 00:07:03.420
it's most likely that the first picker
is buying me a present

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:03.430
is buying me a present
 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.040
is buying me a present
yeah it's twice as likely that the first

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.050
yeah it's twice as likely that the first
 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.480
yeah it's twice as likely that the first
Pickers buying a present there's a

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:06.490
Pickers buying a present there's a
 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:08.339
Pickers buying a present there's a
second picker which might help you when

00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:08.349
second picker which might help you when
 

00:07:08.349 --> 00:07:09.420
second picker which might help you when
you try and decide where to sit around

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:09.430
you try and decide where to sit around
 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.510
you try and decide where to sit around
table because yeah you don't want like

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:12.520
table because yeah you don't want like
 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.700
table because yeah you don't want like
some person who's rubbish at presents to

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:14.710
some person who's rubbish at presents to
 

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.139
some person who's rubbish at presents to
be buying for you so the exact

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:16.149
be buying for you so the exact
 

00:07:16.149 --> 00:07:17.939
be buying for you so the exact
probabilities change depending on how

00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:17.949
probabilities change depending on how
 

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:20.399
probabilities change depending on how
many people you have but the overall

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:20.409
many people you have but the overall
 

00:07:20.409 --> 00:07:22.980
many people you have but the overall
idea is the same that the probability of

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:22.990
idea is the same that the probability of
 

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:26.189
idea is the same that the probability of
you buying for a person later on if you

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:26.199
you buying for a person later on if you
 

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:28.529
you buying for a person later on if you
go first is different to the probability

00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:28.539
go first is different to the probability
 

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:30.059
go first is different to the probability
of you buying for somebody you're on the

00:07:30.059 --> 00:07:30.069
of you buying for somebody you're on the
 

00:07:30.069 --> 00:07:32.909
of you buying for somebody you're on the
tree so overall I mean I think this

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:32.919
tree so overall I mean I think this
 

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:34.439
tree so overall I mean I think this
version of Secret Santas pretty rubbish

00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:34.449
version of Secret Santas pretty rubbish
 

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:36.869
version of Secret Santas pretty rubbish
really it's got two massive problems

00:07:36.869 --> 00:07:36.879
really it's got two massive problems
 

00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:38.369
really it's got two massive problems
with it so what you could do if you

00:07:38.369 --> 00:07:38.379
with it so what you could do if you
 

00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:40.619
with it so what you could do if you
wanted you wait until everyone's got a

00:07:40.619 --> 00:07:40.629
wanted you wait until everyone's got a
 

00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:42.089
wanted you wait until everyone's got a
name it was picked a name out of a hat

00:07:42.089 --> 00:07:42.099
name it was picked a name out of a hat
 

00:07:42.099 --> 00:07:44.159
name it was picked a name out of a hat
and that's when you look at it and

00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:44.169
and that's when you look at it and
 

00:07:44.169 --> 00:07:46.260
and that's when you look at it and
that's when you decide if if somebody's

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:46.270
that's when you decide if if somebody's
 

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.420
that's when you decide if if somebody's
got their own name you call the failure

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:48.430
got their own name you call the failure
 

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:49.350
got their own name you call the failure
and you start all over again

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.360
and you start all over again
 

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.209
and you start all over again

think people are gonna be less keen to
 

00:07:58.629 --> 00:08:00.179
think people are gonna be less keen to
buy each other presents and maybe just

00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:00.189
buy each other presents and maybe just
 

00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:04.170
buy each other presents and maybe just
want to call your day however we've got

what do you do now if you want the

00:08:09.809 --> 00:08:09.819
what do you do now if you want the
 

00:08:09.819 --> 00:08:12.119
what do you do now if you want the
perfect Secret Santa setup you create a

00:08:12.119 --> 00:08:12.129
perfect Secret Santa setup you create a
 

00:08:12.129 --> 00:08:14.579
perfect Secret Santa setup you create a
series of cards the cards are kind of

00:08:14.579 --> 00:08:14.589
series of cards the cards are kind of
 

00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:16.709
series of cards the cards are kind of
split in two and at the top of the card

00:08:16.709 --> 00:08:16.719
split in two and at the top of the card
 

00:08:16.719 --> 00:08:19.440
split in two and at the top of the card
you write you

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:19.450
you write you
 

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:21.780
you write you
four and on the bottom the card be right

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:21.790
four and on the bottom the card be right
 

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:26.640
four and on the bottom the card be right
ye buying number four say whatever the

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:26.650
ye buying number four say whatever the
 

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:28.140
ye buying number four say whatever the
number is on top the same number is on

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:28.150
number is on top the same number is on
 

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:29.460
number is on top the same number is on
bottom so you do lots of cards you do

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:29.470
bottom so you do lots of cards you do
 

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:30.570
bottom so you do lots of cards you do
one for each person so if you've got

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:30.580
one for each person so if you've got
 

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.160
one for each person so if you've got
twenty people you write twenty cards if

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:32.170
twenty people you write twenty cards if
 

00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:34.830
twenty people you write twenty cards if
you've got three people you write three

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:34.840
you've got three people you write three
 

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.810
you've got three people you write three
cards you get all of these cards you're

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:36.820
cards you get all of these cards you're
 

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.700
cards you get all of these cards you're
laying on a table shuffle them all round

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:38.710
laying on a table shuffle them all round
 

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:40.110
laying on a table shuffle them all round
so you have no idea what order they're

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:40.120
so you have no idea what order they're
 

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.970
so you have no idea what order they're
in and then when you're happy that

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:41.980
in and then when you're happy that
 

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:45.090
in and then when you're happy that
they're neatly shuffled you go along

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:45.100
they're neatly shuffled you go along
 

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.800
they're neatly shuffled you go along
with a pair of scissors and cut the

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:46.810
with a pair of scissors and cut the
 

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.830
with a pair of scissors and cut the
cards into so now you have no idea what

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:49.840
cards into so now you have no idea what
 

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.450
cards into so now you have no idea what
cards are next to each other and you're

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:51.460
cards are next to each other and you're
 

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:52.950
cards are next to each other and you're
kind of cutting along the line and

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:52.960
kind of cutting along the line and
 

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.360
kind of cutting along the line and
there's scissors that everyone draws in

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:54.370
there's scissors that everyone draws in
 

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:55.740
there's scissors that everyone draws in
school how do they do them like that

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:55.750
school how do they do them like that
 

00:08:55.750 --> 00:09:02.430
school how do they do them like that
they go it's not great you go along and

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:02.440
they go it's not great you go along and
 

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.020
they go it's not great you go along and
you cut them all up now at that point

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:04.030
you cut them all up now at that point
 

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:07.740
you cut them all up now at that point
you can create your derangement and you

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:07.750
you can create your derangement and you
 

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:10.170
you can create your derangement and you
can do that just by shifting the top

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:10.180
can do that just by shifting the top
 

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:12.360
can do that just by shifting the top
half of all of the cards along by one by

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:12.370
half of all of the cards along by one by
 

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:14.820
half of all of the cards along by one by
doing that you're guaranteeing that the

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:14.830
doing that you're guaranteeing that the
 

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:16.620
doing that you're guaranteeing that the
number on the top of the card isn't

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:16.630
number on the top of the card isn't
 

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:17.820
number on the top of the card isn't
going to match the number on the bottom

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:17.830
going to match the number on the bottom
 

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:19.470
going to match the number on the bottom
of the card so you've definitely got an

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:19.480
of the card so you've definitely got an
 

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.150
of the card so you've definitely got an
arrangement definitely got a secret Sun

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:21.160
arrangement definitely got a secret Sun
 

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.760
arrangement definitely got a secret Sun
system that works but also because you

for number 27 then the final thing that
 

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:45.030
for number 27 then the final thing that
happens is that you write a list of all

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.040
happens is that you write a list of all
 

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.560
