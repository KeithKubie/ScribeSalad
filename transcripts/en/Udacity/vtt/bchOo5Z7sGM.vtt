00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.469
So I've typed jQuery right here and I'll go ahead and press Enter.

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:05.302
And there it is.

00:00:05.302 --> 00:00:09.140
It's just a function that takes in a couple of parameters and returns something.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.960
Incidentally, JavaScript functions are also objects.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.580
So, the correct answer is that jQuery is a function and it's also an object.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.450
There's no magic or anything special going on.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:23.880
It's just JavaScript.
