00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.129
Things aren’t always what they might appear
to be. For example, this decorative houseplant

00:00:04.129 --> 00:00:08.639
you’re looking at, is actually an artfully
disguised, metal melting furnace. In this

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.079
project we’re using equal parts of sand
and plaster, to make a simple backyard foundry,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.400
that’s powerful enough to melt scrap metal
in seconds, but still pleasant enough keep

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.180
around for decoration.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.660
Let’s start this project with a big bag
of play sand, and some plaster of paris. Both

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.589
of which you can find at your local hardware
store, for under $20. We’re also gonna

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:39.000
need a 10 quart steel bucket, and a tablecloth
to cover anything important, because chances

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.449
are this is going to get a bit messy. I found
that this 2.5 quart bucket can be used for

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:46.930
measuring the ingredients, but it’ll also
serves a more important purpose that you’ll

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.370
see in just a second. Now the recipe I’m
using for this makeshift refractory lining,

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.810
is 1-3/4 buckets full (21 cups) of plaster
of paris, 1-3/4 buckets full (21 cups) of

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.500
sand. And 1-1/4 buckets, filled (15 cups)
with water. The moment the water touches the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.940
dry mix, the clock starts ticking and we’ve
only got about 15 minutes before it all hardens

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.790
up. So let’s get busy mixing everything
together. It’s really important to get all

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.870
the dry powder wet, and work out any lumps
as quickly as possible. And after mixing for

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.020
a couple of minutes, it should be fairly runny,
and roughly all the same color. Now when you’re

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.540
convinced there aren’t any clumps of powder
left in the bucket, the refractory mix is

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.900
ready for pouring. So let’s carefully transfer
it to the steel bucket as slowly as practical,

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.760
to minimize the splattering. There should
be just enough fluid to fill the bucket about

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.700
3” from the top, and now if we bring back
our plastic measuring bucket, we can use it

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.920
to form the center of the foundry. I filled
my bucket with water, to give it a bit of

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.820
weight, but anything like sand or rocks will
work as well. And you can see that as we push

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.580
the bucket into the center, the mixture rises
upward, but it doesn’t spill out. Now it’s

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.760
obvious that the mix is already starting to
firm up, so let’s try working the bucket

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.040
up and down a few times, to help level it
before it sets. And all we have to do now,

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.440
is hold still for 2 to 3 minutes. This will
give the plaster just enough time to harden,

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.380
so the bucket stays in place,even when we
let go. Alright, time for a little cleanup.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.420
Everything will still need about an hour to
really harden up, but the plaster’s still

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.789
soft enough that we can clean and shape it
to look really good. And while we’re here

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.629
we may as well wipe the bucket down as well.
Now I’ve found that if we dampen a rag and

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.790
gently drag it around the top, the surface
cleans up really nicely, and gets a cool texture

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.400
in the process. When it looks the way you
want it too, simply leave it for about an

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.159
hour. Now while we’re waiting, why don’t
we turn this old steel fire extinguisher,

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:28.459
into a custom crucible. You can tell it’s
made from steel because when we hold a magnet

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.439
to it, it sticks. And magnets won’t do that
to aluminum. I depressurized the tank and

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:37.739
unscrewed the valve from the top, to make
it safe and easy to cut in half with a hacksaw.

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.499
Which you can see just happened in less than
a minute. Now the bottom part of the extinguisher

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:45.939
is what we want for the crucible, because
it’s basically a steel cup 3” in diameter,

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:51.159
and 5” tall. That’s going to be perfect
for our custom backyard foundry. At this point,

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.500
the plaster should be pretty well set, so
let’s dump the water from the bucket, then

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.120
use something like a pair of channel locks,
to grip one edge of the pail, and pull gently

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.200
toward the center. Now if we grip it with
both hands and give it a bit of a twist, you

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.860
can see the whole bucket pops loose, and pulls
right out. This just created an amazingly

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.450
smooth surface, which gives this makeshift
foundry, a surprisingly professional look.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.150
The only features we’re missing now, are
an air supply port, and a lid, so let’s

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.320
make those next. Now I found a 1-3/8” (35mm)
hole saw was the perfect size for accomodating

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.239
this 1” steel tubing, and if we center the
metal cutting blade with the top line on the

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.329
bucket, we can carefully begin cutting through
the metal wall. Once we’re through the metal,

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.660
it’s easy to burrow down at about a 30º
angle because the plaster hasn’t fully cured yet,

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.240
and cuts away like butter. Now we have a tight,
downward sloping hole, that the blower tube

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:41.949
fits perfectly into, and it’s strategically
placed, a few inches up from the bottom. This

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:45.960
way, if a crucible fails, and dumps molten
metal into the foundry, it will stay in the

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:50.149
foundry, instead of dangerously flowing out
of the pipe. Now the blower tube is really

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:54.289
easy to make, and starts with a 1” steel
pipe like this. This is the “business end”

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:58.549
that'll sit next to the hot coals in the
foundry. We’re also going to need a 1" PVC

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.060
coupling (Slip x FIPT), as well as some 1”
PVC pipe. You can see the threads on one half of

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.959
the coupling screw onto the steel pipe, and
the slip adaptor on the other end, simply

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.399
pushes onto the PVC tube. It’s that easy.
Now let’s go one step further and make a

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.220
lid to help retain the heat. I got a couple
of 4” U-bolts from the hardware store and

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.920
stood them upright in a 5 quart, bigmouth
bucket, filled with a half-measure of our

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.180
insulating mix. (10 cups plaster, 10 cups
sand ,7 cups water). After an hour, you can

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.730
see the plaster has set, and the whole thing
pops free from the bucket, giving us a nice

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.340
little custom lid for the foundry. It still
needs a vent hole for relieving pressure buildup,

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.530
and you could just form one when you’re
casting it, or you could try drilling one

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.840
with a 3” hole cutting saw like this. With
the hole in the center, you can see we end

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.000
up with a nice thick lid, that kind of looks
like a giant white donut. This design works

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.760
great for venting pressure, and gives us the
option to melt metal as well, without even

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.610
having to take the lid off the furnace. Just
for fun, I picked up a can of “Burnished

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.180
Amber” spray paint, and gave the foundry
a couple of coatings to make it look a little

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.600
more attractive. If we get it fired up, you
can see the mini foundry gets so hot on the

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.990
inside, that it will melt soda cans within
seconds and fill a crucible with liquid aluminum.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.820
Look for how to do that, in another project
video. With this homemade furnace, we have

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.280
the power to liquify aluminum in the backyard,
and cast just about any object we can think

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.500
of. The best part is, when you’re not melting
scrap metals, rather than taking up space

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.070
and looking terrible, you can drop in a plant,
and instantly transform it, into fashionable

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.430
home decor. With this transforming “Flowerpot
Foundry”, there’s certainly “more than

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.210
meets the eye”. And by the way, if you run
out of soda cans to melt, you could try using

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.680
it as a blacksmithing forge, or even a bbq,
for summertime grilling. After all, it is

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.530
fueled by charcoal briquettes. Well now you
know, how to use commonly available materials,

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.960
to build the mini metal foundry. Powerful
enough to melt metal in seconds, but still

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.430
pleasant enough keep around for decoration.
Well that’s it for now. If you liked this

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:53.430
project, perhaps you’ll like some of my
