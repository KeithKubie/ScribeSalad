PAIGE BAILEY: Hi.

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.060
I'm Paige from the
TensorFlow team.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.090
And you may have heard
that on March 6 and 7

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.390
we're hosting the
TensorFlow Dev Summit live,

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.490
in person and online.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.620
We're bringing together
a mix of machine

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.530
learning users from around the
world for two days of highly

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.710
technical talks, demos,
and conversations

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.620
with the TensorFlow
team and our community.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.790
The keynote address and
lots of the top sessions

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.320
will be live streamed
on TensorFlow.org.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.710
So be sure to head there
now to sign up for updates.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.740
And since TensorFlow is
all about open source

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.410
collaboration, we
want to hear from you.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.260
Send us your
TensorFlow questions

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.110
now with the hashtag
Ask TensorFlow.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.020
And I'll be there with my
co-host Laurence Moroney

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.110
to answer as many as we can
during the live stream on March

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.040
6.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.970
See you there.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.320
