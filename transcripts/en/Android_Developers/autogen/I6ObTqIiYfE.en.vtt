hi I'm Dan Morrill with Google developer
 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.240
hi I'm Dan Morrill with Google developer
programs I bet by now you've seen the

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250
programs I bet by now you've seen the
 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.740
programs I bet by now you've seen the
application demos that we've posted

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750
application demos that we've posted
 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.629
application demos that we've posted
online and I hope you're as excited by

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639
online and I hope you're as excited by
 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.000
online and I hope you're as excited by
them as we are but if you're a developer

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010
them as we are but if you're a developer
 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.950
them as we are but if you're a developer
you know there's more to it than just a

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960
you know there's more to it than just a
 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.410
you know there's more to it than just a
fancy demo it has to be easy to build

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420
fancy demo it has to be easy to build
 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.540
fancy demo it has to be easy to build
those applications as well and that's

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550
those applications as well and that's
 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.550
those applications as well and that's
what I'm here today to show you I'm

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560
what I'm here today to show you I'm
 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.349
what I'm here today to show you I'm
going to build an application for

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359
going to build an application for
 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.599
going to build an application for
Android using nothing but the tools that

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609
Android using nothing but the tools that
 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.000
Android using nothing but the tools that
are included in our SDK let's get

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010
are included in our SDK let's get
 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.250

started the first thing we have to do is

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260
started the first thing we have to do is
 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.169
started the first thing we have to do is
create a new project see i'm using

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179
create a new project see i'm using
 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.919

eclipse
 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.299
eclipse
and to create the project I just go to

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309
and to create the project I just go to
 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.940
and to create the project I just go to
file project and the project I'm going

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950
file project and the project I'm going
 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.700
file project and the project I'm going
to create as an Android project the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710
to create as an Android project the
 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.410
to create as an Android project the
project name can be whatever you want in

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420
project name can be whatever you want in
 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.880
project name can be whatever you want in
this case I'm going to call it hello

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890
this case I'm going to call it hello
 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.240
this case I'm going to call it hello

name of your application and this is
what will appear in the title bar and

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409
what will appear in the title bar and
 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.960
what will appear in the title bar and
window and so on so once we've entered

that data we go ahead and click finish
 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.940
that data we go ahead and click finish
and there's our application what did

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950
and there's our application what did
 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.670
and there's our application what did
this create well if you look in the tree

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680
this create well if you look in the tree
 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.260
this create well if you look in the tree
over here you'll see that we have a

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270
over here you'll see that we have a
 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.330
over here you'll see that we have a
source directory including the file

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340
source directory including the file
 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.999
source directory including the file
hello Android Java this is the entry

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009
hello Android Java this is the entry
 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.800
hello Android Java this is the entry
point file to the application this is

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810
point file to the application this is
 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.510
point file to the application this is
the class that Android runs when you

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520
the class that Android runs when you
 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.640
the class that Android runs when you
start the application let's build an

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650
start the application let's build an
 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.929
start the application let's build an
application that knows how to dial the

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939
application that knows how to dial the
 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.700
application that knows how to dial the
phone specifically let's build an

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710
phone specifically let's build an
 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.260
phone specifically let's build an
application that lists everyone in my

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270
application that lists everyone in my
 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.120
application that lists everyone in my
contact list lets me scroll around

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130
contact list lets me scroll around
 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.310
contact list lets me scroll around
choose one and then when I select it

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320
choose one and then when I select it
 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.600
choose one and then when I select it
goes ahead and dials that phone number

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610
goes ahead and dials that phone number
 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.210
goes ahead and dials that phone number
let's see how that's built the first

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220
let's see how that's built the first
 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.190
let's see how that's built the first
thing that we want to do is check out

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200
thing that we want to do is check out
 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.440
thing that we want to do is check out
this file over here called main dot XML

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450
this file over here called main dot XML
 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.319
this file over here called main dot XML
in the layout directory this file is

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329
in the layout directory this file is
 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.749
in the layout directory this file is
what we refer to as an XML based layout

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759
what we refer to as an XML based layout
 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.450
what we refer to as an XML based layout
so in this file as you can see right now

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460
so in this file as you can see right now
 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.170
so in this file as you can see right now
it has only a single text view that just

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180
it has only a single text view that just
 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.060
it has only a single text view that just
displays some hello world text so the

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070
displays some hello world text so the
 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.499
displays some hello world text so the
first thing we want to do is change that

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509
first thing we want to do is change that
 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.270
first thing we want to do is change that
text so that it no longer says hello

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280
text so that it no longer says hello
 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.209
text so that it no longer says hello
world and instead has this label instead

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219
world and instead has this label instead
 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.039
world and instead has this label instead
called

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049
called
 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.620
called
name then we're going to copy that

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630
name then we're going to copy that
 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.389
name then we're going to copy that
because we want two of these and then

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399
because we want two of these and then
 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.559
because we want two of these and then
once we've copied that we're going to

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569
once we've copied that we're going to
 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.250
once we've copied that we're going to
move down a little bit and paste it and

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260
move down a little bit and paste it and
 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.970
move down a little bit and paste it and
now we've got two copies

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980
now we've got two copies
 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.979
now we've got two copies
for the second copy we're going to

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989
for the second copy we're going to
 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.540
for the second copy we're going to
remove this text because we don't want

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550
remove this text because we don't want
 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.729
remove this text because we don't want
it to have fixed text in this case we

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739
it to have fixed text in this case we
 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.979
it to have fixed text in this case we
want it to have an ID instead because

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989
want it to have an ID instead because
 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.170
want it to have an ID instead because
we're going to refer to the ID from our

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180
we're going to refer to the ID from our
 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.380
we're going to refer to the ID from our
source code and so there we are now

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390
source code and so there we are now
 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.509
source code and so there we are now
we've got our XML based layout file the

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519
we've got our XML based layout file the
 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:30.619
we've got our XML based layout file the
first thing that we need to do is come

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629
first thing that we need to do is come
 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.479
first thing that we need to do is come
up here to the hello Android class

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489
up here to the hello Android class
 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.270
up here to the hello Android class
currently it implements or extends the

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280
currently it implements or extends the
 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.940
currently it implements or extends the
class activity we actually need it to

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950
class activity we actually need it to
 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.380
class activity we actually need it to
extend a different class called list

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390
extend a different class called list
 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.250
extend a different class called list
activity list activity is a convenient

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260
activity list activity is a convenient
 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.710
activity list activity is a convenient
subclass that really just says I'm going

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720
subclass that really just says I'm going
 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.390
subclass that really just says I'm going
to display a list orient information and

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400
to display a list orient information and
 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.550
to display a list orient information and
it's got a whole bunch of useful methods

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560
it's got a whole bunch of useful methods
 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.770
it's got a whole bunch of useful methods
that we can take advantage of for this

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780
that we can take advantage of for this
 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.910
that we can take advantage of for this
application so that we don't have to

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920
application so that we don't have to
 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.800
application so that we don't have to
write them ourselves the first thing

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810
write them ourselves the first thing
 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.449
write them ourselves the first thing
that we're going to do is get access to

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459
that we're going to do is get access to
 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.580
that we're going to do is get access to
some data the Android way of doing that

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590
some data the Android way of doing that
 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.650
some data the Android way of doing that
is to use what's known as a content

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660
is to use what's known as a content
 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.720
is to use what's known as a content
provider we get access to the content

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730
provider we get access to the content
 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.400
provider we get access to the content
provider system via this method call

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410
provider system via this method call
 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.619
provider system via this method call
here and what that does is it lets us

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629
here and what that does is it lets us
 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.449
here and what that does is it lets us
issue a query in this case we're

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459
issue a query in this case we're
 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.789
issue a query in this case we're
querying the system for the entire list

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799
querying the system for the entire list
 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.319
querying the system for the entire list
of contacts that are available on the

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329
of contacts that are available on the
 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.559
of contacts that are available on the
phone in response we get a cursor the

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569
phone in response we get a cursor the
 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.349
phone in response we get a cursor the
cursor is what we use to actually access

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359
cursor is what we use to actually access
 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.449
cursor is what we use to actually access
specific data from the query that we

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459
specific data from the query that we
 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.479
specific data from the query that we
requested now we have to tell the UI

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489
requested now we have to tell the UI
 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.339
requested now we have to tell the UI
exactly what we want to display because

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349
exactly what we want to display because
 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.199
exactly what we want to display because
of course the contact list consists of a

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209
of course the contact list consists of a
 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.729
of course the contact list consists of a
lot more than just say a first name and

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739
lot more than just say a first name and
 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.409
lot more than just say a first name and
a phone number it might also have an

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419
a phone number it might also have an
 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.479
a phone number it might also have an
email address or a mobile phone number

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489
email address or a mobile phone number
 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.360
email address or a mobile phone number
and a home phone number and so on so

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370
and a home phone number and so on so
 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.539
and a home phone number and so on so
what we're going to do is create a

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549
what we're going to do is create a
 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:42.789
what we're going to do is create a
mapping and the mapping tells us which

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799
mapping and the mapping tells us which
 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.530
mapping and the mapping tells us which
column or name in the content provider

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540
column or name in the content provider
 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.379
column or name in the content provider
that we want to map to which UI element

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389
that we want to map to which UI element
 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.720
that we want to map to which UI element
and so in this specific case we want to

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730
and so in this specific case we want to
 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.569
and so in this specific case we want to
say people name which is to say the

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579
say people name which is to say the
 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.869
say people name which is to say the
person's name gets mapped to the entry

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879
person's name gets mapped to the entry
 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.089
person's name gets mapped to the entry
that we called row entry in our XML

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099
that we called row entry in our XML
 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.860
that we called row entry in our XML
layout and so just to refresh your

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870
layout and so just to refresh your
 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.390
layout and so just to refresh your
memory I'll switch back to that file and

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400
memory I'll switch back to that file and
 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.569
memory I'll switch back to that file and
show you right here you can see that we

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579
show you right here you can see that we
 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.220
show you right here you can see that we
have an ID that we could be that we

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230
have an ID that we could be that we
 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.710
have an ID that we could be that we
created and called row entry and then we

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720
created and called row entry and then we
 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.759
created and called row entry and then we
call this method set list adapter and

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769
call this method set list adapter and
 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.439
call this method set list adapter and
the list adapter itself is an instance

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:15.449
the list adapter itself is an instance
 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:16.849
the list adapter itself is an instance
of another class called simple cursor

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859
of another class called simple cursor
 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.949
of another class called simple cursor
adapter and that's a class that really

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959
adapter and that's a class that really
 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.870
adapter and that's a class that really
has all the smarts and all the logic in

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880
has all the smarts and all the logic in
 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.580
has all the smarts and all the logic in
it to make use of the mapping that we

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590
it to make use of the mapping that we
 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.620
it to make use of the mapping that we
just declared so to summarize this

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630
just declared so to summarize this
 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.170
just declared so to summarize this
method real quick first we get the data

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180
method real quick first we get the data
 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.810
method real quick first we get the data
then we map the data from the data

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820
then we map the data from the data
 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.510
then we map the data from the data
source to the user interface then we

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520
source to the user interface then we
 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.650
source to the user interface then we
create a class that knows how to

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660
create a class that knows how to
 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.240
create a class that knows how to
actually accomplish that mapping and

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250
actually accomplish that mapping and
 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.850
actually accomplish that mapping and
then we set that to be our current

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860
then we set that to be our current
 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.830
then we set that to be our current
adapter once we've done that that will

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840
adapter once we've done that that will
 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.540
adapter once we've done that that will
display things in other words it'll show

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550
display things in other words it'll show
 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.550
display things in other words it'll show
us a list of all our contacts but what

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560
us a list of all our contacts but what
 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.260
us a list of all our contacts but what
it won't do is it won't let us click on

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270
it won't do is it won't let us click on
 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.270
it won't do is it won't let us click on
any of them to click on them we have to

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280
any of them to click on them we have to
 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.420
any of them to click on them we have to
come over here and do one last thing we

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430
come over here and do one last thing we
 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.580
come over here and do one last thing we
need to go to the source and then

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590
need to go to the source and then
 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.879
need to go to the source and then
override a method the method that we

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889
override a method the method that we
 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:57.439
override a method the method that we
want to override is down here towards

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449
want to override is down here towards
 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:58.700
want to override is down here towards
the bottom and it's called

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710
the bottom and it's called
 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.779
the bottom and it's called
on list item click click ok and there

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:02.789
on list item click click ok and there
 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:04.909
on list item click click ok and there
we've got a method body what this method

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919
we've got a method body what this method
 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:06.230
we've got a method body what this method
does is this is the method that's called

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240
does is this is the method that's called
 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.909
does is this is the method that's called
every time the user actually clicks

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919
every time the user actually clicks
 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.400
every time the user actually clicks
something in the user interface in this

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410
something in the user interface in this
 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.129
something in the user interface in this
specific case we want it to dial the

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139
specific case we want it to dial the
 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:14.779
specific case we want it to dial the
phone and so the first thing that we

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789
phone and so the first thing that we
 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:16.999
phone and so the first thing that we
need to do is create a class called

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:17.009
need to do is create a class called
 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:21.499
need to do is create a class called
intent in an intent is really a columns

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:21.509
intent in an intent is really a columns
 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:23.629
intent in an intent is really a columns
kind of a generic concept what it means

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639
kind of a generic concept what it means
 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:25.520
kind of a generic concept what it means
is it's a reflection of an applications

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530
is it's a reflection of an applications
 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.640
is it's a reflection of an applications
intention to perform some activity so I

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650
intention to perform some activity so I
 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.860
intention to perform some activity so I
create an intent object and I say that

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870
create an intent object and I say that
 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.510
create an intent object and I say that
the specific activity that I wanted to

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520
the specific activity that I wanted to
 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.969
the specific activity that I wanted to
perform is call action which means dial

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979
perform is call action which means dial
 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:36.409
perform is call action which means dial
the phone obviously I need to tell it

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419
the phone obviously I need to tell it
 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.659
the phone obviously I need to tell it
what number to dial and so I go to the

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669
what number to dial and so I go to the
 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:41.029
what number to dial and so I go to the
cursor that I got from the content

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039
cursor that I got from the content
 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.600
cursor that I got from the content
provider I query the adapter for the

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610
provider I query the adapter for the
 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.370
provider I query the adapter for the
specific row that the user clicked on I

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380
specific row that the user clicked on I
 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.250
specific row that the user clicked on I
extract a little bit of data from it I

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260
extract a little bit of data from it I
 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.050
extract a little bit of data from it I
set that data on the intent so that now

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060
set that data on the intent so that now
 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.310
set that data on the intent so that now
the intent knows what it's supposed to

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320
the intent knows what it's supposed to
 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.409
the intent knows what it's supposed to
do and then finally I call this method

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419
do and then finally I call this method
 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:59.360
do and then finally I call this method
startactivity so when we call

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370
startactivity so when we call
 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.460
startactivity so when we call
startactivity that's will actually cause

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470
startactivity that's will actually cause
 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:02.990
startactivity that's will actually cause
the dialer to appear on the screen and

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000
the dialer to appear on the screen and
 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.659
the dialer to appear on the screen and
initiate the phone call but certain

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:05.669
initiate the phone call but certain
 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:07.969
initiate the phone call but certain
operations that the device supports such

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:07.979
operations that the device supports such
 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:09.800
operations that the device supports such
as dialing the phone and accessing the

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810
as dialing the phone and accessing the
 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.110
as dialing the phone and accessing the
users contact list are protected and the

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120
users contact list are protected and the
 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.270
users contact list are protected and the
user needs to grant permission before an

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280
user needs to grant permission before an
 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.480
user needs to grant permission before an
application can access them and so we

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490
application can access them and so we
 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.300
application can access them and so we
have to request that permission via our

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.310
have to request that permission via our
 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.460
have to request that permission via our
Android manifest so if we come over here

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470
Android manifest so if we come over here
 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:23.870
Android manifest so if we come over here
and double-click on this Android

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880
and double-click on this Android
 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.719
and double-click on this Android
manifest file you'll see that there's

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:26.729
manifest file you'll see that there's
 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:29.390
manifest file you'll see that there's
already in here a definition of what the

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400
already in here a definition of what the
 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.670
already in here a definition of what the
contents of our application are which is

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680
contents of our application are which is
 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.050
contents of our application are which is
what Android manifest does it's sort of

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060
what Android manifest does it's sort of
 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.790
what Android manifest does it's sort of
the traffic cop of your application it

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800
the traffic cop of your application it
 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.580
the traffic cop of your application it
specifies its contents as well as what

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590
specifies its contents as well as what
 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.950
specifies its contents as well as what
it does so what we need to do is add two

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960
it does so what we need to do is add two
 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.060
it does so what we need to do is add two
lines to this

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070
lines to this

application framework we've really tried
 

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.430
application framework we've really tried
to make it this easy to use and I think

to make it this easy to use and I think
 

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.530
to make it this easy to use and I think
that as you you know explore Android

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:43.540
that as you you know explore Android
 

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.690
that as you you know explore Android
you'll find it to be very easy and

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:45.700
you'll find it to be very easy and
 

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.790
you'll find it to be very easy and
pleasant to develop for I hope that

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:47.800
pleasant to develop for I hope that
 

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.990
