00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.389
Superhero movies play a huge role in pop culture
today and when a new movie is revealed, fans

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:14.759
need to know almost immediately who the studios
have cast for their favorite characters.

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.369
With so many actors clamoring to play these
iconic heroes and villains, changes are often

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.050
made at the drop of a hat.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.200
One day, you hear your favorite actor will
play your favorite comic book character, and

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.689
then the next day, they’re out.

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.620
When you hear of Christian Bale as Batman,
Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man, Henry Cavill

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.710
as Superman, Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and
Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, it’s not

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.780
hard to imagine them playing the parts since
all the actors killed it in their roles, respectively.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.250
But these characters could have easily been
played by other actors.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.800
In this list we will take a look at some A-listers
who lost out to portraying classic comic characters.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.719
Check out these 10 actors who ALMOST became
a Marvel superhero.

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:07.700

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.950
Emily Blunt as Black Widow
Scarlett Johansson has impressed Marvel fans

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.140
as the former KGB spy turned SHIELD agent
Natasha Romanova, but believe it or not, she

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.240
wasn’t the first choice for the role.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.860
Emily Blunt was actually set to play the role
of Black Widow.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.050
She literally had the role in “Iron Man
2,” but due to contract obligations with

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.360
Fox, she had to drop out.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.740
Instead of being our Black Widow she co-starred
in “Gulliver’s Travels” alongside Jack

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:36.740
Black.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.720
Dougray Scott as Wolverine
We have seen Hugh Jackman as the clawed and

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.430
rugged hero Wolverine for 17 years now, but
it would surprise you to know he wasn’t

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.670
the original choice.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.560
In Bryan Singer’s first “X-Men” film,
Dougray Scott was cast as Logan.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.560
However, the British actor was forced to drop
out due to a scheduling conflict.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.391
Scott was reportedly hand-picked by Tom Cruise
to play the villain in “Mission: Impossible

00:01:59.391 --> 00:02:03.830
II,” which made it impossible for the actor
to stay onboard with “X-Men.”

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.789
Viggo Mortensen as Wolverine
Again, it’s hard to imagine Wolverine not

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.870
being played by Hugh Jackman but there are
a few names that had potential to do the role

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.980
justice.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.550
Aside from Russell Crowe, who was Singer’s
first choice, and Dougray Scott, who was cast

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.880
in the part, another actor was a strand of
hair close to becoming Wolverine.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.290
That is none other than Aragorn himself: Viggo
Mortensen.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.000
Luckily we’ve seen Mortensen in action as
Aragorn so picturing him as Logan is no problem

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
at all.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.790
While Mortensen never had the chance to play
the regenerative clawed-mutant, the actor

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.630
will always be remembered as the Ranger of
the North, Aragorn, from “Lord of the Rings.”

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.351
Jim Caviezel as Cyclops
Before James Marsden was cast as Cyclops in

00:02:48.351 --> 00:02:52.130
Singer’s “X-Men,” the role was offered
to Jim Caviezel.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.910
The actor apparently beat out a long list
of A-list actors who auditioned for the role

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.959
including: Thomas Jane, Owen Wilson, Edward
Norton, Jude Law and a bunch of others.

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.010
Unfortunately, Caviezel had to drop out due
to his commitment to the film “Frequency.”

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.870
Apparently, this move also disqualified him
from getting the Superman role in Singer’s

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.210
“Superman Returns.”

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.880
Guess Singer didn’t want Jesus playing the
man of steel.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.800
Tom Cruise as Iron Man
Before Robert Downey Jr. landed the role as

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:27.300
billionaire playboy Tony Stark, Tom Cruise
was a frontrunner to play the mechanical hero.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.710
The actor and the studio execs were in talks
for a while, but Cruise eventually lost interest

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.590
in the film and walked away.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.190
He just didn’t feel like it was a project
he could commit himself to 100 percent.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.799
It all worked out for the best as Downey Jr.
is perhaps the best Tony Stark Marvel could

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:43.799
get.

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:49.700
Jon Favreau also looked into casting Clive
Owen and Sam Rockwell in the role.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.890
John Krasinski as Captain America
Chris Evans has dominated the role of Steve

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.070
Rogers aka Captain America, but there was
another actor close to nabbing the role.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.520
John Krasinski — more popularly know as
Jim from “The Office” — was the highest

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.760
name of the list of actors to play Cap.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.549
He beat out actors like Channing Tatum, Ryan
Phillippe, Mike Vogel and Garrett Hedlund.

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:14.880
Then from out of nowhere, Chris Evans jumped
into the role without even having to audition

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.030
and the rest is history.

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.620
Channing Tatum as Thor
A lot of people know that Tom Hiddleston auditioned

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.500
as Loki and brothers Liam and Chris Hemsworth
battled against each other for the role of

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.500
Thor.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.760
But little know that actor and dancer Channing
Tatum was a top choice for the God of Thunder.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.560
The Magic Mike star reportedly met with director
Kenneth Branagh to talk about the role.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.530
All went well, but the Irish director ended
up going with the eldest Hemsworth.

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.260
Unfortunately, the hammer Mjölnir is out
of reach for Tatum, but if you’re dying

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:51.280
to see him as a superhero you’ll get your
chance when he plays the mutant Gambit.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.610
Sigourney Weaver as Emma Frost
Before Bryan Singer departed from “X-Men:

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:55.610
The Last Stand,” the director planned to
introduce Emma Frost, also known as The White

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:56.610
Queen.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.470
The initial plan was to bring Frost in as
an empath villainess who would manipulate

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.560
Jean Grey and later on join Magneto to help
undo the heroes.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.120
But when Singer left to focus on “Superman
Returns,” so did Sigourney Weaver’s appearance

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.400
as Emma Frost.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.780
The director wanted Weaver as the villainess,
but her appearance was scrapped from the script.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.760
The character was brought back for “X-Men:
First Class,” but January Jones was given

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.030
the role.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.320
Rachael Leigh Cook as Rogue
While Anna Paquin didn’t give us the butt

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.630
kicking, tough as nails Rogue from the comics,
she did bring the southern belle charm to

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:28.630
life.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.710
But it will interest you to know Bryan Singer
offered the role to another actress first.

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.190
“She’s All That” star Racheal Leigh
Cook was offered the role of Rogue before

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.590
Paquin in the 2000 “X-Men” movie.

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.490
The actress turned it down because she didn't
like the idea of seeing too much CGI in the

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.390
film and went on to star in the musical comedy
“Josie and the Pussycats” instead.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:54.580
A lot of actors as Spider-Man
Spidey is arguably one of the most recognized

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.380
Marvel superheroes around, so it’s no surprise
lots of actors jump at the chance to play

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.660
the web-slinger.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.200
Many big name actors were in talks to play
Spider-Man including Tom Cruise, Leonardo

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.890
DiCaprio, Jude Law and Heath Ledger.

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.750
Even actors who were in previous Spider-Man
movies wanted the big role for themselves.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.900
James Franco read for the lead in Sam Raimi’s
“Spider-Man” but was ultimately beaten

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.000
to the prize by Toby Maguire.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.740
Franco confessed that he was disappointed
when the director called him to let him know

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.590
he didn’t get the part, though he softened
the blow when he instead offered the him the

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:32.610
part of Harry Osborn, son of the Green Goblin
and Peter Parker's best friend.

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.510
Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe recently
revealed he was interested in becoming the

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.380
new MCU Spider-Man.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:43.040
While giving his fellow countryman Tom Holland
a congratulations on landing the part, he

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:48.350
talked about how he wanted to be the new hero
but also mentioned how it was now out of reach.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:52.230
"I would have made a good Spider-Man, but
the boat has sailed on that one,” said Radcliffe.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.870
“I'm not sure if I'd sign up for something
that was another seven or eight films or ten

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.630
years, but a shorter franchise, yeah.”

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:01.030
What do you think of our list?

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.520
