00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.430
Welcome to the presentation on exponents.

00:00:04.696 --> 00:00:07.012
If I were to ask you what

00:00:07.012 --> 00:00:11.570
-- let me make sure this pen is the right width--

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.860
if I were to ask you what two times three is,

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.110
well I think at this point this should be pretty easy for you.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:25.190
That's the same thing as two plus two plus two, which equals six.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.840
You didn't have to do this.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.595
You all know that two times three is equal to six.

00:00:30.595 --> 00:00:32.465
So what we're going to do now is

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:37.136
we're going to learn exponents which are the same thing

00:00:37.136 --> 00:00:41.730
that multiplication is to addition, exponents are to multiplication.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.163
I'll explain that in a second.

00:00:43.163 --> 00:00:44.740
I know that probably confused you.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:50.380
If I were to say what two to the third power is,

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.709
instead of two plus two plus two,

00:00:52.709 --> 00:01:02.070
this is equal to two times two times two, which equals eight.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.640
Or if I were to say three the second power,

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.160
that is equal to three times three.

00:01:13.344 --> 00:01:19.870
Remember, I said three times two would be three plus three.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.620
So the first three times three this equals nine,

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.940
and three plus three equals six.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.165
The reason why I'm doing this is because there's always this temptation

00:01:28.165 --> 00:01:30.504
when you first learn exponents is to multiply.

00:01:30.504 --> 00:01:33.812
When I first learned it and I saw three to the second power or three squared,

00:01:33.812 --> 00:01:35.631
I'd always be like oh, that's six.

00:01:35.631 --> 00:01:37.898
But you also remember it's three times three,

00:01:37.898 --> 00:01:40.035
which equals nine.

00:01:40.035 --> 00:01:42.640
Let's do some more problems.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:52.710
If I were to tell you negative four squared.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.969
Once again, that's the same thing as

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:01.250
negative four times negative four.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.540
Well, we all learn from multiplying negative numbers

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.540
that a negative times a negative is a positive.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.861
And then four times four,

00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:10.029
well this equals positive sixteen.

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:11.584
You don't have to write the positive,

00:02:11.584 --> 00:02:13.369
I'm just doing that for emphasis.

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:19.584
If I would ask you what negative four to the third power is,

00:02:19.584 --> 00:02:26.440
well that equals negative four times negative four

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.620
times negative four.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.340
Well we know already that negative four times negative four,

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.130
that this equals sixteen, positive sixteen,

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.470
and then we multiply that times negative four.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.490
And then that equals minus sixty-four.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.720
So something very interesting here to observe.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.267
When I took a negative number,

00:02:46.267 --> 00:02:47.968
and we call this the base,

00:02:47.968 --> 00:02:49.134
when the base is negative,

00:02:49.134 --> 00:02:50.454
in this case, negative four,

00:02:50.681 --> 00:02:53.248
and I raise it to an even power,

00:02:53.248 --> 00:02:55.552
I got a positive number, right?

00:02:55.552 --> 00:02:58.553
Negative four to an even power is positive sixteen,

00:02:58.553 --> 00:03:02.600
and when I took a negative number to an odd power, to three,

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.984
I got a negative number.

00:03:03.984 --> 00:03:06.332
And that makes sense because every time

00:03:06.332 --> 00:03:08.298
you multiply by a negative number again,

00:03:08.298 --> 00:03:09.749
it switches signs.

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:12.189
I'll show you the, I guess you'd call it

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:13.939
the simplest example.

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:18.580
Negative one to the one power is equal to negative one, right?

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.930
Because that's just negative one times itself one time.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.877
And if I said negative one squared,

00:03:26.877 --> 00:03:29.435
well that's negative one times negative one,

00:03:29.435 --> 00:03:32.418
well that equals positive one.

00:03:32.418 --> 00:03:39.584
But if I said negative one to the third power,

00:03:39.584 --> 00:03:44.750
once again that's negative one times negative one times negative one.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.850
Well now this equals negative one times negative one is positive one

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.340
times negative one equals negative one again.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.803
So I could tell you

00:03:51.803 --> 00:03:56.070
what negative one to the fifty-first power is.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.892
Because fifty-one is odd,

00:03:57.892 --> 00:04:01.322
we know that that is equal to negative one.

00:04:01.322 --> 00:04:03.250
If it was a fifty then it would be a positive one.

00:04:03.468 --> 00:04:05.510
Hope I didn't confuse you too much.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.932
Let's do a couple more problems.

00:04:08.932 --> 00:04:13.059
If I asked you what five to the third power is,

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:19.207
well that will go into five times five times five,

00:04:19.207 --> 00:04:22.601
which equals one hundred and twenty-five.

00:04:22.601 --> 00:04:23.935
So really if I were ask to ask

00:04:23.935 --> 00:04:27.703
what negative five to the third power is,

00:04:27.703 --> 00:04:36.326
that would be negative five times negative five times negative five,

00:04:36.326 --> 00:04:39.910
which would be negative one hundred and twenty-five.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.686
Now one principle of exponents

00:04:41.686 --> 00:04:45.060
that might not seem completely intuitive to you at first

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.869
is when I raise something to the zero power.

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:51.111
So let's say I had two to the zero power.

00:04:51.111 --> 00:04:54.200
It turns out that anything to the zero power is equal to one.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.442
So two to the zero power is one,

00:04:56.442 --> 00:05:00.384
three to the zero power is equal to one,

00:05:00.384 --> 00:05:07.471
negative nine hundred to the zero power is equal to one.

00:05:07.471 --> 00:05:09.571
And let me see if I can give you a little bit of intuition of

00:05:09.571 --> 00:05:13.009
why that is actually the case.

00:05:15.916 --> 00:05:17.981
So if I were to ask you,

00:05:17.981 --> 00:05:23.231
let's do three to the fourth power.

00:05:23.231 --> 00:05:29.265
That equals three times three times three times three,

00:05:29.265 --> 00:05:32.249
which equals eighty-one.

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:38.200
three to the third power is equal to twenty-seven,

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.132
this three times three times three.

00:05:41.132 --> 00:05:46.930
three to second power is equal to nine.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:52.790
three to the first power is equal to three.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.753
Now we're going to say what's three to zero power?

00:05:54.753 --> 00:05:56.357
Well we already know, I already told you the rule,

00:05:56.357 --> 00:05:58.103
anything with the zero power is equal to one,

00:05:58.103 --> 00:06:00.040
but this will hopefully give you some intuition.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.490
When we went from the fourth power to the third power,

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.640
we divided by three, right?

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.240
eighty-one divided by three is twenty-seven.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.048
When you went from the third power to the second power,

00:06:11.048 --> 00:06:13.490
we divided by three.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.230
When we went from the second power from nine to three,

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.350
we divided by three.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.744
So it kind of makes logical sense that

00:06:19.744 --> 00:06:22.478
when we go from the first power to the zero power,

00:06:22.478 --> 00:06:25.911
we'll just divide by three again.

00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:27.890
So three divided by three is one.

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.032
Hopefully that gives you a little bit of an intuitive sense.

00:06:30.032 --> 00:06:33.480
You might want to replay that and think about why that is.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.270
And there's actually other aspects of exponents that

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:37.719
why this also makes sense,

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:39.683
why something to the zero power

00:06:39.683 --> 00:06:41.202
is equal to one.

00:06:41.202 --> 00:06:42.960
But let's just do some more problems in the time we have.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.750
I don't want to get you too confused.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.600
So if I were to ask you seven squared,

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.720
well that's seven times seven, that's forty-nine.

00:06:53.797 --> 00:07:00.789
If I asked you negative six to the third power

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.419
-- parentheses around here so you know it's a whole negative six to the third power--

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:09.086
that equals negative six times negative six times negative six.

00:07:09.117 --> 00:07:15.319
Negative six times negative six is positive thirty-six times negative six,

00:07:15.381 --> 00:07:16.730
and that equals what?

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.127
It's one hundred and eighty and thirty-six,

00:07:20.127 --> 00:07:22.164
that's minus two hundred and sixteen,

00:07:22.164 --> 00:07:24.296
if my mental math is correct.

00:07:24.296 --> 00:07:27.332
You could have actually multiplied it out.

00:07:27.594 --> 00:07:31.200
I think you're getting the point at this point.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.344
Oh, and another thing,

00:07:32.344 --> 00:07:35.176
if I told you zero to the hundredth power,

00:07:35.176 --> 00:07:36.290
well, that's pretty easy.

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:39.021
That's zero times itself one hundred times,

00:07:39.021 --> 00:07:41.940
which is still equal to zero.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:49.340
If I were to ask you one to the thousandth power,

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:50.370
well that's just equal to one, right?

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:52.930
You can multiply one by itself as many times as you want

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.750
and you're still going to get one.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:59.430
And remember, if I had negative one to the one thousandth power,

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:02.910
well, this is an even exponent so you're still going to get one.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.960
If it was negative one to the one thousand and one,

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.870
then it would be negative one.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:09.672
I think you remember why this is,

00:08:09.672 --> 00:08:12.540
because when you multiply a negative times itself an even number of times,

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.550
the negatives cancel out.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:16.445
And then if you multiply it by a negative one more time

00:08:16.445 --> 00:08:17.970
it becomes a negative number again.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:19.430
Well let's just do some normal problems.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.699
I just want to make sure you get the basics of exponents down.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:25.682
If I were to tell you

00:08:25.682 --> 00:08:28.132
-- let me think of a good one--

00:08:28.132 --> 00:08:30.330
eight squared,

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:34.947
that equals eight times eight equals sixty-four.

00:08:34.947 --> 00:08:39.442
If I were to tell you twenty-five squared,

00:08:39.442 --> 00:08:46.880
that's twenty-five times twenty-five, which equals six hundred and twenty-five.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.870
Powers of two is always very interesting.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.639
It's especially interesting

00:08:51.639 --> 00:08:53.860
if you one day go into computer science.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:55.496
So two to the fourth power,

00:08:55.496 --> 00:08:59.820
that's two times two times two times two.

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:06.750
So two times two is four so this equals sixteen.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.350
And I did something very interesting here

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.720
kind of on purpose.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:18.210
Notice that two to the fourth is equal to four times four, right?

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:20.370
Because we did four times four here.

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.678
I'm going to detail this more later on,

00:09:22.678 --> 00:09:24.020
but I want to think about what that means.

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:27.070
Because four itself is the same thing as two squared.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.094
So we learned, just real fast,

00:09:29.094 --> 00:09:30.381
two to the fourth is the same thing

00:09:30.381 --> 00:09:34.130
as two squared times two squared.

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:35.742
So I'll let you sit and think about that,

00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:37.727
but other than that I think you have the general idea

00:09:37.727 --> 00:09:40.430
of how basic exponents work,

00:09:40.468 --> 00:09:43.891
and I think you're ready to try the level one exponent module.

00:09:43.891 --> 99:59:59.999
have fun.
