00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.640
my opinion on the legalization of

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:11.650
my opinion on the legalization of
 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.789
my opinion on the legalization of
marijuana is complicated because when we

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:14.799
marijuana is complicated because when we
 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.249
marijuana is complicated because when we
think about a society in general if we

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:17.259
think about a society in general if we
 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:19.260
think about a society in general if we
think about these things honestly every

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270
think about these things honestly every
 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.040
think about these things honestly every
society has their intoxicant we have

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050
society has their intoxicant we have
 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.140
society has their intoxicant we have
alcohol that's our primary when we also

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150
alcohol that's our primary when we also
 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.660
alcohol that's our primary when we also
have tobacco and we have caffeine which

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:27.670
have tobacco and we have caffeine which
 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.259
have tobacco and we have caffeine which
is not as intoxicating now the question

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:31.269
is not as intoxicating now the question
 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:33.920
is not as intoxicating now the question
becomes should we make another

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930
becomes should we make another
 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.630
becomes should we make another
intoxicant legal now we know all the

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640
intoxicant legal now we know all the
 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.700
intoxicant legal now we know all the
problems that we have with those with

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710
problems that we have with those with
 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.549
problems that we have with those with
alcohol tobacco and caffeine we know the

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559
alcohol tobacco and caffeine we know the
 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:43.469
alcohol tobacco and caffeine we know the
problems that we may have so that means

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:43.479
problems that we may have so that means
 

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:45.509
problems that we may have so that means
if you have marijuana be more widely

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519
if you have marijuana be more widely
 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:47.579
if you have marijuana be more widely
available you can also expect to maybe

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:47.589
available you can also expect to maybe
 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:49.890
available you can also expect to maybe
have some more problems some of those

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900
have some more problems some of those
 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.689
have some more problems some of those
similar types of problems on the one

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699
similar types of problems on the one
 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.410
similar types of problems on the one
hand on the other hand in New York City

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420
hand on the other hand in New York City
 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.710
hand on the other hand in New York City
for example we're arresting hundreds of

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720
for example we're arresting hundreds of
 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.869
for example we're arresting hundreds of
thousands of people every year for

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879
thousands of people every year for
 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.890
thousands of people every year for
marijuana and they have they as a result

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900
marijuana and they have they as a result
 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.780
marijuana and they have they as a result
they have a record or they have some

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790
they have a record or they have some
 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.560
they have a record or they have some
sort of blemish and that might retard

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570
sort of blemish and that might retard
 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.100
sort of blemish and that might retard
their ability to make a contribution so

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110
their ability to make a contribution so
 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.620
their ability to make a contribution so
we are also having some consequences

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630
we are also having some consequences
 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.350
we are also having some consequences
from our current legal status of the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360
from our current legal status of the
 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.090
from our current legal status of the
drug so the society has to balance what

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100
drug so the society has to balance what
 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.930
drug so the society has to balance what
is more important to the society but

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940
is more important to the society but
 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.260
is more important to the society but
they should do so with their eyes open

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270
they should do so with their eyes open
 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.810
they should do so with their eyes open
you will have problems either way but

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820
you will have problems either way but
 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.770
you will have problems either way but
the point becomes which problems are we

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780
the point becomes which problems are we
 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.520
the point becomes which problems are we
willing to tolerate as a society on the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530
willing to tolerate as a society on the
 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.350
willing to tolerate as a society on the
one hand now that's the legalization

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360
one hand now that's the legalization
 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.090
one hand now that's the legalization
issue that you're talking about that's a

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100
issue that you're talking about that's a
 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.890
issue that you're talking about that's a
more availability now when we think

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900
more availability now when we think
 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.870
more availability now when we think
about medical marijuana the Institute on

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880
about medical marijuana the Institute on
 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.950
about medical marijuana the Institute on
medicine did a report that tried to

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960
medicine did a report that tried to
 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.170
medicine did a report that tried to
study this issue comprehensively and

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180
study this issue comprehensively and
 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.880
study this issue comprehensively and
suggested that we should probably

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890
suggested that we should probably
 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.060
suggested that we should probably
continue to investigate therapeutic

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070
continue to investigate therapeutic
 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.190
continue to investigate therapeutic
potential to therapeutic potential of

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200
potential to therapeutic potential of
 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.710
potential to therapeutic potential of
marijuana and that's that clearly

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720
marijuana and that's that clearly
 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.529
marijuana and that's that clearly
support that position that we certainly

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539
support that position that we certainly
 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.979
support that position that we certainly
need to if people are suffering and we

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989
need to if people are suffering and we
 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.690
need to if people are suffering and we
have potential medications that will

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700
have potential medications that will
 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.839
have potential medications that will
help relieve their suffering absolutely

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849
help relieve their suffering absolutely
 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.750
help relieve their suffering absolutely
we should go full forth with that and we

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760
we should go full forth with that and we
 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.150
we should go full forth with that and we
should do it in a responsible

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160
should do it in a responsible
 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.940
should do it in a responsible
way in which in a similar way in which

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950
way in which in a similar way in which
 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.890
way in which in a similar way in which
we look at in which we use drugs like

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900
we look at in which we use drugs like
 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.550
we look at in which we use drugs like
morphine which is essentially heroin we

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560
morphine which is essentially heroin we
 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.160
morphine which is essentially heroin we
we do that responsibly

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170
we do that responsibly
 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.200
we do that responsibly
and we certainly do it in a restricted

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210
and we certainly do it in a restricted
 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.850
and we certainly do it in a restricted
and a controlled manner and we should

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860
and a controlled manner and we should
 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.880
and a controlled manner and we should
probably do the same with
