&gt;&gt; WHY, THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME,
LARRY.

00:00:08.407 --> 00:00:08.974 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OKAY.

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:10.576 size:78% position:39% line:85%
YOU ARE WELCOME, BEECHUM.

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:14.647 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO WHY DOESN'T MISSISSIPPI WANT
GAY COUPLES TO ADOPT?

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.951 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; LARRY, MISSISSIPPI ISN'T
ANTI-GAY.

00:00:18.984 --> 00:00:23.356 size:81% position:41% line:85%
IT'S SIMPLY PRO-YESTERDAY.

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:27.660 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: PRO-YESTERDAY?  WHAT
DOES THAT MEAN?

00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:29.162 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; LOOK, LARRY.

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:32.298 align:start position:0% line:91%
MISSISSIPPI IS JUST TRYING TO
REBRAND ITSELF FROM THE

00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:36.436 align:start position:0% line:91%
HOSPITALITY STATE TO THE
NOSTALGIA STATE.

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.172 line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THE NOSTALGIA STATE?

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:42.341 line:91%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT, BECAUSE WE WANT
TO BE THE ONE PLACE IN AMERICA

00:00:42.374 --> 00:00:47.947 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHERE THE GOOD OLD DAYS OF THE
1950'S NEVER ENDED.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:55.888 line:91%
WHERE YOUR BIGGEST CONCERN ISN'T
GLOBAL WARMING OR ISIS, BUT HOW

00:00:55.921 --> 00:01:00.293 line:91%
MANY PENNY COLAS YOU CAN SNEAK
FROM OLD MAN JOHNSON AT THE OLD

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:04.163 align:start position:0% line:91%
FIVE AND DIME, RIGHT?  NOW
DOESN'T THAT SOUND NICE, LARRY?

00:01:04.196 --> 00:01:06.766 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WELL, YEAH.

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.402 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD WHEN YOU
PUT IT LIKE THAT.

00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:11.504 line:91%
BUT WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH BANNING GAY ADOPTION.

00:01:11.537 --> 00:01:14.974 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; CALM DOWN.

00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:18.878 line:91%
NOW, LARRY, IF YOU GO BACK FAR
ENOUGH, GAY DOESN'T EXIST YET.

00:01:18.911 --> 00:01:22.748 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WHAT?

00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:25.017 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; LARRY, THAT IS SIMPLE
SCIENCE.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.651 align:start position:0% line:85%
NOW, LISTEN.

00:01:25.684 --> 00:01:26.552 size:88% position:44% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: IT IS NOT SCIENCE.

00:01:26.585 --> 00:01:28.988 size:81% position:41% line:85%
&gt;&gt; SO WE ARE NOT ANTI-GAY.

00:01:29.021 --> 00:01:33.493 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE ARE SIMPLY PRE-GAY.

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:36.028 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WAIT.

00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:37.497 align:start position:0% line:85%
DID YOU SAY PRE-GAY?

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.831 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT, LARRY.

00:01:38.864 --> 00:01:43.002 align:start position:0% line:91%
AFTER ALL, IT'S ADAM AND EVE NOT
ADAM AND STEVE.

00:01:43.035 --> 00:01:44.137 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OKAY.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.205 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

00:01:45.238 --> 00:01:48.608 align:start position:0% line:91%
LOOK, FIRST OF ALL, GAY PEOPLE
EXISTED IN THE 1950'S.

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:49.442 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHAT ABOUT ROCK HUDSON?

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:51.677 line:85%
&gt;&gt; YOU TAKE THAT BACK, LARRY!

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.247 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WHY?  WHY SHOULD I
TAKE IT BACK.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.549 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT FUTURE
ROCK HUDSON.

00:01:56.582 --> 00:02:00.653 line:91%
NOW HERE IN MISSISSIPPI, ROCK
HUDSON IS STILL A MAN'S MAN.

00:02:00.686 --> 00:02:05.625 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I
WAS SAYING, HE WAS A MAN'S MAN.

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:10.963 align:start position:0% line:91%
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
&gt;&gt; LARRY, DON'T YOU TWIST MY

00:02:10.996 --> 00:02:13.132 align:start position:0% line:91%
WORDS WITH YOUR NORTHERN
TRICKERY.

00:02:13.165 --> 00:02:15.067 line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: IT IS NOT TRICKERY.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.172 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; BESIDES, EVERYBODY KNOWS IT'S
CHRISTMAS EVE, NOT CHRISTMAS

00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:20.306 align:start position:0% line:85%
STEVE.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.276 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: CHRISTMAS STEVE? 
LOOK, THE FIFTIES WERE NOT A

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:25.311 size:75% position:38% line:91%
PERFECT TIME FOR ANYONE,
ESPECIALLY GAY PEOPLE.

00:02:25.344 --> 00:02:28.648 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU DIDN'T SEE THEM BECAUSE THEY
HAD TO STAY IN THE CLOSET.

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:34.520 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; LARRY YOU KNOW WHAT I KEEP IN
MY CLOSET?  A FISHING POLE.

00:02:34.553 --> 00:02:38.491 line:91%
AND WHAT I DO ON A NICE SUMMER
DAY I TAKE IT DOWN TO OLD RAY'S

00:02:38.524 --> 00:02:41.494 align:start position:0% line:91%
CRICK AND I PUT SOME TROUT RIGHT
THERE IN MY WICKER BASKET.

00:02:41.527 --> 00:02:43.262 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHICH REMINDS ME.

00:02:43.295 --> 00:02:46.265 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S BASKET WEAVE, DON'T BASKET
STEVE.

00:02:46.298 --> 00:02:48.167 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT MAKES NO SENSE
AT ALL.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.438 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, LARRY, IT'S
SHREVEPORT, NOT STEVE-PORT.

00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:55.408 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WITH A WHY ARE YOU
O OBSESSED WITH THE NAME STEVE? 

00:02:55.441 --> 00:03:00.313 line:91%
I MEAN YOU CAN'T USE EMPTY
PLATITUDES TO TRY TO DISPROVE

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:04.383 line:91%
MEANINGFUL GAY RELATIONSHIPS AND
DENY THEM BASIC RIGHTS TO HAVE A

00:03:04.416 --> 00:03:05.651 align:start position:0% line:85%
FAMILY.

00:03:05.684 --> 00:03:09.388 line:91%
&gt;&gt; WOW IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE'S
GOT A PET STEVE INSTEAD OF A PET

00:03:09.421 --> 00:03:09.822 align:start position:0% line:85%
PEEVE.

00:03:09.855 --> 00:03:12.158 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OKAY.

00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:13.993 line:85%
&gt;&gt; YOU ARE NOT MAKING ANY SENSE.

00:03:14.026 --> 00:03:16.829 align:start position:0% line:91%
I CAN'T EVEN TALK TO YOU
ANYMORE.

00:03:16.862 --> 00:03:19.632 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YVES ST. LAURENT, NOT STEVE
ST. LAURENT.

00:03:19.665 --> 00:03:22.201 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: BEECHUM, GRADY,
EVERYONE.

00:03:22.234 --> 00:03:24.971 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT'S TEL AVIV, NOT TELL A

00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:27.070 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WE WILL BE RIGHT
BACK!
