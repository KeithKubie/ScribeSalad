00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.930
Hey,
what's going on it's Bill Burr and It's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04.931 --> 00:00:07.180
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:07.181 --> 00:00:11.680
And I am just checking in on you.
That's it.

4
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.890
You might notice my voice is a couple octaves lower.

5
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.380
I've been doing shows all this week.
Um,
and I was sick like a month ago,

6
00:00:20.381 --> 00:00:24.630
so I don't know that it's fucking recovered,
but uh,
I don't have my usual,
uh,

7
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.530
you know,
mid range voice,
but this,

8
00:00:26.531 --> 00:00:30.000
I promise you this is me

9
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.120
anyways.
Um,

10
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.290
I'm up here in San Francisco with the North's theater with a Nate Kraig.

11
00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:41.560
We've been having a great time all week.
Um,
last night,
you know,

12
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.060
it was one of those nights,
she had a great show.

13
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.440
It was like I didn't want to fucking go home,
so we ended up going over to a,

14
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.080
was just walking around and ended up just at the Fillmore.

15
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.550
So we walk,
oh,
it goes to go fucking go over there,
have a drink or something.

16
00:00:56.551 --> 00:00:58.890
Right,
because Billy's off the wagon again.
Right.

17
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.870
I guess when I get home I'll get back on the fucking wagon.
I'm the worst.

18
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.710
I'm either on or I'm off and I'm off.
Yeah,
baby.

19
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.420
Sorry.
Um,
by the way,

20
00:01:12.421 --> 00:01:17.010
if you want to see arguably some of the funniest shit on the Internet.

21
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.581
Nay.

22
00:01:17.581 --> 00:01:21.930
Craig told me about Kyle done against a Instagram page and I guess Joe Rogan and

23
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.940
Thompson Gora.
Those guys have all hyped it.
I,

24
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.290
I've been completely out of the loop.

25
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.660
That guy's one of the funniest fucking comedians.

26
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.700
I've always been a huge fan of his stuff and um,

27
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.190
and I thought he was so fucking original,
but I,
his Instagram page,

28
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.740
I can't even describe how,

29
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.980
how fucking hilarious I was the like every morning for like the last three days

30
00:01:43.981 --> 00:01:46.380
I've been watching all of his videos for like an hour,

31
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.630
just laying in bed crying,
laughing.
Um,

32
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.760
his Instagram is at Kyle Dunnigan,

33
00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.060
I g.
A n hope is spelt that right and the number one.

34
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.880
And he does like that face swap thing and he does this fucking ridiculous

35
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.050
impression of everybody.
Bill Maher,

36
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.260
Donald Trump,
uh,
Caitlyn Jenner,

37
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.080
all the Kardashians.
Um,

38
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.770
just everything that he does it fuck is bill Maher's.
Ridiculous.

39
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.980
And then he got like all these different Trump's,
he's got tiny Trump,

40
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.210
trans Trump,
just Trump in general.
Um,

41
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.030
it's fucking unbelievable.
Um,
so check that out.

42
00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:40.740
So anyways,
um,
we ended up going,
walking over to the,

43
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.850
uh,
we ended up over at the Fillmore,
so we go to walk in,
you know,

44
00:02:44.851 --> 00:02:47.010
and there's a band playing.
So of course the security like,
hey,

45
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.150
<v 1>whoa,
whoa,
Whoa,
whoa,
whoa,
hey,
whoa.</v>

46
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.610
<v 0>We like,
yeah,
hey,
we're just going in there to get a drink.
And the guy goes,</v>

47
00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.470
uh,
you can't,
it's a show going on.
This is a concert venue.
You know,

48
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.880
I taped a special,
there was kind of funny.
I said,
yeah,
I know.
I gotta go.

49
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:07.960
I've performed here because,
oh,
you've performed here.
I've never done this.

50
00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:11.440
I just said,
yeah,
I'm a comedian.
I just want to go on and have a drink.

51
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.970
And then fortunately,
he recognized me and I was able to pull that fucking card.

52
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.590
I never pulled a car.
It's pretty cool.

53
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.150
So then I went upstairs and I just hear this fucking woman's voice.

54
00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.520
You just incredible playing the guitar.
Incredible.

55
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.520
And I poked my head into the seat and you know those big tour buses,
Shit.

56
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.130
But there wasn't a band on stage.
It was just,
you know,

57
00:03:36.131 --> 00:03:40.420
you know when the one person's up there and their play into a loop and then they

58
00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:43.450
loop it with something else,
the Pr,
you know,
she was doing that shit.
I was like,

59
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.400
aw man,
I missed seeing bands.

60
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.200
I get it all the fucking crowd stole the music and the fucking labels do the

61
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.490
cross the board

62
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.110
fucking deals where they even take a piece of your merge,
you know,

63
00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:59.410
the greedy [inaudible] so I get it.
So it was just like,
yeah.

64
00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:02.380
So it's kind of bumped out even though her voice was fucking incredible.

65
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.641
It's just like,

66
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:07.300
I like watching a live band cause I like when I want to bands like improvising

67
00:04:07.301 --> 00:04:08.134
and shit.

68
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.420
I always love watching like Stevie Ray Vaughan cause she'd see Tommy and uh,

69
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.780
Chris Layton,
well never stopped looking at them cause they're like,
all right,

70
00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:17.351
what's he doing?

71
00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:20.080
Is he going to go around again or is he going to fucking go into the verse?

72
00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:20.830
You know,
when,
you know,

73
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.190
when it start to come to the point where he would come out of the Solo,

74
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.140
is he going to keep soloing?
What is he going to do?

75
00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:28.660
And when you just see that and then you see Stevie just give them like this

76
00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:33.520
fucking little nod is he's wailing on the guitar and then they just seamlessly

77
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.460
in that moment know that,
that go into this next set.
That's what I fucking love.

78
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.150
Um,
so it's just one person up there.
It's,
you know,
but you here in a band,
I get,

79
00:04:46.151 --> 00:04:49.390
you know,
I'm a fucking old guy on man.
Where's the rest of the people?
Right.

80
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.870
So I walked into the other Roman,
I was sitting there with Nate,
you know,

81
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.290
and I'm just listening to this woman singing.
I'm like,
oh my God,

82
00:04:56.291 --> 00:04:58.440
she's fucking unreal.
I'm here a little Amy Winehouse.

83
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.750
So just using incredible and uh,

84
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.170
I had a drink or something and I go,
man,
that's,
I swear to God,

85
00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:06.310
that sounds like a band.

86
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.960
And then I walked back out there and now there's a whole band on stage and I'm

87
00:05:10.961 --> 00:05:12.640
like,
where the fuck did that woman go?

88
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.670
Was she opening like what the fuck was going on?
Long Story Short,

89
00:05:17.671 --> 00:05:22.671
I find out it wasn't a woman who was a guy and his name is Alan Stone and that

90
00:05:24.811 --> 00:05:27.690
was one of the fucking best voices I've ever heard in my life.

91
00:05:27.691 --> 00:05:31.740
Incredible Guitar player.
Let me see the name of the band.
Um,

92
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.290
it was funny,
we went in,
there was like a,

93
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.350
like all these hardcore fans of this band is called Andrew Andrew McMahon in the

94
00:05:40.351 --> 00:05:41.184
wilderness.

95
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.350
Now granted this isn't like my necessarily my style of music that I would listen

96
00:05:46.351 --> 00:05:50.370
to,
but like how well these people sang was just,

97
00:05:50.371 --> 00:05:51.840
it was fucking incredible.

98
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.950
The Piano player was cracking me up because he was dressed like Kenny Loggins

99
00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.330
and like the early eighties,
I like if you looked at the guy,

100
00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:03.390
like that guy is going to have a major cocaine problem.
Yeah.

101
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.470
Like the Kenny Loggins beard.

102
00:06:06.471 --> 00:06:10.430
And then he had the sweater tied around his neck.
Um,

103
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.820
like when I came up in the 80s,

104
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:18.380
anytime they were going to have like an asshole in a fucking coming of age movie

105
00:06:18.381 --> 00:06:20.980
in the 80s,
they always had the sweater tied around him,
you know,

106
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.880
if the fucking frat boy or whatever.
But anyways,

107
00:06:22.881 --> 00:06:27.590
but it was a completely different vibe.
And afterwards,

108
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:31.250
all these nerdy chicks for going out and talking to,
I look at my face,

109
00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:34.340
can you tell I was crying.
They were crying.
There was definitely,

110
00:06:34.341 --> 00:06:35.780
I don't know what was going on,

111
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.030
but it was definitely sort of the crowd was those,
you know,

112
00:06:41.031 --> 00:06:44.390
the kids who can't throw a ball,
you know,

113
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.430
and aren't good at fighting.
It was that group of people.
Um,

114
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.950
and they will fucking end to this band.
And this band was fucking amazing.

115
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:56.270
Fucking amazing.

116
00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.830
But what was hilarious was the bartenders were all bored as shit because none of

117
00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:01.664
them were drinking.

118
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:09.340
The Fillmore has this really long bar that goes all the way down the left side.

119
00:07:09.381 --> 00:07:14.381
And these fucking bartenders would just leaning with their backs against,

120
00:07:15.171 --> 00:07:16.580
you know,
where the cash registers.

121
00:07:16.581 --> 00:07:18.240
That shit where with this looks on their faces,

122
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:23.150
like how the fuck did I get this shift?
Not gonna make any fucking money tonight.

123
00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:24.330
But anyways,
um,

124
00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:29.400
if you get a chance to see them live,
uh,

125
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.520
or ever get a chance to see that Alan Stone,

126
00:07:31.521 --> 00:07:35.270
I just was looking him up and he was singing with a Daryl hall and stuff.

127
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.140
Evidently the guys is like fucking legendary.
And I'm going like,

128
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.600
who is this chick?
Why?
Where's the rest of the band?

129
00:07:41.601 --> 00:07:44.210
And I just walk in the other room.
So fucking stupid.

130
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.790
But I'm glad that I was able to,
uh,

131
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.600
cause I was talking with people afterwards when they leave and I go,
Whoa,

132
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.020
where was that woman?
And they will laugh and go on.

133
00:07:54.021 --> 00:07:58.310
That wasn't a woman that was a guy that was a guy.
Thanks.

134
00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.940
Allen's down.
God.
Um,
anyways,
uh,

135
00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:07.130
so I went up when I saw that there was a whole bad,
like I've,
you know,

136
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:10.600
I've only been in the film or a couple times and um,

137
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:13.310
when you're upstairs you get,
you know,

138
00:08:13.311 --> 00:08:17.260
unless you have like the two old guys in the muppet show seats in those things,

139
00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.900
it's very hard to see the band.
But then this is one area where it's straight on.

140
00:08:20.901 --> 00:08:25.850
So upstairs,
so I walk and there was this woman's security sit down.

141
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.190
I go,
is it okay to walk over there?

142
00:08:28.191 --> 00:08:31.310
And she goes through that section is private

143
00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:36.560
and I want it to be like,
I only asked you once,

144
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:41.510
you fucking cunt.
I don't know if she was yelling over the music,

145
00:08:41.511 --> 00:08:42.321
but I was just like,

146
00:08:42.321 --> 00:08:45.860
what the f I felt like I was on like a seven year relationship with there and

147
00:08:45.861 --> 00:08:49.640
whatever the fuck it is that I,
I do that bugs her.
I just did it.

148
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:55.330
That section has private,
ugh.

149
00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:58.710
You know what I thought about,

150
00:08:58.711 --> 00:09:02.160
you know who is that guy used to climb in to the ring like a spider.

151
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:07.160
The Guy who kicked the guy and broke his leg in half.
Um,
Anderson Silva.

152
00:09:07.161 --> 00:09:09.900
I remember that front kick he would do and you just didn't see it coming,

153
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.830
you know,
that went into my head when she leaned forward.

154
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:18.150
Private just give you the old right there Fred.
You know,

155
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.030
and I would do that as an empowering move to a woman.
You know,

156
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:25.860
treating her as an equal like,
well that's what you would do to a guy.
Right.

157
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:31.500
How come women don't want that part of equal rights?
It's all right.

158
00:09:31.501 --> 00:09:33.900
You want to make what we make them.
You know,

159
00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.690
you gotta take a mid to the face every once in awhile.

160
00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:45.220
By the way,
I have been such an asshole on stage this week.

161
00:09:45.221 --> 00:09:49.660
I've been having such a good time.
I said some of the most ridiculous shit.
Um,

162
00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:54.610
I don't know that I've said,
I don't think ever.
I've just been like,

163
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.990
it's a total reaction to like what the f all this fucking crap out there.

164
00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:03.100
You know,
I did this interview recently and I was talking to this guy.

165
00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.760
I'll probably get in trouble for this shit.
I came here,

166
00:10:04.761 --> 00:10:06.400
what the fuck are you talking about with the guy goes,
yeah,

167
00:10:06.401 --> 00:10:10.270
but you can't say they can't see.
It's like,
what the fuck are you?
I yes,
I can.

168
00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.360
You can't say why.

169
00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:17.740
Why did people all of a sudden won't know they're jokes and then then there'll

170
00:10:17.741 --> 00:10:21.580
be,
yeah,
what's going on?
What the fuck is going to happen?
Um,

171
00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:26.560
so anyways,
I been up here all this week and um,

172
00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:31.690
I got this thing in my write up,
but if I spend more than one night someplace,

173
00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:35.290
they'll bring in some old drum kit or whatever and I just play on it during the

174
00:10:35.291 --> 00:10:37.660
day.
So,
uh,

175
00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:41.910
I'm up here and I don't know that one of the guys who,
uh,

176
00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:46.330
works at the theater is a drummer.
They get me these sick fucking DW kit.

177
00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:48.310
That sounds amazing.

178
00:10:48.311 --> 00:10:52.960
I brought my double pedal up and I brought my fucking that all that music that I

179
00:10:52.961 --> 00:10:57.250
wrote out on that a Metallica song you spent having like the best fucking time

180
00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.340
ever,
although I'm missing my wife and my kid big time.

181
00:11:00.341 --> 00:11:04.000
But this really is a,
an amazing city.

182
00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:07.290
And I had a friend of mine come out last night,
uh,

183
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:10.420
where I hadn't seen in awhile and I kind of learned some shit though.

184
00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:14.630
I was glad that we hung out there rather than over at the punchline because I

185
00:11:14.631 --> 00:11:18.910
really like how my brain works as far as when I get depressed is when I tried to

186
00:11:18.911 --> 00:11:21.460
go into the past.
You know,

187
00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:25.690
like if you go into a place that you haven't been in a long time,

188
00:11:25.691 --> 00:11:29.110
like you're all excited and then you walk in there and like,
nobody that,

189
00:11:29.111 --> 00:11:33.820
you know,
you don't know anybody anymore and you're like that,
ah,
fuck,

190
00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:38.470
I'm old.
The time came and it went,
why didn't I enjoy it more?

191
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:43.660
You know?
So I was glad I met her over there.
But uh,

192
00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:48.040
you know,
she just was one of the people,

193
00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:51.370
I don't know that it should have been a person like her and every comedy town

194
00:11:51.371 --> 00:11:55.660
because she fucking her tastes and comedians and how much she gave,

195
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:57.550
there's still gives a shit about comedy is,

196
00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:02.050
I think one of the major reasons why the standup scene here has always been so

197
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:07.300
freaking strong.
So anyways,
let's,
uh,
let's plow ahead.

198
00:12:07.301 --> 00:12:12.100
I went to the giants game yesterday.
The,
uh,
the baseball giants,

199
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:17.770
uh,
they had a day game fucking started at like one o'clock and I'm,

200
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:20.950
Nate was giving me all this shit because I was keeping score.

201
00:12:20.951 --> 00:12:24.700
When I go to baseball games,
I like to keep score cause if,
if I don't,

202
00:12:24.701 --> 00:12:29.410
I don't know what the fuck is going on.
You know,
there's literally 18 people,

203
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.080
you know,
you don't know how many who's given up hits in the eye,
yellowy,

204
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.960
make a pitching change and you don't even hear it.

205
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:38.620
Cause there's so much fucking shit going on.
You know,

206
00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:42.940
at the giants they have this woman doing the fucking announcements and like

207
00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:47.380
their voice just,
it just doesn't carry like,
I don't know what it is.

208
00:12:47.381 --> 00:12:52.150
Like you need the base to cut through.
He's eyeing Aviat a man he has.

209
00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.730
Yes,
he has yet.
I'm like,
what the fuck did she say?

210
00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:57.550
Then I have to look at the number and then I gotta look it up on my phone.

211
00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:01.870
It's like you just announced it over a PA system.
How the fuck did I not hear it?

212
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.570
Um,
I played drums.
Maybe my ears are fucked up.
I Dunno.
I Dunno what,
but um,

213
00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:13.510
I got a $12 cores at that fucking ballpark.

214
00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:16.210
And what's funny is when you get the scorecard,

215
00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:19.810
the scorecard is a dollar and then they make you pay for the pencil.

216
00:13:19.811 --> 00:13:21.070
Now the pencils,
a buck,

217
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:24.880
it's like the cheapest thing in the park and got a bag of peanuts and had an ice

218
00:13:24.881 --> 00:13:28.110
cold beer.
I sat there keeping schools fucking great.

219
00:13:28.111 --> 00:13:31.150
Only thing I was missing was a cigar would have been perfect.

220
00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.070
And I'm this fucking Guy Suarez.

221
00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.810
Got Sheldon the first dating and then he settled down.

222
00:13:37.811 --> 00:13:40.510
But the giants were never able to catch up.
It was,
you know,
it's a good game.

223
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:46.120
Stephanie.
Good game,
beautiful ballpark.
The reds got some guy on the,
on their uh,

224
00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:51.880
their team,
little fella and he goes by scooter.
So like I'd be like,

225
00:13:51.881 --> 00:13:53.920
you know,
at some point you've got to call me by my name,

226
00:13:53.921 --> 00:13:56.500
but he still goes by scooter.
Right?
So we're sitting there going like,

227
00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:58.960
Nate's going,
how tall do you think that guy is?
I'm like,

228
00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:01.030
that guy might be a couple inches shorter than me.

229
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:07.350
And then he steps up to the plate and just fucking crushes one crushes one all

230
00:14:09.701 --> 00:14:14.140
the way out to the fucking,
I call it the ocean.
We're Covey's bay cove.
Sorry,

231
00:14:14.141 --> 00:14:16.870
I'm a Covey's cove.
Whatever the fuck it is.
Um,

232
00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:20.470
I think that's why he still goes by scooter,

233
00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:25.380
cause that's got a really fuck with the other PR,
the pitchers,
you know,

234
00:14:25.381 --> 00:14:28.740
confidence and you just step up to the plate.
You name's Mike and you go yard.

235
00:14:28.741 --> 00:14:32.970
He's not going to give a fuck with some guy named scooter hits the ball into the

236
00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.510
fuck.
You know,
your best pitch into the fucking ocean.
That's,
you know,

237
00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:41.040
you've gotta be,
you've gotta take a lap around the mountain going like,

238
00:14:41.041 --> 00:14:41.960
is this the end of my career?

239
00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:45.210
Some fucking make a wish kid just came up and just fucking crushed into the

240
00:14:45.211 --> 00:14:48.240
ocean.
Um,
anyways,

241
00:14:48.241 --> 00:14:52.850
how bout those Boston Celtics,
once again,

242
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:54.620
I'll work in every fucking night.
This week,

243
00:14:54.621 --> 00:14:57.290
I've missed every second of the last series in this series.

244
00:14:57.291 --> 00:15:01.910
I just keep watching the highlights and um,
and defense,

245
00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:05.900
the Cavaliers,
uhh,
I guess they have the worst team defense in the league.

246
00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:10.280
Um,
but you know,
Brad Stevens I guess is out coaching them and all that stuff.

247
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:12.050
But,
uh,
I gotta be honest with you,

248
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:17.650
I really won't feel comfortable that we're going to beat the cavs until we win

249
00:15:18.021 --> 00:15:22.190
the fourth game.
Cause if the Cavs went tonight,

250
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:26.120
I'm assuming the plane tonight that all of a sudden it's two one and he just

251
00:15:26.121 --> 00:15:29.360
gets scary again.
Like,
Oh fuck,
here comes the Lebron he had comes Lebron.

252
00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:32.660
And when you're talking about a guy who has led his teams to the finals,

253
00:15:32.661 --> 00:15:35.930
how many years in a row,
and I don't give a fuck that he was on a pile on team.

254
00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:39.590
Coby was on a pile on team his entire fucking career and he didn't go to the

255
00:15:39.591 --> 00:15:43.310
finals fucking,
you know,
seven years in a row,
whatever the hell

256
00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:45.300
<v 3>yeah,</v>

257
00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:50.130
<v 0>Lebron is working on right now.
So,
uh,
we shall see this is all,</v>

258
00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.210
you know,
it's all gravy.

259
00:15:53.211 --> 00:15:55.370
But they just keep putting it in the fucking rocket speed.

260
00:15:55.371 --> 00:15:59.780
The goddamn warriors last night,
I guess,
which is incredible.

261
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.600
Um,
you just can't root for the warriors.
Once Duran went to the warriors,

262
00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:08.000
you just can't fucking,
it's the stupidest,
it's so fucking stupid.

263
00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.830
It makes the Miami Heat not look like a pile on team.
I am.

264
00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:18.150
Maybe he was a pilot.
I,
but I'm just saying,
you know what I mean?
Oh,
Z NBA was so,

265
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:21.400
I know I've said this a thousand times,
but the NBA was so fucking great,

266
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.460
that warriors thunder series.

267
00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:28.990
We're thunder when up three games to one and then they fucked it up because they

268
00:16:28.991 --> 00:16:30.760
were too young.
They didn't know how to win.

269
00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:34.120
And the warriors showed the championship part that they had.

270
00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.550
And then that was the story.
The next year

271
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:40.390
was where the thunder going to fucking get over the hump,

272
00:16:40.391 --> 00:16:43.600
where they going to dig down deep and,
and,

273
00:16:43.601 --> 00:16:46.690
and slay the fucking dragon.
And what happens

274
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.010
Luke Skywalker?
It goes,
you know what?
You are my father.

275
00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:56.390
I'll fucking join the dark side and fucking Kevin Duran just goes over there.

276
00:16:56.391 --> 00:17:00.650
And the second he went over there,
everybody who watches NBA hoop goes,
oh,

277
00:17:00.651 --> 00:17:03.140
the warriors are going to win the championship.
And then they did.

278
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:07.470
It was fucking boring as shit.
Um,

279
00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:09.180
the only thing I like about it

280
00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:15.540
is that Duran didn't go to the Lakers and I have to watch them,

281
00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:19.860
you know,
once again,
free agent their way to yet another fucking championship,

282
00:17:19.861 --> 00:17:23.340
which admittedly is a Celtics fan.
We did in 2008 but the fucking,

283
00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:25.883
you know,

284
00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:30.240
I've watched the Lakers get five championships in the last like 20 years doing

285
00:17:30.241 --> 00:17:34.800
shit like that and it's just,
you know,
gets fucking tired after a while,
you know,

286
00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:38.220
um,
especially because,
you know,
according to them,

287
00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:40.170
their one championship behind us,
which,
you know,

288
00:17:40.171 --> 00:17:43.200
we all know through Bill Simmons Book Than Not that too.

289
00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:47.190
And we also know that it was a mobbed up fucking ref that fixed that Sacramento

290
00:17:47.191 --> 00:17:50.570
series.
So they got fucking two banners,
you know.
But uh,

291
00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:55.290
what I do like about it is that's very la to pad your resume,
you know,

292
00:17:55.710 --> 00:18:00.540
to make Instagram videos and then call yourself a director.
Um,
anyways,

293
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:06.120
so I am a,
I dunno,

294
00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.100
we'll see what happens.
I wish I could just watch one of these fucking games.

295
00:18:09.101 --> 00:18:13.400
If we get by the Cavaliers
and the war is,
you know,

296
00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:15.080
of course they're going to go to the fucking finals.

297
00:18:15.081 --> 00:18:17.570
How are they not going to want a championship when you have like every fucking

298
00:18:17.571 --> 00:18:21.140
good guy in the league is on your Goddamn team.
Um,

299
00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:25.720
I mean,
I dunno,

300
00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:29.130
the Celtics actually could win one or two games against the fucking warriors.

301
00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.650
I'm them.
I'm not looking ahead here.
I mean,
that'd be what I'm really on there.

302
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:36.040
We got Kyrie Irving free agent guy right there.
Bill fucking hypocrite.

303
00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:40.700
Um,
yeah,
but we're upstart too.
Those are all fun.

304
00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:43.540
Get off fucking everybody adds one free fucking agent,
right?

305
00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:46.330
That's all I'm saying.
It was just,
it was just bad.
I just don't understand why,

306
00:18:46.331 --> 00:18:47.560
you know,
I fucking hate the Lakers,

307
00:18:47.561 --> 00:18:50.590
but I don't understand why that one guy couldn't go to the fucking Lakers.

308
00:18:50.591 --> 00:18:55.340
But Kevin Durant could go to the fucking gold stay away.

309
00:18:55.341 --> 00:18:57.880
Did you kill you?
Kill the whole fucking story.

310
00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:04.380
It'd be like if when the Celtics beat the Lakers in 84 if magic said fuck it,

311
00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:05.810
he just joined the Celtics.

312
00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:14.400
I Dunno,
whatever.
I'm an old guy.
The Celtic signed free agents too,

313
00:19:14.401 --> 00:19:18.510
but let me,
I,
I would,
I would think if we went to make a move like that,

314
00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:22.740
um,
someone was actually saying that,
you know,

315
00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:27.570
Duran or somebody is up for free agency and he might go to the Celtics and I was

316
00:19:27.571 --> 00:19:29.220
thinking,
I don't fucking want that guy.

317
00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:30.600
I don't want to be become part of the problem.

318
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:35.710
You're just going to bounce around the league.
No

319
00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:40.070
picking up rings on it,
you know?

320
00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.550
And this is from a guy who barely watches the NBA.
Why am I this subset?

321
00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:48.200
I'll tell you why I'm the subset now that I asked the question for you guys,

322
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:51.260
now I'm going to answer it.
I just remember when I was at,
when you were,

323
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:55.850
when you were a fucking kid and you had outdoor recess and you would choose an

324
00:19:55.851 --> 00:20:00.020
up teams even as little kids,
if it got too lopsided,
you'd be like,

325
00:20:00.021 --> 00:20:01.490
oh wait a minute,
wait a minute.
Wait,
wait,
wait.

326
00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.640
He didn't even it out because even then you knew like where would the

327
00:20:04.641 --> 00:20:09.280
satisfaction be in winning
kids know,

328
00:20:09.281 --> 00:20:11.230
kids know not to do what the fuck they're doing.

329
00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:16.180
But I mean that is the way it's done now.
I mean,
free agency give,

330
00:20:16.181 --> 00:20:21.070
I should just accept the fact,
okay,
here's,
okay,
here's the deal.

331
00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:25.390
I accept the fact that this free agents,
okay.
And I admit the Celtics,
you know,

332
00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:30.560
we bought a championship in 2008 and uh,
you know,

333
00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:33.410
and we also added Kyrie Irving this year,
but you know,
maybe,
you know,

334
00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:34.803
<v 2>okay.</v>

335
00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.850
<v 0>And Lebron could get along a little better.
I mean,
I don't,
I don't fucking know,</v>

336
00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:38.713
but

337
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:40.000
<v 2>yeah,</v>

338
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.610
<v 0>they asked it should,
that should be aligned,
you know,</v>

339
00:20:43.611 --> 00:20:47.860
that that Miami heat things shouldn't have fucking happened.
The,
the,
the uh,

340
00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:49.070
what's his face trade?

341
00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.780
Kevin Garnett with Kevin Mchale on the front office,

342
00:20:53.781 --> 00:20:58.280
gives his old team Kevin Garnett for nothing that should have been blocked,

343
00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:01.820
would pog saw with Jerry West and the front office went to Lakers.

344
00:21:01.821 --> 00:21:05.540
That should have been blocked.
Just shit like that.
That's all I'm saying.
C.

345
00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:07.310
So I took a little burden out there,
you know,

346
00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:11.570
maybe I don't fucking know any who gives a fuck.
Um,

347
00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:18.080
so anyways,
uh,
what do I got here?

348
00:21:18.081 --> 00:21:21.890
I got two more goddamn show.
You have no reads.
I have no reeds here on Thursday.

349
00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:27.140
And I'm trying desperately not to do my impression of countdown against Donald

350
00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:31.520
Trump or fucking bill Maher to his bill Maher is so fucking ridiculously on.

351
00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:37.920
Have you ever seen the one he does?
Um,
where are you?

352
00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.210
She has like Bill Maher reading to children.

353
00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.260
He's stringing reading like nursery rhymes.
He's like,
hey dude,

354
00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:50.460
I'll doodle the cat and the fiddle.
Okay.
The cow jumped over the moon.

355
00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:54.790
Really over the moon.
This story is bullshit.

356
00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:58.150
And he just like makes the kids cry.
I know I'm doing a shit version.

357
00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:02.940
You got to hear the guy stop listening my podcast and go hear some real comedy

358
00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:07.470
at,
at Kyle Dunnigan.
One.
The guy's a fucking genius.

359
00:22:07.471 --> 00:22:11.070
I don't get how that guy is not on Saturday night life.
I just don't.

360
00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:13.250
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

361
00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:16.880
<v 0>you know,
I,
I bet you know why?
Cause they wouldn't do the Caitlyn Jenner Shit.</v>

362
00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:21.110
I Dunno what happened.
They,
they're all fucking political over there now.

363
00:22:21.111 --> 00:22:24.770
That used to be rebellious,
you know,

364
00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:29.140
you got to see is Kaitlyn Janice.
Shit baby Trump.
All right,
I'm done hyping it.

365
00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:32.510
I don't want to fucking overhype I can over hype but it's fucking hilarious.

366
00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:35.240
Alright,
plowing ahead here.
Um,

367
00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:39.650
so I got,
what's the night Thursday?

368
00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.650
I've got two more shows up here and then that's the end.
Um,

369
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:45.680
I'm going to be just doing a bunch of sets around La,

370
00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:49.480
get ready for 'em my,

371
00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:51.260
my big shows there in uh,

372
00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:56.390
in Europe and then my big birthday turning 50 next fucking month.

373
00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:01.700
You know,
I don't feel any different.
My shoulders fucking great.

374
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:06.380
Here's the deal.
Every year on my birthday I got to do like,
uh,

375
00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:09.920
the amount of pushups for whatever year I am and I haven't done them

376
00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:13.430
the last couple of years cause my shoulders but fucked up.

377
00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:18.950
So I think the last time I did was I turned 47.
So,

378
00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:21.620
uh,
I'm up to doing sets of 35,

379
00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.410
so I'm right on right on pace here.

380
00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:28.070
And maybe then turning 50 won't be as devastating.

381
00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:33.200
But I did 50 pushups.
Does that make me a mortal?

382
00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:37.580
Um,
anyways,
you know what?

383
00:23:37.581 --> 00:23:40.340
I think we'll have the podcast is going to be a little short.
I mean,

384
00:23:40.341 --> 00:23:42.170
I don't think I have anything else to talk about me.

385
00:23:42.171 --> 00:23:44.810
How the fuck am I going to fill up these?
I feel,
I don't even know why.

386
00:23:44.811 --> 00:23:47.420
I mean self employed.
Why do,
why do I feel,

387
00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.020
what am I going to fire myself if I know to a full half hour?

388
00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:53.030
Is that what it's going to be at?
You know,

389
00:23:53.031 --> 00:23:55.040
the Red Sox are actually playing the Oakland A's.

390
00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:57.590
I was thinking of going over there like an asshole.

391
00:23:57.591 --> 00:24:02.540
You know what I did here in the San Francisco is joking.
I did the impossible.

392
00:24:02.541 --> 00:24:07.430
I actually got a fucking sunburned in San Francisco like the sun was out,

393
00:24:07.431 --> 00:24:12.080
but I was just like,
it's San Francisco.
It's always cold and shitty here.
Um,

394
00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:18.290
they just have miserable fucking weather.
Um,
that,
you know,

395
00:24:18.291 --> 00:24:21.350
they have the great white shark fucking weather.
Right?
The water's freezing.

396
00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:26.120
No one ever made it off the rock man.
Right.
It's just always like that.
In fact,

397
00:24:26.121 --> 00:24:30.480
I used to always come here and every time I would come here I'd get sick.
Um,

398
00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:32.570
I dunno why it was like the flight from new,

399
00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:36.320
I was living in New York and every time I'd come out to do the punchline I would

400
00:24:36.321 --> 00:24:41.210
get sick because a I way I wasn't taking care of myself than I had that extra

401
00:24:41.211 --> 00:24:44.930
long flight.
And then I would step off into this just cold,
damp,

402
00:24:44.931 --> 00:24:49.580
fucking awful weather.
And like three times in a row when I came here,
I got sick.

403
00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:54.110
And um,
Molly at the punchline,
I remember the last time I came out there,

404
00:24:54.111 --> 00:24:55.730
she sent me like fucking

405
00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:00.560
sent me all these vitamins c packages,

406
00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:03.260
which is fucking drinking a zillion of them before he got out there.

407
00:25:03.261 --> 00:25:06.890
So I would get sick.
I starting to think I was allergic to this town.

408
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:08.720
So when I uh,
looked,
you know,

409
00:25:08.721 --> 00:25:12.620
I looked up the fucking weather coming up here as I was waiting for it to pop
up.

410
00:25:12.621 --> 00:25:14.210
I just said cold and shitty.

411
00:25:14.211 --> 00:25:18.920
And I looked at it and it was everyday there was clouds with a little bit of
Sun.

412
00:25:18.921 --> 00:25:23.210
And then rain and I don't know what happened.
Something changed.
So yesterday we,

413
00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:28.160
uh,
we walked over to the ballpark and
I'm like,
God,

414
00:25:28.161 --> 00:25:30.050
this is going to burn off.
This is going to burn off.

415
00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:33.250
A bought a couple of really good seats.
And uh,

416
00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:37.640
I was just sitting in the sun the whole fucking time wearing a north face
jacket,

417
00:25:37.641 --> 00:25:39.920
sweating my ass off.
But I was like,

418
00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.890
well I can't take this off cause I got on short sleeves underneath that I'm

419
00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:44.060
going to fucking burn up.

420
00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:49.450
So I sat there and a winter coat and like 75 degree weather keeping score.

421
00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:52.850
I looked like a fucking,
you know,

422
00:25:52.851 --> 00:25:56.390
the only thing I was missing was those giant headphones with like the am radio

423
00:25:56.391 --> 00:26:00.740
antenna sticking out of it.
Um,
those are the fucking lunatics though.

424
00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.580
Like I wasn't that bad of a nerd.
You know,

425
00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:08.570
those guys who actually listened to the ballgame while they're watching it and

426
00:26:08.571 --> 00:26:12.890
they're keeping score.
Um,
but I'll tell you,
they know everything that's going on.

427
00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:15.200
They know when they make a pitching change,

428
00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:17.570
when there's a pinch hitter and all of that shit,

429
00:26:17.571 --> 00:26:20.210
like trying to keep score like when you're out in the outfield.

430
00:26:20.211 --> 00:26:23.960
The only way I was able to do it cause I was uh,
and um,

431
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:27.710
right behind home plate.
So when somebody came up on on deck,

432
00:26:27.711 --> 00:26:31.910
I would just check the number to make sure they didn't switch somebody out.
Um,

433
00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:36.110
and that's my exciting story about keeping score.

434
00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:39.850
All right,
I'm finished.
I'm starving.
I'm going to go.

435
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:41.810
I've been eating good even though I've been drinking again,

436
00:26:41.811 --> 00:26:45.600
which I don't fucking like,
but I just get,
I get fucking bored when I'm out here.

437
00:26:45.601 --> 00:26:47.670
What am I going to do?
You don't want to fuck me up.

438
00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:50.310
Was I brought my reset a stone up here.

439
00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:53.940
I brought the little external fucking distinct that you stick it in.

440
00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:56.880
I plug it in and I left the fucking desk at home.

441
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.870
So now what am I supposed to do?
Am I supposed to get some food coloring book?

442
00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:09.900
My show is at seven every night.
I'm done by nine.
I'm all wound up.

443
00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:15.940
You know,
I've seen more goddamn couples arguing in public up here.

444
00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:19.700
The city is more expensive,
I guess,

445
00:27:19.701 --> 00:27:23.540
than even New York City for rent or to buy something.

446
00:27:23.541 --> 00:27:28.310
And you can really see the stress on the people just screaming at each other.

447
00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:30.830
So that three times yesterday,

448
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:34.950
and I'll tell you the woman was winning all three

449
00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:41.060
and each one of the relationships,
I was like,
she's a lot smarter than that guy.

450
00:27:41.061 --> 00:27:43.040
Why is she with this person?
Okay.

451
00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.560
Cause like the guy was like trying to come back,
you know?

452
00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:49.620
Oh the rocky Balboa.

453
00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.450
<v 5>What about you?
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.</v>

454
00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:56.790
<v 0>And the woman would just rattling off all the things that this guy was fucking</v>

455
00:27:56.791 --> 00:28:01.690
up.
And granted I was just walking by,
you know,
by experience,

456
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:03.510
their relationship for five seconds.

457
00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:08.670
And my immediate thought other than these two people need to break up was uh,

458
00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:12.120
you know,
she,
she's got you there buddy.
She's making a lot of good points.

459
00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:16.213
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

460
00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:17.750
<v 0>And I,</v>

461
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:22.750
but joking about this on stage to San Francisco has the most homeless homeless

462
00:28:24.331 --> 00:28:25.890
people I've ever seen in my life.

463
00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:28.260
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

464
00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:33.210
<v 0>It's almost like they're not real.
They're so fucking homeless,
this skid row,</v>

465
00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:35.580
it's just fucking,
it's unbelievable.

466
00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:41.620
We walked by this woman,
she was literally passed out in her hand,

467
00:28:41.621 --> 00:28:45.430
was on the ground and there was an empty bottle of booze that like,

468
00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:48.790
so artistically had just rolled like,

469
00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:51.490
like two and a half inches away from her hand.

470
00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:54.940
It looked like you were on you.
Yeah.

471
00:28:54.941 --> 00:28:57.880
Like you were on the set of a movie about homeless people like that.

472
00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:00.040
That's just such a perfect shot.

473
00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:05.110
You know about alcoholism and addiction and all of that type of shit.

474
00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:06.550
But it's like real

475
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:08.230
<v 2>okay.</v>

476
00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:11.610
<v 0>Yeah,
we will like walking home from the park,
trying to avoid the hills,
you know,</v>

477
00:29:11.611 --> 00:29:16.260
as much as we could.
And we just got into this,
this,
it was like,
you know,

478
00:29:16.261 --> 00:29:18.980
everybody's got their skid row.
They have a neighborhood,

479
00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:22.700
just a fucking navy,
just walking through,

480
00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:26.890
you know,
I saw this fucking guy,

481
00:29:26.891 --> 00:29:30.040
he's in a wheelchair when these guys in a wheelchair,
but his legs work,

482
00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:34.360
whatever the fuck that deal is,
you know.
And,
uh,

483
00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:40.340
he just had like his shirt pulled up over his face and then his hands,

484
00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:45.010
like covering his face,
like he was the saddest person on the planet.

485
00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:47.613
<v 2>You know,</v>

486
00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:53.010
<v 0>I was walking over the Fillmore and this is blind guy just asking people,</v>

487
00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:57.190
somebody can help them cross the street.
So I was like,
all right,

488
00:29:57.191 --> 00:29:58.480
I'm going that way,
you know?

489
00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:01.900
And then he grabs my arm and then I immediately put my hand on my wallet because

490
00:30:01.901 --> 00:30:03.940
it's like,
all right,
I know I'm a gullible white guy,

491
00:30:03.941 --> 00:30:06.340
but I'm not that fucking dumb.
All right?

492
00:30:06.341 --> 00:30:09.220
So I go to step off the curb and he goes,
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait.

493
00:30:09.221 --> 00:30:11.260
And I was like,
Oh yeah,
you're right.
It's fucking green.

494
00:30:11.261 --> 00:30:14.290
And then I'm looking at him like,
and I start laughing like,

495
00:30:14.291 --> 00:30:16.300
how the fuck did you know that that light was great?
Yeah.

496
00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:17.743
<v 2>Okay.</v>

497
00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.090
<v 0>And he started laughing.
I forget what the fuck.</v>

498
00:30:20.091 --> 00:30:23.660
I guess it makes a noise or some shit like that,
but I almost walked a blind guy.

499
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:26.510
He goes,
you've got to watch out for the buses.

500
00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:30.160
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

501
00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:34.210
<v 0>I almost walked a blind guy right it right into the fucking bus.
Um,</v>

502
00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:38.350
so I'm a fucking liberal SAP,
you know,
this woman says to me,

503
00:30:38.351 --> 00:30:41.920
can you give me blah,
blah,
blah?
She look all sad and she,
I don't know,

504
00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:45.160
something way she fucking asked me.
I was like,
ah,
give us some money.
And I said,

505
00:30:45.161 --> 00:30:49.940
Nate,
you think she's drinking?
And he goes,
yeah.
And I was,

506
00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:53.200
I was like,
all right,
forget it.
I won't fucking,
and he goes,
okay,

507
00:30:53.201 --> 00:30:57.140
if you want to go buy her a sandwich,
I'll fucking do that.
And I was like,

508
00:30:57.141 --> 00:31:00.800
all right.
All right.
You know.
Well,
maybe she needs some fucking boots.

509
00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:05.570
I got a phone call.
Oh,
look who it is.

510
00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:10.490
Local.
It is an old friend of the podcast.
Joe To Rosa.

511
00:31:10.491 --> 00:31:11.990

515
00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:21.743
Remember we used to

516
00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:22.893
<v 7>what up kid?</v>

517
00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:28.030
<v 0>Yeah.
When are we ever going to do another episode of Eddie thing?</v>

518
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:32.230
<v 7>Uh,
no,
I gotta tell Ya.</v>

519
00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:36.530
Hey across the country have asked the same question and

520
00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:40.920
<v 0>was that plural or was it just,
was that one fan or did you actually say fans?</v>

521
00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:42.270
There was a fan,

522
00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:46.970
<v 7>at least one guy in every city asked the same question.
Yeah.</v>

523
00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:51.610
After,
after I opened,
people ask me all the time,
nope,

524
00:31:51.611 --> 00:31:56.200
no bullshit after I opened for you.
And uh,
what was the ladder?

525
00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:00.880
Shitload of people came up to me after the show outside.
They were like,

526
00:32:00.881 --> 00:32:05.820
what are you doing on in forum?
I was like,
dude,
I want to,
I,
I just,

527
00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:07.180
uh,
it's hard,
you know,

528
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:10.980
<v 0>you know what's fucking hilarious about all of this shit,
Joe,</v>

529
00:32:10.981 --> 00:32:14.040
if I jumped in my car,
how quickly would I get to your apartment?

530
00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:16.173
<v 2>Okay.</v>

531
00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:17.260
<v 7>No traffic</v>

532
00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:24.750
with no traffic.
Yeah.
[inaudible] I got a whole set up over here.

533
00:32:24.751 --> 00:32:25.620
Let's just do one.

534
00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:27.980
<v 0>Yeah.
Joe,
I gotta be honest with you.</v>

535
00:32:27.981 --> 00:32:32.960
I have the weirdest relationship with you out of all of my friends because we

536
00:32:32.961 --> 00:32:34.460
never had a falling out.

537
00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:38.090
But how little we see each other and how close we live together.

538
00:32:38.091 --> 00:32:42.830
It's like we had a out,
I don't know what happened.
What happened to us,
Joe.

539
00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:45.500
<v 7>So we tran,</v>

540
00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:50.410
we transcended into family territory.

541
00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:54.730
I consider you family at this point and you know,
you see,

542
00:32:54.731 --> 00:32:59.700
you don't see your family though.
I mean,
honestly,

543
00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:03.180
dude,
I look at you as family.
I'm like,
yeah,
you know,
we're,
we're good.

544
00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:06.630
<v 0>We're going to hate of family back east.
Um,
all right,</v>

545
00:33:06.631 --> 00:33:09.790
well I think there's a reason why you called.
So I guess we could,

546
00:33:09.791 --> 00:33:12.490
we got to do something.
We got it.
We got it.

547
00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:15.030
At least I got to have you on the podcast as a guest.

548
00:33:15.031 --> 00:33:16.680
Is there anything you want to promote Joe?

549
00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:22.620
<v 7>Uh,
Bill,
I have a podcast of my own and I will see you with hell.</v>

550
00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:24.373
That's hard move.

551
00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:27.600
<v 0>Ah,
Joe.
Oh,
it's okay.
It's about that.
It's like Jesus,
Joe,</v>

552
00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.870
he said it's about horror movies.
Sorry,
I talked over here.

553
00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:35.160
<v 7>She could check that out.
And I'm at the old San Jose,</v>

554
00:33:35.161 --> 00:33:39.180
a rooster teeth feathers at the end of the month here the last week of May.

555
00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:42.230
<v 0>Ah,
you're going to shake your ass up there in northern California.</v>

556
00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:46.390
<v 7>Yeah.
Shaken my fucking tail feathers.</v>

557
00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:51.950
<v 0>Making you money.
All right,
let me,
and this fucking podcast,
hang on one second.</v>

558
00:33:51.951 --> 00:33:52.551
All right.
And then I'll,

559
00:33:52.551 --> 00:33:56.270
I'll talk to you about what other bullshit you want to talk about it,
right?
Hey,

560
00:33:56.271 --> 00:34:00.290
by the way,
no,
not,
wait.
No.
Stay on for say,
Hey,
have you gone to [inaudible]?

561
00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.780
Have you been on cal done against Instagram page.

562
00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:06.510
<v 7>Oh,
done against.
No,</v>

563
00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:11.500
<v 0>dude,
it's,
it's the funniest shit.
[inaudible] you have to go on it.</v>

564
00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.680
It's some of the funniest shit I've seen on the fucking Internet.

565
00:34:14.681 --> 00:34:18.160
I'm not threatening your job.
I'm just saying you got to do it.
All right.

566
00:34:18.161 --> 00:34:21.130
Let me wrap up this podcast.
Don't fucking hang up cause you won't pick up.

567
00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:26.380
You know,
you never pick up unless it's a broad there.
Um,
all right.

568
00:34:26.381 --> 00:34:29.980
That's,
that's the Thursday afternoon podcasts.
I gotta talk to my,
uh,

569
00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:34.690
my fucking stepbrother,
Joe to Rosa here.
Enjoy the music.
And uh,

570
00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:38.470
the Thursday afternoon,
just before Friday,
greatest hits that will follow here.

571
00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:41.260
All right,
I'll check in on you on Monday.
You cards.

572
00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:47.893
<v 3>Okay.</v>

573
00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:27.763
[inaudible]

574
00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:34.110
I bought

575
00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:36.060
<v 0>a microphone.
Am I do like when I'm out here,</v>

576
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:41.150
I literally had to a rule about just relaxing when I drive.

577
00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:45.840
And one thing that it helped,
it's very therapeutic for me is letting people go.

578
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:47.510
If you're really like,

579
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:52.670
I get so frustrated with the quality of the driving out here at the inability to

580
00:35:53.911 --> 00:35:58.911
fucking make turns at a decent speed and do when they go buy shit out here,

581
00:36:00.001 --> 00:36:03.440
the second they pass it,
it's it.
They don't even remember it.
They have no fears,

582
00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:05.880
no fucking clue as to what's behind you.

583
00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:08.760
Like you know what they do here out here.
That fucking drives me.

584
00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:10.860
Now you'll be sitting behind some guy at a red light,
you know,

585
00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:12.210
and you're up on his bumper.
You know,

586
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:15.780
like you're supposed to be not in crazy and it's the light turns green.

587
00:36:15.781 --> 00:36:18.060
He then puts his,
uh,
left fucking directly

588
00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:22.570
<v 8>Chanel absolute enraging and it's self centered and yet it's,
it's,
it's,</v>

589
00:36:22.571 --> 00:36:23.404
I'm with you.

590
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:27.040
It's so wrong that I fantasize about pushing him into traffic and know it's

591
00:36:27.041 --> 00:36:30.730
wrong.
You don't have the moral courage to do it.
That's totally,

592
00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:34.090
I think that's totally right and whenever you hear about somebody getting shot

593
00:36:34.091 --> 00:36:38.440
and killed for road rage,
everyone folks goes,
all my God,
that maniac that shot,

594
00:36:38.441 --> 00:36:40.210
that person and I honest to God,

595
00:36:40.211 --> 00:36:44.710
the first thing I think is I'm glad like until I find out that guy with the gun

596
00:36:44.711 --> 00:36:47.020
was the Dick,
right?
Who fucked up first.

597
00:36:47.021 --> 00:36:49.570
I love that you have to find out that the guy with the gun was a dick.

598
00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.580
I know to to find that out.
We'll find out.

599
00:36:51.581 --> 00:36:55.570
The guy with the gun overreacted a little,
but it just,
there's something about,

600
00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:59.600
because people are so self centered and narcissistic when they drive it,

601
00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:01.390
it's a reflection of who they really are.

602
00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:05.170
So that's why we take it so fucking personally may like you let people go.

603
00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:10.070
If the guy,
if a guy doesn't wave,
thank you to me that don't do that apart.

604
00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:10.800
And Lil sin,

605
00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:11.730
<v 0>they don't do that out here.</v>

606
00:37:11.731 --> 00:37:14.820
And I go from like being this fucking mother Theresa Person.

607
00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:18.840
I turned into the devil.
It starts,
I try to stay calm as such,

608
00:37:18.841 --> 00:37:22.320
with a couple of release and my car.
I just got really,
really real.

609
00:37:22.321 --> 00:37:24.150
You're not going to fuck these fucking people out here.

610
00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:27.120
I don't know what the fuck you get a little down before I ended up turning into

611
00:37:27.121 --> 00:37:31.710
that just because some Douche dude,
you see the look on their face,
they're like,

612
00:37:31.711 --> 00:37:35.610
please,
please,
please let me go.
And you'd go to let them go and you think like,

613
00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:38.250
Oh hey,
thumbs up something.
Nothing.
They immediately,

614
00:37:38.251 --> 00:37:42.780
I just back into their own.
Uh hmm.
I Dunno.

615
00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:45.390
I find sometimes I wave at people out here and they look at me like weird.
Like,

616
00:37:45.391 --> 00:37:47.100
what do you know me?
Like I maybe,
you know,

617
00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:51.450
I did move 2,500 miles away from where I learned,
you know,

618
00:37:51.451 --> 00:37:55.050
societal rules.
So maybe,
uh,
but you know,
you just think if you know,

619
00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:58.800
you're waving to another white guy.
I mean,
we were pretty fucking generic.
Yeah.

620
00:37:58.980 --> 00:37:59.813
You know,
if there's not a lot of

621
00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:03.470
<v 8>depth of the culture here,
there's no gang signs right away.
I can see black guys.</v>

622
00:38:03.471 --> 00:38:05.600
He's a little freaked out watching between your fingers at her.

623
00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:09.770
Well plus east coast though is is so aggressive and I hate to do like an la

624
00:38:09.771 --> 00:38:14.570
thing but out here maybe that courtesy like in Boston or New York if someone

625
00:38:14.571 --> 00:38:17.640
lets you cut it and it's like,
Hey motherfucker,
I did you occur to seeing,
okay,

626
00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:20.270
thank you for the courtesy that you're a good shit though.
Welcome,

627
00:38:20.271 --> 00:38:22.110
you're welcome.
But here it's like whoa.

628
00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:25.370
That was just expected because they might do that for each other more out here.

629
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:27.920
It's not a big deal.
That's the only I can think of.

630
00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:31.040
I was on the Pennsylvania turnpike one time driving to a Gig and I know I'm

631
00:38:31.041 --> 00:38:33.050
popping all over.
I'm very self conscious talking.

632
00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:35.030
<v 0>No you don't.
You don't get much credit it,
but I don't,</v>

633
00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:38.250
I don't have anybody to help us out with this.
Okay.
I was a

634
00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:42.670
<v 8>driving to a Gig and the guy cut into my lane and I was doing about 70 it was</v>

635
00:38:42.671 --> 00:38:45.370
raining and he had a trailer

636
00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:47.043
<v 0>normal.
And I'm like,</v>

637
00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:51.700
<v 8>it was a rear wheel drive to with my Mustang,
real hunker,
shit,</v>

638
00:38:51.701 --> 00:38:55.600
fucking hydrocodone cognitive call and I'm driving and this guy's coming into my

639
00:38:55.601 --> 00:38:57.910
lane and I immediately,
your mind when you think you're going to die,

640
00:38:57.911 --> 00:39:00.880
it goes very quickly.
And I'm like,
okay,
you got to slam on the brakes,

641
00:39:00.881 --> 00:39:03.930
you're going to have an accident.
Hit the wall.
Like it tried to it.

642
00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:06.770
<v 0>Yeah,
that's smart.
Yeah,
slow,
slow yourself down.
Sideswiped the wall.</v>

643
00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:08.640
<v 8>So like jam on the brake.</v>

644
00:39:08.641 --> 00:39:11.760
I hit the horn and he veers out and we don't have the accident.

645
00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:16.200
So then I'm not afraid.
I'm in a rage at this fucking guy.
Right.

646
00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:19.980
And I pull up next to them and it's a,
it's a,
you know,
I have a fat black dude,

647
00:39:19.981 --> 00:39:23.550
like you know,
family mopey guy and I'm ready to really,

648
00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:26.430
you know Cleveland from family guy.
He's actually,
yes,

649
00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:28.250
William Stephenson fellows of the college

650
00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:32.460
and he looks at me and he gives me the like,
oops,
I fucked

651
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:34.240
<v 0>dup.
Wave like up,
sorry.</v>

652
00:39:34.241 --> 00:39:37.950
And it gives me that and every bit of anger drinks cause he,
he,

653
00:39:37.951 --> 00:39:42.520
he just owned up to it.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Yeah,
I way back.
No problem.

654
00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:47.500
Yeah,
that was that in a second my rage,
I was gone.
Do you know,
it's funny,

655
00:39:47.501 --> 00:39:52.360
I sometimes when somebody acts on the rage,
even though I know it's wrong,

656
00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:55.780
I sort of lived through the,

657
00:39:55.781 --> 00:39:58.210
the fucking ecstasy that that must be like,

658
00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:01.810
do you remember when Russell Crowe through the phone?
I said,
Guy,

659
00:40:01.811 --> 00:40:05.680
I just can't imagine like when you're in a hotel and you're not getting the

660
00:40:05.681 --> 00:40:10.390
customer service you want on whatever it is that the fact that you actually take

661
00:40:10.391 --> 00:40:14.440
the machine that they won't help you with and fucking hurt somebody,

662
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:17.470
the person who is not helping you,
you fucking hurt him with it.
Yeah,

663
00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:22.610
completely wrong thing to do.
But I can't imagine.
I always was wondering why.

664
00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:25.930
Cause he's letting that phone go.
Just,
Ah,

665
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:29.410
just fucking all that rage going at him.
I think it was,
it was good for him,

666
00:40:29.411 --> 00:40:31.840
was bad for the guy behind the,
uh,
behind the counter.

667
00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:32.903
Behind the counter was bout people.

668
00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:35.570
<v 8>We'll learn the lesson that day.
Russell Crowe learned not to do it.</v>

669
00:40:35.571 --> 00:40:39.110
The other guy probably learn better fucking customer service next time because I

670
00:40:39.111 --> 00:40:42.770
remember when that happened I was in the Greenwich Hotel and I wish Deniro owns

671
00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:44.530
and I remember like,

672
00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.770
<v 0>Oh my God,
that's a really nice place.
It's beautiful.</v>

673
00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.350
Like he would stay at a dive when a stupid comment,
but I remember things

674
00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:52.760
<v 8>in the satisfaction.
It must've felt when the phone hit the guy,</v>

675
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:55.670
like how good that must have felt a throw that phone with that motherfucker.

676
00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:58.570
And again,
he got in big trouble for that.
But yeah,
that was just is a story

677
00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:00.940
<v 0>that I do.
You know how mad you are,
you're,</v>

678
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:05.200
you're pulling the wires out of the wall and that voice is still not going,
okay,

679
00:41:05.201 --> 00:41:07.480
what are you doing doing?
What are you doing?
And then you wrap it up,

680
00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:10.840
you leave your hotel,
you're walking down the hall.
He leave your room,

681
00:41:10.841 --> 00:41:13.670
you get into the fucking elevator and your brain's still going.
Yeah.

682
00:41:13.671 --> 00:41:16.600
Throw it at him.
Yeah.
Throw it out.
What happened?
Well,
I mean he,

683
00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:18.940
he went downstairs to the front.
I mean,
I don't,

684
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.970
I was just going to pick the phone up off the desk and just threw them.
Oh,

685
00:41:21.971 --> 00:41:25.360
I thought he was upstairs in his room.
Maybe he was,
but I thought that I didn't,

686
00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:28.120
I didn't,
I thought he just picked the phone up and threw it at the guy.

687
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:31.900
That makes way more sense if I find out that he actually wrapped the court and

688
00:41:31.901 --> 00:41:34.220
took the phone from downstairs.

689
00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:38.000
<v 8>That makes me love him more.
I was,
I loved him just for picking it up.</v>

690
00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:40.700
Probably fucked it up.
I fucked up everything.
I don't know.

691
00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:44.180
Do you know the other day I actually called the periodic chart?

692
00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:47.390
I called it the periodical.
This,
yeah,
but that's the understanding.
I mean,

693
00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:52.520
once it was on breaking bad,
it's no excuse.
It's like you're on a,

694
00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.920
you're on a western,
you call it a cowboy.
You had,

695
00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:01.220
how do you not fucking know?
It shows you the amount of fucking research I did.

696
00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:22.273
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

697
00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:26.453
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

698
00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:42.273
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

699
00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:43.350
<v 10>hey,
what's going on?</v>

700
00:42:43.351 --> 00:42:47.430
It's bill burr and this is the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

701
00:42:47.490 --> 00:42:51.990
May 17th,
2010.
How the hell are you?

702
00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:56.220
How are you doing?
How's your work?
We'd go,
I,
yeah,
yeah.

703
00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:02.640
Uh,
I just,
uh,
this is one of these days,
right?
Where I should,
I shouldn't,

704
00:43:02.641 --> 00:43:03.001
you know something,

705
00:43:03.001 --> 00:43:07.590
I'm gonna start having tap out days where I don't do the fucking podcast because

706
00:43:07.591 --> 00:43:11.910
I just got off a goddamn flight and I am fucking exhausted.
Once again,

707
00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:16.500
I flew across this goddamn country and once again it was the usual shit,

708
00:43:17.370 --> 00:43:18.000
you know?

709
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.820
And I don't want to make fun of people who are out of shape because they've got

710
00:43:20.821 --> 00:43:25.500
a really heartfelt letter from somebody who was opie saying,
what the fuck?

711
00:43:25.501 --> 00:43:27.780
Why you always trash in fat people?
Which I'm not.

712
00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:32.910
That's all you're hearing because that's the one that pulls on your
heartstrings.

713
00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:36.710
You know,
when he writes the whole fucking thing about how blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

714
00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:40.170
blue,

Yada,
Yada,
all this fucking Shit,
you know,
you know,

715
00:43:40.171 --> 00:43:42.120
everybody feels,
everybody,
whatever group they're in,

716
00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:46.770
they feel like they get it the worst.
You know,
we get it the worst,
you know,

717
00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:51.060
even Blahblahblah when they blue blue,
blue people lease sake again,

718
00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:55.680
right?
But when they say,
fuck,
I know,
please.
All right,

719
00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:59.460
everybody thinks they got it the worst and only one person is right.
Okay.

720
00:43:59.490 --> 00:44:04.380
So you've got like a fucking 85% chance of being wrong.
You know,

721
00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:08.310
nobody says,
uh,
you know,
I'm going to beat you like an obese stepchild.
Do they?

722
00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:11.040
They don't.
They say on a beach,
you're like a red headed stepchild.

723
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:14.850
They don't have kick a fat Guy Day,
do they?
They have kick a fucking redhead day,

724
00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:17.070
a Ginger Day,
right?
That's what they have.

725
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.480
Mia did make a fucking video about,
uh,
the,

726
00:44:21.481 --> 00:44:24.990
the fucking genocide of obese people.
Did she?
No,
she didn't.

727
00:44:24.991 --> 00:44:27.840
She made it a red heads and it was funny.
Even on me.

728
00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:30.980
I've been so beaten down as a fucking red head.
All right?

729
00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:35.420
So quit your fucking whining.
You know,

730
00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:39.740
it's a fucking podcast.
I trash everybody.

731
00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:45.080
Everybody's going down,
including myself.
Everybody goes down this week,

732
00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:50.150
okay?
If my Bruins are going to lose four games in a fucking row,

733
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:54.670
and I got to listen to Keith Robinson,
okay?

734
00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:58.030
A guy who my entire time of knowing them,

735
00:44:58.031 --> 00:45:01.780
every time I tried to bring up hockey goes,
ah,
hawkish sticks.
I don't like it.

736
00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:04.810
Nobody cares about hockey.
All of a sudden he gives a fuck.

737
00:45:06.610 --> 00:45:08.260
You know what's funny about that?
Fucking ignorant.

738
00:45:08.261 --> 00:45:13.261
Jacquez he wouldn't even have known that the Bruins had a historical collapse

739
00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:22.900
of,
of,
of,
of,
you know,
I'm so stupid of historical proportions.

740
00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:24.670
He wouldn't even have known.

741
00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:27.670
It's just that ESPN finally showed some fucking hockey.

742
00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:30.080
Jesus Christ.

743
00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:35.000
I was in Boston when it happened and I really want to tell Philly people that

744
00:45:35.001 --> 00:45:37.820
everybody was devastated.
But I gotta be honest with you,

745
00:45:37.821 --> 00:45:42.380
I think maybe 11% of the city gave a shit.
And I'll tell you why,

746
00:45:42.381 --> 00:45:46.160
because we haven't won in 38 fucking years.

747
00:45:46.161 --> 00:45:50.740
And we've pretty much sucked.
Um,

748
00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:55.630
the Bruins kind of jumped the shark when Ray Borg had to leave the team so he'd

749
00:45:55.631 --> 00:45:57.130
have an opportunity to win.

750
00:45:57.610 --> 00:46:02.610
And then he went out to Colorado one the cup and then I know he will,

751
00:46:03.530 --> 00:46:05.140
he meant this in a good way.

752
00:46:05.530 --> 00:46:10.530
He brought the cup to the city to remind everybody in Boston what it look like.

753
00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:15.700
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

754
00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:19.130
<v 10>And that was the low point,
you know,
that was a low point.</v>

755
00:46:19.131 --> 00:46:22.040
And then we were up three games to one against the Canadians and we couldn't

756
00:46:22.041 --> 00:46:23.900
close them out.
We lost that fucking series.

757
00:46:23.901 --> 00:46:25.730
Then they blew up the team when they traded away.

758
00:46:25.731 --> 00:46:28.820
Gone Chad and fucking Joe door and dude,
fuck them.

759
00:46:28.821 --> 00:46:32.720
The couple of queers they leaders do.

760
00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:37.340
So we trade away our best fucking guys for what?
Who Do we get?

761
00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:42.380
We got a fucking a baby face Magoo.
Well,

762
00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:45.200
we ended up trading to fucking Toronto.
That's the only thing I got.

763
00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:48.680
I got right now we've got the number one pick,
fulfill fucking castle.

764
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:53.180
That's all I got right now.
But um,
anyways,

765
00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:57.560
uh,
I don't know what happened in that series.
All of a sudden they just stay,

766
00:46:57.561 --> 00:47:02.420
just fucking sucked.
It wasn't like they weren't even trying,

767
00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:06.990
they weren't even fucking truck.
They were just standing there going,
wow,

768
00:47:06.991 --> 00:47:11.790
look at the fliers.
Jesus Christ.
God,
that Guy Skate.
Oh,

769
00:47:11.791 --> 00:47:14.100
hang on a second.
I'm going to try to clear it out of the zone.

770
00:47:14.310 --> 00:47:17.180
And the guy would take a slap shot at,
he couldn't get,

771
00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:20.130
he couldn't even clear it out of the fucking zone.

772
00:47:20.131 --> 00:47:22.170
It would go like sideways into the boards.

773
00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:29.140
Jesus Christ.
Oh my God.
That fucking Mac Davis looking jackass,
Hartnell,

774
00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:30.820
whatever the fuck his name is.

775
00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:34.900
He was funny about Hartnell is after the game when he's not,

776
00:47:34.901 --> 00:47:38.860
when he's not wearing a helmet,
he looks like a scary son of a bitch,

777
00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:43.780
like Jesus Christ,
that that guy just come out of the woods,

778
00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:49.960
you know,
does does,
does,
you know he fucking,
he just see,

779
00:47:49.961 --> 00:47:52.900
just looks like,
I don't know what he looks like.
He looks like a mountain man.

780
00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:54.910
He puts said that helmet on.

781
00:47:54.911 --> 00:47:58.340
All of a sudden he looks like he's in blades of glory,
you know,

782
00:47:58.450 --> 00:48:02.580
and he fucking guy can't even skate every
return.

783
00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:06.790
He goes and make a pass,
he falls down.
But the fuckers there though,
tapping it in

784
00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:12.260
Ganni,
Brie air,
all those fucking assholes.
Congratulations Philly.

785
00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:15.910
You guys totally deserve it.
Uh,
you know,
unlike the Bruins,
you didn't quit.

786
00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:20.560
He kept playing the game.
Yeah.
Dot.
I don't know what happened that she,

787
00:48:20.561 --> 00:48:24.250
the Bruins play the game right through game four and they played the first

788
00:48:24.251 --> 00:48:27.610
period of game seven and a little bit of the third period.

789
00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:32.170
You know,
and I know this sounds like I'm taking away from the flyers,
but dude,

790
00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:36.400
they were just standing there and they had one line that would actually go out

791
00:48:36.401 --> 00:48:38.440
and start checking some of the fliers.
And when they did,

792
00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:41.410
all of a sudden we were getting,
we would get an opportunities.
It's like,

793
00:48:41.411 --> 00:48:45.370
why wouldn't you continue doing that?
Was,
is that crazy?

794
00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:50.170
Yet another job,
Craig,
he had on the bench.
Did he also sent to the bench go,

795
00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:53.650
oh yeah guys,
by the way,
don't forget to play hockey when you're out there.

796
00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:57.670
And uh,
when they're,
when they're around our net and they have the puck,

797
00:48:57.790 --> 00:49:01.240
it's usually a good thing to try to,
you know,
disrupt them.

798
00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:06.240
Trying to put it into the net rather than just standing there and waiting for

799
00:49:06.281 --> 00:49:10.660
them to shoot it in the neck into the net so you then can whack your stick on

800
00:49:10.661 --> 00:49:15.340
the ice and frustration.
Oh jeepers,
they did it again.
Golly,
Gee,

801
00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:19.150
Gee Wiz.
I was fucking brutal.
Is Bad enough.

802
00:49:19.151 --> 00:49:23.140
I had to sit there and watch the Bruins lose,
but I was in Boston,
which means,

803
00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:24.260
and this is a great thing,
uh,

804
00:49:24.261 --> 00:49:28.390
about fucking being in Boston is you guys know how I feel about Dan Shaughnessy.

805
00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:32.770
Okay.
The Guy,
he knows baseball,
I'll give,
you know,
I will give him that.

806
00:49:32.771 --> 00:49:33.640
But other than that,

807
00:49:33.850 --> 00:49:37.930
he has made a fucking career on misery.

808
00:49:38.290 --> 00:49:41.410
The guy loves misery.
There's any fucking misery to be found.

809
00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:45.280
And I give a fuck if somebody's playing highligh or stick ball,

810
00:49:45.370 --> 00:49:49.030
he's going to be there to write a fucking story.
And the great thing is,

811
00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:52.720
is he doesn't have the decency to know a God damn thing about the sport.

812
00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:58.500
All he's gotta do is just talk about this misery that's about ready to happen or

813
00:49:58.661 --> 00:50:02.890
is happening and then somehow tie it in to fucking game.

814
00:50:02.891 --> 00:50:07.480
Six of the 1986 red sox met series.
That's what the fuck he did with hockey.

815
00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:12.310
If anybody who lives in Boston still has,
I was going to grab one of the Globes,

816
00:50:12.311 --> 00:50:14.290
Boston gloves.
It's fucking hilarious.

817
00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:20.110
I was saying at the night when we lost and I was in a bar with like eight other

818
00:50:20.111 --> 00:50:20.944
people,

819
00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:25.120
was more fucking flat screens on than there were fucking Bruins fans at that

820
00:50:25.121 --> 00:50:28.040
point.
Right.
Typical of all cities

821
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:29.650
<v 12>at do it.
That meant diehard it midday.</v>

822
00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:31.760
Everybody's fucking die when they win a championship,

823
00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:34.280
all of a sudden when they shit the bed,
four games in a row,

824
00:50:34.610 --> 00:50:38.090
you're not doing a credit to the Celtics cut into the Celtics course.
You are.

825
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:44.030
You like a winner,
don't Ya.
Um,
but I was lily stand there going,

826
00:50:44.031 --> 00:50:45.650
you watch this guy,
he'll somehow to do,
you know,

827
00:50:45.651 --> 00:50:48.230
he'll bring it around to the curse of the bay,
which of course he does.

828
00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:52.190
And the great thing is,
is he does not know shit about hockey.

829
00:50:52.191 --> 00:50:57.191
All he did was he looked at the box score to see who scored when just so he

830
00:50:57.831 --> 00:50:58.370
could be,

831
00:50:58.370 --> 00:51:03.370
and it's 1748 of the second period when a fucking hot and I'll shot the puck in

832
00:51:04.731 --> 00:51:09.140
the net then.
So he could then be like,
uh,
it was quieter in the,

833
00:51:09.141 --> 00:51:13.130
in the garden than it was in Fenway back and fucking puppet with Mookie Wilson.

834
00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:17.900
He,
I,
you guys are the worst.
He's the fucking worse.
And he's got,
he just,
I dunno,

835
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:22.990
I just don't understand how that guy still has a job and why people in Boston

836
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:26.480
continue to buy his books about fucking misery.

837
00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:28.130
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

838
00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:30.590
<v 10>You know,
he's such a pussy.</v>

839
00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:35.990
Anytime anything remotely bad starts to happen in Boston sports,

840
00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:39.470
he always got,
oh my God,
what's gonna Happen?

841
00:51:41.930 --> 00:51:44.570
It's,
it's really,
is that how you fucking approach,
you know,

842
00:51:46.450 --> 00:51:49.570
whatever the fucking word is for adversity,
adversity,
that's the word.

843
00:51:49.571 --> 00:51:51.790
That's how you approach it.
It isn't,

844
00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:56.110
you wouldn't have gotten to the level that you're at as a sports writer and

845
00:51:56.111 --> 00:51:59.470
being on ESPN if that's how you approach adversity.

846
00:51:59.471 --> 00:52:01.960
So stop to eat and don't use your fucking lazy.

847
00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:06.990
Learn about the Goddamn gay before you write another one year lazy ass fucking

848
00:52:07.031 --> 00:52:08.470
articles.
Dan Shaughnessy,

849
00:52:10.890 --> 00:52:13.420
do you want to see what this guy looks like?
I'll tell you right now,
just go,

850
00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:17.950
go to fucking uh,
the EMM podcast.com.

851
00:52:18.730 --> 00:52:20.950
Get on my nice fucking photo.
Put up with him this week.

852
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:23.920
That noodle hair looking jackass.
Do you know,

853
00:52:23.921 --> 00:52:25.990
I remember like a year after the red sox,

854
00:52:26.410 --> 00:52:30.430
after they came back being down four games to none,

855
00:52:30.970 --> 00:52:35.560
you know,
not against some sad sack fucking team that barely met,

856
00:52:35.590 --> 00:52:38.530
made the Goddamn play offs.
It doesn't have a fucking score.

857
00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:43.330
They came back against a 210 to one a million dollar fucking team with like four

858
00:52:43.331 --> 00:52:47.250
or five first ballot hall of famers.
We go on and and,

859
00:52:47.450 --> 00:52:48.850
and when the God damn world series,

860
00:52:48.851 --> 00:52:52.840
the very next year in September we got a couple of injuries.

861
00:52:52.930 --> 00:52:56.740
We had like a six or seven game lead against the Yankees and all of a sudden the

862
00:52:56.741 --> 00:53:00.880
Yankees come on and we start to lose a little bit and this fucking idiot writes,

863
00:53:01.150 --> 00:53:05.560
the curse is back.
You can feel it.
It's back.
It's in the water.

864
00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:09.580
You know,
it's the curse of what Dan of course of what?

865
00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:16.480
2004 the the what of the fucking let 11 month curse.

866
00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:17.730
The curse of what that,

867
00:53:17.770 --> 00:53:21.160
that no one wants to buy your stupid fucking book about misery.

868
00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:26.340
Is that what it is?
I Dunno.
I gotta admit.

869
00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:29.010
I think that was the worst part about the Bruins losing four games in a row

870
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:33.240
cause for the fucking life on me.
I still don't hate the flyers.

871
00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:38.130
I actually like Carsello I really like them and I hate the fucking Canadians.

872
00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:42.690
I hate the Canadians in of a flyer fan gave me shit.
I Made I,

873
00:53:42.691 --> 00:53:45.960
I sit there and take it Canadian fit gave me shit.

874
00:53:45.961 --> 00:53:48.600
I'm not going to take it cause I'll tell ya the end of the fucking day,

875
00:53:48.601 --> 00:53:52.140
that flyer fed,
he's from the United States.
That's a fellow countryman.

876
00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:54.960
So all he's gonna do is trashed the Bruins.

877
00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:58.400
He's not going to trash the good old USA.
That's why I don't like to convey this.

878
00:53:58.560 --> 00:53:59.730
Why I hate the Canadians fans of most.

879
00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:03.060
They fucking trashed my team and my country.
I'll tell you right now,

880
00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:05.940
I won't stand for it with their little pointy little French noses.

881
00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:10.530
They appointed a little French noses.
Huh?
Talking about yesteryear.

882
00:54:10.590 --> 00:54:13.980
I'll walk around with that high school fucking Letterman jackets up on how they

883
00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:16.920
used to dominate the league 30 fucking years ago.

884
00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:18.480
Let me tell you some right now Canadians,

885
00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:23.250
you guys can fucking slide all over the ice block and as many shots as you like

886
00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:27.240
cause you goaltender actually sucks these any fucking good.

887
00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:30.060
Why you guys flopping around like a bunch of goddamn flounders every time

888
00:54:30.061 --> 00:54:33.810
someone takes a fucking wrist shot,
oh my God,

889
00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:38.940
whatever.
Am I really trashing teams that are still in it?

890
00:54:38.941 --> 00:54:41.430
I'm going to shut the fuck up now.
What am I going to do?
Okay.

891
00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:44.790
What goes around comes around.
I've talked a lot of shit.

892
00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:48.960
My teams have won a bunch of championships.
We deserve some sort of,
you know,

893
00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:52.470
it's the balance,
Dan Shaughnessy.
It's the balance,
okay?

894
00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:57.030
He can't win all those fucking championships in five years and not expect to get

895
00:54:57.031 --> 00:55:01.590
kicked in the seeds as a sports fan.
All right?
But do me a fucking favor.

896
00:55:01.890 --> 00:55:04.860
Don't write any more articles about hockey because you don't know a fucking

897
00:55:04.861 --> 00:55:07.620
thing about it with your glancing at the box score,

898
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:09.870
curse to the Bay Horse Shit that you wrote,

899
00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:11.650
<v 11>okay?</v>

900
00:55:11.650 --> 00:55:14.560
<v 10>They should surround this.
What they should do with all those globe though,</v>

901
00:55:14.770 --> 00:55:17.320
debt piece of shit article he wrote,
they should snip it all out.

902
00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:22.450
Tie Him to a stake and use that as a stuff that you use to start a fire.

903
00:55:22.690 --> 00:55:23.680
Whatever that word is.

904
00:55:26.530 --> 00:55:27.910
What does that word come on?

905
00:55:27.911 --> 00:55:32.911
Help me out here that we're to use when you stoke a fire with something gives

906
00:55:33.131 --> 00:55:36.340
with a k,
doesn't it kill in a kit,
Caitlin or cut something?

907
00:55:36.341 --> 00:55:39.990
I don't know what the fuck it is.
Jesus Christ.
I don't,
I don't,
you know,

908
00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:47.520
if you gave me a three games to none lead with like fucking six of my friends,

909
00:55:48.701 --> 00:55:53.620
I used to play pond hockey with,
we could have one,
one fucking game.

910
00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:57.080
Jesus Christ

911
00:55:59.650 --> 00:56:01.660
just fucking standing around,

912
00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:07.570
standing around.
Then they went up three games,

913
00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:10.690
three goals to none in game seven.

914
00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:15.600
Then all of a sudden they score the flyers score one goal,

915
00:56:15.601 --> 00:56:20.490
and then they go back to that pussy hockey again.
Oh my God,
he's good to go.

916
00:56:20.730 --> 00:56:22.800
Do you think they're gonna score another one?

917
00:56:25.330 --> 00:56:30.010
It was.
It was pathetic.
And uh,

918
00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:34.300
I dunno,
I am ashamed.
I'm ashamed.

919
00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:36.760
I'm ashamed of my team,

920
00:56:36.761 --> 00:56:40.840
but I still love him and I'm still wearing my bro and shit.
I don't give a fuck.

921
00:56:41.590 --> 00:56:45.910
You know who gives a fuck lose three games in a row?
Four games in a row.

922
00:56:46.690 --> 00:56:50.140
Yeah.
Why would you give a shit?
You know?
You know,
I know.

923
00:56:50.141 --> 00:56:52.570
I like how these idiots are sitting there talking about hockey right now,

924
00:56:52.571 --> 00:56:55.450
going like,
you know,
and it's wide open this year.
It's fucking wide open.

925
00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:55.920
You know,

926
00:56:55.920 --> 00:57:00.010
they've the number one seat to seat to seat and unforeseen is fucking got.
Yeah.

927
00:57:00.011 --> 00:57:03.880
That's because the two teams that are left beat those teams.
Stupid.

928
00:57:04.790 --> 00:57:09.410
All right,
well actually no,
the Bruins beat the fucking third seat,

929
00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:11.120
whatever.
I'm just saying.

930
00:57:11.570 --> 00:57:14.090
And all of a sudden people are looking at the Canadians like a,

931
00:57:14.310 --> 00:57:16.210
they'd like add still in eighth seed team.

932
00:57:16.220 --> 00:57:18.770
They are still an AFC team but you know,

933
00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:20.750
they'd beat the capitals and the penguins.

934
00:57:21.170 --> 00:57:24.710
So I would have to think that they are odds on favorite to win it.

935
00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:30.110
And um,
I know this is boring the shit out of everybody.

936
00:57:30.111 --> 00:57:34.460
I've literally talked about hockey for 15 fucking minutes.
Have I?
Ah,

937
00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:37.340
fuck you guys.
I don't give a shit.
All right.

938
00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:43.120
In this next round I am for the Black Hawks and I am for and uh,

939
00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:46.130
I am for the flyers.

940
00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:53.040
My nightmare finals obviously is the Canadians for San Jose because I hate both

941
00:57:54.371 --> 00:57:56.800
of those teams.
I respect San Jose.

942
00:57:56.801 --> 00:57:59.680
I went there there actually it's a hockey town.
They fucking loved that team,

943
00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:03.010
even though,
even though they fucking choke every year,
but I got to,

944
00:58:03.011 --> 00:58:05.080
I just don't like how they,
you know,
they annoy me.

945
00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:06.560
<v 11>Yeah.</v>

946
00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:07.393
<v 10>San Jose.</v>

947
00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:12.430
And they annoy me because they remind me of how annoying my French Omaha,

948
00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:14.420
how my franchise never fucking signs anybody.

949
00:58:14.421 --> 00:58:18.560
And they somehow sign everybody in there in and under the fucking cap.
But,
uh,

950
00:58:18.561 --> 00:58:23.360
I gotta go for the Black Hawks because they haven't won it since 61 and a,

951
00:58:23.361 --> 00:58:26.750
so I'm pulling for that team and uh,

952
00:58:26.810 --> 00:58:30.580
and then I got a pull for the flyers because,
uh,
I dunno,

953
00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:34.010
I actually always have liked the flyers.
I have to admit I always liked him.

954
00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:37.370
I liked the fights back in the fucking day.
Oh.
And speaking of that,

955
00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:40.560
I remember that shit before the series started,
they got this new show on,

956
00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:44.780
on the versus network,
this round table of like for regular dudes.

957
00:58:44.781 --> 00:58:46.610
And then we'll have like some big sports star.
Come on.

958
00:58:46.611 --> 00:58:49.430
I'm not saying if it's a good show,
a bad show,
but I saw somebody on,

959
00:58:49.431 --> 00:58:53.990
I believe it was that show go in like a Bruins verse.
Flyers.
Oh God,

960
00:58:53.991 --> 00:58:56.990
this is going to be a bloodbath.
Okay.

961
00:58:57.050 --> 00:59:00.200
Just for the fucking record for people who don't fucking watch hockey,

962
00:59:00.201 --> 00:59:03.440
it's not 1979 anymore.
All right.
And the Bruins,

963
00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:05.660
it flyers just played seven games,

964
00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:10.490
seven games I believe.
Two of which that went into overtime.

965
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:12.560
I'm already trying to block the whole memory,

966
00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:16.010
that series out and there wasn't one fucking fight.

967
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:21.000
There wasn't even at any cheap shot.
There was,
I can't remember.
I've,
I don't,

968
00:59:21.050 --> 00:59:23.000
wasn't mean I wasn't really paying attention with the Bruins.

969
00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:25.280
Enema went one point.
Mac Davis there got,

970
00:59:25.281 --> 00:59:28.570
got to stick to his face best cause the dude was trying to lift the stick up and

971
00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:31.640
he missed it.
You know,
we've got a couple of fucking stitches.

972
00:59:33.690 --> 00:59:38.280
Yeah.
Ah,
fuck it.
All right.
That's it there.
I addressed it.
So,
uh,

973
00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:43.430
I dunno,
whatever.
I heard there's a really good guy in the draft next year.

974
00:59:44.210 --> 00:59:47.000
Taylor Hawkins.
Is that his name or is that the drummer from the foo fighters?

975
00:59:47.001 --> 00:59:50.810
I can't fucking remember.
I don't know any of that shit.
I'm just hoping,
look,

976
00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:55.760
this is all I wanted.
All I wanted was us to fucking a,
after we beat the,
the,
uh,

977
00:59:55.761 --> 00:59:57.140
the fucking savers,

978
00:59:57.500 --> 01:00:00.140
just to have a good showing in the next round eight when we fucking lose.

979
01:00:00.141 --> 01:00:02.330
I don't care.
I know we're rebuilding,

980
01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:07.100
but did you have to shit the bed to that fucking level?

981
01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:12.450
All right.
Whatever.
This is the Monday morning podcast.
This is a,
a,
a,

982
01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:17.330
a special hockey edition of the,
uh,
the Monday morning podcast.

983
01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:21.930
Um,
all right.
I don't even know where the fuck to go from here.
Uh,

984
01:00:22.070 --> 01:00:26.120
how about a youtube video?
I,
I might've even hyped this thing last week.
Uh,

985
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:30.230
this is one of these things.
Um,
uh,
just search this.

986
01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:34.430
Don't fall asleep at a baseball game.
Just watch that.
And uh,

987
01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:35.450
for all you women out there,

988
01:00:35.451 --> 01:00:40.280
you'll realize how much fun it is to be a guy when you watch this video.
Like,

989
01:00:40.281 --> 01:00:45.110
we can have fun when there's absolutely nothing going on.
And not only that,

990
01:00:45.111 --> 01:00:49.730
it's fucking hilarious.
Are you saying that we can't have fun?
Actually,

991
01:00:49.731 --> 01:00:53.240
I think I kind of am,
but I think the reality is,

992
01:00:53.241 --> 01:00:57.470
is I just don't understand your fun.
So I want this,
this fall.

993
01:00:57.471 --> 01:01:02.460
You all the ladies out there.
Uh,
why don't you watch that video.
Okay.
And,

994
01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:06.990
uh,
I challenge you not to fucking laugh.
Well,
I guess you won't,
you won't laugh.

995
01:01:06.991 --> 01:01:09.840
You guys are great liars and your greater controlling your fucking emotion.

996
01:01:09.841 --> 01:01:12.780
So you want,
but I'm just telling you it's a funny fucking video.
All right,

997
01:01:13.530 --> 01:01:16.290
now you,
and,
and if you want to show me how women have fun,

998
01:01:16.291 --> 01:01:20.580
you show me a video of women doing like absolutely nothing is going on,

999
01:01:20.790 --> 01:01:22.290
but it's still fucking hilarious.

1000
01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:26.760
Find one of those on youtube and I'll have a little more respect for whatever it

1001
01:01:26.761 --> 01:01:31.470
is that you do because my references are,
I guess,
uh,

1002
01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:34.790
sex in the city.
You know?

1003
01:01:36.590 --> 01:01:38.750
Is that even a reference?
I don't know.
Just the women I've dated,

1004
01:01:38.751 --> 01:01:42.160
I've always watched that fucking show,
you know?

1005
01:01:42.250 --> 01:01:44.500
Can you believe that I'm making another fucking one of those movies they make

1006
01:01:44.590 --> 01:01:47.200
and another sex and the city movie and now they're going to Egypt.

1007
01:01:47.201 --> 01:01:49.660
At what point are they just going to let that fucking thing die?

1008
01:01:49.930 --> 01:01:54.490
Why don't they just have the cast of the drew Carey show show up and that's what

1009
01:01:54.491 --> 01:01:54.971
they should do.

1010
01:01:54.971 --> 01:01:58.360
And then turn it into colleague Leah and somebody gets fisted and then just

1011
01:01:58.361 --> 01:02:00.190
fucking ended.
Can somebody just end?

1012
01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:03.010
This really has nothing to do with either one of those franchises.

1013
01:02:03.011 --> 01:02:05.950
It has to do with my fucking jet lag and uh,

1014
01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:09.400
and the Bruins complete fucking collapse.

1015
01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:11.230
<v 11>Okay.</v>

1016
01:02:11.230 --> 01:02:12.220
<v 10>Yeah.
Fuck it hurts.</v>

1017
01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:23.280
Uh,
Jesus.
All right.
You know,
I drank a lot this past week.
Um,

1018
01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:29.090
this is,
this is,
I realized something.
This is a big test in a relationship.

1019
01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:33.020
I don't give a fuck how beautiful you think a woman is,
how much you love her,

1020
01:02:33.590 --> 01:02:37.160
how much she makes her heart go pitter patter your heart.
Go pitter patter.
The,

1021
01:02:37.161 --> 01:02:41.360
the true test of whether or not you can stand.

1022
01:02:41.530 --> 01:02:45.320
You're going to be able to stand the woman that you think you're going to spend

1023
01:02:45.321 --> 01:02:50.321
the rest of your life with is if you can handle what her voice sounds like when

1024
01:02:50.481 --> 01:02:54.110
she's trying to yell over the noise in a bar.

1025
01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:58.850
If you can handle what that sounds like

1026
01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:03.550
and you just fill in your funny punchline right there because evidently I don't

1027
01:03:03.551 --> 01:03:06.070
have the fucking energy to do it.
Whatever.

1028
01:03:06.071 --> 01:03:08.770
I just talked for hockey for 17 minutes to my fucking self.

1029
01:03:08.771 --> 01:03:12.310
I trashed Dan Shaughnessy.
I told the fat guy to stand down.

1030
01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:16.930
You know fucking people want sympathy cause they always eat the last cookie

1031
01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:22.120
rally.
Selfoss sons of bitches.
Um,
alright.

1032
01:03:22.450 --> 01:03:23.530
You know what I'm going to do this week?

1033
01:03:23.531 --> 01:03:27.880
I'm going to tap out by reading some fucking emails from some of my listeners.

1034
01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:29.290
Oh,
here's something I learned this week.

1035
01:03:29.291 --> 01:03:33.550
Did you know that the natural color of rubber is white?
Did you know that?

1036
01:03:33.551 --> 01:03:36.130
I didn't know that went by this guy's place.

1037
01:03:36.131 --> 01:03:39.970
He had this collection of fucking cars and old motorcycles and I love that shit

1038
01:03:40.510 --> 01:03:43.360
cause I wish I was good at working on cars.
You know what I mean?

1039
01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:48.970
I wish I had like a set set of wrenches and anyone working on a car,
you know,

1040
01:03:50.290 --> 01:03:53.620
greasy rag and my back pocket,
I could fucking,
you know,

1041
01:03:53.621 --> 01:03:57.700
find that right spot and the jukebox and make it play a song,
you know?

1042
01:04:00.250 --> 01:04:04.690
But I can't,
you know,
I killed that.
You know what?
Fuck you.
I could,
I could,

1043
01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:06.220
if I took some time,

1044
01:04:06.221 --> 01:04:09.610
I watched a couple youtube videos and he gave me a regular old engine.

1045
01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:13.240
I could do some shit.
I could figure out some stuff maybe in another life.

1046
01:04:13.241 --> 01:04:16.120
I don't know what.
So anyways,
this guy had an old motorcycle guy.

1047
01:04:16.121 --> 01:04:19.960
I like how it's got at the,
you know,
I'll wait tires on it.
And he goes,

1048
01:04:19.961 --> 01:04:24.880
that's actually,
cause it was like,
uh,
uh,
one of the original motorcycles,
I guess,

1049
01:04:24.881 --> 01:04:29.110
where you couldn't even fucking stop the thing.
It just had to run out of gas.

1050
01:04:29.111 --> 01:04:31.420
You just turned it on and it just went full on.

1051
01:04:31.810 --> 01:04:35.890
And I guess the way to slow it down was you had to reach down and put your hand

1052
01:04:35.891 --> 01:04:40.150
over,
uh,
the carburetor or something.
Whatever the fuck.
Yeah.

1053
01:04:40.270 --> 01:04:43.600
With the air goes in the old,
is that what happens?
Oxygen and gas mixture.

1054
01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:45.010
He just put it over there.

1055
01:04:45.011 --> 01:04:48.350
You sort of smothered it and that's how you slowed it down.
But anyways,

1056
01:04:48.490 --> 01:04:50.050
these tires,
I know that's completely wrong.

1057
01:04:50.051 --> 01:04:54.040
So you fucking gear heads can trash man.
I don't give a fuck.
You doing a podcast,

1058
01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:57.850
you've got a podcast on how the original motorcycles run.
I didn't think you did.

1059
01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.470
So go fuck yourself.
All right.

1060
01:05:00.990 --> 01:05:04.720
Once you clean out under your nails so your wife doesn't get another fucking

1061
01:05:04.721 --> 01:05:09.580
infection,
that was brutal.
Um,
anyways,
when your finger blaster,

1062
01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:13.600
just to spell it out to the fucking nerds in the cubicles,
um,

1063
01:05:14.890 --> 01:05:15.820
how do I know that?

1064
01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:19.870
I forget how I know that I overheard a fucking dirty broad talking about that in

1065
01:05:19.871 --> 01:05:21.580
a bar one night.
Anyways.
Yeah,

1066
01:05:21.581 --> 01:05:25.240
I guess the original color of of rubber and its natural color is white.

1067
01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:29.440
I didn't know that.
So all these years when I was looking at white wall tires,

1068
01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:32.800
I thought that they just took like a strip of white paint or whatever and they

1069
01:05:32.801 --> 01:05:35.530
painted them white and the natural color of rubber was black

1070
01:05:37.230 --> 01:05:39.750
but it is white and you would think I would have noticed,

1071
01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:44.490
you know all the years of looking at cars that side swiped curbs,
you know,

1072
01:05:44.491 --> 01:05:47.070
and hacking up their tires.
It was always white underneath.

1073
01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:49.560
You'd think that I would have noticed but I never did.

1074
01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:52.650
So here's my question for all your gear heads out there.

1075
01:05:52.651 --> 01:05:54.030
Why did they paint it black?

1076
01:05:55.790 --> 01:06:00.290
<v 2>You know
anybody,</v>

1077
01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:03.920
I don't know.
Fucking know.

1078
01:06:05.130 --> 01:06:07.280
<v 10>Where am I going with this shit.
You know what that actually reminds me of?</v>

1079
01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:10.770
You ever see like when somebody dies on a bicycle and then they have that entire

1080
01:06:10.771 --> 01:06:14.280
ghost white bicycle that they have there,
that creepy one with the flowers.

1081
01:06:14.281 --> 01:06:18.210
I saw another one.
It absolutely gives me fucking chills.

1082
01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:21.870
It's my closest sixth sense moment that I'll ever have in my life.

1083
01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:22.950
When they do that,

1084
01:06:22.951 --> 01:06:27.951
I don't for the fucking life of me understand why they have to put the bike

1085
01:06:30.181 --> 01:06:34.740
there too.
You just can't put a reef down.
Why do they have to do the whole bike?

1086
01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:36.360
What is,
who started that?

1087
01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:39.810
I know I talked about this on the and Anthony show a couple of years ago,

1088
01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:44.690
but what the fuck?
It's still bugs me.
It just creeps me out that,

1089
01:06:44.691 --> 01:06:48.770
you know,
he was on a bike and he died.
They don't have like drunk drivers,

1090
01:06:49.710 --> 01:06:52.780
you know,
they smash into trees or you get hit by a drunk driver.

1091
01:06:52.781 --> 01:06:54.730
Do they frost out a fucking car,

1092
01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:56.720
<v 2>you know,</v>

1093
01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:59.750
<v 10>with a mannequin underneath it.
I,
that's a brutal job and I,
you know what I mean?</v>

1094
01:06:59.751 --> 01:07:04.730
It's just fucking creepy.
Fucking creepy.

1095
01:07:04.731 --> 01:07:08.500
Stop it.
Some of you know,
gets hit on a bicycle.
Leave a wreath.

1096
01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:13.270
They're like a normal person.
Fucking sit there.
Why don't you just put the bike?

1097
01:07:13.271 --> 01:07:15.760
He got hit on with a bent up tires and shit.

1098
01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:19.690
I knew it was going to be mean this week.
I'm tired and I'm fucking,

1099
01:07:19.691 --> 01:07:22.190
my Bruins lost four in a row.
All right,
let me,
uh,

1100
01:07:22.210 --> 01:07:26.560
try and get something positive here.
I'm literally in mayday,
mayday right now.

1101
01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:29.550
All right.
Hi,
Bill.
My fiance and,

1102
01:07:29.590 --> 01:07:32.680
and a couple of our friends saw you in Atlantic city this past Saturday.

1103
01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:35.890
You will be on hysterical.
I got a picture with you,
but Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah.

1104
01:07:36.130 --> 01:07:40.060
I recently quit my job as a photo retoucher for this high end retouching company

1105
01:07:40.510 --> 01:07:43.840
by my job was to make models thinner and more beautiful,

1106
01:07:43.841 --> 01:07:48.580
but also sit on my ass 10 to 12 hours per day,
like a robot.
It was brutal.

1107
01:07:48.581 --> 01:07:52.150
But what could help me through it was listening to your Monday morning podcast.

1108
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:54.790
I would sit there in a silent room hysterically laughing,

1109
01:07:55.150 --> 01:07:58.150
often needing to throw my headphones off because I was crying.

1110
01:07:58.151 --> 01:08:01.750
I was laughing so hard.
In fact,
they got in trouble once for laughing so much.

1111
01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:05.590
I needed to be more and people told me I needed to be more serious about my job

1112
01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:09.880
for thanks.
So thanks for doing what you do.
Uh,
well thank you.

1113
01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:14.890
I don't know why.
I saved that podcast,
but that email made me feel good.

1114
01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:16.251
And you know what,

1115
01:08:16.251 --> 01:08:19.670
I saved that before the Bruins lost four games at a fucking row.
So I was,

1116
01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:22.520
I was in a better mood.

1117
01:08:23.910 --> 01:08:24.180
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1118
01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:26.510
<v 10>All right,
let's read another one and see if I can get out of this.
I'm a really,</v>

1119
01:08:26.570 --> 01:08:29.780
really bombing right now.
Ah,
Bill.
Hi.
I love your work.

1120
01:08:29.781 --> 01:08:33.780
I don't know if you've covered this before,
uh,

1121
01:08:33.830 --> 01:08:36.720
as I found out about you.
Ah,
ah,

1122
01:08:36.970 --> 01:08:41.810
but what are your views on celebrity adoption?
I think I saw Sandra Bullock's,

1123
01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:44.570
uh,
has just done this,
but to be honest,

1124
01:08:44.571 --> 01:08:49.571
she doesn't have the profile or in or indeed now the father figure to really

1125
01:08:50.181 --> 01:08:53.810
pull off this adoption.
Seriously though.
I think it's sick.

1126
01:08:54.230 --> 01:08:58.250
They find the most fashionably deprived countries,
countries.
Oh my God.

1127
01:08:58.251 --> 01:09:02.420
I can't even read this week too.
All right bill,
come on.
Come on.

1128
01:09:02.690 --> 01:09:06.980
Get your shit together.
Right.
They find the most fashionably deprived countries.

1129
01:09:08.750 --> 01:09:09.980
Uh,
that doesn't even make sense.

1130
01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:13.700
Do you mean the most popular ones to give a fuck about?
Is that what you mean?

1131
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:17.630
They take the prettiest kid in the orphanage and then dress them up at the baby

1132
01:09:17.631 --> 01:09:20.420
gap and carry them around like a fucking Chihuahua.

1133
01:09:20.690 --> 01:09:25.690
It's like by absorbing them into this plastic la bullshit lifestyle,

1134
01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:29.840
they pretend they're actually doing something about the root cause of global

1135
01:09:29.841 --> 01:09:30.674
poverty.

1136
01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:35.680
When Angelina Jolie adopts a 56 year old Serbian war widow with a drinking

1137
01:09:35.811 --> 01:09:39.530
problem,
takes her to Disney world and lets her fuck Brad Pitt,

1138
01:09:39.830 --> 01:09:42.860
I might then buy it.
All right.
That's all hilarious.

1139
01:09:43.670 --> 01:09:46.790
Even though I didn't read it correctly.
But,
um,

1140
01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:49.561
um,
you know,

1141
01:09:49.561 --> 01:09:53.160
this is just this classic thing where do you ever notice when you do something

1142
01:09:53.161 --> 01:09:57.300
good?
If people find out about it,
they have to trash it on some level.
I mean,

1143
01:09:57.330 --> 01:10:01.950
you know,
I get what you're saying.
I've actually done bits about that.
Uh,

1144
01:10:01.951 --> 01:10:05.190
you know,
that they,
you know,
I actually did something about Paris Hilton,

1145
01:10:06.570 --> 01:10:11.040
something bedazzleing some out African kid make are making the kid match her

1146
01:10:11.041 --> 01:10:12.300
phone or something like that.

1147
01:10:12.301 --> 01:10:15.570
And she left it behind in a club was one of those topical jokes I don't think I

1148
01:10:15.571 --> 01:10:17.400
ever did on TV.
But,
uh,

1149
01:10:18.990 --> 01:10:20.710
she is kind of doing something about pocket.

1150
01:10:20.770 --> 01:10:22.680
You say she's not doing something about poverty.

1151
01:10:24.780 --> 01:10:28.470
She just took a kid who was in poverty.
All right,

1152
01:10:28.650 --> 01:10:30.390
I'm going to play the devil's advocate.
Okay.

1153
01:10:30.391 --> 01:10:34.470
And put him in a fucking house with running water and is now going to feed them.

1154
01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:38.250
You know,
I think a lot of times when people do good shit like this,

1155
01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:41.820
it annoys people because it reminds us that we're not doing shit about it.

1156
01:10:42.180 --> 01:10:45.960
Maybe that's why I make fun of them.
Or maybe it's that thing,
you know,

1157
01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:49.320
heathens pray in public so everybody can see our fucking holy there.

1158
01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:52.920
I don't understand why they can't just adopt the kid personally and just fucking

1159
01:10:52.921 --> 01:10:57.720
do it and then that's it.
You don't hold it up on the cover of people magazine.

1160
01:10:57.721 --> 01:11:01.740
Look,
now I'm agreeing with you.
I'm going to go a little skitzo on this one.
Yeah.

1161
01:11:01.741 --> 01:11:06.380
Sandra,
why do you get to hold the fucking thing up?
You know,

1162
01:11:08.150 --> 01:11:10.850
I don't fucking know,
but she is doing something about poverty.

1163
01:11:10.851 --> 01:11:12.260
That kid was fucking broke.

1164
01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:16.590
And I'm really sick of all you people who don't live in Los Angeles talking

1165
01:11:16.591 --> 01:11:18.450
about how plastic La is,

1166
01:11:18.451 --> 01:11:22.620
and then you're acting like nobody lies in nobody's full of shit in your fucking

1167
01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:26.040
hometown.
Just be honest.
They're better looking than you.

1168
01:11:26.190 --> 01:11:29.190
They have more money than you.
Okay.

1169
01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:34.170
And they're living the life that you fantasize about.
All right.

1170
01:11:35.130 --> 01:11:38.880
I'm man enough to admit that I was actually mad enough to move out here and have

1171
01:11:38.881 --> 01:11:42.510
the audacity to think that I could live that life on some level.

1172
01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:46.410
That's helper fucking pathetic.
I am.
Um,

1173
01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:49.530
look,
I gotta be honest with you.
If I ever did something like that,

1174
01:11:49.531 --> 01:11:53.160
I think it's a great thing to do.
You know,
I,
you know,

1175
01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:58.220
and considering the world is fucking overpopulated and where we're headed

1176
01:11:59.041 --> 01:12:04.041
towards major food shortages that nobody wants to deal with because everybody's,

1177
01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:07.080
you know,
I haven't had a boy yet,
so I'm going to try to have another kid,

1178
01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:10.710
or I haven't had a girl yet.
Someone tried to have another kid.
You know,

1179
01:12:10.750 --> 01:12:13.800
I read something about this guy in rolling stone today.

1180
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:15.630
I ain't know his fucking name,

1181
01:12:15.631 --> 01:12:19.230
but he's some legendary soul singer that I've never heard of.

1182
01:12:19.231 --> 01:12:21.870
So I don't think he's at legendary cause I think it would have heard about him.

1183
01:12:21.871 --> 01:12:25.740
I think when you're like,
seriously,
well I guess if he was an icon,

1184
01:12:25.741 --> 01:12:27.900
I would've heard about them.
Whatever.
I'll give it to him.
He's legendary.

1185
01:12:27.930 --> 01:12:32.930
The fucking guy had 21 kids who then spawned 90 grandchildren.

1186
01:12:35.130 --> 01:12:38.490
Um,
and you know,
I'm going to fucking call it first in the future.

1187
01:12:39.150 --> 01:12:42.240
That's going to be fucking considered illegal.

1188
01:12:43.410 --> 01:12:48.410
Like what that guy did is basically he had his own major fucking oil spill into

1189
01:12:51.721 --> 01:12:55.770
the ocean,
but rather than the ocean,
it was on land.

1190
01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:59.520
You know,
his fucking seaman

1191
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:04.500
would just fucking leaking out 5,000 gallons of fucking day,

1192
01:13:04.501 --> 01:13:07.770
just like that goddamn crater.
The bottom of the ocean.

1193
01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:13.890
You think he didn't just on a couple of ducks making 21 fucking kids.
They did.

1194
01:13:14.490 --> 01:13:19.490
That guy should be in fucking jail for that 21 fucking kids.

1195
01:13:22.150 --> 01:13:26.050
I mean,
you guys are at work.
Can you name 21 people you work with?

1196
01:13:26.051 --> 01:13:30.280
Can you imagine if that was your fucking kid?
21 kids.
He has 90 grandchildren.

1197
01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:31.780
There's no,
do you understand?

1198
01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:35.590
He doesn't know the names of all of his grandchildren.

1199
01:13:37.570 --> 01:13:41.200
Well,
maybe he does,
but in order to make room for that,

1200
01:13:41.201 --> 01:13:43.120
you'd have to forget half of your friends' names.

1201
01:13:44.170 --> 01:13:46.090
I know the names of 90 people with the fuck.

1202
01:13:46.091 --> 01:13:48.430
I probably know the names of 90 professional athletes.

1203
01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:51.910
I'm really underestimating the power of the human brain.
But what the fuck

1204
01:13:55.190 --> 01:14:00.190
one fucking guy's dick with two balls is far as we know,

1205
01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:07.370
created that,
that fucking ecological disaster.

1206
01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:12.010
You know what I love about rolling stone is,
is,
is,
is they actually got in,

1207
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:13.000
in that,
um,

1208
01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:17.800
in this week's issue where they have Keith Richards on the cover yet again,

1209
01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:20.720
you've got to love rolling stone every fucking three weeks.
If they're not,

1210
01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:24.730
just have some teeny bopper on there.
They're still mining the 60s.

1211
01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:30.760
The exile on Main Street reissue,
I love this shit were like,

1212
01:14:30.761 --> 01:14:34.000
the original artists were like back in the day were just like,

1213
01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:38.830
do you want to release this song now?
It sucks compared to the rest of the shit.

1214
01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:43.770
And then 40 fucking years later when you want to buy another yacht,

1215
01:14:43.771 --> 01:14:48.210
you start putting out shit that you didn't feel was worthy of releasing when you

1216
01:14:48.211 --> 01:14:49.080
were at your peak.

1217
01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:51.040
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1218
01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:55.420
<v 10>You know,
I don't fucking know that Tupac Shit that Jimi Hendrix Shit,</v>

1219
01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:57.640
the fucking,
uh,
I don't know.

1220
01:14:58.930 --> 01:15:03.430
There's very few that I can think of that they actually reissued that were

1221
01:15:03.431 --> 01:15:06.670
actually worth listening to.
I'll tell you one in recent years,

1222
01:15:06.671 --> 01:15:10.180
this past decade was led Zeppelin when they came out with that concert film of

1223
01:15:10.181 --> 01:15:13.420
them at Royal Albert Hall.
And um,

1224
01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:15.010
<v 4>okay.</v>

1225
01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:18.640
<v 10>You know,
all that concert footage.
That shit was great.
That actually</v>

1226
01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:23.430
was great stuff.
But they,
but they also weren't wow.
You guys,

1227
01:15:23.670 --> 01:15:25.560
red led Zeppelin is repackaged.
They act for them.

1228
01:15:25.561 --> 01:15:29.910
What the fuck am I talking about?
Every two years they,
they,
they have whatever,

1229
01:15:29.911 --> 01:15:34.911
10 years they do the new digital remaster of whole lot of love.

1230
01:15:34.921 --> 01:15:37.050
You know what I mean?
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

1231
01:15:37.051 --> 01:15:39.840
Talk about rolling stone.
Okay.
So getting back to that shit,

1232
01:15:39.841 --> 01:15:43.640
they actually do a story on this guy who's like,
um,

1233
01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:47.370
he goes into like,
you know,
war torn countries,

1234
01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:52.560
any like buys up land and he makes deals with basically war criminals or,

1235
01:15:54.010 --> 01:15:59.010
or whatever to buy up land because he knows that this unbelievable like,

1236
01:15:59.610 --> 01:16:00.443
um,

1237
01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:00.990
<v 4>yeah,</v>

1238
01:16:00.990 --> 01:16:03.510
<v 10>food crisis is common.
It's fucking scary.</v>

1239
01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:08.840
And this guy's out there having 21 goddamn kids who then go on to have 90

1240
01:16:08.911 --> 01:16:13.320
fucking grandchildren and uh,
you know,
it's the kind of shit that,
you know,

1241
01:16:13.390 --> 01:16:17.310
that like,
that's it.
Morning Talk,
show stuff,
you know,

1242
01:16:17.311 --> 01:16:21.630
like nobody would even even sit there and talk about how fucking reprehensible

1243
01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:26.420
that is.
I don't know.
Look,

1244
01:16:26.421 --> 01:16:30.080
I think I should get a tax break at my fucking age.
All right.

1245
01:16:31.590 --> 01:16:35.100
I had to be able to drive a full size fucking hummer with no muffler down the

1246
01:16:35.550 --> 01:16:40.260
Goddamn street.
The fact that I have not procreated and,
and just basically,

1247
01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:44.390
you know,
right now I'm,
I'm basically doing what people,
yeah.
Uh,

1248
01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:48.270
related to Hitler or doing,
I'm letting my bloodline die off

1249
01:16:50.490 --> 01:16:52.840
<v 12>if you guys ever heard of that shit.</v>

1250
01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:54.440
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1251
01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:56.870
<v 12>Then evidently the relatives of a,
you know,</v>

1252
01:16:56.871 --> 01:17:01.820
like his fucking great Greg grand nephews or whatever or whatever the fuck they

1253
01:17:01.821 --> 01:17:05.030
are.
There's evidently like two or three more left.

1254
01:17:05.031 --> 01:17:10.031
They live in Long Island and they all made a pact not get married and uh,

1255
01:17:13.390 --> 01:17:18.390
<v 10>and just let the bloodline die off because they're so afraid that whatever made</v>

1256
01:17:19.211 --> 01:17:22.990
Hitler so fucked up,
we'll let,
I mean they talking like some omen shit.

1257
01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:24.310
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1258
01:17:24.310 --> 01:17:25.060
<v 10>You know,</v>

1259
01:17:25.060 --> 01:17:28.840
like you'd be pushing your little baby Hitler on a swing and all of a sudden

1260
01:17:28.841 --> 01:17:32.910
your nanny's standing on a rooftop,
you know,

1261
01:17:32.911 --> 01:17:36.300
jumping off because like,
subliminally this little fucking kid told them to,

1262
01:17:36.301 --> 01:17:40.040
with this fucked up cute prepubescent prepubescent mustache.
Yeah.

1263
01:17:40.041 --> 01:17:41.490
I fucking hate this podcast.

1264
01:17:41.670 --> 01:17:44.550
I really would erase this thing if I wasn't 35 fucking minutes.

1265
01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:48.660
And I really would.
I really would,
but I can't because I can't,

1266
01:17:48.661 --> 01:17:51.310
I can't go through this fucking shit again.
I can't read this stuff.
All right.

1267
01:17:51.470 --> 01:17:54.570
Well anyway,
you know,
I can't remember what my fucking point was.
Look,

1268
01:17:54.571 --> 01:17:58.740
I think Sandra Bullock did a good thing.
Okay.
Uh,

1269
01:17:58.770 --> 01:18:01.020
why she did it.
I don't fucking know.
Okay.

1270
01:18:01.021 --> 01:18:03.060
But I'm going to give her the benefit of doubt that she did a good thing.

1271
01:18:03.061 --> 01:18:06.600
But just notice anytime anybody does something,
even remotely consider it.

1272
01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:09.770
Like how fucked up that makes people around him.

1273
01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:11.230
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1274
01:18:11.230 --> 01:18:13.450
<v 12>At no point did Sandra Bullock go,
I did this.</v>

1275
01:18:13.451 --> 01:18:16.570
You should do this to look what a great person I am.
Granted,

1276
01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:20.500
she's holding the fucking kid up like a Goddamn bowling trophy on people

1277
01:18:20.501 --> 01:18:23.350
magazine.
You know what?
You're fucking right.

1278
01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:27.690
But I kind of relate to her because,
yeah,
like when people find out,
I,
I,

1279
01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:30.430
when I first bought my Prius,
I got a ton of shit from people.

1280
01:18:31.290 --> 01:18:32.280
<v 10>What'd you do that for?</v>

1281
01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:35.160
Who Do you think you think you were actually making a difference?

1282
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.890
<v 12>You know,
like they got all fucking defensive.
I'm like,
dude,</v>

1283
01:18:37.891 --> 01:18:40.950
I'm not saying you can't drive with the fuck you drive.
I bought it from me.

1284
01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:44.880
I fly every other fucking weekend.
I put my own hole in the fucking ozone layer.

1285
01:18:44.970 --> 01:18:46.170
I'm trying to do something.

1286
01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:47.790
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1287
01:18:47.790 --> 01:18:51.510
<v 12>Something you know,
to not be a total douche.
Right.
That's all I'm doing here.</v>

1288
01:18:51.630 --> 01:18:53.250
I'm not saying you're doing anything wrong.

1289
01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:55.620
I'm not saying you can't drive a fucking car with a v eight.

1290
01:18:56.150 --> 01:18:57.000
I'll give a fuck what you do.

1291
01:18:57.001 --> 01:18:59.550
Get in your car and get away from me fucking asshole.

1292
01:19:01.150 --> 01:19:03.760
<v 10>Um,
I dunno.
So that's what I have to say about that.</v>

1293
01:19:03.761 --> 01:19:08.370
I don't know if it made any sense.
I don't know.
I got no idea.
Alright.
Right.

1294
01:19:08.620 --> 01:19:12.400
Here we go,
Bill Burr.
Well,
what do you want to ask me?
Ask Bill.
Um,
oh,

1295
01:19:12.401 --> 01:19:14.410
here's one for you.
I got it right here.

1296
01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:17.470
This is the one that's going to pull this fucking podcast out of the goddamn mud

1297
01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:20.740
bill.
I'm 21 years old and attend a big 10 university.

1298
01:19:21.010 --> 01:19:23.710
I'm not the best looking guy in the world,
but I think I'm,

1299
01:19:23.711 --> 01:19:28.600
what I lack in that department is made up with high amounts of intelligence and

1300
01:19:28.601 --> 01:19:29.980
charm.
Wow.

1301
01:19:30.010 --> 01:19:33.730
You just really sound like a sweaty fat guy with a lampshade on his head.

1302
01:19:33.731 --> 01:19:37.330
But I'm not going to judge.
Um,
that's another fat guy joke.

1303
01:19:38.170 --> 01:19:39.910
Maybe I do have something with,
I dunno.

1304
01:19:40.930 --> 01:19:41.490
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1305
01:19:41.490 --> 01:19:44.950
<v 10>You know what it is because I'm constantly in contact with those fucking people</v>

1306
01:19:45.850 --> 01:19:49.060
to Goddamn epidemic out there.
You know,

1307
01:19:49.270 --> 01:19:51.130
I had the ILC and uh,

1308
01:19:51.131 --> 01:19:54.010
I was back towards the back of the plane today and you know,

1309
01:19:54.011 --> 01:19:55.000
the aisle seats great.

1310
01:19:55.001 --> 01:19:57.880
You could stretch out a little bit when you want to get up and take a leak,

1311
01:19:57.881 --> 01:19:59.320
you don't have to step off of people.

1312
01:19:59.410 --> 01:20:01.300
There's a lot of fucking advantages to have in a,

1313
01:20:01.390 --> 01:20:04.090
but when you start getting towards the back of the plane and then becomes that

1314
01:20:04.091 --> 01:20:07.210
moment where everybody has to go to the bathroom and aligned develops.

1315
01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:11.070
The problem is,
is as these round people are trying to get past each other,

1316
01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:12.540
there's not enough room.

1317
01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:17.490
So what ends up happening is one of these douchebags stomach slash unit ends up

1318
01:20:17.491 --> 01:20:21.630
on your shoulder as they lean a little bit into your fucking airspace so the

1319
01:20:21.631 --> 01:20:22.980
other fatty can get by him.

1320
01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:26.930
It's fucking guy was enormous.

1321
01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:31.540
So the Goddamn plane to the point I felt like heat coming off of him.

1322
01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:35.110
Do you want to stand like how out of shape that is?
It was like,

1323
01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:36.850
<v 2>okay.</v>

1324
01:20:36.850 --> 01:20:40.930
<v 10>You know,
you could like,
like earth,
the planet,
fucking earth.
How the CCO,</v>

1325
01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:43.360
it's core is still on fire.

1326
01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:45.990
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1327
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:47.930
<v 10>All right.
I didn't,
I really didn't want to attack fat people get,</v>

1328
01:20:47.931 --> 01:20:50.940
I know I'm going to lay off.
I'm going to lay off for the rest of the podcast.

1329
01:20:50.941 --> 01:20:54.690
That's it.
That's it.
God bless you.
I know.
It's a problem.
I'm ruined for you.

1330
01:20:55.140 --> 01:20:58.470
Do the right thing and have a salad.
I got my problems still got me.

1331
01:20:59.520 --> 01:20:59.840
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1332
01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:04.220
<v 10>You know,
whatever.
All right,
here we go.
Uh,</v>

1333
01:21:04.310 --> 01:21:08.020
anyways,
you fucking try to get through this.
All right.

1334
01:21:08.021 --> 01:21:10.670
I'm not the best looking guy,
but oh boy.
Can I tell a joke?

1335
01:21:10.671 --> 01:21:13.280
I'm not just patting myself on the back there.
Uh,

1336
01:21:13.281 --> 01:21:15.770
there is a reason I'm stating it all right.
For the past two years,

1337
01:21:15.771 --> 01:21:18.650
I've been doing horribly in school.
Oh,
Jesus.
And I just trashed,

1338
01:21:18.651 --> 01:21:20.000
this guy's going to fucking kill himself.

1339
01:21:20.570 --> 01:21:23.600
I've been doing horribly in school dealing with things that are pretty

1340
01:21:23.601 --> 01:21:25.970
depressing.
But because of this,

1341
01:21:25.971 --> 01:21:30.971
I've had to come up with clever ways of trying to pass classes in an effort to

1342
01:21:31.641 --> 01:21:36.370
not get dropped from school.
Uh,
as such,
my strategy has been to pick,

1343
01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:41.900
uh,
teaching assistants that are females in order to try and charm my way into

1344
01:21:41.901 --> 01:21:46.901
passing the classes while putting in as little work as possible as I possibly

1345
01:21:47.031 --> 01:21:51.110
could do.
Do you have a future?
I'm gonna tell you this right now,
son.

1346
01:21:51.111 --> 01:21:53.420
Don't give up on yourself.
Do you have a fucking future?

1347
01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:58.580
If you've figured out a way to pass classes by doing that charming people while

1348
01:21:58.581 --> 01:22:00.080
doing little or no work,

1349
01:22:00.081 --> 01:22:03.770
I'm telling you there was a corner office waiting for you,

1350
01:22:04.730 --> 01:22:08.120
so don't,
don't give up on yourself.
All right,
here we go.

1351
01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:13.130
What the fuck am I?
Uh,
but EPA,
Dha a little work as possible.
Granted,

1352
01:22:13.131 --> 01:22:17.120
I am well aware that manipulating slash charming women into giving me good

1353
01:22:17.121 --> 01:22:21.200
grades is fucked up and not the most practical way of going about doing things,

1354
01:22:21.201 --> 01:22:24.590
but it fucking works.
Hey Dude,
they do that.
To get a free drink out of you.

1355
01:22:25.850 --> 01:22:29.480
You don't don't,
there's no shame in that fight.
Fire with fire.

1356
01:22:29.570 --> 01:22:31.520
I'm totally with this guy.
However,

1357
01:22:31.521 --> 01:22:36.290
my lack of foresight is very much evident now is something you probably saw

1358
01:22:36.291 --> 01:22:39.740
coming happened.
I fell hard for my ta,
this,

1359
01:22:39.741 --> 01:22:43.430
the teaching assistant this semester from day one.
I was attracted to her.

1360
01:22:43.490 --> 01:22:47.780
This is a good story so far.
How could this go off the rails?
Um,

1361
01:22:47.810 --> 01:22:51.440
let's continue.
And a while I do try and charm her.

1362
01:22:51.441 --> 01:22:53.390
Every chance I get in an odd way,

1363
01:22:53.391 --> 01:22:58.391
me being so attracted to to her has fueled my motivation to study and show off

1364
01:22:59.301 --> 01:23:03.230
the fact that I can easily ace or class.
I go every week to her

1365
01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:07.100
office hours.
I go to [inaudible],

1366
01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:11.460
I go every week to her office hours she holds for students,

1367
01:23:11.790 --> 01:23:14.060
which are about two hours and nobody ever goes.

1368
01:23:14.061 --> 01:23:18.480
So it ends up just being her and me flirting with one another the entire time.

1369
01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:21.420
However,
maybe it's uh,

1370
01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:24.630
because I'm a male or maybe it's because I'm so attracted to her,

1371
01:23:24.631 --> 01:23:28.260
but I didn't notice the huge wedding ring on her finger.

1372
01:23:28.260 --> 01:23:32.190
Oh geesh.
A,
we go,
everybody,

1373
01:23:33.010 --> 01:23:37.140
it's going this way again.
A lot of guys out there fucking do on a wrong turn.

1374
01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:38.071
All right?

1375
01:23:38.071 --> 01:23:41.640
But I didn't notice her huge wedding ring on her finger up until about a month

1376
01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:46.620
ago.
Uh,
I bet in a class now for about four months.
I brought it up to her saying,

1377
01:23:46.621 --> 01:23:48.030
Holy Shit,
you're married.

1378
01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:52.470
And her response is what holds my hopes.
Okay?

1379
01:23:52.471 --> 01:23:55.560
Before I get into her response,
dude,
you're full of shit.

1380
01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:59.140
There's no way for four fucking months you didn't notice her,

1381
01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:00.360
her fucking wedding ring.

1382
01:24:00.510 --> 01:24:03.990
This is you toning down the fact that you knew right out of the gate.

1383
01:24:03.991 --> 01:24:07.800
She was fucking married.
She had a huge wedding ring.
He didn't,
you didn't notice.

1384
01:24:09.270 --> 01:24:12.270
Okay,
maybe you're young,
maybe you don't look.
But how do you miss that?

1385
01:24:14.340 --> 01:24:16.710
And then you said,
Holy Shit,
you're,
you're married.

1386
01:24:18.030 --> 01:24:21.420
That sounds like a great setup line to get the response that you got.

1387
01:24:21.570 --> 01:24:26.010
So the guy says,
Holy Shit,
you're married,
Huh?
And she goes,

1388
01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:30.450
he goes in a response is what holds up my hopes in an astonish almost forgetful

1389
01:24:30.451 --> 01:24:34.380
way.
She replies.
Oh yeah.

1390
01:24:35.890 --> 01:24:36.723
<v 6>Wow.</v>

1391
01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:41.350
<v 10>Okay Dude,
you're in.
All right.
I'm not saying you should do it,
but if your,</v>

1392
01:24:41.351 --> 01:24:43.630
if your question is,
am I in,
you are in,

1393
01:24:45.570 --> 01:24:46.403
<v 6>mmm.</v>

1394
01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:50.170
<v 10>Since this revelation I have been continuing to bring up,
uh,</v>

1395
01:24:50.171 --> 01:24:54.580
as much as I can about her husband.
If nothing else for comparison.
All right.

1396
01:24:54.581 --> 01:24:56.560
This is getting twisted.
Dude.
Don't bring up her husband.

1397
01:24:56.561 --> 01:25:00.490
Just go in if you've got a bang or just fucking Banger,
you know.

1398
01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:04.840
Does he look good?
Better in a jacket that I do or do I look better?

1399
01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:08.200
The more I bring it up though,

1400
01:25:08.201 --> 01:25:11.530
the more it seems like she regrets getting married at such a young age.

1401
01:25:11.531 --> 01:25:14.980
She got married at 23 and now she's 25.
This is my predicament.

1402
01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:18.070
My parents got divorced when I was six because my bald,

1403
01:25:18.071 --> 01:25:22.240
childish fat piece of Shit.
Father cheated on my mother with their best friend.

1404
01:25:22.450 --> 01:25:25.630
So I have reservations about dating a married woman.
Uh,

1405
01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:28.570
doesn't sound that horrible while I'm trying to justify.

1406
01:25:29.860 --> 01:25:30.160
<v 6>Yeah,</v>

1407
01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:31.050
<v 10>it doesn't sound that horrible.</v>

1408
01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:33.680
While I'm trying to justify attempting to date a married woman.

1409
01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:35.930
But it's like you said,
what is it?

1410
01:25:35.931 --> 01:25:38.660
75% of marriages go right down the shitter right now.

1411
01:25:38.661 --> 01:25:43.310
I have no problem with waiting it out.
But I'll ask my question in two forms.
One,

1412
01:25:43.700 --> 01:25:47.780
what would you suggest doing to try and feel out the likelihood of this marriage

1413
01:25:47.781 --> 01:25:50.870
lasting?
And two,
if it's clear that it's not,

1414
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:56.120
which with not much prying done on my part is clear to see it won't.

1415
01:25:56.450 --> 01:26:00.410
What can I do to perhaps bring about the breakup as soon as possible?

1416
01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:06.290
All right,
dude,
these are the questions of a 21 year old.
Okay?
First of all,

1417
01:26:06.291 --> 01:26:10.070
you don't date a married woman,
all right?
You want to bang her,

1418
01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:10.911
go ahead and bang her.

1419
01:26:10.911 --> 01:26:15.911
She actually wants you to bang her because she needs some sort of spark to get

1420
01:26:17.331 --> 01:26:21.350
up her courage to get out of that fucking marriage that she clearly didn't want

1421
01:26:21.351 --> 01:26:26.120
to be.
And um,
I'm telling you right now,
as,
as she was walking down the aisle,

1422
01:26:26.150 --> 01:26:29.630
her brain was screaming,
what the fuck are you doing?
All right.
This is,
uh,

1423
01:26:29.690 --> 01:26:31.640
you know,
she got married at 23.

1424
01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:34.730
I don't know what our dating experience was before that.

1425
01:26:34.731 --> 01:26:36.140
Maybe she doesn't know how to get out of it.

1426
01:26:36.141 --> 01:26:40.850
She seems like someone who does not know how to get out of a relationship now

1427
01:26:40.851 --> 01:26:44.540
what kind of relationship she has.
It doesn't sound like an abusive one.

1428
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:48.860
It sounds like a,
I don't know.

1429
01:26:49.310 --> 01:26:52.580
She just got involved in something and then she just got into deep.

1430
01:26:52.850 --> 01:26:56.900
Didn't know how to get out of it.
That do what?
It met a family.

1431
01:26:56.901 --> 01:26:58.310
When are you getting married?

1432
01:26:58.311 --> 01:27:02.040
And she just fucking went down that fucking water slide.

1433
01:27:02.041 --> 01:27:07.040
She did not get off.
And now this is her deal.
So this is the deal,
dude.

1434
01:27:07.340 --> 01:27:10.400
You're going about this the wrong way.
I,
first of all,

1435
01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:13.400
you shouldn't fucking do it.
All right?

1436
01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:16.310
You shouldn't do it because you're,
you're,

1437
01:27:16.311 --> 01:27:18.500
you're dealing with the married fucking woman here.

1438
01:27:18.530 --> 01:27:22.760
There's somebody who wanted to spend the rest of his life with her.
All right?

1439
01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:27.860
And you're delving into that shit so you don't,
and you,

1440
01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:32.420
oh,
I'll tell you right now,
do you don't know what this girl's going to do,
okay?

1441
01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:35.450
She could be using you for the courage,
right?

1442
01:27:35.451 --> 01:27:40.451
Go out and fucking bang you all right now god damn rainstorm come home like a

1443
01:27:41.330 --> 01:27:45.680
drown fucking rat,
just so he can start the conversation and be like,
honey,

1444
01:27:45.710 --> 01:27:49.520
where the fuck have you been?
So she can just flip out and be like,

1445
01:27:49.521 --> 01:27:54.230
I just fucked one.
Am I students?
You know,

1446
01:27:54.380 --> 01:27:56.300
just so she could just get out.
Whatever.

1447
01:27:56.301 --> 01:27:58.370
How many fucking years she's been sitting on?

1448
01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:02.300
I don't want to be with you anymore.
All right?

1449
01:28:04.900 --> 01:28:08.710
And I'm telling you,
if you,
if you meet a psycho fucking woman,

1450
01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:13.950
they have a really bad fucking habit of doing something really fucked up with

1451
01:28:15.341 --> 01:28:17.590
the person that they're in a relationship with.

1452
01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:22.060
And then they feel guilty afterwards so they have to confess.

1453
01:28:23.950 --> 01:28:25.900
And then,
you know,
the guy can't hit the woman.

1454
01:28:25.901 --> 01:28:27.520
So guess who he's going to come and hit.

1455
01:28:28.570 --> 01:28:33.160
You know that you just blew up his fucking life.
So you shouldn't fuck this girl.

1456
01:28:33.161 --> 01:28:34.300
But I'm telling you right now,
dude,

1457
01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:37.150
if you're going to bang her just fucking Banger,

1458
01:28:37.330 --> 01:28:42.130
but you wanting to date a married fucking woman is completely the wrong fucking

1459
01:28:42.131 --> 01:28:42.964
thing to do.

1460
01:28:43.090 --> 01:28:45.640
I like I just gave you the green light to go ahead and bang her if you want,

1461
01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:46.833
you know?

1462
01:28:47.570 --> 01:28:47.860
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1463
01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:49.240
<v 10>I mean,
I'm not telling you to do that,</v>

1464
01:28:49.241 --> 01:28:52.840
but I'm telling if you're gonna choose one or the other,
he got three choices.

1465
01:28:52.841 --> 01:28:56.620
Don't fuck her.
That's what I'm telling you to do.
All right?

1466
01:28:57.250 --> 01:28:59.590
But if you're going to go with Defi,
going to go to the dark side,

1467
01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:04.230
there's Darth Vader and this Darth Vader light here.
Okay?

1468
01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:08.760
And I'm saying to,
to take the less calories of evil here,

1469
01:29:09.090 --> 01:29:12.900
what you should do is just try to bang out.
Do not try to date this girl,
okay?

1470
01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:15.540
This girl wasn't ready to date.
She doesn't know what the fuck she wants.

1471
01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:16.710
She shall she sold,

1472
01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:21.060
doesn't know what she wants and she show has so has an inability to communicate

1473
01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:22.440
what it is that she wants,

1474
01:29:22.441 --> 01:29:25.350
that she actually married somebody she doesn't want to be married to.

1475
01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:28.290
She's just sitting there with its screaming inside.

1476
01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:31.020
I don't want to maybe married to you.
I don't want to be married.

1477
01:29:31.021 --> 01:29:33.120
I don't even married at this point in my life.
I don't want to have kids.

1478
01:29:33.210 --> 01:29:36.410
I'm not ready for this.
I want to get the fuck outta here.
I want to,
I want,

1479
01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:37.613
you know what she needs to do.

1480
01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:41.820
She's bring up at this guy and go get an apartment and live by herself for a

1481
01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:44.670
good year and a half,
two fucking years,
you know,

1482
01:29:44.790 --> 01:29:49.770
and not really date anybody for a good six fucking months.
Cry this shit out.

1483
01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:52.410
Go to therapy,
figure out what's wrong with her.

1484
01:29:53.340 --> 01:29:56.220
Make a fucking list of what she wants in life.
She's got to do shit.

1485
01:29:56.250 --> 01:29:59.550
She needs to do that kind of work.
And you're trying to date this woman,

1486
01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:04.350
this fucking mess while she's still married.
Don't do it.
All right.

1487
01:30:04.351 --> 01:30:08.430
Go charmed the shit out of somebody else and try and bang them.

1488
01:30:08.431 --> 01:30:12.690
I'm telling you right now,
dude,
don't fucking do it.
Don't do it.
All right.

1489
01:30:13.710 --> 01:30:15.000
That's my advice to you.

1490
01:30:17.390 --> 01:30:18.223
<v 6>Uh,</v>

1491
01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:23.900
<v 10>that's it.
That's it.
That's all I gotta say on that.
Don't,
don't fucking banger.</v>

1492
01:30:23.930 --> 01:30:26.360
And if you do decide to Banger,

1493
01:30:27.170 --> 01:30:32.110
I mean you do decide to get with a do not fucking data,
okay?
Even,

1494
01:30:32.111 --> 01:30:33.110
even if I'm telling you,
dude,

1495
01:30:33.380 --> 01:30:36.590
you're gonna fucking probably make the wrong decision because you're young,

1496
01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:40.540
you're probably going to try and data cause you actually got feelings for all

1497
01:30:40.570 --> 01:30:41.403
right?

1498
01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:46.130
And then what she's gonna do is she's just going to use you to get over this

1499
01:30:46.131 --> 01:30:50.960
other guy before she dumps you and fucking rips your heart out of your goddamn

1500
01:30:51.470 --> 01:30:55.390
chest.
That's what the,
you're going to be roadkill.
All right?

1501
01:30:55.990 --> 01:31:00.790
Fortunately you haven't banged her yet.
You know,
all he got his feelings for.

1502
01:31:00.850 --> 01:31:02.230
So get out now.

1503
01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:07.060
Dial it down a sir class.
Get on with your fucking life.

1504
01:31:07.061 --> 01:31:11.670
There's plenty of other fucking teachers' assistants out there that you can bang

1505
01:31:11.670 --> 01:31:15.220
,
all right?
But that's,
that's not the move to make good luck to you.

1506
01:31:15.221 --> 01:31:19.960
It's your life.
You make your decisions.
But I'm telling you over and over again,

1507
01:31:19.961 --> 01:31:22.750
evidently I'm going to keep saying the same thing over and over again.

1508
01:31:22.751 --> 01:31:27.460
Do not cease and desist.
Fuck that.
Walk away.

1509
01:31:27.990 --> 01:31:30.370
Walk or do you know what?
You don't want that on your resume.
You just don't.

1510
01:31:30.850 --> 01:31:34.840
All right.
All right.
Trust me.
Okay,
here we go.
Ask Bill.
Uh,

1511
01:31:34.841 --> 01:31:39.430
this story is a little bit long.
Um,
but,
uh,
I was out with the clothes.
Oh,

1512
01:31:39.431 --> 01:31:43.480
Jesus.
Here's another one.
Oh,
Jesus.
Um,
the story's a bit long,

1513
01:31:43.481 --> 01:31:46.630
but in the end of your podcast,
but in the end,
oh,

1514
01:31:46.631 --> 01:31:49.420
this is this fist that actually an interesting one here.
Okay,
Bill,

1515
01:31:49.421 --> 01:31:53.710
this story's a bit long,
but in the end,
your podcast makes a girl cry.

1516
01:31:54.790 --> 01:31:57.850
Okay?
Somehow my podcast made a girl cry.
Okay,
here we go.

1517
01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:01.030
And I was out with a close and his girlfriend,
his girlfriend,

1518
01:32:01.060 --> 01:32:05.110
having some drinks and a five bottles of wine later,

1519
01:32:05.111 --> 01:32:10.060
my friends girl brings up a point about how pro athletes are overpaid.

1520
01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:15.040
I said a yes,
it is dumb to pay someone $8 million to catch a football.

1521
01:32:15.340 --> 01:32:19.600
But if you think about everything else,
it's,
it's,
it is deserved.
First off,

1522
01:32:19.601 --> 01:32:24.601
millions of people play plan there every Sunday around watching these athletes.

1523
01:32:25.030 --> 01:32:27.640
And since the industry is a gold mine for the owners,

1524
01:32:27.641 --> 01:32:31.510
the talent gets paid a pretty fair portion.
Secondly,

1525
01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:33.640
virtually every man in America,

1526
01:32:33.850 --> 01:32:36.760
his played organized sports at some point in their lives.

1527
01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:40.000
I think it's fair that you are,
if you are the absolute best,

1528
01:32:40.001 --> 01:32:42.730
it's something that every man has tried to do in their lives.

1529
01:32:42.731 --> 01:32:44.880
You should get paid.
Um,

1530
01:32:44.900 --> 01:32:48.460
this isn't the high score and that arcade game and your favorite pub.

1531
01:32:48.910 --> 01:32:53.410
Every man in America has put,
put some quarters in this,
in this one.

1532
01:32:55.130 --> 01:32:58.090
I don't know.
I think that was some of that left out or they just read that bad.

1533
01:32:58.091 --> 01:32:59.320
Anyway,
so I'm from that,

1534
01:32:59.321 --> 01:33:03.730
it quickly turned into an argument about the fact that pro women don't get paid

1535
01:33:03.731 --> 01:33:07.780
that much.
And that's where I bowed out.
I stopped and said,

1536
01:33:07.810 --> 01:33:12.340
Oh,
you're one of those girls.
I'm sorry,

1537
01:33:12.341 --> 01:33:16.000
but this conversation never goes well of Jesus.
Dude.

1538
01:33:16.001 --> 01:33:18.850
You're totally Batan or for a fight.
I love this guy.
Okay.
Uh,

1539
01:33:18.851 --> 01:33:23.560
she snapped back and said,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Say what you're gonna say now.

1540
01:33:23.780 --> 01:33:26.920
Come on.
You brought it up.
Fucking say it.
She didn't say all that,

1541
01:33:26.921 --> 01:33:31.690
but I know she did.
So he goes,
honestly,
I tried to avoid the issue.
No,
you didn't.

1542
01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:35.890
You baited her into it by saying,
Oh,
you're one of those girls.
I'm sorry,

1543
01:33:35.891 --> 01:33:40.000
but this conversation never goes.
Well,
a classic.

1544
01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:44.710
What do they call that?
We had you fucking you.
You do the reverse sell.
Yeah.

1545
01:33:44.711 --> 01:33:47.200
You don't want a car like this.
Then the,
the,
the,
the,
the,

1546
01:33:47.201 --> 01:33:52.030
the guy actually sells it himself.
Um,
oh,
there's my dog.
Cleo,
come over here.

1547
01:33:53.020 --> 01:33:57.490
Cleo.
Odo what's going on?
I just picked her up.

1548
01:33:58.180 --> 01:34:00.730
She was staying down at the dog.
He Super Eight.
Look at you.

1549
01:34:00.731 --> 01:34:05.080
They gave you a little high top fade.
Then you trimmed underneath the belly.

1550
01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:08.230
Huh?
What's up buddy?

1551
01:34:10.130 --> 01:34:15.130
You got anything to say?
Weak little exhale into the microphone.
All right,

1552
01:34:15.131 --> 01:34:17.950
here we go.
I fucking hate with a dog.
Does that

1553
01:34:20.210 --> 01:34:21.730
Lick my fucking toe?
It's weird.

1554
01:34:21.940 --> 01:34:25.060
It's creepy fucking moment that you're not happen between an animal and a human

1555
01:34:25.061 --> 01:34:28.450
being.
All right.
I'm continuing on.
Yes.
He basically,

1556
01:34:28.451 --> 01:34:30.700
you baited this one to a fight,
dude.
You know you did.

1557
01:34:30.910 --> 01:34:33.130
I know you did and I love you for it.
I think it's great.

1558
01:34:33.131 --> 01:34:35.380
I love arguing with women like this too.
So anyways,

1559
01:34:35.381 --> 01:34:40.060
let's continue on and I'm not buying your shit.
Honestly.
I tried to back out,

1560
01:34:40.750 --> 01:34:43.750
but she said,
say what you're going to say.
So he goes,
honestly,

1561
01:34:43.751 --> 01:34:48.700
I tried to avoid the issue.
Uh,
I did.
I will say that I am a bit of a massage.

1562
01:34:48.900 --> 01:34:52.810
A misogynist.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah,
Dude.
Okay.
I had no idea.

1563
01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:58.640
Uh,
but I know,
uh,
what not to get into feminists.
Um,

1564
01:34:58.670 --> 01:35:01.190
plus she's my friend's girl.
Ah,

1565
01:35:01.250 --> 01:35:04.160
this is getting ugly and you're drinking just can not end well.

1566
01:35:04.430 --> 01:35:07.310
But she forced me into the argument after she heard me say,

1567
01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:10.460
after she heard me say to my friend,

1568
01:35:10.461 --> 01:35:14.180
why am I arguing with the girl about sports?
Dude,

1569
01:35:14.290 --> 01:35:17.990
you'll be totally passive aggressive.
That's hilarious.
Let me guess.

1570
01:35:17.991 --> 01:35:20.000
You said it like three feet from her ear.

1571
01:35:20.900 --> 01:35:23.090
Why am I arguing with the girl about sports?
I mean,

1572
01:35:23.091 --> 01:35:25.820
they don't know shit about sports.
You know,
how did they just make me a sandwich?

1573
01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:29.060
And then they fucking,
they come back at you and you and you act like,
you know,

1574
01:35:29.061 --> 01:35:33.830
I tried to avoid it.
Okay,
here we go.
So I began,
it began,
here's the argument.

1575
01:35:34.190 --> 01:35:38.170
Uh,
she told me,
um,
I played high school,
thought Arthur,

1576
01:35:38.190 --> 01:35:39.650
I know sports.

1577
01:35:40.460 --> 01:35:44.600
This made me snap because she was bringing up high school credits to me,

1578
01:35:44.630 --> 01:35:49.250
which people really don't do around me.
Uh,
people don't do that around me,

1579
01:35:49.251 --> 01:35:50.960
I guess for good reason.
In high school,

1580
01:35:50.961 --> 01:35:53.960
I was ranked number one in the state for three different sports ranked

1581
01:35:53.961 --> 01:35:55.340
nationally and football.

1582
01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:59.420
I was inducted into the high school football hall of fame at the age of 21

1583
01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:03.920
played division one ball on a full scholarship and was projected to go seventh

1584
01:36:03.921 --> 01:36:08.840
in the draft until I blew my knee out.
I gotta ask you a question,
dude.

1585
01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:13.400
Blew me knee out.
Are you from like England?
We are playing footy.

1586
01:36:13.460 --> 01:36:14.990
We talking soccer over there.

1587
01:36:17.180 --> 01:36:19.120
At this point I thought you were like maybe that,

1588
01:36:19.121 --> 01:36:23.060
that guy that fucking running back there that went to buffalo from Ohio state.

1589
01:36:23.900 --> 01:36:28.090
Um,
no,
but he did go,
he did go number one in the first round.
Anyone.

1590
01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:30.080
He pretended to talk on a cell phone to a team,

1591
01:36:30.081 --> 01:36:34.610
but he was really talking to his agent.
The fuck was that guy's name.
Anyways.
Um,

1592
01:36:34.611 --> 01:36:38.770
I don't,
um,
Willis mcgahee.
All right,
continue bill.
Fine.
Um,

1593
01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:42.890
I don't bring this stuff up ever.
So she,
uh,
she might not have known,

1594
01:36:43.010 --> 01:36:46.220
but she baited me and I felt like putting her in her place.

1595
01:36:46.430 --> 01:36:49.640
I was starting to get arrogant but still making my point.

1596
01:36:49.670 --> 01:36:52.520
So you're basically telling her that you were ranked number one in three

1597
01:36:52.521 --> 01:36:55.160
different sports and you would have been seventh in the draft,

1598
01:36:55.250 --> 01:36:57.380
but you blow out your knee.
Dude,
I wish I was there to see that.

1599
01:36:57.920 --> 01:37:02.360
That's a great one.
I bet that shutter down.
Uh,

1600
01:37:02.361 --> 01:37:05.300
but she baited me and I felt like putting her in a place I was starting to get

1601
01:37:05.301 --> 01:37:09.450
arrogant.
No,
not you,
dude.
You're down to earth.
Um,

1602
01:37:09.470 --> 01:37:13.550
but still making my point of why sports are such a money grabber.
I said,

1603
01:37:13.551 --> 01:37:17.990
over 60,000 people come out every Saturday to uh,
every,

1604
01:37:17.991 --> 01:37:21.590
every over 60,000 people came out every Saturday to watch what me and my friends

1605
01:37:21.591 --> 01:37:24.230
do athletically and we weren't even getting paid.

1606
01:37:24.530 --> 01:37:28.540
She interrupted with I don't care.
Um,

1607
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:31.160
then she started talking about women's soccer against.

1608
01:37:31.161 --> 01:37:35.060
So I interrupted her by saying I have never played soccer in my life,

1609
01:37:35.061 --> 01:37:38.870
but I can guarantee you that I am better at it than you are.

1610
01:37:42.050 --> 01:37:42.470
Dude,

1611
01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:46.430
will you blue you like leaning over a table of coronas pointing in her face at

1612
01:37:46.431 --> 01:37:50.090
this,
at this point,
and are you much bigger than her than her,

1613
01:37:50.150 --> 01:37:54.830
her fucking boyfriend that he didn't try to step in?
Oh God,

1614
01:37:54.831 --> 01:37:59.370
I you fucking made this would've been a great youtube video.
Um,
anyways.

1615
01:37:59.371 --> 01:38:02.580
Now what I meant by that was I was probably twice as fast,

1616
01:38:02.610 --> 01:38:07.560
five times stronger and have enough natural coordination to pick up soccer and

1617
01:38:07.561 --> 01:38:12.030
be as good,
if not better at it than you,
because I'm a pretty high level athlete.

1618
01:38:12.510 --> 01:38:17.280
What she heard was all men are better at sports than ever than every woman.

1619
01:38:17.790 --> 01:38:18.990
She got emotional,

1620
01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:23.580
but her anger held back the tears while I was just trying to figure out,

1621
01:38:23.610 --> 01:38:26.850
while I was just trying to figure out how the conversation got to this point.

1622
01:38:27.390 --> 01:38:29.820
Well if you want to figure out how it got to that point,

1623
01:38:29.821 --> 01:38:33.480
let's start with your opening line of like,
oh,
you're one of those women.

1624
01:38:34.710 --> 01:38:38.100
I know enough not to get into an argument the with the fucking woman like you,

1625
01:38:38.370 --> 01:38:42.330
you know,
come on dude,
you baited her into it.

1626
01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:43.530
You obeyed it or into it.

1627
01:38:43.531 --> 01:38:48.180
You wanted to have the argument because you love yelling at women.

1628
01:38:48.390 --> 01:38:52.110
And I relate.
I'm not judging you.
Um,
you know,

1629
01:38:52.111 --> 01:38:55.410
it's not like you're on people magazine holding up the woman that you were

1630
01:38:55.411 --> 01:39:00.270
yelling at,
cause you just adopted her like Sandra Bullock.
Look what I did.

1631
01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:04.050
Um,
Ortho.
Yay.

1632
01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:08.870
Um,
she got emotional,
but I ain't going to help back on tears.
Well,
up,

1633
01:39:08.871 --> 01:39:13.350
up and up and up.
Finally my friends stepped in and I settled down.
Uh,

1634
01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:15.930
she just,
she got silent for a bit,

1635
01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:20.130
but she sparked back up when I brought up ed hardy shirts,

1636
01:39:20.670 --> 01:39:23.190
the ones that are so colorful and bedazzled and Warren,

1637
01:39:23.191 --> 01:39:27.300
a couple of sizes too small by dudes.
Uh,
she said I don't got it.

1638
01:39:27.330 --> 01:39:30.960
I don't get why guys wear stuff like that.
Girls don't like girls don't like it.

1639
01:39:31.410 --> 01:39:36.090
I came back as I came back and said as before,

1640
01:39:36.091 --> 01:39:40.860
I agree that the shirts are dumb,
but girls actually do love that shit dude.

1641
01:39:40.861 --> 01:39:44.220
You just love fucking pissing off women best what you do.

1642
01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:47.730
You're just arguing with this woman on every fucking point.

1643
01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:50.670
That's what you're doing.
Um,

1644
01:39:52.290 --> 01:39:55.470
and I think it's fucking hilarious cause I've done this.
I am this guy.

1645
01:39:56.430 --> 01:39:59.730
Did I write this?
Then I get drunk and send myself a fucking email.
Anyways,

1646
01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:00.593
she replied with,

1647
01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:04.140
are you going to tell me that you know more about girls than I do too?

1648
01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:10.160
Then I do also basically he said to which I said yes and he finally admits,

1649
01:40:11.311 --> 01:40:15.090
I think I was trying to fight at this point.
We were on bottles seven of wine.

1650
01:40:16.410 --> 01:40:20.520
Uh,
I said,
you obviously know more about what it's like to be a woman.

1651
01:40:22.020 --> 01:40:23.610
I'm sorry,
my screen just went blank.

1652
01:40:23.611 --> 01:40:26.430
You obviously know what more of what it's like to be a woman than me.
Yeah.

1653
01:40:26.431 --> 01:40:30.690
But figuring out what girls want in a man is our job as guys,

1654
01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:33.390
since I was 14,
I've been studying this shit.

1655
01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:36.720
I spent more time learning about girls in college than I did about my,

1656
01:40:36.810 --> 01:40:40.170
about my degree.
Uh,
she made some more dumb points,

1657
01:40:40.380 --> 01:40:44.160
mostly just angry at me saying,
well,
I don't like the shirts and I'm,

1658
01:40:44.450 --> 01:40:48.750
and I'm a girl.
So there you go.
Anyways,
uh,

1659
01:40:48.780 --> 01:40:53.010
you know how when you're drunk you get better at arguing,
but mercy,
worse at,

1660
01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:57.730
uh,
coming up with solid points.
I couldn't think of how to explain this to her,

1661
01:40:57.731 --> 01:41:02.230
but a classic bill,
Bill Burr Line came into my head.
I told her,

1662
01:41:02.231 --> 01:41:03.070
you don't get it.

1663
01:41:03.340 --> 01:41:07.480
Men literally have to develop a skill to get women to like them.

1664
01:41:09.010 --> 01:41:12.970
Uh,
and then he writes,
which is a great line by the way,

1665
01:41:13.180 --> 01:41:17.890
but I may have taken it too far and he goes on to say it's not love at first

1666
01:41:17.891 --> 01:41:20.560
sight and all that soulmate shit.

1667
01:41:21.130 --> 01:41:24.580
Men have to purposely take steps to get you separate.

1668
01:41:24.810 --> 01:41:28.060
Like to separate yourself from the crowd.
The feelings part,

1669
01:41:28.750 --> 01:41:30.940
the feelings part might be out of our hands.

1670
01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:33.550
But to set up those things is an easy,

1671
01:41:33.690 --> 01:41:36.130
and unless you're wearing some sparkly shirt,

1672
01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:40.240
most of my closest friends wear those shirts and trust me it works.

1673
01:41:40.450 --> 01:41:43.240
I'm not saying you're stupid.
Uh,
I may,

1674
01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:47.330
I may have said that part a little sarcastically core.
Shuer um,

1675
01:41:47.350 --> 01:41:49.870
but let's pretend that me and my friends have only ess,

1676
01:41:50.950 --> 01:41:54.340
but let's pretend that me and my friends have only slept with 50 girls each.

1677
01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:59.290
That means I've partly personally witnessed why over 300 girls have slept with

1678
01:41:59.291 --> 01:42:04.240
guys plus add up all the times.
We all stuck.
We all struck out.

1679
01:42:04.241 --> 01:42:09.040
And why?
I think I'm pretty experienced in knowing what girls like.
Um,

1680
01:42:09.070 --> 01:42:13.810
how many girls have,
have you convinced to fuck you?
Um,
this is when she cried.

1681
01:42:13.811 --> 01:42:15.790
What I didn't know was she used to be a lesbian.

1682
01:42:19.420 --> 01:42:23.740
She quit being a lesbian to be with my friend and she is sensitive about it.

1683
01:42:23.741 --> 01:42:25.630
Yeah.
I would think she would be sensitive about it.

1684
01:42:25.631 --> 01:42:29.800
Considering you can't quit being a lesbian,
you either are one or you aren't one.

1685
01:42:30.970 --> 01:42:34.960
Yeah.
You know,
I kind of blew a couple of guys but I quit.
Yeah.

1686
01:42:34.961 --> 01:42:39.580
I didn't like it made me paranoid.
Went back to vet Janie's.

1687
01:42:40.090 --> 01:42:43.300
Um,
anyways,
he said I became the I at that point I became the asshole.

1688
01:42:43.420 --> 01:42:47.530
I left a bar thinking two things.
One,
why did it have to shit?

1689
01:42:47.531 --> 01:42:51.880
I said come out with a Boston fucking accent.
And after realizing this,

1690
01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:55.120
uh,
after realizing the reason why I thought,
fuck,

1691
01:42:55.450 --> 01:42:58.180
I got to stop listening to the Goddamn podcast.

1692
01:42:59.590 --> 01:43:02.320
Can you believe this fucking guy?
I mean,

1693
01:43:02.350 --> 01:43:06.940
there must've been 22 off ramps he could have taken as that thing developed into

1694
01:43:06.941 --> 01:43:11.941
a major fight and he chose to stay on the highway and then in the end he comes

1695
01:43:12.701 --> 01:43:16.090
around and he tries to fucking blame me.
Dude.

1696
01:43:16.091 --> 01:43:20.300
The reason why you listened to this podcast is because you're just like me now

1697
01:43:20.301 --> 01:43:21.490
because I've created yeah,

1698
01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:26.880
<v 12>me inside of you.
All right the fuck dude.
Come on,
admit it.</v>

1699
01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:31.230
You like doing it.
I like doing it.
I love the women go in there and they,

1700
01:43:31.231 --> 01:43:35.370
and they,
and they make some stupid fucking statement.
I love at that point,

1701
01:43:35.730 --> 01:43:40.730
I love trashing them because so many guys just stand there and they just stay.

1702
01:43:41.070 --> 01:43:45.990
They just sit there and agree and they let them say stupid fucking things with

1703
01:43:45.991 --> 01:43:50.100
no points behind it because they're,
they're still in that adolescent.

1704
01:43:50.101 --> 01:43:52.130
Keep it happy.
It'll fuck me.

1705
01:43:52.820 --> 01:43:56.990
And it gets annoying and you just sit there and you watch one guy after another

1706
01:43:56.991 --> 01:44:01.910
getting played for free fucking drinks,
you know Carrie and shit for him,

1707
01:44:01.911 --> 01:44:06.020
helping him to move and it makes you fucking annoyed after awhile makes you

1708
01:44:06.021 --> 01:44:07.870
annoyed.
But uh,

1709
01:44:08.030 --> 01:44:11.180
then then what you do is you get involved in shit like that and you absolutely

1710
01:44:11.181 --> 01:44:13.730
bury him.
Let me ask you this dude,
how many times,

1711
01:44:13.860 --> 01:44:18.860
how many times were you fucking standing up pointing at her?
Huh?
Be Honest.

1712
01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:21.810
You know,
you even alluded to it yourself,

1713
01:44:21.900 --> 01:44:22.711
where you just sitting there going like,

1714
01:44:22.711 --> 01:44:26.460
maybe I said that a little sarcastically.
Of course you did.
Of course you did.

1715
01:44:27.450 --> 01:44:31.350
You know
whatever dude.
You know,
you fucking,
yeah,

1716
01:44:31.510 --> 01:44:33.430
you got issues with women sort of way.
Welcome.
Welcome.

1717
01:44:33.580 --> 01:44:38.550
Fucking join the Goddamn club.
Don't play make,
don't fucking blame me.

1718
01:44:38.580 --> 01:44:42.380
Go find out where the meeting is and then tell me where I can go with like a

1719
01:44:42.381 --> 01:44:47.080
couple of guys with,
with drinking problems.
So if you find out,
uh,

1720
01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:48.713
<v 4>yeah,</v>

1721
01:44:49.150 --> 01:44:50.920
<v 12>yeah,
I don't even think what you did was that bad.</v>

1722
01:44:52.340 --> 01:44:55.000
I don't think it justifies fucking crying either.

1723
01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:56.950
I think that whole thing is annoying.
You know what?

1724
01:44:56.951 --> 01:44:59.860
I'm going to stop this podcast here because it's already been over a fucking

1725
01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:02.320
hour and I know by the end of this I'm gonna end up agreeing with this fucking

1726
01:45:02.321 --> 01:45:05.740
guy,
which I don't want to do because this guy is me.

1727
01:45:05.860 --> 01:45:10.750
I'd say about 18 months ago,
I've actually made some strides.
Have an eye Cleo,

1728
01:45:10.780 --> 01:45:14.950
right?
I got a female dog,
didn't I?
I got a bitch laying at my feet.

1729
01:45:18.490 --> 01:45:21.490
All right.
Whatever.
There you go.
Another jet lag podcast.

1730
01:45:21.491 --> 01:45:25.540
Everybody congratulations to Philadelphia Flyers on fucking Poland for you guys.

1731
01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:29.070
It could be great to see you guys win a championship or even the fucking,
uh,

1732
01:45:29.770 --> 01:45:31.900
eastern conference finals.
God knows you'd be,

1733
01:45:32.110 --> 01:45:37.110
you'd be more better behaved than those assholes up in Montreal who burned down

1734
01:45:37.510 --> 01:45:39.310
their fucking city every time they win.

1735
01:45:39.860 --> 01:45:42.270
And then they look down on us because we're fat fucks.

1736
01:45:43.490 --> 01:45:46.370
At least we don't like shit on fire.
You fucking pyromaniac.

1737
01:45:47.590 --> 01:45:51.100
Granted we don't because some of so many of us are so flammable because of all

1738
01:45:51.101 --> 01:45:55.230
that fucking Lard we have inside of us went out.
What's up,
man?

1739
01:45:55.270 --> 01:45:58.690
I'm with a fat joke.
I like that people get hurt this week.
All right.

1740
01:45:58.691 --> 01:46:02.260
That's the podcast.
God bless all you and I will,
uh,
I'll talk to you next week.
