MARTIN AGUINIS: Hey everyone.

00:00:01.208 --> 00:00:03.310
I'm Martin Aguinis, and
this is Andrew Brogdon,

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.926
from the Flutter
team here at Google.

00:00:04.926 --> 00:00:07.300
And we're launching a video
series about Flutter Widgets.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:07.800
[BEEP]

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.470
What if we introduced
each other?

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:10.595
ANDREW BROGDON: Yeah, sure.

00:00:10.595 --> 00:00:11.386
MARTIN AGUINIS: OK.

00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:13.500
So this is Andrew Brogdon.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.367
ANDREW BROGDON: This
is Martin Aguinis.

00:00:15.367 --> 00:00:16.200
MARTIN AGUINIS: Yes.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:16.640
ANDREW BROGDON: Aguinis.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.330
MARTIN AGUINIS: Like the beer.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.030
ANDREW BROGDON: Yes.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.340
MARTIN AGUINIS: Yeah.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.890
And we're both at the
Flutter team here at Google,

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.420
and we're actually
about to launch

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.257
a video series about widgets.

00:00:25.257 --> 00:00:27.340
ANDREW BROGDON: Yeah, so
there's a lot of widgets.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.200
We're going to cover
some important ones--

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.420
InheritedWidgets,
Stateful widget,

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.802
Stateless widget, and Keys,
which are an ID for widgets.

00:00:34.802 --> 00:00:36.010
MARTIN AGUINIS: That's right.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.020
There's definitely going
to be a lot of surprises

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.394
in some of these videos as
well, so you should definitely

00:00:40.394 --> 00:00:41.560
stay tuned to check it out.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.760
ANDREW BROGDON: Yeah.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.110
