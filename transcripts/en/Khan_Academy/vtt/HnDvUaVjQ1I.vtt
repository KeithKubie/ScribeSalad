00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.750
So we've got a right
triangle drawn over here

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.720
where this base's length
is a, the height here is b,

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.540
and the length of
the hypotenuse is c.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.800
And we already know when
we see something like this,

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.341
we know from the
Pythagorean theorem,

00:00:13.341 --> 00:00:14.990
the relationship
between a, b, and c,

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.240
we know there's a
squared plus b squared

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.380
is going to be equal to
the hypotenuse squared,

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.040
is going to be
equal to c squared.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.490
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.650
explore how we can relate trig
functions to, essentially,

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.830
the Pythagorean theorem.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.800
And to do that, let's pick
one of these non-right angles.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.290
So let's pick this angle
right over here as theta,

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.775
and let's just think about
this what the sine of theta is

00:00:40.775 --> 00:00:42.760
and what the cosine
of theta is, and see

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.140
if we can mess with them a
little bit to somehow leverage

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.190
the Pythagorean theorem.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.010
So before we do that, let's
just write down sohcahtoa just

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.510
so we remember the definitions
of these trig functions.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.000
So sine is opposite
over hypotenuse.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.600
Cah, cosine is adjacent
over hypotenuse.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.030
And toa, tan is
opposite over adjacent,

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.920
we won't be using tan,
at least in this video.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.490
So let's think
about sine of theta.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.430
I will do it, I'll do
it in this blue color.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.240
So sine of theta is what?

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.880
It is opposite over
hypotenuse, so it

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.915
is equal to the
length of b or it

00:01:18.915 --> 00:01:21.870
is equal to b-- b
is the length-- b

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.850
over the length of the
hypotenuse, which is c.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.210
Now what is cosine of theta?

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.900
Well, the adjacent
side, the side

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.965
of this angle that is not the
hypotenuse, it has length a.

00:01:36.965 --> 00:01:38.590
So it's the length
of the adjacent side

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.510
over the length
of the hypotenuse.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.740
Now how could I
relate these things?

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.062
Well it seems like, if
I square sine of theta,

00:01:48.062 --> 00:01:49.520
then I'm going to
have sine squared

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.560
theta is equal to b
squared over c squared,

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.229
and cosine squared
theta is going

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.520
to be a squared over c squared.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.290
Seems like I might be able
to add them to get something

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.456
that's pretty close to the
Pythagorean theorem here.

00:01:58.456 --> 00:01:59.940
So let's try that out.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:06.530
So sine squared theta is equal
to b squared over c squared.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.835
I just squared both sides.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:19.990
Cosine squared theta is equal
to a squared over c squared.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.970
So what's this sum?

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.150
What's sine squared theta
plus cosine squared theta?

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.260
Is going to be equal to what?

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.920
Sine squared theta is b
squared over c squared,

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:49.210
plus a squared over
c squared, which

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.250
is going to be equal
to-- Well we have

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.894
a common denominator
of c squared.

00:02:53.894 --> 00:02:56.060
And the numerator, we have
b squared plus a squared.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.875
Now, what is b squared
plus a squared?

00:03:02.875 --> 00:03:04.250
Well, we have it
right over here,

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.750
Pythagorean theorem tells
us, b squared plus a squared

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.050
or a squared plus b squared is
going to be equal to c squared.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.572
So this numerator
simplifies to c squared.

00:03:12.572 --> 00:03:14.780
And the whole expression is
c squared over c squared,

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.840
which is just equal to 1.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.470
So using the sohcahtoa
definition, in a future video,

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.190
we'll use the unit
circle definition.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.900
But you see just
using the units,

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.970
just even using the sohcahtoa
definition of our trig

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.920
functions, we see probably
the most important

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.780
of all the trig identities.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.690
That the sine squared theta,
sine squared of an angle,

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.705
plus the cosine squared
of that same angle--

00:03:39.705 --> 00:03:45.500
I'm introducing
orange unnecessarily--

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.182
is going to be equal to 1.

00:03:47.182 --> 00:03:48.890
Now you might probably
be saying, OK Sal,

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.410
that's kind of cool, but
what's the big deal about this?

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.650
Why should I care about this?

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.670
Well, the big deal is now you
give me the sine of an angle

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.030
and I can solve this equation
for the cosine of that angle,

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.800
or vice versa.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.600
So this is actually a pretty
powerful, powerful thing.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.160
And this is also part
of the motivation

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.336
even for the unit circle
definition of trig functions.
