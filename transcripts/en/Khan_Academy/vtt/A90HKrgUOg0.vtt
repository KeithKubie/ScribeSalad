00:00:00.305 --> 00:00:03.788
- There are all sorts of
reactions in biological systems

00:00:03.788 --> 00:00:06.442
that are energetically favorable,

00:00:06.442 --> 00:00:08.563
but they're still not
going to happen quickly

00:00:08.563 --> 00:00:10.596
or even happen on their own,

00:00:10.596 --> 00:00:13.679
and the phosphorylation of
glucose is an example of that.

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.671
We go into some detail into that

00:00:15.671 --> 00:00:18.210
on the video on coupled reactions,

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.366
and I think we actually called that

00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:21.989
The Phosphorylation of
Glucose 6-Phosphate,

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:23.564
but it's super important because

00:00:23.564 --> 00:00:25.568
by putting the phosphate
group on a glucose,

00:00:25.568 --> 00:00:27.037
it's ready to be the input

00:00:27.037 --> 00:00:30.679
to a whole series of
biological mechanisms,

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:32.485
it allows the glucose to be tagged

00:00:32.485 --> 00:00:35.184
so it's going to be hard for
it to escape the cell again,

00:00:35.184 --> 00:00:38.530
and it's fairly straightforward mechanism,

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.090
where you have a lone pair of electrons

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.839
on this hydroxyl group right over here,

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:48.859
and then it attempts to, if
it's in the right configuration,

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:51.555
it could form a bond with the phosphorus

00:00:51.555 --> 00:00:52.898
in the phosphate group.

00:00:52.898 --> 00:00:54.748
Now, the reason why it
doesn't happen on its own,

00:00:54.748 --> 00:00:56.311
even though it's energetically favorable,

00:00:56.311 --> 00:00:58.234
once you form the bond, you have,

00:00:58.234 --> 00:01:01.519
electrons are gonna be able
to go to a lower energy state.

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.056
So it has a negative delta G.

00:01:04.056 --> 00:01:07.993
If this is the molecules
before the reaction,

00:01:07.993 --> 00:01:10.507
this is how much free energy
they have before the reaction,

00:01:10.507 --> 00:01:12.718
after the reaction, they
have less free energy,

00:01:12.718 --> 00:01:15.499
they have been able to release energy,

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:17.028
so this is something
that we would consider

00:01:17.028 --> 00:01:20.588
to be spontaneous, but for
the reaction to happen,

00:01:20.588 --> 00:01:23.629
you need a little bit of energy
to be put into the system.

00:01:23.629 --> 00:01:25.579
We call this our activation energy.

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:27.553
You might say, "Well, why is that?"

00:01:27.553 --> 00:01:29.622
Well, we have electrons
that want to form a bond

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:30.813
with this phosphorus,

00:01:30.813 --> 00:01:33.437
but this phosphorus is
surrounded by negative charges.

00:01:33.437 --> 00:01:36.432
This oxygen right over
here has a negative charge.

00:01:36.432 --> 00:01:39.903
This oxygen right over
here has a negative charge,

00:01:39.903 --> 00:01:41.760
and as you can imagine,
electrons don't like

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.296
being around other electrons,
like charges repel each other,

00:01:45.296 --> 00:01:47.932
so in order for this reaction to occur,

00:01:47.932 --> 00:01:50.555
or for it to occur more frequently,

00:01:50.555 --> 00:01:52.553
it has to be catalyzed.

00:01:52.553 --> 00:01:55.841
A catalyst is anything that
makes a reaction happen faster,

00:01:55.841 --> 00:01:58.940
or even allows the
reaction to happen at all,

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.936
and when we talk about
catalysts in biological systems,

00:02:01.936 --> 00:02:03.835
we're typically talking about,

00:02:03.835 --> 00:02:06.832
we're typically talking about Enzymes.

00:02:06.832 --> 00:02:08.271
Enzymes.

00:02:08.271 --> 00:02:11.882
And the way that an Enzyme
might catalyze this reaction,

00:02:11.882 --> 00:02:13.147
we actually talk about it,

00:02:13.147 --> 00:02:16.021
and when we talk about coupled reactions,

00:02:16.021 --> 00:02:18.790
it'll maybe can provide
some positive charges.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.027
It could provide some positive charges

00:02:21.027 --> 00:02:25.426
around these negative charges
to pull them further away

00:02:25.426 --> 00:02:27.975
to create space

00:02:27.975 --> 00:02:30.935
so that you can actually
have the reaction proceed,

00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:32.498
and so what an Enzyme would do,

00:02:32.498 --> 00:02:34.896
it would make this curve, instead
of having this hump on it,

00:02:34.896 --> 00:02:37.182
the curve would more like this,

00:02:37.182 --> 00:02:41.258
so that the reaction can just proceed.

00:02:41.258 --> 00:02:42.940
But what are these Enzymes?

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.332
These things that can maybe,

00:02:45.332 --> 00:02:47.388
it could place some interesting charge

00:02:47.388 --> 00:02:50.235
that can allow the reaction
to happen a certain way,

00:02:50.235 --> 00:02:52.915
it might bend the
molecules in a certain way

00:02:52.915 --> 00:02:55.830
to expose some bonds,

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.370
it might have a more
acidic or basic environment

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.435
that might be more
favorable for the reaction.

00:03:02.435 --> 00:03:05.546
What are these seemingly magical things?

00:03:05.546 --> 00:03:08.008
Well, at a very high
level, they tend to be

00:03:08.008 --> 00:03:11.018
these protein complexes, plus
or minus a few other things,

00:03:11.018 --> 00:03:14.545
so you can view them as proteins and

00:03:14.545 --> 00:03:18.549
maybe sometimes, they'll be
multiple polypeptide chains

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.316
put together, they might have some other

00:03:20.316 --> 00:03:22.917
ions associated with them,
but for the most part,

00:03:22.917 --> 00:03:25.816
they are proteins, and the molecules

00:03:25.816 --> 00:03:27.254
that are going to react,

00:03:27.254 --> 00:03:29.729
that are going to bind to the proteins,

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:32.127
we call these the Substrates.

00:03:32.127 --> 00:03:35.134
So these, and this
reaction, (mumbles) glucose

00:03:35.134 --> 00:03:39.635
and the ATP, these are
going to be the Substrates.

00:03:39.855 --> 00:03:42.260
So you can imagine

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.392
the Enzyme that does this,

00:03:43.392 --> 00:03:44.997
and the general term for the Enzyme

00:03:44.997 --> 00:03:49.462
that helps phosphorylate a
sugar molecule like this,

00:03:49.462 --> 00:03:51.294
we call it hexokinase.

00:03:51.294 --> 00:03:53.589
So it might be this crazy-looking,

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:55.620
this crazy-looking protein, we're gonna

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.598
take better looks at
this in a few moments,

00:03:58.598 --> 00:04:02.030
but the ATP might bind

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.181
to it right over there.

00:04:03.181 --> 00:04:05.596
ATP is one of the Substrates,

00:04:05.596 --> 00:04:08.772
and then the glucose might bind

00:04:08.772 --> 00:04:10.351
to it right over there,

00:04:10.351 --> 00:04:12.947
and so these two Substrates bind,

00:04:12.947 --> 00:04:15.071
and the area where all
of this is going on,

00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:17.191
we call that the Active Site.

00:04:17.191 --> 00:04:20.854
So the Active Site, because
that's where all the action is,

00:04:20.854 --> 00:04:22.933
the Active Site.

00:04:22.933 --> 00:04:25.829
And often, when you have
the Substrates bind,

00:04:25.829 --> 00:04:28.314
they're able to interact with the protein

00:04:28.314 --> 00:04:30.591
to make the fit even stronger,

00:04:30.591 --> 00:04:32.192
to make it even more,

00:04:34.142 --> 00:04:37.226
more suitable for the
reaction to take place,

00:04:37.226 --> 00:04:40.233
and so the whole protein
might bend a little bit

00:04:40.233 --> 00:04:42.632
to kind of lock these two
in place a little bit more,

00:04:42.632 --> 00:04:44.892
and we call that Induced fit.

00:04:44.892 --> 00:04:48.537
Induced fit.

00:04:48.537 --> 00:04:51.165
And so, where would these
positive charges come from?

00:04:51.165 --> 00:04:53.661
Well these would be things
that are the side chains

00:04:53.661 --> 00:04:57.094
of the different amino
acids on the actual,

00:04:57.094 --> 00:05:00.101
on the polypeptide chain on the protein,

00:05:00.101 --> 00:05:02.180
and it could even be other
ions that get involved,

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.859
in fact, in particular,

00:05:03.859 --> 00:05:06.078
to facilitate the
phosphorylation of glucose,

00:05:06.078 --> 00:05:08.688
a magnesium ion might be involved

00:05:08.688 --> 00:05:10.463
to help draw some positive charge away,

00:05:10.463 --> 00:05:12.940
but there's other
positively charged groups

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.533
that help draw charge
away so that the reaction

00:05:15.533 --> 00:05:18.424
is more likely to occur.

00:05:18.424 --> 00:05:21.122
So that's what enzymes
are, and they tend to be

00:05:21.122 --> 00:05:23.691
optimally working in
certain pH environments

00:05:23.691 --> 00:05:25.096
or certain temperatures.

00:05:25.096 --> 00:05:28.165
In general, the higher temperatures
allow more interactions,

00:05:28.165 --> 00:05:29.307
things are bumping around more,

00:05:29.307 --> 00:05:31.559
but if temperatures get
a little bit too high,

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:33.688
the protein or the Enzyme
might stop working,

00:05:33.688 --> 00:05:34.679
it might denature,

00:05:34.679 --> 00:05:39.118
it might lose its actual structure.

00:05:39.118 --> 00:05:41.188
And what I want now give
you an appreciation for

00:05:41.188 --> 00:05:44.485
is how beautiful and complex
these structures are.

00:05:44.485 --> 00:05:45.922
You should appreciate
what I'm showing you.

00:05:45.922 --> 00:05:47.134
These are in your cells!

00:05:47.134 --> 00:05:49.570
These are in your,

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.413
look at your hand, look at

00:05:51.413 --> 00:05:53.925
everything around you,
there's a lot of this stuff

00:05:53.925 --> 00:05:56.386
going on inside of you,
so hopefully it gives

00:05:56.386 --> 00:05:58.341
an appreciation for the complexity

00:05:58.341 --> 00:06:00.558
of you as a biological
system, but frankly,

00:06:00.558 --> 00:06:02.024
all biological systems.

00:06:02.024 --> 00:06:04.474
So this right over here,
this is a visualization

00:06:04.474 --> 00:06:07.469
of a hexokinase, one variety of it,

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:09.164
and just to get a sense of scale,

00:06:09.164 --> 00:06:11.485
this is a glucose molecule,

00:06:11.485 --> 00:06:14.125
and this right over here is an ATP,

00:06:14.125 --> 00:06:16.927
and so they will bind, these
are the two Substrates,

00:06:16.927 --> 00:06:19.226
they will bind at the Active Site.

00:06:19.226 --> 00:06:22.349
You might have the Induced
fit, where this fits around it.

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:23.619
It draws some charge away,

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:25.999
it might bend the
molecules in a certain way

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:28.865
so that they're more likely to interact,

00:06:28.865 --> 00:06:30.526
bring these things close together,

00:06:30.526 --> 00:06:31.994
and so you're gonna
have the reaction occur

00:06:31.994 --> 00:06:33.596
and then once the reaction occurs,

00:06:33.596 --> 00:06:36.523
they're not gonna want to bind
to the Substrates anymore.

00:06:36.523 --> 00:06:38.652
I guess you could say the
products, at that point,

00:06:38.652 --> 00:06:40.134
and then they're gonna let go of them,

00:06:40.134 --> 00:06:41.625
and then the Enzyme has a change,

00:06:41.625 --> 00:06:43.161
and that's an important
property of an Enzyme.

00:06:43.161 --> 00:06:45.495
It's not like it just has
one use and it goes away,

00:06:45.495 --> 00:06:48.389
it can keep doing this over
and over and over again.

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:52.411
One Enzyme will do this many,
many, many, many, many times

00:06:52.411 --> 00:06:54.082
in its actual life.

00:06:54.082 --> 00:06:55.599
And so now what I want
to show you is a little

00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:58.502
three-dimensional visualization
that I got from a website,

00:06:58.502 --> 00:07:00.468
so let me go get that.

00:07:00.468 --> 00:07:01.610
Go ahead and pause my recording

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.485
so I could get to this little
simulation or this model,

00:07:05.485 --> 00:07:07.962
and this is actually a hexokinase as well,

00:07:07.962 --> 00:07:09.372
and hexokinase is come into,

00:07:09.372 --> 00:07:11.670
in a bunch of different varieties,

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:13.091
but this is a pretty neat thing to look at

00:07:13.091 --> 00:07:15.157
and this has been visualized differently,

00:07:15.157 --> 00:07:17.249
and when you look up
protein images on the web,

00:07:17.249 --> 00:07:18.901
or anywhere, you'll see them sometimes

00:07:18.901 --> 00:07:20.368
with these ball and stick models,

00:07:20.368 --> 00:07:22.880
sometimes you'll see them in
these space-filling model,

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.603
sometimes you'll see
them with this kind of,

00:07:24.603 --> 00:07:26.025
where you the very structures,

00:07:26.025 --> 00:07:28.892
and you notice the alpha helices here

00:07:28.892 --> 00:07:31.306
that we studied when we talked
about protein structures,

00:07:31.306 --> 00:07:33.175
and you can also see some beta sheets,

00:07:33.175 --> 00:07:34.928
but this gives you an appreciation of

00:07:34.928 --> 00:07:37.691
the binding sites and how
these things might interact.

00:07:37.691 --> 00:07:38.681
This right over here,

00:07:38.681 --> 00:07:40.996
that is a molecule of ATP,

00:07:40.996 --> 00:07:43.067
and then right next to it, I believe,

00:07:43.067 --> 00:07:45.806
if I'm looking at that right,
that is a molecule of glucose,

00:07:45.806 --> 00:07:48.352
and notice they have bound,

00:07:48.352 --> 00:07:49.632
they are the two Substrates,

00:07:49.632 --> 00:07:52.023
they have bound at the Active Site,

00:07:52.023 --> 00:07:54.370
and now, they can
interact with each other,

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:57.441
the Enzyme, the hexokinase in this case,

00:07:57.441 --> 00:08:00.065
can help facilitate the
reaction that we care about,

00:08:00.065 --> 00:08:02.298
the phosphorylation of glucose.

00:08:02.298 --> 00:08:05.236
So hopefully, images
like this, and like this,

00:08:05.236 --> 00:08:07.330
give you an appreciation for how complex

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:11.099
and how beautiful these
things actually are.
