00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.399
 welcome to 

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:07.600
 to the floating islands of Lake Titicaca 

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:07.600
 from puno peru 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:18.100
 but there what happens is there's a lot 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.590
 rain 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.770
 they are a bit adrift and there 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:26.830
 problems then the cigars decide 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.380
 move here to one a place where 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:34.410
 could be with more security more 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.410
 before we lived a little more 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.410
 it can be being more errant they are more 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.380
 undisturbed 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:50.300
 on the point the tourists the agencies 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:54.240
 they start to take tourists home 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.970
 then we feel the need 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.760
 we have you tourists who visit us 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.370
 as we are doing now we are not going 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.830
 to explain our identity they 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.790
 they would go outside to look for work employment 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:12.560
 but now as there was more tourism 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:16.000
 then it was convenient for them to return 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.829
 so she always thought that 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.270
 I only had the opportunity in the 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:22.159
 city 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.230
 then when they knocked on the doors 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.330
 then more 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.920
 because seeing the new equipment changed with 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.140
 tourism can do many things 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.510
 you can work now too now 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.550
 study at the university 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:40.010
 then they are studying many have 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.010
 started studying tourism has studied 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:46.420
 things but in these 50 years has not 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:50.380
 changed suddenly in our life but 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.750
 they are linked because they are not 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.640
 the fact that they have a profession 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.010
 they have disconnected from them continue 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.560
 fishing they are still hunting 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:03.280
 collecting eggs his life as pure 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:06.460
 this is still the same then it is very 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.120
 important why that says possibly 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.120
 from achilles 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.690
 can go to work 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:24.420
 talk value more culture 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:28.760
 what is the truth not because sometimes not 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.760
 comes from outside does not know the reality 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.959
 but no 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.819
 symbol of freedom and in those of saving 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.470
 is we resist to disappear 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.060
 now 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:54.040
 they are all wrong 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.040
 we still all want 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:03.310
 before his destiny he was in the hands of 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:06.520
 travel agencies and other people 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.840
 now they are starting to become more 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.710
 owners of your destination 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.750
 they start to have 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.750
 feel more proud of being pure 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.790
