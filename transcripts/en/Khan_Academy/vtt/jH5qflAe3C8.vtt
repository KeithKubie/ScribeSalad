00:00:00.471 --> 00:00:01.560
- [Voiceover] Let's now actually apply

00:00:01.056 --> 00:00:02.377
Newton's Law of Cooling.

00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:05.939
Just to remind ourselves, if
capitol T is the temperature

00:00:06.461 --> 00:00:08.009
of something in celsius degrees,

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:10.070
and lower case t is time in minutes,

00:00:10.007 --> 00:00:13.951
we can say that the rate of change,

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:16.017
the rate of change of our temperature

00:00:16.017 --> 00:00:17.840
with respect to time,

00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:18.146
is going to be proportional

00:00:19.046 --> 00:00:20.807
and I'll write a negative K over here.

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:22.932
We assumed our concept K is positive,

00:00:22.932 --> 00:00:27.932
then a negative K is going to
proportional to the difference

00:00:28.554 --> 00:00:32.397
between the temperature of our thing

00:00:32.397 --> 00:00:35.846
and the ambient temperature in the room.

00:00:35.846 --> 00:00:37.353
Once again, why do I
have a negative there?

00:00:37.353 --> 00:00:38.904
Well, because if the
temperature of our thing

00:00:38.904 --> 00:00:41.015
is larger than the
temperature of our room,

00:00:41.015 --> 00:00:44.263
we would expect that we would
be decreasing in temperature.

00:00:44.263 --> 00:00:46.417
We would have a negative rate of chance.

00:00:46.417 --> 00:00:48.453
Temperature should be
decreasing over time.

00:00:48.453 --> 00:00:51.509
If, on the other hand,
our temperature is lower

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:53.511
than the ambient temperature of the room

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:55.071
then this thing is going to be negative

00:00:55.071 --> 00:00:57.966
and we would want a
positive rate of change.

00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:59.264
Things would be warming up.

00:00:59.264 --> 00:01:01.086
That's why a negative of a negative

00:01:01.086 --> 00:01:02.927
would give you the positive.

00:01:02.927 --> 00:01:03.992
This right over here, this
differential equation,

00:01:04.577 --> 00:01:06.043
we already saw it in a previous video

00:01:06.043 --> 00:01:08.121
on Newton's Law of Cooling.

00:01:08.121 --> 00:01:10.916
We even saw a general solution to that.

00:01:10.916 --> 00:01:13.022
The general solution that I care about,

00:01:13.022 --> 00:01:14.756
because we are now going
to deal with the scenario

00:01:14.756 --> 00:01:17.443
where we are putting
something warm in a...

00:01:17.443 --> 00:01:19.929
Or we are going to put
a warm bowl of oatmeal

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:22.983
in a room temperature room.

00:01:23.662 --> 00:01:25.234
Given that, we are
going to assume the case

00:01:25.234 --> 00:01:26.573
that we saw in the last video

00:01:26.573 --> 00:01:30.575
where our temperature is
greater than or equal to

00:01:30.593 --> 00:01:31.666
the ambient temperature.

00:01:32.323 --> 00:01:37.323
In that situation, our general
solution boiled down to...

00:01:37.888 --> 00:01:42.814
It boiled down to temperature
as a function of time

00:01:42.814 --> 00:01:47.814
is equal to some constant
times e to the negative KT,

00:01:51.222 --> 00:01:55.580
negative KT, plus our ambient temperature.

00:01:55.058 --> 00:01:57.231
Plus our ambient temperature.

00:01:57.753 --> 00:02:00.318
Once again, we figured
this out in our last video.

00:02:00.318 --> 00:02:01.740
Now, let's actually apply it.

00:02:01.074 --> 00:02:02.880
I said we were dealing with the scenario

00:02:03.546 --> 00:02:04.977
where our temperature is greater than

00:02:04.977 --> 00:02:06.418
or equal to the ambient temperature.

00:02:06.418 --> 00:02:08.884
Let's assume we are in a scenario...

00:02:08.884 --> 00:02:10.600
Let's assume a scenario where

00:02:10.006 --> 00:02:13.122
our ambient temperature
is 20 degrees celsius.

00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:14.730
We assume that doesn't change.

00:02:14.856 --> 00:02:16.879
The room is just large enough that even if

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.453
something that is warmer is put into it

00:02:19.453 --> 00:02:22.264
the ambient temperature does not change.

00:02:22.782 --> 00:02:25.057
Let's say that the thing
that we have put in it,

00:02:25.057 --> 00:02:27.964
our warm bowl of oatmeal,

00:02:27.964 --> 00:02:29.997
let's say it starts off the
moment we put it in the room,

00:02:29.997 --> 00:02:31.865
that time equals zero,

00:02:31.865 --> 00:02:35.989
is 80 degrees celsius.

00:02:35.996 --> 00:02:37.996
Let's say we also know,
just from previous tests,

00:02:37.996 --> 00:02:41.107
that after two minutes, after two minutes,

00:02:41.107 --> 00:02:43.529
it gets to 60 degrees celsius.

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:48.669
We also know that T of
two is 60 degrees celsius.

00:02:50.953 --> 00:02:53.014
Given all of this
information right over here,

00:02:53.014 --> 00:02:54.770
using Newton's Law of Cooling,

00:02:54.077 --> 00:02:55.883
and using all of this information we know

00:02:56.576 --> 00:02:59.838
about how bowls of oatmeal
that start at this temperature

00:02:59.838 --> 00:03:01.421
have cooled in the past,

00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:03.918
we want to know how long it will take.

00:03:03.918 --> 00:03:05.616
How many minutes will have to pass

00:03:05.616 --> 00:03:07.929
when you put an 80 degree
bowl of oatmeal in the room?

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:09.216
How many minutes have to pass

00:03:09.216 --> 00:03:11.327
in order for it to get to 40 degrees

00:03:11.327 --> 00:03:13.551
using this model?

00:03:13.551 --> 00:03:15.247
Let me write that down.

00:03:15.247 --> 00:03:16.688
So how long...

00:03:16.688 --> 00:03:21.074
How many minutes for...

00:03:23.978 --> 00:03:28.978
or let me just say to cool
to 40 degrees celsius?

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.132
I encourage you to pause the video now

00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:38.750
and try to figure it out.

00:03:39.191 --> 00:03:41.228
I'm assuming you have paused the video,

00:03:41.228 --> 00:03:43.339
and you have had your go at it

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:45.300
and the key is to use
all of this information

00:03:45.003 --> 00:03:48.001
right over here to solve
for the constants C and K,

00:03:48.298 --> 00:03:50.196
and once you know that, you essentially

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:52.659
have described your model.

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:56.467
Then you can apply it
to solve for the time

00:03:56.467 --> 00:03:59.468
that gets you to a temperature
of 40 degrees celsius.

00:03:59.567 --> 00:04:00.615
So let's do that.

00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:00.714
The first thing we know is

00:04:01.605 --> 00:04:03.732
the ambient temperature
is 20 degrees celsius.

00:04:03.732 --> 00:04:05.977
This right over here

00:04:06.502 --> 00:04:09.903
is 20 degrees.

00:04:09.903 --> 00:04:13.011
The most obvious thing
to solve for or to apply

00:04:13.011 --> 00:04:14.883
is what happens with T of zero.

00:04:14.883 --> 00:04:16.451
What's neat about T of zero,

00:04:16.451 --> 00:04:18.923
when T equals zero, this exponent is zero,

00:04:18.923 --> 00:04:20.959
either the zero power is one,

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.023
and so T of zero is
essentially going to simplify

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:25.224
to Ce plus 20 degrees.

00:04:25.224 --> 00:04:26.729
Let me actually right that down.

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.729
T of zero, which we
already know is 80 degrees,

00:04:32.181 --> 00:04:33.765
we already know as 80 degrees celsius.

00:04:33.765 --> 00:04:35.236
I'm just going to write 80.

00:04:35.236 --> 00:04:38.287
We will assume it's in degrees celsius.

00:04:38.287 --> 00:04:40.351
That is going to be equal to...

00:04:40.927 --> 00:04:41.930
That is going to be equal to

00:04:41.957 --> 00:04:43.244
when T equals zero, this,

00:04:43.244 --> 00:04:46.003
the e to the zero is just going to be one.

00:04:46.003 --> 00:04:51.003
It's going to be equal
to C plus, C plus 20.

00:04:52.804 --> 00:04:55.571
If you want to solve for
C, you just subtract 20

00:04:55.571 --> 00:04:59.294
from both sides of this equation.

00:04:59.618 --> 00:05:01.943
We are left with...

00:05:01.943 --> 00:05:06.943
We are left with 80 minus
20 is 60, is equal to C.

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:10.146
60 is equal to C.

00:05:10.178 --> 00:05:11.307
We were able to figure out C.

00:05:11.307 --> 00:05:14.148
Let's figure out what we know right now.

00:05:14.148 --> 00:05:18.161
We know that T, let me
do that in magenta color.

00:05:18.278 --> 00:05:21.399
We know that T of t, that's confusing,

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:25.014
upper case T of lower case t,

00:05:25.014 --> 00:05:26.615
temperature as a function of time,

00:05:26.615 --> 00:05:29.412
is going to be equal to...

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:31.994
is going to be equal
to in that same color,

00:05:31.994 --> 00:05:36.994
60 e to the negative
KT, negative KT plus 20,

00:05:42.877 --> 00:05:44.972
plus our ambient temperature.

00:05:44.972 --> 00:05:46.004
Plus our ambient temperature.

00:05:46.292 --> 00:05:48.445
Now, we need to solve for K.

00:05:48.445 --> 00:05:51.087
We can use this information
right over here to solve for K.

00:05:51.087 --> 00:05:55.339
T of two is equal to 60 degrees.

00:05:55.466 --> 00:05:56.539
If we make t as equal to two,

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:58.513
this thing is going to be 60 degrees.

00:05:58.513 --> 00:06:00.435
Let me write that down.

00:06:00.435 --> 00:06:03.089
Let me write that over
here so we have some space.

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:05.968
We have 60 is equal to...

00:06:05.968 --> 00:06:10.607
60 is equal to 60, is equal to 60

00:06:10.607 --> 00:06:14.136
e to the negative K T,

00:06:14.206 --> 00:06:15.915
all this color switching takes time,

00:06:15.915 --> 00:06:20.718
e to the negative K T, plus

00:06:20.718 --> 00:06:22.685
oh, and be careful, that's a times two.

00:06:22.685 --> 00:06:25.626
E to the negative K times two.

00:06:25.626 --> 00:06:27.370
That's a time equals two,

00:06:27.037 --> 00:06:29.730
I could write that E
to the negative two K.

00:06:30.063 --> 00:06:32.285
E to the negative two K,

00:06:32.285 --> 00:06:35.209
and then of course we have our plus 20.

00:06:35.429 --> 00:06:37.805
Then we have our plus 20.

00:06:37.805 --> 00:06:39.543
Now we just have to solve for K.

00:06:39.543 --> 00:06:42.534
Once again, at any point, if
you feel inspired to do so

00:06:42.534 --> 00:06:46.570
I encourage you to try
to solve it on your own.

00:06:46.057 --> 00:06:47.028
Alright, so let's do this.

00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:50.790
If we subtract 20 from both sides,

00:06:50.079 --> 00:06:55.079
we get 40 is equal to 60
e to the negative two K.

00:07:03.078 --> 00:07:06.132
Divide both sides by 60.

00:07:06.212 --> 00:07:11.212
You are left with two thirds.

00:07:11.281 --> 00:07:12.904
40 divided by 60 is two thirds.

00:07:12.904 --> 00:07:17.008
is equal to e to the negative two K.

00:07:17.493 --> 00:07:21.427
E to the negative two K.

00:07:21.427 --> 00:07:22.465
All this color changing takes work.

00:07:22.465 --> 00:07:23.860
Let me know if y'all
want me to keep changing.

00:07:23.086 --> 00:07:24.333
I enjoy changing colors.

00:07:25.107 --> 00:07:26.998
It just keeps it
interesting on the screen.

00:07:26.998 --> 00:07:29.400
Anyway, e to the negative two K.

00:07:29.004 --> 00:07:30.248
Actually, let me scroll down a little bit

00:07:30.644 --> 00:07:33.325
so I have some more real
estate to work with.

00:07:33.325 --> 00:07:35.260
Now I can take, let's see.

00:07:35.026 --> 00:07:37.248
I can take the natural log of both sides.

00:07:37.482 --> 00:07:41.130
So, I'll have the natural log.

00:07:41.213 --> 00:07:45.090
Natural log of two thirds is equal to

00:07:45.009 --> 00:07:48.187
the natural log of e
to the negative two K.

00:07:48.268 --> 00:07:48.847
That's the whole reason why

00:07:48.847 --> 00:07:50.678
I took the natural log of both sides.

00:07:50.678 --> 00:07:54.052
Then to solve for K, I divide
both sides by negative two.

00:07:54.052 --> 00:07:58.793
I get K is equal to negative one half.

00:07:58.793 --> 00:08:03.355
Negative one half the
natural log of two thirds.

00:08:03.355 --> 00:08:04.918
I just swapped sides.

00:08:04.918 --> 00:08:06.625
Natural log of two thirds.

00:08:06.625 --> 00:08:08.694
Let me do that since I kept
the colors going so long,

00:08:08.694 --> 00:08:10.515
let me keep it that way.

00:08:10.515 --> 00:08:12.554
Natural log of two thirds.

00:08:12.554 --> 00:08:16.539
So we have solved for
all of the constants.

00:08:16.539 --> 00:08:19.206
Now we can rewrite this
thing right over here.

00:08:19.206 --> 00:08:20.995
We can rewrite it as...

00:08:20.995 --> 00:08:22.596
We just need a mini drumroll here,

00:08:22.596 --> 00:08:24.360
we are not completely done yet.

00:08:24.036 --> 00:08:29.036
We get t of T is equal to 60 e...

00:08:33.405 --> 00:08:35.945
e to the negative K.

00:08:35.945 --> 00:08:37.004
Well, negative K, the
negative and negative

00:08:37.534 --> 00:08:38.481
is going to be positive.

00:08:38.481 --> 00:08:41.148
It will be one half
natural log of two thirds.

00:08:41.148 --> 00:08:45.023
So one half natural log of two thirds.

00:08:45.023 --> 00:08:47.080
Negative K, so negative of a negative.

00:08:47.008 --> 00:08:49.926
One half natural log of two thirds,

00:08:49.998 --> 00:08:51.541
which actually will be a negative value.

00:08:51.541 --> 00:08:53.545
Two thirds is less than e,
so you are going to have

00:08:53.941 --> 00:08:55.900
a natural log of it is
going to be negative

00:08:55.009 --> 00:08:56.826
so it makes you feel
good that the temperature

00:08:57.717 --> 00:09:00.263
is going to be going down over time.

00:09:00.263 --> 00:09:05.263
So, plus or times T, plus 20.

00:09:07.701 --> 00:09:10.836
Now, all we have to do is
figure out what T get us

00:09:10.836 --> 00:09:13.381
to a temperature of 40 degrees celsius.

00:09:13.381 --> 00:09:14.780
Let's solve for that.

00:09:14.078 --> 00:09:17.815
If we want this to be
40, 40 is equal to...

00:09:18.517 --> 00:09:20.555
Actually now I'm just
going to stick to one color

00:09:20.555 --> 00:09:23.208
as we march through this part.

00:09:23.208 --> 00:09:28.208
40 is going to be equal to 60
e to the one half natural log

00:09:29.813 --> 00:09:34.355
of two thirds T power plus 20.

00:09:34.355 --> 00:09:35.451
Now, let's see.

00:09:35.451 --> 00:09:37.556
We can subtract 20 from both sides.

00:09:37.556 --> 00:09:42.540
We get to 20 is equal to 60
e to all that crazy business,

00:09:42.054 --> 00:09:46.473
one half natural log
of two thirds times T.

00:09:46.959 --> 00:09:50.647
Now we can divide both sides
by 60 and we get one third.

00:09:50.647 --> 00:09:52.359
20 divided by 60 is one third,

00:09:52.359 --> 00:09:57.359
is equal to e to the one half natural log

00:09:58.077 --> 00:10:02.140
of two thirds times T.

00:10:02.014 --> 00:10:05.218
Now, let's see, we can take
the natural log of both sides.

00:10:05.344 --> 00:10:10.344
The natural log of one third is equal to

00:10:11.951 --> 00:10:16.951
one half natural log of two thirds times T

00:10:17.863 --> 00:10:19.252
and then home stretch to solve for T

00:10:19.252 --> 00:10:20.786
you just divide both sides by one half

00:10:20.786 --> 00:10:22.489
natural log of two thirds.

00:10:22.489 --> 00:10:25.447
We get T is equal to this, which is

00:10:25.447 --> 00:10:30.447
the natural log of one third divided by

00:10:30.054 --> 00:10:31.706
one half natural log of two thirds.

00:10:32.192 --> 00:10:33.698
Well, if you divide by one
half that's the same thing

00:10:33.698 --> 00:10:35.344
as multiplying by two.

00:10:35.344 --> 00:10:40.344
Then you are going to divide
by natural log of two thirds.

00:10:42.091 --> 00:10:46.067
Let's see if this actually
makes a sensical answer.

00:10:46.067 --> 00:10:47.600
Let me get a calculator out.

00:10:47.006 --> 00:10:52.006
Actually, I could just use Google here.

00:10:52.885 --> 00:10:56.573
I had ... I already forgot what it was.

00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:58.260
Natural log one--

00:10:58.026 --> 00:10:59.142
So I had natural log one third

00:10:59.376 --> 00:11:00.390
over natural log of two thirds

00:11:00.039 --> 00:11:01.403
and the whole thing times two.

00:11:01.754 --> 00:11:06.754
So I can type two times the
natural log of one third

00:11:17.904 --> 00:11:22.904
divided by the natural log of two thirds.

00:11:24.473 --> 00:11:28.086
Let's see what Google gets us.

00:11:28.663 --> 00:11:30.801
Alright, it didn't ...

00:11:30.801 --> 00:11:32.606
How did I mess up?

00:11:32.606 --> 00:11:33.684
This is equal to two
times the natural log--

00:11:34.386 --> 00:11:36.789
Oh, okay, it messed up the parenthesis.

00:11:36.789 --> 00:11:37.798
Let me make this clear.

00:11:37.879 --> 00:11:41.697
The natural log of one third

00:11:41.697 --> 00:11:45.385
divided by the natural log of two thirds.

00:11:47.308 --> 00:11:48.740
Then, there you go.

00:11:48.074 --> 00:11:49.733
If we were to round to
the nearest hundredth

00:11:50.399 --> 00:11:53.263
it would be five point four two.

00:11:53.263 --> 00:11:56.438
Five point four two minutes.

00:11:56.438 --> 00:11:58.537
Remember, everything we
were doing were in minutes.

00:11:58.537 --> 00:12:02.760
This right over here, this
is approximately equal to

00:12:02.076 --> 00:12:06.107
five point four two.

00:12:07.007 --> 00:12:09.964
Five point four two minutes.

00:12:10.027 --> 00:12:11.220
And we are done!

00:12:11.022 --> 00:12:16.022
That's how long it will take
us to cool to 40 degrees.
