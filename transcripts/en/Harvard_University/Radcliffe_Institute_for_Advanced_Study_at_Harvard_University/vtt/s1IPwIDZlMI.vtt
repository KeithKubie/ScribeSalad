[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.040
- So today, we've changed
it up a little bit

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.010
and met here at
Schlesinger Library.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.149
We discussed a packet of poetry
a prolific female authors

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.550
who are based in
Cambridge and in Harvard.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.130
And we were able to see a
lot of original documents

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.390
from Adrienne Rich's
life at the library.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.200
- One of the ways we understand
the work of any great writer,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.400
if we are so lucky as to have
access to that writer's papers,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:40.630
is to watch the writer develop
through the kinds of materials

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.120
that are not available
to the public.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.730
- So we got to kind of
go through the timeline

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.200
of her life, looking
at the things

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.300
that she left behind
and left to Harvard.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.320
I got to see things that she
drew as, like, a six-year-old.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.970
- She had one very
impressive poem on cavemen

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.400
where she had a very
opinionated view

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.000
on how modern men are lesser
than cavemen from that time,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.320
which I found hilarious.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.030
- And then kind of move as she
became this college student

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.760
at Radcliffe, as
she started to delve

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.410
into, like, feminist writing.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:18.160
- For instance, to have the
correspondence in one's hands

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.480
that Adrienne Rich exchanged
with all the major poets

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.890
of her moment is to
understand something

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.480
you can't get from just
reading an individual poem.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.180
- This side of poetry
that you don't always see,

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.670
getting to see how these people
were real, they interacted.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.280
- It's to understand the
conditions of publication

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.340
that bore on the poet, a
sense of poetic community.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.110
- So in a normal
seminar room, I think

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.720
it's more like we
read the poems,

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.120
we say, oh, this poem
has a definite structure.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.110
This lends to
emphasize this point.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.730
But you can't really see
how a person changes just

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:01.870
by reading their work.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.720
You can really gain
more if you look

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.610
at their personal
artifacts and get

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.820
to see, like, their journals
from when they were a kid.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.920
- It made me feel a
lot closer to the works

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.045
that we were talking about.

00:02:13.045 --> 00:02:15.545
It feels like you're kind of
right in the epicenter of where

00:02:15.545 --> 00:02:17.280
it was created and
where it came from.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.930
You kind of came back to
the home of Adrienne Rich.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.330
- It was just amazing, from
an academic standpoint,

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.420
to be able to see the person
that we're reading about

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.990
and see their physical
evidence of their life here.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.740
- There's always going
to be something new

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.647
here for me to find, and
for me to learn about.

00:02:32.647 --> 00:02:34.480
- The resources here
are absolutely amazing.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.080
Being able to just simply ask to
have a look at some of Adrienne

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.160
Rich's or various other famous
poets' and authors' works

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.350
whenever you want is a resource
that I don't think many people

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.250
are afforded.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.810
- I brought them
to the Schlesinger

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.770
because I wanted to
expose them to an archive

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.470
where one can touch
materials, some of which

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.920
have never really been
interpreted before.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.450
And so the exciting
originary work of a scholar

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.810
is something that one can
begin to give students

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.820
a sense of by bringing
them to an archive.
