00:00:01.068 --> 00:00:03.270
President Trump will not be
attending this year's

00:00:03.303 --> 00:00:04.805
White House
Correspondents Dinner because

00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:08.775
-he's taking his ball
and going home. -(laughter)

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:09.910
He tweeting this weekend,

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:12.246
"Please wish everyone well
and have a great evening!"

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:16.049
Which is literally the nicest
thing he's ever tweeted.

00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:18.085
-(laughter and groaning)
-Or thought or said.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:20.053
The playful annual banquet
of politicians, journalists

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:22.623
and entertainers has been around
since before the days of

00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:23.757
President Warren G. Harding

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.793
and Vice President
Nate Dogg Calhoun.

00:00:26.827 --> 00:00:30.130
(laughter, applause &amp; cheering)

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:38.305
Here they are in a file photo
about to regulate Wall Street.

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:40.107
(laughter)

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.243
Trump's decision is unusual,

00:00:43.277 --> 00:00:44.845
but other presidents have
skipped the event in the past.

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:45.979
JFK in 1962

00:00:46.013 --> 00:00:49.283
to protest the exclusion
of women from the press corps,

00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:51.418
Reagan in 1981 following
an assassination attempt,

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:52.819
and Bush in 2003 'cause

00:00:52.853 --> 00:00:54.821
he locked himself
in the Lincoln bathroom,

00:00:54.855 --> 00:00:56.523
-and, uh...
-(laughter)

00:00:56.557 --> 00:00:58.559
He's trying to get that door.

00:00:58.592 --> 00:01:01.128
I love that tiling.

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:02.596
Comedians, Trump's made a habit

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.231
of disregarding
presidential traditions.

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:06.166
What's he going to flout next?
Slink.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.703
I think this time
Trump is gonna defy tradition

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:11.672
by not lasting
the whole four years in office.

00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:13.340
HARDWICK:
All right, yeah, points.

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:15.275
-It's very possible.
-(cheers and applause)

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:18.378
It's very possible.

00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:20.113
Doug.

00:01:20.147 --> 00:01:22.482
He's not gonna pardon
two turkeys.

00:01:22.516 --> 00:01:24.384
-He's gonna eat
two turkeys alive. -(laughter)

00:01:24.418 --> 00:01:25.552
-HARDWICK: All right.
-SLINK JOHNSON: Ah!

00:01:25.586 --> 00:01:27.821
Points. Jessimae.

00:01:27.855 --> 00:01:29.823
I think he's gonna change
the lyrics

00:01:29.857 --> 00:01:33.861
of "America the Beautiful" to
"America, the seven out of ten.

00:01:33.894 --> 00:01:37.764
-Put some..."
-(laughter, applause &amp; cheering)

00:01:37.798 --> 00:01:40.701
There's more.

00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:43.337
HARDWICK: Ah. "America,
the seven out of ten.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.472
-I'd still stick it in, but,
you know." -PELUSO: Yeah.

00:01:45.506 --> 00:01:48.575
-(laughter) -Put some fake tits
on her, make it nine out of ten.

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:49.877
-HARDWICK: Yeah, all right.
-I don't know why

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.279
-he's Italian
all of a sudden. -Hey.

00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:53.547
-Hey! -Hey. -HARDWICK: Hey,
I'm-a President-a Trump

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.382
-over here.
-I know. I know.

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:57.751
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-BENSON: I like the tits yuge.

00:01:57.784 --> 00:01:59.186
-Hey! -HARDWICK: Hey!
-Hey!

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.189
-Oh. -HARDWICK: Come on!
-(laughter)

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:05.392
-(applause and cheering)
-Oh!

00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:06.894
HARDWICK:
By the way,

00:02:06.927 --> 00:02:08.428
our good friend
Anthony Atamanuik,

00:02:08.462 --> 00:02:09.830
whose performed his incredible
Trump impression

00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:10.797
on our show
on countless occasions,

00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:14.868
has volunteered
to attend in POTUS's stead.

00:02:14.902 --> 00:02:17.404
A lot of people
support the idea,

00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:21.308
including Mark freaking Hamill,
so let's make this happen.

00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:25.279
Tweet at @whca, use the hashtag
#MakeAnthonyTrumpAgain.

00:02:25.312 --> 00:02:27.347
Let's see if we can get him
at the White House

00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:27.447
-Correspondents Dinner.
-(cheers and applause)
