00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:09.600
We're on problem 49.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.010
And it says, what is the square
root of 7 plus the

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.210
square root of 7, and
all of that squared.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.230
So this is really just a little
bit of simplification.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.275
So if I have two of something,
in this case, I have 2 square

00:00:23.275 --> 00:00:26.880
roots of 7, if I add them
together, I get 2 of it, so I

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.300
get 2 square roots of 7,
and I'm squaring that.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.960
And 2 square roots of 7 squared,
that's equal to 2

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.070
squared times the square root
of 7 squared, right?

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.270
That's just your exponent
properties, so that is equal

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.490
to 4 times-- what's the square
root of 7 squared?

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.100
Well, it's just 7, right?

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.310
So it's 4 times 7, which
is equal to 28,

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.120
which is choice C.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.160
Next problem.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.350
50.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.220
In a certain population, there
are three times as many people

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.140
aged 21 or under as there
are people over 21.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:11.770
OK, so let's say that x is equal
to under 21 and y is

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.300
equal to over 21.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.820
So in a certain population,
there are three times as many

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:26.620
people aged 21 or under as
there are people over 21.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.960
So this is the number of people
under 21 and there are

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.050
three times as many as
there are over 21.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:40.750
The ratio of those 21 or under
to the total population is?

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.360
So they want to know the ratio
of x, 21 or under, to the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.765
total population, not just to
the over 21 population.

00:01:50.765 --> 00:01:52.890
So what's the total
population?

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.240
That's everyone, right? x plus
y is equal to total.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.675
So what they want is the
ratio of x to x plus y.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.460
And then we could do a little
bit of substitution.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.420
We know x is equal
to 3y, so let's

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.450
substitute that into this.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.370
Remember, this is the ratio
they're trying to figure out:

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.030
the ratio of 21 or under to
the total population.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.470
So x is equal to 3y
over 3y plus y.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.280
And I just did that because,
wow, if we do that then it

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.470
looks like we could be able
to cancel out all the y's.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.950
So we get 3y over what?

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.700
What's 3y plus another y?

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.210
Well, it's 4y.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.460
The y's cancel out.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.950
You get 3/4.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.020
And that is choice E, 3:4.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.530
Next question.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.930
51.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.370
And actually, you know, you
didn't even have to do it

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.040
algebraically.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.710
If you just think about question
50, you could have

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:54.540
just played with numbers.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.490
You can say, OK, there are three
times as many people

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.110
aged 21 or under as there
are people over 21.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.330
So you just say, OK, if there's
one person over 21,

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.300
there'd be three people under
21, and there'd be a total of

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.900
four people, so it
would be 3:4.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.640
But anyway, either way it
didn't take us too long.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.510
So they've drawn
a figure here.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.520
Let me draw it as well.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.450
So they have two lines that
intersect something like that.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.700
And they say that this angle
right here is 3x degrees.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.510
This angle is y plus 30 degrees,
and they say this

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.130
angle is 2x degrees.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.030
And they say, in the figure
above, the value of y is what?

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.090
Well, there's a bunch of
ways you can do it.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.220
The way this pops out to me is
we could figure out x because

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.850
we know that this angle plus
this angle is equal to 180

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.530
degrees, because they
are supplementary.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.060
They go all the way halfway
around a circle.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:57.010
So we know that if we add 3x
plus 2x, that should equal 180

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.330
degrees, or 5x is
equal to 180.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.330
Or that x is equal to what?

00:04:05.836 --> 00:04:09.870
Let's see, 30 times 5 is 150,
then you have 30 left over, so

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.120
it's 36 degrees, right?

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.090
36 times 5 is, yep, 180.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.610
And now we know if x is 36
degrees, what is this angle?

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.200
Well, this angle is going
to be 72 degrees.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.920
It's 2 times x.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.920
72 degrees.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.030
And then this angle and this
angle are opposite angles.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.570
And you could do the angle game
module on Khan Academy,

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.810
if that doesn't ring a bell,
but that should ring a bell

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:34.440
from geometry.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.270
And there's another way
you could do it.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.020
You could say that this angle
plus this angle have to equal

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.990
180, either way.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.590
You could do it either way.

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.180
But the easiest way is to say
that this angle and this angle

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.680
are equal, because they're
opposite angles.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.210
So we know that y plus
30 has to equal this

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.190
angle, equals 72.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.330
Subtract 30 from both sides,
you get y is equal to 42

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.170
degrees, which is choice E.

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.480
Next problem.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.600
Let me make it a different
color now.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.440
52.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.560
Kelly and Chris packed several
boxes with books.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:28.220
If Chris packed 60% of the total
number of boxes, what

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.420
was the ratio of the number of
boxes Kelly packed to the

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.130
number of boxes Chris packed?

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.865
So they want to know the ratio
of Kelly to Chris, right?

00:05:38.865 --> 00:05:42.640
Well, if Chris packed 60% of the
total, we could say, let C

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.030
be the number that Chris packed,
so that'll be equal to

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.660
0.6 of the total.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.480
Well, then that means that
Kelly packed the

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.330
rest of them, right?

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.090
So, I'm assuming it's a she,
Kelly would have packed the

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.630
remainder, which is
40% of the total.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.800
So the ratio of the number
that Chris-- what do

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.730
they want to know?

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.190
What was the ratio of the number
of boxes Kelly packed

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.170
to the number of boxes
Chris packed.

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.990
So the want to know the
ratio of K to C.

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:15.770
Well, K is 0.4T and C is 0.6T.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.170
T's cancel out.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:20.350
You get, essentially, 4/6,
which is 2/3, right?

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.150
If you multiply the top and the
bottom by 10, it becomes

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:29.450
4/6, so you get 2:3, and
that is choice E.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:37.270
Problem 53.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:44.070
Of the following, which is the
closest approximation of 50.2

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:49.100
times 0.49 over 199.8?

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.220
So I haven't looked at the
choices yet, but if I had to

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.120
approximate what this is, I
would say, well, that's close

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.210
to 50, right?

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:01.700
50.2 is really close to 50
times-- 0.49 is really close

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.920
to 0.5, all of that over--
199.8 is really

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.870
close to 200, right?

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.215
So you could view this
as being equal to

00:07:12.215 --> 00:07:17.620
-- let's see, 25/200.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:22.540
And 25/200, you could divide the
top and the bottom by 25.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:26.030
You get 1 over-- 25 goes into
100 four times, goes into

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:27.850
200-- eight times.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.190
And that is one of our choices,
so I'll go with that.

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:31.730
B.

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:34.150
1/8.

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:40.980
Problem 54.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:49.800
The average of 10, 30, and 50.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:54.550
So the average is going to
be 10 plus 30 plus 50.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:59.280
So the average of those three
is that, divided by 3.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.300
First of all, what is that?

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.730
Well, it looks like it
should be 30, right?

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:06.020
Because you get 60 plus
30/3, so that's 90.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:14.630
So the average of 10, 30, and 50
is 5 more than the average

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:25.570
of 20, 40, and one of
the choices, and x.

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:28.060
So to write this, we say, OK,
we figured out that the

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:32.950
average-- oh, sorry, the average
here isn't-- sorry,

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:34.520
let me redo this for you.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.210
So they say the average of 10,
30, and 50, and we already

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:39.960
figured out 10 plus
30 plus 50.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:45.120
If you average that, divided by
3, you get 90 divided by 3

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:45.950
is equal to 30.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:47.740
And you actually didn't even
have to do the math.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.620
You could have said, oh, we'll
have 30 in the middle.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.990
50 is 20 more than 30.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.360
10 is 20 less than 30.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.220
So the average is
going to be 30.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:55.850
But this didn't take
you much time.

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:57.520
So the average is 30.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:02.030
And they say that that is 5 more
than the average of 20,

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:03.900
40, and another number.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:08.080
So 30 is equal to 5
plus the average

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.590
of those three numbers.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:15.260
So the average of those three
numbers is 20 plus 40 plus x,

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.130
over 3, right?

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:19.805
So let's just simplify this.

00:09:19.805 --> 00:09:21.600
Let's subtract 5 from
both sides.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:28.745
You get 25 is equal to 20
plus 40 plus x, over 3.

00:09:28.745 --> 00:09:31.760
So you multiply both
sides by 3.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:39.190
You get 75 is equal
to 60 plus x.

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:41.250
And then you subtract
60 from both sides.

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:46.060
You get x is equal to 15,
and that is choice A.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.815
And I'm almost out of
time, so I'll see

00:09:47.815 --> 00:09:48.690
you in the next video.

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:50.100
See you soon.
