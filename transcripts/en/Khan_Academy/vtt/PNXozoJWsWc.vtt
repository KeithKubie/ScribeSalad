00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.150
In this video, I want to tackle
some inequalities that

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.290
involve multiplying and dividing
by positive and

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.070
negative numbers, and you'll
see that it's a little bit

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.530
more tricky than just the adding
and subtracting numbers

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:12.540
that we saw in the last video.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.960
I also want to introduce you
to some other types of

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.905
notations for describing the
solution set of an inequality.

00:00:18.905 --> 00:00:21.390
So let's do a couple
of examples.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.510
So let's say I had negative
0.5x is less

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.115
than or equal to 7.5.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.810
Now, if this was an equality,
your natural impulse is to

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.430
say, hey, let's divide both
sides by the coefficient on

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.670
the x term, and that is a
completely legitimate thing to

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.680
do: divide both sides
by negative 0.5.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.850
The important thing you need to
realize, though, when you

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.160
do it with an inequality is
that when you multiply or

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.920
divide both sides of the
equation by a negative number,

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.776
you swap the inequality.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.360
Think of it this way.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.210
I'll do a simple example here.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.900
If I were to tell you that 1
is less than 2, I think you

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.600
would agree with that.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.970
1 is definitely less than 2.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.470
Now, what happens if I multiply
both sides of this by

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.700
negative 1?

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.930
Negative 1 versus negative 2?

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.700
Well, all of a sudden, negative
2 is more negative

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.730
than negative 1.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.510
So here, negative 2 is actually
less than negative 1.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.800
Now, this isn't a proof, but I
think it'll give you comfort

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.680
on why you're swapping
the sign.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.120
If something is larger, when you
take the negative of both

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.820
of it, it'll be more negative,
or vice versa.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.100
So that's why, if we're going to
multiply both sides of this

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.080
equation or divide both sides of
the equation by a negative

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.940
number, we need to
swap the sign.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.610
So let's multiply both sides
of this equation.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.950
Dividing by 0.5 is the same
thing as multiplying by 2.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.650
Our whole goal here is to have
a 1 coefficient there.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.400
So let's multiply both
sides of this

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.830
equation by negative 2.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.320
So we have negative 2
times negative 0.5.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.770
And you might say, hey, how
did Sal get this 2 here?

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.310
My brain is just thinking what
can I multiply negative

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.380
0.5 by to get 1?

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.230
And negative 0.5 is the same
thing as negative 1/2.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.510
The inverse of that
is negative 2.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.270
So I'm multiplying negative
2 times both

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.430
sides of this equation.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.660
And I have the 7.5 on
the other side.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.110
I'm going to multiply that
by negative 2 as well.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.520
And remember, when you multiply
or divide both sides

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.330
of an inequality by a negative,
you swap the

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.690
inequality.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.820
You had less than or equal?

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.790
Now it'll be greater
than or equal.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.960
So the left-hand side,
negative 2 times

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.070
negative 0.5 is just 1.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.450
You get x is greater than or
equal to 7.5 times negative 2.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.670
That's negative 15, which
is our solution set.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.190
All x's larger than negative 15
will satisfy this equation.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.200
I challenge you to try it.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.610
For example, 0 will work.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.460
0 is greater than negative 15.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.710
But try something like--
try negative 16.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.070
Negative 16 will not work.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.820
Negative 16 times negative
0.5 is 8, which is

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.790
not less than 7.5.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.470
So the solution set is all of
the x's-- let me draw a number

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.840
line here-- greater
than negative 15.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.610
So that is negative 15 there,
maybe that's negative 16,

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.040
that's negative 14.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:41.570
Greater than or equal to
negative 15 is the solution.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.830
Now, you might also see solution
sets to inequalities

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.610
written in interval notation.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.640
And interval notation, it
just takes a little

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.010
getting used to.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.280
We want to include negative 15,
so our lower bound to our

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.780
interval is negative 15.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.190
And putting in this bracket here
means that we're going to

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.530
include negative 15.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.880
The set includes the
bottom boundary.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.780
It includes negative 15.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.963
And we're going to go all
the way to infinity.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.110
And we put a parentheses here.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.290
Parentheses normally means that
you're not including the

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.100
upper bound.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.779
You also do it for infinity,
because infinity really isn't

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:20.850
a normal number, so to speak.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.940
You can't just say, oh,
I'm at infinity.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.540
You're never at infinity.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.040
So that's why you put
that parentheses.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.070
But the parentheses tends to
mean that you don't include

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.040
that boundary, but you also
use it with infinity.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.680
So this and this are the
exact same thing.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.940
Sometimes you might also see
set notations, where the

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:48.630
solution of that, they might
say x is a real number such

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.650
that-- that little line, that
vertical line thing, just

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:58.070
means such that-- x is greater
than or equal to negative 15.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.260
These curly brackets mean the
set of all real numbers, or

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.320
the set of all numbers, where x
is a real number, such that

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.430
x is greater than or equal
to negative 15.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.390
All of this, this, and this
are all equivalent.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.610
Let's keep that in mind and do
a couple of more examples.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:25.400
So let's say we had 75x is
greater than or equal to 125.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:31.030
So here we can just divide
both sides by 75.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.020
And since 75 is a positive
number, you don't have to

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.620
change the inequality.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:41.070
So you get x is greater than
or equal to 125/75.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.240
And if you divide the numerator
and denominator by

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.440
25, this is 5/3.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.950
So x is greater than
or equal to 5/3.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:56.220
Or we could write the solution
set being from including 5/3

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.380
to infinity.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.230
And once again, if you were
to graph it on a number

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.630
line, 5/3 is what?

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.650
That's 1 and 2/3.

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:12.940
So you have 0, 1, 2, and
1 and 2/3 will be

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:13.660
right around there.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.200
We're going to include it.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.320
That right there is 5/3.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.960
And everything greater than or
equal to that will be included

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.970
in our solution set.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:24.850
Let's do another one.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:33.170
Let's say we have x over
negative 3 is greater than

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.900
negative 10/9.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.720
So we want to just isolate the
x on the left-hand side.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:45.990
So let's multiply both sides
by negative 3, right?

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.770
The coefficient, you could
imagine, is negative 1/3, so

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:51.360
we want to multiply by the
inverse, which should be

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.700
negative 3.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.590
So if you multiply both sides
by negative 3, you get

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.940
negative 3 times-- this you
could rewrite it as negative

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:06.000
1/3x, and on this side, you
have negative 10/9 times

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.220
negative 3.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.350
And the inequality will
switch, because we are

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:13.330
multiplying or dividing
by a negative number.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:14.980
So the inequality will switch.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.940
It'll go from greater
than to less than.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.630
So the left-hand side of the
equation just becomes an x.

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:23.540
That was the whole point.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:24.810
That cancels out with that.

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:27.870
The negatives cancel out.
x is less than.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.480
And then you have a negative
times a negative.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.260
That will make it a positive.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.010
Then if you divide the numerator
and the denominator

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:41.430
by 3, you get a 1 and a 3,
so x is less than 10/3.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.630
So if we were to write this
in interval notation, the

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:48.900
solution set will-- the upper
bound will be 10/3 and it

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.290
won't include 10/3.

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:52.270
This isn't less than or equal
to, so we're going to put a

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:53.870
parentheses here.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:55.390
Notice, here it included 5/3.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:56.180
We put a bracket.

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:57.760
Here, we're not including
10/3.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.240
We put a parentheses.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:04.560
It'll go from 10/3, all the way
down to negative infinity.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.850
Everything less than 10/3
is in our solution set.

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:09.640
And let's draw that.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.170
Let's draw the solution set.

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:17.560
So 10/3, so we might
have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.340
10/3 is 3 and 1/3, so it might
sit-- let me do it in a

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.840
different color.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:23.440
It might be over here.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.410
We're not going to
include that.

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:25.690
It's less than 10/3.

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:28.120
10/3 is not in the
solution set.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:32.150
That is 10/3 right there, and
everything less than that, but

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:39.169
not including 10/3, is
in our solution set.

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:41.720
Let's do one more.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:54.430
Say we have x over negative
15 is less than 8.

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.820
So once again, let's multiply
both sides of this equation by

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:58.520
negative 15.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:03.700
So negative 15 times
x over negative 15.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.880
Then you have an 8 times
a negative 15.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.640
And when you multiply both sides
of an inequality by a

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.300
negative number or divide both
sides by a negative number,

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:13.730
you swap the inequality.

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:17.960
It's less than, you change
it to greater than.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.260
And now, this left-hand side
just becomes an x, because

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.955
these guys cancel out.

00:09:22.955 --> 00:09:28.860
x is greater than 8 times 15
is 80 plus 40 is 120, so

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.010
negative 120.

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:31.640
Is that right?

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.270
80 plus 40.

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:34.810
Yep, negative 120.

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:38.330
Or we could write the solution
set as starting at negative

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:41.090
120-- but we're not including
negative 120.

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:43.450
We don't have an equal
sign here-- going all

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:46.690
the way up to infinity.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:49.280
And if we were to graph
it, let me draw

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.290
the number line here.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:52.280
I'll do a real quick one.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.720
Let's say that that
is negative 120.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.170
Maybe zero is sitting up here.

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:58.240
This would be negative 121.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.110
This would be negative 119.

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:04.670
We are not going to include
negative 120, because we don't

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.470
have an equal sign there, but
it's going to be everything

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:09.280
greater than negative 120.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.970
All of these things that I'm
shading in green would satisfy

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:12.660
the inequality.

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:13.510
And you can even try it out.

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:14.860
Does zero work?

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:15.980
0/15?

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:16.820
Yeah, that's zero.

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.250
That's definitely less than 8.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:20.020
I mean, that doesn't prove it to
you, but you could try any

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:22.750
of these numbers and
they should work.

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:24.470
Anyway, hopefully, you
found that helpful.

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.820
I'll see you in the
next video.
