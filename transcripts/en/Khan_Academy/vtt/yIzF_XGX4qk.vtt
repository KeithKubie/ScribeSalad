00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.860
We're on problem 14.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.109
And it asks us what is the
solution to the inequality x

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.710
minus 5 is greater than 14?

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.530
Well, to do this, this
is just like solving

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.820
any equality or equation.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.000
What we do to one side, we have
to do the other side.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.060
And we want to get rid of this
minus 5, and the best way to

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.206
get rid of a minus 5 is to add
5, so lets add 5 to both sides

00:00:25.206 --> 00:00:26.610
of this equation.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.910
So 5 plus and then a plus 5.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.340
And then a 5 plus a
minus 5, that's 0.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.530
That's why we added the
5 in the first place.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.240
So we're just left with
an x on that side.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.610
We get x is greater than
14 plus 5, which is 19.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.650
That's choice B.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.980
Problem 15.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.195
The lengths of the sides
of a triangle are--

00:00:47.195 --> 00:00:49.300
so we have a triangle.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.090
They tell us the lengths of the
sides are y, y plus 1, and

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.180
7 centimeters.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.530
They also tell us the perimeter
is 56 centimeters.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.660
The perimeter is equal
to 56 centimeters.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.670
What is the value of y?

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.590
So the perimeter of any shape is
just the sum of the sides.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.240
So y plus y plus 1 plus 7.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.820
That's the distance around
the triangle.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.200
And that is equal to
the perimeter,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.600
which is equal to 56.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:27.110
Let's see, we get y plus y is
2y, plus 1 plus 7 is 8, is

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.560
equal to 56, so you get 2y
is equal to what is that?

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.600
56.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.870
So if we subtract 8 from both
sides of this equation, on the

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.240
left-hand side, we
just get 2y.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.460
On the right-hand side,
56 minus 8, that's 48.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:49.360
Divide both sides by 2 and
you get y is equal to 24.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.100
And that is choice A.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.480
Problem 16.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.690
Now what do they
want us to do?

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.620
All right, I think this is one
I should copy and paste.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.700
OK, now they're telling us--
let me pick a good color.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.970
Which number serves as a
counterexample to the

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:16.410
statement below?

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.370
So, a counterexample, an example
that shows that this

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.440
isn't always true.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.430
So the statement is all
positive integers are

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.480
divisible by 2 or 3.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.770
So we just have to find a
positive integer that is not

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.950
divisible by 2 or 3,
by neither 2 nor 3.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.810
Well, 100 is divisible
by 2, right?

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.230
So that just verifies or it's
just another example of a

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.350
positive integer that's
divisible by one of these two,

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.790
so it's not choice A.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.640
It's not a counterexample.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.670
57, It's not divisible by 2,
but it is divisible by 3.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.550
19 times 3 is 57.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.440
So it's not choice B.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.870
57 is another positive integer
that's divisible by 2 or 3.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.670
It's divisible by 3,
so it's not that.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.390
30's divisible by both, so
that's definitely not a

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.010
counterexample.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.360
But here we have 25.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.205
It's a positive integer and it
is neither divisible by 2 nor

00:03:08.205 --> 00:03:10.600
3, so it disproves
the statement.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.160
So it is a counterexample.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.230
And so the answer is D.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.260
Problem 17.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.620
Let me copy and paste
this one.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.410
Copied it.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.210
Pasted it.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.460
All right.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.550
What is the conclusion of the
statement in the box below?

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.330
OK, they say if x squared
is equal to 4.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.470
So if we know that x squared is
equal to 4, then we know,

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.440
and we know this from algebra,
we could have solved it, that

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.710
x is equal to minus 2 or 2.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.020
All right, so what is the
conclusion of the statement in

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.420
the box below?

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.380
Oh, OK.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.360
I think I'm reading
this too much.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.840
This is the condition and
this is the conclusion.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.370
They're saying if this
has happened,

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.670
then we conclude that.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.910
So they're actually just
asking us to label it.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.450
This is the conclusion.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.060
Then x is equal to
minus 2 or 2.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.810
I don't like that question
so much.

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.480
My reaction was, OK, if this is
the whole statement, what

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.920
can I conclude from it?

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.210
And there's not a lot that I
could conclude from it unless

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.090
they told me that this
indeed was true.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.810
But anyway, I don't want
to get too complicated.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.110
They're just saying that if
this is true, then we can

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.010
conclude this.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.970
And they're actually just saying
what is the conclusion?

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.350
So what part of this statement
can we label as the

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.370
conclusion?

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.160
Well, that's the conclusion,
so that's choice D.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.410
I didn't like that.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.740
That was more meaning
of words than math.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.990
But anyway, problem 18.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.400
All right, let me copy and
paste this one, too.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.490
Which of the following
is a valid

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.800
conclusion to the statement?

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.730
OK.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.100
You see, now if a student is a
high school band member, then

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.280
the student is a
good musician.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.130
So if you're in the high school
band, high school band

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.450
member, then you're going
to be a good musician.

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:20.510
That's what this says.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.370
And if you compare this
to the last question,

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.020
that could be confusing.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.030
Because a valid conclusion--
so once again, here they're

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.690
giving us a statement and they
want us to come to some

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:30.490
conclusion.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:31.310
They might have said
what is the

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.410
conclusion of this statement?

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:34.580
And then you would have
said, oh, the

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.730
student is a good musician.

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.180
But that's not what
they're asking.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.370
They're saying, OK, if this
whole thing is a statement, if

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.260
we know that this whole thing
is true, if they're in the

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.630
high school band, then they're
a good musician, which I kind

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.110
of wrote in shorthand here.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.630
They're asking, OK, if we know
that to be true, which of

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.440
these statements can we
conclude from that?

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.870
Statement A says, all
good musicians are

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.510
high school band members.

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:59.810
Well, that doesn't
tell us that.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.460
It doesn't say that all good
musicians-- the good musicians

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.530
could be this circle and the
high school band members would

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.580
be a subset of it.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.680
High school band, and this
could be good musicians.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.090
So right, all high school band
members are good musicians,

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.410
but there could be people out
here who are good musicians

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:17.890
who aren't high school
band members.

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.170
So it's not choice A.

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.520
A student is a high school
band member.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.600
Well, no.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.060
High school band members, they
didn't tell us that all of the

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.380
students are high school band
members or the high school

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.870
band is comprised of all
of the students.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.010
The student body might
be like this circle.

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:37.680
Some of them might be in
the high school band.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.640
Some of them aren't and
are good musicians.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.410
Some of them aren't and
aren't good musicians.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.300
So, I mean, you don't know
whether someone is a high

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.480
school band member just
by being a student.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.950
All students are
good musicians.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.840
Once again, you know, this
could be an example.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.410
There could be people out here
who are students, the yellow

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:57.170
could be students.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:58.330
There could be people
who are students

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.110
who aren't good musicians.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.600
This statement doesn't in
any way constrain that.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.150
So let's get rid of that.

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.600
All high school band members
are good musicians.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.140
Well, let's look at
this Venn diagram.

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.680
I mean, that's almost like
a restating of what they

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.790
already told us.

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:15.070
All high school band members
have to be good musicians

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.260
because they told us, if you're
in the high school

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.190
band, then you're
a good musician.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.430
So it's almost like repeating
the same statement twice, but

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.940
the answer is D.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:30.050
Problem 19.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:31.910
Let me erase this one.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.200
This looks like another
one that I'm going to

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.400
have to copy and paste.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.520
OK, copied it.

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:47.270
OK, let me do a dark color.

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:49.930
The chart below shows an
expression evaluated for four

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.500
different values of x.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.000
When x is equal to 1, x squared
plus x plus 5, right.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.550
1 plus 1 plus 5 is 7.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:59.810
When x is equal to 2, then 2
squared plus 2 plus 5 is 11.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:01.060
Fair enough.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.740
Josiah or Hosiah, I don't know
how to pronounce that,

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.170
concluded that for all positive
values of x, x

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:14.220
squared plus x plus 5 produces
a prime number.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:21.440
Which value of x serves as
a counterexample to prove

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.180
Josiah's conclusion false?

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:27.580
So a counterexamples says-- he
says that whenever I put any

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.840
positive number here, I get
a prime number here.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.650
We have to say which one
proves him false?

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:41.605
If you put 5 there, what is-- 5
squared is 25 plus 5 plus 5,

00:08:41.605 --> 00:08:43.159
and what is that equal to?

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:45.930
That's equal to 35.

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:47.960
So that's a counterexample
right there.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:52.930
If x is equal to 5, I produce
35, which is not a prime

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:55.510
number, not prime.

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:02.130
So clearly, his statement, his
conclusion, was incorrect,

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:04.480
that when you put a positive
number here, it doesn't always

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.540
produce a prime number.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:06.500
That was his conclusion.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:07.740
This one isn't prime.

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:11.040
So statement A is a
counterexample, or the number

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.740
5 is a counterexample here.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:21.490
Next problem, problem 20.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:24.870
OK, this is one of those where
we have to pinpoint the

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.120
incorrect step.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.250
John's solution to an equation
is given below.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.950
For which step of real numbers
did-- oh, which property of

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:37.240
real numbers did John
use for step 2?

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.430
OK, so we don't even have
to look at step 1.

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:40.650
We just have to say,
OK, how did he get

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:42.290
from there to there?

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:47.810
So when you look at this, when
you say x plus 2 times x plus

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:52.940
3 is equal to 0, you're saying
some number x plus 2 times

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.640
some other number x plus
3 is equal to 0.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.060
So that's like saying some
number times some other number

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.100
is equal to 0.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.250
So that means that one of those
numbers or both of them

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:04.440
have to be equal
to zero, right?

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.610
Because the only way to get
zero is if one of these or

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.590
both of these have to
be equal to zero.

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:11.250
And that's where he gets this
conclusion that either x plus

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:13.830
2 has to be 0 or
x plus 3 is 0.

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:15.090
They're both zero.

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:16.560
So let's see how they--
what do they call it?

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.770
Multiplication property
of equality.

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:22.020
I don't even know
what that means.

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:23.930
Zero property of
multiplication?

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.690
This seems like the closest
one for me so far.

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:30.570
That anything times zero is zero
Or for two things to be

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:32.580
multiplied to equal zero,
at least one of

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:33.750
them has to be zero.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.640
And that's what this
is right here.

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.200
Commutative property
of multiplication?

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:37.890
No, that's not it.

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:40.160
Distributive property of
multiplication over addition?

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.840
No, we're not doing anything
like that.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.010
If we went from this step
to that step where we're

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:46.730
multiplying it, that might
have been, because you're

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:48.256
really just doing the
distributive property, but I

00:10:48.256 --> 00:10:49.020
don't want to confuse you.

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.070
Yeah, we're just saying that
if two numbers when you

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:53.100
multiply them equal zero,
one of them have

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:53.850
to be equal to zero.

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:59.690
And I guess the label for that
is the zero product property

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:00.970
of multiplication.

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:03.120
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
