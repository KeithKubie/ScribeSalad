00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.120
- [Instructor] Images
of a newly-discovered

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.830
species of macaque show
the monkeys grooming,

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.850
eating, and climbing.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.820
Now, that seems reasonable.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:10.860
Let's look at the other choices

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.880
just to be sure that we can rule them out.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.310
Images of a newly-discovered
species of macaque

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.210
show the monkeys grooming,
eating, and climb.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.700
No, that's not gonna be right at all.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.140
If you had climb, grooming, it's the,

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.930
you just have to look
at the verb form here.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.060
So, here, we have the
present participle, grooming,

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.787
then we have present participle, eating,

00:00:32.787 --> 00:00:34.960
and then, we have present
participle, climbing.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.840
We have the same verb
form for each of these,

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.070
grooming, eating, and climbing,

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.550
and so, that feels good.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.610
If we instead replace climbing with climb,

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.540
we have a different, we have
a different form of the verb.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.970
If we want to get technical,

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.930
we're breaking the parallel structure,

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.000
that, all of a sudden, if this was climb,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.910
it's not the same verb form
as grooming and eating,

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.640
so, I definitely want to rule that out.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.710
And same thing with having climbed.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.040
So, the monkeys grooming,
eating, and having climbed?

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.820
No, it's a different,
it's a different form.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.920
So, the monkeys grooming,
eating, and climbed?

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.080
Once again, different form.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.943
No change is feeling good.
