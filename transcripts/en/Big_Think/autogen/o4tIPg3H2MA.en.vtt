the future is very hard to see where the

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049
the future is very hard to see where the
 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.799
the future is very hard to see where the
world is going and most ideas die and

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809
world is going and most ideas die and
 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.529
world is going and most ideas die and
even really good ideas don't last so

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:12.539
even really good ideas don't last so
 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:14.900
even really good ideas don't last so
just as an example if you look at the

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910
just as an example if you look at the
 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.560
just as an example if you look at the
BlackBerry phone market share you'll see

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570
BlackBerry phone market share you'll see
 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.970
BlackBerry phone market share you'll see
that they were doing really well for a

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980
that they were doing really well for a
 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.560
that they were doing really well for a
while and then they just tanked out why

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570
while and then they just tanked out why
 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.140
while and then they just tanked out why
because they had a good idea which was

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150
because they had a good idea which was
 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.330
because they had a good idea which was
the physical keyboard on the phone but

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340
the physical keyboard on the phone but
 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.610
the physical keyboard on the phone but
that didn't last they they held on to a

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:28.620
that didn't last they they held on to a
 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.790
that didn't last they they held on to a
good idea a little bit too long and this

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800
good idea a little bit too long and this
 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.310
good idea a little bit too long and this
is something that creative companies

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320
is something that creative companies
 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.700
is something that creative companies
need to be aware of all the time is this

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710
need to be aware of all the time is this
 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.529
need to be aware of all the time is this
constant updating in other words they've

00:00:39.529 --> 00:00:39.539
constant updating in other words they've
 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:42.889
constant updating in other words they've
got some great thing that's working but

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899
got some great thing that's working but
 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.049
got some great thing that's working but
it's not going to last and they need to

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059
it's not going to last and they need to
 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.180
it's not going to last and they need to
keep updating this is why companies put

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190
keep updating this is why companies put
 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.799
keep updating this is why companies put
out their new and improved models all

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809
out their new and improved models all
 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.649
out their new and improved models all
the time we're now on the iPhone 10 and

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:51.659
the time we're now on the iPhone 10 and
 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:53.509
the time we're now on the iPhone 10 and
it's gonna keep going because you can't

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:53.519
it's gonna keep going because you can't
 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:55.160
it's gonna keep going because you can't
put out something great and then say

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170
put out something great and then say
 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.889
put out something great and then say
alright I think we're done so the

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899
alright I think we're done so the
 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.789
alright I think we're done so the
challenge for companies is that it's

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:01.799
challenge for companies is that it's
 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:04.310
challenge for companies is that it's
hard to know what's going to stick and

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320
hard to know what's going to stick and
 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.670
hard to know what's going to stick and
this is because if you do something

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680
this is because if you do something
 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.070
this is because if you do something
that's you know too close to what you've

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080
that's you know too close to what you've
 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.680
that's you know too close to what you've
done before your audience will be bored

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690
done before your audience will be bored
 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.780
done before your audience will be bored
if you do something that's too wacky

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790
if you do something that's too wacky
 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.330
if you do something that's too wacky
then no one's going to follow you there

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340
then no one's going to follow you there
 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.340
then no one's going to follow you there
and so companies need to figure out how

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350
and so companies need to figure out how
 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.800
and so companies need to figure out how
to feel out the border of the possible

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810
to feel out the border of the possible
 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.530
to feel out the border of the possible
and this is something that good

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540
and this is something that good
 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.930
and this is something that good
companies work on all the time the

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940
companies work on all the time the
 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.660
companies work on all the time the
solution is to proliferate options the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670
solution is to proliferate options the
 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.700
solution is to proliferate options the
solution is to put out lots of options

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710
solution is to put out lots of options
 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.190
solution is to put out lots of options
and those options should actually be at

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200
and those options should actually be at
 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.170
and those options should actually be at
different distances from community

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180
different distances from community
 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.080
different distances from community

this is this is what companies good
companies try to do is cover that
