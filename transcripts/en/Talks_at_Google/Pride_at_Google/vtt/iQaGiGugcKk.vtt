00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.260
ALEX: Welcome to this event.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.420
Another series in the Gayglers
pride month, so happy pride

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.490
month everyone!

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:11.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.090
ALEX: Pride is in fact the
entire month long, and not

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.640
just one debaucherous weekend.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.640
So it's my pleasure today
to introduce two leading

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.460
advocates in the gay civil
rights movement, Kris Perry

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.770
and Sandy Stier.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.290
They have been at the forefront
of the Prop 8

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.760
litigation battle and we're very
honored to have them with

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.940
us here today.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.500
They've been together since '97,
were married in 2004, and

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.410
have raised-- perhaps their
greatest achievement--

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.610
four boys together.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.580
The two youngest ones just
graduated last weekend.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.990
Just in time to recognize
Supreme Court decisions that

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.140
will be coming down next week.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.780
The Supreme Court is taking
their time and is going to

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.320
roll out momentous decisions
altogether next week on gay

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.420
marriage, Voting Rights Act,
affirmative action.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.420
So next week is going
to be very exciting.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.750
Kris is executive director of
the First Five Years Fund,

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.750
which is a national organization
that focuses on

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.450
investments in quality early
childhood education programs

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.100
for disadvantaged children.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.520
And Sandy, on the far right, is
a director of information

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.170
systems for Alameda County
Health Care Services Agency.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.330
And I'm not going to tell you
too much about their story,

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.340
because they're going to do a
much better job of telling it

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.640
themselves.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.160
So I'll hand it off
to you guys.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.540
Thank you so much.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.540
SANDY STIER: Thank you
for having us.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.870
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.650
SANDY STIER: So first of all,
I'd like to say, if you want

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.600
to call Kris, "Perry,"
feel free.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.730
Because she is now known as
"Perry" to the broader

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.270
community and to the media.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.760
We're so happy to be here and to
talk to you about where we

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.770
are with the case for
marriage equality.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.960
It's been a great journey
and an exciting one.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.530
And we feel very privileged to
get to be in the position of

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.770
representing such an important
civil rights issue.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.640
Today we'd like to take you
through some different parts

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.830
of the case and show you
a couple video clips.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:10.740
Hopefully they'll
be interesting.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.720
We want to use most of our time
for Q&amp;A to hear from you

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.050
and get a better idea of what
your questions are, and what

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.820
your concerns are, and how you
view this particular case.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.860
So starting off, we have this
picture of us in front of the

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:25.970
Supreme Court.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.650
We were there in March
of this year.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.940
The transcripts are
available online.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.310
You can Google them
if you want to.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.640
They're quite interesting.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.250
We were there with our kids and
our legal team, including

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.700
Enrique Monagas, who is
here with us today.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.960
So he's going to help field some
of the legal questions,

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.230
if you have anything
you want to ask.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.600
And let's go ahead
and get going.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.300
KRIS PERRY: So nothing of this
scale and scope is possible

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.630
with just a couple of people.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.400
We're part of a really large
team, made up of funders, and

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.220
attorneys, and advocates.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.650
What you see here before you
are just a sampling of the

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:01.850
people that have been
invested in this

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.120
from the very beginning.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.370
The Reiners, Michelle and Rob
Reiner, along with Dustin

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.630
Lance Black, and Bruce Cohen
and Cleve Jones, are on the

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.820
board of the American Foundation
for Equal Rights.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.820
And have made it their mission
to not only contribute

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.730
financially, but to help others
contribute financially.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.360
And that, in fact, has been
one of the most important

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.560
roles in this.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.470
A case that takes four years
to travel through the legal

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.990
system generates some legal
fees, even when people are

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.740
being generous with their time,
including pro bono.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.860
But those board members have
done a huge amount to help

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:34.890
this movement.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.440
And then above them, you can see
the other plaintiffs, Jeff

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.690
and Paul, next to Chad Griffin,
who has since moved

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.300
on to the human rights
campaign.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.420
And our attorneys, David Boies
and Ted Olson, along with

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.310
Christina Shockey and Adam
Umhoefer, who are also some of

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.710
the founding members
of the American

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.100
Foundation of Equal Rights.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.220
But one of more fun stories in
all of this is how did Sandy

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.620
and I actually come to be
a part of this team?

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:57.730
We are not Hollywood

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.810
A-listers, we are not attorneys.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.720
And we are not long-time,
legendary, gay rights

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.330
activists like Cleve Jones.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.120
We are, in fact, just ordinary
people that were busy raising

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.140
our families and going
to work every day.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.270
When we learned that there was
possibly going to be a

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.690
challenge to Proposition 8.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.120
And we learned that through our
friend, Chad Griffin, who

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.720
at the time, was working with
Rob Reiner in Los Angeles on a

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.380
number of other political
issues.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.680
Not the least of which was early
childhood education,

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.320
which is what I have dedicated
my career toward.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.480
And I was on a phone call with
Chad just out of the blue one

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.090
day, and he mentioned that he
was putting a group of people

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.620
together because they were
really upset about how

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.230
Proposition 8 had passed.

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.580
And I asked him a little bit
about it and he said, well,

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.540
Rob and I were at lunch with
Michelle and we were talking

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.530
about how angry we were.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.140
And if you know the Reiners,
they tend to be rather loud.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.720
So apparently, they
were overheard.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.850
And they were overheard at the
polo lounge by someone that

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.670
used to be related to Ted Olson,
a former sister-in-law.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.110
And she came over and said, you
may not believe this, but

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.430
there is someone in Washington
DC who cares about this, who

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.760
would probably help you.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.750
And they said, who?

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.000
And she said, Ted Olson.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.460
And they all said, really?

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.740
Ted Olson, as in "Bush
v. Gore" Ted Olson?

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.120
And they said, yes.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.930
And that's how this all began.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.300
Chad knew me, Chad ended
up meeting Ted.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.100
I know Sandy.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.560
And we ended up--

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.920
we lived together, we actually
know each other quite well--

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.020
and so really, these things came
together rather quickly,

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.280
these relationships.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.560
And I wanted to be sure that you
understood how we ended up

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.030
in this, because we are not
like the rest of them.

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.380
ALEX: And can you walk us
through your decision making

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.450
process on that a little bit?

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.460
Because I think here we've
got a room of some young,

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.800
aspiring, perhaps future civil
rights leaders here.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.700
And it takes a lot of courage
to put yourself in the

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.460
spotlight, put your
name on the line.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.900
What was your decision making
process in deciding to step up

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:53.380
and do that?

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.190
I mean there are lots of angry
people out there, but it's

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.000
really easy to be angry
in our living rooms.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.130
SANDY STIER: Yeah, well
we're particularly

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.600
angry, because we have--

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.660
as we said, a lot of
kids-- and so we're

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.200
mad most of the time.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.550
It's getting better
now that they're

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.140
graduating and moving on.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.590
But it was actually a fairly
quick and easy decision for us

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:11.100
on some level.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.090
And it's really because we felt
so strongly that marriage

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.650
should be available to us and
to everybody in our country.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.730
And that voting on our rights
just seem completely

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:20.920
fundamentally wrong.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.940
So we had such a problem with
Proposition 8 being on the

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.050
ballot in the first place.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.440
Even being part of the voting
process and it didn't make any

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.000
sense to us.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.420
And then when we heard about
this possible legal challenge,

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.460
we both said, oh my gosh,
what a great place

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.230
to address the issue.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:36.620
We have to be protected.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.440
We're a minority, we need to be

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.840
protected from the majority.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.690
So for us, as individuals, I
think we both came fairly

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.620
quickly to feel very supportive
of this initiative,

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.530
approaching it in this way.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.420
In terms of the family, we
decided, between the two of

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.890
us, that we felt comfortable
moving forward.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:52.870
And we believed in it.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.580
And we thought it was the right
team, and the right

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.110
challenge, and the
right players.

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.940
And then we just went down the
row of kids and asked each one

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.670
individually, how would
you feel about it?

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:05.430
Because we felt strongly that if
any one of the boys didn't

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:08.200
feel comfortable with our being
involved in it, that we

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:08.730
wouldn't do it.

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:10.130
Because it does impact
them, as well.

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.730
Even though they're tangential,
there's no way of

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:14.680
getting out of the fact that
it does impact them.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.170
And the boys were all really
very supportive.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.720
In part, because they are
somewhat narcissistic, to be

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.570
totally honest.

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:23.840
What do you think about
us being in the case?

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.210
Well, that's fine, but
I need some money.

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:26.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.860
SANDY STIER: Like, OK.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.190
And yeah, I believe it and I
think it's the right thing to

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:34.280
do, but I'm not saying that just
for you, I'm saying it

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:34.610
for society.

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.550
I'm like, OK, be politically
correct.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:37.440
That's totally fine.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.580
So the boys were supportive of
it and that was all we needed.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.520
We didn't really look for
anybody else's approval, we

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.650
didn't check in with the
rest of our families.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:45.870
Just our kids and each other.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.230
And then we moved forward.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:51.410
KRIS PERRY: The courage part,
though, is sometimes, you can

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:54.980
mistake thinking you're signing
up for something that

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.670
was more like the other
challenges had been, which is

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:01.000
more of an administrative
process that seemed--

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.610
actually it was still a big
leap of faith for us to be

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:06.420
involved in something that
would've been more about a

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:07.730
paper-driven driven process--

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.210
but it became a very
people-driven process.

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:13.770
And I feel really fortunate that
we were supported by a

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:17.630
group of lawyers and advocates
that really helped us move

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:21.700
from something more quiet to
something a little bit louder.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.170
And I would just say to all of
you, as you go through your

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.070
lives and you find yourself in
situations where you feel that

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:30.230
you have not been treated
fairly, and you have not been

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:34.460
given protection, and you are
not in a situation that is

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.580
really acceptable to you, there
are numerous ways to

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:38.640
resolve that problem.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.650
One of which is to hire lawyers
and go through the

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:41.350
court system.

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:43.179
But it is not the only way.

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:46.140
And, in fact, if it weren't for
years and years, decades

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:49.330
really, of other people standing
up, like Harvey Milk,

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.490
and Cleve Jones, and
Phyllis and Del.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:55.320
And so many others fighting
back on a more political

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.030
front, or through a grassroots
advocacy, a legal challenge

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.350
would have seemed really
premature.

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:02.820
Or really ill-advised.

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.720
So it's really a combination
of events that lead to a

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.570
moment in time, like this,
where we know that

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:11.400
everything's pulling in favor
of gay marriage now.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.540
And so much is shifting.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:16.150
But it's really a rare time to
see a social movement happen

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:17.570
within a few years.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:20.720
But it's really after
many years.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.590
So moving past who some of the
players are and where we've

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:27.220
been, we wanted to talk a little
bit about what actually

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:31.150
happened in that trial that we
ended up being a part of.

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:34.160
There were many, many witnesses
for our side.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.750
People that came to court and
said, this is why Proposition

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:40.890
8 is harmful and
unconstitutional.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:45.200
And the witnesses really were
on the full spectrum of

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:51.560
experts from Yale and Harvard
and UC Berkeley and UC Davis.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.790
And people that had been
studying sociology and

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:58.040
political power and on the
institution of marriage,

00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.605
frankly, for their
entire careers.

00:09:59.605 --> 00:10:03.710
They were there to testify on
behalf of our team, as well as

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:07.060
laypeople, like Sandy and I,
Jeff and Paul, the mayor of

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:11.610
San Diego, and even someone
that had been put through

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.410
reparative therapy.

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:17.500
So we had a great blend of real
stories from real people,

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:23.500
as well as witnesses from
all over the world.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.990
The more telling piece of the
story was how few witnesses

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:27.750
the other side had.

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:30.830
And I'll let Sandy talk about
the two witnesses that the

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:31.600
other side had.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.460
And just when you look at the
numbers, it comes out very

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:36.160
unbalanced.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.710
SANDY STIER: Right so, there's
nothing like being on the

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:39.740
winning team, right?

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:43.490
And it was very clear in court
in no time that we were

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:44.640
definitely on the
winning team.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.190
Not only did we have great
expert witnesses, but they

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:51.510
talked about some of those
salient arguments that could

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:55.570
be presented, in terms of
economics and the political

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:58.620
process, and how really
under-represented gays are.

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.950
And violence against gay people,
and how many different

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:04.040
rights are associated with
marriage, including adoption,

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.850
immigration, so many
different things.

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:07.710
And how important it is
to have equality.

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:09.520
Well, on the other side, they
really couldn't drum up any

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:13.440
good expert witnesses, because
there really aren't any.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.260
The ones that they did bring
forth, number one was David

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.490
Blankenhorn, and some of you
may have heard of him.

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:21.440
He kind of has switched sides
since he did his testimony.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.300
And, in fact, he
really switched

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:25.450
sides during the trial.

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:26.160
It's an unusual thing.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.210
And you're going to see a little
bit of that in a second

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:30.440
in one of these clips.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:35.270
His expertise, even though he
ran an organization for

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.980
pro-traditional family, his
expertise was actually

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:42.220
Victorian wood cabinetry.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.310
And that's where he had
peer-reviewed articles,

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:46.920
Victorian wood cabinetry, but
unfortunately, you can't

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.740
really take the knowledge from
Victorian wood cabinetry

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:53.810
making and apply it to equal
rights or family structure.

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:56.260
So that was a very awkward
situation for them.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.000
And then the other person that
they brought forth actually

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.790
had to be subpoenaed to be
involved in the trial, because

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:03.550
after his deposition
with David Boies--

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:06.960
which is not a fun experience
in anyone's life.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.860
I can assure you that having
David Boies depose you, would

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:11.920
be incredibly difficult.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.230
He is like a surgeon
in a courtroom, if

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:17.300
that makes any sense.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:20.970
And you actually almost felt
empathic for witnesses that

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:23.590
testified in ways that you
didn't agree with.

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:26.160
I started to feel empathy for
them, because it would be so

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.280
difficult to be on the stand
with David Boies.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.640
KRIS PERRY: They did have two
witnesses who tried really

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:36.040
hard, and it was an interesting
day when

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:36.790
they were up there--

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:37.770
days.

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:40.360
But what's great about the case,
so for, we'll look at

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:44.270
the next slide, is that even
though we were there in argue

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:47.160
for our due process and equal
protection rights and how Prop

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.030
8 violated both of
those things.

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:52.180
I feel like it's hard to
synthesize a three week trial

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:53.530
into some simple concepts.

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:55.760
But for the purpose of moving
through this quickly and

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.450
helping you understand where the
primary arguments centered

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:01.030
around, due process and equal
protection were both.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:04.890
And we felt that the witnesses
made the case that marriage is

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:06.830
a fundamental right.

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.460
That it is tied to your
life, liberty,

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:09.970
and pursuit of happiness.

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:12.680
And that for individuals who
are not allowed access to

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.740
those fundamental rights,
their lives are really

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:16.420
diminished.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.340
The quality of your life is
greatly diminished by not

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:22.280
having the power to say
"I do" as a grown-up.

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:25.110
It is the most important
decision you make as an adult,

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:27.120
who you choose to spend
your life with.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:31.440
And Nancy Cott made the argument
that during slavery,

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:35.730
one of the key features, one of
the most important rights

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:38.170
that the slaves wanted was
the right to marry.

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:40.990
Because if you don't have the
full force of the phrase "I

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:45.520
do" as a free person, then you
are not like other people.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.270
And everyone knows it.

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:49.340
One of the things that we
pointed out in our testimony

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:52.720
was how humiliating it can be as
a lesbian or gay person who

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.930
wants to marry, to be in the
company of those who can.

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:59.290
They know that you are not an
adult the way that they are.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:02.250
And that you are viewed as a
second class citizen by people

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:05.730
you work with, by your own
family, by your own children.

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:08.240
And, frankly, people that
are running government.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.550
And it is a very difficult
way to live.

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:12.710
To have people know that
you are not capable

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:14.400
of making that decision.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.760
So what was important about
the case was for so many

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.740
experts to come in and show
how it's harmful to us

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:22.540
psychologically, financially,
and in so many ways.

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:26.720
So what was great was even
though the trial itself was

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:30.330
not live streamed like this
talk is right now.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:31.860
It was captured in
transcripts.

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:35.540
Those transcripts were later
turned into a play called 8.

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:41.250
And we wanted to show you, Alex,
a couple clips from the

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:43.770
play 8, so that you could sort
of get the flavor of what was

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:45.602
happening in the courtroom.

00:14:45.602 --> 00:14:47.350
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:49.960
-It's easy for people who want
to deprive gays and lesbians

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.670
of their rights to make all
kinds of statements in

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:55.130
campaign literature, or on
TV, where they can't be

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:57.410
cross-examined.

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:00.570
But the witness stand is
a lonely place to lie.

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:08.480
-You cannot say, after the fact,
we are going to take

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.900
away the constitutional right
to liberty, privacy,

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:15.070
association that we already
tell you have.

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:16.870
That is not acceptable.

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:19.360
-I am asking you to tell
me how it would harm

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.560
opposite sex marriages.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:25.440
-All right, your honor, my
answer is, I don't know.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:29.750
-How convinced are you
that you are gay?

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:34.800
-I'm convinced because at 47
years old, I have fallen in

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.335
love one time.

00:15:37.335 --> 00:15:41.170
It is with Kris.

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:43.590
-We would love to have a family,
but the timeline for

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:47.060
us has always been,
marriage first.

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:49.940
-You two are about the most
responsible, important,

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:52.790
meaningful things I will ever
do in my whole life.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:56.130
And don't you ever let anyone
ever make you feel any

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:57.780
different, you got it?

00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:58.480
-Yes, Mom.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.730
-Yes, Mom.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:06.230
-We put fear and prejudice
on trial.

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:11.770
-We put fear and prejudice
on trial.

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:13.495
-We put fear and prejudice
on trial.

00:16:13.495 --> 00:16:17.658
-We put fear and prejudice
on trial.

00:16:17.658 --> 00:16:20.300
-The word marriage
has a meaning.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:23.045
If it wasn't so important, we
wouldn't be here today.

00:16:23.045 --> 00:16:24.230
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:27.440
SANDY STIER: So that was just
a brief clip with just a few

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.895
little actors that you
may have recognized.

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:35.311
And Jamie Lee Curtis did a
fantastic job playing me.

00:16:35.311 --> 00:16:37.230
You probably noticed that
physical resemblance.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:40.850
That was an amazing thing.

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:43.180
It was actually used as a
fundraiser for the case, which

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.970
is great, but also, more
importantly, to really educate

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:47.760
different people and different
audiences about what happened

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:48.650
in that trial.

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:50.570
And to really bring the most
salient points and the most

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:54.540
salient arguments into a kind
of venue where you could

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.060
really absorb it.

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:58.690
So this play has been in many,
many colleges, community

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:02.900
colleges, high schools,
community theaters, big, huge

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:04.079
theaters, all over
the country.

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:05.500
And even in different
countries.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:06.240
And it's great.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.800
It's in Montana, it's in Utah.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:10.130
It's in wonderful little pockets
of the country that

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:12.250
really need to see this
kind of information.

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:16.150
And we're really grateful that
Lance put this together and

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:18.500
took advantage of the fact
that they wouldn't allow

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:21.089
cameras in the courtroom during
the trial, which is

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:23.410
something that happened
on the very first day.

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:27.700
So moving on, the case timeline
and public opinion.

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:29.510
This is just kind of a brief
graphic of where

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:30.690
the case has been.

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:33.170
We did enter this case
four years ago.

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:35.900
We had a trial in
January of 2011.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.330
Nearly a three week trial.

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:38.640
We won.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.630
We went to appeal.

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:42.030
And we won again.

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:45.280
And then we had a detour at the
California Supreme Court.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.260
And finally ended up
in the federal

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:48.730
Supreme Court in March.

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:50.780
And now, of course, we're
waiting for a ruling and, as

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:53.640
you can see, public opinion
has gone nowhere but up,

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.710
really, in terms of supporting
gay marriage since we began

00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:58.530
this process.

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:00.530
KRIS PERRY: So we wanted to show
you one other video clip

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:03.830
of some of the actual people,
not the actors that played

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:07.040
people in the trial, which was
a way of taking you back four

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.000
years and showing you some of
the exciting things that

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:09.730
happened in the courtroom.

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:11.190
And why we won.

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:14.080
So many witnesses, so much
powerful testimony.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.350
But now, you have the
combination of not only that,

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:19.370
but the shift in public opinion
combined with what

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:20.260
happened in the courtroom.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.050
And now all culminating in what
we hope will be a very

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:24.560
positive ruling next week.

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.980
So when we went to Washington DC
a couple of months ago for

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:33.280
the hearing to watch Ted Olson
and others argue this case, we

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.840
were accompanied
by many others.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:35.760
So we'll show you a little
bit about what

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:36.746
happened on that day.

00:18:36.746 --> 00:18:37.732
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:18:37.732 --> 00:18:44.650
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:46.540
-Well, here it is, the day
before we go to the Supreme

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:49.000
Court to hear Ted Olson, and
the Solicitor General argue

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.660
our case in front of
the Supreme Court.

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:52.993
So today, in order to get ready,
we're going to going to

00:18:52.993 --> 00:18:56.000
the National Archives to see the
US Constitution, which is

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.690
a huge highlight for both Sandy
and I and our kids.

00:18:58.690 --> 00:18:59.510
We're definitely excited
to be here.

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:01.290
We're proud to be here.

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:03.720
We're certainly nervous.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.030
Cautiously optimistic, but most

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:07.380
importantly, we're hopeful.

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.390
-Right, now, we're just
preparing for the argument.

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:13.150
And it's to go through and make
sure that we have every

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:15.880
possible question, every
possible argument the other

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.890
side can come up with and we've
done as much as we can

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:20.320
to prepare and respond
to those.

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.040
-When we set up four years ago,
we said we were going to

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.340
make this case before
the Supreme Court.

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:26.720
Before the highest court
in the land.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:31.420
And I think we're all going to
be just in awe to watch Ted

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.170
Olson up there making
our case.

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:36.250
-It's a dialogue among
the justices.

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:39.670
They use their questions to
explore issues, so you can't

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:41.360
read too much into anything.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:44.860
-We think history will look back
and feel proud that our

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.450
country came together to support
equality for all

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:50.060
people and we're just so
grateful that we get to be a

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:52.790
part of this very important
civil rights issue.

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:56.605
-We're Kris and Sandy's sons,
so we just tag along for the

00:19:56.605 --> 00:19:58.160
ride and try to make
them look good.

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.320
I think Elliott and I are
immensely proud of our moms

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.730
and what they're doing.

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:05.840
-Tomorrow morning, we'll get up
very early and we will make

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.056
our way to the Supreme Court.

00:20:08.056 --> 00:20:09.670
Sounds strange even saying
it out loud.

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:12.165
-We have great clients.

00:20:12.165 --> 00:20:13.230
They are in love.

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:14.580
They want to get married.

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.340
This is a defining civil
rights issue of our

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:18.350
generation.

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:21.306
It is a time that I
think we advance

00:20:21.306 --> 00:20:24.020
the agenda of equality.

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:27.070
Not just for gays and lesbians,
but for everybody.

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:32.880
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.980
-It's freezing, but,
of course, I'm so

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:36.830
excited to be here.

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:39.270
-We've been on the case for a
very, very long time and it's

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:40.000
a great journey.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.250
And we've accomplished
a lot so far.

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:44.660
-I'm trying to wrap my head
around the fact that this is

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:45.790
actually real and happening.

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:49.340
And that we're here, but it's
incredibly exciting and

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:50.750
historic morning.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:53.410
-This is exactly what our
judicial system is for.

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:55.050
And this is where we should
be on this day.

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:03.500
-A lot of people have made
this possible by their

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.674
generous support.

00:21:05.674 --> 00:21:07.850
And we want to thank them and
really want and thank the

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:10.130
millions of people around the
country that have worked so

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:11.880
hard to make this possible.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:15.100
-To me, all of this work,
everything that we're doing,

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:16.570
is about the next generation.

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:19.910
So that the young people out
there who are just coming of

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:21.890
age, falling in love for
the first time, they

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:24.690
do so without judgment.

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:26.980
-I know what I'm going to
be seeing from our side.

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:30.380
Ted Olson is going to be
brilliant, as he always is.

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:34.290
And he will make the points
that we feel necessary.

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:37.580
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:38.510
-It's incredible.

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:41.374
It's a historic day.

00:21:41.374 --> 00:21:44.030
For the LGBT rights movement.

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:54.030
-I'm already very anxiously
waiting for June.

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:55.790
I'm already nervous, I'm like,
OK, do they have it yet?

00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:56.405
Did they decide it?

00:21:56.405 --> 00:21:58.220
And it's only been
ten minutes.

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:00.900
-It's a little bit of a relief,
but at the same time,

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:01.760
now we wait.

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:04.350
And we know we have to wait
for three months before we

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:08.800
find out what they've decided.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:12.665
-The most important battle, I
think, clearly has been won.

00:22:12.665 --> 00:22:16.255
The one thing thought about in
there was again, sitting in

00:22:16.255 --> 00:22:19.020
the back of Harvey's old camera
store on Castro Street

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:21.200
and Harvey saying, you've
got to come out.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.800
And it's pretty extraordinary.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.890
DUSTIN LANCE BLACK: We're
not done in this

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:26.670
movement for LGBT equality.

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:30.910
So next is get back to work and
keep fighting to make sure

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:34.410
the next generation's lives
are better than ours.

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:36.860
I think that's our
job as Americans.

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:50.090
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:53.050
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:55.860
KRIS PERRY: So I mentioned the
way public opinion has shifted

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:58.600
over the last four years and
this is just a way of showing

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.950
you how many polls
have been done.

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:04.610
Very reputable, national polls,
over the four year

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:06.970
period and how great
this trend is.

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:10.760
This is a great trend line
for us, for any movement.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:15.080
Moving on to the next slide,
showing you a little bit about

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:18.340
how the country is shifting,
in terms of legalizing

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:19.280
marriage equality.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.280
You can see which states--

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.490
the dark blue states--
do have it already.

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:26.540
Blue states, the light
blue, are obviously

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:28.290
working toward it.

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:32.020
And the gray is all the work
we still have to do.

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:34.350
Because as exciting as it is
to have New England and

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:37.170
Western states, taking a hard
look at this, look at what's

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:39.090
happening in the middle of the
country and in the south.

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:41.010
There's a lot of work to do.

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:43.454
So, Sandy, you're the
legal expert.

00:23:43.454 --> 00:23:45.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:45.900
SANDY STIER: That's right.

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:50.020
I'm so glad to be recognized
for what I really am.

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:52.160
After being in the trial for
three weeks, you feel like a

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:52.740
legal expert.

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:54.070
I actually felt like
I got a master's

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:55.530
degree in marriage equality.

00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:57.550
It's fantastic.

00:23:57.550 --> 00:23:59.260
So what could the court
decide to do?

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:02.410
Well, they could decide to do
the brave thing, which is to

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:03.500
rule on the merits
of the case.

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:04.880
That's what we hope they do.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.010
And really on the merit
of the case would

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:08.520
be a 50 state ruling.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:11.200
It's what we hope
fervently for.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.320
It's a big ask.

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.780
It's a big win.

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:18.380
And we think it's it would be
an amazing thing to have.

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:19.880
But there are different
options of what

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:20.680
could actually happen.

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:24.810
They could uphold Proposition 8,
they could decline to rule,

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:27.640
and they could, well,
there's another one

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.200
that'll pop up in a second.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.740
They could strike down
Proposition 8.

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:34.020
So if they strike down
Proposition 8, we can win a

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:34.720
couple of different ways.

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.350
The A is the merits ruling.

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:38.070
We could also win on standing.

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:40.640
which just means the proponents
didn't have

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.940
standing to bring the
case the court.

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:45.300
They could also just dismiss
the case, which is somewhat

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:48.440
unlikely, and would have a
similar impact as standing.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:52.190
Which is basically that
California would have marriage

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:56.100
equality and potentially the
states that, depending on how

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:58.267
the ruling is written,
potentially the states that

00:24:58.267 --> 00:25:00.280
had domestic partnerships.

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:03.480
If they uphold Proposition 8,
that is, of course, the worst

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:04.500
thing that could happen.

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:08.140
That means we roll
back the clock.

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:09.330
So those are the options.

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:13.675
That's my very in-depth legal
analysis on the topic.

00:25:13.675 --> 00:25:17.560
And for more information, we
have a brilliant lawyer right

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.050
here who can answer any question
that you have.

00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:22.870
KRIS PERRY: That wraps up the
part of the presentation where

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:25.590
we have pictures and
videos to show you.

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:27.750
And now we would like to
just interact with you.

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:30.500
So if the lights could come up
and we could just have a

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:33.520
conversation about the things
that you may be wanting to ask

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:37.320
that are somewhat complicated
and a little bit arcane.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:40.330
Because we showed you three
possible outcomes, but if you

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:42.660
start talking to anybody that's
a legal expert, they'll

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:45.660
tell you there are dozens
of possible outcomes.

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:48.100
And not to mention how
many different days

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:48.950
this could all occur.

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:51.070
Right now, we think the one day
they're supposed to meet

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:54.160
is Monday, but everyone says
they can't do all the cases

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.440
they have in one day, so
it'll be adding days.

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:58.990
So we have lots to look forward
to next week and we

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:01.455
would really love to just talk
to you about your questions

00:26:01.455 --> 00:26:02.920
and thoughts about this.

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.520
ALEX: What is next week going
to look like for you?

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:10.190
So once the decision's handed
down, what are you guys going

00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:10.880
to be doing?

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:15.690
And then second part to that
question, is after next week,

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:18.190
what is your political life
going to look like?

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:20.570
How are you going to
continue to be

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:22.500
politically engaged in this?

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:23.900
Are you going to take a break?

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:25.780
Which would be OK, too, because
you've done a lot of

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:28.220
work for us already.

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:32.240
But what are your thoughts
on that going forward?

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:34.360
SANDY STIER: Well, we think we
are probably going to stop

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.720
suing people, first of all.

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:41.580
We've learned that lawsuits are
long and expensive ways to

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:42.360
resolve problems.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.680
So we'll let that go for a
while, but we will always

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:46.460
fight certainly for
equal rights.

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:47.470
Now what would really help--

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:48.510
we'll be in DC next week.

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:51.010
So we're going Sunday in
anticipation of the possible

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:51.820
ruling Monday.

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:53.800
If not Monday, and they add
additional days, it could be

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:54.990
Wednesday or Thursday.

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:58.790
We really hope to be at the
Supreme Court, ideally inside,

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:00.580
and hear the decision
being read.

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:03.290
And we're really hoping that we
have something very special

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:04.340
to celebrate.

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:07.220
So we'd celebrate with our legal
team, and many of the

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:10.020
founders of the case, and of
course each other, and the

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:11.080
other plaintiffs.

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:14.280
And then we'd become fairly
involved in some of the media

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:17.420
that will happen as a result
of the ruling.

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:20.140
And its a wild and crazy
week for us.

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:24.210
And honestly, then we go right
back to our normal lives.

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:27.290
Getting kids up and making them
go to their summer jobs.

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:27.917
And all that kind of stuff.

00:27:27.917 --> 00:27:29.340
And go to jobs ourselves.

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:32.630
But we do really feel very, very
hopeful that we're going

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:33.670
to have a positive outcome.

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:36.890
It's just a matter of how big.

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:37.200
How big.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.730
And so, we're full
of anticipation.

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:43.640
KRIS PERRY: The future political
work, oddly enough,

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:46.090
we don't see this as a
political activity.

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:48.780
I know that may strike
some of you as odd.

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:52.980
It just feels like an extension
of our personal of

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:55.510
disagreement with the
law, Proposition 8.

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:57.710
And one way of resolving
that disagreement

00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:58.820
was to go to court.

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:02.790
And then we didn't take
a political path to

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:03.670
resolve this problem.

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:04.700
And others may.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:06.600
If there's a very bad outcome--
in other words,

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.240
Proposition 8 continues
to exist--

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.190
people are already talking.

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:11.890
Political people are already
talking about what they'll do

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:12.390
about that.

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:13.310
But that's their job.

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:14.690
They're full-time politicians.

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:15.940
That's what they do
for a living.

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:18.020
Or there are voters out there
that may come together and

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:19.300
decide they want to do
something about it,

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:20.580
as a group of voters.

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:22.990
But that was not really
our method.

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:25.010
We think that that actually
isn't the kind of permanent

00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:26.690
solution this deserves.

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:29.230
Other kinds of problems that
exist for lesbian and gay

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:32.200
individuals and couples are
going to continue to happen.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.400
We see already within the
immigration reform debate, how

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.980
much the gay couple,
international couple issue has

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:41.030
emerged as a sticking point
for some people.

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:43.940
We know recently HUD released
a study that shows that

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:45.910
lesbian and gay couples are
discriminated against in their

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:47.570
pursuit of housing.

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:51.860
There are other problems still
that exist around bullying and

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:54.980
even the way the K-12 education
world is viewing

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:56.830
whether or not to
teach kids about

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:58.560
different kind of families.

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:01.990
It's a really pervasive problem
to get people to

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:04.260
recognize that lesbian and gay
people, and couples, and

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:08.400
families, and kids are equal.

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.250
Equal.

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:10.150
Not less than.

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:11.230
Not better than.

00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:11.810
Equal.

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:14.330
And that will be, frankly,
something we'll probably have

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:15.650
to tackle our whole lives
because we're

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:17.030
getting rather old.

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:18.290
There's not that
much time left.

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:19.670
SANDY STIER: I'm getting
pretty old.

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:20.808
KRIS PERRY: You're pretty old.

00:29:20.808 --> 00:29:22.544
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:22.544 --> 00:29:24.970
KRIS PERRY: There's
a lot to do.

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:26.790
ALEX: And one more question
before opening it up.

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:29.030
I want to kind of step back.

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:33.990
So gay marriage has been kind of
the headliner issue in the

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:38.480
civil rights advocacy
in our community.

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:40.440
And I think it's galvanized
a lot of people.

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:44.030
It's united people within the
gay community and also our

00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:48.150
allies, in a way that's been
really great to see.

00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:50.900
And as we saw with the map,
the struggle is going to

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:55.760
continue unless the Supreme
Court goes big.

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.820
How do you think we can maintain
that unity and

00:29:58.820 --> 00:29:59.830
leverage it?

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:01.210
In addressing these
other issues?

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:03.690
There are also major
LGBT health issues.

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:06.190
Very little research has been
done about the different

00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:09.160
health challenges that our
particular communities face.

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:12.880
So that you can't even design
health programs or medical

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:17.100
care in a way that suits us
best, because there's really

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:19.030
no research and no knowledge
around it.

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:22.100
Around domestic violence, sexual
violence, bullying,

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:23.480
things like that.

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:26.710
Do you have any thoughts about
how we can maintain that unity

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:28.450
going forward?

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:29.430
KRIS PERRY: I think what--

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:31.560
we were having a great
conversation with Enrique

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:34.310
before we started, where really,
the lesbian and gay

00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:38.470
community is the most perfect
example of such a cross

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:41.220
section of the country
as a group.

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:44.240
So unlike any other minority
groups, you are different from

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.600
your family.

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.630
And so we have to create that.

00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:48.830
We have to create family.

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:52.550
And one way that happens is
we're really diverse.

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:56.200
Every racial group, both
genders, all kinds of

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:59.170
different sexual orientation,
decisions, as well as

00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:02.570
socioeconomic, people dealing
with different health issues.

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:05.800
We are full blown cross
section of the

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.290
country, of the world.

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:10.330
And in some ways, we are
instructive to other groups

00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:14.110
that are dealing with issues,
some of which you named, as a

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:15.950
way to come together
as a coalition.

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:20.800
And what was most probably
catalytic and interesting

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:23.300
about this case was
a bipartisan

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:24.690
approach to a problem.

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:27.440
Which, right now, seems to be
one of the hardest things for

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.430
people to do in this country
is to come together across

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:33.330
party lines, but frankly, that's
not the only way to

00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:34.140
solve problems.

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:36.670
And I think what's been really
helpful for Sandy and I is to

00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:41.010
see ourselves as part of this
really big quilt of people and

00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:42.510
different approaches.

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:44.530
And I think if we could take
that whole group and keep

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:46.830
moving forward to solve new
problems together, we'll solve

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:48.640
more problems together.

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.300
AUDIENCE: I, probably like
many of us, had kind of a

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:53.600
civics high school view
of the Supreme Court.

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:56.170
Stone building with
guys in robes.

00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:58.380
But a bunch of us at Google
sat and listened to the

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:00.270
transcripts together in a room,
like the moment they

00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:01.030
were released.

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:04.180
And I know, for me, there was
this sudden like, wait a

00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:06.460
minute, this isn't abstract,
this is about me.

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:09.340
So I'm wondering like if that
happened to me, what happened

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:11.680
to you, personally, sitting
in the Supreme Court?

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.840
Did that change your view
of the Supreme Court?

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:14.780
Or of process?

00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:17.160
Or of what it means?

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.280
SANDY STIER: You know, it did.

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:19.710
Really.

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:22.910
It's fascinating being in the
Supreme Court and to see the

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:25.750
energy of others trying to get
to the court, as well.

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:28.180
For four days, there were people
camping out trying to

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:30.960
get those very few public
spots in the court.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.400
And it was snowing.

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.440
It was a rough time.

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:37.250
But to go into the courtroom,
it's very highly structured.

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:39.940
There's a lot of security and
it's a very formal way of

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:41.000
entering the courtroom.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.240
We weren't seated with the other
plaintiffs or anybody in

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:44.080
our team, necessarily.

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:46.335
We're just seated in the general
audience, but Kris and

00:32:46.335 --> 00:32:48.000
I were fortunate so we
could sit together.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.590
It was actually a
little bit hard.

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:53.635
But being in the courtroom, it's
an intimate environment.

00:32:53.635 --> 00:32:54.800
I don't know if you've
ever been into the

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:55.700
Supreme Court before.

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:57.470
It's of course available
for public tour.

00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:59.180
But it's not a huge courtroom.

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:00.710
It's a fairly small courtroom.

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:02.450
Very grand.

00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:03.975
Very beautiful.

00:33:03.975 --> 00:33:07.220
But from any place that you're
sitting, you feel like you

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:08.730
could really see the justices.

00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:10.780
You can see the look
on their face.

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:12.490
And we had fairly good
seats, actually.

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:14.290
We were towards the front,
and towards the middle.

00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:17.800
And you could really view
their expression as they

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:20.690
spoke, or as they had an
emotional response to what

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:23.150
somebody else on
the bench said.

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:27.590
And I guess I always knew that
just from the lawyers telling

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:30.520
us how the court works, it's
a one hour hearing.

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:31.820
We knew that, of course.

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:34.140
And then our side only had 30
minutes and out of our 30

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:36.360
minutes, we had 10 minutes
that would be used by the

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:38.180
Solicitor General for
the White House,

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:39.410
which is a good thing.

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:42.090
But Ted Olson had 20 minutes
to make his argument.

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:43.700
That's a very short
amount of time.

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:45.410
And he was into about the
first sentence of his

00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:47.070
argument, when he was
immediately interrupted by one

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:48.200
of the justices.

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:50.030
And that's how the
whole thing goes.

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:52.340
So regardless of what beautiful
thing you've planned

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:53.810
to say, it will be
interrupted.

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:57.980
And then you'll immediately be
responding to questions.

00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:00.310
And so the justices immediately
took them down

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:01.660
into the path of standing--

00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:03.170
around the issue of standing--

00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:05.730
as they did with Charles Cooper,
the lead attorney on

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:07.010
the other side, as well.

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:08.455
And we spent a lot of
time on standing.

00:34:08.455 --> 00:34:09.800
I didn't expect that.

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.699
And that was a little
disconcerting, actually.

00:34:11.699 --> 00:34:14.909
Because we kept thinking, let's
talk about the merits,

00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:16.889
let's talk about the most
important things, let's talk

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:18.120
about equal protection.

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:20.100
We don't want to talk about
standing for too long, because

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:23.590
we don't want to miss the most
important points that Ted is

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:25.130
going to make today.

00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:27.590
So that was one thing, that
the justices really

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:28.960
orchestrate the courtroom.

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.600
And the Chief Justice
really is clearly in

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:33.409
charge of the courtroom.

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:36.550
And then some of the comments
the justices made.

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:38.900
If you listen to them, you might
have a similar reaction.

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:43.159
I found them curious
or puzzling.

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:45.690
And more than I expected to.

00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:49.219
I thought it would
be more judicial.

00:34:49.219 --> 00:34:50.620
More television-like
or something.

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:53.130
But they really went down some
paths that were very

00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:53.445
unexpected.

00:34:53.445 --> 00:34:55.409
And their comments
were unexpected.

00:34:55.409 --> 00:34:57.490
And that was definitely
a twist.

00:34:57.490 --> 00:34:59.710
What was your response to it?

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:01.440
KRIS PERRY: I think you
covered everything.

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:02.200
SANDY STIER: I probably did.

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:03.310
KRIS PERRY: Quite an
exhaustively very

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:04.480
comprehensive answer.

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:06.950
Yes.

00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:07.455
Congratulations.

00:35:07.455 --> 00:35:08.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:14.370
KRIS PERRY: It was odd to be
there as a lesbian asking nine

00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:19.470
Supreme Court justices to
protect me from a law in the

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:23.730
state that I love, because
it was really harming me.

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:27.180
And for all of you that
listened, I hope that you

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:31.140
could feel the importance of the
moment, versus the words.

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:32.980
Because it was a moment.

00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:35.800
And the courtroom was
just electric.

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:36.780
It was packed.

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:38.290
It was shoulder to shoulder.

00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:41.200
Members of Congress, members of
White House administration,

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:45.340
public, lawyers from the Supreme
Court Bar all packed

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:47.340
in there together, anxiously
awaiting

00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:48.690
to hear these arguments.

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:49.870
And to understand.

00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:51.460
And to be a part of
a historic moment.

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:56.430
And it really was a historic
moment that I'm very, very

00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:59.480
honored to have even been
in the courtroom at all.

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.820
SANDY STIER: And there were
moments when justices said

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:03.290
things that you so
appreciated.

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:06.310
Like when Breyer said,
what about the kids?

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:07.350
I mean Kennedy.

00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:08.920
What about the kids
that are here?

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:11.780
That's the legal
analysis part.

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:13.200
We have to be a voice
for them, as well.

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.630
How do they get represented?

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:18.820
And it was heart-warming to
see that somebody thought

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:20.450
about that part, as well.

00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:21.790
Because that's one of the
things that has really

00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:24.530
compelled us to be involved in
this case is it's really not

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:26.540
just about us-- we're in pretty
good shape in our

00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:28.270
lives-- but we really
care about the

00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:29.270
generations coming up.

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:31.965
And we want that to be
acknowledged in the

00:36:31.965 --> 00:36:33.790
courtroom, as well.

00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:38.600
ALEX: OK, so this other question
was that opponents

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:43.140
often use the argument that are
based on this detrimental

00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:46.660
effects of same sex marriage
on children.

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:49.570
And the question was what you
guys thought about that?

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:52.740
And why that argument
seems to have such

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:55.050
traction or not at all?

00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:56.630
KRIS PERRY: Well, the thing
that definitely happened

00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:59.590
around Proposition 8 is they
used this idea that you should

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:03.130
be afraid of lesbian and gay
people as a campaign strategy.

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:05.230
It was part of the campaign
rhetoric.

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:06.680
And it was highly effective.

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:08.070
I don't know if you can
remember back to the

00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:11.170
Proposition 8 ads, but they
often had children in them and

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:14.600
their parents talking to them
about, it's scary now that

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:15.450
you're going to school
and you're

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:16.870
learning about these families.

00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:20.360
Or it's scary to us, as parents,
that you may end up

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:21.660
marrying someone of
the same sex.

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:24.560
So they used it very prominently
in the campaign,

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:25.800
Proposition 8.

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:28.280
And they did something
really effective.

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:32.170
They created a problem in their
campaign called, gay

00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:33.290
people are scary.

00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:35.290
And then they created a solution
called, don't let

00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:36.420
them get married.

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:39.820
And it was just effective
enough that they won.

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:43.550
Now, in court, there were
attempts made to repeat some

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:45.610
of those statements, but they
didn't hold up in the

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:47.330
courtroom because they didn't
have witnesses who could

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:49.520
support that, as
you point out.

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:53.170
So the judge was patient,
really, for them to just

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:55.160
describe what they wanted
to say about that.

00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:56.950
But was not as patient when
they couldn't produce an

00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:59.010
expert witness to support
it with data.

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:02.390
Our side, on the other hand,
had multiple witnesses that

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:06.245
had done long term studies
on a large samples.

00:38:06.245 --> 00:38:11.710
Of either adults that were
gay, or just the average

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:14.380
person, that didn't support
that at all.

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:16.410
So the reason it lives
on, I think, is a

00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:17.770
question for all of us.

00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:19.390
Where does that come from?

00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:21.950
What institution is promulgating
this believe that

00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:24.710
lesbian and gay people are
harmful for children?

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:26.350
Don't protect children?

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:28.760
There are lots of other were
negative terms that people use

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:30.040
to describe lesbian
and gay people in

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:31.040
relationship to children.

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:32.820
And it's not supported
by evidence.

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:36.660
So what we hope is that if
marriage equality starts to

00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:39.850
occur, that we'll be able to,
over time, demonstrate through

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:40.720
our actions.

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:42.020
And the way that we live.

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:44.740
And the way we parent that these
things will no longer

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:46.540
hold up, in and that those
beliefs will slowly

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:47.030
diminished.

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:51.930
But it will take a
really long time.

00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:55.530
Like I said, we probably won't
be alive when it stops being.

00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:58.420
SANDY STIER: That's
kind of a bummer.

00:38:58.420 --> 00:38:59.970
KRIS PERRY: These things
take generations,

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:01.220
unfortunately, to unwind.

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:08.080
Homophobia has been a
longstanding problem and it's

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:10.590
not going to disappear even
with a really promising

00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:12.780
ruling, unfortunately.

00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:14.280
AUDIENCE: I was in a room
many years ago, Meet in

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:15.630
the Middle in Fresno.

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:16.460
And it was like a war.

00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:17.950
Room we all had the
same outcome.

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:20.190
We wanted marriage equality,
but so many different

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:21.410
paths to get there.

00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:23.830
And nobody could really
come up with sort of a

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:25.410
common way to do it.

00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:26.660
And then this happened.

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:28.335
And it was like out
of right field.

00:39:28.335 --> 00:39:31.060
A few people have decided this
was the right course.

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:35.520
And I'm curious, using that sort
of success, and how that

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:37.990
was determined, how do we apply
that to these other

00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:38.970
problems that you're
describing?

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:41.060
That are going to continue.

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:43.690
Do we wait, as leaders,
for sort of a common

00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:44.830
decision to be made?

00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:47.630
Or do we learn from this and
just go for what we think

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:50.280
individually as a small group
is the right thing to do?

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:52.850
SANDY STIER: One of the most
important contributors to the

00:39:52.850 --> 00:39:59.340
success of this particular
strategy was really a pulling

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:00.840
together some of the best
and the brightest.

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:06.000
I mean Ted Olson, David Boies,
they are absolutely the best

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.200
and brightest among
constitutional lawyers.

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:10.370
With a great deal of experience

00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:12.390
with the Supreme Court.

00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:14.170
So that's very, very
important.

00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:18.050
And we really had the solid
initial backing of enough

00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:22.150
funders from different parts,
different political parties

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:26.080
that are across the board that
they could give it the boost

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:29.330
it needed to get
the case going.

00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:34.720
So for us, I think, it was an
unusual mix to have that

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:36.550
strength early on.

00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:39.540
And it certainly contributed
to the success.

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:41.140
I think Kris pointed out
something really important

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:43.930
earlier, which is the bipartisan
method is very,

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:45.110
very important.

00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:47.960
And Ted and David leading
our case is such a

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:48.970
great example of that.

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:51.080
They come from two very
different parties and yet,

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:54.700
they immediately took it out of
that world and said, this

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:58.240
is not about politics, this
is about equal rights.

00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:59.920
Has nothing to do
with politics.

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:02.640
And I think that was a
successful strategy, as well,

00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:04.680
because then you get more people
on board, more people

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:07.140
supporting it.

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:09.870
And I would hope that we can
address a lot of the issues

00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:11.210
that we're looking at
in a similar way.

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:13.030
Whether they're gay rights
issues or other civil rights

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:16.490
issues, like education
or health care.

00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:19.600
These are human fundamental
rights and we don't want them

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:21.570
to be partisan rights,
if at all possible.

00:41:21.570 --> 00:41:23.820
Or partisanship involved
in it.

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:26.720
KRIS PERRY: The common
denominator is leadership.

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:29.000
I honestly believe whatever
problem you're trying to

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.420
solve, you need to
be a leader.

00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:34.370
You have to take risk, you
have to be passionate and

00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:36.310
single minded about your goal.

00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:37.620
And you can't give up.

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:39.620
You cannot give up.

00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:42.280
Everybody here will come
across some bridge.

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:44.560
You have to lead other
people across it.

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:47.270
What's really interesting about
the people that stand

00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:51.510
out in this case is every single
person to a person is a

00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:52.880
leader in their own right.

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:56.010
And yet there are so many
involved in this at one time.

00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:59.570
You mentioned the example of
you're working hard to create

00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:01.610
some push-back on a political
front, because

00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:04.350
it was a voter mandate.

00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:06.800
And you're trying to figure out
how to unvote it, right?

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:09.770
Well, guess what, somebody was
a leader in another room and

00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:12.010
thought there was a different
way to move ahead and he led a

00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:13.770
group of people down
that road.

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:17.450
And that is the key ingredient
to change.

00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:18.360
Is leadership.

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:22.500
And I really can't encourage
you enough to find your

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:23.710
problem and solve it.

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:24.600
And be the leader on it.

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:28.110
And you'll end up doing
something that may not be the

00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:29.790
thing that won, but
you contributed to

00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:32.180
a win, either way.

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:35.640
AUDIENCE: Could you speak a
little as to your efforts for

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:40.160
education for younger kids?

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:40.520
KRIS PERRY: I will.

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:43.280
There's a question about
what I'm working on

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:44.670
around early education.

00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:46.920
I happen to know that you have
a really high quality early

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.310
learning center here
at Google.

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:49.650
I'd really love to
see it if anybody

00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:52.935
could run me over there.

00:42:52.935 --> 00:42:57.650
But what I've been working on in
my career for 25 years has

00:42:57.650 --> 00:42:59.620
been advocating for children.

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:01.740
Particularly children under
the age of five.

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:05.670
Because just like the marriage
equality fight and using data

00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:08.440
and evidence to prove that is
no longer acceptable to

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:11.080
exclude a group of people from
a fundamental institution.

00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:12.910
There are a group of kids in
this country who are being

00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:14.890
excluded from the education
system.

00:43:14.890 --> 00:43:17.400
And it is affecting the
trajectory of their entire

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:20.660
life, in ways that are
very, very harmful.

00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:22.780
And it's very much
based on economic

00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:24.756
factors and that is all.

00:43:24.756 --> 00:43:27.650
So what the president has done
and around marriage equality

00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:30.120
and early learning is say, in
order for our country to be

00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:32.370
strong and for us to be
together, we need to be

00:43:32.370 --> 00:43:34.250
educated, and we need to
stop discriminating

00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:35.710
against groups of people.

00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:39.110
And I feel like that is a common
theme in both efforts.

00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:43.410
Early learning is based on the
fact that most of us, almost

00:43:43.410 --> 00:43:46.150
everybody, gains 90% of their
brain weight before they turn

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:49.720
3 and the synaptic connections
that are happening are

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:51.080
happening most rapidly then.

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:52.670
And unfortunately, by
the time you turn 5,

00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:54.330
they start to prune.

00:43:54.330 --> 00:43:55.510
Your brain is pruning.

00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:57.680
So that's why we all have memory
problems later in life.

00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:01.050
You probably don't at Google,
but the rest of us do.

00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:05.490
Because the truth is, those
pathways are used later on for

00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:08.790
high level executive function,
analytical skills, that allow

00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:11.250
you to have really great
jobs like you all have.

00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:13.740
Or to work on hard issues
like we're working on.

00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:16.150
You have to have a lot of
capacity, honestly, to deal

00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:18.800
with so much that comes after
you in this world, today.

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:21.510
So early learning and, for me,
early learning and marriage

00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:24.130
equality are very similar in
the sense that they really

00:44:24.130 --> 00:44:26.280
help people reach
their potential.

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:28.300
And not be inhibited.

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:31.320
Or told that they're not going
to be successful or going to

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:32.200
be a good person.

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:34.120
And it's fun to work on both.

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:37.100
And I keep working on the other
thing because that's the

00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:37.740
job I have.

00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:42.100
Sandy is a health care
technology systems director,

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:44.670
which also, I think, really is
intended to help people have

00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:47.000
access to something
they need to be.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.880
ALEX: So maybe just to close
out as a final question.

00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:53.140
You've talked about this
a little bit already.

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:57.800
But what can people
in this room do?

00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:00.480
And now I'm going to
ask a bad question.

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:02.070
What's our obligation?

00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:05.460
So what is our obligation
either as a member of a

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:10.630
minority class or group to help
broaden inequality for

00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:14.920
other people in my group or
other minority groups?

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:17.030
Or for potential allies?

00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:20.230
What kind of obligations
do we have?

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:24.550
And how should we
execute them?

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:26.830
SANDY STIER: We should have lots
and lots of children, if

00:45:26.830 --> 00:45:27.460
at all possible.

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:31.040
Because we need the
data on parenting.

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:32.290
And do not mess your kids up.

00:45:34.822 --> 00:45:36.940
I'm not saying that we didn't
mess our kids up.

00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:38.170
We tried.

00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:38.910
ALEX: Just do your best.

00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:40.800
SANDY STIER: That's right,
do your best.

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:44.390
I think on some level, Cleve
Jones always quotes Harvey

00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:47.400
Milk in his quote that
you heard, come out,

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:48.010
come out, be honest.

00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:51.350
And I think that's really one
easy thing that we are

00:45:51.350 --> 00:45:52.120
obligated to do.

00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:53.070
Be honest.

00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:55.170
Don't hide yourself.

00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:56.810
Talk about difficult issues.

00:45:56.810 --> 00:45:59.640
Keep talking to relatives
at old school

00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:01.230
and all those people.

00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:04.850
And help them make the
switch slowly.

00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:07.340
We've really seen, with the
public opinion shifted, we've

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:08.690
seen it certainly
in the polls.

00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:10.530
We've also seen in the people
that we love and care about,

00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:12.870
our families and friends.

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:15.100
That people come to
things slowly.

00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:18.180
Like Obama came to
it slowly, right?

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:19.400
But that has to be OK.

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:22.380
You have to give people
a chance to change

00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:23.540
and be OK with it.

00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:26.500
And not hold it against
them too much that

00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:27.420
it took a long time.

00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:29.010
Or that's its happening
slowly.

00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:33.800
But I think supporting change
is the best way to model the

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:36.290
future that we want to have
for our own kids.

00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:38.360
We want them to feel comfortable
coming out, then

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:40.060
be comfortable being out.

00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:40.810
Right?

00:46:40.810 --> 00:46:45.300
And if we can do that that's
something everybody can do.

00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:46.440
KRIS PERRY: I think you
live with a lot of

00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:48.910
integrity and passion.

00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:50.400
And be a model.

00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:52.900
Model what you think we
should all be doing,

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:53.990
wherever you are.

00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:55.890
And it can be on a very small,

00:46:55.890 --> 00:46:57.740
one-on-one basis with somebody.

00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:00.950
It does not have to be on the
scale of the United States

00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:01.920
Supreme Court.

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:04.180
I think it's actually the
smaller interactions that

00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:06.180
happened between individuals
at work.

00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:09.500
One-on-one at a family
reunion.

00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:11.910
At a class reunion.

00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:13.950
Even at the doctor's office
when you have to tell them

00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:15.960
their form's wrong.

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:19.160
Those interactions actually
do change the world.

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:23.170
They add up to something that's
cumulatively powerful.

00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:26.500
And on behalf of Sandy and I
want to thank you for letting

00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:29.180
us tell you about our
contribution to this gigantic

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:31.180
effort that we're all
really engaged in.

00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:33.240
You wouldn't be here if you
didn't care a lot about it and

00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:34.700
you were out there advocating
yourself.

00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:35.910
I'm sure you are.

00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:39.720
And we need all of our voices
singing in unison on this

00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:42.580
issue of fairness and equality
because the more diverse and

00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:44.760
inclusive we are, the
stronger we are.

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:47.170
So thank you for
having us here.

00:47:47.170 --> 00:47:50.310
ALEX: And we just want to thank
you so much for your

00:47:50.310 --> 00:47:51.390
leadership over the years.

00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:55.320
I mean this takes a toll and
personally, time-wise,

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:57.370
financially, all of that.

00:47:57.370 --> 00:48:01.000
And civil rights movement, as
you said, are just built over

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.590
generations, over decades, and
everyone adds a little bit.

00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:08.500
And you guys have clearly added
a huge block to it.

00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:12.380
And so, hopefully, we'll all
kind of take that and continue

00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:13.520
to move forward with you guys.

00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:18.190
And also I think you guys are
clearly very articulate and

00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:18.980
inspirational.

00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:22.510
So I think the other thing that
you guys have brought is

00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:25.510
probably just inspiring
thousands of others to

00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:29.770
advocate for whatever equality
that they feel is important,

00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:30.400
