00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.720
One of the most important concepts in modern economics is the idea of demand.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.920
A functioning economy has to have a healthy level of demand in it

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.880
for lack of demand invariably leads to the most awful specter of all: recession.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:22.080
Therefore, governments carefully track how much demand there is and are careful to apply a stimulus

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.960
whenever it looks as if there isn't any.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.380
This involves maneuvers like lowering interest rates, cutting taxes, and loosening credit in all manner of ways.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.620
For example, in a typical piece of demand stimulus in December 2008, fearing a recession,

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.060
the Australian government gave a present of $1,000 to every family in the country,

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:48.500
encouraging them to go out and spend so as to avoid economic disaster.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.440
Currently, the focus of economics is entirely on the quantity of demand,

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.740
on trying to get people to spend more money on, well, pretty much anything.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:04.780
It's not what we spend money on interest economists it's that they spend it on something.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.800
Very little attention has, so far, ever been devoted to the issue of the quality of demand.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.200
It's considered entirely irrelevant, by economists and governments, what people are spending on.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.400
They might be buying donuts, or taking French conversation classes,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.220
seeing a psychotherapist, or purchasing a sports car.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.360
In terms of GDP, unemployment, and stock market

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.880
it doesn't matter in the least what they're buying so long as the total spend is high enough.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.800
The only caveat is that it is a headache for the state if too much expenditure goes to overseas businesses.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.380
Yet, clearly in other ways it does matter what we spend our money on because

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.600
the combined purchasing choices of millions of people shapes the kind of society we live in

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.860
and the kinds of lives most of us end up leading.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.380
If everyone wants game shows on TV, and doughnuts with marzipan coating for supper,

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.360
a lot of us will end up working in those industries.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.380
If on the other hand there is little demand poetry, or couples therapy,

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.400
or ritualized tea drinking by moonlight in straw and wooden huts (it was big in 16th century Japan),

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:15.000
few people can end up working in these areas and if they do they won't earn much.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.860
This is where a major statement of value judgment comes in: there is better and worse demand.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.700
Demand for handguns is, we can say with assurance, less good than demand for education.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.800
Demand for healthy food is better than demand for junk food.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.800
Our societies should feel less nervous about treading into the area of values.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.120
After all, in our own lives we know there are better and worse things to spend money on,

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.940
and that's not different at a macroscale.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.620
Good demand is defined as a consumer choice that's in line with fruitful needs.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.380
It properly pays off.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.980
It contributes to better lives in the long term.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.220
There wouldn't be a single set of purchases right for everyone, but that's not the point.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.760
The issue is merely to get the debate started and to draw attention to the fact that there are better and worse purchasing decisions

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.800
and that a society needs to discuss what these might be instead of just focusing on demand, per say.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:20.020
Raising the quality of demand doesn't imply a draconian government imposing some supposedly high-minded

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.840
agenda on a reluctant public.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.480
Demand, in a market oriented democratic society, is and can only ever be voluntary.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.840
Raising demand can't be a matter of forcing anyone to do anything.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:42.220
But what we need is the more important, more humane task of encouraging ourselves to be wiser in our purchasing decisions.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.180
A phenomenon we don't pay enough attention to is: the education of the consumer.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.960
Poor choices are not innate, unmovable characteristics.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.500
They're simply what happens when you don't have the chance to learn.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.640
With the right engaging guides we can overhaul our ideas of what we want in many areas.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:08.920
We've done it to a great extent already around food, but travel, furniture, housing design, education, psychotherapy,

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.900
and relationships all stand in need a little help.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.860
If good demand were more normal it would transform society.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.640
There'd be fewer jobs that felt demeaning or degrading

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.560
because more demand would be directed towards more meaningful needs.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.220
Profit wouldn't look sinister or suspect, it would be a sign that a company was doing the right thing and doing it rather brilliantly.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.160
it would be a sign that a company was doing the right thing and doing it rather brilliantly.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.120
We've been too ready to accept that what people want is some kind of immovable force.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.380
In fact, it's entirely subject to change.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:46.580
It's simply a pity that the only people who actively seek to change what people want are corporations,

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.560
with very large advertising budgets and often rather doubtful things to sell us.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:58.920
It's time for philosophers and others to engage in a complex ethical task of influencing public wants.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:05.600
We need to take up the task of creating better demand.
