little steps in between and each of

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300
little steps in between and each of
 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.479

those steps is an opportunity to fail
 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.539
those steps is an opportunity to fail
and they're very much outcome focused

is showing us that we do much better

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610
is showing us that we do much better
 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.140
is showing us that we do much better
when we focus on incremental change on

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150
when we focus on incremental change on
 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.899
when we focus on incremental change on
little bits of improvement we're not

little bits of improvement we're not
 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:11.760
little bits of improvement we're not
focused on the outcome so we're not

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770
focused on the outcome so we're not
 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.820

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120
you know big New Year's resolution
 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.430
you know big New Year's resolution
you're just focused on the process in

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440
you're just focused on the process in
 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.940
you're just focused on the process in
this next moment that's coming up and

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950
this next moment that's coming up and
 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.700
this next moment that's coming up and
that allows you to grow a little bit

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710
that allows you to grow a little bit
 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.220
that allows you to grow a little bit
over time to not think of each of these

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230
over time to not think of each of these
 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.000
over time to not think of each of these
steps as an opportunity to fail and

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010
steps as an opportunity to fail and
 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.120
steps as an opportunity to fail and
eventually you know in aggregate you get

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130
eventually you know in aggregate you get
 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.640
eventually you know in aggregate you get
there you may not even realize it until

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650
there you may not even realize it until
 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.190
there you may not even realize it until
one day you turn around and say wow this

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200
one day you turn around and say wow this
 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.320
one day you turn around and say wow this
thing is much easier for me now than it

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330
thing is much easier for me now than it
 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.230

was a year ago I think Carol Dweck's

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240
was a year ago I think Carol Dweck's

work on growth versus fixed mindsets to

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570
work on growth versus fixed mindsets to
 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.500
work on growth versus fixed mindsets to
me that's the most important work around

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510
me that's the most important work around
 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.630
me that's the most important work around
this idea of self nudging Carol Dweck's

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640
this idea of self nudging Carol Dweck's
 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.590
this idea of self nudging Carol Dweck's
idea is that when you have kids focus on

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600
idea is that when you have kids focus on
 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.340

school tasks not as opportunities to win

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350
school tasks not as opportunities to win
 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.789
school tasks not as opportunities to win
or fail but as you know challenges that

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:08.799
or fail but as you know challenges that
 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:11.030
or fail but as you know challenges that
will allow them to stretch and grow

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040
will allow them to stretch and grow
 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.280
will allow them to stretch and grow
that's a growth mindset they do much

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290
that's a growth mindset they do much
 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.670
that's a growth mindset they do much
better you build children who are

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680
better you build children who are
 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.399
better you build children who are
resilient and you know and strong and

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409
resilient and you know and strong and
 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:23.150

failure or you know a win so they're
 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.150
failure or you know a win so they're
very outcome focused you're not building
