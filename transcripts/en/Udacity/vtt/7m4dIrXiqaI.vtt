00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.381
So this wasn’t a super trivial question. This

00:00:03.381 --> 00:00:05.198
is actually a really good question. Why

00:00:05.198 --> 00:00:08.116
can’t you open the windows on a plane? And

00:00:08.116 --> 00:00:10.349
now you know the answer. Congratulations!

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.208
Maybe now you can go on to the forums and

00:00:12.208 --> 00:00:14.256
hypothesize about another seemingly

00:00:14.256 --> 00:00:17.336
easy question. How does the straw work?

00:00:17.336 --> 00:00:19.000
See you on the forum.
