00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
 With the advent of refrigerators, we can 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.360
 Preserve our foods for a longer period than ever before. 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.460
 But is there a difference between fresh and frozen foods? 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.300
 What should we address? 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.000
 You may shout "Of course fresh food is better, it's fresh". By instinct. 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.040
 May be right. But that depends heavily on the circumstances. 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.560
 In many cases, the food you take may be from the shelf in the shop 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.320
 It was harvested before reaching maturity to avoid damage during travel. 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.040
 This means that it has not yet reached its food peak. 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.260
 Furthermore, food content begins to deteriorate in the minute in which food is collected, 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.900
 Then the food is loaded onto a truck, boat or plane, traveling for several days and then waiting on the shelf for you to choose. 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.980
 After that, these foods may remain in your refrigerator for a few more days before they are eaten. 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.600
 During this period of up to weeks, foods may lose up to 50% of their nutritional value. 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.280
 On the other hand frozen foods are selected when they are ripe and frozen immediately. 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.600
 While rapid freezing affects the content of vitamins, 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.840
 They basically freeze or lock most nutrients in place. 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.640
 In addition to fresh products that have remained for weeks, 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.300
 There is no doubt that frozen foods can contain a greater nutritional value, 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.780
 Especially during the month, which is not a season for local products are transported from long distances. 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.920
 In a series of studies, after 3 days of storage, frozen broccoli had the highest or highest level of vitamin C and beta-carotene. 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.000
 While frozen berries were much higher in containing polyphenols and anthocyanins, 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.600
 Frozen buds recorded the highest percentage in all dietary measures. 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.900
 Of course if you pick fresh vegetables from your garden or get them from the local farmers market, 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.900
 The same day, it can not be compared to frozen foods in terms of nutritional value and taste. 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:38.000
 But if you are not able to shop every few days, frozen products are a great alternative to you. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.300
 Did you like our own whiteboard, looking to free your creative side?

 Which we now use with pride. 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.620
 Write down the funniest when they attack you, or just make random drawings or scribbles on your desk. 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.000
 If you have watched our video about sitting, you know how important it is to stand from time to time. 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.260
 These things are really fantastic, they offer our viewers a $ 50 discount on any size and model for the iPad.
