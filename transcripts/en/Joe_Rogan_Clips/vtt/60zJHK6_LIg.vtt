1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.520
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.690
Shitting yourself is probably the most embarrassing thing a person can do,
right?

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.570
Yeah.
You share yourself.

4
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.080
A guy who's known for being handsome and Debonair and a bad ass can't make it to

5
00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:14.430
the toilet and type black.

6
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.780
There's no control over and shoot yourself in your car while you're driving.

7
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.040
You know,
white leather seats.

8
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.540
That's the worst it's going to happen to something happens.

9
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.400
Everybody is going to be a time in your life if you eat risky.
Yeah.
Right?

10
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.490
Yeah.
Think of the most handsome person in the world.

11
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.670
Most beautiful woman in the world splattering all over herself at some point and

12
00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:41.670
her hotness day,
most likely.
Do you remember that?

13
00:00:41.671 --> 00:00:44.070
I don't like thinking about that.
What was the Woody Harrelson movie?

14
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.310
Was it w?
W what does it that was,
he was throwing up.
Was there,

15
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.260
was it
woody Harrelson movie where he played the Bowler?
Oh yeah,

16
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.820
I'll,
I'll a kingpin ting pen.
Yeah.
That was a scene,
right?

17
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.950
There wasn't a shit seat in that.
That was,

18
00:01:01.951 --> 00:01:04.320
I'm thinking of dumb and dumber is a shit.
Seen it.
Well,

19
00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:07.650
he's shitting in the urinal.
That's about it.
Really?
Oh yeah,
that's right.

20
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.890
That's right.
I know how to do it.
Is that a fairly brothers movie?

21
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.380
Dumb and dumber eyes.
Big Shit seem too with the Jeff Daniels.
That's right.

22
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.420
That's what I'm thinking.
It's laxative in his,

23
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.730
where he's hanging onto the toilet lid.
Look,

24
00:01:20.731 --> 00:01:24.300
he's going to get shocked to orbit and he's going,
oh yeah.

25
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.720
They got all this weird noises.
Yeah.
Because Jim Carrey was tilt cylinders girl.

26
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.900
Yeah.
Yeah.
Poisoned.
Poisoned his friend.
Yeah,
that's it right there.

27
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.880
There it is full on.
But kingpin would the,

28
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.220
was it a fairly brothers mover?
That's,
um,

29
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.150
that's one of my all time favorite comedy movies.
Pain,
pain.
That's a great guy.

30
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.840
I remember loving it,
but I haven't seen it in so long.
I need to get a look out.

31
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:46.501
Look that.
And again,

32
00:01:46.501 --> 00:01:51.501
I'm scared to watch movies that I love again and see him in the light of 2019

33
00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:55.200
and go [inaudible] yeah,
this is terrible.
Yeah.

34
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.710
I know that's happened a couple of times happens.
It's weird,
right?
Yeah.

35
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.870
You remembered so fondly.
Yeah.
Look at that.
Bilberry think that hair,

36
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.380
that hair is amazing.

37
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.700
He said was such a good movie,

38
00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:12.900
but like so hair and makeup had to go like,
I'm sure that was his decision.

39
00:02:12.901 --> 00:02:16.800
We're going to make your hair just fan out randomly.
God was,

40
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.500
it's going to look like a spoiler on a Fiero before Donald Trump.
Yeah.
Yeah.

41
00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.880
Like a little Trump thing going on there.
It's very similar.

42
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.570
So as a professional bowler now,

43
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.170
the PBA that has a full on orange Afro right now really?

44
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.790
And he's like really good and he's from my hometown.
Yeah.
See if you're a bowl,

45
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.040
you got to do something like that.

46
00:02:35.041 --> 00:02:39.750
Stand out where like purple glittery clothes or some shit.
That's smart.

47
00:02:39.751 --> 00:02:40.501
That's just Brandon.

48
00:02:40.501 --> 00:02:44.880
He's peacock and he's like there is that dude's from Hickory,
North Carolina.

49
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.340
See that's why he wears that shit.

50
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.290
Got Him while he's just got to too.
I mean,

51
00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:56.260
how the fuck else do you get attention when you're a bowler?
So exactly right.

52
00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.140
Like that might be the only way to save bowling.

53
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.330
They might have to let go like roller derby and just knock into each other.

54
00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:04.870
What a yeah.
Or board a bowling man.

55
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.160
I've never sat down and watched bowling.
Ari's got a good friend,

56
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.900
Tommy,
what's his name?
He's a professional bowler.

57
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.360
Real Nice Guy.
I met him at a couple of shows.
Okay.

58
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.260
But this guy's a real pro bowler and we were talking about like the financial

59
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:23.140
opportunities of bowling and this is not good.

60
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.880
Like pro pool player.
The way on both surprised.
It sucks.

61
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.190
It sucks that deck.
Tommy

62
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.850
[inaudible] friend.
I'm sorry.
This heavy boldly.
Recently I bought with my kids.

63
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.630
Yeah.
I five bold.
Yeah.
Dilutes maybe.
I think that's it.
Yeah.
Tommy glutes.

64
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.180
I think that's it.
[inaudible] go with was a,
Yup.

65
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.190
That's him did turn it around 1%.
There's already went to see him bowl.
Yeah.

66
00:03:54.191 --> 00:03:58.390
He's a good guy.
Good guy.
Real fucking killer blower.
Do you,

67
00:03:58.391 --> 00:04:01.730
can you make it curve?
No.
Yeah.
Even try steam roll.

68
00:04:01.731 --> 00:04:03.880
That motherfucker do to ride down the damn metal.

69
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.940
I do it as hard as humanly possible or it's just disturbing for people to watch

70
00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:10.510
and now they have at the,

71
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.900
they have to miles per hour up there so you can see how fast it's like a dam,

72
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.110
you know,
like a pitching thing.
I'm trying to get that bitch fast.

73
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.110
I just want to smash those things.

74
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.170
I get annoyed at the guys who like curve it really good.

75
00:04:23.171 --> 00:04:27.940
Like he goes way over here and it just whips real fast and then a gutter ball.

76
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.850
Oh.
I'm like,
oh that for for fucking both to fucked up.
Look at all that you did.

77
00:04:32.851 --> 00:04:36.160
You have shitty whip watch now watch me ride down the middle.

78
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.200
Struck to me bowling was always like breaking in Pool.
It's like,

79
00:04:41.201 --> 00:04:45.280
yeah,
it's cool to break the balls,
but the real cool thing is to play the game.

80
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.160
Like this is you just breaking the balls over and over again.

81
00:04:48.161 --> 00:04:52.930
It's the same look every time you in,
well it's like bowling,

82
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.810
bowling,
you're just breaking the balls.
That's all you're doing.

83
00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.980
Like when you're bowling,

84
00:04:56.981 --> 00:04:59.680
you got pins just knocking down the pins and the exact same order.

85
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.050
It's the same thing every time.

86
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.710
And I know the combinations are different in the way they collide and the where

87
00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:10.600
you impact is different,
but it's still the same thing.
It's a dumb game.

88
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.940
I'm sorry.
And my grandfather was a big bowler man,

89
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.430
bold leagues and he had trophies in his house and Shit.
He used to love bowling,

90
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:19.840
but I was like a little kid.

91
00:05:19.841 --> 00:05:22.900
I was analyzing bowling cause he'd take me bowling with them.
I was like,

92
00:05:22.901 --> 00:05:24.910
this isn't a nonsense game.
Yeah.
Scams,

93
00:05:24.911 --> 00:05:29.770
nonsense like you to get into it just so you can smoke and drink and is a thing

94
00:05:29.771 --> 00:05:34.240
that they have in the east coast in Boston that they don't even have anywhere

95
00:05:34.241 --> 00:05:37.930
else.
It's called candle pin bowling.
He ever see that shit.

96
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.950
It's which smaller version,
dude?
Dude,
you ball with a softball.

97
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:47.110
That sounds more fun to me.
But it's huge in the east coast.
Hometown,
Ohio.

98
00:05:47.111 --> 00:05:50.380
They've got a few places actually with gigantic bars that they have all these

99
00:05:50.381 --> 00:05:52.510
lanes for this thing.
Yeah.
For candle pin bowling.
Yeah.

100
00:05:52.511 --> 00:05:53.930
It's called pens or something.
Yeah.

101
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.400
I was looking down on that because I came from grandfather in New Jersey.

102
00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.970
I bold regular bowling,
like a fucking American.
Right.
And then I over,

103
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:04.700
what's this candle pit bull shit.
What'd you guys steal this from?

104
00:06:04.701 --> 00:06:08.550
Finland or something?
What is that nonsense like pins.

105
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.410
Oh mock.
Now see I didn't notice that.
That is ridiculous.
No,

106
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.860
they are shaped that way.
Thrown rocks to thrown rocks at pins.

107
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:18.380
That's not what I was talking about.
This is really just a bar.
What is that hard?

108
00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.870
This is not what you're talking about.
Well,
I mean it is,
but it's,

109
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.630
it's way smaller and it's really just like a bar game.
Oh No,

110
00:06:23.631 --> 00:06:25.880
this I have like five lanes or 10 lands and he could play,

111
00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.950
but it's this same game.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Should have been bowling in New England.

112
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.910
They'll have like bowling alleys and you all let's go bowl and they're like,
Oh,

113
00:06:34.911 --> 00:06:36.920
we're candle pin only people like what?

114
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.150
Candle pin only bowling alleys.
Yeah.

115
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.960
So we're going to light these candles.
That's what I want it set them on fire.

116
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.090
It only works on the east coast for some reason.

117
00:06:47.091 --> 00:06:51.230
There's like a few of those things,
like,
how about this?
Hi Lie.
Oh fuck.

118
00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.720
People can find out.
Is that logo that fought?
That ball goes fast.
Right?

119
00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:57.000
It's nice.
Actually.
It's way smaller.
And I was thinking in my head,
I'm like,
oh,

120
00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.380
no one's different.
Miniature bowling kind of.
Yeah.
Okay.

121
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.670
The ball to keep ball a little bit.
Yeah.
So it's kind of like candle pin bowling,

122
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.730
but the candle pins,
the pins are different.
The shape,
like candles,

123
00:07:07.731 --> 00:07:09.710
that's why it's called candle pin bowling.
If you look at them,

124
00:07:09.711 --> 00:07:13.750
they're thin pins are not,
they're not like fat on the bottom.
That's like what?

125
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.190
Why are we even here?
Yeah.
