00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.210
There's nothing movie fans love more a twist
you never see coming, and usually, the more

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.160
surprising a story, the better it is. But
even eagle-eyed fans paying attention to the

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.680
smallest detail can be surprised at just how
many hints, clues, or prophetic statements

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.410
that passed them by. These hints will definitely
&nbsp;have you re-watching some of your favorite

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.119
films - even if you can't believe you didn't
catch on the first time around. Be warned:

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.599
there are plenty of spoilers ahead in Screen
Rant's 10 Amazing Clues You Missed In Movies.

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:32.739
Skyfall (MGM/Columbia Pictures)

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.239
It's usually hard to find any meaning in the
opening credits of a James Bond adventure,

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.200
since they're famous for being more abstract
and stylish than most of the movies that follow.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.730
But Skyfall planted one major hint in its
title sequence. The movie became famous for

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.030
its sombre tone, including an ending that
saw Judi Dench's "M" killed in action and

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.410
replaced by Ralph. It shocked audiences, but
not the people paying close attention at the

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.460
start, with the actress's name displayed over
a headstone.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.020
Interstellar (Paramount/Warner Bros.)

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.980
The film's physics-defying, brain-bending
ending might have turned off some audiences,

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.890
but even if Interstellar's ending was confusing,
it was a shocking twist. After a former astronaut

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.280
and his daughter are drawn to a secret NASA
base by a mysterious "ghost," he winds up

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.979
saving mankind, using a black hole and some
gravity to actually *become* the ghost that

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.119
sent him on the mission in the first place.
It was a truly impossible time loop to predict...

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:28.770
until you remember the very first line of
dialogue in the entire movie.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.770
The Matrix (Warner Bros.)

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.479
Every fan of The Matrix remembers the first
time seeing Neo interrogated by unknown agents,

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.420
long before they realized just what the Matrix
or the programs were. For the rest of the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.770
movie, Agent Smith seems determined to prove
that the former hacker isn't really The One,

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.740
the man who will lead humanity to victory
against the Machines. But he did have a warning.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.189
Take a closer look at the green folder holding
Neo's "file," and right below the "SECRET"

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.790
stamp, you'll notice the number one circled.
That's why you always read the fine print.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.590
Transformers Dark of the Moon (Paramount)

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.560
When Optimus Prime and his Autobots discover
that a fellow Transformer crash landed on

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.390
the moon in the 1960s, they discover that
the stranded Autobot is Sentinel Prime, the

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.930
leader who Optimus replaced. The hero is voiced
by actor Leonard Nimoy, best known as "Mr.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.470
Spock" from the original Star Trek. But the
twist comes when Sentinel betrays them, siding

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.080
with the Decepticons to bring their home planet
to Earth and destroy humanity. Seeing Spock

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.360
turn pure evil and try to take over the world
only got him and Megatron killed. But if viewers

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.910
wanted to save themselves some time, they
could've just taken Wheelie's advice in the

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.239
first few minutes.

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:34.560
The Dark Knight Rises (Warner Bros.)

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.420
We've already explained one reason audiences
should've predicted the twist of Christopher

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.269
Nolan's third Batman movie, but fans only
had to keep their eyes on the fire, and the

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.660
twist was practically obvious. For starters,
fire is used all the time by Bane and his

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:55.010
followers, just like Ra's al Ghul in Batman
Begins. It proved that the villains shared

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.620
the same mission, but there were even more
hints that Miranda Tate was really the villain's

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.879
daughter Talia. No fan will forget the final
question Ra's asked Bruce before his death:

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:07.340
"have you finally learned to do what is necessary?",
so they should have caught Miranda using the

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.800
same phrase. Ra's even described the League's
job as restoring the balance to the world

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.640
- years later, that was exactly what Miranda
Tate claimed she was after the first time

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.840
she spoke with Bruce. Finally, her thoughts
on fire should have made things completely

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.920
obvious.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:29.920
Inception (Warner Bros.)

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.599
There's no shortage of theories surrounding
the ending of this dream-stealing drama, but

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.700
forget asking if Cobb's top stopped spinning
in the final shot - what if the entire movie

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.920
was one of his dreams?

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.280
Start with the first rule of dreams Cobb explains?.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.730
The movie begins that exact same way, starting
at the end, then jumping to the beginning

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.019
in the middle of another job. We later learn
that a dreaming mind clings to certain numbers.

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:58.260
Soon after, the train that took Cobb and his
wife out of limbo shows up marked 3502. The

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.030
team's taxi is marked 2053, and Cobb's wife
apparently committed suicide in room 3502

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.590
as well. To top it off, Saito dreams of living
in a house built on a cliff not once, but

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.099
twice. The dream should only be his, but when
Cobb is reunited with his kids, pay close

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:19.239
attention to their words, not the spinning
top.

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:20.239
Avatar (20th Century Fox)

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.220
James Cameron's 3D epic is about as science
fiction and fantasy as blockbusters can get

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.860
- but the characters also can't seem to offer
clues about what will happen to them by the

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.770
end of the movie. When Sigourney Weaver's
scientist explains that outsiders aren't allowed

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.889
to get close to the planet's Tree of Souls,
she says she'd be willing to give up her life

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:48.759
to know how it works. 
The wish comes true not long after, leaving

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:52.220
her mortally wounded. When she's taken to
the Tree for a last ditch effort to save her

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:59.199
life, she and the audience realize she got
her wish after all.

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:00.199
Star Wars (Lucasfilm/Disney)

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:05.090
As classic and timeless a story of "good vs
evil" as Star Wars is, the films really only

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.380
offer one side of the story. The ancient Jedi
prophecy of The Chosen One who would destroy

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:17.860
the Sith, for instance, was coming from the
Sith's greatest enemies. In Episode I, the

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:25.520
actual prophecy only said that the Chosen
One would only "bring balance to the Force".

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.380
And any fan of history and fantasy knows that
prophecies aren't usually exactly as they

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.759
seem. If viewers took a second to ask what
"balance" actually meant, then Anakin's story

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:37.419
is tragic - but exactly what was promised.
He did terrible things, but did technically

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:42.139
"balance the force," leaving two Jedi to serve
the light side, and two Sith lords to serve

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:45.620
the Dark. It only seems fair.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.539
Star Trek Into Darkness (Paramount)

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:51.500
Fans of classic Star Trek can still debate
the secrecy surrounding the updated version

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.949
of Khan for this Star Trek sequel, but the
most staggering reveal for casual audiences

00:05:55.949 --> 00:06:00.940
was the Vengeance, a massive attack ship that
made the USS Enterprise look like a toy. But

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.169
the secret was spoiled in the first act. Admiral
Marcus may have kept the ship's construction

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:09.220
under wraps, but the long line of spaceship
models in his office includes every iconic

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:14.289
ship from the Trek TV show and films - finally
landing on the Vengeance, clearly the villain's

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:17.759
favorite, going by his loving stare. Can you
even call it a reveal when it's shoved in

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:21.139
the audience's face?

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:22.569
The Matrix Reloaded (Warner Bros.)

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:26.639
Becoming The One is a short victory, since
The Matrix Reloaded delivered its own twist

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:30.850
ending. When Neo finally finished his quest
and met the Architect, he learned he wasn't

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:35.560
the savior of mankind, just one in a long
line, all doomed to repeat the same cycle

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.470
of Man/Machine war. It sent fans reeling,
but probably shouldn't have, since it was

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:47.880
explicitly stated by the Merovingian a full
45 minutes earlier in the movie. The storm

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.610
of bullets made it hard to grasp what was
just revealed, but even Neo didn't catch it,

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:52.630
so don't feel too bad.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:57.030
Those are the coolest clues, hints, or teases
we could find in our favorite films, but which

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:58.030
ones did we miss?
