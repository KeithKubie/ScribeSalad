&gt;&gt;Steve Chabon: Here at the College
Preparatory School in Oakland,

00:00:15.076 --> 00:00:17.356
California, collaborative
learning is one

00:00:17.356 --> 00:00:19.826
of the most important ways
our students learn and grow.

00:00:20.276 --> 00:00:22.206
&gt;&gt;Harrison: In math we
work in groups every day,

00:00:22.316 --> 00:00:24.806
asking each other questions
before we ask the teacher.

00:00:25.186 --> 00:00:28.606
&gt;&gt;Maya: In English, we lead
our own round table discussions

00:00:28.606 --> 00:00:31.086
to deepen our understanding
of the books we read.

00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:33.506
&gt;&gt;David Markus: College Prep is one
of the top private high schools

00:00:33.506 --> 00:00:36.566
in the country and a terrific
model for collaborative learning.

00:00:36.886 --> 00:00:40.256
The good news, their practices are
both replicable and affordable.

00:00:40.736 --> 00:00:42.426
Take a look at what they
do for their students.

00:00:42.586 --> 00:00:45.706
It may change what you
decide to do for yours.

00:01:03.656 --> 00:01:06.296
&gt;&gt;Monique DeVane: College Prep School
is a fifty-two-year-old school.

00:01:06.296 --> 00:01:11.896
It was founded by two women who
had a strong vision of a place

00:01:11.896 --> 00:01:13.476
where academics could really thrive.

00:01:14.026 --> 00:01:16.476
&gt;&gt;The collaborative
teaching and learning

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:19.316
that we do here is
really distinctive.

00:01:19.526 --> 00:01:22.806
Individual work can be a
great way to master content,

00:01:23.086 --> 00:01:25.396
but what the group
work empowers and kind of

00:01:25.396 --> 00:01:29.606
enables is a student's
cultivation of a certain resilience.

00:01:29.606 --> 00:01:31.806
How do you look to your
neighbor as a resource,

00:01:32.116 --> 00:01:35.426
how do you test your own theories,
how do you understand if you're

00:01:35.426 --> 00:01:37.076
on the right track
or the wrong track?

00:01:37.356 --> 00:01:38.486
The sort of habits of mind

00:01:38.486 --> 00:01:41.016
that actually are the
underpinnings of deeper scholarship.

00:01:41.736 --> 00:01:43.406
&gt;&gt;Betsy Thomas: We have forty-five-
minute classes

00:01:43.406 --> 00:01:45.206
and the math classes meet every day.

00:01:45.536 --> 00:01:47.856
The kids come in and
they go over the homework

00:01:47.856 --> 00:01:49.676
in their groups by comparing answers.

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:52.776
&gt;&gt;Boy: I got the square root
of B squared plus A squared.

00:01:52.866 --> 00:01:56.216
&gt;&gt;Betsy: And then if
they're having no resolution,

00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:59.586
like a problem was too hard for
everybody, that's the signal that says

00:01:59.586 --> 00:02:01.766
that we need to talk about
a problem or two as a class.

00:02:02.586 --> 00:02:05.486
&gt;&gt;Aidan: The thing I like most about
the group work is how easy it is

00:02:05.486 --> 00:02:06.836
to get help if you're
stuck on a problem.

00:02:06.836 --> 00:02:08.826
I mean, you can just ask one
of your group-mates to help you

00:02:08.826 --> 00:02:11.216
and everybody's really
ready to lend a hand.

00:02:11.276 --> 00:02:12.956
&gt;&gt;Boy: That's these two lines

00:02:12.956 --> 00:02:18.016
and then we do the slope
formula from zero to there.

00:02:18.016 --> 00:02:20.336
&gt;&gt;Betsy: All right, here
comes classwork, thirty.

00:02:20.896 --> 00:02:23.526
The ones I care most
about are one and two.

00:02:23.526 --> 00:02:26.406
&gt;&gt;Girl: And then it says, draw
the segment from AB to CD,

00:02:26.486 --> 00:02:28.986
so we just connect those points.

00:02:29.196 --> 00:02:34.066
&gt;&gt;Betsy: We designed the
classwork problems to be harder

00:02:34.066 --> 00:02:34.906
than the homework problems.

00:02:34.906 --> 00:02:37.226
The homework problems tend
to be more straightforward

00:02:37.226 --> 00:02:39.996
and the classwork problems
are much meatier.

00:02:39.996 --> 00:02:43.566
And so in order for them to
actually accomplish them,

00:02:43.826 --> 00:02:45.166
they have to talk to each other.

00:02:45.536 --> 00:02:48.326
&gt;&gt;Ethan: For harder problems,
usually our group will work together

00:02:48.906 --> 00:02:52.966
and we can usually come to
a solution, just by putting

00:02:52.966 --> 00:02:54.426
like little pieces of it together.

00:02:54.426 --> 00:02:56.736
&gt;&gt;I got negative B
over C for one and two.

00:02:56.736 --> 00:02:58.436
&gt;&gt;I don't think it's negative
B over C because it's--

00:02:58.436 --> 00:02:59.226
&gt;&gt;Yeah, but there's this--

00:02:59.366 --> 00:03:01.286
&gt;&gt;Betsy: The best groups talk

00:03:01.286 --> 00:03:03.716
about the problems before
they take pencil to paper.

00:03:03.746 --> 00:03:06.826
You really tell, their faces
are directed towards each other.

00:03:07.336 --> 00:03:10.036
They are, you know, looking
at each other's papers,

00:03:10.496 --> 00:03:12.386
and they're learning so much more.

00:03:12.386 --> 00:03:15.606
They're learning how to be
proactive, they're learning how

00:03:15.606 --> 00:03:21.026
to depend on their peers.

00:03:21.446 --> 00:03:23.336
&gt;&gt;Girl: Today you will work
as a team of surveyors,

00:03:23.516 --> 00:03:25.376
putting to use your
knowledge of basic compass

00:03:25.416 --> 00:03:26.556
and straight edge constructions.

00:03:26.736 --> 00:03:28.936
Your only tools will be a length
of rope and a piece of chalk.

00:03:29.346 --> 00:03:31.776
&gt;&gt;Ethan: I feel like when
we work outside together,

00:03:31.776 --> 00:03:34.236
it just kind of brings our group
together a little bit more.

00:03:35.896 --> 00:03:37.526
&gt;&gt;Aidan: You needed someone
to hold the rope and someone

00:03:37.526 --> 00:03:40.336
to move the chalk, and so it
was just like the next step

00:03:40.496 --> 00:03:44.356
in collaboration was working
together to make one big end result.

00:03:44.656 --> 00:03:53.626
&gt;&gt;Julie Anderson: What I do in my classroom
is I try to make the kids feel

00:03:53.626 --> 00:03:56.166
as comfortable and as safe
to be able to take the risks

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.906
that will create a good conversation.

00:03:57.906 --> 00:04:00.206
On the first day of class
with the ninth grade,

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:04.026
I start by asking the students, "What
are the values implicit in sitting

00:04:04.026 --> 00:04:07.616
around this large,
wooden, oval table?"

00:04:08.066 --> 00:04:10.076
And they come up with
a list on their own.

00:04:10.076 --> 00:04:13.416
First and foremost is
respect, and also listening

00:04:13.416 --> 00:04:15.596
to each other, being courteous.

00:04:16.546 --> 00:04:19.846
Having the right geography of the
classroom, it's really important.

00:04:20.096 --> 00:04:23.416
I always make sure before we start
class, "Can you all see each other?

00:04:23.416 --> 00:04:25.386
Can you make eye contact
with your classmates?"

00:04:25.386 --> 00:04:28.786
And if you can't, I have them adjust
their chairs so that they can.

00:04:29.576 --> 00:04:31.986
I always tell the kids,
"Check your ego at the door.

00:04:32.376 --> 00:04:35.796
Be willing to take risks and just
have fun and just throw out idea.

00:04:35.796 --> 00:04:38.946
And you throw something else
out and it's not fully formed,

00:04:38.946 --> 00:04:41.626
that's great because somebody else
can jump in and build on an idea."

00:04:41.626 --> 00:04:46.556
Another sort of easy trick I
have is to start with a kind

00:04:46.676 --> 00:04:48.976
of a reflective moment,
a moment of silence

00:04:48.976 --> 00:04:50.506
or just a little moment of writing.

00:04:50.506 --> 00:04:53.896
&gt;&gt;Remembering you want to have your
feet firmly planted on the floor.

00:04:54.186 --> 00:04:55.896
Then the next thing you want
to do is focus on the breath.

00:04:59.686 --> 00:05:00.106
Aah. How was that.

00:05:00.406 --> 00:05:04.066
&gt;&gt;You know, it only takes a couple
minutes, but just having that moment

00:05:04.246 --> 00:05:06.546
to let out the anxiety is great,

00:05:06.546 --> 00:05:09.056
because it really can improve
their concentration for the class,

00:05:09.246 --> 00:05:12.296
so that they're able to have that
kind of engaged conversation.

00:05:12.296 --> 00:05:14.226
&gt;&gt;And if you guys need
a little bit of extra--

00:05:14.226 --> 00:05:18.406
&gt;&gt;What's important is to have a
set of guidelines for the students.

00:05:18.456 --> 00:05:21.196
&gt;&gt;In this conversation,
we're going to have--

00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:23.366
I'm going to have you guys
write down the questions,

00:05:23.496 --> 00:05:26.086
and then talk to each other about
the conversation, about the book,

00:05:26.456 --> 00:05:28.376
and I'm going to sort of
step back and take notes.

00:05:28.636 --> 00:05:30.126
And I'll do a little bit of guiding,

00:05:30.126 --> 00:05:31.356
but you guys are going
to talk to each other.

00:05:31.356 --> 00:05:35.256
&gt;&gt;And there's three particular
roles that students will fill.

00:05:35.536 --> 00:05:39.996
One is the scribe role, where
one student is taking notes

00:05:39.996 --> 00:05:43.316
on the conversation, so that all the
other students can be fully engaged

00:05:43.596 --> 00:05:45.486
in the conversation that's happening.

00:05:45.846 --> 00:05:47.876
Another role is a little map

00:05:48.276 --> 00:05:51.706
where one student is
monitoring who's speaking when

00:05:51.706 --> 00:05:55.706
and they draw these sort of
diagrams so that there's a visual map

00:05:55.706 --> 00:05:57.286
of how the conversation is going.

00:05:57.286 --> 00:06:00.166
&gt;&gt;The other thing I just want to
point out since I'm showing these

00:06:00.216 --> 00:06:02.966
to you is, would you say
this is a good conversation?

00:06:03.366 --> 00:06:03.606
&gt;&gt;Yes.

00:06:03.606 --> 00:06:06.856
&gt;&gt;How about that?

00:06:07.116 --> 00:06:07.226
&gt;&gt;No.

00:06:07.226 --> 00:06:10.716
&gt;&gt;Julie: And then the third
role is the moderator role.

00:06:10.916 --> 00:06:15.426
&gt;&gt;Hannah: So I was the moderator
and it was my job to make sure

00:06:15.426 --> 00:06:18.236
that we didn't stay on one topic
for too long or move too quickly.

00:06:18.456 --> 00:06:21.006
It was also my job to make
sure that everybody talked.

00:06:21.436 --> 00:06:23.806
&gt;&gt;Okay, I think we should hear
from someone who hasn't talked yet.

00:06:24.316 --> 00:06:27.076
&gt;&gt;Boy: Thea, Caroline, Noah, Max.

00:06:27.186 --> 00:06:31.766
&gt;&gt;Boy: Well, Athena's making him
seem godlike, so I think he's just

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:33.486
like taking a gamble
at establishing--

00:06:33.486 --> 00:06:35.086
&gt;&gt;Hannah: When we're having a
conversation, you really feel

00:06:35.086 --> 00:06:37.036
like you're part of the conversation
and not like, oh, you're sitting

00:06:37.036 --> 00:06:38.886
in the back of class and you
can't actually see the person

00:06:38.956 --> 00:06:40.316
who's talking.

00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:44.446
And also, it's a great way for people
to exchange ideas back and forth

00:06:44.546 --> 00:06:45.896
and sort of have everyone contribute.

00:06:45.976 --> 00:06:50.996
&gt;&gt;Girl: Who do you think is the
modern equivalent to Odysseus?

00:06:50.996 --> 00:06:51.766
&gt;&gt;Boy: Tebow.

00:06:52.426 --> 00:06:53.406
&gt;&gt;Julie: In addition to setting

00:06:53.406 --> 00:06:55.516
up the conversation
the first time around,

00:06:55.856 --> 00:06:58.406
at the end of each
Harkness discussion,

00:06:58.726 --> 00:07:01.186
to sort of take a few minutes to
sort of check in with the students

00:07:01.216 --> 00:07:02.496
and ask, "Well, how did we do?"

00:07:02.766 --> 00:07:03.436
&gt;&gt;How did you do?

00:07:03.556 --> 00:07:05.386
How do you think that went?

00:07:05.386 --> 00:07:06.206
&gt;&gt;Hannah: I liked that.

00:07:06.316 --> 00:07:09.116
&gt;&gt;Girl: I mean, I feel like I learned
a lot more when we discuss things

00:07:09.116 --> 00:07:10.866
and we get deeper into it, so.

00:07:11.186 --> 00:07:13.306
&gt;&gt;Julie: Great, Eli,
how does it look?

00:07:14.476 --> 00:07:17.496
&gt;&gt;And I like to keep those
maps so that we can kind

00:07:17.496 --> 00:07:20.546
of chart the progress in
terms of Harkness discussions.

00:07:20.546 --> 00:07:24.576
&gt;&gt;And those who talked not so much,
right, maybe step in a little bit,

00:07:24.576 --> 00:07:26.126
and if other people can help them,

00:07:26.126 --> 00:07:27.986
because it really is
a group effort, right?

00:07:27.986 --> 00:07:30.486
Some people just need
a little bit more help

00:07:30.486 --> 00:07:32.326
and a little bit of space to do it.

00:07:32.376 --> 00:07:35.426
So next time we do it, let's be
mindful of that, but I think overall,

00:07:35.426 --> 00:07:37.006
you guys did a really terrific job.

00:07:37.176 --> 00:07:41.256
&gt;&gt;Teaching in this discussion-based
way is really the most challenging

00:07:41.256 --> 00:07:43.596
but also the most exciting
form of teaching I know.

00:07:43.596 --> 00:07:45.486
It never gets old, and honestly,

00:07:45.486 --> 00:07:47.466
I feel like I still have
a lot to learn about it.

00:07:47.466 --> 00:07:53.236
&gt;&gt;Monique: I think the special
sauce at College Prep is really

00:07:53.236 --> 00:07:58.606
about the kind of community values
that kids find when they come here.

00:07:58.916 --> 00:08:01.776
They think they're coming for a
first rate academic preparation,

00:08:02.046 --> 00:08:05.286
and that certainly is the
centerpiece of what we're doing,

00:08:05.416 --> 00:08:08.566
but what I think makes us special
and distinct is actually this culture

00:08:08.886 --> 00:08:13.006
of respecting the individual, of
celebrating the small victories,

00:08:13.086 --> 00:08:18.036
of kind of enthusiastically embracing
all parts of the learning experience.
