00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.350
In the last video where we generalized

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.940
the linear consumption function.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.605
I said that the tax, the
total amount of taxes,

00:00:08.605 --> 00:00:11.017
the aggregate taxes are constant,

00:00:11.017 --> 00:00:12.600
all of these were constants right here.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.940
You can merge them into a constant

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.736
that ended up being our
independent variable intercept

00:00:17.736 --> 00:00:18.803
right over here.

00:00:18.803 --> 00:00:23.351
YouTube user nilsor1337
asks a very interesting

00:00:23.351 --> 00:00:24.519
and good question.

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:29.069
"Aren't taxes in some way a
function of aggregate income?

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:30.609
"In most modern economies

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:32.273
"people pay a percentage of their income.

00:00:32.273 --> 00:00:36.401
"In general, the tax base
grows as aggregate income

00:00:36.401 --> 00:00:38.518
"or as GDP grows.

00:00:38.518 --> 00:00:41.187
"Is it appropriate to make this constant?"

00:00:41.187 --> 00:00:43.118
The simple answer is it
depends on how carefully

00:00:43.118 --> 00:00:44.682
you want to model it.

00:00:44.682 --> 00:00:46.680
In some cases you might just say,

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.451
"Well, let's just assume
that this is a bulk tax.

00:00:48.451 --> 00:00:50.269
"We're just trying to
understand one aspect of it."

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:52.722
You will see that in
some economics courses

00:00:52.722 --> 00:00:54.179
or some economics textbooks.

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:56.600
The other way is you
could actually model it

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.715
a little bit more realistic.

00:00:57.715 --> 00:00:59.516
You could say, "Hey, taxes really are

00:00:59.516 --> 00:01:01.448
"a function of aggregate income."

00:01:01.448 --> 00:01:05.315
We could say that T really
is going to be equal

00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:06.718
to some tax rate.

00:01:06.718 --> 00:01:12.585
I'll write that as a lower
case t times aggregate income.

00:01:12.585 --> 00:01:15.387
In a place like the U.S.,
this might be close to

00:01:15.387 --> 00:01:18.650
the 30% of aggregate income or 20%.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.248
Whatever it might be or aggregate income

00:01:20.248 --> 00:01:22.782
is what is going to go for taxes.

00:01:22.782 --> 00:01:23.969
If you do it this way,

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:25.315
and you substitute back to this

00:01:25.315 --> 00:01:28.586
you could actually get an
expression for consumption

00:01:28.586 --> 00:01:29.804
in terms of aggregate income

00:01:29.804 --> 00:01:34.922
that takes into consideration
the idea that taxes

00:01:34.922 --> 00:01:36.651
are function of aggregate income.

00:01:36.651 --> 00:01:38.048
Just to do that algebraically,

00:01:38.048 --> 00:01:39.789
we can rewrite this expression up here.

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:47.648
You have aggregate consumption =
my marginal propensity to consume

00:01:47.648 --> 00:01:55.556
times aggregate income +
autonomous consumption,

00:01:55.556 --> 00:01:57.941
the amount that would be
consumed no matter what.

00:01:57.941 --> 00:02:01.861
Minus the marginal propensity to consume,

00:02:01.861 --> 00:02:02.997
shows up again.

00:02:02.997 --> 00:02:07.024
Instead of writing T right over here,

00:02:07.024 --> 00:02:10.799
I'm going to write lower case t x Y,

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:14.440
tax rate times aggregate income.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.132
Times the tax rate times aggregate income.

00:02:19.132 --> 00:02:22.361
I just took this, instead
of writing upper case T,

00:02:22.361 --> 00:02:25.463
I wrote lower case t
times aggregate income

00:02:25.463 --> 00:02:27.272
and they should be the same thing.

00:02:27.272 --> 00:02:30.671
But now we've expressed t as a
function of aggregate income.

00:02:30.671 --> 00:02:32.529
Now we can merge both of these,

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:34.339
these are something
times aggregate income.

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:36.196
We can combine those 2 terms.

00:02:36.196 --> 00:02:40.737
This one and this one write over here.

00:02:40.737 --> 00:02:46.599
If we factor our a
common factor of c1 x Y,

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.535
we get, let me write it this way.

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:50.241
Actually, let me just combine them first

00:02:50.241 --> 00:02:52.165
so that the algebra doesn't confuse you.

00:02:52.165 --> 00:03:00.401
We get C = c1 x Y.

00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:02.834
Marginal propensity to
consume times aggregate income

00:03:02.834 --> 00:03:04.209
and I'm going to write this one.

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.906
Minus the marginal propensity
to consume times ...

00:03:08.906 --> 00:03:10.160
I'll switch the order here.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.415
Well, let me not switch the order,

00:03:11.415 --> 00:03:13.338
times the tax rate,

00:03:13.338 --> 00:03:15.669
not just the aggregate total tax value

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:22.295
but the actual tax rate
times aggregate income.

00:03:22.295 --> 00:03:23.734
That's those 2 terms there

00:03:23.734 --> 00:03:26.400
and then we're just left with
the autonomous consumption.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.150
So, plus the autonomous consumption.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.265
Over here, we have a common factor.

00:03:31.265 --> 00:03:34.471
We can factor out the c1 and the Y,

00:03:34.471 --> 00:03:36.338
or essentially the marginal
propensity to consume

00:03:36.338 --> 00:03:38.149
and the aggregate income.

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:40.648
This is just algebraic
manipulation right over here.

00:03:40.648 --> 00:03:45.525
We get aggregate consumption is equal to,

00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:56.609
let's see, we could write this c1(1 - t)Y.

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.070
You can multiply this out to verify.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.397
If you multiply it all out

00:03:59.397 --> 00:04:04.296
then the 1st term is c1(1)Y
is this right over here

00:04:04.296 --> 00:04:08.291
and c1(-t)Y is this term right over here.

00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:13.397
Then you're left with your
autonomous consumption.

00:04:13.397 --> 00:04:14.707
This actually makes a lot of sense

00:04:14.707 --> 00:04:15.962
because when you write it like this,

00:04:15.962 --> 00:04:17.289
when you write it like this

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:19.044
you could look at this
term right over here.

00:04:19.044 --> 00:04:20.998
What is this term right over here?

00:04:20.998 --> 00:04:26.002
Well, (1 - t)Y, if the tax rate is 30%

00:04:26.002 --> 00:04:28.964
then this 1 - 30% is going to be 70%.

00:04:28.964 --> 00:04:31.064
70% x aggregate income,

00:04:31.064 --> 00:04:33.068
that's essentially what
people get in their pockets.

00:04:33.068 --> 00:04:34.797
This whole term right over here

00:04:34.797 --> 00:04:36.868
is essentially disposable income.

00:04:36.868 --> 00:04:42.400
Disposable income right over here.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.464
We could actually,

00:04:43.464 --> 00:04:44.963
if we wanted to write this
as some other variable

00:04:44.963 --> 00:04:46.207
we could just put that
variable right over there

00:04:46.207 --> 00:04:47.465
and say it's disposable income

00:04:47.465 --> 00:04:49.297
and then it actually becomes a very simple

00:04:49.297 --> 00:04:50.398
thing to graph.

00:04:50.398 --> 00:04:51.998
We could graph this 2 different ways.

00:04:51.998 --> 00:04:56.722
If we wanted to write a
function of aggregate income

00:04:56.722 --> 00:04:59.292
we would graph it like this.

00:04:59.292 --> 00:05:01.374
Now, when we express it this way,

00:05:01.374 --> 00:05:03.796
taxes as a function of aggregate income

00:05:03.796 --> 00:05:06.208
now our vertical intercept.

00:05:06.208 --> 00:05:07.671
This is aggregate consumption.

00:05:07.671 --> 00:05:10.796
Our vertical intercept is
this term right over here.

00:05:10.796 --> 00:05:12.928
That is C [not]

00:05:12.928 --> 00:05:15.131
and our slope is all of this business.

00:05:15.131 --> 00:05:25.357
The slope of our line
is going to be C1(1 - t)

00:05:25.357 --> 00:05:27.118
and this right over here,

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:29.397
the independent variable
is aggregate income.

00:05:29.397 --> 00:05:32.791
Another option, we could
set some other variable

00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:36.057
to what we could say disposable income.

00:05:36.057 --> 00:05:43.996
Let me call it Y disposable = (1 - t)Y

00:05:43.996 --> 00:05:45.260
then we could write this.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.621
It's essentially equal to this
business right over there.

00:05:47.621 --> 00:05:50.131
Then we could rewrite the
consumption function as

00:05:50.131 --> 00:05:56.203
aggregate consumption =
marginal propensity to consume

00:05:56.203 --> 00:06:01.449
times disposable income + sum
level of autonomous consumption.

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:09.193
plus sum level of autonomous consumption.

00:06:09.193 --> 00:06:10.540
This actually takes us back to the basics.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.533
This takes us back to our
very original situation here

00:06:14.533 --> 00:06:16.203
where we had some autonomous consumption

00:06:16.203 --> 00:06:18.783
plus our marginal propensity to consume

00:06:18.783 --> 00:06:20.791
times disposable income.

00:06:20.791 --> 00:06:22.617
If we wanted to plot it this way

00:06:22.617 --> 00:06:24.122
as a function of disposable income,

00:06:24.122 --> 00:06:25.365
not aggregate income

00:06:25.365 --> 00:06:28.766
then it would look like this.

00:06:28.766 --> 00:06:31.087
This is consumption, and now
this is an aggregate income,

00:06:31.087 --> 00:06:34.021
this is disposable income

00:06:34.021 --> 00:06:38.921
which is the same thing as (1 - t)Y.

00:06:38.921 --> 00:06:42.000
Now, still our vertical
intercept is C [not]

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.665
and our line slope is the
marginal propensity to consume.

00:06:46.665 --> 00:06:49.330
This is C1 just like that.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.789
All of these are completely
valid consumption functions

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:55.414
and I thank nilsor1337
for bringing up a topic

00:06:55.414 --> 00:06:57.161
that actually was a
cause of confusion for me

00:06:57.161 --> 00:06:58.590
because it really does depend.

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:01.255
Because I thought the way, he or she,

00:07:01.255 --> 00:07:02.662
originally thought about the problem.

00:07:02.662 --> 00:07:04.082
Well, taxes are a function

00:07:04.082 --> 00:07:07.858
and a lot of econ books tend
to treat this as a constant.

00:07:07.858 --> 00:07:10.162
That is actually just
an assumption they make

00:07:10.162 --> 00:07:11.923
to often simplify the calculations.

00:07:11.923 --> 00:07:13.653
If they don't want to make that assumption

00:07:13.653 --> 00:07:17.524
you can still show that
it is a linear function,

00:07:17.524 --> 00:07:21.296
that aggregate consumption
is still a linear function

00:07:21.296 --> 00:07:25.000
of aggregate income.
