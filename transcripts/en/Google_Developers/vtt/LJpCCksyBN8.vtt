DON DODGE: Hello everyone.

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.720
My name's Don Dodge, and this
is Google Root Access.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.110
Today my guest is Jennifer
Reuting,

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.060
founder and CEO of DocRun.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.190
Jennifer is a serial
entrepreneur.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.790
She's started several companies
and today we'll talk

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.490
a little bit about
how that went.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.290
Welcome, Jennifer.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.130
JENNIFER REUTING: Hi.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.050
DON DODGE: All right.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:27.280
So you started InCorp and
MyLLC, and your current

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.580
company, DocRun.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.030
JENNIFER REUTING: Correct.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.880
DON DODGE: So when did you
start your first company?

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.090
JENNIFER REUTING: I started
my first company at 17.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.570
I started college early, so I
was in college at the time,

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.360
and a typical college dropout.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.880
I did end up going back for
a time to get my degree.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.940
But yeah, pretty early.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.160
DON DODGE: 17 years old you
started your first company.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.050
Wow.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.810
So what experience did
you have before you

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:58.820
started that company?

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.680
You couldn't have had much.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.890
You were barely out
of high school.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:02.430
JENNIFER REUTING: No.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.680
Yeah, I had no experience.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.700
And actually I don't think that
I would have started the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.290
company had I had the experience
that I have now,

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.080
because the market that I was
penetrating was actually

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.790
really evolved at the time.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.630
It registered agent company
and corporate compliance.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.010
And our two largest competitors
are both public

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.080
companies at this point.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.080
So it was super-saturated
and I just had no

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.940
idea what I was doing.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:34.780
So all I knew was that I wanted
to create value and

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.460
just see those checks
rolling in.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.940
It was just about the number of
customers that we could get

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:40.420
at that point.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.230
It was such a single-minded
focus.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.690
DON DODGE: So you're
17 years old.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.910
You don't have any
entrepreneurialship

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.060
experience, probably haven't
worked that many jobs.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.760
How did you decide to
do incorporations

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.260
or registered agent?

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.380
At 17, I didn't even know
such a thing existed.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.370
JENNIFER REUTING: I actually
fell into it.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.789
I don't think that when you
aren't setting out to be an

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.330
entrepreneur, you just sort
of fall into things.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.950
And I was working for these
investment bankers.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.500
I was really tired of working
for people, frankly.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.050
DON DODGE: At 17.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.980
JENNIFER REUTING: That
was driving me.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.325
Yeah.

00:02:22.325 --> 00:02:26.530
I actually had just gotten fired
by a retail job for a

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.700
stupid reason.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.800
It was the stupidest reason.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.280
It defied all logic for me.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.640
And I was like, I'm never
working for anybody again.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.240
And then I ended up getting
a job for these investment

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.140
bankers as a secretary.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.950
And what we were doing
at the time was

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.580
taking companies public.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.905
And involved in that is forming
the companies, and we

00:02:49.905 --> 00:02:52.160
were also the registered agent
for the companies.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.370
And one day I come into
the office and the

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.090
place had been ransacked.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.520
And my bosses had fled
the country.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.410
Yeah, one went to Mexico.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.930
The other one went
to Switzerland.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.010
And all the other employees were
like, well, I guess we're

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.250
out of a job, right?

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.380
And I knew and I told them that
we paid the office rent

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.800
for the rest of the
year, because we

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.980
paid it all up front.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.540
And so I was like, well, we
have to do something.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.430
And nobody else was game,
so it was just me.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.500
And I was like, I can't
take companies public.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.680
That involves a whole
slew of people.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.080
But I was accepting the
service of process.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.630
As a registered agent,
that's what you do.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:36.570
It's really easy.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.880
Basically, you accept mail
and you forward it.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.140
And we charge companies
$200 a year for that.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.880
And I'm like, well,
that's easy.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:45.590
I can do that.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:46.930
Anybody can do that.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.980
And I'll you need
is an office.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.540
And so I started mailing
to companies--

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.330
because it was public
information, Secretary of

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.900
State database--

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.840
basically offering them
a free year of

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.770
registered agent service.

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.890
And I'm like, if I can
just get through one

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.080
year I'll be golden.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.030
Because in my 17-year-old brain
I was like, if I can

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.400
charge $200 a year, and if I get
1,000 companies, I'm like,

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.100
that $200,000 a year.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.890
I'm going to be rich!

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:25.610
And so I just started mailing,
and people started responding.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.450
And then I started getting
my scholarship

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:29.700
checks in the mail.

00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:35.240
And I was like, well, I could
use it for postage or I could

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.680
sit through a lot of
math courses that I

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.180
didn't want to take.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.820
And that was the genesis
of InCorp.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:50.550
And now we have over 60
employees, and we're set to do

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.190
well over $20 million
this year.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.440
DON DODGE: So you started InCorp
at 17 years old and it

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.450
still exists today.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:57.450
JENNIFER REUTING: Yeah.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.110
DON DODGE: Wow.

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.210
That's amazing.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:07.330
So most entrepreneurs that I
talk to, they get a passion

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.570
about some thing or they want to
improve something or change

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.700
the world and they go
and start a company.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.140
Your story is a little
different.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.400
You found an opportunity, you
had a year or free office

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.680
space, and you knew
a few things and

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.980
said, why not do this.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.370
Did you get passionate
about incorporations?

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.390
And where did you find your
drive to build this business

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.640
and make it big?

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.810
JENNIFER REUTING: My parents
didn't have a lot of money.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.260
They were always having
money problems.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.770
And I didn't have the
easiest childhood.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:46.650
It wasn't hard.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.480
It wasn't like anything
terrible.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.980
I know my mom's probably
watching this.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.760
Got to be careful there,
otherwise I'll be getting a

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.050
phone call.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.650
But I think that some people are
running towards things and

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.070
other people are running
away from things.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.150
And I think at that time it
was just really, nobody

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.230
believed in me.

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:11.540
I remember I wanted money for
school, for school books.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.585
And one of my relatives was
like, well, you're not going

00:06:13.585 --> 00:06:15.500
to graduate anyway.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.130
And they would say things
like that and it

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:18.920
would just drive me.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.230
I'm like, well, screw you.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.880
I can do it.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:21.470
I'm going to do it.

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:22.360
I'm going to be independent.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.000
I'm going to accomplish
something.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.080
And then it just kind of became
a little bit of--

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:37.170
I found just one key metric that
I got fulfillment out of,

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:39.940
which was the number of
customers that we got.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.530
Because the number of customers
that we got was

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.940
really my shining thing where,
in the future, this is going

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.820
to be what's going
to sustain me.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.680
And so people may not understand
what I'm doing now.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.330
And I'm sleeping in a sleeping
bag on the floor of the office

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.940
because I'm broke.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.900
But I know that as that number
rose, I knew that that was

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.290
like, hey, I'm going
to be balling.

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:05.130
I'm going to be somebody, and
I'm going to actually prove

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:05.590
them wrong.

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:09.890
And then after a while, you
get used to the success.

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.530
And that's when, for me, it was
the thing that drove me

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:18.740
became more vision and wanting
to make a mark on the world.

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.355
But it definitely wasn't
the catalyst.

00:07:20.355 --> 00:07:24.740
I think the catalyst more just
proving people wrong.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.285
I was a nutty 17-year-old.

00:07:28.285 --> 00:07:31.390
DON DODGE: Well, you've
certainly proven people wrong.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.820
You've now started
three companies.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:38.960
The latest one, DocRun, tell me
a little bit about DocRun.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:39.740
What do you do there?

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.490
JENNIFER REUTING: So DocRun
actually, the idea for it came

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:45.790
out of the other companies,
because one of my other

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.570
companies is a formation company
and we do a lot with

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:49.305
small businesses.

00:07:49.305 --> 00:07:52.190
And so I interact a lot with
some small businesses and

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.150
entrepreneurs in even writing
LLCs for dummies, I've

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.900
interacted a lot with that
world and gotten

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:58.980
passionate about it.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:04.020
And the one thing that's just
become so clear to me is that

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.540
people form their businesses.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.360
It's really easy.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:12.530
You can go on a number of
websites, pay $100 or so, and

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:14.040
you get your documents mail.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.980
But they have no concept of what
to do after that point.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:19.710
They don't know how to bring
on partners, or they don't

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:24.400
know what happens if two of the
partners want to kick out

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.290
another partner, or how to hire

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:29.630
employees and do it legally.

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:33.049
And what I was also finding
was that a lot of the

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:36.250
entrepreneurs aren't typically
what we experience in the tech

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:37.200
world, people that
are going out and

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.080
getting funded, et cetera.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.240
It's the people that are getting
laid off and maybe

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.920
have $10,000 in their savings
account to start a business,

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.240
because they really
don't have any

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.930
alternative other than welfare.

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.040
But that's the beauty
of America.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.290
Right?

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.670
We're very entrepreneurial.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:00.220
So they can't afford the
heavy legal fees

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:01.440
that lawyers charge.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.000
And so what I decided with
DocRun was that I wanted to

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.450
create a software solution
that really took out the

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:13.560
drafting of the contracts and
agreements away from lawyers

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.290
to be able to make it affordable
for people.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.920
In that way, they can access
lawyers for just the

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.380
high-level stuff, for the
guidance, for the stuff that

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.690
they're really therefore.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:23.900
Right?

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.240
And that's where all the
value is provided.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:31.130
So we're breaking down that
barrier to entry for small

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:33.230
businesses, to really
be able to embrace

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:34.265
the law and be legit.

00:09:34.265 --> 00:09:40.240
And business owners can sleep
at night knowing that they

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.650
have partnership agreements.

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:45.540
You'd be surprised how many
partnerships have no contracts

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.826
between the partners.

00:09:47.826 --> 00:09:51.770
DON DODGE: So DocRun provides
legal documents for small

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:54.960
businesses, employment
agreements.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.940
What kinds of things
are involved?

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:01.510
JENNIFER REUTING: So really,
it's partnership agreements,

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:05.310
bylaws, all the formalities
if you have a corporation,

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:08.790
employment contracts, offer
letters, stock option plans--

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:11.340
if you want to venture into that
for your business that's

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.720
now accessible for average
entrepreneurs--

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:20.220
profit sharing plans,
termination letters,

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.580
everything from terms of use
for your website, privacy

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:29.090
policies, anything relating
bringing on partners or

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:33.670
removing partners, and selling
shares for investment, raising

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:38.002
capital, or even dissolving
your business.

00:10:38.002 --> 00:10:42.430
DON DODGE: So you found a
problem of forming companies

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:43.740
and having these agreements.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.390
They were very, very
expensive.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:48.630
And you thought you could do
it for less money and save

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:53.260
people money and make money
in the same time.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.670
What did you know about this?

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:58.360
Or is it, once again,
it didn't matter.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.246
You could just figure
it out and do it?

00:11:01.246 --> 00:11:04.530
JENNIFER REUTING: Well, when I
was writing the first edition

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:12.120
of LLCs for Dummies, I knew
operating agreements are very

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.260
crucial for a limited
liability company.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.020
In some states, you're not even
valid if you don't have

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.290
an operating agreement
in place.

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:21.250
In other states, if you don't
have a specific provision in

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:22.890
your operating agreement,
it's not even valid.

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:27.140
And so some of these
solutions, the

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.740
fill-in-the-blank forms
you get aren't really

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.140
state-specific.

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:36.870
And so when I was writing the
book, I just decided here's

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:37.360
how to do it.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.650
I'm going to show you a broad
thing, but really

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:39.820
just go to a lawyer.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:43.550
And after the book was
published, I get about 4 to 5

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.480
Ask Jennifer questions
a day on the site.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:50.390
And I just got a
huge blowback.

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:53.500
So people were saying,
I can't afford it.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:57.670
They wanted a $5,000 retainer,
or just an astronomical fee.

00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:58.550
And what's another solution?

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:00.780
And they just kept
asking me that.

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:04.510
And so when I wrote the second
edition I'm like, I'm not

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:06.990
making that mistake again.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:12.040
I went to a lot of attorneys,
and I was asking them, these

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:12.610
are my friends.

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.020
I'm like, maybe we can do
something that's at a price

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.350
point that people can afford.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:24.040
And they just weren't willing or
able to do it because they

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.710
have their own school
loans to pay off.

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:29.880
And it just wasn't really
offering a viable profit

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.390
margin for them.

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:35.140
And so at that point I was
like, well, I have

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:37.190
to write this book.

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:39.300
I have to put something
in there.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.800
I'm not going to subject myself
to another two years of

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.290
complaints by readers.

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:46.710
So I went and purchased a domain
name called DocRun.

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:50.250
And in the book I was like,
just go to DocRun.

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:52.910
And I had no idea what I was
going to do or how I

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:53.660
was going to do it.

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.180
And I like, well, I have
some time before--

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:02.420
I just had to create
something.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:03.670
So I had to figure it out.

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:07.460
DON DODGE: So you created the
need for DocRun by writing the

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:09.640
book, and then you had
to scramble to--

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.220
JENNIFER REUTING: Figure out
what the solution was.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.280
Yeah.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:15.210
And really, when you look at
what an attorney does and how

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:17.900
he create contracts, it's
something that's really akin

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.875
to being automated
with software.

00:13:23.926 --> 00:13:25.480
DON DODGE: You're obviously
a woman.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.450
JENNIFER REUTING: I hope so.

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:29.400
DON DODGE: And three-time
entrepreneur.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.570
Are there special challenges
for a woman entrepreneur

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:33.820
starting a company?

00:13:37.515 --> 00:13:39.780
JENNIFER REUTING: Not in tech.

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:45.920
When I started InCorp, I
ended up bringing on a

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.640
partner who is a man.

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:49.700
And half the time--

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.490
And he was just really doing
all the programing.

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:53.030
I was running the business.

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:57.890
And he would even come to me
and get quite clearly upset

00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:00.060
that people just wouldn't
talk to me.

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.780
They wouldn't engage with me.

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:09.250
And I think that after so many
years of that, in that sort of

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:11.440
world, the corporate world
where women especially--

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.020
I was so young.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.950
I had a lie about my age to
everybody, even the employees.

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:20.090
My birthday parties, there was
like, always 16 every year.

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:21.380
I'm sure people started
wondering.

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:29.310
I think that was difficult.

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:33.730
It sort of put me on guard, to
the point where it sort of fed

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:37.760
into that, well, nobody believes
in you anyway, that

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:38.830
sort of thing.

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:42.300
And it's been really fascinating
to me migrating

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.755
over to the tech industry.

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:49.500
It embraces women and
embraces youth.

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:53.780
And had I known this before, I
just would have started in the

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:57.740
tech industry, because I
would have been golden.

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.590
I never would've thought that
anybody would ever invest in

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:03.280
me, even when my company was
successful, because I was

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.600
young and I was a woman,
back then.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.950
And I just had no idea that
there was this amazing

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:13.580
industry that's just so
embracing of people that don't

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:15.390
necessarily fit the norm.

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:23.050
And I think that it's
interesting to me, a lot of

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:28.760
VCs, if they do feel reluctant
to invest in a female founder,

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:32.820
especially a single founder like
myself, I can understand

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.920
it to some extent, because
there aren't any really

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.590
successful female
single founders.

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:48.540
I have my own theories on why
that is, but it hasn't

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:49.910
bothered me.

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:53.550
We have plenty of funding and
plenty of people that believe

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:55.250
in me and want to fund
and back me.

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:56.260
So it's fine.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.240
There hasn't been any
big issues there.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:03.300
And hopefully, I can pave that
way and be one of the people.

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.885
That's something that's really,
personally driving me.

00:16:05.885 --> 00:16:08.380
DON DODGE: So Jennifer, you're
breaking all the rules.

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:12.730
You're young, a woman,
a sole founder.

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:17.450
Most of the time, we want
multiple founders.

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:20.020
And you've raised money
and been successful.

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:24.370
So tell me about how it went,
raising money and starting a

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:25.770
tech company.

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:28.750
JENNIFER REUTING: Oh, it was
definitely hard because I'm a

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:29.550
sole founder.

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:31.190
But I wanted to be.

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:33.740
I'm a little bit--

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:37.400
It kind of pissed me off that
people would say, oh, we only

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.940
invest in teams or, oh, where's

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:41.210
the technical component.

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:47.470
I think that at the time, I
was very there are no sole

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:48.800
female founders.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.380
But we're good at
business too.

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.410
So I actually was pretty
adamant about

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:57.740
being a sole founder.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:59.460
And that was interesting.

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:02.480
It definitely was interesting.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.440
I had to learn how to pitch.

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.790
I'm not good at asking
for anything.

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:10.599
I'm very, very--

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:13.770
I can do things myself.

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:19.180
I'm actually good at asking for
advice, because to me when

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:22.040
you ask somebody for advice
it's a complement to them.

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.109
So really, it's an
equal exchange.

00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:25.339
I don't know.

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:28.590
But the idea of going out and
asking for capital, Ive never

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:29.350
raised capital before.

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:33.580
And I was always so proud of
never taking on any debt with

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:36.070
my company, never raising
any capital.

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:40.150
I was just proud of
bootstrapping.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:43.630
But this needed to be the next
chapter in my evolution as an

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:44.260
entrepreneur.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:48.300
And embracing that was
something I needed.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.790
It was a personal journey for
me that I had to take.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:54.180
And learning how to use
PowerPoint, oh my gosh.

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:55.210
I hate PowerPoint.

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:58.130
If I could raise capital
without pitching on a

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:01.860
PowerPoint, that
would be ideal.

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.180
DON DODGE: Maybe that's
your next company.

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:05.090
JENNIFER REUTING: Yeah.

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:07.200
There you go.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.730
I'm still not into the
PowerPoint thing.

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:12.240
I'll have to get better
at that, for sure.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.550
DON DODGE: So you seem
to like challenges.

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:17.840
And that seems to motivate
what you do.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.060
So my question is what
does motivate you?

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:24.450
JENNIFER REUTING: You
know, it's funny.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:33.130
The seed of the idea and really
the overall passion for

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:38.510
wanting to just disrupt this
industry and to make it so

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:41.760
that people own the law.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:46.410
Lawyers have charged this
premium for knowledge.

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:49.320
And people haven't really
had access to it.

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:52.380
And they feel this dissociation
with it, when in

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:54.830
reality people own the law.

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:59.480
It's for us to use and to
protect ourselves with.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:04.750
And so that's the overarching
thing that drives me.

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:08.390
But I think also on a day-to-day
basis is looking at

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:12.980
my team, the people that have
taken these ridiculous pay

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:19.910
cuts to come work for me, and
investors, and it's just

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:23.210
knowing that I don't want to
let those people down.

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:27.780
So on a day-to-day basis, it's
really just, I can't let these

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:29.370
people down.

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:31.140
They believed in me.

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:35.800
I will die before I fail you.

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.530
And I want to make the
journey worth it.

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:41.570
I want them to be like, that
was an amazing journey.

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:45.190
And we had bumps in the road,
and there were times, and

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:47.745
there were great times.

00:19:47.745 --> 00:19:50.920
And at of the day, the success
and feeling the mutual

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.792
success, and I want to
give that to them.

00:19:53.792 --> 00:19:55.500
DON DODGE: What about the
other side of that?

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:59.600
What about when the employees
let you down and you have to--

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:00.970
Have you ever had
to fire someone?

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:02.710
JENNIFER REUTING: Oh yeah.

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:03.960
Recently.

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:07.810
It was tough.

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:09.060
It was really tough.

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.470
It's not just about firing
somebody for poor performance.

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:19.210
I recently had to let somebody
go because he was an

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:23.110
executive, because there was
just a disparity in the

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:27.400
vision, in the core value
of what I'm trying to

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.680
accomplish at DocRun.

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:33.160
And when this person's running
over half of your team and

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.030
interacting with them on a
day-to-day basis and just sort

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:43.870
of circumventing the vision
you're trying to bring people

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:50.140
in on, I had to let
that person go.

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:56.430
And the problem was is that he
was a great employee, and he

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:59.500
was passionate.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.220
So there was really
nothing wrong.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:05.800
And he'd sacrificed a lot.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:10.280
But it just was one of those
things where there can only

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.080
really be one vision.

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:15.980
And when there's something
that's completely conflicting,

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:17.220
especially lawyers--

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:19.360
that's the difficulty of having
a company that's trying

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:24.060
to disrupt the legal industry,
and it's full of lawyers--

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.840
you have to keep very close
guard that we're on the same

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:30.090
page, that we're not slipping
into that legal sort of

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:34.830
mindset of making this a
product for lawyers.

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:41.860
Or we don't want to dumb down
our consumers or to dumb down

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:43.110
our demographic.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:46.340
Yes.

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:48.146
The answer is yes.

00:21:48.146 --> 00:21:52.220
DON DODGE: So how do you keep
that vision and passion and

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:54.020
everyone on the same page?

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:56.680
Are there things that
you do every day

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:59.120
to make that stronger?

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:03.136
Or is it just a natural
leadership kind of thing?

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.080
JENNIFER REUTING: I was almost
doing it too much, to the

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:10.730
point where there was a little
bit of backlash.

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:13.740
People were like, OK, we need
to stop having all of these

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:17.370
meetings where we're talking
about vision.

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:21.570
So I think that I've pretty
indoctrinated everybody.

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:22.580
We know where we're heading.

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:31.670
And now, vision needs to
permeate everything.

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:32.350
Right?

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:37.040
So in your conversations, when
I'm talking to employees about

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:37.730
certain things--

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:40.310
Like even just today I was
talking to somebody about the

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:45.940
tone of our help content, just
helping people, guiding them

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:48.390
through the process, and what
the tone should be.

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:54.670
And having a clear vision,
saying, OK well, we want to

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:57.220
empower people so we're not
going to talk down to them,

00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:59.670
but we still want to
be approachable.

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:02.260
It sort of permeates every
aspect of your business.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:05.420
And to me, one of things I'm
working on right now that I

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:08.490
feel like a lot of entrepreneurs
don't spend

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:10.950
enough time on is their brand.

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:13.200
Because the brand is the
vision incarnate.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:17.590
It's the representation of the
vision, visually, and just how

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:20.670
you present yourself
to the user.

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:26.120
And so just in the same way that
a brand permeates your

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:28.050
marketing, in all aspects
of your marketing

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:29.080
it needs to be cohesive.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:32.660
I think your vision needs to
permeate your communication

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:37.140
with your team, and just
making sure that you're

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:39.740
consistent, that you're not
deviating from it, and

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:45.260
checking yourself to make sure
that you're not being a

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:47.020
heat-seeking missile and getting
excited by something

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.305
that's not really part
of the core vision.

00:23:49.305 --> 00:23:51.710
DON DODGE: So DocRun
competes with some

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:53.600
pretty significant companies.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:57.790
Legal Zoom is a competitor and
there might be others.

00:23:57.790 --> 00:24:00.660
They advertise on television,
so you're up against some

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:02.350
pretty big competitors.

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:08.230
How do you work on the brand and
the vision to break out so

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:09.560
people know who you are?

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.650
JENNIFER REUTING: Well, the
irony is that these

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:15.180
competitors like Legal Zoom
don't actually do what we do.

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:19.150
But that doesn't necessarily
make them not a competitor,

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:26.560
because their brand is so
all-encompassing and is just

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:31.320
out there so much that people
generally tend to associate it

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:35.130
with anything that has to do
with business and the law,

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:38.280
especially the name,
Legal Zoom.

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:41.050
So that's been a challenge.

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:44.260
It drives me nuts every time I
say what we do, they're like,

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:44.820
oh, like Legal Zoom.

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:47.290
I'm like, they don't do that!

00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:49.695
We're really picking where those
companies like Legal

00:24:49.695 --> 00:24:54.160
Zoom, even my company, left off,
essentially, after the

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.410
formation process.

00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:00.960
So there are some competitors,
but one of the things that

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:05.960
we're actually doing
is we're just--

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.800
The vision is very different
for where we're headed.

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:10.730
We're making the system
task based.

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:15.120
We're really trying to take the
information that our users

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:20.690
give us during the Q&amp;A and just
tailor the environment to

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:22.220
their individual situation.

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:26.670
Because so much of what's in
the industry right now is

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:30.340
trying to shove people into this
one-size-fits-all thing,

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:32.400
whether it be form documents
or something just like some

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:35.700
general Q&amp;A that fills in
the blanks for you.

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:39.570
And it's inherently broken.

00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:41.760
It's not really even
legally viable.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:44.030
And it's a little dangerous.

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:52.350
So in order for us to evolve,
the system that we've created

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:54.410
we're looking at it from the
opposite perspective, where

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:56.830
we're actually looking at how
we can organically replicate

00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:59.670
the attorney process of creating
a document, rather

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:01.520
than looking at it from
how can we make forms

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.770
easier to fill out.

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:09.500
Hopefully our product will
speak for itself.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:11.720
There will be a price
differentiation there for

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:17.250
sure, which will also
cue people that this

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:18.450
is something better.

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:21.960
In our user testing sessions,
people are given.

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:25.390
I mean, the average price just
for an operating agreement,

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:30.680
that they're saying they would
pay is about $400 to $500.

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:32.970
That's been very promising,
because we're probably not

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:35.890
even a start--

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:39.160
So when they interact with the
product, they really are

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:42.150
looking at it as something
that is akin to

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:43.510
maybe using a lawyer.

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:46.500
And hopefully we can have
lawyers pick up

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:49.058
where we leave off.

00:26:49.058 --> 00:26:50.440
DON DODGE: Excellent.

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:53.560
So you started your first
company at 17.

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:57.420
This is your third company, and
you're still very young.

00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:00.110
Where do you see things
going 5 years from

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:02.720
now, 10 years now?

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.350
Do you have grander visions or
do you always have your eye on

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:10.102
the ball, the thing that's
right in front of you?

00:27:10.102 --> 00:27:11.960
JENNIFER REUTING: I think that
one of the things that women

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:21.010
don't do enough is plan their
lives, as So for me, I do want

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:22.830
to have a family
at some point.

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:25.660
But I'm not going to delude
myself to think that I can do

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:28.800
it while starting a business.

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:32.900
So probably after this, I might
do that for a few years.

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:36.210
And then I'll do another
venture.

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:38.980
I'm not a serial entrepreneur,
ironically.

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:41.480
I'm not the type that I'm like,
OK, this business is

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.885
done, what's the next
thing I can start.

00:27:43.885 --> 00:27:49.400
I have to be just grabbed by
something so much that I

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:50.970
can't not do it.

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:55.370
So it's pretty variable.

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:58.730
I don't know if after I do this
business and we have an

00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:03.370
exit I instantly have that
moment where I can't not do it

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:04.600
with something else.

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:10.380
Or if I don't then, you have to
see where things take you.

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:15.130
I think it's hard to plan
bursts of inspiration.

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:17.820
DON DODGE: I think you hit
it right on the head.

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:22.300
It's that you have to have
passion for the idea, and you

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:24.420
can't think about
anything else.

00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:27.430
I have entrepreneurs come to
me or people with ideas and

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:30.950
they say, I have three or four
ideas for companies, and I

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:33.180
don't know which one to do.

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:35.840
And my answer to them is,
don't do any of them.

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:38.770
Because if there isn't
one idea that is just

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:42.710
all-consuming and you can't
think about anything else then

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:43.170
don't do it.

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:45.280
JENNIFER REUTING: I know.

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:50.310
I feel so lucky when I compare
myself to other entrepreneurs.

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:52.250
We pretty much have product
markets fit.

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:57.170
We're pretty I know exactly what
it is that I want to do.

00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:58.050
It's pretty clear.

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:00.900
And any pivoting that's going to
be going on are going to be

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:05.810
maybe like pricing or how we
deliver the product, smaller

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:08.560
things within the vision.

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:12.500
And I just feel really bad for
entrepreneurs that don't have

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:18.270
that and are wavering between
things, and they don't

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:20.610
necessarily know what it
is that they want.

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:25.380
And I think that the danger is,
yes, you let user testing

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:28.480
drive your iterations, but it
should be within the confines

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:31.330
of a very clear vision.

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:34.410
But when you let user testing
drive your vision and you let

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:43.640
metrics drive your vision,
I just, don't know.

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.580
I feel bad for people that are
always having to pivot and

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:49.740
they don't necessarily
know what it is that

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:50.720
they want to do.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:54.650
DON DODGE: So you're driven by
a vision, and you have a

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:57.355
direction, and nothing's
going to stop you?

00:29:57.355 --> 00:29:59.850
JENNIFER REUTING: Yeah.

00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:02.370
Some of our investors
hate that, for sure.

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:04.920
Because I'm like, no,
we're doing it.

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:07.350
But yeah, I just know.

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:10.300
But that's the luxury
of spending

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:12.150
your time in one market.

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:16.340
I have 10 years experience in
this market and with this

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:17.120
demographic.

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:21.480
And I am so well aware of how to
approach them, how to sell

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:25.560
them, I have sales channels
already established.

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:28.790
The benefit of just
understanding your demographic

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:31.360
and also just being a subject
matter expert on what you're

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:37.370
doing, it's understandable
why investors like that.

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:39.740
Because it just gives you a
confidence and a knowledge

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:42.820
that you can build your vision
off of, so you're

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:45.271
not going in blind.

00:30:45.271 --> 00:30:50.900
DON DODGE: I want to ask you
about special challenges or

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:57.310
differences in being a woman
entrepreneur versus a man.

00:30:57.310 --> 00:31:01.100
Have you found anything that
has been different or

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:04.930
challenging or just different?

00:31:07.822 --> 00:31:12.900
JENNIFER REUTING: Pretty much
every week or so I get asked

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:14.900
to be on a panel about
women entrepreneurs.

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:26.390
I go to a lot of these things.

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:30.450
I get dragged to a
lot of things.

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:36.010
And a lot of women tend
to focus too much

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:38.270
on that, in my opinion.

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:40.560
I'm not a woman entrepreneur.

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.800
I'm an entrepreneur.

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.290
To me, they're very separate.

00:31:44.290 --> 00:31:49.610
I think that women tend to feel
that in order to compete

00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:53.010
they have to be masculine.

00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:56.730
and they have to be something
that they're not.

00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:58.900
They have to be sort of
inauthentic when they're at

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:01.630
the office, or put on a face.

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:03.770
And I've never--

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:04.710
No, that's a lie.

00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:05.730
I have felt that.

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:08.310
I felt a lot when I
was with InCorp.

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:11.440
But I think that over the years
I've just become really,

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.770
really comfortable
with myself.

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:15.810
And I don't see myself as--

00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:22.660
My team follows me because
I do cools things.

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:25.310
I'm smart, and I come up with
good ideas, and I engage them,

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:26.300
and I'm passionate.

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:33.370
And that allows me to be a
little bit silly and just the

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:36.370
kind of girl.

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:40.230
I don't feel the need to cut
my hair short and to be all

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:44.610
over-dominating and domineering
at the office.

00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:49.650
And also, I think that I'm
starting to embrace the

00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:51.730
qualities of being a woman.

00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:54.580
I think that there's a lot of
qualities that women have that

00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:59.100
we need to embrace more,
which is we're very

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:00.850
intuitive by nature.

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:04.510
And I think they just we're
very compassionate.

00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:07.120
And so in my conversations--

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:10.010
and I've watch myself evolve
over time as an entrepreneur

00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:12.645
and as I become more comfortable
with myself.

00:33:12.645 --> 00:33:16.360
It's just a part
of growing too.

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:22.370
But now in my conversations,
when I fire people, I don't

00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:23.960
have that guard up
that I used to.

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:27.450
I can be this compassionate
woman.

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:32.090
I actually fired somebody
recently and it was a really

00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:35.700
sad conversation. and I took him
to coffee went and I was

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:37.850
talking about his business
and I put my arm around.

00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:40.120
I was like, let me help you.

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:42.780
I think this isn't the
right path for you.

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:46.810
But it was just having that
sort of compassionate

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:50.340
understanding and.

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:54.405
Just embracing the good
qualities that we have.

00:33:54.405 --> 00:33:57.500
DON DODGE: Do you think that
compassion and intuitive

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:01.070
nature helps in other parts
of the business

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:03.750
and building a company?

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:04.870
JENNIFER REUTING: Well, yeah.

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:09.690
I think that emotional
intelligence is huge, right?

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:10.370
It's funny.

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:14.699
I'm super getting into
poker lately.

00:34:14.699 --> 00:34:16.480
I'm just killing it
lately at poker.

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:19.770
It seems like there's this tie
between my business and my

00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:21.510
poker game.

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:27.170
And to me, it's sort of a
metaphor for business.

00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:34.699
It's not so much about the cards
that you're dealt, it's

00:34:34.699 --> 00:34:36.920
your intuitive understanding
of what's happening at the

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.110
table, your intuitive
understanding of all the

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:40.560
pieces, and all the components,

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.389
and the other players.

00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:47.650
And I think that having that
sort of compassion and

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:52.679
intuition, it also helps
with building culture.

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:54.330
Because you can sort
of tap in.

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:56.480
When things aren't right,
you know it.

00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:00.500
If things aren't right at your
company and the culture's off,

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:01.930
even if people--

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:05.370
As a CEO, people tend to hide
a lot of stuff from you.

00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:05.810
They do.

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:08.660
And they put on the happy face
and they'll say, oh,

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:10.820
everything's great.

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:12.950
But it's like poker.

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:14.410
They put on their poker faces.

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:17.500
And then you have to sort of
feel, OK, there's something

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.720
that's not right here.

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:20.830
What's really going on?

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:24.300
Let's get to the root of this.

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:27.790
So I think it helps with
company culture.

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:32.870
I think it helps with
in negotiations.

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:37.930
If you are a naturally
empathetic person and

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:43.770
compassionate person, I never
have a problem negotiating.

00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:47.910
Because to me, it's a
win-win situation.

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:50.240
If it was anything but a win-win
situation, I wouldn't

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.490
be happy with myself.

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:55.710
So by tapping into what is
beneficial for the other

00:35:55.710 --> 00:36:02.220
person involved in the
arrangement and getting a feel

00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:04.700
for what their needs are,
that's kind of what

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:07.370
compassion--

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:07.700
Yeah.

00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:13.222
So I think that ultimately
that's pretty beneficial.

00:36:13.222 --> 00:36:15.270
DON DODGE: So you've certainly
been a successful

00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:15.930
entrepreneur.

00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:17.850
This is your third company.

00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:22.822
Why do you think there aren't
more women entrepreneurs?

00:36:22.822 --> 00:36:26.400
JENNIFER REUTING:
I think that--

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.260
and this isn't universal.

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:32.200
All this stuff, it's pretty
controversial because people

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:35.200
tend to say like, oh,
I'm not like that,

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.720
and so it's all wrong.

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:42.750
But honestly, I believe that
it has to do with limiting

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:47.740
beliefs about yourself.

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:52.420
I feel really lucky that I grew
up with a dad and around

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:55.920
brothers and I was never
treated like a girl.

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:58.460
I was kind of tomboy.

00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:00.670
And I never had any
limiting beliefs.

00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:03.550
But when you're a girl
in a typical

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:05.100
family, you're coddled.

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:06.570
Right?

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:08.670
You have a 16-year-old son,
you're going to let him stay

00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:09.560
out past midnight.

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:10.860
You have a 16-year-old
girl, you'd better

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:11.650
call me as soon as--

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:14.815
Who are you out with?

00:37:14.815 --> 00:37:19.820
And so when you treat girls
differently in that way it's

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:22.860
natural, because we want
to protect women.

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:24.550
That's how society is.

00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:31.500
But it causes some limiting
beliefs seen.

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:33.510
I'm sure that has some
psychological effect.

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:36.560
Well, am I not as capable?

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:40.750
Am I more of a victim
in this world?

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:45.290
And that sort of permeates
throughout life unless they're

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:51.480
able to sort of address it
and say, OK, that doesn't

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:53.990
necessarily apply to business.

00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:58.040
I think it's also
facing fears.

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:02.980
I feel like women have to
actively get over some of

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:04.240
those limiting beliefs.

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:08.470
A lot of women that I know want
to start businesses, they

00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:11.060
want to do small things.

00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:14.000
They want to be independent
contractors.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.090
They want to do, I want
to have a publicity

00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:17.220
firm and be a publicist.

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:22.220
Or things that really involve
their own merits, as opposed

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:28.220
to, I want to disrupt that
space and be the market

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:33.180
leader, and I'm not going to
stop until I get there.

00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:34.860
And I don't hear that
a lot from women.

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:36.200
I hear that more from men.

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:39.270
And I think that whatever's
holding women back from

00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:41.450
feeling that they're able to
accomplish that and they're

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:48.740
able to go out and do a big, big
things, is probably where

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:51.944
we need to start.

00:38:51.944 --> 00:38:55.130
DON DODGE: Have you found that
your first company gave you

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:57.610
confidence and your second
company gave you more

00:38:57.610 --> 00:39:00.440
confidence and the third one?

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:02.740
Did that build on itself?

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:05.200
I have a sense that you were
pretty confident right from

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.840
the get-go, right
from the first--

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:07.400
JENNIFER REUTING: No.

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.840
I was fake confident.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:11.310
I was really fake confident.

00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:12.965
And I'm fake confident
all the time.

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:20.190
Ultimately, you just have
to fake it until

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:21.440
you make it, right?

00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:28.650
Facing fears is a big deal.

00:39:28.650 --> 00:39:31.100
So I try to do things that
challenge myself.

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:35.280
I have to be out of my comfort
zone as often as possible.

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:38.550
And I think that's the quality
over so many years that's a

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:42.260
really given me a self
confidence and just this

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:44.600
self-assuredness.

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:47.380
I know that no matter what
I'm going to be OK.

00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:53.290
Because I have travelled to
Russia and I was there by

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:57.800
myself in crazy situations on
trains with Russian police.

00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.460
And I got out of that one,
so this is nothing.

00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:07.060
So travelling by myself a lot
and just taking adventures,

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:11.420
and basically anything that I'm
afraid of, just biting the

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:13.190
bullet and doing it.

00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:17.140
Like I'm going to do jump out
of an airplane here in the

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:17.920
next couple weeks.

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:19.770
And I was just like, I'm
just booking it.

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:20.150
I'm not going to
think about it.

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:21.580
I'm just going to do it.

00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:23.700
Because you just got to get
it out of your system.

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:27.380
You can't have things
holding you back.

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:33.680
And doing that continuously over
years all of the sudden

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:35.940
your comfort zone just keeps
getting bigger and bigger and

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:37.790
bigger and bigger.

00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:45.120
And as you fail and then as you
overcome failing and have

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.060
a good cry over it--

00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:51.700
there's been some pretty
massive, horrible failures

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:55.820
from this fear from that
sort of mindset.

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:57.270
I get myself into
some situations

00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:59.470
that are just terrible.

00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:01.840
But then you come out of it,
and you're like, those are

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.090
always the best stories.

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:08.630
And then you know that
no matter what--

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:10.190
I was actually talking to
somebody about this the other

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:16.310
day, and it was actually in
relation to travelling by

00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:19.680
myself and just doing
crazy adventures--

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:23.000
I was like, sometimes things
don't work out and things are

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.170
really shitty.

00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:25.370
And it's like that
in business too--

00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:28.430
actually, it's really like
this in business also--

00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:31.360
and are really shitty and you
make a terrible mistake or

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:36.660
just a situation sucks, those
are always the stories.

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:38.650
Those are the stories that
you're talking about when

00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:40.890
you're at dinner with friends
and when you're like, yeah,

00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:42.840
you wouldn't believe when
this happened to me.

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:50.860
And so when I'm ever in the
middle of a shitty situation,

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:53.090
that's always going through my
mind that this is going to be

00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:53.830
a good story.

00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:56.490
And it puts things in
perspective that

00:41:56.490 --> 00:41:57.480
this is just temporary.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:59.710
This isn't like the
world is ending.

00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:02.020
This is going to be a really
good story one day.

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:04.680
DON DODGE: Well, you learn a lot
more from failure than you

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:06.510
do from success.

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:11.020
So if you can keep failure in
that frame of mind, that it's

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:14.830
really a learning experience,
and a month from now you'll be

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:18.695
smarter for it and you'll have
forgotten all the pain, then I

00:42:18.695 --> 00:42:19.530
guess that helps.

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:23.430
JENNIFER REUTING: It was
actually a big thing too, a

00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:27.530
journey I had to take, was being
able to separate success

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:29.460
from self worth.

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:35.260
Because I think that when your
value as a human beings starts

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:39.680
to depend on your success then
all of the sudden failure

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:42.830
takes on a whole new meaning.

00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:45.180
And then you become
afraid of failure.

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:48.440
So I think that people that are
too wrapped up in success,

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:53.440
that's sort of who they are and
that's their identity, it

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:54.910
actually hinders.

00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:56.790
And I'm speaking from
experience, because I went

00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:58.970
through a phase where I was
like, if I wasn't a

00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:04.690
successful, who am I.

00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:08.550
And I had to really learn how to
separate those two in order

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:10.430
to be able to fail.

00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:11.790
It's kind of funny.

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:14.520
And in order to be able to fail,
I could actually be more

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:15.100
successful.

00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:19.820
So to get to the next level of
success, I had to make success

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:24.080
mean less and learn how
to fail better.

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:25.340
DON DODGE: Amazing.

00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:30.540
Do you have any people that you
look up to or are inspired

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:33.160
by or that you ask advice for?

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:36.642
Or are you pretty much on your
own and do your own thing?

00:43:36.642 --> 00:43:37.730
JENNIFER REUTING: Yes.

00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:42.740
I have people everywhere,
actually.

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:47.260
I probably talk to a mentor in
one form or another a couple

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:48.830
times a week.

00:43:48.830 --> 00:43:53.410
Right now, I have a mentor
that's a CIO at a pretty big

00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:57.610
company that's just been really
amazing, helping me

00:43:57.610 --> 00:43:59.840
with some tech challenges
that I'm having.

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:04.110
And at the end of the day,
limiting yourself to your own

00:44:04.110 --> 00:44:07.280
knowledge it's just like such
a losing proposition.

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:12.560
Because there's just no way to
compete with somebody who has

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:14.810
access to other people's
knowledge in different

00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:19.520
industries, to the point where
if you have enough mentorship

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:23.120
I think you can probably
even do anything.

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:24.840
I think that that could even
substitute your own

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:27.190
experiences, as well.

00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:28.340
DON DODGE: Amazing.

00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:30.360
Well, Jennifer, thank you
for joining us today.

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:31.750
It's an amazing story.

00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:33.350
And good luck to you
in the future.

00:44:33.350 --> 00:44:35.130
JENNIFER REUTING: Well, thank
you for having me.

00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:36.380
DON DODGE: Thanks.
