00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.863
Judging from how complicated this looks
right now, they're probably going to be a

00:00:03.863 --> 00:00:07.821
lot of steps involved in simplifying this
expression. So, let's just get started.

00:00:07.821 --> 00:00:11.538
The first thing I'm going to do is use the
Distributive Property to distribute

00:00:11.538 --> 00:00:17.451
multiplication of -3x to every term inside
the parentheses. Remember that it doesn't

00:00:17.451 --> 00:00:20.813
matter how many terms are inside the
parentheses, we still multiply every

00:00:20.825 --> 00:00:25.008
single on of them. So, for now, that's the
only thing that I'm going to change. I'm

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.012
going to leave everything else, all the
other terms in the expression, exactly as

00:00:29.024 --> 00:00:32.723
they are. So now, we have this long
expanded expression. I'm really sorry. I

00:00:32.735 --> 00:00:37.354
had to erase your challenge warning sign,
but know that I still think this is a

00:00:37.354 --> 00:00:40.860
challenge problem. Now, we'll simplify it
within each term. You'll notice that I

00:00:40.872 --> 00:00:44.747
haven't switched any of these operator
signs to minus signs yet so I'll do that

00:00:44.747 --> 00:00:48.480
in this next step. So, wherever I'm adding
a negative term, I'm actually just

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.555
subtracting that term. So, instead of plus
-3xy, I'll actually just have -3xy. And

00:00:53.567 --> 00:00:58.170
now finally, we get to rearrange our terms
so that like terms are next to each other

00:00:58.182 --> 00:01:02.368
and simplify. And so, here's our final
answer. You still have six terms, which

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.656
just goes to show you sometimes, you can't
do anything more to make an expression

00:01:06.656 --> 00:01:10.164
look any prettier. But it definitely is a
bit less complicated than it was at the

00:01:10.176 --> 00:01:14.218
beginning. I know this was a really tough
problem and again, there were many, many

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.957
opportunities for little mistakes to be
made. So, if you got even part of this

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:22.186
right, especially practicing the
distributive property, that is awesome.

00:01:22.386 --> 00:01:24.781
So, if you made a little mistake, go back
and try it again. The Distributive

00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:28.587
Property will keep popping up at different
places throughout the course so it's super

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:31.992
important that you really, really
understand it. Although, probably not all

00:01:32.004 --> 00:01:34.871
the problems we do will be quite as
complicated as this one.
