00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:02.002
(audience applause)

00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:05.238
- Today's live challenge
is about cliff-hangers.

00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:08.241
(audience cheering)

00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:13.646
- Which...

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:19.319
(audience cheering)

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:33.867
If I hit you with this,

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:36.136
at least we'd know who it was.

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:38.004
(audience laughing)

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:39.272
- Soak it up.

00:00:39.272 --> 00:00:40.373
Just think about all the
things you're going to

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:41.775
have to follow next season.

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:44.010
(laughing)

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:46.813
- Didn't wanna hear that.

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:49.816
- It's only getting
worse from here.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.052
We're cutting to black in

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:54.421
the middle of the
episode next time.

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:58.491
(audience laughing and cheering)

00:01:01.428 --> 00:01:03.563 align:start size:94% position:6%
- As all Walking Dead fans
know, this past season

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:06.166
ended with a bit of
a shocking twist.

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.600
One that I won't give away

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.171 align:start size:97% position:3%
but it had a little something
to do with Lucille here.

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:14.941
(audience applause and cheering)

00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:18.845
Naturally, some fans handled
the pivotal cliff-hanger scene

00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:20.547
with grace and tact.

00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:22.048
(audience laughing)

00:01:22.048 --> 00:01:23.349
Like this reasonable tweet,

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:24.784
which was not uncommon.

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:26.753 align:start size:84% position:16%
"It wasn't chilling,
it was annoying.

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:28.855
"F**k you Chris Hardwick.

00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:31.825
F**k you "and your
giant Adam's apple."

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:34.828
(audience laughing)

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:39.499
(audience cheering)

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:40.934
- She seemed so nice otherwise.

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:42.302
- Otherwise.

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:43.536
"My giant Adam's apple?

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:45.171
"Don't bring little
Carl into this!"

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:46.706
That's what I call
my Adam's apple.

00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:48.641
Carl (growls)

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:50.143
Or this tweet -

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:51.678 align:start size:94% position:6%
"Been busy with
Wrestlemania but f**k AMC,

00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:53.246
"Scott Gimple for directing the

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:54.647
- he didn't direct it -

00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:55.915 align:start size:97% position:3%
"directing the cliff-hanger
for season finale

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:58.084
"and Robert Kirkman
for allowing it."

00:01:58.084 --> 00:02:00.854 align:start size:81% position:19%
F**k you! F**k you
Robert Kirkman,

00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:03.957 align:start size:97% position:3%
Wrestlemania would never
pull that cliff-hanger sh*t.

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:04.891
(audience cheering)

00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:07.460
Wrestlemania respects it's fans.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.596
(audience cheering)

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:11.764 align:start size:88% position:13%
People were upset,
they were hoping to see

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:14.467
who Negan killed,
we don't know yet;

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:16.202
but something tells me
the cliff-hanger rage

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:18.805
is not going away any time soon.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:21.641
So comedians, in a promo for
the next season of a show,

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:23.076
please give us a voiceover for

00:02:23.076 --> 00:02:24.978 align:start size:84% position:16%
the worst cliff-hanger
you can think of -

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:26.412
Robert Kirkman.

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:28.581 align:start size:97% position:3%
- On the next exciting
episode of the Walking Dead,

00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:31.384 align:start size:88% position:13%
we find out how mad
fans are when they learn

00:02:31.384 --> 00:02:35.522
Negan killed Carl in the
season 6 cliff-hanger.

00:02:35.522 --> 00:02:38.558
(audience cheering)

00:02:38.558 --> 00:02:39.726
- World Star!

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:44.597
- World Star!
- World Star!

00:02:44.597 --> 00:02:46.833
- World Star!
- World Star!

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:52.038
- People wanted to know!

00:02:53.873 --> 00:02:55.275
I'm not gonna make
you wait all summer,

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:57.143
I'm not an a**hole.

00:02:57.143 --> 00:02:59.579
