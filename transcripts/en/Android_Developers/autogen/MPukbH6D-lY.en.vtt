building applications for the Android

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049
building applications for the Android
 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.740
building applications for the Android
platform we found that it was useful to

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750
platform we found that it was useful to
 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.080
platform we found that it was useful to
have an always-on data connection so

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090
have an always-on data connection so
 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.399
have an always-on data connection so
that the server can send notifications

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409
that the server can send notifications
 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.300
that the server can send notifications
to the two devices running the Android

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310
to the two devices running the Android
 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.550
to the two devices running the Android
platform it turned out this is such a

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560
platform it turned out this is such a
 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.950
platform it turned out this is such a
useful piece of infrastructure that we

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960
useful piece of infrastructure that we
 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.390
useful piece of infrastructure that we
decided to package it up and make it

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400
decided to package it up and make it
 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.219
decided to package it up and make it
available as part of the public

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229
available as part of the public
 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.950
available as part of the public
framework and that has been done by

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960
framework and that has been done by
 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.789
framework and that has been done by
creating the XMPP service api's the XMPP

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799
creating the XMPP service api's the XMPP
 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.490
creating the XMPP service api's the XMPP
service allows any application to send

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500
service allows any application to send
 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.399
service allows any application to send
device to device data messages to any

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409
device to device data messages to any
 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.399
device to device data messages to any
user who's running Android on their

user who's running Android on their
 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.700
user who's running Android on their
device now that data can be whatever

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710
device now that data can be whatever
 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.170
device now that data can be whatever
information makes sense for the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180
information makes sense for the

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060
application so for a multiplayer game
 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.449
application so for a multiplayer game
that might be that I've moved my knight

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459
that might be that I've moved my knight
 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.699
that might be that I've moved my knight
to a particular location or whatever

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709
to a particular location or whatever
 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.470
to a particular location or whatever
makes sense for the game but it could

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480
makes sense for the game but it could
 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.020
makes sense for the game but it could
also be something else

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030
also be something else
 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.570
also be something else
geographic information so with

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580
geographic information so with
 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.690
geographic information so with
appropriate permissions and security the

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700
appropriate permissions and security the
 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.140
appropriate permissions and security the
user could send their location to their

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150
user could send their location to their
 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.730
user could send their location to their
buddies so that their buddies could

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740
buddies so that their buddies could
 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.440
buddies so that their buddies could
actually see where they are at any given

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450
actually see where they are at any given
 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.720
actually see where they are at any given
time and plot that information on a map

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730
time and plot that information on a map
 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.030
time and plot that information on a map
again this works with any gmail account

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040
again this works with any gmail account
 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.060
again this works with any gmail account
so any application can send this type of

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070
so any application can send this type of
 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.490
so any application can send this type of
peer-to-peer messages without having to

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500
peer-to-peer messages without having to
 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.860
peer-to-peer messages without having to
build any server infrastructure the next

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870
build any server infrastructure the next
 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.110
build any server infrastructure the next
API is one of my favorites it's called

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120
API is one of my favorites it's called
 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.510
API is one of my favorites it's called
the notification manager and it allows

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520
the notification manager and it allows
 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.640
the notification manager and it allows
any application to put a notification

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650
any application to put a notification
 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.520
any application to put a notification
into the status bar we use the status

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530
into the status bar we use the status
 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.730
into the status bar we use the status
bar for things like SMS notifications

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740
bar for things like SMS notifications
 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.800
bar for things like SMS notifications
voicemail notifications all of the

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810
voicemail notifications all of the
 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.390
voicemail notifications all of the
typical things you'd expect to see on a

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400
typical things you'd expect to see on a
 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.400
typical things you'd expect to see on a
phone however we make that same facility

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410
phone however we make that same facility
 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.210
phone however we make that same facility
available to any application and so that

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220
available to any application and so that
 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.160
available to any application and so that
means that developers can have the same

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170
means that developers can have the same
 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.620
means that developers can have the same
power to alert the user to interesting

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630
power to alert the user to interesting

built in applications this has a lot of

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040
built in applications this has a lot of
 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.490
built in applications this has a lot of
benefits first it means that all

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500
benefits first it means that all
 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.200
benefits first it means that all
notifications have a consistent

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210
notifications have a consistent
 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.720
notifications have a consistent
presentation now the way we do it in the

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730
presentation now the way we do it in the
 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.080
presentation now the way we do it in the
UI we have a visible preview of what the

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090
UI we have a visible preview of what the
 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.930
UI we have a visible preview of what the
notification means so if an icon appears

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940
notification means so if an icon appears
 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.050
notification means so if an icon appears
in the status bar you can click on it or

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060
in the status bar you can click on it or
 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.210
in the status bar you can click on it or
touch it to make it active so you can

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220
touch it to make it active so you can
 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.560
touch it to make it active so you can
see a preview of what it means which

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570
see a preview of what it means which
 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:30.940
see a preview of what it means which
means you don't have to figure out what

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950
means you don't have to figure out what
 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.070
means you don't have to figure out what
each of 30 different hieroglyphics means

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.890
notification you can simply touch on it
and you will be taken to whatever

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900
and you will be taken to whatever
 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.690
and you will be taken to whatever
application is responsible for that

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700
application is responsible for that
 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.270
application is responsible for that
notification this allows a lot of really

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280
notification this allows a lot of really
 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.400
notification this allows a lot of really
interesting scenarios it means that

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410
interesting scenarios it means that
 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.080
interesting scenarios it means that
applications can notify you of things

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090
applications can notify you of things
 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.630
applications can notify you of things
like when an auction is ending or if

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640
like when an auction is ending or if
 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.010
like when an auction is ending or if
someone has invited you to be their

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020
someone has invited you to be their
 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.260
someone has invited you to be their
friend on a social network or if a bus

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270
friend on a social network or if a bus
 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.510
friend on a social network or if a bus
is coming and all of those notifications

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520
is coming and all of those notifications
 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.640
is coming and all of those notifications
can have the same level of prominence in

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650
can have the same level of prominence in
 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.270
can have the same level of prominence in
the UI as something like voicemail or

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280
the UI as something like voicemail or
 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.270
the UI as something like voicemail or
the other built-in notifications and

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280
the other built-in notifications and
 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.290
the other built-in notifications and
finally I'd like to take a minute to

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300
finally I'd like to take a minute to
 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.090
finally I'd like to take a minute to
talk about the view system in Android

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100
talk about the view system in Android
 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.610
talk about the view system in Android
Android provides a really rich toolkit

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620
Android provides a really rich toolkit
 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.949
Android provides a really rich toolkit
of built-in views and you can use those

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959
of built-in views and you can use those
 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.050
of built-in views and you can use those
to assemble your applications out of

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060
to assemble your applications out of
 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.120
to assemble your applications out of
standard parts so we provide things like

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130
standard parts so we provide things like
 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.449
standard parts so we provide things like
a ListView and a grid view a gallery

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459
a ListView and a grid view a gallery
 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.680
a ListView and a grid view a gallery
view we provide all the standard widgets

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690
view we provide all the standard widgets
 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.960
view we provide all the standard widgets
like buttons and check boxes and by

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970
like buttons and check boxes and by
 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.100
like buttons and check boxes and by
combining those things you can build

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110
combining those things you can build
 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.730
combining those things you can build
your application

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740
your application
 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.999
your application
really quickly we've also done a lot of

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:31.009
really quickly we've also done a lot of
 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:32.499
really quickly we've also done a lot of
work in the framework to support

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:32.509
work in the framework to support
 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:34.870
work in the framework to support
multiple input methods and multiple

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880
multiple input methods and multiple
 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.999
multiple input methods and multiple
screen sizes and multiple keyboard

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:37.009
screen sizes and multiple keyboard
 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:39.159
screen sizes and multiple keyboard
configurations in the view system itself

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169
configurations in the view system itself
 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:40.629
configurations in the view system itself
so that you don't have to worry about

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639
so that you don't have to worry about
 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.879
so that you don't have to worry about
that in your application so for example

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889
that in your application so for example
 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.969
that in your application so for example
our list views work with touch but they

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979
our list views work with touch but they
 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:48.100
our list views work with touch but they
also work if you want to drive them with

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110
also work if you want to drive them with
 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.900
also work if you want to drive them with
a five-way d-pad and that's just a

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910
a five-way d-pad and that's just a
 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.580
a five-way d-pad and that's just a
built-in facility of the view framework

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590
built-in facility of the view framework
 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.950
built-in facility of the view framework
in addition to that sort of views

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960
in addition to that sort of views
 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.460
in addition to that sort of views
we also are introducing two really

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470
we also are introducing two really
 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.360
we also are introducing two really
innovative views the first is a map view

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370
innovative views the first is a map view
 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.999
innovative views the first is a map view
this is an actual this is an

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:04.009
this is an actual this is an
 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:06.760
this is an actual this is an
implementation of the same map rendering

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770
implementation of the same map rendering
 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.010
implementation of the same map rendering
engine that's in our Maps application

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020
engine that's in our Maps application
 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.260
engine that's in our Maps application
but we decided to make that available as

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270
but we decided to make that available as
 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.540
but we decided to make that available as
a view so that applications can have

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550
a view so that applications can have
 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.939
a view so that applications can have
really tight really tight integration

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:15.949
really tight really tight integration
 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:18.969
really tight really tight integration
with geographic data so it's of course

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979
with geographic data so it's of course
 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:20.620
with geographic data so it's of course
possible to always launch the map

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630
possible to always launch the map
 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.180
possible to always launch the map
application to display a particular

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190
application to display a particular
 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.460
application to display a particular
location but what the maps view let you

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470
location but what the maps view let you
 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.830
location but what the maps view let you
do is actually embed a map view in your

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840
do is actually embed a map view in your
 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.749
do is actually embed a map view in your
application so that you can control it

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:28.759
application so that you can control it
 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:30.760
application so that you can control it
from your own code so you can set it to

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770
from your own code so you can set it to
 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.560
from your own code so you can set it to
a particular location zoom in zoom out

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570
a particular location zoom in zoom out
 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.600
a particular location zoom in zoom out
pan the map control all of that from

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610
pan the map control all of that from
 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.790
pan the map control all of that from
your own code to build whatever kind of

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800
your own code to build whatever kind of
 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.620
your own code to build whatever kind of
application you want to build based on

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630
application you want to build based on
 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.050
application you want to build based on
that we've done something similar with

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060
that we've done something similar with
 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.820
that we've done something similar with

application that you can launch to
 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:47.290
application that you can launch to
display a web page but we also have a

what I'm hoping to see come out of the

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300
what I'm hoping to see come out of the
 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.390
what I'm hoping to see come out of the
Android effort is the kind of innovation

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400
Android effort is the kind of innovation
 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.490
Android effort is the kind of innovation
that comes from what I call the mashup

that comes from what I call the mashup
 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.189
that comes from what I call the mashup
effect we really had two goals in mind

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:06.199
effect we really had two goals in mind
 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.110
effect we really had two goals in mind
when we set out to create Android the

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120
when we set out to create Android the
 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.089
when we set out to create Android the
first was to provide developers with a

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:10.099
first was to provide developers with a
 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:12.490
first was to provide developers with a
