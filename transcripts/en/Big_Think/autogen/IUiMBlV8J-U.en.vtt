music so for me it's just a bit up in a

00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:54.789
music so for me it's just a bit up in a
 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:59.669
music so for me it's just a bit up in a
way I feel like it's it's my like now as

00:00:59.669 --> 00:00:59.679
way I feel like it's it's my like now as
 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:03.450

I'm struggling to find words to express

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460
I'm struggling to find words to express
 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.280
I'm struggling to find words to express
myself when I play music I feel like

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290
myself when I play music I feel like
 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.950
myself when I play music I feel like
that's where my real voice is or that's

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960
that's where my real voice is or that's
 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.380
that's where my real voice is or that's
where I really say something more than

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390
where I really say something more than
 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.340
where I really say something more than
with words I mean words are words are

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350
with words I mean words are words are
 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:25.580
with words I mean words are words are
cool too but I'm not that good

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590
 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.330
I think if there's a natural way I have

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340
I think if there's a natural way I have
 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.830
I think if there's a natural way I have
a speaking I hesitate and I think and I

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840
a speaking I hesitate and I think and I
 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.430
a speaking I hesitate and I think and I
it takes me a while to get the thoughts

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440
it takes me a while to get the thoughts
 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.950
it takes me a while to get the thoughts
formed in my mind and to get them to

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960
formed in my mind and to get them to
 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.320
formed in my mind and to get them to
come out and the same thing happens when

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330
come out and the same thing happens when
 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.600
come out and the same thing happens when
I'm playing music there's I'm thinking

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610
I'm playing music there's I'm thinking
 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.810
I'm playing music there's I'm thinking
and there's I'll hesitate or all so

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820
and there's I'll hesitate or all so
 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.730
and there's I'll hesitate or all so
there's a natural rhythm that I have

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740
there's a natural rhythm that I have
 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.359
there's a natural rhythm that I have
that happens when I play but then also I

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369
that happens when I play but then also I
 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.150
that happens when I play but then also I
mean you can't just the the silence is

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160
mean you can't just the the silence is
 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.990
mean you can't just the the silence is
as important as the you know there's

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000
as important as the you know there's
 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.600
as important as the you know there's
dark and light and you can't see one or

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610
dark and light and you can't see one or
 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.660
dark and light and you can't see one or
the other if you know they cancel each

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670
the other if you know they cancel each
 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.759
the other if you know they cancel each
other out so I mean if there's sound

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769
other out so I mean if there's sound
 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.830
other out so I mean if there's sound
there has to be no sound to go with it

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840
there has to be no sound to go with it
 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.759
there has to be no sound to go with it
before it'll mean anything I think

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769
 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.030
I guess I don't really think so much

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040
I guess I don't really think so much
 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.390
I guess I don't really think so much
about what it's called although it's

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400
about what it's called although it's
 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.960
about what it's called although it's
just music or but there was a time when

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970
just music or but there was a time when
 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.880
just music or but there was a time when
I shied away from calling myself a jazz

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890
I shied away from calling myself a jazz
 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.250
I shied away from calling myself a jazz
musician but or maybe it was because I

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260
musician but or maybe it was because I
 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.240
musician but or maybe it was because I
don't like to be boxed in somehow but

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250
don't like to be boxed in somehow but
 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.830
don't like to be boxed in somehow but
but these days I for me

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840
but these days I for me
 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.430
but these days I for me
jazz it when I started to find out about

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440
jazz it when I started to find out about
 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:05.140
jazz it when I started to find out about
jazz music for me that it that was a

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150
jazz music for me that it that was a
 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:12.610
jazz music for me that it that was a
place where anything was possible the

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620
place where anything was possible the
 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.580
place where anything was possible the
people that I listened to when I started

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590
people that I listened to when I started
 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.129
people that I listened to when I started
to hear Sonny Rollins and Thelonious

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:18.139
to hear Sonny Rollins and Thelonious
 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:20.830
to hear Sonny Rollins and Thelonious
Monk and Charlie Parker and there was

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840
Monk and Charlie Parker and there was
 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.479
Monk and Charlie Parker and there was
something that those guys were doing

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489
something that those guys were doing
 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:28.000
something that those guys were doing
that it seemed to include it what it

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010
that it seemed to include it what it
 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.099
that it seemed to include it what it
wasn't exclusive I don't know if I don't

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109
wasn't exclusive I don't know if I don't
 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:31.960
wasn't exclusive I don't know if I don't
think they were thinking about the name

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970
think they were thinking about the name
 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.680
think they were thinking about the name
you know dude gallant in ER but there

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690
you know dude gallant in ER but there
 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:42.069
you know dude gallant in ER but there
was something in their music that it

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079
was something in their music that it
 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.520
was something in their music that it
wasn't exclusive it included everything

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530
wasn't exclusive it included everything
 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.509
wasn't exclusive it included everything
that they knew there that all of their

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519
that they knew there that all of their
 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:55.059
that they knew there that all of their
experience and in that way I still think

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069
experience and in that way I still think
 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.599
experience and in that way I still think
of myself as a just I mean it's just I

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609
of myself as a just I mean it's just I
 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:00.550
of myself as a just I mean it's just I
take what I know or where I've been and

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560
take what I know or where I've been and
 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:07.119
take what I know or where I've been and
just try to make something out of it and

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:07.129
just try to make something out of it and
 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:10.149
just try to make something out of it and
and that's what I think jazz to me means

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:10.159
and that's what I think jazz to me means
 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:12.189
and that's what I think jazz to me means
so I don't mind being called a jazz

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:12.199
so I don't mind being called a jazz
 

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:15.670
so I don't mind being called a jazz
musician

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680
 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:23.770
I'm not sure the it's the improvisation

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780
I'm not sure the it's the improvisation
 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.460
I'm not sure the it's the improvisation
and the composition it's also it's

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470
and the composition it's also it's
 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:35.860
and the composition it's also it's
getting more and more it's it's harder

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870
getting more and more it's it's harder
 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.749
getting more and more it's it's harder
to separate the two I mean sometimes I

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:40.759
to separate the two I mean sometimes I
 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:43.990
to separate the two I mean sometimes I
used to say that when I would write like

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000
used to say that when I would write like
 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.499
used to say that when I would write like
when I write music it's sort of a slowed

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:47.509
when I write music it's sort of a slowed
 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:50.350
when I write music it's sort of a slowed
down version of when I improvise or

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360
down version of when I improvise or
 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.159
down version of when I improvise or
something it's it's like you have more

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169
something it's it's like you have more
 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:05:02.080
something it's it's like you have more
time to be critical or block yourself

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090
time to be critical or block yourself
 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.170
time to be critical or block yourself
you know you're and when you're

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180
you know you're and when you're
 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.790
you know you're and when you're
improvising you have to just deal with

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800
improvising you have to just deal with
 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.570
improvising you have to just deal with
the moment and but I think I'm the two

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580
the moment and but I think I'm the two
 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:17.010
the moment and but I think I'm the two
things are getting closer together where

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020
 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.620
when I'm writing music on paper it's I'm

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630
when I'm writing music on paper it's I'm
 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.460
when I'm writing music on paper it's I'm
able to maybe not judge it so much in

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470
able to maybe not judge it so much in
 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.710
able to maybe not judge it so much in
the moment and just let it let it come

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720
the moment and just let it let it come
 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.800
the moment and just let it let it come
out and and then at the same time when

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810
out and and then at the same time when
 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.089
out and and then at the same time when
I'm improvising spontaneously I'm I'm

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.099
I'm improvising spontaneously I'm I'm
 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:40.570
I'm improvising spontaneously I'm I'm
getting closer to having it be maybe the

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580
getting closer to having it be maybe the
 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.999
getting closer to having it be maybe the
structure of it being more solid or

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:46.009
structure of it being more solid or
 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:47.790
structure of it being more solid or
something I don't know

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800
something I don't know
 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:54.460
something I don't know
and I mean even if I play the same same

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470
and I mean even if I play the same same
 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.689
and I mean even if I play the same same
notes or the same song or and with the

00:05:58.689 --> 00:05:58.699
notes or the same song or and with the
 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:00.760
notes or the same song or and with the
there's so many things that are

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770
there's so many things that are
 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.399
there's so many things that are
happening with the the people that I'm

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:03.409
happening with the the people that I'm
 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:07.270
happening with the the people that I'm
with playing and the the sound of the

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280
with playing and the the sound of the
 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.760
with playing and the the sound of the
room and the audience and the

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770
room and the audience and the
 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.899
room and the audience and the
temperature and whatever other noises

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:13.909
temperature and whatever other noises
 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:18.120
temperature and whatever other noises
going on or what happened that day or

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130
going on or what happened that day or
 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.529
going on or what happened that day or
there's no way you can play the same

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:20.539
there's no way you can play the same
 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:24.640
there's no way you can play the same
thing twice even if you're trying to I

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650
thing twice even if you're trying to I
 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.459
thing twice even if you're trying to I
mean I'm trying to actually not play it

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:27.469
mean I'm trying to actually not play it
 

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:32.530
mean I'm trying to actually not play it
the same way twice I guess but

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:32.540
 

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.730
so I mean in that way even playing a set

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740
so I mean in that way even playing a set
 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.520
so I mean in that way even playing a set
piece for me it doesn't feel that much

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:40.530
piece for me it doesn't feel that much
 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:41.779
piece for me it doesn't feel that much
different than something that's

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:41.789
different than something that's
 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:48.139
different than something that's
improvised

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:48.149
 

00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:50.519
it used to be seemed like it would be

00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:50.529
it used to be seemed like it would be
 

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:52.139
it used to be seemed like it would be
easier for me to do it when I was

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:52.149
easier for me to do it when I was
 

00:06:52.149 --> 00:06:56.189
easier for me to do it when I was
traveling or anywhere I would just write

00:06:56.189 --> 00:06:56.199
traveling or anywhere I would just write
 

00:06:56.199 --> 00:07:01.519
traveling or anywhere I would just write
stuff down and but now I need more

00:07:01.519 --> 00:07:01.529
stuff down and but now I need more
 

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:11.129
stuff down and but now I need more
solitary concentrated time and I'll I'll

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:11.139
solitary concentrated time and I'll I'll
 

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:14.459
solitary concentrated time and I'll I'll
write a lot like I actually had a little

00:07:14.459 --> 00:07:14.469
write a lot like I actually had a little
 

00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:16.769
write a lot like I actually had a little
bit of time off recently where I just

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:16.779
bit of time off recently where I just
 

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:20.279
bit of time off recently where I just
wrote music every day without I didn't

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:20.289
wrote music every day without I didn't
 

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:24.139
wrote music every day without I didn't
have any deadlines or it wasn't for any

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:24.149
have any deadlines or it wasn't for any
 

00:07:24.149 --> 00:07:27.419
have any deadlines or it wasn't for any
reason other than just doing it and then

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:27.429
reason other than just doing it and then
 

00:07:27.429 --> 00:07:29.790
reason other than just doing it and then
I was able to get into a real rhythm of

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:29.800
I was able to get into a real rhythm of
 

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:35.399
I was able to get into a real rhythm of
it's it's almost like I don't know what

00:07:35.399 --> 00:07:35.409
it's it's almost like I don't know what
 

00:07:35.409 --> 00:07:38.509
it's it's almost like I don't know what
I seems for me it works best if I don't

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:38.519
I seems for me it works best if I don't
 

00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:43.259
I seems for me it works best if I don't
judge what I'm doing as I'm doing it or

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:43.269
judge what I'm doing as I'm doing it or
 

00:07:43.269 --> 00:07:45.509
judge what I'm doing as I'm doing it or
every time I start to think about what

00:07:45.509 --> 00:07:45.519
every time I start to think about what
 

00:07:45.519 --> 00:07:47.909
every time I start to think about what
it actually is then I become too

00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:47.919
it actually is then I become too
 

00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:50.399
it actually is then I become too
critical and it just stops the process

00:07:50.399 --> 00:07:50.409
critical and it just stops the process
 

00:07:50.409 --> 00:07:54.540
critical and it just stops the process
so I have to just it's like just I sort

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:54.550
so I have to just it's like just I sort
 

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.869
so I have to just it's like just I sort
of get into a the energy of it and the

00:07:57.869 --> 00:07:57.879
of get into a the energy of it and the
 

00:07:57.879 --> 00:08:00.899
of get into a the energy of it and the
stuff just comes out and pages and pages

00:08:00.899 --> 00:08:00.909
stuff just comes out and pages and pages
 

00:08:00.909 --> 00:08:04.049
stuff just comes out and pages and pages
of this stuff I filled up a few

00:08:04.049 --> 00:08:04.059
of this stuff I filled up a few
 

00:08:04.059 --> 00:08:10.279
of this stuff I filled up a few
notebooks with music over a few weeks

00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:10.289
notebooks with music over a few weeks
 

00:08:10.289 --> 00:08:14.369
notebooks with music over a few weeks
recently and then the process then I go

00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:14.379
recently and then the process then I go
 

00:08:14.379 --> 00:08:17.369
recently and then the process then I go
back and I start looking at it more

00:08:17.369 --> 00:08:17.379
back and I start looking at it more
 

00:08:17.379 --> 00:08:20.069
back and I start looking at it more
critically and sometimes there's

00:08:20.069 --> 00:08:20.079
critically and sometimes there's
 

00:08:20.079 --> 00:08:22.589
critically and sometimes there's
fully-formed things there or there's

00:08:22.589 --> 00:08:22.599
fully-formed things there or there's
 

00:08:22.599 --> 00:08:26.600
fully-formed things there or there's
just germs of things that can become

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:26.610
just germs of things that can become
 

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:31.199
just germs of things that can become
something bigger and then I'll bring it

00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:31.209
something bigger and then I'll bring it
 

00:08:31.209 --> 00:08:36.990
something bigger and then I'll bring it
I've been so lucky with I'm just so

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:37.000
I've been so lucky with I'm just so
 

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.850
I've been so lucky with I'm just so
fortunate with the people that I play

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:38.860
fortunate with the people that I play
 

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:45.090
fortunate with the people that I play
with over the last I don't know well

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:45.100
with over the last I don't know well
 

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.740
with over the last I don't know well
since I started trying to do my own

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:46.750
since I started trying to do my own
 

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:50.400
since I started trying to do my own
music I've been I feel really lucky that

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:50.410
music I've been I feel really lucky that
 

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:54.840
music I've been I feel really lucky that
I've been around people that have backed

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:54.850
I've been around people that have backed
 

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:57.030
I've been around people that have backed
me up

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:57.040
me up
 

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:01.180
me up
encouraged me and so much of what I

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:01.190
encouraged me and so much of what I
 

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:05.590
encouraged me and so much of what I
write it almost doesn't feel it so much

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:05.600
write it almost doesn't feel it so much
 

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.750
write it almost doesn't feel it so much
of it comes from the people I'm with

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:07.760
of it comes from the people I'm with
 

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:12.840
of it comes from the people I'm with
when I bring them a melody and they put

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:12.850
when I bring them a melody and they put
 

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:17.110
when I bring them a melody and they put
stuff into it that I could never you

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:17.120
stuff into it that I could never you
 

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:22.120
stuff into it that I could never you
can't really write it down so with the

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:22.130
can't really write it down so with the
 

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.000
can't really write it down so with the
different groups I have I usually

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:24.010
different groups I have I usually
 

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:29.710
different groups I have I usually
present them with some kind of structure

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:29.720
present them with some kind of structure
 

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:35.470
present them with some kind of structure
like just maybe it's just one melody or

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:35.480
like just maybe it's just one melody or
 

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:40.810
like just maybe it's just one melody or
maybe it's a more fully formed four-part

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:40.820
maybe it's a more fully formed four-part
 

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:44.650
maybe it's a more fully formed four-part
thing or something but there's a point

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:44.660
thing or something but there's a point
 

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.630
thing or something but there's a point
where I just kind of leave it up to them

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:46.640
where I just kind of leave it up to them
 

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:51.210
where I just kind of leave it up to them
to do with it what they want and that's

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:51.220
to do with it what they want and that's
 

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:55.510
to do with it what they want and that's
really exciting for me is it it's not

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:55.520
really exciting for me is it it's not
 

00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:00.790
really exciting for me is it it's not
like just writing music and bringing it

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:00.800
like just writing music and bringing it
 

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.730
like just writing music and bringing it
to some anonymous people and just having

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:03.740
to some anonymous people and just having
 

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.240
to some anonymous people and just having
them play exactly what's there it's

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:06.250
them play exactly what's there it's
 

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:13.100
them play exactly what's there it's
there's more going on than that

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:13.110
 

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.560
when I start listening to Miles Davis

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:15.570
when I start listening to Miles Davis
 

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:19.519
when I start listening to Miles Davis
playing the trumpet or or Bill Evans

00:10:19.519 --> 00:10:19.529
playing the trumpet or or Bill Evans
 

00:10:19.529 --> 00:10:23.660
playing the trumpet or or Bill Evans
playing the piano like I'd hear the

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:23.670
playing the piano like I'd hear the
 

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:26.329
playing the piano like I'd hear the
piano I think oh he's you know they can

00:10:26.329 --> 00:10:26.339
piano I think oh he's you know they can
 

00:10:26.339 --> 00:10:30.860
piano I think oh he's you know they can
play notes in one hand and the notes

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:30.870
play notes in one hand and the notes
 

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:32.540
play notes in one hand and the notes
just ring out and then they can play

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:32.550
just ring out and then they can play
 

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:37.930
just ring out and then they can play
other notes and so that led me to get a

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:37.940
other notes and so that led me to get a
 

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:42.139
other notes and so that led me to get a
delay pedal where I could play something

00:10:42.139 --> 00:10:42.149
delay pedal where I could play something
 

00:10:42.149 --> 00:10:44.030
delay pedal where I could play something
and then the notes would keep going and

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.040
and then the notes would keep going and
 

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.440
and then the notes would keep going and
then I could play some other stuff I

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:45.450
then I could play some other stuff I
 

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:47.300
then I could play some other stuff I
mean it that came from really from

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:47.310
mean it that came from really from
 

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:51.639
mean it that came from really from
thinking about piano and or or even a

00:10:51.639 --> 00:10:51.649
thinking about piano and or or even a
 

00:10:51.649 --> 00:10:53.240
thinking about piano and or or even a
distortion

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:53.250
distortion
 

00:10:53.250 --> 00:11:00.470
distortion
I remember hearing I was hearing like

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480
I remember hearing I was hearing like
 

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.389
I remember hearing I was hearing like
Miles Davis playing a trumpet and then I

00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399
Miles Davis playing a trumpet and then I
 

00:11:02.399 --> 00:11:06.380
Miles Davis playing a trumpet and then I
heard Carlos Santana playing the guitar

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:06.390
heard Carlos Santana playing the guitar
 

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:11.000
heard Carlos Santana playing the guitar
and he had this really you know he was

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:11.010
and he had this really you know he was
 

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:15.019
and he had this really you know he was
pushing the amp way past what was the

00:11:15.019 --> 00:11:15.029
pushing the amp way past what was the
 

00:11:15.029 --> 00:11:18.610
pushing the amp way past what was the
normal or what was you know he was

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:18.620
normal or what was you know he was
 

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:22.819
normal or what was you know he was
really getting this distorted long or

00:11:22.819 --> 00:11:22.829
really getting this distorted long or
 

00:11:22.829 --> 00:11:27.410
really getting this distorted long or
Jimi Hendrix did that but I started to

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:27.420
Jimi Hendrix did that but I started to
 

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.910
Jimi Hendrix did that but I started to
hear wait a minute that sounds kind of

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:28.920
hear wait a minute that sounds kind of
 

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.939
hear wait a minute that sounds kind of
like the trumpet and so then I got a

00:11:31.939 --> 00:11:31.949
like the trumpet and so then I got a
 

00:11:31.949 --> 00:11:33.920
like the trumpet and so then I got a
distortion thing I said so I mean it

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:33.930
distortion thing I said so I mean it
 

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:38.870
distortion thing I said so I mean it
kind of came almost more from trying to

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880
kind of came almost more from trying to
 

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:43.870
kind of came almost more from trying to
