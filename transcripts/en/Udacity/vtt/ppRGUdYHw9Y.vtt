00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It's going to turn out that balanced parentheses are one of the first things we've seen

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that are too complicated to be captured accurately by our old, dearest friend,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the regular expressions.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We're going to need something like a context-free grammar to do it.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Here I've written a grammar for balanced parentheses,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and over here to the right, I've tried to write a regular expression

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that catches the same sort of thing--

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
an open parenthesis possibly repeated and a closed parenthesis possibly repeated.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Remember that these slashes are escape sequences to say, oh,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I really mean the open parentheses, and I don't really mean some sort of grouping.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
However, it's going to turn out that the best-laid plans don't quite work out.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
My regular expression is a be too permissive,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and there are going to be some strings that it accepts

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
but the grammar does not--

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
some strings that it accepts that aren't really balanced parentheses.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
In this multiple multiple choice quiz, I'd like you to tell me

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
for these five strings, for these five utterances,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
which ones are in "r," the regular expression,

00:01:08.000 --> 09:59:59.000
but not in "P", the grammar for parentheses. Think about it.
