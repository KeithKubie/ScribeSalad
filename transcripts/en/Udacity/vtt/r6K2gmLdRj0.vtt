00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We know that a mass of 1 kg experiences

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
a rate force of about 10 Newtons on the surface of the earth,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
but for space travel, we need to know more.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
What's going to happen if it double the distance

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
between our mass and the center of the earth?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
For instance, what's going to happen if we double

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the distance between our mass at the center of the earth?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Obviously, the force is shrinking,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
but by which factor?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It turns out that as we double the distance,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
we have only one quarter of the force.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
If we tripled the distance, the

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
force goes down to 1/9, which means

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
that in our creation for the force of gravity,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
we have to have a distance squared in the denominator.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
If we use twice the mass,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
we should have twice the force,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
so the mass appears in the numerator.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And if all masses are created equal, the

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
mass of the earth should have the same role,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
so the mass of the earth, too, should appear in the numerator.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
&gt;From the units of measurement, you can see

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
that this doesn't work out so far -- kg²/m²

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
That doesn't look like force--

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
this universal constant appearing in front--

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
the constant of gravity, which is 6.67 * 10⁻¹¹,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
N m²/kg².

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
These units are pretty much of human scale--

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Newtons, meters, kilograms--and you see that

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
gravity seems to be pretty small on these scales.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
The force exerted by 2 masses of 1 kg each

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
in a distance of 1 m

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
would amount to 6.67 * 10⁻¹¹ Newtons--

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
a pretty small force.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
This is why we need something as big as a planet to see gravity in action.
