00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:01.790
STEVE MOULD: This is
Benford's Law.

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.410
And it's about numbers, but it's
about the leading digit.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.540
For example, you could look at
the populations of all the

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.920
countries in the world and
look at the leading

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:12.790
digits of all those.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.230
So for example, if it was 1,269,
then the leading digit

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.320
in that case is the one.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.240
Benford's Law works on a
distribution of numbers if

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.680
that distribution spans quite
a few orders of magnitude.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.720
And the brilliant thing about
populations of countries is

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.220
that it actually goes from
tens up to billions.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.810
If you were to think about
that, OK, what are the

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.560
distribution of leading
digits.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.770
So some of the populations will
start with the one, some

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.070
will start with two, three,
four, five, six,

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.630
seven, eight, or nine.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.030
And so there are nine possible
leading digits.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.200
And you might imagine that each
one of those possible

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.430
leading digits are equally
likely to appear.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.210
So that's one in nine--

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.010
11%.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.850
And if I was to plot that on a
graph, you might expect that

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.250
to fluctuate around 11%.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.990
So it's going to go like that.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.910
So what actually happens is
that a third of the time,

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.570
that's up here.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.460
A third of the time the
number you choose will

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.510
start with a one.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.280
And it will hardly ever
start with a nine.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.100
So nine is down here--

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.820
tiny number.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.700
And then you get this
brilliant curve that

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.355
goes up like that.

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:30.830
Isn't that crazy?

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.960
BRADY HARAN: I know you talk
about this sometimes in talks

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:33.880
and things you do.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.370
What's the reaction to
that normally when

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.390
you tell people this?

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.110
STEVE MOULD: The reaction?

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.930
The noise is sort
of like this--

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.500
ohh.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.750
And there's a certain
amount of disbelief

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.700
sometimes as well.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.370
And the way we do it actually
in the show is that we get

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.360
people to tweet numbers to us.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.070
So we're collecting numbers, and
I try to give them ideas.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.180
So maybe like, take the distance
from the venue to

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.870
where they live and convert that
into some strange units.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:01.730
Or something like that.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.250
The interesting thing is, like I
was saying, it works so long

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.280
as the distribution you're
choosing from spans loads of

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.360
orders of magnitude.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.040
But if you're picking numbers
from lots of different

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.200
distributions, the individual
distributions don't have to

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.960
span lots of orders
of magnitude.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.100
The meta-distribution of
individual things picked from

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.510
different distributions follows
Benford's Law anyway.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.790
So it works brilliantly well.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.750
BRADY HARAN: What clump
of numbers will

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.770
this not work for?

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.970
STEVE MOULD: Human
height in meters.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.380
So humans are between one
meter and three meters.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.130
So it doesn't work for that.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.370
You get a massive load
around there.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.180
And no one's nine meters tall.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.410
Anything that has that short
distribution, it

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.280
doesn't work for.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.140
But it does work for several
distributions put together

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.400
that don't necessarily
individually follow the rule.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.270
So I did it for populations.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.340
I did it for areas of countries

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.580
in kilometers squared.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.450
If you take one number and
convert it to loads of

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.810
different units, that
will tend to follow

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:11.630
Benford's Law as well.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.670
You can do it for the
Financial Times.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.380
Look at all the numbers
on the front cover of

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.740
the Financial Times.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.800
They will tend to follow
Benford's Law as well.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.220
BRADY HARAN: Just a quick
interjection--

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.090
you can also apply this to the
number of times you watch

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.570
Numberphile videos or leave
comments underneath.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.570
More information at the
end of the video.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.630
STEVE MOULD: So the explanation
is to do with

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.540
scale invariance, which
I'm just getting

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.400
my head around now.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.770
But there are a couple
of intuitive ways of

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:37.800
understanding it.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.890
One of them is to use the
idea of a raffle.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.660
To begin with, it's a
very small raffle.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.390
So there are only two tickets
in this raffle.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.040
What are the chances of the
winning ticket in this raffle

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.460
having a leading digit of one?

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.250
Well, that's this one.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.190
So it's one in two.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.630
It's 50%.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.335
But then if you increase the
size of the raffle, so there

00:03:58.335 --> 00:04:02.070
are now three tickets in the
raffle, the chance now are one

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.350
in three or about 33%.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.954
If you add a fourth ticket, then
the probability of the

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:10.070
leading digit of the winning
ticket being a one is now 25%,

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.800
and then 20%, and so on and so
on until you have a raffle

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.040
with nine tickets in it.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.114
And then the probability of the
winning ticket having a

00:04:20.114 --> 00:04:22.100
leading digit of one
is one in nine.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.040
It's 11%, which was the
intuitive thing

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.130
that you might think.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.510
But then you add your
tenth ticket.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.610
And now there are two tickets
that start with a one.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.400
So now the probability
is 2 in 10 or 1 in 5.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.980
So it would go back up to 20%.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.300
The probability will go up, and
up, and up as you add more

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.780
tickets that start with a one.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.070
And once you have a raffle with
19 tickets in it, you're

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.440
up to something like 58%.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.260
And then you add the
20th ticket.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.070
And so the probability
goes down again.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.740
So the probability of the
winning ticket having a

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.140
leading digit of one will go
down, and down, and down

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.030
through the 20s.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.550
It will go down through the
40s, down through the 50s,

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:05.380
60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, until you
add the hundredth ticket.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.620
And then the probability will
start to go up again.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.370
And then the probability will go
up, and up, and up, all the

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.950
way through the 100s.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.720
And then you get to the 200s,
and it goes down, and down,

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.710
and down through all the 200s,
300s, 400s, 500s, 600s, 700s,

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.000
800s, 900s.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.200
And you'll be back to
11% again then.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.910
Then you add the thousandth
ticket.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.130
And the probability will
start to go up again.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.932
So the probability goes up,
and up, and up through the

00:05:27.932 --> 00:05:31.010
thousands and then down through
the 2000s, 3000s,

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.160
blah, blah, blah.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.260
And then you get to 10,000
and it goes up.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.080
And so basically the probability
of the winning

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.960
ticket having any digit of one
fluctuates as the size of the

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.510
raffle increases.

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.790
And so this is a log scale of
the raffle increasing in size.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:53.320
So you might have a 10, 100,
1,000, 10,000, and so on.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.724
And then this is the probability
here of having a

00:05:55.724 --> 00:05:56.974
leading digit of one.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:04.480
It goes like that.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.660
What Frank Benford realized was
that if you pick a number

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.080
from a distribution that spans
loads of orders of magnitude,

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:17.370
or if you pick a number from
the world and you don't

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.900
necessarily know what the
distribution is in advance,

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.760
then it's like picking a ticket
from a raffle when you

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.750
don't know the size
of the raffle.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.140
So you have to take the average
of this wiggly line,

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.920
which is what he did.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.050
So that's the average there.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.660
And it's around 30%.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.380
There's a formula for it, which
is the probability of

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.460
picking a number with a
particular leading digit of d

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:47.860
is equal to log to base 10
of 1 plus 1/d, like that.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.060
And so that's how you do it.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.680
And if you plug one into
there, then it's

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.700
log base 10 of two.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.170
And it ends up being
about 30%.

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:00.170
The beauty is that you can
do it in any base.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.350
So this doesn't have
to be base 10.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.750
It could be base five, base 16,
whatever you want to do.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.700
You can apply Benford's Law
to different bases.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:13.410
This is a formula that a
forensic accountant would use

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.000
as a tax formula of something
like that.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.920
If you're making up numbers in
your accounts and the numbers

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.090
you make up don't follow
Benford's Law, then that's a

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:21.560
clue that you might
be cheating.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.105
So this is a formula you need to
remember if you're going to

00:07:25.105 --> 00:07:26.260
cheat on your tax return.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.030
BRADY HARAN: A lot of things
that mathematically inclined

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:32.370
people like yourself tell me
when I hear about them seem

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:33.460
counter-intuitive.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.280
And then you cleverly explain
why it works the way it works.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.000
This is one of the few things
that when I've heard about it,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.600
this just seems logical to me.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.390
When someone says one will come
up more often, to me that

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.110
just seems like, of course
that would happen.

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:46.360
STEVE MOULD: Yes.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.170
Funny isn't it?

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:50.750
Some people are like you.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.230
I would say you're in the
minority of people that go,

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:53.850
well, yeah.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:57.100
And I wonder if there is another
intuitive way of

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.020
looking at it that you've tapped
into, which is that if

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.670
you imagine something like
the NASDAQ index or

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:05.660
something like that--

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.830
and I don't know what the NASDAQ
index is size-wise--

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:14.480
but imagine that the NASDAQ
index is at 1,000.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.710
To change that to 2,000, you'd
have to double it.

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:22.960
So the NASDAQ index would have
to increase by 100% to get

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.460
from something that starts with
a one to something that

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:25.965
starts with a two.

00:08:25.965 --> 00:08:27.920
So that's quite a big change.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:33.400
But if the NASDAQ index was
on 9,000 and you wanted to

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:39.169
increase it to 10,000, then
that's an 11% increase.

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:40.580
So it's hardly anything.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:44.450
So basically, you don't really
hang around the nines.

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.340
As things are growing and
shrinking, you don't hang

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.010
around, whereas you do
hang around the ones.

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:50.050
And maybe that's intuitive
to you.

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:51.380
So you're like, yeah
obviously.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.460
BRADY HARAN: If you'd like to
see even more about Benford's

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.980
Law, we've done a bit of a
statistical analysis to find

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.640
out whether or not your viewing
habits and the number

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.280
of times you comment on
Numberphile videos is

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.470
following the Benford curve.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:11.540
The link is below this video
or here on the screen.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:12.790
So why don't you check it out?
