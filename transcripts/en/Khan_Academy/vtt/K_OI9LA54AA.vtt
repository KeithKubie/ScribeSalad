00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.279
So what I've drawn here
in yellow is a line.

00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:05.320
And let's say we know two
things about this line.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.170
We know that it
has a slope of m,

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.525
and we know that the point
a, b is on this line.

00:00:11.525 --> 00:00:13.900
And so the question that we're
going to try to answer is,

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.530
can we easily come
up with an equation

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.220
for this line using
this information?

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.270
Well, let's try it out.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.050
So any point on this line,
or any x, y on this line,

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.110
would have to
satisfy the condition

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.170
that the slope
between that point--

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.020
so let's say that this
is some point x, y.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.120
It's an arbitrary
point on the line--

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.190
the fact that it's
on the line tells us

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.540
that the slope between a, b
and x, y must be equal to m.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.950
So let's use that knowledge to
actually construct an equation.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.890
So what is the slope
between a, b and x, y?

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.090
Well, our change in y--
remember slope is just

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.400
change in y over change in x.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.150
Let me write that.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.900
Slope is equal to change
in y over change in x.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.930
This little triangle character,
that's the Greek letter Delta,

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.900
shorthand for change in.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.510
Our change in y--
well let's see.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.890
If we start at y is equal
to b, and if we end up

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.290
at y equals this arbitrary
y right over here,

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.497
this change in y right over
here is going to be y minus b.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.130
Let me write it in
those same colors.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.170
So this is going to be y
minus my little orange b.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.860
And that's going to be
over our change in x.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.360
And the exact same logic--
we start at x equals a.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.410
We finish at x
equals this arbitrary

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.460
x, whatever x we
happen to be at.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.370
So that change in x is
going to be that ending

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.000
point minus our starting
point-- minus a.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.320
And we know this is the slope
between these two points.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.310
That's the slope between
any two points on this line.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.150
And that's going
to be equal to m.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.950
So this is going
to be equal to m.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.960
And so what we've
already done here

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.959
is actually create an equation
that describes this line.

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:03.250
It might not be in any form
that you're used to seeing,

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.160
but this is an
equation that describes

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.130
any x, y that satisfies this
equation right over here

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.670
will be on the line because
any x, y that satisfies this,

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.460
the slope between that x, y
and this point right over here,

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.306
between the point a, b,
is going to be equal to m.

00:02:21.306 --> 00:02:24.450
So let's actually now
convert this into forms

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.050
that we might
recognize more easily.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.620
So let me paste that.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.070
So to simplify this expression
a little bit, or at least

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.660
to get rid of the x minus
a in the denominator, let's

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.590
multiply both
sides by x minus a.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.535
So if we multiply both sides
by x minus a-- so x minus a

00:02:44.535 --> 00:02:49.622
on the left-hand side and
x minus a on the right.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.660
Let me put some
parentheses around it.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.360
So we're going to multiply
both sides by x minus a.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.160
The whole point of that is you
have x minus a divided by x

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.478
minus a, which is just
going to be equal to 1.

00:03:04.478 --> 00:03:06.186
And then on the
right-hand side, you just

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:07.490
have m times x minus a.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:08.970
So this whole thing
has simplified

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:21.080
to y minus b is equal
to m times x minus a.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.180
And right here, this is
a form that people, that

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.050
mathematicians, have
categorized as point-slope form.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.380
So this right over here
is the point-slope form

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.670
of the equation that
describes this line.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.720
Now, why is it called
point-slope form?

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.090
Well, it's very easy to
inspect this and say, OK.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.860
Well look, this is the
slope of the line in green.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.340
That's the slope of the line.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.850
And I can put the two points in.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.710
If the point a, b
is on this line,

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.770
I'll have the slope times x
minus a is equal to y minus b.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.700
Now, let's see
why this is useful

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.970
or why people like to
use this type of thing.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.440
Let's not use just a, b
and a slope of m anymore.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.850
Let's make this a little
bit more concrete.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.010
Let's say that someone tells you
that I'm dealing with some line

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:15.634
where the slope is equal
to 2, and let's say

00:04:15.634 --> 00:04:17.300
it goes through the
point negative 7, 5.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.785
So very quickly, you
could use this information

00:04:24.785 --> 00:04:28.500
and your knowledge
of point-slope form

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.090
to write this in this form.

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.900
You would just say,
well, an equation that

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:39.440
contains this point and has this
slope would be y minus b, which

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.720
is 5-- y minus the
y-coordinate of the point

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:53.760
that this line contains--
is equal to my slope times x

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.730
minus the x-coordinate
that this line contains.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.230
So x minus negative 7.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.180
And just like that, we have
written an equation that

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.300
has a slope of 2
and that contains

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.140
this point right over here.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.800
And if we don't like the x minus
negative 7 right over here,

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.000
we could obviously
rewrite that as x plus 7.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.084
But this is kind of the
purest point-slope form.

00:05:14.084 --> 00:05:15.750
If you want to simplify
it a little bit,

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:22.370
you could write it as y minus
5 is equal to 2 times x plus 7.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.090
And if you want to see that this
is just one way of expressing

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.010
the equation of this line--
there are many others,

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.718
and the one that we're
most familiar with

00:05:28.718 --> 00:05:31.130
is y-intercept form--
this can easily

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.840
be converted to
y-intercept form.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.760
To do that, we just have
to distribute this 2.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:40.250
So we get y minus 5 is equal
to 2 times x plus 2 times 7, so

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:41.430
that's equal to 14.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.680
And then we can get rid of
this negative 5 on the left

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.290
by adding 5 to both
sides of this equation.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.750
And then we are left with,
on the left-hand side, y

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.680
and, on the right-hand
side, 2x plus 19.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.520
So this right over here
is slope-intercept form.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.150
You have your slope
and your y-intercept.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.050
So this is slope-intercept form.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.920
And this right up here
is point-slope form.
