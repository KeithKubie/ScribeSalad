00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.500
Hi, come on in!

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.259
This is the FDR suite

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:18.250
and our common room.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.339
Well it's a pretty nice room. It's probably one of the
nicest rooms on campus.

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:26.359
Adams houses is one of the older houses but it
also contains

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.109
a lot of the old, what they call, gold coast dormitories

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.879
which were private dorms built around the turn
of the century that were very nice and only 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:35.640
the richest Harvard students could live in them.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.890
So this is one of those dormitory complexes.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.080
This is a shrine to FDR

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.700
and we put it together

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.080
the first few weeks of school.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:53.420
This is FDR basically and the plaque that was here
when we moved in.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.540
And this is our bathroom.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.730
It's roosevelt's claw-foot bathtub

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.250
and his toilet, so he sat there and we
do now

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.710
and it's a pull chain toilet as you can see.
So you pull the chain and it flushes, and it runs

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.930
a lot but you know, it's old

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.610
almost a hundred years old so -- here we go

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.180
and it goes for a while--

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:25.180
not the most efficient fixture.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.810
See, it's still going!

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.290
Then you have to make sure

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.050
that it refills by putting the stopper back
in place. We learned that after

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.410
couple weeks.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.110
So, yeah that's the bathroom!

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.760
You get used to it really. (laughing)

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.070
So this is a letter he sent his parents about
his first week or so at Harvard, and talks

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.880
about visiting certain people

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.650
and looking for a room and so he mentions a lot
of the different

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.239
dormitories around here and

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:11.449
he actually

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:12.680
draws a sketch

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.319
of the room itself

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.879
in the letter,

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:18.269
and so you

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.290
you can see exactly where he stayed and where we are
living now.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.739
He slept here--

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.099
where we were sleeping

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.789
and it adds that kind of human touch.

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:33.719
He was a college student too,  

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:34.569
he studied too,

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:40.879
he worked on the Crimson too.

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:41.770
It does sort of add that connection

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:42.420
that was never there.
