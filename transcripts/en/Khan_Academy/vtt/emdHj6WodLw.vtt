00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.090
In the last video, I dropped
myself or a penny from the top

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.630
of a cliff.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.770
We started off at 0 velocity,
obviously because it was

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.290
stationary, and at the bottom,
it was 100 meters per second.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.660
We used that to figure out how
high the cliff was, and we

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.120
figured out that the cliff
was 500 meters high.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.310
What I want to do now is let's
do that same problem, but

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.310
let's do in a general form, and
see if we can figure out a

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.270
general formula for a
problem like that.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.920
Let's say that you have the same
thing, and let's say the

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:43.210
initial velocity-- you're given
the initial velocity,

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.900
you're given the final velocity,
you're given the

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:52.410
acceleration, and you want to
figure out the distance.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.980
This is what you're given,
and you want to

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.230
figure out the distance.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.620
Doing it the exact same way we
did in that last presentation,

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.650
but now we're now [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.740
formulas, we know that the
change in distance is equal to

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.950
the average velocity times--
we could actually say the

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.300
change in time, but I'll just
say it with time, because we

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.470
always assume that we
start with time

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.810
equals 0-- times time.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.880
We know that the average
velocity is the final velocity

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:43.190
plus the initial velocity
divided by 2, so that's the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.800
average velocity-- let me
highlight-- this is the same

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.890
thing as this, and then
that times time.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.510
What's the time?

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.120
You could figure out the time
by saying, we know how fast

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.430
we're accelerating, and we know
the initial and final

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.040
velocity, so we can figure out
how long we had to accelerate

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.580
that fast to get that
change in velocity.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.280
Another way of saying that, or
probably a simpler way of

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.730
saying that, is change in
velocity, which is the same

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.220
thing as the final velocity
minus the initial velocity is

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.230
equal to acceleration
times time.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.460
If you want to solve for time,
you could say the time-- if I

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.240
just divide both sides of this
equation by a-- is equal to vf

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.920
minus vi divided by a.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.210
We could take that and
substitute that into this

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.910
equation, and remember-- this
is all change in distance.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.190
We say change in distance is
equal to-- let me write this

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:58.740
term in yellow-- vf
plus vi over 2.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.650
Let me write this
term in green.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:10.520
That's times vf minus
vi over a.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.800
Then if we do a little
multiplying of expressions on

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.690
the top-- you might have
recognized this-- this would

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.760
be vf squared minus vi squared,
and then we multiply

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.040
the denominators over 2a.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.570
So the change in distance is
equal to vf squared minus vi

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.630
squared over 2a.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.710
That's exciting-- let me
write that over again.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:53.940
The change in distance is equal
to vf squared minus vi

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.300
squared divided by 2
times acceleration.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.710
We could play around with this a
little bit, and if we assume

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.290
that we started distance is
equal to 0, we could write d

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.150
here, and that might
simplify things.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.600
If we multiply both sides by
2a, we get-- and I'm just

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.710
going to switch this to
distance, if we assume that we

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.370
always start at distances
equal to 0.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.230
di, or initial distance,
is always at point 0.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.360
We could right 2ad-- I'm just
multiplying both sides by 2a--

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:31.860
is equal to vf squared minus vi
squared, or you could write

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:41.030
it as vf squared is equal
to vi squared plus 2ad.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.330
I don't know what your physics
teacher might show you or

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.400
written in your physics book,
but of these variations will

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.010
show up in your physics book.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.870
The reason why I wanted to show
you that previous problem

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.470
first is that I wanted to show
you that you could actually

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.900
figure out these problems
without having to always

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.780
memorize formulas and resort
to the formula.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.930
With that said, it's probably
not bad idea to memorize some

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.600
form of this formula, although
you should understand how it

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.892
was derived, and when
to apply it.

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.230
Now that you have memorized it,
or I showed you that maybe

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.920
you don't have to memorize
it, let's use this.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.970
Let's say I have the
same cliff, and it

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.490
has now turned purple.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:27.070
It was 500 meters high-- it's
a 500 meter high cliff.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.960
This time, with the penny,
instead of just dropping it

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.470
straight down, I'm going to
throw it straight up at

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.930
positive 30 meters per second.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.640
The positive matters, because
remember, we said negative is

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.450
down, positive is up-- that's
just the convention we use.

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:49.370
Let's use this formula, or any
version of this formula, to

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:56.940
figure out what our final
velocity was when we hit the

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.000
bottom of the ground.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.040
This is probably the easiest
formula to use, because it

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.240
actually solves for
final velocity.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.430
We can say the final velocity
vf squared is equal to the

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.780
initial velocity squared-- so
what's our initial velocity?

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:20.500
It's plus 30 meters per second,
so it's 30 meters per

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:26.600
second squared plus 2ad.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.550
So, 2a is the acceleration of
gravity, which is minus 10,

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:36.840
because it's going down, so it's
2a times minus 10-- I'm

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.060
going to give up the units for
a second, just so I don't run

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.300
out of space-- 2 times minus
10, and what's the height?

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.320
What's the change in distance?

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.950
Actually, I should be correct
about using change in

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:51.490
distance, because it matters
for this problem.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.520
In this case, the final distance
is equal to minus

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.550
500, and the initial distance
is equal to 0.

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:07.170
The change in distance
is minus 500.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:08.450
So what does this get us?

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:15.710
We get vf squared is equal to
900, and the negatives cancel

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:26.570
out-- 10 times 500 is 5,000, and
5,000 times 2 is 10,000.

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:37.220
So vf squared is equal
to 10,900.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:45.460
So the final velocity is equal
to the square root of 10,900.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:46.000
What is that?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:53.310
Let me bring over my trusty
Windows-provided default

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:54.550
calculator.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:08:01.830
It's 10,900, and the
square root.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:15.110
It's about 104 meters per
second, so my final velocity

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.530
is approximately-- that
squiggly equals is

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:22.060
approximately-- 104
meters per second.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.090
That's interesting.

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:26.710
If I just dropped something--
if I just drop it straight

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:28.820
from the top-- we figured out
in the last problem that at

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.810
the end, I'm at 100
meters per second.

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:35.000
But this time, if I throw it
straight up at 30 meters per

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.559
second, when the penny hits
the ground, it's actually

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:40.480
going even faster.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.799
You might want to think about
why that is, and you might

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:44.380
realize it.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.960
When I throw it up, the highest
point of the penny--

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.230
if I throw it up at 30 meters
per second, the highest point

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:53.320
of the penny is going to be
higher than 500 meters-- is

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.250
going to make some positive
distance first, and then it's

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.030
going to come down, so it's
going to have even more time

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:00.910
to accelerate.

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:05.660
I think that makes some
intuitive sense to you.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.890
That's all the time I have
now, and in the next

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.800
presentation, maybe I'll use
this formula to solve a couple

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.420
of other types of problems.
