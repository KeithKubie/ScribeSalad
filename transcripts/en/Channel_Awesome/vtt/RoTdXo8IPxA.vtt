00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.340
Jim: Jessie...

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.160
Why don't you hang out with anyone?

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.320
It's like...

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.540
...you don't want anyone to get close to you.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.940
Narrator: A reclusive shut-in...

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.780
...with a powerful secret.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.860
Jessie: Anyone I touch becomes incredibly strong, to the point of being invincible.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.740
No one should have that much power.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.840
Narrator: An eccentric businessman...

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.700
Doug: Hey, Elsa,

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.440
think you're gonna take off those gloves today?

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.500
*snotty laughter*

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.860
Narrator: moving up in the world.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.240
Malcolm: Anyone I touch becomes incredibly sick.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.760
Usually... to the point of death.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.700
Narrator: A mysterious stranger

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.440
who knows why.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.840
Stranger: I've been following you for some time.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.760
I know what you are.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.040
Narrator: And a battle...

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.540
Jessie: Tell us what's going on here.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.900
Narrator: ...there's no turning back from.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.200
Stranger: It's all very simple.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.480
The two of you must destroy each other.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.440
Narrator: See the most disturbing film of the year.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.000
Not because of its commentary.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.700
Not because of its psychological portrayal.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.700
But because it's not

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.840
based

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.640
on

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.140
anything.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.920
Both: What?

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.900
Narrator: I said it's not

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.200
based

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.500
on anything.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.900
Jessie: It has to be based on a comic!

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.840
Narrator: It's not based on a comic.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.160
Malcolm: It's gotta be based on a movie.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.200
Narrator: It's not based on a movie.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.020
Jessie: Maybe it's based on a show that wasn't bad,

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.600
but wasn't great,

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.160
but still deserved more of a chance.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.560
Narrator: It's not based on Pushing Up Daisies.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.160
Jessie: Damn it!

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.300
Malcolm: How can we take a gamble on something without a fanbase?

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.500
Stranger: You'll just have to be interesting.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.060
Jessie: No!

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.200
Stranger: Unpredictable.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.800
Malcolm: No!

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.300
Stranger: Not relying on nostalgia.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.800
*table smack*

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.120
Jessie: You inhuman monster!

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.140
Stranger: *maniacal laughter*

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.300
Narrator: Starring...

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.640
A Black Guy Who Was Always Written As a Black Guy

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.920
Malcolm: Wait, I wasn't originally written as a white dude?

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.840
Narrator: No.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.000
And A Woman Who Was Always Written As a Woman.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.440
Jessie: Wait, I wasn't originally a white dude?

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.540
Narrator: No.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.840
Malcolm: How are we supposed to cause controversy on the internet?

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.260
Narrator: You actually have to say something new,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.760
Both: *gasp*

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.700
Narrator: relevant,

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.400
Both: *gasp again*

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.880
Narrator: and rely on word of mouth AFTER it comes out.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.960
Both:NOOOOOOOO!!!

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.960
Narrator: Face the horrors of...

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.660
It's like a bad dream.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.760
NC: HMPH!!

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.800
Oh, thank God.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.600
NC: Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.600
I remember it so you don't have to.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.260
In 1965, a primetime Western comedy aired on TV called "Wild Wild West".

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.000
And that's all you need to know.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.600
The movie has no connection beyond that.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.500
Based on the series about a duo of cowboys who get into gun-slinging adventures,

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.400
the movie goes for a slightly different take,

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.020
with Will Smith as the lead,

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.040
a steam-powered wheelchair with a drunk Kenneth Branagh attached,

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.500
and a giant mechanical spider blowing up cities with fireballs.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.160
That's the big screen adaptation I would think of with a show like this.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.000
Jim West (TV show): Don't judge a house by its shutters.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.860
Artemus Gordon (TV show): And how about windows?

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.500
NC: Not only was this known as the worst film from Kevin Kline,

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.400
the worst film from Kenneth Branagh,

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.000
and the worst film from Barry Sonnenfeld...

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.700
for the moment

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.900
...but this was the movie that busted Will Smith's success streak.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.400
After leaving his smash show and making gigantic hits all in a row,

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.900
this was the first film to have us say,

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.400
"Damn it!

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.200
We have to hate Will Smith in something!"

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:18.400
Granted, we would eventually get used to that feeling...

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.000
NC: but this was the movie that started it!

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.900
Did the show even have that big a following to throw this much money at it?

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.800
Did they think kids were really gonna get excited for a Western from the 60s?

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.420
It's one of Hollywood's biggest headscratchers.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.240
So what the hell went wrong?

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.860
Well, saddle up and get ready to cry into the sunset.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.860
This is Wild Wild West.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:42.980
NC: And you immediately lost me.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.600
How'd you do that?

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.940
How'd you d- Was that a second?

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.400
Was that even a second?

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.640
That was amazing.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.100
What would make me want to know what happens to a man with a hubcap neck brace

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.100
being chased by a plastic pizza from the Ninja Turtle toy?

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.760
This movie raises questions.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.740
Like:

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.440
Why would I want to watch this movie?

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.960
We then cut...

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:00.600
*buh dum bump*

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.140
to Will Smith making love in a water silo.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.320
(Chuckles) Trust me.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.720
This isn't the only time a large group of people will taste Will Smith not giving a shit.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.500
NC: Mmm, that's good algae!

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.020
West: I'm not working.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.020
NC: Oh, don't worry, Will.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.520
Nobody will think you're working when you're in this film.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.000
Girl: Problem solved.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.340
West: Hold on there, Belle.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.100
You can't just go ramming a man's personal things into some hole like that.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.640
NC: Actually, this film was PG-13 before that meant PG, so you might want to change that.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:40.160
That works.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.200
But it just be raining black people in New York as he falls out of the silo and onto a bunch of smugglers.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.800
Man: Well, well.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.820
We got us a shy nig-

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:51.760
Samuel Johnson: What did he say?

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.440
Olson Johnson: The sheriff is near!

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.080
*ta-da*

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.860
NC: He wants to figure out where these smugglers came from,

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.400
so he traces them back to a brothel where...

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.720
KENTUCKY FRIED JESUS!!

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.500
Gordon: (in a high female voice) I'm very flattered, but I'm just not interested.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.020
NC: Okay...

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.400
Does this Western take place in progressive times

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.400
or is that honestly supposed to fool us?

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.040
Gordon: (in a woman voice) Oh, I'm so sorry. That won't be possible. I have uh...

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.560
tonsillitis.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.840
NC: (Imitates Gordon's woman voice) I identify as unfunny.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.500
Man: You gotta be interested. You're a whore!

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.780
Gordon: (normal voice) I work alone!

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:24.360
NC: Huh.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.840
Thought you were above the obvious booby trap line, huh?

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:27.940
Well, don't worry.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.060
There's plenty of other unfunny lines to make up for it,

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.760
like when we see how Donald Trump inspects his wives...

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.060
Hey, he sacrificed a lot.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.300
and one of the henchmen chooses Kline.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:39.560
Oh, hey!

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.000
Now we know how Michael Bay gets people to see his movies.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.140
You ever really step back and look at Megan Fox?

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.400
Gordon: Now tell me.Who was in that sack in the other room?

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.980
Which scientist is it?

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:48.980
Is it Dr. Escobar?

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:49.660
Who do you work for?

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.220
Who paid you to kidnap Escobar?

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.400
NC: (As Gordon) And tell me who's stopping me from being humorous until Bob's Burgers!

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.100
Smith interrupts, but a wagon of explosions is sent hurtling towards them.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.420
West and Gordon: Now what?

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.180
NC: It blows up the tavern and...

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.600
we'll just assume they survived.

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:08.480
Yeah,

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.480
it's kind of like Batman in a death trap.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.180
Who really cares how he escapes, outside of everybody?

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.240
*hip hop music*

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.160
NC (as West): Hey, everyone.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.000
Um...

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:19.540
I was looking for the tone.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.440
Does anybody know the tone?

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:25.360
I'm getting kind of a Baz Luhrmann-Mel Brooks thing.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:26.700
Is that what we're doing?

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.840
I mean, I see Kevin Kline in more obvious bad makeup,

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:30.600
so I didn't know-

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:31.260
...oh.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
Oh, OH, OH, we're supposed to fall for that.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:34.180
I mean, uh,

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.200
who is that person obviously not Kevin Kline?

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.500
NC (normal): Yeah, he does a dual performance in this as both the spy and President Grant for...

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:48.500
honestly no reason except to give the impression that he's great at disguises.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.380
Gordon: (as President Grant) I am the President of-

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:51.500
(as self) I'm Artemus Gordon.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.400
How did you know?

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.800
West: The President went to West Point.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:54.700
That says Harvard.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.420
NC: Also, you're... terrible at what you do.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:03.500
NC: Yeah, the comedy behind these disguises doesn't work if they're THIS obvious.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.000
How much funnier would it be if when he's dressed up like a woman,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.800
they hired a real woman?

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.520
Like his makeup is that good?

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.420
Or even if he's gonna look like himself,

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.940
why not have the voice of a real woman come out of his mouth?

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.240
There's like a million ways that this could actually be made funny.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:17.840
But nope.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:18.740
Instead, they're just like,

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.280
"Hey, did you see Fierce Creatures?

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.660
Neither did anyone else! So we can steal from that!"

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.720
President Grant: One day it's going to get you killed.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.700
NC: He talks about all these kidnapped scientists,

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:30.520
and, of course, wants Smith and Kline to work together because "ha-ha".

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.240
West: I don't need Intelligence to tell me that.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.740
Gordon: No, you'd rather rely on stupidity.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.240
Grant: Look, you two are the best I've got.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:36.760
NC: (confused) Really?

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.100
Grant: Find this madman, whoever he is.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:43.860
NC (as Grant): And please do so with half the props from Jackie Chan's Around the World in 80 Days.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.120
Otto: Asshole!

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.200
NC: Smith catches up with Kline's awful green screen,

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.600
but Kline's awfully pointless trampoline floor

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.100
leads to Kline's awfully unfunny knee-slapper.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:56.980
Gordon: How nice of you to drop in.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.400
NC (As Gordon): Do you like that line?

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.220
I got it from Fuller House.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.180
Gordon: I'm just putting the final touches on my latest invention.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:03.700
NC: Comedy?

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:04.900
Gordon: The Impermeable.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.220
NC: Yeah, I knew you would make that.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:11.200
So they put a light in a man's head to see the last thing he saw before he died...

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:16.500
...and realize that they have to go to a costume party to figure out who's the villain behind it.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:21.080
West: I'd go as a government agent who's going to shoot and kill General "Bloodbath" McGrath.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.100
Gordon: An armed, Negro cowboy costume

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.400
in a room full of white Southern former slave owners.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:29.200
NC: Yeah, why did the President choose a black guy to blend into the Deep South?

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:33.020
But, per Kline's ever-expanding fetish,

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.060
he wants Smith to dress up as a woman.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.500
Gordon: Afraid you're wrong. Touch my breasts.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.460
Just one. Touch one.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:39.780
West: Okay.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.940
You happy, Gordon? I'm touching your breasts.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:42.940
Driver: I knew it.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.740
Gordon: Wait, wait, wait. Squeeze it gently.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.600
Not that hard.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.960
NC: Let's measure the awkwardness from the faces you're making right now!

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.700
You might notice a lack of laughter and an inability to find joy.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.700
You'll find that your face has entered the "Dazed and Abandoned Mode."

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:04.800
This is when you slip into a hypnotic state of annoyance where you want to be angry,

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.500
yet all emotion has been drained from you,

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.020
to a point where you don't even care or remember why.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.220
Gordon: Now you've shifted all the buckwheat around.

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:13.160
West: Buckwheat?

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.300
That's your problem.

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:16.860
Now touch my breast.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.740
NC: Upon further inspection,

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.940
we now see that your face has entered the "Hollow Mode."

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.960
This is where your mind has left your body,

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.860
leaving you, like the movie, an empty hollow shell.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.940
You feel nothing, want nothing, so will take nothing.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.300
Gordon: Ooh.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:34.820
West: Huh?

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:36.660
Now that's what a breast is supposed to feel like.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.280
Gordon: Very nice.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.000
NC: The next phase is called the "Dead Mode."

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.720
You are physically dead right now.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.960
You have surrendered your life to this awful moment, and it has claimed you.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:50.300
You discover that the afterlife is bleak and meaningless.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:51.700
West: Now touch yourself.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.420
Gordon: Oh, my God, I'm hard.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.700
NC: And finally, we have the "Zombie Mode."

00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.220
Just when you thought death was the end,

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.040
it turns out to only be the beginning.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.300
The pain, suffering, and long-lasting thirst for blood

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.800
will lead you on a quest to search for brains,

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.260
but find none from anyone who has been associated with this movie.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.240
I'm sorry.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.220
I'm... just sorry.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.540
So Smith sneaks into the party, where he sees a dancer,

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:21.620
played by Salma Hayek,

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:24.460
being forced against her will to make love to a man

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:28.000
and even gets choked to partake in his kinky sex games.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:30.440
Well, sucks to be her.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.640
Off you go, Will Smith.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.800
Sometimes a bitch just gotta be choked.

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:36.100
Mae Lee: What a terribly clever costume,

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:36.820
Mr...

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.100
West: Jim West.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:39.620
NC (As West): Yeah.

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:43.380
Kinda wondering why I snuck in here if nobody was going to question why I was here.

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:45.700
Mae Lee: West meets East.

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:47.500
Mae Lee East.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.000
West: Ma'am.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.760
NC (As West): Oh, by the way, there's a woman getting strangled and

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:51.580
...eh, never mind.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.480
Mae Lee: See anybody that looks familiar?

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.680
West: As a matter of fact, I do.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:56.200
NC: (normal) Her name is

00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:00.500
Joke Everyone Can See Coming Where It's Actually A Lady This Time And Not Kevin Kline In Drag.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:01.780
It's Norwegian, I think.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.520
Give our villain some credit for having arguably the weirdest

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.700
FUCKING entrance everyone's ever seen in a Western.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:12.800
Girls: (singing) His truth is marching on!

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:17.660
NC: (Chuckles)

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.000
I don't think Bugs Bunny could've come out that smoothly.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:21.100
*slide whistle up*

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:25.300
Dr. Arliss Loveless: Don't you just HATE that song?

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.120
NC: I feel like Branagh missed his true calling as a Whack-a-Mole.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.740
Loveless: Why, you all look like you've seen a ghost.

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:36.980
NC: This is Dr. Loveless

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:41.040
...because every doctor with the word "Love" in his name has to be in a wheelchair...

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.580
and he seeks revenge for the South losing the war.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.700
Smith however, plans to stop him by making obvious jokes.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.740
West: I find that an occasion to stand up.

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.480
Loveless: I haven't seen him in a coon's age.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.740
West: A man of your stature to keep in touch with even

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:54.860
half the people you know.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:58.860
Loveless: Perhaps the lovely Miss East will keep you from being a slave to your disappointment.

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.200
West: They encourage you one minute, then

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.040
cut the legs out from under you the next.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.300
NC: (as Loveless) Your mama's so fat,

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.920
she almost ate the black off you.

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:05.740
(as West) Your mama's so fat,

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:06.960
you're in a wheelchair!

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.780
(normal) So, Smith tells Kline to meet him outside.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:11.900
Kline being obviously here

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:12.940
and not here,

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:14.620
but the film thinks we don't know that.

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:17.260
West: You're in for a big surprise when you get this one in the saddle.

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:20.420
NC: Keep holding my hand, movie.

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.000
Make sure I don't poop myself.

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:24.600
In fact, they think you're so dumb

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.560
that they actually end up doing this joke twice.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:32.240
Maybe they think the first time they did it was so subtle that they just had to spell it out more.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.760
Gordon: Hang him!

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.580
NC: As the crowd wants to hang Smith for touching the woman's breasts,

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.800
but figure it's crueler to let him hang himself,

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:43.200
for there is a solid two minutes of Will Smith just talking on its own,

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.300
and... it's painful. It's so painful.

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.700
It's like watching a flame war on the YouTube comments:

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.120
Not funny, not smart and everybody loses.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.060
West: The whole drumming on the boobies thing.

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:54.580
All I was saying to the gal was,

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.080
"Nice dress, darling.

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.880
Good to see you. My name's Jim. How's your mama?"

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:02.620
NC: You can actually see Will Smith's worth dropping with every joke that bombs.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:03.940
West: The whole slavery thing,

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.260
I don't understand what the big deal was anyway.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:07.180
I mean, come on.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:10.360
Who wouldn't want folks running around doing things for them, doing chores?

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:12.620
Then there was the Redneck comment.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:14.440
First word: Red!

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.080
Color of passion!

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.100
FIRE! POWER!

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:18.960
Second word: Neck!

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:22.480
NECK!!

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:25.240
Harriet Johnson: Isn't anybody gonna help that poor man?

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.160
*tada-da*

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.560
NC: But Kline saves him, while also saving Hayek,

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:35.980
as apparently, nobody can catch up to this incredibly slow-moving carriage of non-speed.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.080
Slower! SLOWER!!

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.200
Rita: My name is Rita Escobar.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:44.260
I came to find Guillermo Escobar, the scientist. My father.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:45.600
NC: By the way, if you haven't noticed yet,

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.100
Hayek's performance is not exactly the most invested.

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:52.920
Rita: I'm a frightened, starving, half-naked young woman who only wants to find her father.

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:54.220
Nice try, buster.

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:55.320
What's going on?

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:57.120
Oh, aren't you boys nice?

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.500
NC: You'd swear she's focusing less on her acting

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.540
and more on eyeing the catering table.

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:05.520
Like the faster she finishes, the faster she can get to that delicious cronut.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:09.040
But what do you expect when you look over the director's chair and all you see is this.

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:12.720
Yeah, he's off to figure out how not to work with Tommy Lee Jones.

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:14.460
*ding*

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.740
NC: Branagh approaches his Confederate henchman,

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:19.600
but it looks like the movie wants to kill itself as much as we do.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.300
McGrath: You sawed-off sadistic bastard!

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.400
Loveless: You surrendered at Appomattox!

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.900
So who betrayed whom?

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:29.040
NC (As Loveless): As one half of Gary Oldman, both literally and figuratively,

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:31.480
I need my evil to outweigh my practicality.

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.520
(normal) And how's this for a joke?

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.900
He kills the guy with the horn in his ear as the dog takes a look,

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:39.180
recreating the RCA logo.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:43.240
That'll get all you young'uns rolling in the aisles!

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.320
*sigh*

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.480
Every minute, this movie brings a new sigh I didn't know I could make.

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:49.340
But, HEY!

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:54.140
After 50 minutes of boob jokes, steam tanks, and exploding Abe Lincoln heads,

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.480
let's get serious for a minute.

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:57.540
Gordon: You saw it?

00:15:58.580 --> 00:15:59.440
West: Heard about it.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:01.700
A week before the war ended in '65,

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:03.200
I was with the 9th Cavalry.

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:07.580
We discovered old folks, women and children slaughtered.

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.220
They used them for target practice.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.700
NC: Women and children used as target practice!

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:13.800
Wild Wild West!

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.920
When I stroll into the Wild Wild West!

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.700
Oh, man, this movie's really saying something.

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:24.140
Obviously, it really earned this super dramatic, grim moment.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:28.480
Let's allow the emotion of this incredibly disturbing imagery to sink in...

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.200
...with jokes about Salma Hayek's ass,

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.620
which immediately follows.

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.600
Gordon: God, the curvature of her buttocks...

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.740
NC: Not even kidding.

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:39.600
The very next scene is just making jokes about her ass.

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.000
Gordon: She's a breath of fresh ass.

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:42.100
West: You said "ass".

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:43.400
Gordon: She's a breast of fresh air.

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:44.980
West: Let's just get some shut-ass.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.000
NC: Totally makes you forget about the whole

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.460
"women and children being used as target practice"...

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:50.220
fuck!

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:55.960
I do wish more movies would mix Pluto Nash-style humor with Holocaust imagery.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:58.540
You know, this film is so harsh and empty,

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:00.860
I feel like Nietzsche wrote something about it.

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:04.880
Well fucking said.

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:22.580
NC: So, it looks like Branagh's train tries to attack our heroes.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.780
but Hayek, being quite the whiny little cry-baby,

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:28.920
uses the gas ball to accidentally knock out Will Smith.

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:29.960
Gordon: Jim.

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:36.860
NC:(confused): I...uh...

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.460
*clears throat* Did we miss a scene?

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.480
Loveless: What a marvelous train.

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:42.680
You don't mind me borrowing it, do you, gentlemen?

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.400
Aside from a lack of wheelchair access,

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:49.540
I find it a most comfortable way to pass the long miles from here to my laboratory...

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:53.600
NC: Uh, yeah, try monologuing BEFORE the train leaves.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.740
I'm not sure how much of that they're gonna pick up.

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:59.960
(as Loveless from far away) and then I will take this side, and that side *indistinct*

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.000
ha ha

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.900
*more far-away monologue*

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.680
pineapple head.

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.180
(normal) So, like before,

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:09.200
a buzzsaw flies towards them to try and take their heads off.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:13.580
And here I thought those collars were used to stop them from chewing off any more scenery.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:16.900
They outrun the saw,

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.560
but the magnets seem to go haywire in their collars.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:25.940
Gordon: You alright?

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:27.060
West: Yeah, I'm just peachy.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.800
C-Can you help me get my boot off, please?

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:33.920
Hey! HEY!!

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:34.840
Gordon: Oh, sorry.

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:36.900
West: All right, Gordon.

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.140
I'm gonna undo your belt.

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:40.580
I'm gonna run as fast as I can that way,

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:42.260
you run as fast as you can that other way.

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:43.860
Gordon: Let me make sure I understand your plan.

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:45.680
You're gonna run as fast as you can that way,

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.600
and I'm gonna run as fast as I can that way.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.700
NC: So, um...

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:52.520
*clears throat* Was there anybody left in the theater at this point?

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:55.380
Was there any one person who was like

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.000
"I wanna see where this is going.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.080
*stutter* I put my trust in this,

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.600
that this will lead somewhere worthwhile."?

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.800
Even the insects who eat off the theater floor are like...

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.200
Mosquito Doug: Hey, where did all the people go?

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.700
Mosquito Malcolm: Yeah, there's usually more food on the ground than this.

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:12.260
Mosquito Tamara: Is there a reason that the projectionist just hung himself with the film strip?

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:14.840
Mosquito Malcolm: Could it be that this movie has something to do with it?

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:15.480
Mosquito Doug: I don't know.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.000
Let's watch.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.700
West: Gordon, I think you need to calm down.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.780
Gordon: I can't be calm! No, no, no, no!

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:23.600
I'm the master of the mechanical STUFF!!

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.500
And I have to help you!

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:29.360
You, the master of the STUPID stuff!

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.080
Mosquito Malcolm: *deep breath*

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:31.580
*dies*

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.400
Mosquito Doug: Oh, that's just selfish! Who's gonna gas me?

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:39.000
NC: So they escape and finally see what Branagh has been working on this whole time.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.700
A great, big, mechanical spider.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.660
I would cut to my Dr. Smith character doing the traditional "SPIIIDERS!" thing, but, honestly,

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.580
I don't think it's worth the makeup.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.500
I know it's not.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.700
So, Smith and Kline try to leap into action.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.440
West: You do know how to ride, don't you?

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:01.860
Gordon: Yes, I know how to ride.

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:03.160
West: A horse?

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.260
Gordon: Yes, when the situation calls for something primitive.

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:05.980
West: How about now?

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:08.300
There's a gigantic spider stomping toward our President.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:12.100
NC: And in that very moment, right after saying that line,

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:13.580
Will Smith realizes,

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:15.880
"I said yes to the script."

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:18.360
Look at his face, you can totally see it in his eyes.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.380
You fucked up, Will.

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:24.880
The spider makes its way to the president with Branagh steering it.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:26.580
President Grant: Good Lord.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.900
NC (as Grant): That is the stupidest thing I've ever seen.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.300
(normal) They do to Will Smith what should have been done to this movie,

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:38.220
as we're stuck with several long minutes just hearing Branagh prattle on.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.980
Loveless: The wrongs will be righted,

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.100
the past made PRESENT,

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.320
the United

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:48.000
DIVIDED!

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.200
NC: Okay, if I wanted to watch Branagh overact and not know what he's saying,

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.620
I'd watch Henry V.

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:56.080
Loveless: We make this as legal as possible.

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.840
And, personally, I like the symmetry of it.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:20:59.900
NC: Oh, yeah, I forgot.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:01.320
It's a Sonnenfeld movie.

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.400
So, we have to have WEIRD SHOTS

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.900
for the sake of just having weird shots.

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:10.400
I usually don't mind, except that he's WAY too in love with this one angle.

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:14.260
Seriously, count how many times they cut back to his pillow-cheeked mug

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:16.360
spinning around like a drunk bumper car.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.640
Loveless: (sped-up) 1776, wasn't it, old bean?

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:20.800
Manhattan, for a handful of beads.

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:21.800
How.

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.060
The wrongs will be righted,

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:26.120
the past made present.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.800
*crowd cheering*

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.620
And, personally, I like the symmetry of it.

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:34.700
NC: Why would anyone keep cutting back to the same shot of a person just sitting down?

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.280
*ding*

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.960
Smith realizes the movie left him,

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.720
so he tries to figure out a way to sneak inside the spider.

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:44.800
And it's... *sigh* Just watch.

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:53.620
NC: Yep, a very select number of nightclubs are made very happy right now,

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:56.740
while everyone else watches in awkward discomfort.

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:04.300
What I love about this scene

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:08.700
is that Branagh's been addressing this gigantic crowd of people this whole time,

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.800
and then, he just stops out of nowhere to get horny,

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.800
and forces everybody to watch him.

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:17.200
It's like if a football coach was giving a speech and was like:

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.920
(as coach) I want you to look deep inside yourselves and find that special-

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.000
Ooh, a hot cheerleader!

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.160
Football player: Um, coach

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:26.440
...are you okay?

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.280
NC: (as coach) Everything stops when my pants are jumping!

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.900
F.P.: Well, uh, can we at least go?

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.900
NC: (as coach) YOU WILL WATCH MY ADVANCES!!!

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:35.160
Hey, baby.

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:40.300
Loveless: Well, what a nice surprise.

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:41.220
NC: (as Loveless) Hey, there.

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:45.200
I made a bunch of racist comments earlier to a man who looks just like you,

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.360
but I'm suddenly gonna forget all that and say

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.240
hubba-hubba!

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.760
Oh, you kid!

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:52.100
(normal) But the break-out plan doesn't work

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:53.740
Well, *desk slap* actually, it does.

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:57.160
They just go through the same pattern of dumb lines and getting captured again.

00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.220
Because if it's broke, don't fix it.

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:01.800
...resulting in Smith fighting off his henchmen

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.940
while Branagh destroys a random town.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:09.360
(as civilian): Huh. Don't know how we didn't see that coming a literal mile away.

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:11.700
I really should pay attention to more current events.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.200
West: That's it,

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.540
no more Mr. Knife Guy.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:25.100
NC: So, which Game of Thrones death would you like to give this movie?

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.760
Red Wedding's always good.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:27.560
The Poisoned Goblet,

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:28.500
always a classic.

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:31.280
Have they ever stuffed a horse inside somebody?

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:33.200
But it's okay,

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.880
because just as Smith looks like he's about to get axed off...

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:36.700
Henchman: *scream*

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.100
NC: Um

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.020
Your guess is as good as mine.

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:43.000
I have no idea that was.

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:45.400
I guess if you explain anything anymore,

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.600
the terrorists win.

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:50.620
But Branagh turns into a spider himself...

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:55.120
Because that ONE idiot who watched this all the way through has to be punished somehow...

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:58.900
But the machine gets out of control and walks its way off a cliff.

00:23:59.040 --> 00:23:59.900
Branagh is killed,

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:02.220
Smith and Kline are awarded by the President,

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:05.580
and we're all reminded that Salma Hayek was in this movie, oh yeah.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.700
Rita: I'm afraid I haven't been completely honest with you.

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:11.100
Professor Escobar is not my father,

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.580
he's my husband.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:17.500
NC: Well, *sigh* so, not only did she contribute nothing, like, at all...

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.620
but she was already taken this whole time.

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:22.600
This quote/unquote "twist" is so lame

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.720
that even the main characters point out how it makes no sense!

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.820
West: You could've told us that from the beginning, Rita.

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:28.840
Gordon: Yes.

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:30.600
NC: Look at the expression on Kline.

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:34.400
He legitimately has no idea why this was a thing.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.900
Her character, the romance, why she lied about her husband being her father,

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.860
Not ONE goddamn answer!

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:40.940
Gordon: Yes.

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.440
NC: I think they cut before he grabbed the camera and

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.860
stabbed anybody who dare look him in the eye!

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:50.300
And... what high joke do they go out on to end the film?

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:51.980
Gordon: Mind if I ask you a question?

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:54.680
West: Actually, I do, Artie.

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:01.440
NC: Um,

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:04.340
I'll share it with you when they actually give one.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.160
NC: COMEDY!

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:08.700
*desk smack*

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.880
That is what this was meant to be, right?

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:18.220
This is one of the biggest high-budget cinematic question marks.

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:20.500
At least with most bad, unfunny films,

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:24.400
you have an idea of what they were going for and it just didn't work.

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:27.000
This is like an anti-comedy.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:33.800
Just scenes that happen and they're not really sure if they're funny or adventurous or dramatic,

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:36.340
just as long as you're somehow suffering.

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:39.000
The chemistry between the characters is non-existent,

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.600
the effects are not very good,

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.740
the jokes are uncomfortable at best,

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:47.520
and the amount of dead air in between them could fill the spaces between stars.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.120
And on top of all of that,

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:54.000
it's based on an idea that I'm sure is fine for its time and has a small audience,

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.020
but very clearly had no success guaranteed in any part of it,

00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:00.400
even with all the money and celebrities.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:04.460
To put this comedy simply, I just don't get it.

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:07.300
But at the very least,

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:10.020
we know it can't do anyone else any more harm.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:11.500
I'm the Nostalgia Critic.

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:12.100
I reme-
Mosquito Doug: Hey, buddy.

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:14.360
Could you, like, use that can of Raid on me?

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:15.820
NC: Uh, sure.

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:18.420
Mosquito Doug: God bless you, sir.

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:18.920
*dies*

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.840
NC: (confused) I remember it so you don't have to.

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:25.400
Coming next week,

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.940
it's a review of all the Looney Tunes movies.

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:30.220
Every single one that's ever hit the theaters.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:33.420
But, you can see it now under Vessel's ad-free early access.

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.500

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.600
Doug: Hey, Doug Walker here doing the Charity Shout-out.

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:26.060
The week we are doing The Starlight Children's Foundation.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:30.560
Since being formed an Australian children's charity in 1988,

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:35.200
this foundation has brightened the lives of seriously ill and hospitalized children,

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.060
young people,

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:38.060
and their families throughout Australia.

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:44.040
Living with illness or injury can cause enormous strain in the lives children and their families.

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:49.600
The pain, loneliness and isolation that sick children feel dominates their lives.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:54.660
And they often miss out normal experiences that healthy children take for granted.

00:27:55.180 --> 00:28:00.440
Starlight proves programs integral to the care of seriously ill children.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:03.300
While health professions focus on treating the illness,

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.120
Starlight is there to lift the spirits of the child.

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:10.660
Giving them the opportunity to laugh, play, and just be children again.

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.820
If you go to their website or especially their YouTube channel,

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:15.700
you can see all the adorable,

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:19.980
beautiful children that deserve so much love and so much laughter.

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:25.360
These are good people trying to bring so much joy in to the world, and you can help them do it.

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:30.380
