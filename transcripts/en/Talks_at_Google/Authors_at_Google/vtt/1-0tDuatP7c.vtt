SUNNI YUEN: OK, welcome
to today's talk at Google.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.260
I'm Sunni Yuen.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.470
I'm a member of
Google's legal team

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.950
and also a member
of the Talks team.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.600
And this is Manushu Shah, who
is a software engineer and also

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.390
a member.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.400
And today, we're here
to welcome Nikhil Goyal.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.820
Nikhil Goyal is a 20-year-old
education activist

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.980
who has been lauded by
the "Washington Post"

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.610
as the future
education secretary.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.440
No pressure there.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.010
And also named by "Forbes"
as one of the top 30

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.250
under 30 list.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.370
Nikhil is known for his
passionate viewpoints

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.050
on the existing American
education system, K to 12,

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.020
and his bold ideas for
how to revolutionize it.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.952
So welcome, Nikhil.

00:00:41.952 --> 00:00:43.410
NIKHIL GOYAL: Thanks
for having me.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.260
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.930
So I'd love to talk for
just a couple minutes,

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.600
and then we can jump into a
more extended Q&amp;A and more

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.200
conversation-based format.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.300
So to give a little
background of my story,

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.370
I graduated from Syosset
High School on Long Island

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.346
in January 2013.

00:01:03.346 --> 00:01:04.970
It's a fairly
high-ranking high school.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.460
A lot of kids go onto
Ivy League institutions.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.730
It's one of the highest-ranking
on the "Newsweek"

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.580
rankings at least.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.060
And at school, I
became very frustrated

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.840
with the way schooling was done.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.070
And I noticed a
couple of things.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.040
One, that students
at my school, they

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.860
were incredibly stressed out.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.780
They were depressed, anxious.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.890
They were hooked on
prescription drugs.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.830
They were, overall, really
unhealthy human beings.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.900
And they were sacrificing a lot
of their sleep, mental health,

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.060
well-being and happiness in
order for this one pursuit

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.880
of getting into college.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.965
So everything in
terms of their grades,

00:01:43.965 --> 00:01:45.340
their extracurricular
activities,

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.790
was dedicated to padding
their college application.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.510
And I felt that this was a
very artificial and not so

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.510
worthwhile task.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.480
That you're losing a lot
of the joy and creativity

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.550
in learning when you
are single-handedly

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.370
pursuing this goal that may
not lead to necessarily success

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.550
later on in life.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.917
And I was looking
at these problems.

00:02:07.917 --> 00:02:09.000
I was talking to teachers.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.666
I was speaking with
students about, what

00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:13.830
do they think about their
schooling experiences,

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.940
their problems with the
system, their critiques of it?

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.720
And that just led
me to do research

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.240
on the American
education system.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.300
I was somebody who,
throughout my time in school,

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.730
was somebody who did not
really enjoy school very much.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.200
I found it to be very
boring, alienating.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.970
And oftentimes, did
not really satisfy

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.920
what I was most
interested in, which

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.310
was politics, and
current affairs,

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.140
and international relations.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.410
These topics were
not discussed at all

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.665
in the regular school day.

00:02:42.665 --> 00:02:44.290
But what was quite
interesting and what

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.400
I learned in high
school was that I

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.580
found the most worthwhile
experiences to be after school.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.960
So in my friend's
[INAUDIBLE] debate

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.190
team, or my
cross-country team where

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.790
I was a runner all year long.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.450
Or going on the UN model team.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.950
Those kinds of
experiences where I

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.670
was allowed to engage in
experiential, hands-on,

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.770
project-based
learning experiences.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.640
Where I was allowed to work
with people of different ages.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.670
Where I was allowed to use the
real world as my classroom as

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.420
opposed to sitting
in a school building,

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.890
those experiences really
gave me a better insight

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.250
on how the world works.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.190
How social change happens.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.190
And just how you can
acquire the skills

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.207
necessary for adult life.

00:03:28.207 --> 00:03:30.040
And those experiences,
I was just wondering,

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.050
why can't this be the
school day itself?

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.300
I'm making so many friends.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.850
I'm enjoying myself.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.380
Why is it that I'm finding
myself to be so bored

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.810
in my regular classes?

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.400
Couldn't there be
a better option?

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.846
And just that basic
curiosity of like,

00:03:44.846 --> 00:03:45.970
could the system be better?

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.350
Like, is there a better
system out there?

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.960
And how can we bring it to
more places, really drove

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.500
my thinking and my research.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.570
So I graduated from high
school in January 2013.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.870
And after that, basically what
I did was go around the country.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.200
I went to cities like Chicago,
Philadelphia, New York, Boston,

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.370
San Francisco.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.150
And I visited something called
democratic progressive and free

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.960
schools.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.800
And these are schools
that are basically

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.940
schools that focus on
self-directed learning.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.660
They believe that
the school should not

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.460
be divorced from the community.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.640
They should be deeply
ingrained with one another.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.930
That adults and students should
have reciprocal relationships.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.360
That there should be some
kind of democratic process.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.340
So in some of these
schools, the students vote

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.330
on school policies in something
called a democratic meeting.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.460
And just a really radical
idea of how education is done.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.370
And it hearkens
back to the idea of

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.950
progressive democratic
education, which

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.969
has been in this country
for a very long time.

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:52.010
Some of you may be familiar
with a man named John

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.230
Dewey, or Maria Montessori.

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.410
And these were the two pioneers
of progressive education

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.680
in the 20th century.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.990
John Dewey with the U
Chicago lab school, and then

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.910
Montessori in
Italy, and a number

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.750
of schools around the
world-- thousands of them.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:16.980
And that was a very big
period in the 20th century.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.380
And in the 1960s, you had this
movement called the free school

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.940
movement, which
basically coincided

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.400
with the anti-war
movement against Vietnam

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.860
War, the civil rights movement,
the feminist movement, student

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:30.910
power movements.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.990
Just a really big time
for transformation,

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.426
revolution, and protest.

00:05:36.426 --> 00:05:38.800
And so one of the overlooked
movements, one of the things

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.110
that's often not mentioned
in the history books,

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.820
is the free school movement.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.930
And the free school
movement was a movement

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.160
that was dedicated to completely
transforming the education

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.630
system from the ground up.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.012
And the person who kind
of led this movement,

00:05:55.012 --> 00:05:56.970
and who kind of inspired
it from the beginning,

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.180
was a man named A.S. Neill.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.900
And A.S. Neill basically
was a British educator

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.600
who was a teacher for
a long period of time

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.510
and was very frustrated
with how education was done.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.830
He dropped out of the teaching
profession many times.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.430
And he was very
alienated by the way

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.090
kids were learning in school
and how they were treated.

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.300
At the time, corporal punishment
was very, very widespread

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.240
in British schools.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.335
And so A.S. Neill
in 1921, he started

00:06:27.335 --> 00:06:29.240
a school called Summerhill.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.080
And Summerhill was a school.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.500
It was first founded in Germany,
and then they moved to England

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.730
a couple years later.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.660
And it remains there today.

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.180
It's going to be celebrating
their 100th anniversary

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.417
in a couple years.

00:06:42.417 --> 00:06:44.750
And this is a school, it was
a very, very radical school

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:45.680
at the time.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.640
Like I mentioned,
this school was--

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.430
they featured
non-compulsory classes.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.840
So students did not have to
necessarily go to class at all

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.680
during their entire
time at school.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.060
There was equal relationships
between students and teachers.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.490
There was democratic process.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.940
So maybe twice a
week, the students

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.760
come together as a
school community and vote

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.080
on school policies.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.695
And then, there's all
this ample time for play.

00:07:09.695 --> 00:07:12.070
I mean, I think one of the
great things about this school

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:13.880
and many of these
free schools is

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.860
that they let children really
truly live out their childhood.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.130
And get to explore and
find their passions

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:23.580
at a very young age as opposed
to chaining them to a desk

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.840
and telling them, you have
to learn this at this time.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.560
You have to read it by this age.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.685
And you have to be able to
accomplish basic skills.

00:07:29.685 --> 00:07:32.268
And the evidence suggests-- I've
been to many of these schools

00:07:32.268 --> 00:07:33.460
and it's not just anecdotal.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.480
But the evidence suggests,
based on a lot of research

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.990
by people like
Peter [INAUDIBLE],

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:38.440
is that the kids
in these schools,

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.020
even though they necessarily
weren't forced to take classes,

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.509
they overwhelmingly
learned the formal--

00:07:43.509 --> 00:07:44.800
they learned the formal skills.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.870
So reading, basic
literacy, writing,

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:51.600
math, numeracy, and so much more
even if they're not forced to.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.690
Because what
happens is that when

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:57.140
you create an environment where
there is a lot of opportunities

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:01.514
for learning, for play,
for peer-to-peer learning

00:08:01.514 --> 00:08:03.680
because there's no age
segregation in these schools.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.138
The older kids and
the younger kids

00:08:05.138 --> 00:08:07.000
intermix and mingle
with each other.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.930
When you have those kinds
of factors and principles

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.910
in place, you create a system
where the kids not only learn

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.760
more efficiently,
but they retain

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.590
the curiosity, the creativity,
the intrinsic motivation,

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:20.830
that I think all
children are born with.

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:23.740
And it's formal
schooling that oftentimes

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:28.730
leads to the depreciation of
that engagement and curiosity.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:31.590
And so what I found-- what
I wanted to do in the book

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:33.210
was do two things.

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:37.110
1, expose and show the problems
with American education

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:39.020
and just conventional
schooling in general.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.861
And then offer this blueprint
of where education is actually

00:08:41.861 --> 00:08:42.360
succeeding.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.070
Where is it being
very effective?

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:48.470
And in the former, I show
a lot of evidence and data

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:51.770
that suggests that-- for
example, student engagement.

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:53.309
The levels of
student engagement,

00:08:53.309 --> 00:08:54.350
if you look at the chart.

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:57.140
Gallup did this study
a couple years ago.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.942
They call it a
school cliff, where

00:08:58.942 --> 00:09:01.150
if you look at students'
engagement from kindergarten

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:03.350
to 12th grade, it
is a downward spiral

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.460
as you go through more
years of schooling.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.560
Curiosity is the same way.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.380
Creativity.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.230
Asking questions.

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:10.490
The number of questions
kids ask decrease as they

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:12.010
go through formal schooling.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.170
Obviously, it's not
necessarily for everyone.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:16.280
Not everyone has
this happen to them.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:21.000
But across the board, this
is a systematic problem.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.540
So I was looking at the problems
of the American schooling

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:24.040
system.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.248
I was looking at the history.

00:09:25.248 --> 00:09:26.530
Where was the system created?

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:28.580
What was the purposes of it?

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.420
And then I wanted to show that
there is another education

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.460
system that's possible.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.290
And there is Montessori schools.

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:37.217
There are Waldorf schools.

00:09:37.217 --> 00:09:39.550
They call them just progressive
schools, the free school

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:40.960
movement.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.710
I mean, there's thousands
of these schools

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:43.780
around the country.

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:46.380
But the big problem is
that a lot of these schools

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:47.440
are private schools.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.730
So they are largely
unaccessible to the population

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:52.460
that arguably needs
it the most, which

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.550
is poor children of color.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:58.530
Which are generally, as you may
have seen, are in the schools

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:00.540
where it's very regimented.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:05.150
There are basically
doing test prep

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:06.650
for six to seven hours a day.

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:09.610
They have to walk in the
hallways with their hands

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:15.130
behind their backs because they
fear that if the student is not

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:18.510
able to cooperate and act in
a disciplined and obedient

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:22.810
fashion, they're not going
be able to do well in life.

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:26.140
The "New York Times" just
showed this video of a teacher

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:28.320
at Success Academy,
a school that's

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.740
predominately for poor
black and brown children,

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.400
harassing a child.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.420
And I think this is
a systematic problem

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:40.790
at many of these schools that
deal with children of color.

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:44.190
So my mission and my
objective with this book

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:46.590
and with my writing
and my reporting

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:48.750
is to show that progressive
education should

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:51.040
be able to reach the
most vulnerable people

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.580
in our society.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.712
And one of the
examples I show is

00:10:54.712 --> 00:10:56.670
there's a group of schools
actually in New York

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:59.445
state called the New York
State Performance Consortium--

00:10:59.445 --> 00:11:00.320
Standards Consortium.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.850
And this is a group of
public progressive schools

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:06.100
that basically have been given
a waiver by New York state

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.890
where they only have to
take one Regents exam, which

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:09.980
is the English one.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.040
And instead of the
other Regents exams,

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:16.220
they get to submit a portfolio
of, say, a science paper

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:20.120
or science project, a
history paper, a math proof.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.160
Really, performance-based
tasks that

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.670
show what a student
can accomplish.

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:26.600
And I arguably think
this is much better

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:30.830
than what any standardized
test can show a student.

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:33.460
And what they find is that
these schools generally

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:36.950
work with a population that has
been disengaged, that is poor,

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:40.610
that is special education
and minority students.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:43.800
And even when you
consider those stats,

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.547
the students do better in
terms of graduation rates.

00:11:46.547 --> 00:11:48.880
They have lower dropout rates,
higher student engagement

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:49.380
rates.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.540
And arguably, they
do better in college

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:55.790
than students in
comparative public schools.

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:58.440
I mean, that's one of the things
I'm looking at in the future.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:02.460
I'm hoping to study that and
study progressive education,

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.370
at least in
communities of color.

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:06.410
And how we can bring
about these changes,

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:09.060
not only in the private system,
but in the public system where

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.770
I think most kids are.

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:14.060
And where I think we need to
see a major transformation.

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:15.920
And I'll just end on this.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.710
One of my ideal
visions for education

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:21.690
is treating the city
and the community

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:24.010
as the classroom itself.

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:26.690
So in the '60s, during
that period of time,

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:30.430
there was a group of schools
called School Without Walls.

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:33.040
And a School Without Walls--
there was one in Philly,

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.860
for example, basically
believed that the community

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:37.310
should be the classroom.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:39.660
So the kids spent
most of their time

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:44.500
in museums, in libraries, in art
galleries, in athletic centers,

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.640
in bakeries, and in all parts
of the community and the city.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.350
And that's where they learned.

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:52.830
They, obviously, did
have some formal classes,

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:56.110
but they learned based on
side-by-side mentorship

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.540
and apprenticeship and
experiential learning.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.170
And it was just
really incredible

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:03.090
because kids who were
formerly disengaged,

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:05.010
kids who were ready
to drop out of school,

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:07.600
came to these places like
the School Without Walls,

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.390
and they became
completely re-energized

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:12.520
by the idea of learning.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.920
So I'd love to see this idea
of a city as a classroom.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:19.330
And I think the writers,
like I mentioned in the '60s,

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:23.630
you have Jonathan Kozol, Herbert
Kohl, John Holt, Paul Goodman.

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:27.280
These ideas were hashed out
and debated very thoroughly

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.700
in the '60s.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:32.480
Between 1968 and
1972, these ideas

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.380
were on the front pages
of the "New York Times."

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.630
So these are not
necessarily new ideas.

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:40.510
I think I update them for
the 21st century society

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:41.770
that we live in.

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:45.250
So I'm looking forward to seeing
how these changes come about.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:47.390
And I think there's another
education system that

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:50.260
is possible if we have
the political will

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:55.680
and we have the movement
coming from parents, educators,

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.680
students, and policy
makers for a more

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:03.290
progressive and democratic
education system.

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:05.870
SUNNI YUEN: So you may be
one of the few people who,

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:10.157
after graduating from high
school, went back to school.

00:14:10.157 --> 00:14:10.990
NIKHIL GOYAL: Right.

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:12.240
SUNNI YUEN: Many schools.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:12.480
NIKHIL GOYAL: Right.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.220
SUNNI YUEN: A whole year of
traveling, going to schools.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.030
You couldn't get enough of it.

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:17.640
NIKHIL GOYAL:
Well, what I wanted

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.290
to do was not go to the
schools that were like mine,

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:24.190
because I found that
to be very depressing.

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:26.860
I mean, if you go to like
any American high school,

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:30.340
the kids are-- either they're
high or they're-- I mean,

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:34.265
they're on some kind of drug,
or they're sleep deprived.

00:14:34.265 --> 00:14:35.140
They're hunched over.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.056
I mean, it's like
zombies, essentially,

00:14:37.056 --> 00:14:38.930
in many of these
high-achieving high schools.

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:40.430
And I didn't want
to see that again.

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:42.420
And I wanted to see,
where are the kids happy?

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:44.880
It's really funny because
I quote this principal

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.900
at the Workshop School
in Philadelphia.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:49.460
It's a progressive school.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:51.210
And one day, there
was the superintendent

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:53.210
of schools in Philly was
touring a school, which

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:57.330
is an amazing, amazing school
for poor kids in West Philly.

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:00.100
And the first thing the
superintendent said,

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.000
oh, the kids are happy.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.030
And then, Simon Hauger, who's
the principal, goes and says,

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:08.340
oh, actually, this guy
goes to schools every day

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.250
and he notices that
kids aren't happy

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:11.996
and they're bored
to death every day.

00:15:11.996 --> 00:15:13.370
And here, he comes
to this school

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:16.700
and the kids are engaged and
very interested in learning.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.670
It's a very stark
contrast to what you see

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:20.780
in most American high schools.

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.500
So yeah, I wanted to see
the other side of this,

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:27.470
and see where the kids are
actually achieving very well.

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:30.110
And I think I found some really
good answers and solutions

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:32.630
that I hope more
people learn about.

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:36.030
SUNNI YUEN: And did you
set off on this school road

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:39.259
trip-- which sounds kind
of like an oxymoron.

00:15:39.259 --> 00:15:40.800
Did you set on this
road trip knowing

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.210
that you wanted to write a
book based on what you found?

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:44.001
NIKHIL GOYAL: Yeah.

00:15:44.001 --> 00:15:47.990
I mean, I wanted to write
about it in some form.

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:52.390
As I went to these schools,
I noticed that-- I mean,

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:53.980
one of my main
purposes was to bring

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:55.690
the ideas of the '60s back.

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:58.930
I wanted to show that
these ideas, that

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.130
what they talked about--
what Kozol and Holt

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:03.700
and [INAUDIBLE] talked
about in the '60s

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:05.640
are very, very
relevant to today.

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:06.890
I quote a lot of these people.

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:08.320
And people are
saying, oh, why are

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.350
you quoting people from
1965, like how are they

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:11.154
even relevant?

00:16:11.154 --> 00:16:13.320
But if you read those books,
it's quite interesting.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:17.240
Because almost word for word,
they're still applicable

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:20.380
to the education system today,
primarily because the system

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:24.820
has largely remained the same
in many forms and structures.

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.411
So yeah, I wanted to do that.

00:16:26.411 --> 00:16:28.160
And I wanted to show
the public that there

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.491
was another way possible.

00:16:30.491 --> 00:16:32.490
SUNNI YUEN: And are you
familiar with AltSchool,

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:35.360
which was formed by-- founded,
I should say, by a former Google

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.280
engineer?

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:37.690
NIKHIL GOYAL: Yeah.

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:39.920
I have not visited one.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.960
I've heard some good
things about it.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:45.496
I've heard some not so
good things about it.

00:16:45.496 --> 00:16:46.870
I would like to
visit one and see

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:48.036
what it's like for a person.

00:16:48.036 --> 00:16:51.262
I usually don't try to judge
a school before I visit it.

00:16:51.262 --> 00:16:52.470
SUNNI YUEN: That's very wise.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:53.860
NIKHIL GOYAL: Yeah.

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:55.610
SUNNI YUEN: So I mean,
the AltSchool model

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:58.541
is supposed to be concentrated
on project-based learning,

00:16:58.541 --> 00:17:00.040
which is something
that you advocate

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.910
very strongly for in your book.

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:05.760
And there's sort of this
other element, which

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.760
is premised on the idea
of building personalized

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.160
curricula for students.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.180
And again, using
data to create-- it's

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:17.099
very contemporary
for millennials,

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:19.099
creating playlists.

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:21.078
So students can just
look at their homework.

00:17:21.078 --> 00:17:23.619
Instead of calling it homework,
they look at their playlists.

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:28.140
And they naturally can build
a project based on that.

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.270
And the idea is
that that can scale.

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:33.720
That model can scale based
on the data that they have.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:37.140
They can model what's optimal
for a given student based

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.750
on their personality and stage.

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:40.360
What are your thoughts on that?

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.375
NIKHIL GOYAL: So I'm all
in favor of tailoring

00:17:43.375 --> 00:17:46.349
an education to the individual.

00:17:46.349 --> 00:17:47.890
I mean, there's been
a lot of worries

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:49.056
about personalized learning.

00:17:49.056 --> 00:17:51.940
Personalized learning sounds
like a really good idea,

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:54.590
but the implementation
has been very shaky,

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:57.130
I find in the past couple years.

00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:00.040
Primarily because
what happens is

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.750
that if personalized
learning just

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:04.390
says, if you're going to
learn this set curriculum,

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:07.890
and you're just going to learn
it however you choose to,

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:11.190
I don't think that's a very big
leap in the right direction.

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.300
I'm all in favor
of kids learning

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.630
what they would like to
and crafting a curriculum

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:17.750
based on those interests.

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:20.080
But if the end goal is
the same curriculum,

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:23.910
then I don't think that's a
very big iteration of the kind

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:26.062
of current system we have.

00:18:26.062 --> 00:18:27.520
But yeah, I would
love to see this.

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:31.799
I mean, it's obviously still
playing out in many schools

00:18:31.799 --> 00:18:32.590
around the country.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:35.020
And I'd love to
see how it's going.

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:36.410
But yeah, that's my big worry.

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:39.466
Because if we're just
trying to meet this one goal

00:18:39.466 --> 00:18:40.840
and you get to
decide however you

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.970
want to-- how to
get to that goal,

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:46.320
I'd take some issue with that.

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.140
A lot of these
progressive schools,

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:50.610
they do have
curriculums available,

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:54.090
but they do let the
kids really work

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:56.535
with the teacher and the
kind of school community

00:18:56.535 --> 00:19:00.490
at large to decide how best--
what's the best topic or what's

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:03.720
the best way to approach
a certain issue that I

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:04.910
want to learn.

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:06.740
So project-based
learning is a great idea.

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:10.017
I think it's practiced
for many, many years.

00:19:10.017 --> 00:19:12.350
But I think one of the things
that we need to consider--

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:14.180
and I think one of
the fatal flaws,

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.870
one of the flaws of the
progressive education community

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:20.110
is oftentimes not realizing
that kids may prefer a more

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:22.550
direct instruction approach.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:25.990
And I think we should have
all options available to kids,

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:28.450
even though project-based
learning tends to be, I find,

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:31.350
more effective and more
engaging for kids who have

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:32.980
been turned off by a school.

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:35.950
But I think we should have as
many options available for kids

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:37.310
in school.

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:39.380
MANUSHI SHAH: So just
continuing on that,

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:42.700
you have seen the progressive
and democratic school success

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.620
with, like the range is usually
in hundreds of students,

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:48.940
considering from
kindergarten to high school.

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:51.320
When you think about
the current education

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.530
system and the current
school districts,

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:55.580
they are in range of
thousands of students.

00:19:55.580 --> 00:20:00.220
If you try to continue this
same model of letting everyone

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.330
vote on decisions,
there will still

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:04.890
be a cohort who is not happy
with the overall decision

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:07.040
because it's such a huge cohort.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.459
So how would you handle that?

00:20:08.459 --> 00:20:09.250
NIKHIL GOYAL: Yeah.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:13.060
So for the first part,
like the big banks,

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:16.230
I would like to
break up the schools,

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:19.045
in terms of making them smaller,
much smaller institutions.

00:20:19.045 --> 00:20:20.420
I mean, there's
a lot of evidence

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:25.770
to show that schools with
under 250 students, or about

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:28.179
300 students, they have
smaller class sizes.

00:20:28.179 --> 00:20:30.720
They have strong relationships
between students and teachers.

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.990
And if you go to most
American high schools,

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:35.220
they are gargantuan
institutions.

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:38.710
I mean, thousands upon
thousands of kids in the school.

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:43.980
And what happens with that
is that the kids are lost.

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:46.600
And they don't have
true relationships

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.390
with teachers and other
students because they're just

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:51.240
being shuffled from
classroom to classroom.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:56.040
And there's not enough time
for that strong relationship

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:56.540
building.

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.847
So I'd love to make schools
much smaller places.

00:20:58.847 --> 00:21:00.430
And a lot of these
progressive schools

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:02.380
are-- I think one of
the successes of them

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:05.710
is because they are
very small institutions.

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:07.450
And that has a lot
to do with funding

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:14.420
and the way school districts
are structured, and taxes.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:17.700
There's a lot of big
obstacles to that.

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:21.240
But I would really like
to see smaller schools.

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.560
So for the second point
for the democratic meeting.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:27.327
Well, what's great about these
schools is that, obviously,

00:21:27.327 --> 00:21:29.160
yeah, there's always
going to be some cohort

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.530
of kids that don't
like the decision,

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:33.810
or some adult who doesn't
like the decision.

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:36.880
So to give an example,
just to show like what

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.860
these kids actually do.

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.590
At the Philly Free
School one of the kids

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:42.760
were interested in walking
barefoot at the school.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:43.880
It's a very small school.

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.370
And so one kid, I think
like a seven-year-old,

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:47.866
wanted to propose it.

00:21:47.866 --> 00:21:49.490
And he brought it to
the school meeting

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:50.990
and people talked about it.

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:52.600
I think they eventually
voted it down.

00:21:55.034 --> 00:21:57.450
But they had this really good
discussion about this issue.

00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:59.600
There were 7-year-olds debating
15-year-olds and adults

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.490
debating each other.

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:02.156
And eventually, they
came to a consensus

00:22:02.156 --> 00:22:04.060
that this wasn't the best idea.

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:07.060
And at this school also,
they have something called--

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.290
it's kind of like a tribunal.

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:10.640
They have a set of rules.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.400
So if a student breaks
a rule, they actually

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.570
go to court in the school.

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:16.910
There's a jury.

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:20.900
I think there's two students
and one adult on this jury.

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:23.660
So for example, I
believe one kid,

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:28.070
he or she accidentally
broke the ceiling fan.

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:32.807
And the student didn't tell
a staff member or anybody

00:22:32.807 --> 00:22:33.390
at the school.

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:36.110
And it was a hazard.

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:39.110
And so they brought the
student up to the meeting.

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:41.030
They allowed the student
to bring in witnesses

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:43.990
or to vouch for their opinion
and say, why did you do this?

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:45.910
Like, what's the penalty?

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:51.485
And they had this really
good discussion about why.

00:22:51.485 --> 00:22:53.360
Letting the kid know
that this was not right,

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.930
that this was kind of
restorative justice.

00:22:55.930 --> 00:23:00.240
That you need to figure out a
way to mend the community back.

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.330
It was a really
amazing interaction

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:06.110
between this seven-year-old,
or whatever age she was,

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:08.520
and these adults
and these students.

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.890
I think restorative justice
is a much better way

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:13.990
to approach school discipline
and punishment as opposed

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:15.950
to zero tolerance policies.

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:20.100
Because zero tolerance
policies disproportionately

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:21.540
affects children of color.

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:24.000
And it actually doesn't
lead to a better outcome.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.120
Because even if you
just suspend a kid,

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:28.290
they don't truly understand
what they did wrong

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:30.690
and how to rectify
their mistake.

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:32.370
And I think that a
lot of these schools

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:35.190
really do a great job
with restorative justice.

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:37.230
And I think a democratic
meeting, obviously

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:40.310
is going to be harder on a scale
if you have thousands of kids.

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:42.360
But I mean, there
is a high school

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.300
I mentioned in the book,
Hanover High School,

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.300
that-- I'm not sure how
many students they have.

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:50.520
But they have students
elect representatives,

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.570
like they have a
student council.

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:55.200
Not like most
American high schools

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.950
where you have a student
government, which

00:23:56.950 --> 00:24:00.590
is really based on
popularity and oftentimes

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:01.490
not very democratic.

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:04.110
And the school
administration kind of

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:06.180
doesn't really care
very much about them.

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:10.140
This school, there is a
very large student council

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:12.300
where they have
this big election

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.530
at the beginning of
the year and they

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:16.207
get to lobby the school board.

00:24:16.207 --> 00:24:17.540
And they have teachers on there.

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:20.240
It's a really amazing
democratic process.

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:23.450
And the kids, they debate
all kinds of issues,

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:27.310
from homework
policy, to testing,

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:29.530
to installing water
fountain, things like that.

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:31.440
It's a really
interesting democratic--

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.310
in a democratic fashion.

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:35.730
So yeah, I'd love to see
that happen in more schools.

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:39.690
MANUSHI SHAH: But isn't the
number of issues that arise,

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:40.450
is getting higher.

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:42.680
So how do you handle those?

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:46.410
When you consider each issue
that 7-year-old to 20-year-old

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:48.110
is going to bring
up in [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:48.901
NIKHIL GOYAL: Yeah.

00:24:48.901 --> 00:24:50.300
No, it's a good question.

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.980
So the example of Summerhill
School, for example.

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:56.310
They actually have something
called ombudsman and beddies

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:57.480
officers.

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.930
This is a boarding school.

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:03.190
So an ombudsman is essentially
a student who is elected.

00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:07.060
The individual has been at the
school for at least two years.

00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:09.100
They're usually
an older student.

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:12.110
And an ombudsman
basically is charged

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:14.960
with settling small
disputes between students.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.480
And oftentimes, it's
between younger students.

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.660
Just fighting, or somebody
called each other a name,

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:22.080
like a small, little thing.

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.130
An ombudsman, who's
an older kid who

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:26.880
is charged with
settling that dispute,

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:30.150
with making sure that the
tedious, minor disputes don't

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:32.549
go into the school meeting.

00:25:32.549 --> 00:25:33.840
And they have beddies officers.

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.590
So at this school,
it's a boarding school,

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:39.370
beddies officers wake
up and put kids to bed.

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:42.600
It's to make sure that they are
not running around at night.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.550
And there is amazing--

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:47.670
I think because older kids
take on that responsibility,

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:50.160
the community
functions a lot better.

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.770
And not every case makes it to
the school meeting necessarily.

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:57.020
The chair, or the person who's
coordinating the meeting,

00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:59.570
has to decide whether
this is reasonable

00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:01.770
or we can decide this
in another fashion.

00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:04.170
So I think there is kind
of structures in place

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:06.550
to ensure that it
doesn't get cobbled down

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:11.190
by a lot of unnecessary cases.

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:13.620
SUNNI YUEN: So let's talk tests.

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:16.420
It is the one thing I've left
behind for good, hopefully.

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:18.540
Maybe not.

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:22.900
But you actually distinguish
at length the difference

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:24.886
between a test
and an assessment.

00:26:24.886 --> 00:26:26.260
In your book, you
say that a test

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.360
is used to tell whether
a student has memorized

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:32.100
and regurgitated [INAUDIBLE]
material, while an assessment

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:35.850
is an ongoing process for
evaluating, documenting,

00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:37.280
and reflecting.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:40.980
And so I am curious, because
it seems like your distinction

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:44.760
and your arguments here hinge
on two distinct aspects.

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:49.410
1, which is format of a test
and the purpose of a test.

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:54.000
And I think anybody here who
has had to deal with a number 2

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.270
pencil and a Scantron sheet can
probably say that at some point

00:26:57.270 --> 00:27:00.460
they've taken a multiple choice
test which was only created

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:02.510
to test superficial knowledge.

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:04.580
And also, it was summative.

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:06.820
It was meant for the
purpose of determining

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:09.040
what the final grade was.

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:13.550
But is there any reason why
a test can't be actually

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:18.722
formative and a good gauge
of a student's development?

00:27:18.722 --> 00:27:19.680
NIKHIL GOYAL: Yeah, no.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.090
Really good question.

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:24.150
Well, I distinguish
between the two just

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:27.630
for the purposes
of this argument.

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:29.290
And this is a term,
I think-- I mean,

00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:33.040
I find that progressive schools,
they don't use the term "test"

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:33.540
necessarily.

00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:35.140
They use the term "assessment."

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:39.100
And assessment is more so-- I
mean, performance-based tests

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:41.670
or portfolio-based assessment.

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:43.920
And that's what I think the
distinguishing factor is.

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:45.961
Like a traditional
standardized test and multiple

00:27:45.961 --> 00:27:48.730
choice are based
on memorization.

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:52.040
But I think, yeah.

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:56.180
I think there is a lot
of debate and discussion

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:57.945
around this issue.

00:27:57.945 --> 00:28:00.320
I mean, there are some-- I
mean, one of the things that's

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.278
kind of thing and I didn't
mention in this book

00:28:02.278 --> 00:28:03.360
because it just happened.

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.000
President Obama just signed the
Every Student Succeeds Act back

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.340
in December.

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:09.680
And one of the things-- and
they use this language also,

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:10.830
I believe.

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:16.720
They say that schools can
move-- some states are allowed

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:20.910
to move away from traditional
standardized tests towards more

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:22.510
performance-based assessments.

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:25.390
So like, that's where I think
the language is more so used.

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:28.930
So they can use portfolios,
or performance-based tests,

00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:33.140
or experiential
learning methods.

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:36.030
It's more so different than a
traditional standardized test.

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:38.010
So I just think that's
kind of the language

00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:39.610
that people are
using these days.

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:41.735
SUNNI YUEN: So how do you
feel about spelling bees?

00:28:41.735 --> 00:28:42.980
Do they need to go?

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:45.550
NIKHIL GOYAL: Well,
I mean, I have

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:47.180
nothing against spelling bees.

00:28:49.895 --> 00:28:52.270
Yeah, I mean, feel free to
participate in a spelling bee.

00:28:54.762 --> 00:28:56.720
SUNNI YUEN: But do you
think that they are only

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.810
meant to test regurgitation?

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:01.870
NIKHIL GOYAL: I mean, it depends
on the way you approach it.

00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:05.520
Because I mean, a
lot of times it does.

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.024
There's a lot of evidence.

00:29:07.024 --> 00:29:09.440
I mean, I've heard stories of
kids who do the spelling bee

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:13.150
and they use a very rea-llife
application base to it.

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:17.364
They find contractual
ways to learn those words

00:29:17.364 --> 00:29:19.780
without necessarily just kind
of cramming the information.

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:21.450
I mean, like one of
the things I mention.

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:23.520
I mean, similar not
necessarily in spelling bees,

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.130
but the issue of
rote memorization.

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:30.380
And I think, like the evidence
around acquiring and retaining

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:31.420
information.

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:32.795
I mean, there's
a lot of evidence

00:29:32.795 --> 00:29:34.211
around project-based
learning that

00:29:34.211 --> 00:29:36.100
shows that project-based
learning actually

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:41.770
leads to long-term retention
because you're repeating

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:42.990
the task over and over again.

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:45.930
And you're solidifying
the information

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:47.660
with the real-life applications.

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:49.745
So it has a real meaning
to you as opposed to you

00:29:49.745 --> 00:29:51.350
just kind of did
this at one time.

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:53.713
You studied for the
test and this is it.

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:59.440
I think I personally find that
the project-based learning

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.017
experiences that
I've had in school,

00:30:01.017 --> 00:30:03.100
like the afterschool
programs, I can remember that

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:05.750
very vividly today, where
I can't very much remember

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:08.980
most of what I learned in
chemistry class in 10th grade.

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:13.480
So I'd love to see that
happen in more schools.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.660
SUNNI YUEN: Now, there
are two testing consortia

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:19.570
that have arosen out of
the Common Core work, which

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:21.560
is the Partnership
for Assessment

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:24.560
Readiness for College and
Careers and Smarter Balanced.

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.730
And these are consortia which
are focused on developing tests

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:30.130
that assess critical thinking
and pathways to improvement

00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:32.350
rather than just
rote memorization.

00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:34.360
Do you think that they're
on the right track

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:37.150
to revolutionize
standardized testing in a way

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:41.160
that it could be formative
rather than simply summative?

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:43.960
NIKHIL GOYAL: Well, I
have not studied PARCC.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.016
I believe it's PARCC
you're referring to?

00:30:46.016 --> 00:30:47.390
I have not studied
that in-depth.

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:52.169
But what I've heard from parents
is that there is a lot-- and as

00:30:52.169 --> 00:30:53.710
well as many educators,
there's a lot

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:58.730
of concern about the way PARCC
is implementing their tests.

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:00.730
Again, I have not studied
PARCC very in-depth,

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:02.605
but I've just heard many
concerns about that.

00:31:06.049 --> 00:31:07.590
Under the Every
Student Succeeds Act,

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:09.330
there is, I think,
seven states that

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:12.740
are allowed to move away
from standardized tests,

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:14.110
like the traditional forms.

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:16.150
So I think that's
really good progress.

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:18.980
I'd love to see that
happen on a larger scale.

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:20.650
But the other issue
is accountability

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:23.185
in terms of what these
tests are used for.

00:31:23.185 --> 00:31:27.290
I find it very concerning
when tests are used

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:32.360
to assess and fire teachers.

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:36.230
And also, along the
lines of grading schools.

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:38.920
Because when you find-- I
mean, a lot of these tests

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:42.880
are very much so based on
socioeconomic indicators.

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:45.980
I mean, there's a lot of studies
to show that teachers have

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:50.330
a very small portion
of the control over how

00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:52.900
well a student does.

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:54.880
Kids in high-achieving
communities

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.760
generally do better
on standardized tests

00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:58.760
for a number of reasons.

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:03.460
One is that the culture
of and the language used

00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:05.900
on these tests is more
resembling a more white

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:07.410
middle-class environment.

00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:11.070
Whereas, a poor kid is probably
not going to get as much

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:14.370
of success on these tests
for a number of reasons

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:17.540
because of their
socioeconomic background.

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:20.900
So I think standardized tests
have a strong correlation.

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:23.550
And the SAT is a
perfect example.

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:27.880
If you look at family income
as you go up the brackets,

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:29.590
the standardized
test scores go up

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:34.080
and the SAT scores go
up in an upward fashion.

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:39.380
So yeah, I think
there's a lot of-- I'm

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:41.480
hopeful to see the
changes that are happening

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.849
under Every Student
Succeeds, but I do worry

00:32:43.849 --> 00:32:45.640
about the kind of
accountability structures

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:49.650
that may result from that.

00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:51.780
Teachers have been very,
very angry about this.

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:54.820
I mean, they've protested in
numbers around the country

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:57.470
around, they call them
value-added evaluations,

00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:00.530
where the teacher is
basically evaluated

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:03.420
based on the kid's test score.

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:06.095
And they can get fired for that.

00:33:06.095 --> 00:33:08.470
SUNNI YUEN: But that's part
of your criticism of the Race

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:10.060
to the Top program, right?

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:11.490
Where I think in
your book you had

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:14.190
mentioned that the $4 billion
program passed as part

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:16.200
of the stimulus package.

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:20.987
You said you felt that because
of the size of the stimulus,

00:33:20.987 --> 00:33:23.070
and at a time when it was
granted during the Great

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:25.751
Recession a few years ago, that
it was basically strong-arming

00:33:25.751 --> 00:33:26.250
states--

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:27.030
NIKHIL GOYAL: Nobody
knew about it.

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:29.446
SUNNI YUEN: --to comply with
policies promoted by the Race

00:33:29.446 --> 00:33:30.490
to the Top [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:33.920
But the thing is that out
of the initial tier that

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.684
was provided under the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act,

00:33:36.684 --> 00:33:38.350
of the $100 billion,
$50 billion of that

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:41.210
was actually dedicated and
earmarked to save teacher jobs.

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:42.380
So how do you address that?

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:42.650
NIKHIL GOYAL: Yeah.

00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:43.370
No.

00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:44.665
So first thing.

00:33:44.665 --> 00:33:48.930
Race to the Top, it was a piece
of legislation, a $4.35 billion

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:52.510
program started by
Arne Duncan, who

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:55.040
was the CEO of Chicago schools.

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.750
And the stimulus
package-- I mean,

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:59.931
this was a massive package.

00:33:59.931 --> 00:34:01.680
As a person who was
involved in education,

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:04.560
as a person who follows
education news, and talking

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:06.540
to people who were very
active at that time,

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:08.530
did not know about
Race to the Top.

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:12.230
This was not a program
that was very well-known

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:13.750
in the education community.

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:16.690
And that's why there wasn't
this kind of opposition to it

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:18.110
from that forefront.

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:20.021
In terms of the firing
and hiring teachers.

00:34:20.021 --> 00:34:20.520
Yeah, no.

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.739
I think there's a lot
of really good-- it did

00:34:22.739 --> 00:34:24.330
save a lot of teachers' jobs.

00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:29.550
But what I'm referring to is
the value-added evaluations,

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:32.075
which have-- basically, ,
under a Race to the Top,

00:34:32.075 --> 00:34:34.610
a state had to abide
by certain principles.

00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:37.620
So one of them was the
Common Core standards.

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:40.052
Another one was implementing
more charter schools.

00:34:40.052 --> 00:34:41.260
SUNNI YUEN: Though, actually.

00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:42.820
I think Race to the
Top program never

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:45.065
actually, by its terms, required
the adoption of the Common

00:34:45.065 --> 00:34:45.310
Core.

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:46.726
NIKHIL GOYAL: It
doesn't say that.

00:34:46.726 --> 00:34:48.600
SUNNI YUEN: It encouraged
states to develop

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:51.329
standards, which is not exactly
the same as Common Core.

00:34:51.329 --> 00:34:52.870
NIKHIL GOYAL: It
did say Common Core.

00:34:52.870 --> 00:34:54.370
I'm pretty sure it
said Common Core.

00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:55.130
SUNNI YUEN: No.

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:58.610
NIKHIL GOYAL: But my point is
that they strong armed states

00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:01.410
into pushing for
these-- Arne Duncan

00:35:01.410 --> 00:35:05.300
was a proponent of
these standards.

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:09.080
He was a strong supporter of
these standards at the time.

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:10.386
But here's my point.

00:35:10.386 --> 00:35:13.804
My point is, is that the
stimulus, obviously, did

00:35:13.804 --> 00:35:14.970
a lot of really good things.

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:17.080
It saved a lot of jobs.

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.300
But in New York
state, for example,

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:21.800
they did pass-- they were one
of the states that did receive

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:22.883
the Race to the Top money.

00:35:22.883 --> 00:35:26.260
And they did implement
value-added evaluations.

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:28.870
And it's caused a lot of
upheaval by educators.

00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:31.177
It's massive dissatisfaction
with that system.

00:35:31.177 --> 00:35:32.760
Like I said, there's
a lot of evidence

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.990
to show that standardized
test scores are very much

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:37.130
so tied to teacher evaluations.

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:39.850
I mean, on the issue of
firing and hiring teachers,

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:45.200
early in Obama's term in 2009,
I believe it was Central Falls.

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.940
It was a very poor
Rhode Island district.

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:50.590
They fired all their teachers
or most of their staff.

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:52.909
And Obama and Duncan
supported that measure.

00:35:52.909 --> 00:35:54.450
I mean, they were
totally behind that

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:57.477
because they found that
this school district was

00:35:57.477 --> 00:35:58.310
very low-performing.

00:35:58.310 --> 00:36:02.100
And there was massive backlash
from the teachers union.

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:04.370
I read about that, Central
Falls in Rhode Island.

00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:06.200
So yes, they did save jobs.

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:11.374
But a lot of educators have been
very critical of those changes.

00:36:11.374 --> 00:36:13.540
SUNNI YUEN: So maybe it was
an implementation issue?

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:14.331
NIKHIL GOYAL: Yeah.

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:18.690
I mean, my thing
is, if you're going

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:20.270
to talk about education
policy, you're

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:21.530
going to have to
include the stakeholders

00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:22.440
in that conversation.

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:26.370
They did not have enough of an
effort to include the educators

00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:27.030
and students.

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:29.500
People I know did not
know about Race to the Top

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:30.880
until it was passed.

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.810
It was not something
that was very well-known.

00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:34.101
Maybe that's part of the media.

00:36:34.101 --> 00:36:36.290
Maybe it was part
of the strategy.

00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:38.450
But I don't think
it was developed

00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:43.754
in a way that necessarily was as
cohesive as it could have been.

00:36:43.754 --> 00:36:45.170
MANUSHI SHAH: So
just getting back

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:49.640
to the whole idea of letting
students learn by themselves,

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.829
you're assuming that
inherently they are just

00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:53.870
going to be interested in
learning by themselves,

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:56.970
even at the age
of three or four,

00:36:56.970 --> 00:37:01.100
which is when they're most
curious about things in life.

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:04.140
How do you intend
to force students

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:05.160
who are not interested?

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:08.730
Like by the age of
11 or 12, they just

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:10.360
don't want to learn anything.

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:13.200
If you give them a choice
of playing video games

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:15.325
and watching TV,
they might just defer

00:37:15.325 --> 00:37:17.730
to that instead of learning
or doing any projects.

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:18.730
So would you force them?

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:20.320
NIKHIL GOYAL: It's a
very good question.

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:21.278
So here's what I'd say.

00:37:21.278 --> 00:37:24.150
So first of all,
children-- I mean,

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:25.400
children are natural learners.

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:27.160
You go to any preschool.

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:29.240
I mean, children
are deeply engaged

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:31.630
in the practice of learning.

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:35.800
And play, I argue,
is a very strong form

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:40.190
of learning, at least
in the early ages.

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:43.500
I give the example of
the Brooklyn Free School,

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:46.380
like talking about video
games and television.

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:49.770
The Brooklyn Free School,
it's a private school

00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:51.550
with sliding scale tuition.

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:56.440
I believe large
population of color.

00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:00.620
They do offer a certain number
of families free tuition.

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:03.830
So they do have economic
diversity in that form.

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:05.210
And the school,
one of the things

00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:07.250
I was wondering, like, yeah,
it's a really good question,

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:09.335
where if you just let a
kid, kind of sit around,

00:38:09.335 --> 00:38:11.960
do whatever they want, are they
just going to play video games?

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:14.559
And what you find
is that the kids who

00:38:14.559 --> 00:38:16.850
came from traditional schools,
they come to this school

00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:18.690
and they see all this freedom.

00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:21.340
Basically, they gravitate
towards the things that were

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:22.980
basically controlled before.

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:24.230
So they go to the video games.

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:25.030
They play video games.

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:25.880
They watch television.

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:26.879
They're on the computer.

00:38:26.879 --> 00:38:28.210
They watch YouTube.

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:30.610
They're not doing anything
that's so-called "productive"

00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:31.440
in your sense.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:35.640
But what you find-- I give
this story of one student

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:36.570
named Louise.

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:38.520
And she did that for
maybe a couple of months.

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:39.978
She was just sitting
around and she

00:38:39.978 --> 00:38:43.210
was very-- she was completely
isolated from everyone else.

00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:46.890
And what happened
was that she realized

00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:51.129
because of everyone else around
her was engaging in learning.

00:38:51.129 --> 00:38:52.420
They were going on field trips.

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:54.550
They were doing
volunteer opportunities.

00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:56.240
There were classes available.

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.690
Everyone else was engaged
in some kind of activity.

00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:00.300
And she was just left alone.

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:01.990
It was just kind
of peer pressure

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:05.110
where she wanted to be part
of the school community.

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:08.180
And the students actually
call it a period of detox.

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:09.820
They literally
call it that term,

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:13.830
where you have to kind
on unlearn and relearn

00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:16.010
what you're most interested in.

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:18.380
And that process can take
a very, very long time.

00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:20.045
Because if you just
throw a kid into

00:39:20.045 --> 00:39:22.420
an unstructured environment
from a structure environment,

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:24.905
it's going to take a very
long time for that transition

00:39:24.905 --> 00:39:26.490
to happen.

00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:29.881
So yeah, I think
the kids do learn.

00:39:29.881 --> 00:39:32.380
And they go through that period
of detox, which is, I think,

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:33.417
very important.

00:39:33.417 --> 00:39:35.000
I have not seen a
case of that school,

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.300
for example, that has--
they've just been left alone

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.670
and not done any classes.

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:44.640
But Summerhill is also
a very good example,

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.530
where I find the
kids, many kids,

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:49.560
don't take a single
formal lesson

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:51.880
until 12 or 13 years old.

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:53.690
For six, seven
years, they have not

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:55.120
taken a single formal lesson.

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:57.130
Yet, the kids have
learned how to read.

00:39:57.130 --> 00:39:59.255
They've learned how to read
through computer games.

00:39:59.255 --> 00:40:00.460
For example, "Minecraft."

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:02.380
Many kids learn reading
through "Minecraft."

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:04.910
They work through play.

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:09.562
Or an older kid helped them out
with the words and the letters

00:40:09.562 --> 00:40:10.770
and they learned how to read.

00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:12.770
Or, through other [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:15.890
Or they may have taken a
formal lesson at some point.

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:18.230
Yet, they've learned how to
read and do basic literacy

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:21.520
and numeracy by that point.

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:25.480
And then at that time, there
is this kind of realization

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:27.540
amongst the student
population that I

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:30.290
need to begin to, so-called
"formally prepare" a little bit

00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:33.290
for college or adult life.

00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:34.740
And they begin to take classes.

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:37.200
I mean, I have not seen
a case when I was there

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:40.780
for all the kids who were
in, like the 13 to 15

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:43.130
demographic, who
weren't taking classes

00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:45.040
or who weren't preparing
for something called

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:48.190
the GCSE exams for college.

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:51.960
So yeah, I think if you
have a community where there

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:55.600
is enough and ample
opportunities for learning,

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:58.890
and there are these kinds
of structures in place

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:03.260
to encourage kids to take
on a more formal lesson.

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:08.830
I mean, kids are not completely
resistant to what adults think.

00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:13.050
I mean, they're oftentimes
very intelligent human beings.

00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:14.855
If you encourage them
and if you show them

00:41:14.855 --> 00:41:16.730
that here are some really
good opportunities,

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:18.710
then they will take them.

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:22.200
So yeah, I would love to see
more research done on this.

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:25.320
A lot of this is,
unfortunately, very anecdotal.

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:28.340
But yeah, I would love to see
more research on this issue.

00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:29.900
MANUSHI SHAH: But
in that case, it's

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:32.640
usually when you have
progressive school already

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:34.420
in place, where
there are a hundred

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:36.220
kids who are learning this way.

00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:38.580
And then you put two
or three students

00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:41.450
from traditional school who
will just follow this idea.

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:45.050
But you can't just change
the whole structure

00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:48.810
and expect them to
be just-- undo that.

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:49.920
NIKHIL GOYAL: Right.

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:50.880
It's a good question.

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:51.790
It's a good point.

00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:53.840
What I would say is that
I think the solution is

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:57.784
to start pilot programs within
existing schools themselves.

00:41:57.784 --> 00:42:00.200
So a lot of these schools,
they have alternative education

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:00.980
programs.

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:02.527
In Great Neck on
Long Island, they

00:42:02.527 --> 00:42:05.110
have the Village School, which
is an alternative school that's

00:42:05.110 --> 00:42:06.430
been around for decades.

00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:10.070
So you create these kinds
of progressive programs

00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:13.004
within the existing school
buildings themselves,

00:42:13.004 --> 00:42:14.420
and then you work
on expanding it.

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:15.930
Because I'd love
to see this-- you

00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:18.180
try this out with, say, a
group of kids who are really

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:19.221
interested in doing this.

00:42:19.221 --> 00:42:21.240
And then you expand it
to more and more kids.

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:23.432
Or, you try what the
consortium schools are like

00:42:23.432 --> 00:42:25.140
and you work with that
kind of population

00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:27.990
of students who have been
very disengaged by schools.

00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:31.730
But I think a pilot program
is a much better option.

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:35.270
There's a school
in Massachusetts

00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:38.010
that started something called
the Independent Project.

00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:40.730
And this was a group of 10
high school students who

00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:45.120
wanted to be able to
get away from the rules

00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:47.360
and the requirements
that are required

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:49.310
of them in the
traditional school day.

00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:51.310
And so they wanted to
work on their own project.

00:42:51.310 --> 00:42:53.810
They decided, let's create our
own school within the school.

00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:56.820
Let's have a couple of teachers
and mentors available to us.

00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:57.636
And they did this.

00:42:57.636 --> 00:43:00.260
And I think something like that
model, the Independent Project,

00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:02.700
which has been around
for a couple years now,

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:03.730
can start in schools.

00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:05.895
So yes, you're right
that if you just do this,

00:43:05.895 --> 00:43:08.270
you're not going to necessarily
lead to the best results.

00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:09.978
But if you start with
a group of students

00:43:09.978 --> 00:43:12.100
and you slowly expand
that over time,

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:16.360
I think that can lead to
better outcomes in the future.

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:19.440
SUNNI YUEN: So what is this
magic, sort of age or epiphany,

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:21.920
when students who have gone
through a very unstructured

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:24.880
environment suddenly
decide, oh, I

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:26.552
want to study nuclear physics.

00:43:26.552 --> 00:43:29.010
So I'm going to have to develop
a core set of competencies,

00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:29.240
right?

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:30.830
Because if you
look at it, there's

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:34.110
the adult world, which I
think everybody in this room

00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:36.180
falls into.

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:40.000
But you know, what about doctors
having to take the boards?

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.500
Do we get rid of
boards for doctors?

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:44.080
Do they need to be
qualified by taking an exam?

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:46.370
Should lawyers like me
have to take a bar exam?

00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:47.630
Why?

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:49.250
What about accountants,
architects?

00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:52.560
And even in education, I
think the dean of U Michigan's

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:54.560
education school had said
that there needs to be

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:56.810
a common set of standards.

00:43:56.810 --> 00:43:59.360
And so the question is
sort of like, how do you

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:01.210
manage that
transition from going

00:44:01.210 --> 00:44:06.180
from very individual,
project-based-driven learning

00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:10.530
into sort of like where you've
got a very structured world?

00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:14.130
Where the threshold to
even become an architect,

00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:15.950
to become a
chartered accountant,

00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:17.139
you have to take tests.

00:44:17.139 --> 00:44:18.930
And they're going to
be standardized tests.

00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:21.090
And they're going to be
hard and time-pressured.

00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:25.510
And if you don't have that sort
of practice going through K

00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:27.760
through 12 at some
point, you're just

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:29.097
not going to be that prepared.

00:44:29.097 --> 00:44:31.430
Does that mean we should
invite the Kaplans of the world

00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:32.854
to take over that role?

00:44:32.854 --> 00:44:34.520
NIKHIL GOYAL: It's a
very good question.

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:39.360
So what I find is that the kids
in these progressive schools,

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:43.740
they actually have a very easy
time transitioning to college.

00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:45.380
I mean, obviously
those are examples.

00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:47.900
And I'm not in favor of
getting rid of these board

00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:50.967
exams or requirements for--

00:44:50.967 --> 00:44:51.800
SUNNI YUEN: Doctors.

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:52.883
NIKHIL GOYAL: For doctors.

00:44:52.883 --> 00:44:58.384
I don't think that's even
part of this solution.

00:44:58.384 --> 00:45:00.050
If I just may mention,
one of the things

00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:02.560
that they are-- I was
reading at medical schools

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:05.272
is that they are trying to
move to more qualitative

00:45:05.272 --> 00:45:06.230
measures of assessment.

00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:07.990
Because they're
finding that they

00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:10.130
want to show the
multi-dimensional facets

00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:10.970
of an individual.

00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:11.678
SUNNI YUEN: Yeah.

00:45:11.678 --> 00:45:12.920
But that's a school versus--

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:13.300
NIKHIL GOYAL: I know.

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:13.640
SUNNI YUEN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:14.370
NIKHIL GOYAL: That's my point.

00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:16.578
My point is I think they're
moving in that direction.

00:45:16.578 --> 00:45:18.950
But my point is, is
that the students--

00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:21.729
I find that they have
no difficulty taking

00:45:21.729 --> 00:45:22.520
standardized tests.

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:26.050
At Summerhill, the kids take
many GCSE exams for college.

00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:28.090
These are standardized exams.

00:45:28.090 --> 00:45:30.010
And they find that
in college, even

00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:31.940
if they're structured
environments,

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:37.490
the kids don't mind being there
because they chose to be there.

00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:39.330
And they chose to
be in that class,

00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:41.860
or they prefer that kind
of style of learning.

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:44.870
So I don't find that they
have any difficulty adapting

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:45.820
to that environment.

00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:48.850
They actually say that the
kids who were kind of forced

00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:51.524
into that, who never had the
practice of choosing what they

00:45:51.524 --> 00:45:53.940
wanted to learn or taking more
responsibility in learning,

00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:57.740
have difficulty going into
those college classes.

00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:04.070
So yeah, I think there
is a lot of evidence that

00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:06.480
shows that even kids
in progressive schools

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:10.110
can do the more structured
standardized learning.

00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:12.450
And they do well in
college and later on.

00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:15.260
I mean, you gave me the
example of doctors and lawyers.

00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:17.920
And maybe those are
extreme examples.

00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:20.180
They're like examples
of certain professions

00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:22.190
where there is more
standardization required

00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:23.300
of you.

00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:25.920
But there's doctors and lawyers
that come out of these schools

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:26.420
as well.

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:30.956
So I think they can take
on those challenges.

00:46:30.956 --> 00:46:33.080
SUNNI YUEN: But do you
think they're disadvantaged?

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:33.800
NIKHIL GOYAL: I don't think--

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:35.175
SUNNI YUEN:
[INAUDIBLE] pure fact

00:46:35.175 --> 00:46:38.040
that they haven't had as much
practice at an earlier stage?

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:40.930
NIKHIL GOYAL: Well,
obviously if you're

00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:42.560
driven in test prep
your entire life,

00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:44.360
you're going to be
good at taking tests.

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:45.270
SUNNI YUEN: That's exactly it.

00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:46.519
NIKHIL GOYAL: That's my point.

00:46:46.519 --> 00:46:51.580
I think that that's not
the only thing in life.

00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:54.320
I think that's not the
only thing that's-- yes,

00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:58.010
you do need to take tests to get
into medical school and become

00:46:58.010 --> 00:46:59.540
a doctor and such.

00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:01.420
But there are
other things that I

00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:04.020
think are also very important
qualities that we should

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:05.359
want to see in human beings.

00:47:05.359 --> 00:47:07.650
SUNNI YUEN: So do you think
testing should be done only

00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:08.620
at a final stage?

00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:10.730
Anybody can go to med school.

00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:12.871
Don't evaluate them
based on tests,

00:47:12.871 --> 00:47:14.620
but wait till they
just take their boards.

00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:16.110
Let the boards be
the final stage.

00:47:16.110 --> 00:47:18.652
NIKHIL GOYAL: I have not studied
medical school, so I can't--

00:47:18.652 --> 00:47:19.276
SUNNI YUEN: OK.

00:47:19.276 --> 00:47:20.720
I'm just using it as an example.

00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:20.830
NIKHIL GOYAL: Right.

00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:20.960
No.

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:21.600
SUNNI YUEN: What is
a right [INAUDIBLE]?

00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:23.500
NIKHIL GOYAL: I'm
looking at K-12.

00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:26.620
So I mean, I think
there-- I have not

00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:31.100
studied the practice
of law or medicine,

00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:32.150
so I can't speak on that.

00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:35.320
But in terms of the
K-12 system, yeah, I'm

00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:38.040
all in favor of having--
these progressive schools,

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:40.110
the public progressive
schools in New York,

00:47:40.110 --> 00:47:42.170
they have regular
performance-based tests,

00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:43.920
checking out what the
kids are working on.

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:46.700
And if you're in a small school,
you don't even necessarily

00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:47.460
need those tests.

00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:48.980
If you have a
strong relationship

00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:50.479
and the teacher
knows where you are,

00:47:50.479 --> 00:47:52.860
the teacher can
individually determine where

00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:54.390
you stand on a certain subject.

00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:57.260
And they can mark where you are.

00:47:57.260 --> 00:47:59.870
That's, obviously, a
very ideal situation.

00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:02.020
But yeah, I mean,
there's nothing wrong

00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:04.222
with having a few
assessments here and there

00:48:04.222 --> 00:48:04.930
in these schools.

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:06.340
And they do so.

00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:10.500
MANUSHI SHAH: So
just to conclude,

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:13.714
you're saying that K
through 12 public schools,

00:48:13.714 --> 00:48:15.630
progressive schools and
democratic make sense.

00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:17.880
But undergrad or
grad, or anything

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:21.270
after, you would
keep the way it is?

00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:23.419
NIKHIL GOYAL: Well, I'm
not saying I'd necessarily

00:48:23.419 --> 00:48:24.210
keep the way it is.

00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:29.280
I have just not studied
the grad system as much.

00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:31.940
But I find that a lot of
graduate schools, at least

00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:34.680
in-- I mean, I haven't studied
the American system very much.

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:37.080
But the UK system, there
are very few tests.

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:39.790
A lot of it is very
based on submitting

00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:43.335
essays, and research,
and the work you do.

00:48:43.335 --> 00:48:44.626
At least in the humanities.

00:48:44.626 --> 00:48:45.440
SUNNI YUEN: And oral exams.

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:45.800
NIKHIL GOYAL: Yeah.

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:46.560
SUNNI YUEN: And oral exams.

00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:47.150
NIKHIL GOYAL: And
oral exams, yeah.

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:49.483
At Oxford and Cambridge,
that's essentially what you do.

00:48:49.483 --> 00:48:50.330
You have oral exams.

00:48:50.330 --> 00:48:53.420
And I mean, Oxford and Cambridge
have the tutorial system

00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:54.640
where you have a tutor.

00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:56.100
You go to that tutor.

00:48:56.100 --> 00:49:00.300
It's like one-on-one instruction
and a very individual-based

00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:01.450
approach.

00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:03.960
And yeah, I think an oral
exam is a much better way

00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:05.530
to tell whether
you know something

00:49:05.530 --> 00:49:08.110
as opposed to taking
a standardized test

00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:11.520
or a traditional test.

00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:17.030
I mean, I'd love to see more
oral exams to happen in school.

00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.659
Yeah.

00:49:17.659 --> 00:49:19.700
Again, that's maybe another
topic for the future.

00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:23.340
But K-12, I think that's
what I'd like to see.

00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:24.510
MANUSHI SHAH: OK.

00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:36.250
We can also open the
floor for any Q&amp;A.

00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:37.650
AUDIENCE: Nikhil, thank you.

00:49:37.650 --> 00:49:39.780
It was really an
amazing discussion.

00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:40.630
I enjoyed it.

00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:42.180
I had this question
to you talking

00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:46.110
about the democratic
process in schools.

00:49:46.110 --> 00:49:49.440
But who decides
whether students need

00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:53.590
to go to this kind of school
or to another kind of process?

00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:57.310
Is this the role of parents,
districts, federal government?

00:49:57.310 --> 00:49:58.060
What do you think?

00:49:58.060 --> 00:49:58.970
NIKHIL GOYAL: Yeah.

00:49:58.970 --> 00:50:01.660
Well, most democrat schools,
as I mentioned, are private.

00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:06.460
So that's obviously a
parent's decision to do that.

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:08.760
But there are these
alternative schools.

00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:11.510
The problem with the alternative
schools is that a lot of them

00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:15.160
are oftentimes only
reserved for kids

00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:18.890
who are in special
education or are

00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:20.844
completely disengaged
or ready to drop out.

00:50:20.844 --> 00:50:22.510
They're not necessarily
for the kids who

00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:28.520
are just going by school getting
A's, B's, C. Just going by.

00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:31.870
So that's often a
district or a teacher

00:50:31.870 --> 00:50:34.900
recommends a student to
go into this program.

00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:36.890
But yeah, a lot
of it is parents.

00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:39.230
I think an individual
district can decide

00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:40.570
to set up a progressive school.

00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:42.340
So the Workshop
School, for example,

00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:47.410
is a school that was founded
by Simon Hauger and a couple

00:50:47.410 --> 00:50:49.305
other people in 2013.

00:50:49.305 --> 00:50:50.680
And it was sanctioned
by a school

00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:51.850
district of Philadelphia.

00:50:51.850 --> 00:50:54.320
So I think school
districts can play

00:50:54.320 --> 00:51:00.090
a role in helping to create
more of these types of schools.

00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:02.410
AUDIENCE: You obviously
want to have it

00:51:02.410 --> 00:51:05.300
on much, much grander
scale than it is now.

00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:07.611
NIKHIL GOYAL: Well, starting
off, I'd love to see--

00:51:07.611 --> 00:51:08.860
AUDIENCE: Who will drive this?

00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:10.620
NIKHIL GOYAL: Well,
I think policymakers

00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:12.902
can do a lot of good in that.

00:51:12.902 --> 00:51:14.610
Like I mentioned, I
think pilot programs.

00:51:14.610 --> 00:51:16.110
I think, why don't
we start a couple

00:51:16.110 --> 00:51:19.330
of these programs in schools and
study them around the country?

00:51:19.330 --> 00:51:22.020
Or at least send a
group of officials

00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:24.352
from the Department of
Education or State Departments

00:51:24.352 --> 00:51:26.810
of Education to the schools
and let's see the effectiveness

00:51:26.810 --> 00:51:29.670
and look at this research
on a larger scale.

00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:32.510
And I think starting
with a school,

00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:35.080
in a school you could have a
group of students trying this

00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:38.190
out and seeing whether it works,
and seeing how it functions.

00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:40.690
I would really encourage
that to happen.

00:51:40.690 --> 00:51:42.210
And schools can do
that themselves.

00:51:42.210 --> 00:51:43.530
Policymakers can do that.

00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:45.250
And then, individual
educators can

00:51:45.250 --> 00:51:48.447
advocate for those changes
in their districts.

00:51:48.447 --> 00:51:50.530
So it comes from different
places, not necessarily

00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:52.000
just one person.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.117
But certainly, if the secretary
of education wants to do this,

00:51:55.117 --> 00:51:56.450
I would love to see that happen.

00:51:56.450 --> 00:51:59.380
But it's very unlikely that
he would want to do that.

00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:08.200
AUDIENCE: So in
your ideal world,

00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:12.900
if your kind of idea of how
education should be K to 12

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:17.020
were to roll out, how would
you see that happening?

00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:20.760
And what would it look like?

00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:24.300
NIKHIL GOYAL: Well, I think
one of my favorite models

00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:26.664
is the School
Without Walls model.

00:52:26.664 --> 00:52:28.830
And I think that would be
a really interesting thing

00:52:28.830 --> 00:52:32.490
to try out in a couple of
cities where you-- I mean,

00:52:32.490 --> 00:52:35.240
there'd be partnerships
between local community

00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:38.517
agencies, the government,
and school districts.

00:52:38.517 --> 00:52:40.600
I think there'd be kind
of like a database system,

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:43.180
where people can
get matched based

00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:46.510
on, like an apprenticeship
or internship they work on,

00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:49.960
and matched with adults
in that community.

00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:52.280
And then, I think
there could be areas

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:56.470
where you can have classes and
activities available for kids.

00:52:56.470 --> 00:53:00.170
One of the examples I talk
about in the book is in Chicago,

00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:02.330
they have the Cities of
Learning Initiative, where

00:53:02.330 --> 00:53:07.470
the kids in a summer program,
they-- because a lot of kids

00:53:07.470 --> 00:53:09.370
who don't have access
to summer camps

00:53:09.370 --> 00:53:11.880
are oftentimes just
playing on the street.

00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:15.070
They don't have any
real opportunities.

00:53:15.070 --> 00:53:17.170
They called it the
Summer of Learning

00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:21.170
where they had a database of
activities where kids could

00:53:21.170 --> 00:53:25.860
earn digital badges based on the
activities that they worked on.

00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:29.320
And that was a really good
way to get kids, poor kids,

00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:34.242
in these activities and learn
skills and gain knowledge.

00:53:34.242 --> 00:53:35.700
And so I'd like to
see that happen.

00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:39.210
It's happening in Los
Angeles, Pittsburgh,

00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:41.089
and a couple of other cities.

00:53:41.089 --> 00:53:42.630
So I'd like to see
a kind of database

00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:45.000
where kids can choose
the activities they're

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.040
most interested in.

00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:47.956
And then you could,
obviously, streamline that

00:53:47.956 --> 00:53:50.830
based on individual
schools and teachers.

00:53:50.830 --> 00:53:55.580
But again, these are obviously
very, sometimes far-fetched

00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:56.080
ideas.

00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:57.620
I would start with
a pilot program

00:53:57.620 --> 00:53:59.080
and see where it
goes from there.

00:54:11.149 --> 00:54:11.690
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:16.210
So you mentioned in passing
AMC, medical schools

00:54:16.210 --> 00:54:19.450
are moving towards a more
whole person-based evaluation

00:54:19.450 --> 00:54:24.760
of students as opposed to
just strictly objective,

00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:27.270
do you pass these requirements?

00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:28.420
That's all well and good.

00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:30.030
The problem is--
well, one concern

00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:33.860
is that raises the cost
of evaluating students.

00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:36.470
And that would be particularly
important from the high school

00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:40.180
to college level and college
to post-secondary level.

00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:44.821
And one of the impacts would
be to potentially reduce

00:54:44.821 --> 00:54:46.820
the number of students
who can access education.

00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:49.440
Because oftentimes,
application fees

00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:52.900
are not refundable
and not really covered

00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:56.670
under any sort of financial aid.

00:54:56.670 --> 00:55:00.129
Do you have any ideas on
how to address that problem?

00:55:00.129 --> 00:55:00.920
NIKHIL GOYAL: Yeah.

00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:02.490
I mean, in terms of the cost.

00:55:02.490 --> 00:55:08.110
I think, obviously, I'm in big
favor of free higher education.

00:55:08.110 --> 00:55:11.190
And I think that would
include applying to college,

00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:14.250
that there should
be at least waivers

00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:20.350
or a place where kids
can-- for application fees.

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:24.900
Because it can be quite
exorbitant after some time.

00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:27.480
Porfolio-based assessment,
at least-- there's

00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:31.630
about 850 colleges in this
country that no longer require

00:55:31.630 --> 00:55:34.170
the SAT or ACT for admissions.

00:55:34.170 --> 00:55:37.850
These are schools
like NYU, Wake Forest,

00:55:37.850 --> 00:55:39.450
a lot of liberal arts colleges.

00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:42.570
Bennington, Hampshire,
and others, they

00:55:42.570 --> 00:55:45.040
don't require the SAT or ACT.

00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:47.190
Some of these, they
ask for students

00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:51.670
to submit a portfolio of a
product they did, or a paper.

00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:54.640
Bard, I think, announced a
couple years ago that students

00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:59.880
could submit four 2,500-word
essays graded by a teacher.

00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:02.570
I think those are kind of
interesting models to look at.

00:56:02.570 --> 00:56:06.830
But yeah, cost is a big,
big factor for how--

00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:11.240
because it will take more time
to evaluate those applications.

00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:13.680
I mean, I was hearing
kind of one proposal

00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:18.300
where a school could kind
of-- say a school doesn't want

00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:19.950
to move towards that system.

00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:25.100
You could have a situation where
a school could say to a kid,

00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:29.940
say you have a lower
than 2,000 SAT score.

00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:34.240
Then you could submit an
extra portfolio or something

00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:37.650
that shows that you're
capable of certain tasks.

00:56:37.650 --> 00:56:40.670
So that could be
a way for students

00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:43.360
to show that they're
able to do things

00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:44.560
beyond a standardized test.

00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:46.559
And it might be a little
bit more cost effective

00:56:46.559 --> 00:56:48.690
than asking every kid
to submit a portfolio.

00:56:48.690 --> 00:56:51.080
So I think there's kind of
innovative approaches to that.

00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:53.190
And I think a lot of
liberal arts colleges

00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:55.050
are moving in that
direction, even if they

00:56:55.050 --> 00:56:57.060
haven't done so already.

00:56:57.060 --> 00:57:00.010
AUDIENCE: Nevertheless, there's
still a lot of back-end costs.

00:57:00.010 --> 00:57:03.190
My last job was actually
admissions processing.

00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:05.350
And it's still archaic.

00:57:05.350 --> 00:57:08.140
Transcripts are
physically mailed around.

00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:11.460
Would you propose any
incentives to perhaps streamline

00:57:11.460 --> 00:57:13.420
or modernize that system?

00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:15.580
NIKHIL GOYAL: Yeah.

00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:17.120
I'm forgetting the
name, but there

00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:19.760
is a consortium of
schools, of colleges,

00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:22.150
that was recently announced
that was talking about this.

00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:26.000
They were trying to create
a much more portfolio-based

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:26.750
approach.

00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:29.790
I think it was a couple Ivy
League schools, Stanford,

00:57:29.790 --> 00:57:32.260
that were saying that we
need to make it easier

00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:33.650
for kids to apply to college.

00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:36.050
And I think it included digital
transcripts, or at least

00:57:36.050 --> 00:57:38.870
making that process streamlined.

00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:41.430
I'm forgetting the name, but
there was something about that

00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:42.722
recently.

00:57:42.722 --> 00:57:46.070
AUDIENCE: I didn't hear anything
about it at my last job.

00:57:46.070 --> 00:57:46.570
All right.

00:57:46.570 --> 00:57:48.323
Yeah, it's just a
concern of mine.

00:57:48.323 --> 00:57:50.906
It's something I've been kicking
around at the back of my head

00:57:50.906 --> 00:57:54.250
because it is a real cost.

00:57:54.250 --> 00:57:58.110
And I've only seen
applications become more

00:57:58.110 --> 00:58:00.969
onerous on students, not less.

00:58:00.969 --> 00:58:03.010
I think that's more of a
comment than a question.

00:58:05.405 --> 00:58:05.946
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:58:05.946 --> 00:58:06.945
Thank you for your talk.

00:58:06.945 --> 00:58:07.930
It was interesting.

00:58:07.930 --> 00:58:11.870
I had a question about as you
move to this system being more

00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:14.382
widespread, if you can get
it past the pilot stage,

00:58:14.382 --> 00:58:16.090
you would probably
have to train teachers

00:58:16.090 --> 00:58:17.750
in how to teach in
this new system.

00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:20.200
How do you propose to do
that on a large scale?

00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:21.790
NIKHIL GOYAL: I
think that's actually

00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:25.350
probably the second biggest
challenge, really transforming

00:58:25.350 --> 00:58:28.170
graduate education schools.

00:58:28.170 --> 00:58:31.180
And I don't think I have an
answer to that because it

00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:33.330
is a monumental task.

00:58:33.330 --> 00:58:35.729
Even if you have the
pilot program in place,

00:58:35.729 --> 00:58:37.270
and you have teachers
who are trained

00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:39.820
in a way that is
very traditional,

00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:41.410
it's going to falter.

00:58:41.410 --> 00:58:43.600
So I mean, I'd like to
see graduate education

00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:47.400
schools change, but I
have not seen any movement

00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:49.685
on that regard in
higher education.

00:58:49.685 --> 00:58:51.060
But yeah, it's a
very good point.

00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:55.750
It's something that I think
we need to talk about more.

00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:56.500
SUNNI YUEN: Great.

00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:57.780
Well, thanks so much, Nikhil.

00:58:57.780 --> 00:59:00.580
Everybody, please check out
his book, "Schools on Trial,"

00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:04.295
with a very catchy byline
on how freedom-- or rather,

00:59:04.295 --> 00:59:06.420
"How Freedom and Creativity
Can Fix Our Educational

00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:06.962
Malpractice."

00:59:06.962 --> 00:59:08.670
NIKHIL GOYAL: Thanks
again for having me.

00:59:08.670 --> 00:59:09.790
SUNNI YUEN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:59:09.790 --> 00:59:11.340
