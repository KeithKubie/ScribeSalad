[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.249 --> 00:00:07.290
SPEAKER 1: We're really,
really happy to have you

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.780
all here today and
really, really excited

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.694
to be presenting--

00:00:11.694 --> 00:00:13.501
whoop-- on screen--

00:00:13.501 --> 00:00:15.000
we'll have to move
that over to make

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.080
sure you're on screen too-- to
presenting Hershey Felder, who

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.930
is currently appearing
at Theater Works

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.370
through July 9 in
his one-man show,

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.130
"Hershey Felder, Beethoven,"
which is yet another

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.710
in a series of the
remarkable sets of shows

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.470
that he's put together over
the past many, many years.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.540
He's done Chopin.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.510
He's done Tchaikovsky.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.800
He's done Irving Berlin.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.520
He's done Leonard
Bernstein, Gershwin.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.770
You name it, it seems
like he's played

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.080
that music and the
composer and the musician.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.184
When the presenters asked if
we could do Beethoven here,

00:00:48.184 --> 00:00:49.350
I said, that would be great.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.900
But we don't have
room with a piano that

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.190
would be appropriate.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.090
And Steinway very graciously
trucked in this Steinway B.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.040
So thanks so much for
Hershey for coming.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.099
And thanks so much to
Steinway for providing

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:07.080
this wonderful, wonderful
piano that I think

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.090
you're all going to enjoy.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.860
So we have some brochures about
the ongoing Theater Works'

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.340
production of this current show,
"Beethoven," which is breaking

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.960
all records at Theater Works.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.760
His previous show
on Irving Berlin

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.370
broke the records the
last time he was here.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.650
And I just found out
that, as of two days ago,

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.700
he just broke his own record.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.880
So this is a fantastic show.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.380
If you're lucky enough to be
able to get tickets between now

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.300
and July 9, please do.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.570
But in the meantime, enjoy
"Hershey Felder, Beethoven"

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.031
right here at Google.

00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:39.114
HERSHEY FELDER: Thank you.

00:01:39.114 --> 00:01:41.026
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:43.894 --> 00:01:47.430
To be more specific [AUDIO OUT]
break my own record.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.040
It's good to know that
Beethoven broke Irving Berlin's

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.010
record actually.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.490
I'm just a vehicle for doing
this stuff and telling stories.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.290
A lot of this is
both talking to you

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.290
in music-- which is what
I do actually in reality.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.220
It's creating character as
well as playing the music

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.890
and looking very
carefully at the music

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.720
as we create the character.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.070
When I started this, probably
25 years ago, people simply

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.770
laughed at me.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:15.960
They said, nobody
is going to come.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.050
Nobody knows who you are.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.580
Nobody cares.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.950
And I wanted to start
with Chopin above all.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.259
So people said, well
"Chop-in"-- who knows "Chop-in?"

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:25.050
And you want to call
it Monsieur "Chop-in."

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.700
So nobody's going
to know anything.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.110
Nobody recognizes your name.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.966
What's a Hershey Felder?

00:02:29.966 --> 00:02:31.590
Why don't you start
with somebody who's

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.240
a little bit more recognizable?

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.801
At this point, I met members
of the Gershwin family.

00:02:35.801 --> 00:02:37.800
And I said, well, I play
"The Rhapsody in Blue."

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.710
Why don't I create the role of
George Gershwin, just as a fun

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.420
thing.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.220
And somebody in Hollywood
said, pull back your hair.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.725
So I did.

00:02:44.725 --> 00:02:45.350
They said, gee.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.470
You've got the same nose.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.630
I said, [AUDIO OUT].

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.420
It travels well.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.560
So I created the character
of George Gershwin.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.930
And all of a sudden,
this whole idea took off.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.670
It's become a bit of
a cottage industry,

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.360
but a little more than that.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.360
So the idea is, really--

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.443
one of the things that's
wonderful about this kind

00:03:01.443 --> 00:03:03.480
of stuff is that I get
to engage audience.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.900
And I've engaged audience
anywhere from 18,000

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.760
at Ravinia in Chicago, where
I talked to them directly

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.220
and they ask questions,
to a small audience,

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.876
like we have today, a nice, very
esoteric, thoughtful audience,

00:03:15.876 --> 00:03:17.750
everybody with their
computers in their laps.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:18.249
It's just--

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:19.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.690
Which brings me to this
gentleman's question.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:22.800
So [AUDIO OUT].

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.480
AUDIENCE: John.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.770
HERSHEY FELDER: John.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.610
And tell me what happened, John,
for the rest of the crowd here.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.565
And I'll repeat for--

00:03:27.565 --> 00:03:29.440
AUDIENCE: I was at your
performance, I think,

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.300
two Thursdays ago.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.746
And we found out later,
a PG&amp;E transformer blew.

00:03:33.746 --> 00:03:35.390
And the whole theater went dark.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.890
And--

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.010
HERSHEY FELDER: It was the most
exciting night in the theater.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.890
So there I am, 20 minutes into
this show-- and this gentleman

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:41.910
says, I was there.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:42.940
Has that ever happened?

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.810
So let me just preface this
by saying, you'd think,

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.540
in Mountain View, the technology
would always be working.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.420
And apparently, not the case.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.580
So there I was on stage.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.270
There were 600
people in the house.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:55.230
John was one of them.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.150
I begin the
"Beethoven" show, which

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.580
begins very derelictly
with Beethoven's very

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.430
first composition.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.260
[MUSIC - BEETHOVEN, "9
VARIATIONS IN C MINOR"]

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.420
Imagine, he was 11-years-old.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.630
And even then, he
had a sense of hope.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.090
And then, I get to
some fancy part.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.250
Blackout!

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.030
And I said, this
is very effective.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.340
But it wasn't just a blackout.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.270
It was a bang.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.140
It was a pop.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.600
All of a sudden, lights went.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.530
Sound went.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.830
And black.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.270
And 600 people sat there.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.670
And I said, OK, now what?

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.200
And so, clearly,
the mics were off.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.060
The electricity was gone.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.190
And I said, ladies
and gentlemen, this

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.584
is not part of the show.

00:04:47.584 --> 00:04:49.250
Because I think people
thought, oh, this

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.770
is one of those exciting
moments where we've

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.645
gone into Beethoven's darkness.

00:04:53.645 --> 00:04:56.270
I've already explained that his
father beat the hell out of him

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.540
as a kid and that it's
possibly that's why

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.610
he went deaf later in life,
because his father beat him.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.320
We have clear evidence that his
father beat him as a child--

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.290
and his head.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:08.995
And so, I explain
to the audience,

00:05:08.995 --> 00:05:10.370
this has nothing
to do with that.

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.020
Please, stay in your places.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.490
Now, you don't
know you're dealing

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.031
with a lot of different ages,
especially in a show like that.

00:05:16.031 --> 00:05:16.950
People begin to panic.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:17.616
They got scared.

00:05:17.616 --> 00:05:19.370
I thought we did
OK, don't you think?

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.190
But 600 people-- and I
thought, this is terrifying.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.370
It's black in this room.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.272
There's no way out.

00:05:24.272 --> 00:05:26.730
I said, ladies and gentlemen,
this is not part of the show.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:27.564
And it's not a joke.

00:05:27.564 --> 00:05:29.063
Something's happened
with the power.

00:05:29.063 --> 00:05:29.810
Just sit there.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.670
OK, so they sit.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:35.557
And then we wait for staff
to tell us what's going on,

00:05:35.557 --> 00:05:36.140
what happened.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.870
What we find out later
is that some doofus

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.540
was playing with his
drone in the park

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.410
and flew the drone into a
transformer and blew it up.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.100
So the entire of 1,600
people in Mountain View

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.140
didn't have electricity
for god-knows-what,

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.680
including our theater.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.250
Now, the lights only
come on for 20 minutes--

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.470
the emergency lights.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.120
And so, I take off.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.222
And I say, well,
figure it this way.

00:06:01.222 --> 00:06:02.930
Why don't I ask the
audience questions?--

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.490
like I will with you today.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.000
And audience ask questions.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.540
So one lady says, I
saw all your shows.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.490
And I didn't see
the Gershwin show.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.860
So can you do me a
favor and tell us

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.030
about the Gershwin show?

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.720
And I said, why not?

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.930
And so, I played a little
bit of the Gershwin show--

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.760
[MUSIC - GEORGE GERSHWIN,
 "RHAPSODY IN BLUE"]

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:27.770
--and explained that that theme
was sold to United Airlines

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.970
for $3 million in
1980-- four bars--

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.240
in 1985 or something like that.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.290
So you can think of
George Gershwin, who

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.110
died at the age
of 38, not knowing

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.700
how successful he would become.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.860
His brother, Ira--
and he died suddenly

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.020
from fulminating
brain tumor that he'd

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.190
had since he was a child.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:47.390
And it just fulminated.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.120
Imagine all that
music that we know.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.320
Suddenly, at 38, [SNAPS]
just like that, America

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.670
lost such a voice.

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.910
And there, all of a sudden, we
have, all these years later,

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.330
United Airlines buying
it for $3 million.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:00.830
I could suggest
that United Airlines

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.440
would have spent better money
doing other things lately.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.420
But you know, that's
a whole other story.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:06.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.850
Maybe personal relations--
the kind of thing

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:10.970
would probably be
better, ultimately,

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:14.210
to understand the value
of music and composing.

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:18.820
And if we can only begin to
understand what Beethoven did--

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.860
the technology that is being
created here on these premises,

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.800
things that are happening, is
essentially what Beethoven did,

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.200
a man who was completely
deaf, who changed

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.420
the entire world of music.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.700
Up until Beethoven's
time, certainly,

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.950
when he started
to go deaf, music

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:36.570
was essentially a
descriptive form.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:37.490
There were rules.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.300
What you never did was
fifths in parallels.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.572
[PIANO CHORDS]

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.330
You did a little bit
IN old church singing,

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:48.080
but generally not.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.390
Certainly, fourths never went.

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:50.234
[PIANO CHORDS]

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.800
Because that's kind of ugly.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.960
There's something
wonderfully ugly about it.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.270
And Beethoven started
breaking those rules.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.490
And of course, his
teacher, Haydn,

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:02.130
couldn't stand the fact
that Beethoven was actually

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:03.630
making ugly music.

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:06.450
But while Beethoven was
busy making ugly music,

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:10.640
taking the first chord of the
"C Minor Pathetique Sonata"--

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.510
[PIANO CHORD]

00:08:12.355 --> 00:08:12.980
Listen to that.

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.410
It doesn't sound like anything
except ugly, doesn't it?

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:16.430
It's just thick.

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:16.970
It's ugly.

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:17.470
It's rich.

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:18.734
[PIANO CHORDS]

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:21.310
What does that mean?

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:25.050
Essentially, Beethoven broke
all the fine elegant rules

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:26.120
of music-making.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.870
Whereas, Mozart would
have structured it--

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:28.920
[PIANO CHORDS]

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.159
--and somebody else-- Haydn
would have structured it,

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:35.549
Beethoven, he takes all the
emotion, all the energy,

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:37.710
and he packs it
into a solid chord

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:40.799
right at the very
beginning of a sonata,

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:43.500
right at the point where
he starts to go deaf.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.790
Now, what does this do?

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.200
This changes the world of music.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.710
Because up until that
point, music was elegant.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:51.900
Suddenly, music became personal.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.520
It became emotional.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:57.540
It became an expression of a
man basically screaming inside,

00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:59.640
what is happening to me?

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.530
Now, you have to think--

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:02.520
look, I'm a musician--

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.230
God forbid it shouldn't happen--

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:05.970
I go deaf.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:08.324
It'll be painful for me
and a few of my friends

00:09:08.324 --> 00:09:09.240
that I will scream at.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.820
But quite, frankly
nobody will really care.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.820
But Beethoven--
think of the person

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.010
who has changed
technology today,

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:19.800
whoever that one
person is, suddenly

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.250
being impeded from being able
to do that, whatever it is.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.650
The brain stops
functioning, whatever it is.

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:27.420
Or any one of you
who are developing

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.340
these incredible things today--

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.550
that suddenly, the one
gift that you have,

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:34.770
the one thing that you
have above everybody

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.380
else-- in Beethoven's
case, perfect hearing

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.730
and perfect sense of invention--
suddenly disappears on you.

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:44.940
And you have enough
faculty left to understand

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.440
that that has disappeared.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.580
What do you do?

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.760
So here was a man
who was able to take

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.540
everything going against him and
still create beautiful music.

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.210
My theory has always been,
in the case of Beethoven,

00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:00.120
that music changed because
he couldn't self-edit.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.380
Most of us, as we go through
life, we write things.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.880
And then we say, ah, tomorrow,
I have to give a Google talk.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.027
I'm going to write it down.

00:10:07.027 --> 00:10:08.610
And boy, I'm going
to sound brilliant.

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:10.590
Because, look, it's
just genius on paper.

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:13.089
And then I stand up in front
of people, and I start talking.

00:10:13.089 --> 00:10:14.381
I sound like a total nitwit.

00:10:14.381 --> 00:10:14.880
Why?

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.240
Because what lives and
breathes in air and space

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.690
is very different than what
exists in your head on paper.

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:24.350
In this kind of communication,
that has to work.

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:26.400
So it takes a lifetime
to understand that.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.830
Beethoven no longer
had the ability

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:30.690
to go into a theater
in a concert hall,

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:32.506
sit and listen,
and go, you know,

00:10:32.506 --> 00:10:33.630
that doesn't sound so good.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.040
I think I meant that on paper.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.390
But now, when I hear it
with the whole orchestra,

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:38.820
it doesn't quite
work out for me.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.160
I think I should shift this
note here and this note there.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.451
That'll give a different color.

00:10:42.451 --> 00:10:43.890
It will tell a different story.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:45.120
He didn't do that.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.550
What he did was,
essentially, put on paper

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:51.720
what he imagined in the sonic
world that remained in his head

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.940
and left that for
us to interpret.

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.470
And because of
that, we were forced

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:59.580
to go to his sonic world in his
imagination, not a sonic world

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:05.310
that he fixed to make it correct
for us to hear and understand.

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:06.960
Of course, when it
comes to Beethoven,

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.630
he still had a sense of
melody, a sense of harmony,

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:11.090
that was absolutely beautiful.

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:13.340
One of the pieces that I'll
just play for you simply--

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:16.140
and then we can begin our
interactive discussion--

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.930
is the piece that, essentially,
was last published,

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:20.890
40 years after he died.

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:23.670
It was discovered-- and there
are several versions to it.

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:25.650
Nobody knows where
it really originated,

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:29.760
if the original notes that we
now play are his actual notes.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.000
But it's interesting that,
whatever it is, the story

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.680
that is behind all of it--

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.350
discovering this
piece so much after he

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:40.560
died, not knowing to
who it was written,

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.250
because apparently--
several things.

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:44.940
One, the inscription could
have been copied down wrong.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.420
Or Beethoven's hand was so messy
that the guy who copied it down

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:49.590
got the name wrong.

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:50.680
Nobody knows.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.910
But this piece, "Fur Elise,"
that every student plays,

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:55.860
that every young person
plays when you get

00:11:55.860 --> 00:12:00.900
introduced to the piano, that
very piece is Beethoven Lore.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:04.440
And yet, it's the lore that
we have put upon the piece.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.200
And what is really interesting
about it is that it does

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.930
somehow reveal, in
its most basic form--

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.230
probably composed in 1810--

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:17.328
a very sensitive, very elegant,
and very heartfelt Beethoven.

00:12:17.328 --> 00:12:20.316
[MUSIC - BEETHOVEN, "FUR ELISE"]

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.134
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:10.134 --> 00:15:14.475
Simple and elegant
and beautiful-- so now

00:15:14.475 --> 00:15:16.100
the floor gets to be
open to questions.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.170
And you get to ask
anything about Beethoven,

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:20.540
about what it is I do,
anything you want to know.

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.880
But you must ask, in order
to make this fun and work.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.450
So go ahead.

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:25.100
Don't be shy.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.240

you have a question.

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:29.630
Yes, over there.

at the-- no, not you.

program notes, where

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:55.820
it says, more biographical
information about some

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:58.370
of the other people who were
involved in the production,

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:00.870
it doesn't say, for instance,
where you were born,

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:02.519
where you were educated--

00:16:02.519 --> 00:16:03.310
HERSHEY FELDER: OK.

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:04.130

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:05.420
HERSHEY FELDER: Things
like that-- so basic things

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.310
about me, where I was
born, I was educated.

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:11.660
I was born in a land far
off, very much so north.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:13.710
I am an immigrant
to this country.

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:16.580
I was born, essentially,
where we all live in igloos

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:19.880
and cook outside and
hunt fish and whatever.

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:25.120
I was born in Montreal, Canada
and came to this country

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.290
30 years ago to study.

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:29.360
And I went to study
with Jerry Lowenthal,

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.690
a great pianist at Juilliard.

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:32.690
And he was the director.

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:34.065
I was not a student
at Juilliard.

00:16:34.065 --> 00:16:36.080
But I was one of his
private students.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.530
I was an apprentice,
I would say.

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:39.170
And I was beginning
to develop my life

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:40.700
in New York and
this understanding

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.830
that I wanted to do
both theater and music.

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:47.060
I had a proper training,
as a kid in Montreal--

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:49.280
great musicians there, fabulous.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.050
And then I went,
as a young person,

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:52.760
to McGill, when I was 13.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.120
And I studied piano
there with Dorothy Morton

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.090
and Eugene Plawutsky.

00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:57.260
And I studied composition.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.410
And I studied
conducting and really

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:03.140
set on a path of wanting to
do something that nobody did,

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.810
which was combining theater
and music all into one.

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:07.940
And as I said earlier,
everybody laughed at that,

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:10.099
because it's not something
that goes together.

00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:11.520
It doesn't make sense.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.444
First of all, acting
is very extroverted.

00:17:13.444 --> 00:17:15.319
And I was an actor as
a young person as well.

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:18.380
I studied traditional acting
in proper theater school.

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:19.700
And I grew up as an actor.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.160
But I also grew up as a
pianist and a musician.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.530
And I was told very
often-- in fact,

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:26.839
when I auditioned for Yale
as a kid, as a 15-year-old--

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:28.790
which was a nutso thing to do--

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.680
for the acting
program, they were

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.990
talking about my
accomplishments as a pianist.

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:35.360
And they said, well, you
need to pay attention

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.840
to one or the other.

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.170
And it became very clear to
me, for the next 10 years,

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:41.150
I needed to spend
time with music.

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:44.300
Because one can always learn
to become a better actor as one

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:45.080
grows.

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.580
But if you don't pay attention
to your music as you grow up,

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:48.480
you're finished.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.840
So for the next 10 years,
although I acted a little bit,

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:53.930
I paid very close attention
to both musicianship

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:56.540
and studying the
real craft of music.

00:17:56.540 --> 00:18:00.590
Then, when I was
26, 27-years-old,

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:03.650
this whole notion of creating
"Gershwin" came together.

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:05.210
I opened it in Los Angeles.

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:06.651
And stars started showing up.

00:18:06.651 --> 00:18:08.150
And I thought,
what's going on here?

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:09.470
Something's very wrong.

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:11.870
The kinds of characters
that showed up to see me--

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:14.120
popular stars, Warren
Beatty and Annette Bening

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.280
and Neil Simon and
Paul Thomas Anderson,

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.440
movie-makers and so on.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.490
I said, I may be
on to something.

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:22.370
And it took off and,
within a few years,

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:25.745
became the Gershwins' highest
growing entity for the estate.

00:18:25.745 --> 00:18:27.620
And I thought, maybe
there's a story to this.

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:28.850
Why don't I do Chopin?

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:30.020
Everybody laughed.

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:30.980
Nobody's going to come.

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:31.850
I did that.

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:33.470
And it worked.

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:38.840
And I took us into Poland and
Paris in the 1830s and 1840s.

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.310
And everybody laughed at me.

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.820
Fine.

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:42.000
Then, that worked.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.310
And then, I said, I'm
going to do Beethoven.

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:44.610
And everybody laughed at that.

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:46.190
They said, nobody will come.

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:47.270
Nobody cares.

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:48.650
Nobody's interested.

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:52.280
Yesterday, it was announced
that it broke the record here

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.770
by, I think, 300% or 400%.

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:56.970
So it's not about
me or what I do.

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:58.980
I'm just a vehicle to
tell these stories.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.850
It's about these characters
and how much they mean.

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:04.660
And as technology advances,
as we learn new things,

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.410
one of the interesting
things is to always

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:09.560
look at people who came
before us who changed whatever

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:12.650
technical means and
whatever things that changed

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:16.117

up, as they grew up,

and to understand what they did.

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:20.090
And for me, the most interesting
thing about Beethoven

or Gershwin or anyone--

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:23.060
you think about Gershwin.

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.110
And we now know jazz.

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:26.510
But you think about
that clarinet solo

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:28.100
at the beginning
of "The Rhapsody."

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.525
It starts with a
trill like this.

[PIANO CHORDS]

00:19:31.475 --> 00:19:35.385
And then, the clarinet is placed
half way, up till about there.

00:19:35.385 --> 00:19:36.510
And then he bends the note.

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:39.417
"Oo-wya-a da-da-da-da."

00:19:39.417 --> 00:19:40.750
On the piano, you can't do that.

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:42.208
Because a piano
doesn't bend notes.

00:19:42.208 --> 00:19:43.330
They're specific, right?

The point is to be
ridiculous and funny as well.

But when something
like that happens,

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:11.970
the interesting
thing for all of us,

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:16.190
whatever it is we do invent,
is to think back before that.

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:20.240
Think back to something that
seems evident and obvious

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:25.160
to us today and a given and what
must have been like to invent

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.410
something like that.

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:31.460
Interestingly enough, Gershwin
did write a glissando.

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:34.250
Now, a glissando, essentially,
if you're on the piano,

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:34.790
means this.

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:36.420
[PIANO SCALE]

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:39.206
You take the back of your
finger and you roll up the keys.

00:20:39.206 --> 00:20:41.080
And it sort of connects
the keys in that way.

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.140
It's not an even scale.

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.120
It just "schwoo"-- like that.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.970
But if you write a
glissando in a clarinet,

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:48.530
it's a different kind of thing.

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:49.880
He did write that.

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:51.560
But the story goes
that they were

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.600
busy rehearsing "The
Rhapsody in Blue"

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:59.750
in 1924 for the first appearance
in 43rd Street at Aeolian Hall.

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:02.150
And apparently, the
clarinetist was bored.

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:03.080
He was bored to tears.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.430
The rehearsal was boring.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:05.840

fidgeting around.

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:11.700
And he went la-da-da-da-da

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.190
And then suddenly, you
heard this screaming siren.

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:15.750
And everybody thought
George Gershwin

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:17.940
was going to fly off the
handle and get really mad.

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:19.410
But George Gershwin,
the inventor,

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:22.120
realized, this is
going to change music.

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.740
And he kept that crazy
clarinet glissando in,

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:28.280

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.640
A modern art exhibition
that happens in LA.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:47.510
And people go.

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:48.860
And there's this white canvas.

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:49.760
It's huge.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.140
It's 5' by 3'.

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:52.806
It's sitting there
in the museum.

00:24:52.806 --> 00:24:53.930
And the critics are coming.

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:54.817
Ooh!

00:24:54.817 --> 00:24:55.316
Ah!

00:24:55.316 --> 00:24:57.070
[GASP] Look what's inside!

00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:57.740
Ooh!

00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:58.250
It's white.

00:24:58.250 --> 00:24:58.749
It's blank.

00:24:58.749 --> 00:24:59.500
Ooh!

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:00.290
Ahh!

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:02.930
Don't you see what that is?

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:04.670
Three weeks later,
the same artist

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:07.730
comes back with a development
on the first thing.

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:09.860
He comes with the
same white painting

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:14.810
except, in the lower right hand
corner, are two small dots.

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:16.670
The critics come and they look.

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:17.780
And they analyze.

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:19.850
And they look at the two
small dots and go, egh!

00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:23.840
[YIDDISH]

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:27.530
So [YIDDISH] means, eh,
overstuffed, too much, too--

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:28.610
that's the whole thing.

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:29.210
What is art?

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:32.660
Art is in the perception of the
person who is looking at it.

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:36.380
But for me, Chopin
really got it right.

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:39.440
Art really is created
by the artist.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:42.470
But time is the deciding factor.

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:43.550
He said this.

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:45.840
He said, I have no idea
if this piece is good.

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.460
In 100 years, ask me.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:48.960
And I will tell you.

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.930
And that's really the idea.

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:52.310
An artist can have an idea.

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:54.410
But what we think
today is great art--

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:55.850
and this is what's interesting.

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:58.430
What is purported as
being by the critics,

00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:00.530
be it a play or this or that--

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:03.020
people are talking about the
new play "Hamilton" and so on.

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:04.186
It's a very effective piece.

00:26:04.186 --> 00:26:06.380
I've seen it on Broadway twice.

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:07.880
Will it be around in 100 years?

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:10.460
And will it mean the
same thing in 100 years

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:13.280
that even "Fiddler on the
Roof" now means to us,

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:16.489
even though it was created
those 60 years ago?

00:26:16.489 --> 00:26:17.030
50 years ago?

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:17.890
Or whatever it is?

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:19.880
--a little bit more than that.

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:20.660
We don't know.

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:23.070
We can only know then.

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:25.310
And time is the great
decider for that.

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:27.110
So when does art become art?

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:28.670
When does noise become art?

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:31.310
George Gershwin said
that he would go down

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:34.370
the streets of Manhattan
and the noise of the city

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:36.140
is what created his music.

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:38.210
Beethoven-- it was
obviously the noise

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:43.130
that was in his spirit that
had to come out in that way.

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:46.400
What I think art becomes is
when it touches enough people

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.660
to mean something.

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:50.600
That's when noise becomes music.

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:54.110
It's not defined by
the artist as a rule.

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:56.510
And it's not defined by
an audience as a rule.

00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:59.870
It's defined as how
long it takes for art

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:03.590
to become something that goes
into the spirit and moves

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:04.190
people.

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:05.780
And if it moves people,
it will stick around.

00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:07.690
That's why Shakespeare
is still around.

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:10.040
This stuff is still
around because it's human.

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:11.510
And I think the
artists who stick

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:14.900
to being human and not
pretentious or cleverer

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:18.470
than are the artists who tend
to stick around the longest.

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:21.890
And the struggle is to find
the honesty in the work,

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:23.770
to make sure that that happens.

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:26.390
And in far as my own work,
that's a struggle every day,

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:28.430
is not to be pretentious
about what it is,

00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:31.850
to just be simple and
straightforward and human.

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:34.130
And I think the danger
now is, because there

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:36.630
is so much pretense
on the internet

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:40.010
and so everybody has an opinion,
is that people try to please

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:41.954
too many people too often.

00:27:41.954 --> 00:27:44.120
And so what lands up happening
is a lot of pretense,

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.610
as opposed to just a
simple honest expression,

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:48.859
and let it out there
to see what happens.

00:27:48.859 --> 00:27:49.900
Another question, please.

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:53.439
Yes, over there-- gentleman

00:27:53.439 --> 00:27:55.480
AUDIENCE: I have a related
question to that also.

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:55.840
HERSHEY FELDER: Sure.

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.890
AUDIENCE: So, in tech, it's
actually quite easy for us

00:27:57.890 --> 00:27:58.390
to invent.

00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:00.731
Because we just look for
challenges people have.

00:28:00.731 --> 00:28:02.230
And then we just
find the challenge,

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:04.810
and the invention kind
of happens naturally.

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:08.170
And I've heard from some people
that these great artists often

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:09.820
used the world as a mirror.

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:11.590
And they're making
music that mirrors,

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:15.610
like, a social movement, some
outlet for people to have

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:17.360
an outlet for their emotions.

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.676
And I wanted to see if
there's truth to that

00:28:19.676 --> 00:28:20.800
and what your thoughts are.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:21.605
Maybe there are other ways.

00:28:21.605 --> 00:28:21.870
HERSHEY FELDER: Sure.

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:22.930
AUDIENCE: How do
people get [INAUDIBLE]..

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:25.471
HERSHEY FELDER: Well, what you
are saying, in terms of people

00:28:25.471 --> 00:28:28.690
are looking, in your business,
for a need for something

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:29.350
specific.

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:31.690
And then the inventor
goes and follows the need.

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:33.800
I think, similarly
to the artist,

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.830
people are looking
for human connection.

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:38.890
They're looking for anything
that will be, like you say,

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:41.110
the mirror, or will
relate to their own lives,

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:43.900
or will be able to be
a form of expression.

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:47.200
And I think the artist
is intending very much

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.940
to say that.

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:51.310
And I've always said about
the performance art, when

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:55.510
it comes to performance
art, if someone is just

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:57.310
wanting to perform
for themselves

00:28:57.310 --> 00:29:00.630
and not taking the audience into
any kind of consideration, what

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:04.210
lands up happening is perform in
your basement for your mirror.

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:05.830
You perform for yourself.

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:08.530
But the whole thing is
interrelated and very much so

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:10.210
exactly what you say.

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:11.550
You find the need.

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:12.440
You find the niche.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.470
And you go in there,
and you tell the story

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:16.090
or create the invention.

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:19.810
Similarly, for artists,
I think artists find

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:21.610
a story that needs to be told.

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:22.660
They tell it.

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:24.820
And somehow, there is
an audience for it.

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:25.829
There's two types.

00:29:25.829 --> 00:29:27.370
There's a lot of
fashion in Hollywood

00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:31.480
today to create art
for the audience that's

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:33.610
going to buy, for the
tweeners or whatever,

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:35.390
so on and so forth.

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:38.030
And the idea of the artist
is to take that need

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:39.419
and to push even beyond.

00:29:39.419 --> 00:29:41.710
Then, there are artists who
don't care what anybody has

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:43.162
to say about anything they do.

00:29:43.162 --> 00:29:44.120
And they just go ahead.

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:47.560
So art-- it can be
very many things.

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:50.320
But one thing that's very
important is commercial art

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:52.810
or art that is
being sold, art that

00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:57.340
actually is valuable
dollar-wise, is not dirty.

00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:00.130
And that has been a very
big mistake over the years.

00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:01.560
Some of the greatest art--

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:04.300
the Beethovens, the
Chopins, the Gershwins--

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:07.150
they were all highly
conscious that their art had

00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:09.430
to be sold, that they
need to make a living.

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:12.400
And there is monetary
value to their art.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.400
And this notion of
living like a poor artist

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:18.610
in some dreg in some basement
in Manhattan with roaches--

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:20.440
that's absolute nonsense.

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:24.100
An artist is a person who sees
the world in a certain way

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:26.020
and then reflects it
through their medium,

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:30.170
through their prism, to
other people to share.

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:32.180
So it's exactly what
you're saying it is.

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:34.420
It is that mirror,
that reflection.

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:35.566
Someone else.

00:30:35.566 --> 00:30:36.940
We'll go back over
there perhaps.

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:38.128
SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:42.720
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:46.290
I'm curious about the design
elements of your performances.

00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:48.300
Because, for example,
the Beethoven show

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:50.490
is set in a cemetery--

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:51.522
kind of dark.

00:30:51.522 --> 00:30:52.230
Whereas, Chopin--

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:52.800
HERSHEY FELDER: Fun!

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:53.940
Its fun in a cemetery.

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:54.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:55.861
No, I'm kidding.

00:30:55.861 --> 00:30:57.360
AUDIENCE: It was
interesting though.

00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.850
When you're portraying
Beethoven as--

00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:02.070
well, reflecting
back in his youth,

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:04.277
it's kind of an
odd juxtaposition.

00:31:04.277 --> 00:31:06.360
Because it's looking forward
to his ultimate death

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.010
and the final scene and so on.

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:10.320
But then, "Chopin"-- you
had it set in a salon.

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.641
And there's the whole framing
of the lesson and so on.

00:31:12.641 --> 00:31:15.015
So I'm curious about how you
make those design decisions.

00:31:15.015 --> 00:31:16.010
HERSHEY FELDER: Mm-hm, sure.

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:18.290
AUDIENCE: To trade off the
art versus the performance

00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:18.915
versus the set.

00:31:18.915 --> 00:31:19.789
HERSHEY FELDER: Sure.

00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:22.080
Well, one of the things
that has been very integral

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:26.130
in the creation of these pieces
is to set them in a location

00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:28.020
whereby the audience
makes sense.

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:32.280
For instance, today we're
having a discussion in a set up

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:37.290
whereby I'm a talker-speaker
and you are visitors,

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:38.070
hearing me speak.

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:40.239
Similarly, you're
here for a reason.

00:31:40.239 --> 00:31:41.280
You're here to hear this.

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:42.810
People come to the theater.

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:44.292
They have to be
there for a reason.

00:31:44.292 --> 00:31:46.500
If you're going to give a
conceit to a one-man piece,

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.420
where I'm going to
talk to you directly,

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:50.430
there has to be a reason
for you to be there.

00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:53.040
There has to be a reason
for me to do the talking.

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:56.130
Otherwise, we are struggling
for the hour and a half

00:31:56.130 --> 00:31:58.500
to figure out why
any of us are there.

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.180
So I begin with a concept.

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:01.540
You talk about "Chopin."

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.540
"Chopin"-- it wasn't
that it was a salon

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:05.970
and that it was
just there because.

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:07.560
The interesting
thing about Chopin

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:12.150
was that he had seen this
woman that he was ostensibly

00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:17.410
in love with after a year of
her having thrown him out.

00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:19.530
And they ran into
each other by accident

00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:22.110
on a staircase in Paris.

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:24.775
As she was leaving a
friend, he was going up

00:32:24.775 --> 00:32:26.400
to the friend, or
the other way around.

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:27.839
He was leaving the
friend for tea.

00:32:27.839 --> 00:32:29.130
And she was going into the tea.

00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:32.040
And they had broken up in a
terrible breakup a year before.

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:32.890
They see each other.

00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:35.490
They barely have what
to say to one another.

00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:39.330
And he then is heading
to teach a piano class.

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:44.220
So I wondered, what would
happen if I, as Chopin, had

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:47.190
run into this woman who'd
caused me such great pain a year

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:50.190
before and then had to
go teach those students?

00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:52.950
I can assume that the students
would pay dearly for what

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:54.930
just happened just before.

00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:56.340
And so, that's the setup.

00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:58.170
So all the setups
for all these plays

00:32:58.170 --> 00:33:03.600
come from a very conscious
conceit of where we are,

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:06.154
why I'm talking, and
why you are listening.

00:33:06.154 --> 00:33:08.070
In the case of "Beethoven,"
the reason it's in

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:10.486
a cemetery is because the story
actually took place there.

00:33:10.486 --> 00:33:11.220
It's true.

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:12.930
It's not a false conceit.

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:17.280
They actually disinterred
Beethoven's bones in 1863,

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:20.820
because someone on the Music
Society Committee in Vienna

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:24.420
had this idea that they needed
to put his remains in a metal

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:27.480
coffin and to spare
them from further decay.

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:30.720
It was everybody's fascination
in the 1860s with bones

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:33.420
and phrenology and
trying to understand

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:35.010
where people come from.

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:36.930
And they would feel
the scalps of people

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:38.049
and so on and so forth.

00:33:38.049 --> 00:33:39.590
So this was a very
interesting thing.

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:40.950
I found that fascinating.

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:42.240
That's where it takes place.

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.781
And the people who
are gathered there

00:33:43.781 --> 00:33:47.190
are the people who actually
gathered at this disinterment.

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:48.720
All of a sudden,
the bones come out.

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.660
And the person who was
presiding over the disinterment

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:54.852
is saying, we need to keep
these bones up above the earth,

00:33:54.852 --> 00:33:56.310
because the future
of medicine will

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:58.590
be able to determine
what exactly happened

00:33:58.590 --> 00:34:00.850
to Beethoven, why he went deaf.

00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:03.930
And he wanted to know this.

00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:05.400
Let's keep the bones above.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.590
And the committee
makes the argument, no.

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:10.320
We need to keep
them in the earth.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:13.790
We need to put them back,
according to tradition.

00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:16.800
And of course, the doctor,
this Gerhard Von Breuning,

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:19.679
the narrator in this story,
steals two of the bones

00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:22.080
before anybody
knows and can tell.

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:24.150
And those bones,
interestingly enough,

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:26.940
seem to have been at
the Beethoven Center

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:33.040
here at SJSU for many years,
until DNA testing demonstrated

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.449
for us they were a fraud.

00:34:34.449 --> 00:34:36.120
Now, the interesting
thing about that--

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:38.520
when I was asked to do the
show, I said, this is perfect!

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.370
The bones are just
down the street.

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:41.250
Booked the show.

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:42.360
Signed the contract.

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:44.280
Discovered the
bones were a fraud.

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:47.190
So this made for
interesting progress

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:48.630
into telling the story.

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:50.639
But that's the reason
it's set in a cemetery.

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:52.530
The other thing is,
if you'll notice,

00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:55.650
using light and the
cemetery stones,

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:58.650
the cemetery often disappears
to go into other worlds.

00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:00.270
And that we do with light.

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:04.920
So my whole concept has been
go into the imagination when

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:07.540
you're going into these pieces.

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:09.630

As opposed to,
let's be in a room.

00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:14.040
And that's where we are.

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:17.430
It's the ability to go to
as many places as possible

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:20.040
with magic at the same time.

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.640

00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:25.290
And then, maybe we'll have
a little music that relates

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:28.410
to the question perhaps.

00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:30.920
AUDIENCE: So a little
bit different, I think.

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:35.970
But you mentioned that
combining music and theater

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:37.977
has been a difficult craft.

00:35:37.977 --> 00:35:39.810
And a lot of people
dissuaded you from that.

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:41.435
So I was wondering
if you could tell us

00:35:41.435 --> 00:35:42.855
about any of your failures.

Any of my failures?

Well, last night, I missed two
bars in "The Fifth Symphony."

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:48.770
It was horrific.

00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:51.370
And I'm banging away
and bashing away.

sudden, I said, why?

What was going on was I was
thinking of the next line.

Now, most of the audience,
if they didn't really

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:06.106
know the piece
intimately, they wouldn't

00:36:06.106 --> 00:36:08.730
know that two bars a
little bit went sideways.

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:10.650
But I was thinking
of the next line

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:12.690
that was going to come
after I finished playing.

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:14.010
And I put it in my head.

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:15.390
And I'm doing this big passage.

00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:18.060
And I thought, oh my god,
where am I, all of a sudden.

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:22.560
The concentration is so
specific and so razor sharp

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:24.570
that even one move
in a wrong way,

one physical move, one
wrong word, one anything,

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.060

ever in the fridge.

many better things.

Countess Guilietta
Guicciardi, when

00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:18.840
she was asked about the
depth of her relationship,

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:21.800
due to the dedication,
all she said was,

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:24.710
(WHINING TRILLING ACCENT) what?

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:30.290
That penniless bedraggled fellow
who once gave me piano lessons?

00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:33.500
Why should I even care?

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:37.110
(ACCENTED) That was the
thing about Beethoven.

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:41.680
His heart was so full of
love that, sometimes, he

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:44.380
created love where it
simply did not exist.

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:53.980
And so on and so forth.

00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:55.620
Now, I am doing that.

00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:56.779
So the voices are there.

00:40:56.779 --> 00:40:58.320
And I can tell you,
already in this--

00:41:00.278 --> 00:41:02.730

00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:04.020
Because I'm talking.

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:06.450
And I'm trying to talk
to you and impress you

00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:08.380
at the same time.

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:11.370
So the amount that's going on
in there-- the voices going,

00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:13.560
three different
characters are going,

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:18.805
words are going, and playing the
Beethoven is quite complicated.

00:41:18.805 --> 00:41:19.430
It's not just--

00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:20.879

then the voices.

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:34.110
So all that is going on,
while I'm busy yacking at you.

00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:36.398
And worse, I'm looking at you.

00:41:36.398 --> 00:41:37.772
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:42.250
Well, this is good
story, perfect for here.

00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:44.940
So there I am at
the Geffen Theater.

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:45.440
Let me see.

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.180
What show what this was?

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:50.567
I think this was
"Gershwin," all right?

00:41:50.567 --> 00:41:52.400
So at some point, I
sing with the audience--

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.275
[MUSIC - GEORGE GERSHWIN,

00:41:54.275 --> 00:42:02.467
[SINGING]

00:42:02.467 --> 00:42:04.550
And then there's a question
period after the show,

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:06.258
because people are
interested, like this.

00:42:06.258 --> 00:42:07.790
You know, that famous talk-back.

00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:10.580
So one guy is sitting
about halfway back.

00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:17.700
And he says, I just have to tell
you, I work at Skywalker Ranch.

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:20.030
He says, I work for Lucasfilm.

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:22.910
And he says, I've been
watching your shows.

00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:24.830
And I want to know
how you do it.

00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:27.240
I said, well, I practice a lot.

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:27.810
He says, no.

00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:29.990
I want to know
what the trick is.

00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:32.037
And I said, practice, really.

00:42:32.037 --> 00:42:32.870
And he says, no, no.

00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:33.980
I want to know the trick.

00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:37.160
Because you have
completely fooled me.

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:39.080
And he says, I do
this for a living.

00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:40.430
CGI is my thing.

00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:42.350
I have worked on
the biggest films.

00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:44.570
I have directed--
how do you do it?

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:48.080
And I said, how do
I do what exactly?

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:51.200
He says, how do you match
your fingers exactly

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:51.920

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:54.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:56.270
And I looked at him.

00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:57.900
And I said, no, really.

00:42:57.900 --> 00:42:59.630
Ask that a-- he
says, how are you--

00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:03.320
he says, your fingers look-- we
have tried to do this in film

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:04.170
with getting this.

00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:06.140
And we can't seem
to accomplish it.

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:08.240
How do-- I said,
maybe hire a pianist.

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.050
It will work.

00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:10.550
He says, no.

00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:11.630
But how do you do it?

00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:14.090
I said, you've got
to be kidding, right?

00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:16.430
And he somehow couldn't
assess that the person who

00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:19.550
was talking to him and
singing to him, while playing

00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:22.220
in character, somehow
was that same person.

00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:24.369
So people have
asked how you do it.

00:43:24.369 --> 00:43:25.410
This is very interesting.

00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:26.705
Many of you know of Bach--

00:43:26.705 --> 00:43:29.180
[MUSIC - J.S. BACH]

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:37.050
Next voice and so
on and so forth.

00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:39.760
So you have voices going
on in there, right?

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:43.060
The way I've structured
how to do this is this.

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:44.650
First, you must
learn the piano part.

00:43:44.650 --> 00:43:45.520
You must know the treble.

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:46.478
You must know the bass.

00:43:46.478 --> 00:43:48.670
You must know everything
inside the piano part.

00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:50.590
Then, you learn your text.

00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:54.460
Then, you take the text, and
it needs to be placed exactly

00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:56.740
as another voice.

00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:58.480
Just like Bach, you
have all these voices

00:43:58.480 --> 00:43:59.920
going in counterpoint.

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:01.690
So the voice that
I'm speaking actually

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:04.270
becomes another
voice in the score.

00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:06.790
And it's placed exactly
at the right place.

00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:10.600
Then I have to give you
complete natural inflection.

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:13.390
So that, even though now I'm
acting to you as an actor

00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:16.930
or I'm talking to you, the
moment I go to the instrument,

00:44:16.930 --> 00:44:20.080
I have to somehow give the
illusion that the actor is

00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:21.730
still talking or the
character is still

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:24.910
talking when, in effect, I have
turned a completely different

00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:26.140
system on.

00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:28.300
And that system
is, the mechanism

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:29.800
needs to work
automatically here,

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:34.540
just as I did with that
Beethoven, with the sonata.

00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:35.990
And there's even worse ones.

00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:38.160
In the "Sonata
Pathetique"-- here.

00:44:39.868 --> 00:44:43.460

00:44:50.941 --> 00:44:54.050
(NORMAL SPEECH) It's
exactly in rhythm,

00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:56.060
the sense that something
is terribly wrong.

[MUSIC - BEETHOVEN, "SONATA

00:45:10.444 --> 00:45:15.730
(ACCENTED) The
onset was insidious.

00:45:15.730 --> 00:45:18.172
It began with a
terrible pounding.

00:45:18.172 --> 00:45:19.660
(ROUGH PLAYING)

00:45:22.636 --> 00:45:34.770
Then, there was a
muffling of sound,

00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:37.635
an incessant ringing
and buzzing in the ears.

00:45:37.635 --> 00:45:55.860
[MUSIC - BEETHOVEN, "SONATA
 PATHETIQUE"]

00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:58.770
Something very
terrible was beginning

00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:00.090
to happen to his hearing.

00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:07.925
And the only thing he could
do was cry out in pain.

00:46:11.607 --> 00:46:13.740
(NORMAL SPEECH) And so,
everything is structured.

00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:17.260
Now, what is happening is,
I'm talking directly to you.

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:20.290
I looked at the keys only
when I absolutely needed to.

00:46:20.290 --> 00:46:23.390
But I'm talking to you
while I'm doing this.

00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:25.000
So the sound is going on.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.550
This story is relating
to the color of sound.

00:46:27.550 --> 00:46:29.870
In my eye, as I
am looking at you,

00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:34.000
I am seeing the score of
Beethoven's page and the words

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.430
right exactly where
they need to be.

00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:40.510
But the craft I have developed
to such a degree, whereby

00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:43.600
I am giving you the illusion
that that person is actually

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:48.280
talking off the fly right then
and there about those notes.

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:50.950
It has taken me 25 years
to figure out how to do it.

00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:53.680
And everybody who comes
says, oh, I play the piano.

00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:54.900
And I talk to the audience.

00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:55.850
I'm going to do this.

00:46:55.850 --> 00:46:56.230
It's easy.

00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:56.650
It's fun.

00:46:56.650 --> 00:46:57.820
I said, yeah, give it a shot.

00:46:57.820 --> 00:46:58.262
Haha.

00:46:58.262 --> 00:46:58.761
Let's see.

00:46:58.761 --> 00:46:59.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:59.590 --> 00:47:01.340
Because it looks so simple.

00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:04.570
But again, in terms of
technology and understanding,

00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:07.720
it's finding the simplicity
in all this complexity

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:12.190
and tearing away how
complex all of this is

00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:16.040
and making it direct, keeping
the illusion exactly as it is.

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:17.920
And I still keep
fighting with that

00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:20.920
to try and make that even
better and better and better.

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:22.910
But people talk about
inventing the form.

00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:24.520
So if I did, that's great.

00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:26.589
I hope people follow
along and do it

00:47:26.589 --> 00:47:27.880
and tell these kind of stories.

00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:28.963
Because they're important.

00:47:28.963 --> 00:47:30.790
And audiences want to hear them.

00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:33.790
And if I've learned anything
over all these years,

00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:37.020
it's that what engages
people above all--

00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:38.830
and I know you know this too--

00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:41.080
it's not the actual
technology, it's

00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:43.270
the story as it relates
to the technology,

00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:45.070
as it relates to the human.

00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:45.920
It's the story.

00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:47.050
It's the human story.

00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:48.760
And that's what makes
the difference, not

00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:52.990
the actual numbers and how they
jive to make something happen.

00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:54.730
Because ultimately,
what interconnects

00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:56.530
us are our stories.

00:47:56.530 --> 00:47:59.030
And if we don't have that,
then we're simply not human.

00:47:59.030 --> 00:48:01.580
So that's the interesting thing.

00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:04.750
And what I find interesting is
everybody said, oh, now we're

00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:06.160
going to have little screens.

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:07.540
And people will be plugged in.

00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:09.820
And the whole world
will be in the screen.

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:12.970
The interesting thing is
what technology is developing

00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:14.920
is only our
enhancement of things.

00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:17.710
But people are running
back to the theater,

00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:20.020
because they need that
simple human interaction

00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:22.600
after a day of
technology, where we don't

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:23.770
have that human interaction.

00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:25.520
And the other thing
that I've been talking

00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:27.460
about a lot as a
musician-- and I

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:30.130
don't know how you in this room
feel about it or how you work.

00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:33.495
But I've gone to a lot of
really wonderful great places

00:48:33.495 --> 00:48:35.620
where they develop a lot
of CGI stuff, I would say.

00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:37.870
That's sort of my
involvement in Hollywood,

00:48:37.870 --> 00:48:40.100
is going to those
kinds of things,

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:43.860
so taking what you develop
and then going to do that.

00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:46.480
A lot of people are plugged in.

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:48.520
And they are listening
to the loudest things.

00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:50.230
And you walk through the rooms.

00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:52.270
And it's blaring.

00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:53.792
And I'm thinking,
the damage that

00:48:53.792 --> 00:48:55.000
must be doing to the hearing.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.458
I don't know if
you recognize this.

00:48:56.458 --> 00:48:59.260
But going now to a
movie or something,

00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:03.160
don't you think that it's so
much louder than it used to be?

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:05.440
And what else
happens is we are now

00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:10.840
connecting emotional
reaction to decibel level.

00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:11.650
But it's not.

00:49:11.650 --> 00:49:14.230
Emotional reaction is to
thinking and storytelling.

00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:16.300
It's not amount of sound.

00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:18.340
And so I have
largely stayed away

00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:20.710
from plugging myself
in, going to loud clubs,

00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:21.780
and so on and so forth.

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:23.680
Because here's with
lands up happening.

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:26.220
People don't listen
to each other anymore.

00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:28.660
And that's how wars
begin and get worse,

00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:31.190
because you don't hear
what somebody is saying.

00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:34.570
And my biggest fear is that
talking in a room like this,

00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:38.020
people will not hear unless
they're being shouted at.

00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:41.170
And the emotional expression
is about being shouted.

00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:45.250
And what I've learned is, get
1,000, 10,000, 12,000, 100,000

00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:46.390
people in a room.

00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:48.430
Talk to them easily and quietly.

00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:49.330
They will hear you.

00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:52.570
Scream at them, they'll
miss 90% of what you say.

00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:54.300
And it's a very
interesting thing.

00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:56.410
So the notion of young
people being plugged in

00:49:56.410 --> 00:49:58.501
from very early
on, their hearing

00:49:58.501 --> 00:49:59.500
is going to start to go.

00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:01.192
And this very much
so frightens me,

00:50:01.192 --> 00:50:02.650
in terms of the
state of the world.

00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:03.850
It's very simple.

00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:06.137
But hearing is something
we need to maintain

00:50:06.137 --> 00:50:06.970
as much as possible.

00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:09.400
Beethoven is a prime example.

00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:11.652
And just a couple
last questions--

00:50:16.850 --> 00:50:18.705
AUDIENCE: Yeah, two questions.

00:50:18.705 --> 00:50:21.080
First of all, I should say,
I saw your show at the Center

00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:22.640
for Performing Arts
on Sunday evening

00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:24.330
and thought it was
just really terrific--

00:50:24.330 --> 00:50:24.740
HERSHEY FELDER: Thank you.

00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:25.340
AUDIENCE: --very entertaining.

00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:26.720
And I learned a lot
about Beethoven,

00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:28.636
as a person, and his
relationship with his two

00:50:28.636 --> 00:50:31.940
younger brothers and his nephew
and how that kind of interacted

00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:33.820
with his music.

00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:35.570
As an innovator though,
innovators often

00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:37.010
get a lot of pushback.

00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:40.370
They aren't always very well
appreciated and received.

00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:43.020
And Beethoven, I guess,
didn't really perform himself.

00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:45.540
He would have relied on
musicians and producers, sort

00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:47.706
of the music industry, to
carry his music out there.

00:50:47.706 --> 00:50:48.660
HERSHEY FELDER: Mm-hm.

00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:50.035
AUDIENCE: I'm
wondering what kind

00:50:50.035 --> 00:50:52.151
of relationship and
reception he had at the time

00:50:52.151 --> 00:50:52.900
that he was alive.

00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:54.050
He's a superstar now.

00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:58.522
But was he a superstar while he
was alive and doing his music?

00:50:58.522 --> 00:51:00.980
HERSHEY FELDER: Was Beethoven
a superstar when he was alive

00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:02.104
and he was doing his music?

00:51:02.104 --> 00:51:04.460
To a degree, when he
was younger, absolutely.

00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:06.082
And as he got deafer,
more certainly.

00:51:06.082 --> 00:51:07.790
And certainly, with
"The Ninth Symphony,"

00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:09.440
people loved him again.

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:11.644
He was the God of Music.

00:51:11.644 --> 00:51:12.560
There was no question.

00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:13.640
He was after Mozart.

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:14.720
And he was that.

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:17.630
But as an individual, he
was sort of monstrous.

00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:19.634
And people said, at the
end of Beethoven's life,

00:51:19.634 --> 00:51:21.050
that he had totally
lost his mind.

00:51:21.050 --> 00:51:23.660
He was living in total squalor.

00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:25.910
There are stories about
people going to visit him.

00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:30.470
And I told one in this show
about how he had molding food

00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:31.520
all over the floor.

00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:33.410
His place was filthy.

00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:35.540
He didn't take care of anything.

00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:38.970
Rossini went to see him and said
there were leaks in the house.

00:51:38.970 --> 00:51:40.940
It was living in total squalor--

00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:42.920
the great Beethoven.

00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:46.910
And yet, at the
same time, he was

00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:51.350
recognized as being the
greatest musician of his time.

00:51:51.350 --> 00:51:53.060
But people had sort
of discarded him,

00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:55.010
as if he was just
a crazy old madman.

00:51:55.010 --> 00:51:57.920
He had lost all
sense of normalcy.

00:51:57.920 --> 00:51:58.430
He's deaf.

00:51:58.430 --> 00:51:59.630
He's nuts.

00:51:59.630 --> 00:52:02.476
And it's interesting that the
last bit of his life, people

00:52:02.476 --> 00:52:03.600
complained about his music.

00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:05.232
They said, it's
impossible to play.

00:52:05.232 --> 00:52:07.190
Certainly, as I talked
about "The Grosse Fuge,"

00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:09.350
and by that point,
the last years,

00:52:09.350 --> 00:52:12.440
people said that there is no
interest in any of his music.

00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:14.510
It's just the rantings
of a crazy man.

00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:17.600
Today we look at it as being the
greatest advancement probably

00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:20.030
in the history of Western music.

00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:20.870
You know?

00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:22.250
And that's another thing.

00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:22.910
He faced that.

00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:27.020
And he did say this,
when the little boy says,

00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:30.290
nobody understood my piece,
he actually responded.

00:52:30.290 --> 00:52:32.000
Oh, don't look so sad, my boy.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.710
One day, they will
understand it.

00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:36.680
They are just too stupid
to at this point--

00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:39.390
something like that.

00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:42.410
But that goes for anybody who's
going to push the envelope,

00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:43.760
doesn't it?

00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:46.430
And every time I
get a lousy review--

00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:49.010
they're happening less and
less, which is scaring me.

00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:50.120
And here's why.

00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:52.190
When you get a good
review, you think,

00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:53.300
people are getting it now.

00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:54.810
They're not going to
get it in 100 years.

00:52:54.810 --> 00:52:56.226
They're going to
think it's trash.

00:52:56.226 --> 00:52:58.632
So my view is, the
worse the review is now,

00:52:58.632 --> 00:53:00.590
the better off you're
going to be in 100 years.

00:53:00.590 --> 00:53:01.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:04.160
So that's when you hold
up all your lousy reviews.

00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:06.260
And everybody says,
this is sa-da-da-da-da.

00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:07.670
And you say, well, no.

00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:08.390
I know.

00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:11.580
And maybe, in 100 years,
it will be worth something.

00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:14.360
But I think, anybody
who has something new

00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:18.920
and something different
to say will eventually

00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:20.930
encounter that to some degree.

00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:22.400
His was a different problem.

00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:23.180
He was deaf.

00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:25.400
And so he had to live with that.

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:28.670
And before I do just
this last little piece--

00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:31.831
and I do want to thank Steinway
for sending us this piano.

00:53:31.831 --> 00:53:33.830
Because otherwise, there
would be no music here.

00:53:33.830 --> 00:53:38.600
Although, why is there no
piano permanently here?

00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:39.990
Yes, there needs to be one.

00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:40.940
That's another thing.

00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:44.490
Having a piano somewhere
is very important.

00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:46.790
My wife used to say, every
time I go into a house

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:48.800
without a piano, I
get very nervous.

00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:50.360
I wonder about the people.

00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:51.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:54.860
And so, it's like
meeting people with dogs.

00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:55.970
People with dogs are OK.

00:53:55.970 --> 00:53:58.960
People without dogs, you
have to ask a question.

00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:03.050
So Steinway has been
wonderful in supporting me

00:54:03.050 --> 00:54:05.720
for all these years,
by sending pianos

00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:07.160
wherever they are needed.

00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:10.110
And it's really a marvelous,
marvelous organization.

00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:13.320
And it's location all
around the world--

00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:14.450
they take care of pianists.

00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:15.380
And they take care of us.

00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:16.840
And hence, we can
bring you music.

00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:19.550
So thank you the
folks at Steinway.

00:54:19.550 --> 00:54:23.540
Before this last
piece, Beethoven--

00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:27.710
I think of what he said
when he was 31-years-old.

00:54:27.710 --> 00:54:31.720
It was a letter he
wrote to his brothers.

00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:33.620
He was 31.

00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:35.200
And it's 25 years
before he died.

00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:37.783
And there's still an argument
as to whether he sent the letter

00:54:37.783 --> 00:54:40.040
and he got it back or he
never sent the letter at all.

00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:43.870
But it was in his desk
at the end of his life.

00:54:43.870 --> 00:54:45.410
And it went like this.

00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:47.800
And the first time I read
it, it broke my heart.

00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:50.217
Think of this-- 31-years-old.

00:54:50.217 --> 00:54:51.550
And I'll do it in his character.

00:54:51.550 --> 00:54:55.430
(GERMAN ACCENT) Oh,
you men who declare

00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:59.060
me to be malevolent,
stubborn, and misanthropic,

00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:02.450
how gravely you wrong me.

00:55:02.450 --> 00:55:08.450
For you do not know the secret
cause behind the appearance.

00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:12.890
Ever since childhood
onward, my art and my mind

00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:16.370
have tended towards
a gentle benevolence.

00:55:16.370 --> 00:55:21.590
But for the past six years,
since my 26th birthday,

00:55:21.590 --> 00:55:26.240
I have been suffering from
an incurable affliction, only

00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:30.470
aggravated by stupid physicians.

00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:34.340
Year after year, I am deceived
of the hope of an improvement.

00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:36.740
And I am now forced
to contemplate

00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:42.610
the prospect of an illness
that shall never be cured.

00:55:42.610 --> 00:55:45.940
Well then, how can
I possibly admit

00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:50.060
to being defective in
the very sense which

00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:54.760
had been more highly developed
in me than in other men?

00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:57.760
A sense which I had
at once possessed

00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:01.380
in its most perfect form?

00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:07.070
So please, forgive me if
I appear to be difficult.

00:56:07.070 --> 00:56:08.770
But what am I to do?

00:56:08.770 --> 00:56:12.736
Am I to venture out to
a social gathering--

00:56:12.736 --> 00:56:17.490
hm?-- only to say, speak up!

00:56:17.490 --> 00:56:21.393
I cannot hear you!

00:56:21.393 --> 00:56:23.838
I am deaf!

00:56:28.728 --> 00:56:31.510
And because of this,
I have seriously

00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:34.270
considered taking my own life.

00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:39.970
But each time I decide,
in the end, my need

00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:43.090
for my art returns.

00:56:43.090 --> 00:56:47.050
And now, this is the only
thing that shall keep me alive.

00:56:47.050 --> 00:56:48.820
Death shall now
come as he pleases.

00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:51.880
For no longer
shall I invite him.

00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:55.270
And when he does come,
bravely, I shall come out.

00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:58.890
And I shall accept my fate.

00:56:58.890 --> 00:57:02.640
And when this day happens,
I ask of you only one thing.

00:57:05.937 --> 00:57:12.115
Please, do not forget me.

00:57:15.030 --> 00:57:17.940
