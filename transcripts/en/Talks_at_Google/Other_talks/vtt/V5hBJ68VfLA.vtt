00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.208
MALE SPEAKER: Please
welcome Heidi Lee.

00:00:02.208 --> 00:00:03.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.080
HEIDI LEE: Thanks, guys.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.520
So I'm a hat designer.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.450
And I've been fortunate enough
to have a lot of success

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.980
and recognition over the years.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.650
Here are a few of my
hats, as you can see.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.410
And they were showcased at
Silicon Valley Fashion Week

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.200
yesterday.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.900
And I wanted to
actually bring them

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.470
to you, so that you could see
them in person on real people.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.480
And thankfully,
these lovely women

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.887
have been able to
volunteer for me today.

00:00:35.887 --> 00:00:37.720
As you can see, they're
pretty eye-catching.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.110
But behind that, there's a
lot of thought and process

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.950
that goes behind
each of my stories.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.160
And each of them have
a narrative and story

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.640
within their own right.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.906
And I'd like to
share them with you.

00:00:52.906 --> 00:00:56.510
The first hat here is
the Cocktail Parasol hat.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.860
And it's 3D-printed,
laser-centered nylon.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.570
And it's flexible,
as you can see.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.380
And it was based
on Karakasa-Obake.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.640
Which is a legend that dates
back, like, hundreds of years

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.980
ago in Japanese folklore,
where parasols gained souls

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.590
after 100 years.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.580
So I decided to electrocute
the Karakasa-Obake.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.620
And what remains is the boning,
or the architecture of decay.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.810
And that's the origin
story behind this hat.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.440
And this hat garnered
a letter of recognition

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.095
from Harold Koda, the curator
in charge of the Met Museum

00:01:41.095 --> 00:01:43.720
and the Costume Institute, which
is now called the Anna Wintour

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.040
Costume Center.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.010
And that happened in 2012.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.340
And I could say that
was about the same time

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.560
when I really started to get
more serious about endeavoring

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.190
in making more innovative
and creative pieces as a hat

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.382
designer.

00:01:59.382 --> 00:02:01.020
OK, thank you.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.920
You can stay here.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.670
This is the Vortex hat.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.660
And this is also
laser-centered nylon.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.940
And it's inspired by net
art and the internet.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.620
And as you can
see, it's the grid.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.990
So you're literally on the
grid versus off the grid.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.600
And what's cool about
it is that because it's

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.640
like a basic, minimal pattern,
it goes with everything.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.660
And having a background
in graphic design

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.440
at Rhode Island
School of Design,

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.320
I'm pretty used to normally,
like, seeing things on a grid,

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.490
and mapping things,
and aligning things.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.070
So I guess my graphic
design history also--

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.320
you can see that relating
in this hat right here.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.280
And I would say this is one
of my more popular pieces

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.000
right now.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.210
And what's great about nylon
is that you can color-match it

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.010
to any Pantone color.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.510
So I also have glow-in-the-dark
versions as well.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.570
No black light needed.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.520
And this is a special hat
collaboration with Adam Harvey,

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.250
who's a surveillance artist.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.850
He had a full-page "New
York Times" article

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.670
about the work that
he's been doing.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.100
And he's very
innovative in trying

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.110
to bridge the gap between
technology and art,

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.920
and where it's going.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.270
He's done conferences
with Snowden.

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:37.290
And he's trying to make
aware, more and more, the fact

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.110
that we're constantly
being surveillanced

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.770
and how big brother
is watching you.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:49.000
As you can see, this hat,
that's where your eyes align,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.700
and the nose bridge-- like, you
can see all the sacred geometry

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.010
happening right now.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.110
And it has a Buckminster
Fuller-like geodesic dome

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.440
kind of structure in the back.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:07.040
And it's made, so
that it can be worn.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.310
And it blocks face
detection in computers.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.400
So this is a prototype.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.550
And it first debuted at
the New Museum Demo Day

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.420
in January, this past January.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.410
And we're going through
second and third rounds soon.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.720
And it's been
presented in the FBI,

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.440
and there's a lot
of interest in it,

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:36.670
because people want to
avoid being seen by everyone

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:37.700
and being recognized.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.840
So there you go.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.690
This is the Ampersand hat.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.005
And--

00:04:45.005 --> 00:04:45.920
FEMALE SPEAKER: Ah.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.220
HEIDI LEE: Oh, sorry.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.190
It's a combination between an
at symbol and an ampersand.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.840
And it was commissioned by
"The New Republic" magazine.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:55.950
It's a political magazine.

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:03.590
And it was recently just
bought by a Facebook founder.

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.600
But anyways, they
commissioned me

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.230
to create any piece that
had any ampersand in it

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.960
for their Books
and the Arts page.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:18.000
So I decided to show
where things are going.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.580
Like, things are becoming
more and more digital.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.000
And just 3D printing, too, the
marvelous aspects behind it

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.560
is the fact that you can create
something out of nothing.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.610
And things that you could
normally not print or create

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.160
any other way are possible
through 3D printing.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:43.780
And I decided to make a
combination of an ampersand

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.330
and an at symbol, and create
a whole new symbol, or emoji,

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.450
you could say.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:56.617
And I'm going to also make an at
symbol hat to go with this one.

00:05:56.617 --> 00:05:57.116
Yeah.

00:05:57.116 --> 00:05:58.970
FEMALE SPEAKER: Cool.

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.010
HEIDI LEE: And this
is the Echo hat.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.720
And I've gotten a lot
of press from this,

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.010
because it's just a showstopper,
and people are really

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:07.550
curious about it.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.370
Especially at the Silicon
Valley Fashion Week,

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.880
this had the most attention,
and people were, like,

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.132
cheering really hard.

00:06:15.132 --> 00:06:18.740
So can you demonstrate for us?

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.290
So she's going to do a 360.

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.540
And as you can see, there's
eight faces that go around.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:31.120
And this is also
kind of commentary

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.780
on how we live in a
surveillance age as well,

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.810
and how we live in
the age of the selfie,

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:40.430
and how people are
really consumed

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.320
with the idea of Facebook.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.990
And Facebook is there
really a book of faces.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.670
So it all ties in, in that way.

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:50.210
And it's a critique
on how we live

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.890
in a society of that,
as well as it references

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:58.350
Greek and Roman mythology, the
story of Echo and Narcissus,

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:03.310
of how Echo, this woodland
nymph, yearns for Narcissus.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:07.520
But Narcissus instead,
like, falls in love

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.090
with his own reflection.

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.330
So I love that
mythological story.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:18.010
And they're always like-- I
felt really in tune with it

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:18.640
as a kid.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.110
So I wanted to
create a piece that

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.790
was referencing that-- like
mythological, ancient story

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:28.990
with something modern, too,
with this new technique

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.070
in 3D printing of
laser-centered nylon, which

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:33.210
is high-resolution.

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.290
And you can get
really fine details

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.630
that you couldn't get otherwise.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.740
So thank you.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.100
And this is the
Atomic Universe hat.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:47.080
And I was really
fascinated with the idea

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.930
of the Big Bang in
physics, because I never

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:51.710
studied that as a kid.

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:55.950
And I wanted to make a
visual representation

00:07:55.950 --> 00:08:04.730
of how electrons would, like,
flow and spin around a nucleus.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:07.530
So this is an actual
representation

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:12.070
of ladies representing
electrons, you could say.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:17.580
And as you can see,
it's very trippy.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.180
And depending on how you
permutate your head--

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:23.440
like how you drop
your head around--

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.887
it also those
different orbital--

00:08:24.887 --> 00:08:25.678
AUDIENCE: Oh, nice.

00:08:25.678 --> 00:08:27.390
HEIDI LEE: --yeah, movements.

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:28.476
So yeah.

00:08:28.476 --> 00:08:28.976
See?

00:08:28.976 --> 00:08:30.184
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:30.184 --> 00:08:31.600
Yeah, if you turn
down the lights,

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.332
maybe you guys could see better.

00:08:33.332 --> 00:08:38.780
But yeah, this is a really
fun showstopper, too.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:45.530
[CHUCKLES] So yeah, those
are just some of these hats.

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:47.220
And this is the
letter of recognition

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:51.810
that I got from Harold Koda,
which I was really lucky enough

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:52.460
to be part of.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.550
It was a nationwide contest
that was open to all design

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.100
students in America.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:03.890
And it was in conjunction with
the Elsa Schiaparelli and Prada

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:10.730
exhibition on how
Schiaparelli and Prada really

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:13.300
felt deeply connected
to each other because

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:17.440
of their love of art, and
fashion, and surrealism.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.510
So as you can see,
a lot of my hats

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:22.930
have homages to
surrealism happening.

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:25.470
And this cocktail
parasol hat-- like,

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.610
I guess you could
say I Duchamped it.

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:33.390
Like, just how like Marcel
Duchamp took a bicycle wheel

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:34.840
and put it in
different contexts,

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.750
and put it on the stool, he
created a monumental piece

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:39.730
of artwork.

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:44.510
Like, I feel like putting
an umbrella on a headband,

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:47.940
it's kind of similar
in the same aspects.

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:52.480
So I wanted to also show
you some of my other hats

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.280
that weren't able
to be here today.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.120
So you can kind of do-- you
could see a scope of some

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.550
of my other stuff.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:03.320
This is the Echo hat again.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.480
And I also have a
mirrored version

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.530
that was chromed by the
same chromers as Jeff Koons.

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:13.350
And it has a very hall
of mirrors aspect to it.

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:17.290
And it really plays with
the double entendre of who's

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:19.390
watching who really, literally.

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:22.320
And you get to see
yourself in the mirror

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:28.380
as well as see other people
around you at the same time.

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:31.810
This is a piece that I
did for Victor Osborne.

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:34.170
He's also a milliner
that has done

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:38.450
commissioned pieces for
Tom Brown, and [INAUDIBLE],

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:41.420
and a few other top designers.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:45.440
That's how I kind of started
off-- apprenticing under him.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:49.950
And he gave me an opportunity
to make an origami hat out

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:54.390
of paper, but a miniature
version that was sent out

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:59.380
to accessory editors at "Vogue,"
"GQ," "W," "Harper's Bazaar,"

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.880
all the top editors.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.960
And they were able to get
this mini hat box invite.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:09.670
And in exchange,
they had a free hat.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:13.470
So that was the interesting,
like, box of curiosities,

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:17.070
you could say,
that they received.

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:21.520
What's cool about this
is the origins of origami

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.810
like [INAUDIBLE] which
is a type of magic that's

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:30.280
made with paper, you can
transform these shapes

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.060
into many different shapes.

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:35.320
Like for example, this can
be worn three different ways.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:41.680
So I was playing with the idea
of how Houdini even used to use

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:42.460
[INAUDIBLE].

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:45.500
And I wanted to
make that into a hat

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.296
and make it into an
interesting curiosity keepsake.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:56.370
That's me with the few
additions that I had created.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:58.518
This is the Fencing Bonnet hat.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:07.930
It's made out of this material
called [? cineme. ?] And you

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.650
can mold it with your hands.

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:15.550
And by the heat of your hands
and spraying it with water,

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:19.410
you can transform the material
into different shapes.

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:24.610
And I also worked with my uncle,
who's also a hat designer.

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:27.540
And he's been in the
industry for over 30 years.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:31.565
So I was able to grasp a lot
from working with him as well.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.800
And these hats are currently
being pulled by "Vogue Italia."

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.020
Shot by Steven Meisel
for a shoot that's

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.600
coming up next month.

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:49.700
Again, that's the Ampersand
hat in black and white.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.830
This is the Redrum hat.

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:55.820
And it's plastic that
was melted with a heat

00:12:55.820 --> 00:13:00.495
gun in the organic shape
that you see right there.

00:13:03.108 --> 00:13:06.000
This is the Dali hat.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.400
It's inspired by Salvador
Dali and his "Persistence

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.770
of Memory."

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:15.810
And I made a special commission
version for Lady Gaga,

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:23.180
where it's a holographic time
hat on the right-hand side.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:27.240
So I use this holographic
film to use as a base layer,

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:33.012
and then vinyl lettered the
Roman numerals afterwards.

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:40.210
This is this interesting
material called horsehair.

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:47.060
And what's cool about it is
that once you sew it in half,

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:51.930
you can pull at it,
and it starts curving,

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:54.350
and it becomes a swirl.

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:56.950
So this is called a
swirl hat on the left.

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:59.780
And then this is a
Cone Bra hat, which

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:04.090
is inspired by Jean
Paul Gaultier's corset

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:08.440
that Madonna wore
for "Truth or Dare."

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.320
The Cone Bra hat
was commissioned

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:17.740
by the Brooklyn Museum for me
to lead a 50-people class that

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:19.297
was like sold out.

00:14:19.297 --> 00:14:20.880
So that was a really
great opportunity

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.960
that happened in 2014.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:29.630
It was also in conjunction with
the international exhibition

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:32.560
retrospective of
Jean Paul Gaultier.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.230
These are some
other colors, waves.

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:39.820
And in conjunction with the
small Cocktail Parasol hat,

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:43.390
I also had this big
Parasol Skeleton hat.

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:45.130
So it's a jumbo version.

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:49.250
And those two garner the
award for the Met Museum.

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:51.550
Also different color waves--
red, white, and blue.

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:54.020
Trying to be patriotic.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.140
A black version.

00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:00.745
And then different color waves
for the Cocktail Parasol hat.

00:15:00.745 --> 00:15:04.430
The one on the right
is the Vortex hat.

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:07.115
Different color waves.

00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:10.750
The one on the right here
is called A Wrinkle In Time.

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:17.020
And it's leather that is
embedded with these sparkles.

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:24.450
So I thought it, very much,
was-- I was envisioning space

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:26.630
and how space folds.

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:28.460
And what's interesting
about this hat

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:33.150
is that the whole
piece is folded

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:39.470
to make the circular,
dome-like aspect of the piece.

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:41.360
So it's almost
like a planetarium

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.390
of a hat or a holodeck.

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:45.870
If you look on the
inside, the grow grain

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:49.910
that surrounds the ribbon has
planetary-- like Milky Way

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:53.990
constellations
enwrapping your head.

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:57.590
This is called the Aerial hat.

00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:00.420
And as you can see, it has
a blue-green iridescence

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:04.050
on the left and like a
pinkish, like sea foam,

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:06.780
like frushia going on.

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:14.970
It's a combination of a
baseball cap with a cowboy top.

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:19.360
So I was kind of
hacking that idea.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.590
This is the Aerial Finn hat.

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:25.650
This is also the same
blue-green iridescence, too.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:32.170
It's the same leather that Comme
des Garcons made their wallets

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:32.670
with.

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:36.132
It's the same iridescence.

00:16:36.132 --> 00:16:38.720
The one on the right
is the Third Eye hat.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:44.350
And they're made of real
photopolymer holograms.

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:46.220
About 130.

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:53.483
And the base of the hat, too,
is also rainbow holograms.

00:16:53.483 --> 00:16:54.482
So it's all holographic.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.430
This is the Singularity hat.

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:02.580
And as you can see, it's
like a motherboard pattern.

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:05.589
And it's a little,
like, old school style.

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:08.440
But I like the idea
of mixing old and new.

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:14.910
At the time, I was
reading Ray Kurzweil's

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:16.880
"The Singularity" book.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:21.740
And I was really faced
with the concerns of what

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.660
singularity might look like.

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:29.960
So the idea of biological and
technological coming together,

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:34.570
and the idea of a
lenticular having two sides,

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:38.410
of a double-edged sword,
like, being the same thing.

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:41.670
I thought that was really
fitting to make these hats.

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:44.110
Yeah.

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:46.150
As you can see, that's
the Atomic Universe hat

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:49.310
on the left, and then
the Body Electric hat.

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:52.470
And it's inspired
by Walt Whitman's "I

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:55.230
Sing the Body Electric" poem.

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:58.780
If you have a chance, I highly
recommend you guys reading it.

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:00.340
It's a wonderful poem.

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:04.910
And it's made with
addressable LEDs

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:07.640
that all kind of speak
the same language

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:11.400
of this rainbow, melting
colors that are happening.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:19.410
And it was featured in a show
studio punk film last year.

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:22.870
And it featured
[INAUDIBLE], a supermodel

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:25.823
who is now the face of L'Oreal.

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:32.110
This is the Glass hat.

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:35.630
And it's inspired
by coral reefs.

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:38.220
And it's a piece
of antique glass

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:41.900
that I re-appropriated and
created into a hat piece.

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.130
This is the Cocktail
Parasol hat in red.

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:50.650
But it's amazing to see
my stuff actually used

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:52.180
in editorials and stuff.

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:55.780
It was like, that's the very
fulfilling part about doing

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:59.150
this-- seeing it in a
whole different context

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:04.440
from different eyes and
different artistic directors.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.780
So this is a few of my
press that I've gotten.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:08.000
End of Century.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.780
There was a show
called "Gallery Girls"

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:14.270
that featured my hats
on television for Bravo.

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:15.600
This is the Redrum hat.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.320
And "redrum" is "murder"
spelled backwards.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.180
So I liked the idea
of how it looked

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:23.700
like blood that was
coagulating and becoming

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.490
this mass of cells.

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:29.690
So yeah.

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:35.120
The Parasol Skeleton Hat,
the year that I created it,

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:36.660
garnered a lot of attention.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:38.150
It was in "The New York Times."

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:41.750
And the next day after
this on the left,

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:46.620
it was featured in Bill
Cunningham's Sunday Style page.

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:49.060
And as you can see,
the girl on the right,

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:50.810
she's wearing a
Mini Origami hat.

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.370
The hat on the left is
called the Carnal Floral hat.

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:05.830
And it's made of plastic flowers
that were all pieced together

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:08.310
kind of like ikebani.

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:12.070
I forget the exact word
of how you arrange flowers

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:15.890
in Japanese flower arrangements.

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:17.450
I think it's called ikebana.

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:20.480
But anyways, yeah, that
was the inspiration--

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:28.330
to make something really out
of this world and bizarre,

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:33.020
almost taxidermied, but
in a plant-like way.

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:38.570
And the picture on the right--
I was featured in "W" magazine.

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:41.352
And I'm wearing the
Melting Clock hat.

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:46.890
These are special hats
that I created that have

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:49.686
LEDs where the eyes are.

00:20:49.686 --> 00:20:51.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:55.120
And then this isn't a
very-- Michelle Harper,

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.670
she's like a fashion muse.

00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:00.840
I had the great
privilege of her wearing

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:01.877
my hat for an editorial.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:08.730
So yeah, these are
some other hats.

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:11.850
Do you guys have any questions?

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:12.640
Or want to--

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.556
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:13.556 --> 00:21:14.911
HEIDI LEE: Oh, sorry.

00:21:14.911 --> 00:21:17.857
AUDIENCE: [CHATTER]

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:21.220
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.704
Question here.

00:21:23.704 --> 00:21:25.870
AUDIENCE: So I've actually--
I've been following you

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:26.720
for a long time.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.600
I'm a big fan.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.040
HEIDI LEE: Oh, really?

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:28.920
AUDIENCE: Um, yes.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:33.070
I was wondering if you were
ever going to do any clothing,

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:35.690
or if you're just going
to stick with hats?

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:39.410
HEIDI LEE: I want to
be known for hats first

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:42.820
and then slowly enter
other realms, too.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:46.440
In fashion, clothing is
a natural progression.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.189
So definitely keep your
eyes peeled for me.

00:21:49.189 --> 00:21:49.730
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:50.230
Cool.

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:51.282
HEIDI LEE: Yeah.

00:21:51.282 --> 00:21:53.240
AUDIENCE: So thank you
for-- thanks for coming.

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.800
The stuff's beautiful.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.744
HEIDI LEE: Thanks
for being here.

00:21:56.744 --> 00:21:58.160
AUDIENCE: So I
guess my question--

00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.360
I have a two-part question.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.300
So like, why did
you start with hats,

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:05.280
and why was that your
beginning fashion piece,

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:08.474
and why is that your
staple of your work?

00:22:08.474 --> 00:22:09.470
HEIDI LEE: OK.

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:13.740
I could say hats, in a lot of
ways-- you could see them--

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:17.770
as a child at least, it
was a bit of comfort,

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:20.870
like a pillow or a
security blanket.

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:26.970
It gives you a sense of
belonging to something.

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:32.090
And no matter what
context you're in,

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:34.620
you can still have
your own thinking space

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:40.160
and your own-- bring to the
table a piece of yourself.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.770
So that's what I like about it.

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:43.910
So no matter what
matrix you're in,

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:46.690
you're still in
your own head space.

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:49.210
So that's what I
like about hats.

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:52.880
And you know, wearing
a hat, your mind

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.770
is connected to it as well.

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:58.625
So it's interconnected.

00:22:58.625 --> 00:22:59.250
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:00.840
And the second part
of the question

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.770
was, it looks like
fashion's going pretty

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:04.140
digital these days, right?

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:09.270
So do you see that
becoming a bigger trend?

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:13.010
And then what's the
future of digital LEDs,

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:15.714
and lighting, and
movement within fashion?

00:23:15.714 --> 00:23:16.380
HEIDI LEE: Yeah.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:20.880
I believe in the idea of the
new aesthetic, that coined term,

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:25.220
where the digital is becoming
more and more physical.

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:28.010
So as you can see,
3D printing, it

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:32.640
starts with a vector
file and a file

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.330
that becomes something real.

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:40.190
So yeah, your imagination
is the limits.

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:44.360
Anything can happen, really,
when you put your imagination

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:45.290
into reality.

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:49.425
And 3D printing is the medium.

00:23:49.425 --> 00:23:51.210
AUDIENCE: It seems
3D printing and body

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:53.910
scanning are these fantastic
tools for creating really

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:56.100
personalized pieces,
which is something,

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:58.300
I guess, in like the
modern, commoditized world,

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:01.370
that things are made
for millions of people

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:02.930
to be as cheap as possible.

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:05.910
But what do you think it would
take before the 3D printing

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:08.500
and body scanning can
actually be used at, like,

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:10.042
a large scale?

00:24:10.042 --> 00:24:12.250
HEIDI LEE: I think that
there's a lot of patents that

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:14.170
are expiring hopefully soon.

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:18.260
So it'll become more and more
affordable for normal people

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:21.740
to wear and have access to.

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:26.110
As you can see, there's already
places like Kinko's and stuff

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:27.730
that have 3D printers.

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:31.250
And I can see over there,
right there, like a MakerBot.

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:34.700
And that's a little bit
more low-resolution,

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:35.793
like plastic extrusion.

00:24:35.793 --> 00:24:39.380
But there's going to be more
and more options coming out

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:44.770
in the market as competition
makes things more affordable.

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:47.020
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
if you could talk a bit more

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:47.820
about the process.

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:51.045
Like, you started talking a bit
about the different resolutions

00:24:51.045 --> 00:24:52.170
of 3D printing or whatever.

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:53.920
But like, say if someone
wanted to try out

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:58.060
nylon printing or something,
like how you might go about it.

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:00.160
HEIDI LEE: Well, this
is nylon printing.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.930
So it starts off
in a bed of powder.

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:07.860
And your file, once you
put it in, layer by layer,

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:12.090
the lasers go through and center
the nylon, which is melting it.

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:16.710
So afterwards, after
they print it all,

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:18.310
they dust off all the powder.

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:22.130
And what remains is kind of
like an archeological dig.

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:25.257
You find this piece,
and it's ready to go.

00:25:25.257 --> 00:25:26.840
AUDIENCE: Do you
feel like the process

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:30.165
is any different for a
fashion sort of-- these kinds

00:25:30.165 --> 00:25:32.290
of statements that you are
doing versus other stuff

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:33.597
that people are making?

00:25:33.597 --> 00:25:35.180
HEIDI LEE: Well, I
think the way to go

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:39.050
if you're doing high
fashion is flexible nylon,

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:42.520
3D-printed stuff, because it's
the most wearable out there,

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:43.620
I would say.

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:49.110
And yeah, also, it's
extremely high-resolution.

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:53.820
The low-resolution stuff,
you can see the lines,

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:58.460
and you can see little
strings coming out and stuff.

00:25:58.460 --> 00:25:59.470
You can see the quality.

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:01.800
It's obvious, because
the printer costs, like,

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:05.140
half a million dollars, the
ones that you see here today.

00:26:08.761 --> 00:26:10.760
AUDIENCE: I'm curious
about how you got started,

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:14.280
and what type of work you
did before you went to RISD,

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.560
and how many of these
pieces were made

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:19.932
while you were a student there?

00:26:19.932 --> 00:26:21.890
HEIDI LEE: Initially,
when I moved to New York,

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:23.970
I was working for
a multimillionaire,

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:27.730
a luxury real estate marketing
company called [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:30.840
And we would kind of
dream up crazy ideas

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:34.260
of creating artificial
islands in Dubai,

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:38.870
and imagining what the
resort would look like,

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:43.840
and how the spas would be
underwater, and such like that.

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:49.010
So it was pretty
intense and interesting

00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:52.980
working with buildings that
Philippe Starck designed

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:58.040
and Jade Jagger, to
name a few, in W Hotels.

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.340
But at the end of
the day, I felt

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:03.630
like I wanted to do something
more fulfilling and more

00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:09.930
personal, and wanted to share
my stories through these hats,

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:11.810
as you can see.

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:14.240
And initially, I
didn't really know

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.860
I was going to get
into hat design.

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:17.970
I just kind of stumbled upon it.

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:21.610
And it started off apprenticing
under Victor Osborne,

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:22.940
the milliner.

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:26.650
And then I started just
creating my hats little

00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:30.300
by little over that time period,
starting with the origami hats,

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:33.510
and then creating more
functional pieces.

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:37.490
And I feel like my stuff tries
to bridge the gap between art,

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:40.240
and fashion, and design
all at the same time.

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.970
So each of my hats,
you could say,

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:45.240
are statement pieces,
because each of them

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.400
have strong concepts
behind them.

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.990
Yeah.

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:53.600
AUDIENCE: On average,
how long does it

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:57.520
tend to take you, with your
entire creative process--

00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:59.802
from the ideas,
sketching it out--

00:27:59.802 --> 00:28:02.010
I don't know what other
steps are in there-- and then

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:06.620
actually, like, OK,
hat's 3D-printed?

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:09.150
HEIDI LEE: I could
say, coming from RISD,

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:11.800
they train you to have
a really sharp eye.

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:16.670
And also, it doesn't help that
I'm a bit of a perfectionist.

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:20.460
So it takes me lots and
lots of rounds and revisions

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:23.540
to get to the level
that you see here today.

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:26.300
So it's like trial and error.

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:29.990
And if it doesn't fit, you
try again and again and again.

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:31.640
And then you hone it.

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:36.190
And it becomes an
actual, sellable product.

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:39.330
So that's one way,
as you can see.

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:42.640
AUDIENCE: Is that
like months or--

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.820
HEIDI LEE: Every hat
has its own process.

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:47.760
Some hats-- like just
like making a hit song.

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:48.630
You never know.

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:52.160
It could take a couple days,
or it could take a month

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:57.110
or like-- it has its own
wavelength of process,

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:59.040
I could say.

00:28:59.040 --> 00:28:59.772
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:28:59.772 --> 00:29:01.480
I was wondering, what
sort of constraints

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:04.705
do you give yourself when you're
thinking about a new design?

00:29:07.329 --> 00:29:08.870
HEIDI LEE: It
definitely is something

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:15.500
that is palpable for people,
but then still striking.

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:21.970
Like, I want to make
something that is something

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:25.760
that a consumer would
want in general,

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:28.730
and maybe satiate the
masses in that sense,

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:35.850
but then also have the
integrity of ergonomics,

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:39.214
like design and function.

00:29:39.214 --> 00:29:40.880
AUDIENCE: As you can
see, in this space,

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:44.280
The Garage here is kind
of like a scrappy place

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:48.310
that we use to prototype
and brainstorm.

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:51.560
I was wondering how you
deal with a space like this

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:54.770
or what's in your
creative process?

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:59.810
Do you have a specific space
where you ideate this stuff?

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:04.060
HEIDI LEE: I feel, to be honest,
at ease in this kind of space,

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:06.920
like a working space, because
making some of my hats--

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:09.720
for example, the
Echo hat, it took

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:13.150
a lot of priming, and sanding,
and priming-- like days

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:14.220
and days of doing that.

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:16.850
And it would be in a
workspace like this, where

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:19.790
I would actually do it myself.

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:25.180
Right now, I don't have, at
my leisure, many interns.

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:27.920
So I do most of the work myself.

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:31.320
So as you can see,
getting it to that point,

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:33.040
it was a lot of
my own hand labor.

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:36.850
So being in a real raw, like
hands-on space like this,

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:39.590
that's where I feel at
ease and comfortable.

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:40.090
Yeah.

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:41.300
AUDIENCE: Back to you.

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:42.710
HEIDI LEE: Cool.

00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:43.520
Thanks for coming.

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:44.720
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.220
MALE SPEAKER: Sweet.

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:47.770
HEIDI LEE: Yeah.
