00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.420
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: Good
afternoon everyone and thanks

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.570
for joining us today for
our Books and Beyond.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.440
I'm Guy Lamolinara and I'm
from the Center for the Book

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.520
in the Library of Congress.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.080
The Center for the Book is
a division of the Library

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.730
that promotes books, reading,
libraries and literacy

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.000
and we also administer here at the
library the young reader center

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.810
in the Jefferson building and
poetry and literature center,

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.180
which is also in the
Jefferson building

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.980
and which recently named a new
poet laureate, Juan Felipe Herrera.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.170 position:56%
Additionally, we administer the
Library of Congress' literacy awards

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.980
and will be announcing new
winners this fall in October.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.490
The way we carry out our mission
nationwide is with the assistance

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:07.170
of our affiliated centers
for the book.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.520
We have a center for the book in
every state in Washington, DC.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.630
And if you're traveling to
the Virgin Islands I recommend

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.480
that you visit the Virgin
Islands Center for the Book,

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.050
they will greet you
very warmly there.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.350
We also have a partnership of
80 like-minded organizations

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.160
and they play an important role

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.030
in helping us fulfill
our mission as well.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.350
We also are a big part of
the National Book Festival,

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.230
which this year is September 5th
in the Washington Convention Center

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.530
and I urge you to attend

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.340
that if you've never attended
before, it's a great event.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.280
And you can find out more
about it at LOC.gov/bookfest.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.160
Before we get started I ask that
you please turn off all your

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.910
electronic devices.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.460
And I need to let you know that
we're filming this for a webcast,

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.380
so if you ask a question you
will become part of that webcast.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.360
And those webcasts are available
on our website which is read.gov

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.840
and you can find more than 200
of those webcasts on that site

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.220
and they cover a broad range
of topics and subjects.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.880
So pretty much any kind
of topic you're interested

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.830
in you will find on
that webcast site.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.730
I should tell you that today's
author's book will be for sale

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.510
at the entrance to this room.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.650
And following the presentation
he will sign the book

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.140
at the table located at
the back of the room.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.980
And you'll also get a chance to
talk to him more about his work.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.500
The chief criterion that we use in
selecting books for our series is

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.290
that there must be a strong
connection with the Library

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.320
of Congress and that
usually means in most cases

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.980
that the writer did research here,

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.320
which is certainly the
case with our author today.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.950
And today's author presentation
by the way is cosponsored

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.960
with our manuscript division,
which brought this to us.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.940
So thank you for doing that.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.790
And with us from the manuscript
division is Adrienne Cannon

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.510 position:56%
who is the Afro-American history and
culture specialist for the division

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.090
and she has been in
that role since 1996.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.680
Her duties include developing

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.090
and promoting the division's
African-American collections

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.230
and providing reference
services to researchers.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.370 position:56%
She helped strengthen the library's
unparalleled resources for the study

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.890
of 20th-century civil rights
movement and the acquisition

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.150
of the papers of Jackie Robinson,
Louis Martin, Leon Sullivan,

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.900
James Foreman, Herbert
Hill and Roger Wilkins.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.340
Adrienne also was the lead
curator for a current exhibition

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.160
that I really urge you to go see,
it's the Civil Rights Act of 1964,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.700
a long struggle for freedom.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.760
And she was the curator of the 2010
online presentation NAACP Century

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.670
in the Fight for Freedom.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.850
Adrienne was a co-lead
curator for a 2004 exhibition

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.070
With an Even Hand,
Brown versus Board F50.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.420
Adrienne came to library from
a position as associate curator

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.230
in the Special Collections
Department

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.980
at the University of
Virginia Library.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.870
She also worked for the
Smithsonian Institution

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.180
and the African-American Museum in
Philadelphia and she is a graduate

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.980
of Oberlin College
and Brown University.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.510
Please welcome Adrienne Cannon
who will introduce our speaker.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:31.060
[ Applause ]

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.520
&gt;&gt; Adrienne Cannon: Good
afternoon and thank you Guy

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.240
for that gracious introduction.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.810
It's my pleasure to
introduce James McGrath Morris

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.170
who will discuss his new
best-selling biography,

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.880
Eye on the Struggle, Ethel Payne,
The First Lady of Black Press.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.330
Ethel Payne was the
Washington correspondent

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.910 position:56%
for the Chicago Defender and
syndicated columnist with Sengstacke

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.250
and Afro-American newspaper chains.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.510
She made history as the
first African-American woman

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:08.120
to be included in the White
House press corps, become a radio

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.760
and television commentator
on a national network CBS,

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.900
and cover the Vietnam War.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.260
She was respected for her
coverage of civil rights

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.930
and international affairs,
but not widely known.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.240
Ethel Payne was as professor

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.490
and author Paula Giddings
observed quote,

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.830
a pioneer who experienced the
challenges but little of the glory

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.890
that comes with the title.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:44.310
With this book her legacy
is assured unquote."

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:53.370 position:56%
Khalil Gibran Mohammed noted in his
review for the New York times quote,

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.710
Morris has written a fast-paced,

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.350
engrossing biography weaving
the details of Payne's personal

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.230
and infinitely intriguing
professional life

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.730
against the backdrop of
20th-century race relations,

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:11.650
the civil rights movement and
Cold War anti-colonialism.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:17.060
In the Washington Post book review
Elizabeth Varon commended quote

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.090
Morris' research on Payne as
meticulous and exhaustive.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.170
The biography draws not only on
her writings and recollections,

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.730 position:56%
but also on those of her colleagues,
employers, readers, rivals,

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.840
students, family and friends.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:39.100 position:56%
Mr. Morris conducted much of his
research in the manuscript division,

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.350
which is the home of approximately
63 million primary source documents

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.960
of American history and culture
spanning the colonial period

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.380
to the present.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.720
The manuscript division
holds the papers of more

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.470
than 200 reporters,
editors and publishers.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:58.320
Counted among these holdings
are the papers of Ethel Payne,

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.420

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:40.920
Mr. Morris presented that biography

of the Biographers
International Organization.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:48.510
Please join me in welcoming
James McGrath Morris.

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:55.070
[ Applause ]

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:58.580
&gt;&gt; James McGrath Morris:
That was a surprising honor,

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.900
I hear praises all the time about
the collections you brought here.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.480
And so when you were sitting next

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.670
to me just chatting I had
no idea you were going

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:08.370
to say all these nice
things about me, thank you.

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:12.690
I've learned my lesson the last
time I gave one of these talks here

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:14.500
at the Library of Congress
was the morning

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.940
after Snowmageddon,
do you remember that?

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:21.120
And so I had a real
challenge getting here,

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.420
getting down the streets.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.460
This time my challenge was
getting here not looking

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.230
like I had been in a swimming pool.

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:29.890
So I parked at Union
Station, took off my jacket

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:33.070
and walked really slowly.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:37.220
It is doubly fun and a little
nerve-racking to speak here.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:40.180
The pleasure comes from the
fact that this institution has

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:43.250
so lovingly cared for
Ethel Payne's papers.

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:45.340
And if it weren't for the Library

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.800
of Congress' care this book
couldn't have been written.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.380
The fear factor comes
when I speak in Washington

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.570
and Chicago invariably there
are people who knew Ethel Payne

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:59.210
in the audience, so that
certainly puts me on my toes.

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:02.750
I want to start the story
that I introduce you

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:06.540
to Ethel Payne in February of 1954.

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.470
Obviously, a significant year

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:11.040
because in a few months Brown
v. Board is going to come

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.370
down from the Supreme Court.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:17.240
But on that day Ethel
Payne is an angry soul.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:20.630
She's really furious and she's
on her way to this building,

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:22.830
the old executive office building.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:26.430
And she particularly
wants to speak to this ma.

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:29.180
Eisenhower had been in
the White House for a year

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:32.210
and Republicans were just so happy.

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:34.440
It was the first time
since the depression

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.880
that a Republican inhabited the
White House and as you know,

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.700
control of the White House
means a lot of appointments,

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.220
a resurgence for that
particular party.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.800
And so the Republicans were
gathering around the country

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.140
for their Lincoln Day dinners.

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:51.460
Lincoln of course being a person of
central importance to Republicans

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:54.890
when Lincoln's birthday comes
around from small courthouses

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:57.980
in the Midwest to Washington DC
there are Lincoln Day gatherings

00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.280
like this.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.950
And this one was held in the
old Uline not auditorium,

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:08.210
but you know a building
the one that is long gone.

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:11.970
And they'd invited three
choirs to come and perform.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:15.390
Two were from white private
universities in the south

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:19.570
and the third choir was a
choir from Howard University.

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:23.180
The choir from Howard University's
bus was banned and blocked

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.900
from entering into the facility.

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.230
Now I was born in Washington
and anyone

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:31.740
who knew Washington back then
would've understood exactly why it

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:33.040
was the case.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.520
The only group of black kids
approaching the building somehow

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.990
couldn't get in.

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:39.240
So Ethel Payne was
furious about this.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.800
She was also furious about the fact

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.780
that they had a black face
performance during this ceremony

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.500
and she had already written
to the Republicans about this.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:50.330
But now she wanted to come to one
of Eisenhower's press conferences

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:51.700
to take it up with the man himself.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.000
He had been the speaker,
he's the head

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.670
of the Republican Party what does
he have to say about what went

00:11:56.670 --> 00:12:00.060
on over the weekend at
the Lincoln Day event.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:04.040
And how did she get to do
that, how did she get to be

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.450
in the White House press
corps to ask that question?

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:09.000
Well Ethel Payne was then
the Washington correspondent

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.290
for the Chicago Defender,
the most widely circulated

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:15.580
and significantly important
African-American newspaper

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:16.880
at the time.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:20.820
Now often when I give these
talks or interview people talk

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.180
about whether I discovered
Ethel Payne.

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:24.540
And it's an uncomfortable moment

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.510
because Ethel Payne didn't
need any discovering.

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:30.750
The truth of the matter is that
our segregation from that period

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:33.460 position:56%
in a sense continues in our history.

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:38.140 position:56%
That just like many African-American
institutions the black press

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:41.820
operated in complete
invisibility to white America.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:45.280
But it's a story press it
goes all the way back to 1827

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.490
with the Freedom Journal of
the Baltimore Afro-American.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:51.820
Many of these papers that, you
know, valiantly crusaded not only

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:56.200 position:56%
to end slavery, but to work
against Jim Crow to end segregation.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.940
And Ethel Payne had a particularly
lovely connection to the paper

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:02.300
because her dad was
a Pullman porter.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:05.150
You're seeing a photograph
of Pullman porters.

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:07.440
Well Pullman porters
played an interesting role

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.840 position:56%
in the life of the Chicago Defender.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.570
If you're unfamiliar with the
Chicago Defender do not think of it

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:16.610
as merely a Chicago newspaper
any more than we might think

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:19.920
of the New York Times as
merely a New York paper.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:24.240 position:56%
Chicago Defender was circulated
nationally after it started in 1905,

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.240
but to get the Chicago Defender

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.590
in some southern counties
was not only illegal

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:31.640
where there were actually
laws against reading

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.400
and circulating the
Chicago Defender.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.510
But more seriously it could
involve the loss of life.

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:39.300
You did not want to be seen as
an African-American in the south

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.470
with a copy of the Chicago Defender
sticking out your back pocket.

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:46.220
So you were not going to
subscribe to it by mail.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:51.030
Yet Pullman porters who traveled
the nation would then take bundles,

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:54.430
Chicago being the nerve center of
the rail system, would take bundles

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:57.690
of the paper south with
them and leave them in towns

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:00.230
and they would be set
up in the barbershops

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:02.040
of the towns as a weekly then.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.490
So when the men came in to
have their Saturday shave

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:06.460 position:56%
or haircut they could pick up a copy

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:08.000
of the Defender and
take it back home.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
And it was read by at least six or
seven different people after that.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.620
Well Ethel Payne's dad
was a Pullman porter.

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.790
Now I don't know if he
carried the papers too,

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:19.840
but I've often loved
that connection.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.730
But being a Pullman porter also
offered certain advantages.

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:25.440
She and her dad and her
mom settled in a part

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.700
of Southside Chicago
called West Englewood.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.710
West Englewood is different than
the rest of Southside Chicago.

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:33.980
Here's a picture of
Ethel at her birth.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:39.210
And here's a picture of their
house and those people who are

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:42.530
from Chicago in this audience now
I'm petrified because there's an H

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:45.850
in the name of her street, but
it's pronounced Troop Street.

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:49.990
What was significant is that
he could afford to buy a house.

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:53.390
Very few African Americans
could buy houses at that point.

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:57.610
Those Pullman porter jobs and post
office jobs were the best to have.

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:01.420
But more significantly than owning
the house West Englewood was a very

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:05.150
different community
in Southside Chicago.

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:09.610
Payne described it as being an
island in a sea of whiteness,

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:12.390
meaning that all the
neighborhoods on all four sides

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:14.110
of West Englewood were white.

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:17.710
The significance of that because
segregation Chicago was done

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:21.370
through economic means, through
social means, but not by law.

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:24.530
If you were in that school district
you could walk to the school,

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:27.040
so she was in white
school districts.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.970
Now isn't that white schools
were necessarily better

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:33.460
than black schools, although in
many cases that could be the case.

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:38.390 position:56%
But more significantly, she lived
next door to Lynn Bloom High School.

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:41.310
Lynn Bloom High School
was the jewel in the crown

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:43.770
of the white school
system in Chicago.

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:47.000 position:56%
So it wasn't she was just going to
a white school she was getting to go

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.850
to the best high school in Chicago.

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:53.200
And early on when I was doing
this research somebody had told me

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.470
that Ethel Payne had had
Ernest Hemingway's teacher

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:59.520
as an English teacher at
Lynn Bloom High School.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:03.110
Now I'm trained as a journalist
and my editor always said to me,

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:06.240
if your mother says she
loves you check it out.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:12.120 position:56%
So I operate from a position of, you
know, critical thinking or cynicism.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:15.410
Well, it turns out that
in fact was the case.

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:18.260
But what was more significant
for me wasn't

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.630
that I had now a great anecdote
is how did she get to be there.

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:24.810
Why had she left Oak Park to
come and teach at Lynn Bloom?

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:28.350
Because when Lynn Bloom was opened
right after the Chicago riots

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:32.460
in 1919 it was simply
the best school to be in.

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:36.020
So any teacher her
caliber which gladly move.

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:37.320
And I use that because I want you

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.720
to understand how significant
getting to go to Lynn Bloom was.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.020
It's a school that takes

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:44.960
up an entire block it
looks like a college.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.500
Not only was it built in
such an important fashion,

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.830
but it attracted the best teachers.

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:51.900
Now a little moment of
social justice here.

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.520
When Ethel Payne went to
Lynn Bloom she was allowed

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.670
to write some articles
for the school paper,

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:58.990
at least one that I know
of, maybe some more.

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:02.410
But she made it clear that just
even the thought of asking to be

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:03.980
on the staff of this school

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:08.230
which was 99.9% white
was out of the question.

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:10.860
So her journalistic achievements
there were never recognized.

00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:14.830
Well I was invited to come
to Lynn Bloom and speak

00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:18.160
and the journalism room has now
been renamed the Ethel Payne

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.030
Journalism Center.

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:23.470
And I love the idea of succeeding
generations of kids coming

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:25.090
in with their smart
phones and saying,

00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:28.720
who's this Payne fellow assuming
it's a guy looking her up

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.380
and discovering who she
is and thus being inspired

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:34.660
to perhaps do the same kind
of journey that she did.

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.580
That's her graduating
from high school.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:39.140
When she graduated from
high school she went

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.390
on to get some various
forms of education.

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:43.190 position:56%
She went to Crane Community College,

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:45.360
which is now Malcolm
X Community College.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.100
She went to Garrett, which was --

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:51.070
it actually had a long name then
it was called the Mission School

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:54.240
for Social Training and
something else and rather.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.530
It was a religiously-based free
college that was opened to blacks

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:01.590 position:56%
and whites to basically teach you to
be a social worker or a missionary.

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:05.580
She used that training to work in
a corrections facility for a while,

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.480
but she couldn't get work.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.550
She couldn't get the
work that she wanted.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:14.450 position:56%
She did publish in Abbott's Monthly
which was the premier black magazine

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:18.020
of the time in which Richard Wright
published his first short story

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.400
at the same time Ethel Payne
was publishing her friction,

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.290
a remarkable achievement.

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:25.300
But to get a professional
job, particularly one

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:27.810
that involved writing
in Chicago was as rare

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:30.500
as a warm day in winter
in that city.

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:33.090
Seven out of 10 African-American
women according

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:36.050
to a labor census I found
who had a job in Chicago

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:39.430
at that time worked
as domestic servants.

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:43.350
So Payne looked quite
far away for a job.

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:49.390
She had heard that they
needed service club employees

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:52.770
in occupied Japan in 1948.

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:55.960
Now if you remember it's like
USO there were these clubs all

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.160
around the world for troops.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.810
And you're going to say 1948.

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:04.440
Of course, Truman has desegregated
the military through his order.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:08.460
Well, there was this General
MacArthur in Japan who had a habit

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:11.600
of never listening to his
president, his commander-in-chief.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.340
As you know, that ends up one

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:15.070
of the reasons he didn't
get to keep his job.

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:19.450
So he had no intention of
disaggregating the troops.

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:21.900
And if I remember I'll tell
you a funny story I found

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.200
in your archives about it.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:27.700
But Ethel Payne got a job then as a
service club hostess to go to Japan

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:30.490
and leave Chicago and
work in a service club.

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:32.440
Now this is an extraordinary
journey,

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:35.620
I mean she's leaving
Southside Chicago to go halfway

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.460
around the world to
work with troops.

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:40.780
There's a photograph of her with
a group of young black troops

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:45.470
about to go into Tokyo and here
she is organizing a birthday party.

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:48.920
So many things happened to her
and the other soldiers there.

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.830
For many of them it was the
first time to live in a society

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:54.760
without the kinds of
segregations they had at home.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.780
One and I won't quote
it exactly right,

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:58.080
but it's in my book right here.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:02.940 position:56%
But one soldier wrote back and said,
you know, I'm not a Negro here.

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:06.830
Now the Japanese are xenophobic and
they're not wild about foreigners,

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:08.750
but they didn't have
the kind of racism

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:10.870
that the southern troop
leaders certainly did.

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:13.180 position:56%
So as soon as they left the confines

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:17.330 position:56%
of their base they experienced a
kind of life that was very different

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:19.340
and it changed a lot
of their viewpoint

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:20.970
of the United States
when they came back.

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:24.070
But one of the things Ethel Payne
observed while she was there

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:28.700
in the destitute days of Japan's
occupancy was that a lot --

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:33.120
there were a lot of single Japanese
women either widows or young women.

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:37.300
And remember it's a very destitute
country who were quite eager

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:40.920
to enjoy the economic might
that the young American white

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.090
and black soldiers had.

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:46.350
And so they dated quite
freely the American troops.

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:49.870
Well black soldiers also
dated Japanese women.

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:55.080
This created a whole new
problem because it created

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.360
like as you know the
result of dating often

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.660
in those periods were children.

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:01.340
And these mixed-race orphans,

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:03.850
I mean these mixed-race
children became orphans

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:06.160
because the Japanese
women rejected them

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.610
because they were partially
African-American,

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:12.830
sometimes actually engaged in
infanticide or just abandoned them

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:14.990
and they ended up in an orphanage.

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:18.440
From the point of view of the
military this was another horror

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:21.210
because remember most of
the military command come

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:24.910
from southern states where the
idea of any form of communication

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:28.280
between an African-American
and a woman outside

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:32.590
of the African-American
race was a crime.

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:37.050
And so they viewed Japanese women
almost in the sense as being white

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:38.370
and having this relationship.

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:41.830
So these poor children were
completely abandoned and ignored.

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:44.790
And Ethel Payne took a
great interest in writing

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:46.560
about them and learning about them.

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.590
She'd taken an interest
in everything in Japan,

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:50.330
but she had no place to publish it.

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:51.630
So in a sense I like to think

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:53.990
that her diary became
her place of publication.

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:57.360
She went to see the war
tribunals, she wrote about it.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:00.660
She went to learn about these
poor orphans and wrote about it.

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:05.330
Well the Korean War broke out
and the only way you could get

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:07.720
to the Korean War as a reporter
was to come through Japan,

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.330
that's where the central
headquarters were.

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:11.320
So Alex Wilson of the
Chicago Defender,

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:15.120
James Hicks from the Baltimore
Afro-American came to write.

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:18.420
Because remember the troops
are segregated so their conduct

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:20.690
in the war is a big story
for black newspapers

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:22.490
in the United states
virtually ignored

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:24.440
by the white papers in the states.

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:27.110
And they were facing
some unusual problems

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:30.050
since the black troops
couldn't be relieved

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:34.080
by white soldiers they
weren't getting relieved

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.860 position:56%
at the same rate on the front lines.

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:39.240
And if you remember your history of
the Korean War it's not going well

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.760
for the first few months.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:44.300
And so and let's not forget
these are kids essentially 18

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:48.570
19-year-olds, kids facing the
barrels of North Korean rifles.

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:50.580
So a lot of them fled
the front lines.

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:53.250
They were, I shouldn't say
lines, but a fair number.

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:55.730
And they were immediately
court-martialed with a potential

00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:58.100 position:56%
of being executed for their actions.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:02.300
Thurgood Marshall came
to defend them,

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:04.570
he was then a young
lawyer with the NAACP.

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:06.970
It took him two tries
to win permission

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:08.900
from General MacArthur to come.

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:11.970
And here's the little story,
it's in an endnote inside my book

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:14.080 position:56%
if you want to get it completely
right because I'll probably screw it

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:17.140
up a little bit, but I found it
downstairs in the manuscript room.

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:20.400
He's having a conversation with
MacArthur outside of his building

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:24.660
and it's one of these typical
black-and-white power discussions

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:30.240
of that time where Marshall
says something like, you know,

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:33.670
there's this black soldier who's
killed more people as a sniper

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:36.550
than any white soldier now
why he can't he be doing this.

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:39.390
And there's a soldier who
has this, you know going

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:40.990
through the whole list
and McArthur kept saying,

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:42.470
no I can't find anyone
that's good enough.

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:44.790
What about this and no, I can't
find anyone that's good enough.

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:48.280
And the band comes out, it's
all white and McArthur says,

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:51.010
God I just love the
music of that band.

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:53.410
And I wish I had it in front of you
because I won't get it quite right.

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:55.650
Marshall turns to him and says,
now you're not going to say

00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:57.820
to me Mr. General that
you couldn't find a Negro

00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:00.970
who could blow a horn
as well as these guys.

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:03.810
I couldn't get it in the
book, but my editor allowed me

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:06.090
to sneak it into the end notes.

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:09.120
So Ethel Payne this is
her upon return to Chicago

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:12.570
at one point wearing
her Japanese clothes.

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:16.530
She meets with Alec Wilson and
James Hicks, these reporters

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:20.710 position:56%
at the press club in Japan and
tells them about this fraternization

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:25.390
between the soldiers and these poor
orphans that have been stranded.

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:28.500
And Alex Wilson says,
can I borrow your diary

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:31.720
and as a result the Chicago
Defender publishes the first

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.840 position:56%
of two byline pieces by Ethel Payne.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:37.860
It says, Japan girls playing
GIs for sucker says fate

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:41.730
that awaits war babies is
tragedy of yank Oriental unions.

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:45.400
Jet Magazine gets into it with
a photograph of these poor kids

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:47.860
who are being taunted by other kids

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:51.350
and being called half-breed
Americans.

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:54.070
Well the story was a
sensation back home.

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:57.950
Her sister placed a cross
specific call to her saying,

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:01.150
do you realize you're on the
front page of the Defender.

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:02.860
It also got her into
a lot of trouble

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:04.780
because as you can
imagine the central command

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:07.570
in Japan was not happy
with this kind of coverage.

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:11.270
So they yanked her from her job,
they put her a dead-end desk job

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:13.180
and MacArthur before he left Japan

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:15.590
after defending their soldiers
got her out of trouble.

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:20.290
Well the Defender true to its
word having got her deeply

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:23.830
into trouble offered her a job
and she headed back to Chicago

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:25.440
to work for the Defender.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:29.060 position:56%
Now let's not think that the
Defender is being merely charitable.

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:32.660
Louis Martin, the editor,
and others there clearly knew

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:34.550
that Ethel Payne was a journalist.

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:39.000
She had a keen eye for stories
what she didn't have was training.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.750
She'd taken a couple courses
on writing at [inaudible],

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:44.190
but she was not trained
as a journalist.

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:47.500
And I was on a radio show one
day and the host said something.

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.360
I wish he had told me this
before I had written the book

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.700
because I would have put it in it.

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:53.650
He said that reading her
struck him that she was much

00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:56.700
like a jazz artist,
learning in the band

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:59.300
and in the playing,
but not in the schools.

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:03.180
So she came back to Chicago,
worked for the Chicago Defender.

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:07.060 position:56%
Here's a picture of her with Adlai
Stevenson, the governor of Illinois,

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:10.290
two times candidate for
President of the United States.

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:12.810
I assume you all know
quip about why he lost.

00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:16.730
Somebody said to him once you're
the thinking man's candidate

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:18.030
for president.

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:21.090
He said yes that was the problem.

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:24.100
And she's really doing well,

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:26.440
she's writing terrific
coverage in Chicago.

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.330
She attracts the attention
of other papers.

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:32.080
One paper offers her part
ownership of the paper

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.820
if she would come to work for them.

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:35.810
She gets ready to go
and Louis Martin says,

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:41.470
unless they offered her 49%,
unless you offered 51% don't go.

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:43.880
And instead he says, why
don't you go to Washington.

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:47.390 position:56%
She comes to Washington, you can see
her there interviewing Roy Wilkins.

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:50.100
The man to the right
with the cigar is,

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:54.290
my mind's gone it'll take a second.

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:56.850
Gosh, this is really embarrassing.

00:26:56.850 --> 00:26:59.430
He's the first African-American
correspondent

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:02.070
in the White House
press corps and in

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:05.950 position:56%
about three seconds he'll come back,
so please excuse my senior moment.

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:10.400
He's Republican and he's quite
nervous about what Ethel Payne

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.400
and Alice Dunnigan,
the two black women

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:13.700
in the press corps are going to do.

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.570
And I'll tell you a little
more about that later.

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:18.090
So anyways, so let's
get back to that moment.

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:22.560
Here we are in February of 1954,
Ethel Payne is really furious

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:26.990
so she says to the president,
Mr. President, what's happened

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:31.640
with this business of the Howard
University choir not being able

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:32.940
to get in.

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:34.740
Now you don't become president
without being somewhat smart.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:37.980
So Eisenhower says, well
if they were in fact barred

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:41.570
because of race I apologize all
I'll have my people look into it.

00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:42.870
So he got out of that one.

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:47.190 position:56%
But what Ethel Payne noticed is that
the next day the Washington Post,

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:51.720
the local paper which prides itself
on covering news of the locality,

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:55.480
had failed to cover that
story now wrote about it

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.800
because it had been mentioned at
a presidential press conference.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.800
In other words, bringing up topics

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.150
at the presidential
press conference,

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:05.330
which had 197 white
reporters, 3 black reporters.

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:07.810
If you brought up topics of
interest and civil rights

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:12.090
or race matters it forced the other
reporters to have to cover it.

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:14.800
Now it wasn't necessarily that
these reporters were racist

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.690
as Ethel Payne would simply say,
some were but most of them weren't,

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:21.350
it just wasn't part of
their daily experience.

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:23.440
When Ethel Payne got up
to get to the White House,

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.260
getting to the White
House was a challenge.

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:29.000
Finding a bathroom she could use in
Washington in 1954 was a challenge.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.780 position:56%
Finding a place to eat was a
challenge not for the white reports.

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:36.140
In a sense she felt that she was
part of the problem every day.

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:40.080
She used the word problem, that's
a 1950's word for that issue.

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:44.780
So she in a sense dropped
this notion of being objective

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:47.330
and instead decided to be fair.

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:52.250
But working with Louis
Martin, the Washington lobbyist

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:54.860
for the NAACP nicknamed
the 101st senator

00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:56.610
because of his effectiveness.

00:28:56.610 --> 00:29:00.890
Every few weeks they would work
on crafting really good questions

00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:04.620 position:56%
and the questions weren't simply to
elicit from the president a response

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:08.240 position:56%
on an important policy stance
regarding civil rights whether it be

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:11.840
housing, busing or
federal money or jobs.

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:14.790
But also to educate the
president and the press corps

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:16.550
because they didn't
know about these issues.

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:21.720
So when she would ask a question
sometimes the questions were really

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:25.730
long out of necessity because
the guy up front didn't,

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:27.730
I mean you know today you
get a [inaudible] together

00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:30.490
and they immediately start talking
shop because they know everything.

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:32.530
Section eight housing,
all these terminologies,

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:33.920
what are you doing
about the other thing.

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:36.060
But Eisenhower knew nothing
about these civil rights issues

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:37.360
and nor did the press corps.

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:40.280
So she continued to ask
these questions until one day

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:45.720
in 1955 she said to him,
Mr. President you know

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:48.260
under the commerce clause
of the constitution,

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:51.240
again I'm paraphrasing you'll
find the exact words in the book,

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:54.130
congress could desegregate
interstate bus travel.

00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:56.420
Are you in favor of doing
something like that,

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:58.330
we really need your support?

00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:03.000
Well he rears up in his sort of
military posture and he says,

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.190
I don't know where you get
off asking that question.

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:09.360
And you're thinking oh James
he's just getting excited

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.350
up here having a chance
to talk to people

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:15.110
and I'm exaggerating the
you could do what I did.

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:17.250
But there's an even better
option I drove to Abilene,

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:19.140
Kansas to hear the audio tape

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:23.020
and you can hear his anger,
the timbre of his voice.

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:25.400
He is clearly ticked
off at the effrontery

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.090
of her to ask this question.

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:28.900
Now if you want you
can just go to NPR

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:32.020
because Karen Grigsby
Bates has the audio tape

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:33.320
on a story about Ethel Payne.

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:36.940
You can hear him going where do
you get off asking this question.

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:40.990 position:56%
And then he goes on to say, you
know, I'm president of all Americans

00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:42.930
and I want to do what's in the best

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:47.260
of all Americans not any just
little special interest group.

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:49.020
The room went dead quiet.

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:52.820
Eisenhower had said on the record
before the nation that the quest

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:55.800
for equality by a large group
of Americans was tantamount

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.800
to a special interest lobby
like let's say the farm lobby.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:02.550
A reporter quickly says, Mr.
President let's talk about Hawaii,

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:04.270
you know, really uncomfortable.

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:06.060
The next day of course,
there were headlines

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:09.000
across the country a
reporter irks Ike, you know,

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.180
the old days when they had
that wonderful literation.

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:16.670
And so Eisenhower learned
his lesson that day

00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:20.150
and the lesson was you don't
call on Ethel Payne anymore.

00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:21.970
So she was basically frozen out.

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:24.690
Alice Dunnigan had the same
treatment over time too,

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:26.730
her questions ceased to be asked.

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:29.230
And we might not have heard much
more about Ethel Payne except

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:33.240
for this woman who then as we
might have[inaudible] said,

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.240
sat in the wrong part of the bus

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:39.110
and triggered the Montgomery
bus boycott at the same time.

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:42.360
So Ethel Payne left Washington
and went to the front lines

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:46.630
of the civil rights movement
in Montgomery and in Alabama,

00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:49.890
much to the consternation of her
paper who were quite unwilling

00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:52.310
to send her south until
this had happened.

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:53.610
Why was that?

00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:54.910
Well let's think this through.

00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:58.600
She's black and she's female,
the two most expendable forms

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:01.620
of life among white
segregationists in the south.

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:06.270
But she carries something even more
fearful to them a reporter's pad.

00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:08.970
She was going to go south
and report to northern folks,

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:11.530
particularly Afro-Americans
what was going on.

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:13.670
So she arrives in Montgomery

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:16.540
where these two men are
basically introducing themselves

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:21.870 position:56%
to the nation, Martin Luther King,
Ralph Abernathy you see in the back.

00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:26.530
And she's just landed in
Montgomery and she does something

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:30.060
that I think is incredible, I mean
having studied journalism history,

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:33.280 position:56%
incredibly important and overlooked.

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:36.940
Which is now as a white guy writing
civil rights history 60 years later

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:39.740
I can tell you the turning
moments, the turning points.

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:42.150
But no one knew how
significant Montgomery was

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:44.540
at that moment the
boycott had just begun.

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:48.870
And more importantly, no one knew
yet about the extraordinary shift

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:51.360
in the leadership of the
civil rights movement.

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.650
Prior to that moment if you go back
to the 19th century you had people

00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:57.830
like Frederick Douglass or then
labor leaders like W. D. Boyce,

00:32:57.830 --> 00:33:00.480
you had the movement into
the legal arena with people

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:03.490
like Thurgood Marshall,
the NAACP or the March

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:06.090
on Washington movement
led by A. Philip Randolph.

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:09.040
By the way, for whom she worked
with on the original March

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:13.780
on Washington before she became
a reporter in 1940 and 41.

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:18.030
But now it was shifting to the
clergy and it was the birth

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:19.890
of the nonviolent movement.

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:22.530
And so she writes this sentence
her first week in Montgomery

00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:25.140
and she says, this
new gladiator goes

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:29.170
into battle wearing a reverse
collar and holding a Bible.

00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:32.170
This new Moses is the
Negro preacher.

00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:33.800 position:56%
Now two things to notice about that.

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:37.330
She's the first to perceive this
from the ground floor as opposed

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:39.910
to the luxury of a
history book years later.

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:42.240
But notice her language
and this is one

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:45.790
of the reasons why Ethel Payne
is not necessarily remembered.

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:48.500
We look at history
anachronistically,

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.410
we look at it from the
viewpoint of today.

00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:54.350
So when the Library of America
assembled its two volumes,

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:57.360
a collection of civil
rights reporting,

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.520
Ethel Payne's not in
that collection.

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:02.240
And why is that, because
historians looking back today,

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:03.700
primarily white historians,

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:07.290 position:56%
are looking for these great analytic
pieces written at enormous length

00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:10.040
with convoluted sentences and
analysis that might have appeared

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:12.340
in say the New York Times.

00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:16.830 position:56%
They dismissed Ethel Payne because
they forget who she was writing for.

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:20.210
She was writing for an audience
that when the paper started 50%

00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:22.670
of its potential readership
could not read.

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:26.920
By the 1950's African-American
literacy rates had risen,

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:30.010
but nonetheless she was going to
write for her audience no different

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:33.670
than Jimmy Breslin in the Post
or Ernie Pyle in World War 2,

00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:34.970
you write for your audience.

00:34:34.970 --> 00:34:37.710
So she makes these
religious allusions coming

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:40.220
out of St. John's AME
Church and she writes

00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:43.110 position:56%
in a particular style and it worked.

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:45.970
She became this conduit
between the front lines

00:34:45.970 --> 00:34:48.590
of the civil rights movement
and black readership all

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:52.610
around the United States serving
to activate, as well as to inform.

00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:53.910
Because one of the things

00:34:53.910 --> 00:34:58.200
about journalism is merely
reporting can trigger activation.

00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:59.630
Think about it, one
of the great powers

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:02.880
of reporting is illuminating
the dark recesses in society,

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:05.570
telling people about poverty,
telling people about things

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:07.610
and that often triggers things.

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:09.310
So there she was doing this,

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:12.740
but I want to tell you another
anecdote that I just love.

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:15.060
White reporters began to
show up in Montgomery,

00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:16.960
it was a big story right.

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:20.680 position:56%
So they go to these church
meetings and when Martin Luther King

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:23.940
or Ralph Abernathy are up on the
podium do you think they would say

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:27.410
to the audience who knows
them hi I'm Ralph Abernathy,

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:28.790
they started talking.

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:30.510
But who didn't know who they were,

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:32.740
the white reporters lining
the side of the wall.

00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:34.040
They would lean and say,

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.500
Abe Abernathy how do you
spell that guy's name.

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:37.800
And so the black reporters

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.900
and the white reporters formed
an alliance in Montgomery.

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:42.590
Black reporters couldn't
talk to sheriffs,

00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:45.240
they wouldn't give them the time
of day the white reporters could.

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:46.880
But the black reporters
who were embedded

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.320
in the black community could
tell the white reporters what was

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:50.620
going on.

00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:53.090
So every day at Morton Dean's
Drugstore, I think that's the name

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:55.490
of it, no it was Dean's
Drugstore not Morton.

00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:57.900
They would meet and
exchange information.

00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:59.290
So here's the little secret bit

00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:01.690
of civil rights reporting
history I love.

00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:04.480
When white liberals in the north
opened up the Washington Post

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:08.080
and New York Times, the Boston
Globe they were reading coverage

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:12.060
that was being shaped by
the Negro press of the time,

00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:14.120
the press they didn't
even know existed.

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:17.510
So even their own coverage was
being shaped by the black press.

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:20.670
Ethel Payne then did
something quite remarkable.

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:22.830
She decided that the
black freedom struggle

00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:26.200
in the United States was not merely
a domestic struggle it was tied

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:29.160
intimately to an international
struggle for freedom.

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.030
If you have a map of Africa

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:35.880
in 1950 all you see are colonies no
black rulers, the same with Asia.

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:39.980
So there was this remarkable
gathering going on in Bandung,

00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:44.140
Indonesia where folks from all
around the world were coming

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:47.070 position:56%
to meet together in an international
summit and they were doing

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:50.970
so without permission and
without inviting the two countries

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:55.140
that were carving up the world,
the United States and the USSR.

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:57.690
This was not something
the US was happy about.

00:36:57.690 --> 00:36:59.970
Here's a headline by the way
that gives you a sense of it,

00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:06.030
Afro Asia meet first confab
of world's darker people.

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:08.640
Adam Clayton Powell said
I'm coming, hang on.

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:10.510
The State Department
said, no you're not.

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:12.740
He looked at them and said I'm
an elected member of the House

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:14.500
of Representatives you don't
tell me where I can go.

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:17.380
So then they tried tactic number
two, we'll give you a plane

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:21.040
and a tour of Africa and you can
come back a hero, no thank you.

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.340
So he went.

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:24.410
Richard Wright abandoned
everything in Paris

00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:26.310
where he was writing a
book and hopped on a plane.

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:29.670
Everybody who's anybody, including
this wonderful moment in the book

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:33.310
with Chet Huntley, do you remember
him, the Huntly and Brinkley?

00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:36.630
Just before he became a TV
anchor he was out there.

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:40.240
And Ethel Payne sent back
her exclusive photographs.

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:42.080
And a lot of history

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:46.050 position:56%
of international relations dismissed
the significance of this conference

00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:48.670
because it didn't necessarily
produce anything.

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:50.270
Well it did produce something,

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:53.530
it was the first time all the
future leaders who were going

00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:55.840
to liberate their countries
were coming together,

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:59.770
again without permission, without
approbation, without being part

00:37:59.770 --> 00:38:02.190
of the two countries
carving up the world.

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:06.240
So the focus began for her
to look elsewhere and outside

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:08.320
of the United States, as
well as to connect things.

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:12.420
So in 1957, Ghana became the
first sub-Saharan country

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:15.440
to become liberated
from colonial rule.

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:18.840
I should exclude South
Africa and Rhodesia

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:21.520
and have a black government
take power.

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:25.590
And so Eisenhower sent Richard
Nixon off to his vice president

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:27.900
to represent the United
States at the gathering.

00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:33.230
Now this is quite a feat because in
those days Air Force One if we were

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:36.450
to call the plane that,
getting there is not so easy.

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:39.010
In fact, one of the planes that
went had to stop in Morocco

00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:40.730
and basically have
its engine replaced.

00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:43.050
So just getting was quite a feat.

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:46.160
Everybody who was anybody in the
civil rights movement showed up,

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.800
including Martin Luther King.

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:51.250
This photograph is anachronistic,
it's actually not taken in Ghana,

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:53.740
but it's the only one I could
find of the two getting together.

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:56.570
So here's the delicious moment
that Ethel Payne witnesses,

00:38:56.570 --> 00:39:00.080 position:56%
the first time the Martin Luther
King gets to meet the vice president

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:01.950
of the United States,
not in the United States

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:04.510
but all the way over in Africa.

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:06.160
So King says to him, you
know, it's really neat

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:08.440
to see you here celebrating
black freedom.

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:11.260
If you really want to see the black
freedom struggle Mr. Vice President

00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:16.220
might you want to come south
and visit us in Alabama,

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:17.760
Nixon [inaudible] do that?

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:20.160
But why don't you come to
Washington and have a meeting

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.370
with me, which is a big deal.

00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:26.880
So Martin Luther King does come
to Washington subsequently,

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:29.520
meets with Nixon and then
meets with Eisenhower,

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:33.180
it's the first high level
meetings that occurs.

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:36.360
Now what was also going
on in 1957 is the debate

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:38.110
over the 57 Civil Rights Act.

00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:41.320
And the photograph you see up there
you've got Kennedy on the left,

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:44.930
Hubert Humphrey in the
middle and LBJ on the right.

00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:46.260
You ask any young member

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:49.020
of our society who's had a
history high school textbook

00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:51.620
and they would immediately
say, oh of course, Kennedy,

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:54.680
Johnson great heroes of the civil
rights movement, they're the ones

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:57.040
who kind of got it through right.

00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:01.540
Well, that might be somewhat true
for 64 and the legacy of Kennedy

00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:03.880
and of course he's dead, but
people voting for the bill.

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:09.070 position:56%
But in this moment those two people
are gutting the 57 Civil Rights Act,

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:11.110
they're taking all of
the good parts out of it.

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:13.950
And the one person who
is there bugging them

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:15.250
when it comes off the floor

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:17.770
and asking these questions
is Ethel Payne,

00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:21.250
challenging LBJ, challenging
Kennedy.

00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:24.910
Now sit tight because you may
fall off your seat when I suggest

00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:28.370
that the hero of the moment
is none other than this man.

00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:31.640
The man who brought us Watergate
and Vietnam, brought us the law

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.670
and order campaign, which
was certainly a subterfuge to

00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:36.810
and please don't feel offended, but
this is the way I think [inaudible]

00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:38.790
to put blacks back in their place.

00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:42.830
You know by calling it law
and order in the 68 campaign.

00:40:42.830 --> 00:40:44.640
He's on the good side
at this moment,

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.750
he wants that bill
passed much more in time.

00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:49.560
Now why might that be,
he could be a nice guy.

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:53.240
But he could also be a Republican
who's thinking back 25 years

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:56.150
because black voters in the
United States had only been voting

00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:57.550
for Democrats since 32.

00:40:57.550 --> 00:41:00.180
In 57, that's 25 that's
one generation.

00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:01.920
So he and a number

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:06.040
of African-American Republicans
thought we could lure them back

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:09.050
by supporting the 57
Civil Rights Act.

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:11.940
It does get passed, it's a
completely gutted and decimated

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:14.150
and useless piece of legislation.

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:20.150
So what happens after that is
that Ethel Payne is meeting

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:25.440
with Simeon Booker from Jet
Magazine and he had gone

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.060
to Ghana with them on the trip.

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:29.620
Remember I told you it's a
really big ordeal for reporters

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:30.930
to go all the way to Africa.

00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:34.270
So because these jet trips didn't
occur very often they said let's

00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:37.020
have a reunion of everybody,
let's meet at my new apartment

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:38.690
and get everybody together.

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:40.600
And Simeon says, yeah that's
great why don't you invite the

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:41.900
vice president.

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:44.630
[Inaudible] a funny
idea, so she invites him

00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:46.510
and he says yes and comes.

00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:51.360
So Pat Nixon and Richard Nixon show
up at her apartment for the party

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:55.210 position:56%
and they just don't show up and wave
they stay for the whole evening.

00:41:55.210 --> 00:41:58.360
You don't think that's a big deal,
here's what Jet Magazine says.

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:01.730
Marking first time a vice
president, just look at the words

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:07.070
from the 1950's, has socialized at
the home of a Negro in Washington.

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:10.510
And there's another picture
of her and the gather.

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:15.110
So at that moment Richard Nixon
in a sense was a good guy,

00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:19.910
but after his election she also
realizes that JFK has changed

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:21.550
and he becomes a good guy.

00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:26.590
And subsequent to his death she
becomes an enormous admirer of LBJ.

00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:30.380
She leaves the Defender for a while
after a fight with her editors

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:32.170
and she's working in
voter registration

00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:34.760
with the Democratic Party
that picture you see.

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:37.100
By the way, if you look at
the device in front of LBJ,

00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:40.180
that's what they then
called a teleprompter.

00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:42.280
He was the first to
use such a device.

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:47.100
And in 1964, famously when
they gather for the signing

00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:50.650
of the 64 Civil Rights Act that
did have much more in the way

00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:53.370
of teeth the woman who
is asked among the people

00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:56.170
to be there is Ethel Payne and
there she is receiving a pen.

00:42:56.170 --> 00:42:59.550
She also receives a pen from
the 65 Civil Rights Act.

00:42:59.550 --> 00:43:02.280
What's significant about her
reporting and what I want you

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:05.860
to take away from today is an
understanding that particularly

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:07.810
in what's been happening
in the last two years.

00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:10.660
The events that we have seen
in Ferguson and other places,

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:13.200
we learn most of it
through the media.

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:15.570
Well there isn't a the media.

00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:18.480
The legacy of segregation
from that point still endures

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:19.780
in the media today.

00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:22.340
Yes, the Washington Post
has a more colorful staff,

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:26.310 position:56%
New York Times has minorities of all
sorts, but they're still primarily

00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:28.880
in a sense white institutions.

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:32.230
And why that's so significant is
if you have the honor as I did

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:36.430
to read the black press in the 50's
and 60's and read the white press

00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:39.640
at that time you learn
something to me as a white guy

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:41.910
that was fundamentally shocking.

00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:44.750
Which was that the New York Times,
the white papers that I grew

00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:49.020
up with you, viewed the 64 Civil
Rights Act, 65 Voting Rights Act

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:54.170
as munificent gifts being given
to disenfranchised people.

00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:56.250
If you read the Defender,
the Afro-American,

00:43:56.250 --> 00:43:59.220
you read Ethel Payne what you're
seeing is these are victories,

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:01.770
hard-fought victories
by everyday people

00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:05.400
like portrayed the movie Selma
winning it, wrestling it,

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:09.040 position:56%
taking it away from the government
who has refused to give those to us.

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:13.390
And that legacy still endures today
because if you look at the tone

00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:17.080
and look at the way we cover things
there's I think a high distrust

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:19.220
of the major white papers.

00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:23.560
Because if we go back a generation
it was a complete misunderstanding

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:25.010
of what was going on.

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:27.320
She didn't remain completely
out of journalism.

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:31.770
In 1967, Sengstacke at the
paper calls her up and says,

00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:34.320
we'd like you to come back and she
says, well under what conditions.

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:38.430
Well we'd like to send you to
Vietnam, so this is the headline.

00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:42.870
Chicago Defender to have its own
man in Vietnam, but she's a girl.

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:48.050
So Ethel Payne was sent to Vietnam
for three months, a long period,

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:51.040
and her job was to cover
the fate of black troops.

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:54.770
She was perfect for the job because
the Korean War had been segregated.

00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:57.050
This is the first desegregated war.

00:44:57.050 --> 00:45:01.050
She found instances of black
commanders sending white soldiers

00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:03.380
off, black and white
soldiers working together,

00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:06.490
black doctors in villages,
found all kinds

00:45:06.490 --> 00:45:08.600
of to her really remarkable things.

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:11.880
I mean, think about that war,
Colin Powell and others advanced

00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:14.920
because the military in a sense
was much more meritocracy.

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:19.970
She also found problems there, but
she did not focus on the war itself

00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:24.950 position:56%
and years later she regrets the fact
that she focused solely on the fate

00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:26.250
of African-American soldiers.

00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:29.690
And like so many other reporters
was manipulated by the White House

00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:32.000
and nobody was doing, I
don't know if you remember,

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.160
but no one was doing
the math back then.

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:38.220
At that point the body count we'd
wiped out North Vietnam, China,

00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:39.980
Korea and several other nations.

00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:42.900
And 67 is the turning
point when reporters begin

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:44.550
to question what's going on.

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:48.270
So she spent the rest of her
life traveling for the Defender.

00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:51.670
They brought her back to Chicago
and I like to say her favorite seat

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:53.740
when she was an editor at
the Chicago Defender was not

00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:56.740
in the newsroom, but
was in an airplane.

00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:59.710
She went to Africa with
this man, Henry Kissinger,

00:45:59.710 --> 00:46:01.070
on one of those whirlwind tours.

00:46:01.070 --> 00:46:03.500
She went with Secretary
of State Rogers.

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:06.690
I'm convinced that if there was a
thought bubble above Ethel Payne

00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:10.020
in this picture it is that
my mama said to be polite

00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:14.810
under all circumstances because she
was not fond of Henry Kissinger.

00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:17.670
She got on this trip for
instance, the Henry Kissinger trip

00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:20.320
because as they got
ready to go to Africa.

00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:23.580
This is the 1970's, we're not
talking about 60's and 50's,

00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:26.830
one of the people looking at the
press list said Mr. Secretary,

00:46:26.830 --> 00:46:30.090
you don't have anyone whose
African-American on this trip

00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:32.530
as a reporter and you're
going to Africa.

00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:34.280
So he said, oh call up that woman

00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:36.650
who always gives hell
about me on CBS.

00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:37.950
So they called up Ethel Payne,

00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:40.220
she scrambled to get her suitcase
together and she and a couple

00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:41.520
of other black reporters went.

00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:42.820
But this was always the case.

00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:47.440
There was also the case in
1973, when China was opened

00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:50.340
and the Chinese noticed
that the group of reporters

00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:54.850
who were being sent to come for
one of the early visits they said

00:46:54.850 --> 00:46:58.400
to the Americans politely, you
don't have any blacks on that list,

00:46:58.400 --> 00:46:59.990
don't you have blacks
in the United States.

00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:02.190
I mean you can imagine what
fun the red Chinese were,

00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:04.120
so Ethel Payne was invited to join.

00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:05.790
Here's a picture of
her on the streets

00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:08.410
of Shanghai wearing
her leopard skin,

00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:10.780
no leopard died it's
fake leopard skin.

00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:13.720
But and notice everybody's
looking at her.

00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:18.080
Remember how closed China was at
this point, so they had no idea

00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:21.860
if she was a ruler from
some African nation or what.

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:25.440
The other reporters noticed
what was going on in the street,

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:29.640
so they all got out of the
car as she walked by they all.

00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:35.120
When she got in the car she was
just crying tears of laughter.

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:38.240
Here's a picture of the group and
it's really interesting, you know,

00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:40.620
that photographs can tell a story.

00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:43.570
If you see there's another woman
in the group and she's looking off

00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:46.370
and the body language is sort
of like I'm really not part

00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:48.090
of this group, that's
the intellectual

00:47:48.090 --> 00:47:52.780
from New York Susan Sontag and in
a sense it really captured her.

00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:55.810
Ethel Payne continued to report
all over the place from the south,

00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:59.880
there she is with Shirley Chisholm,
there she is reading a Wire copy,

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:02.410
we have her with Jimmy
Carter early on.

00:48:02.410 --> 00:48:06.880
In 1984, at this point she's
a self-syndicated columnist,

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:10.670
so she's much freer to support
people on their campaigns.

00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:14.860
She was a strong supporter of
then Jesse Jackson who also lived

00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:18.460
in her house here in Washington.

00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:24.730
And in 1990, when Nelson Mandela
was freed she went at a very,

00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:28.460 position:56%
I mean in 1990 she'd be 78, 79 then,

00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:30.990
she went to South Africa
to interview him.

00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:34.230
And if you notice in the
photograph how he's dressed,

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:36.880
he'd come in overnight
from someplace

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:38.500
and he was dressed in his bathrobe.

00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:41.740
And this what I find so charming
about Ethel Payne's sense of humor

00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:43.820
and self-deprecating humor.

00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:45.120
She said lots of people got

00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:47.730
to interview Nelson Mandela
I'm the only one who did

00:48:47.730 --> 00:48:50.310
so while he was in his PJs.

00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:53.670
Before she passed away that's an
exhibit at the Anacostia Museum

00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:55.840
and you notice they're beginning
to call her the first lady

00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:57.630
of the black press repeatedly.

00:48:57.630 --> 00:49:00.730
She was uncomfortable with
that kind of iconic status,

00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:02.280
but she understood the power of it.

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:05.340
She placed a lot of women,
young women into jobs.

00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:07.370
She'd come and visit them
their first day on the job

00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:08.800
and say, now you be quality.

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:12.260
I've met these women who have
never forgotten what she did.

00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:15.470
Here she is at her
typewriter, she always stuck

00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:18.590
to it even though she had
been given a word processor.

00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:23.960
And after her death a postage
stamp was issued in her honor.

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:28.170
And to end I just want to tell
you two little thoughts about her

00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:31.710
that I think really represent.

00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:34.830
As a writer, I've always had the
rule that I like to end books

00:49:34.830 --> 00:49:36.950 position:56%
with my own words because, you know,

00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:40.140
frankly I put in all 400 pages
the last taste like the dessert

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:41.440 position:56%
if you come to my house you're going

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:43.470
to eat my dessert and
leave with my taste.

00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:46.790
But I kept finding that other
people had a much keener sense

00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:49.720 position:56%
than I could ever get of Ethel Payne
and one of them was James Joseph.

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:52.930
And here's what he
said at her funeral

00:49:52.930 --> 00:49:56.100
when it became his task
to speak about her.

00:49:56.100 --> 00:50:00.280
She used her skill not to
acquire power for herself.

00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:02.440
Think how different that is
in Washington these days.

00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:06.790
Not to acquire power for herself,
but to activate power in others

00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:08.480
at a time in which our world seemed

00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:11.560
to be fragmenting into
we and they groups.

00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:14.290
Ethel was searching for the
social blue of civil society,

00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:17.040
affirming the connectedness
of humanity.

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:20.070
She made the case in all
sectors of her society that fear

00:50:20.070 --> 00:50:23.270
of difference is the
fear of the future.

00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:28.660
In her own work she was not
simply reporting the news she was

00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:33.810 position:56%
stretching the horizon of the heart,
widening the circle of community,

00:50:33.810 --> 00:50:36.860
seeking to transform the
laissez-faire notion of live

00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:40.780
and let live into a moral
imperative of live and help live.

00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:46.710
In 1983, she was a professor
at Fisk University in Nashville

00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:49.810
and she was asked to give
a sermon at the AME Church

00:50:49.810 --> 00:50:52.170
and she probably felt very
comfortable there having grown

00:50:52.170 --> 00:50:54.460
up in an AME Church
across the street,

00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:57.610
although she by her own admission
was not a regular churchgoer later

00:50:57.610 --> 00:50:58.910
in life.

00:50:58.910 --> 00:51:01.650
And she said something there
that I translate a little bit.

00:51:01.650 --> 00:51:04.530
She said to the all-black
audience that day

00:51:04.530 --> 00:51:07.860
that ours was the generation
who put our lives on the line

00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:13.370
to send our kids to college, but
we forgot to tell them our story.

00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:17.160
And as a white historian I kind of
rework that sometimes and I say,

00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:19.510
we're all forgetting
to tell a story.

00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:22.300
The single most powerful
story of the United States

00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:24.600
around the world is
not our Declaration

00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:26.890
of Independence no matter
how lofty the ideals are,

00:51:26.890 --> 00:51:29.910
not our revolutionary war,
but the civil rights movement.

00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:32.740
If you leave the United States
that's what people ask you about.

00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:35.930
That's what inspires because
its grassroots changed

00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:37.230
from the bottom up.

00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:39.870
And so many people face
oppression around the world

00:51:39.870 --> 00:51:41.700
that a document signed by people

00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:46.330 position:56%
against England doesn't invoke the
same kind of inspiration than people

00:51:46.330 --> 00:51:48.210
who are portrayed in
a movie like Selma,

00:51:48.210 --> 00:51:50.160
just everyday people
getting together.

00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:52.730
And Ethel Payne was
part of that group,

00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:56.870
she's part of that second
rung of change makers.

00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:59.960
And I particularly want to bring
that message to younger people

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:02.240
because I taught high
school for 10 years

00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:05.520
and the version our next
generation are getting is

00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:08.070
that there was this awful
period of segregation,

00:52:08.070 --> 00:52:12.170
along came Martin Luther King
and everything is better now.

00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:13.720
And what's wrong with that message

00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:16.460
and I'm not diminishing
Martin Luther King in any way,

00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:20.960 position:56%
but it's leaving children to believe
that we have to wait for somebody

00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:23.250
to come and change
the circumstances.

00:52:23.250 --> 00:52:25.780
You have the power to
change lives in those kids.

00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:29.750
And you read about Ethel
Payne's story you get that sense.

00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:33.600
She rose up from Southside Chicago,
went halfway around the world

00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:37.620
to make her mark, came back and
served as this critical link

00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:41.700
in journalism seeking to advocate
and inform and change the world

00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:43.410
with the power of the pen.

00:52:43.410 --> 00:52:46.780
And she's part of that group and
I think our next generation need

00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:50.200
to know that story because
we're forgetting to tell it.

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.590
Thank you, you've been
really patient with me.

00:52:51.590 --> 00:52:53.510
I obviously could go
on for six hours.

00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:58.140
[ Applause ]

00:52:58.140 --> 00:52:59.600
Yes, there's a question.

00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:00.900
Please.

00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:03.430
&gt;&gt; There's a comment the gentleman
with the cigar in earlier photos.

00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:04.730
&gt;&gt; James McGrath Morris:
You can help me with my.

00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:06.590
&gt;&gt; Yes, he was the
first black reporter

00:53:06.590 --> 00:53:10.500
to lead the White House press
corps Louis [inaudible].

00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:12.690
&gt;&gt; James McGrath Morris: Thank you,
so I was having a long [inaudible].

00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:14.820
Yes, I was having a hard -- I don't
know why, you know, [inaudible].

00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:18.070
And let me tell you about him.

00:53:18.070 --> 00:53:21.260
He's a really nice guy,
but he was uncomfortable

00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:23.470
with Ethel Payne and
Allison Dunnigan.

00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:26.220
He was the one who first complained
that their questions were too long.

00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:30.640
And of course it's 1950's speak,
so he'd write them gals, you know,

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:32.270
he'd refer to them going on.

00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:35.850
But he was also, he was
like many men who had broken

00:53:35.850 --> 00:53:37.800
through professionally
who was nervous

00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:40.360 position:56%
about his position vis-a-vis whites.

00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:44.070
And so he never was asking
these tough questions

00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:47.150
that if you pardon me
the two gals were asking.

00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:51.260 position:56%
Until finally he says Mr. President,
a lot of people been asking me

00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:54.510
to ask you this question and
I'm sorry, but I have to ask it

00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:56.420
and then he asked a question.

00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:59.360
And I really say that
defensively I'm not attacking him.

00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:02.410
But what was so great for
me going back and looking

00:54:02.410 --> 00:54:05.980
at that world is they're all
three such different people trying

00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:08.970
to navigate the shoals of
racial life in Washington

00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:11.380
and the press corps and
each had a different thing.

00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:21.830 position:56%
People don't understand today when
Ethel Payne and Ray, my mind's gone,

00:54:21.830 --> 00:54:24.220
Mitchell were walking the halls

00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:28.880
of congress not only are they
senators using a word on the floor

00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:31.040
of the house that I would
not repeat in public to refer

00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:33.780
to African-Americans, but
they would brush by them

00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:36.280 position:56%
in the hall as if they didn't exist.

00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:39.550
You know that kind of just knock
into their shoulder slightly.

00:54:39.550 --> 00:54:46.840
So, you know, Louis Lautier was a
male, Ethel Payne had two things

00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:48.990
when she sat in the
back of the press corps,

00:54:48.990 --> 00:54:51.260
she was black and she was female.

00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:55.920
And so when you want to understand
her courage and say Mr. President,

00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:59.410
I first I thought it was her
confronting the great white leader

00:54:59.410 --> 00:55:02.690
of the United States, no there
was something else going on.

00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:07.320
As she said Mr. President hundred
197 male white faces turned around

00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:09.940
and looked at her, all
with the implications

00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:12.520
of where do you get the
chutzpah to ask a question.

00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:14.930
And if I were her I would have
been wearing Depends every day

00:55:14.930 --> 00:55:17.050
that I went into that audience.

00:55:17.050 --> 00:55:18.510
I mean it's a terrifying thing.

00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:21.590
And so I've tried to reconstruct
that because I mean most

00:55:21.590 --> 00:55:23.360
of you obviously know your history.

00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:26.660
But trust me when I talk to
younger audiences they're clueless

00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:29.560
to how daring an act that
was for a black woman

00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:34.040
to challenge the president in
front of 200 other white reporters.

00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:36.400
That was an act of courage.

00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:39.000
I guess I can take more questions
and I'm more than one glad

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.510
to answer more, I don't
want to keep people here.

00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:50.760
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:52.560
Yes.

00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:58.060
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:55:58.060 --> 00:56:01.610
Oh yes, including Kathleen
who's right next to you.

00:56:01.610 --> 00:56:04.810
The two things, the sadness
of her self-syndication was

00:56:04.810 --> 00:56:07.100
that she had very little
money, she got social security.

00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:10.230
And I found letters where she was
writing the paper saying, you know,

00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:13.540
you haven't paid me my 50
bucks for those columns.

00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:15.670
And the black press also

00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:18.900
at that point was losing
the power it once had.

00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:22.550
The white press had robbed the
black press of its best reporters.

00:56:22.550 --> 00:56:25.570
And let's think about one of the
reasons the Chicago Defender was

00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:30.240
so successful in 1905 and up to the
50's is that the Chicago Tribune

00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:32.730
and I'm telling it for
Chicago, it could be Baltimore.

00:56:32.730 --> 00:56:35.620
The white press had completely
ignored the black community.

00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:39.630 position:56%
And what do we want to see in
newspapers, high school graduations,

00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:42.100
obituaries, wedding announcements.

00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:44.840
Well once the white
papers began to do

00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:47.350
that it took away a lot
of the economic basis.

00:56:47.350 --> 00:56:50.320
So when she was self-syndicating
those papers didn't have much money

00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:52.580
and didn't have the
same kind of readership.

00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:56.390
I did have a chance to interview
and talk to members of her family,

00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:58.600
including her nephew
who's featured in the book

00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:01.620
who became the first
African-American page

00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:03.910
and was barred from doing that.

00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:07.800
And I'll be glad to tell you
that story later when we're done.

00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:09.350
And I did so for a
number of reasons.

00:57:09.350 --> 00:57:14.190 position:56%
One, I was approaching the story
with enormous trepidation, you know,

00:57:14.190 --> 00:57:16.930
I'm an aging white guy
who am I to write a story

00:57:16.930 --> 00:57:19.410
about a black woman in the 1950's.

00:57:19.410 --> 00:57:21.750
I made a joke at one point
to myself and, you know,

00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:24.080 position:56%
when you make a good joke it's
usually not good for everybody else,

00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:26.080
but I'm walking around the
house laughing up a storm.

00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:29.010
And I said, you know, why
can't a white guy write a story

00:57:29.010 --> 00:57:30.720
about a black woman who
became famous writing

00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:32.020
about a white bald president,

00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:34.200
I actually said a white
kind of white bald guy.

00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:36.650
But anyway and the
truth of the matter was

00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:38.320
that even though I
thought Ethel Payne

00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:41.430
and I if we got together we'd talk
about cooking because we both cook.

00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:43.540
We'd talk about the editors
who messed up our stories.

00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:44.980
We'd have all this shop talk.

00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:49.090
I still was nervous and I wasn't
going to proceed unless those

00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:51.600
who knew her thought I was okay.

00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:55.130
And so it wasn't just interviewing
them it was getting approbation

00:57:55.130 --> 00:57:58.230 position:56%
from those who knew her and then
they could look at my books and say,

00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:59.940
you know, the book
could be very different

00:57:59.940 --> 00:58:03.000
if a young black woman had
written it, but at least it's fair.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.400 position:56%
And then lastly and then I'll answer
your question, then we'll break

00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:09.510
up is that I also discovered
in two of the three places

00:58:09.510 --> 00:58:12.810
that held her papers,
[inaudible], at Howard

00:58:12.810 --> 00:58:16.850 position:56%
and Schaumburg Collection New York
the papers had never been processed,

00:58:16.850 --> 00:58:20.420
25 years after her death they
were still sitting unopened.

00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:22.710
And I thought that was an
invitation, I thought, you know,

00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:26.070 position:56%
I've got the skills as a storyteller
I'm going to go and do this story.

00:58:26.070 --> 00:58:28.210
So those are all the
things that empowered me.

00:58:28.210 --> 00:58:32.510
Quick question then
because you folks.

00:58:32.510 --> 00:58:46.090
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:58:46.090 --> 00:58:47.390
No, I never did.

00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:50.100
The closest I think I've come and
I'm looking for a photograph is

00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:54.520
in 1981 when the hostages were
freed and there was this big event

00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:56.080
on the south lawn of
the White House.

00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:57.880
Anybody who had a press
pass went to it,

00:58:57.880 --> 00:58:59.180
including me I was a reporter then.

00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:02.050
And I want to get one of those
photographs with a magnifying glass

00:59:02.050 --> 00:59:05.840 position:56%
and say, I was 72.5 feet away from
her, but I never got to meet her no.

00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:12.510
&gt;&gt; So what made you start writing
about her if you also [inaudible]

00:59:12.510 --> 00:59:14.880
if she was inspired
at all by [inaudible].

00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:16.520
&gt;&gt; James McGrath Morris: She
was, she didn't meet her,

00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:17.820
at least I never found out.

00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:19.950
But how could she not
be, they lived very close

00:59:19.950 --> 00:59:22.030 position:56%
to each other, she knew of her work.

00:59:22.030 --> 00:59:24.040
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:27.980
She knew her [inaudible], see
family already here to help me out.

00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:30.290
And, you know, when
she was struggling

00:59:30.290 --> 00:59:33.580
to become a writer the only black
woman in Chicago who made any money

00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:37.310
from writing was Ida B.
Wells, so she certainly was.

00:59:37.310 --> 00:59:41.040
There's a different risk that
they took, but I think I often --

00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:43.910
I spoke at the Ida B. Wells
conference that was held this year

00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:47.590 position:56%
and I think in many ways Ethel Payne
was the 20th century version of her.

00:59:47.590 --> 00:59:51.050
I was -- I came to her because
I was desperate for a book,

00:59:51.050 --> 00:59:53.550
I had worked on a book
for a year that fell apart

00:59:53.550 --> 00:59:55.470
and I had written books
about journalists.

00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:59.490
So I went to the Google and made a
list a hundred famous journalists

00:59:59.490 --> 01:00:02.710
in the 20th century, Walter
Cronkite, all these people

01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:04.740
and Ethel Payne's name
showed up on it.

01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:08.700
And I used to like pat myself and
say I had some idea who she was,

01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:10.570
the truth of the matter
is I was clueless.

01:00:10.570 --> 01:00:14.490 position:56%
So I began looking into her life and
thought this is too great a story,

01:00:14.490 --> 01:00:16.870
somebody's bound to
be working on it.

01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:19.810
And then as I found out the
papers had never been processed

01:00:19.810 --> 01:00:22.650
and all these kinds of things
it seemed to me an invitation

01:00:22.650 --> 01:00:25.870
that if no one else was going
to do it I better get cracking.

01:00:25.870 --> 01:00:29.930
So I love journalism, I like
the power of journalism change

01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:32.650
and I also I am one of
those people who was swept

01:00:32.650 --> 01:00:33.950 position:56%
up by the story of the civil rights.

01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:35.350
I've always studied
it, I wrote a piece

01:00:35.350 --> 01:00:38.880
about how Arlington was the
instrumental place in breaking

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:42.110
down massive resistance, so
[inaudible] original scholarship

01:00:42.110 --> 01:00:43.520
about and I'm interested

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:45.490
in the civil rights
movement from the bottom up.

01:00:45.490 --> 01:00:49.540
I'm not writing a biography
of some famous person.

01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:52.310
So those all combined to do it.

01:00:52.310 --> 01:00:54.200 position:56%
And when Kathy and others said yeah,

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:57.140
you're okay you could
probably do it, then I was.

01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:59.320
&gt;&gt; You did an excellent job.

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:01.720
&gt;&gt; James McGrath Morris:
Well thank you, well thanks.

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:03.550
So I'm glad to stick around.

01:01:03.550 --> 01:01:05.000
You guys, you know, you want

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.010
to get a sandwich before you
get back to work or something.

01:01:07.010 --> 01:01:09.410
But I'll be signing books and
I'll stay and answer questions

01:01:09.410 --> 01:01:10.710
as long as anybody wants.

01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:14.490
And thank you for letting
me rattle on so long.

01:01:14.490 --> 01:01:17.050
&gt;&gt; This has been a
presentation of the Library

01:01:17.050 --> 01:01:20.490
of Congress, visit us at LOC.gov.
