00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.524
- [Voiceover] Alright everyone.

00:00:01.524 --> 00:00:03.259
We've gotten to one of
my all-time favorite

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:06.267
multi-variable calculus
topics, divergence.

00:00:06.267 --> 00:00:08.376
In the next few videos I'm gonna describe

00:00:08.376 --> 00:00:10.502
what it is mathematically
and how you compute it

00:00:10.502 --> 00:00:12.504
and all of that but
here I just want to give

00:00:12.504 --> 00:00:15.000
a very visual understanding of what it is

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.380
that it's trying to represent.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.782
So I've got a picture in
front of us, a vector field.

00:00:20.782 --> 00:00:22.516
I've said before that a pretty neat way

00:00:22.516 --> 00:00:24.499
to understand vector
fields is to think of them

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:26.406
as representing a fluid flow.

00:00:26.406 --> 00:00:28.398
What I mean by that is you can think of

00:00:28.398 --> 00:00:31.174
every single point in space as a particle,

00:00:31.174 --> 00:00:33.559
maybe an air particle or a water particle.

00:00:34.499 --> 00:00:35.947
Something to that effect.

00:00:35.947 --> 00:00:37.751
Since what a vector field does

00:00:37.751 --> 00:00:39.775
is it associates each point in space

00:00:39.775 --> 00:00:41.646
with some kind of vector

00:00:41.646 --> 00:00:43.932
and remember I mean, whenever
we represent vector fields,

00:00:43.932 --> 00:00:46.381
we only show a small subset
of all of those vectors,

00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:48.763
but in principle you should be thinking of

00:00:48.763 --> 00:00:51.290
every one of those infinitely
many points in space

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.671
being associated with
one of these vectors.

00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:56.003
The fact that they're
kind of smoothly changing

00:00:56.003 --> 00:00:57.607
as you traverse across space

00:00:57.607 --> 00:01:00.793
,means that showing this
very small finite subsample

00:01:00.793 --> 00:01:02.675
of those infinitely many vectors

00:01:02.675 --> 00:01:04.998
still gives a pretty good
feel for what's going on.

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:07.002
So if we have these fluid particles

00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:09.874
and you have a vector
assigned to each one,

00:01:09.874 --> 00:01:12.257
kind of a natural thought
you might have is to say

00:01:12.257 --> 00:01:15.096
what would happen if you let
things progress over time

00:01:15.096 --> 00:01:18.702
where at any given instant
the velocity of one of

00:01:18.702 --> 00:01:21.822
these particles is given by
that vector connected to it.

00:01:21.822 --> 00:01:24.040
As it moves it will be
touching a different vector.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.436
So it's velocity might turn.

00:01:25.436 --> 00:01:26.983
It might go in a different direction.

00:01:26.983 --> 00:01:29.243
For each one it will kind
of traverse some path

00:01:29.243 --> 00:01:32.243
as determined by the vectors
that it's touching as it goes

00:01:32.243 --> 00:01:34.537
and when you think of all
of them doing this at once,

00:01:34.537 --> 00:01:37.503
it will feel like a certain fluid flow.

00:01:37.503 --> 00:01:39.409
For this you don't
actually have to imagine.

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.227
I went ahead and put together
an animation for you.

00:01:42.227 --> 00:01:44.762
So we'll put some water molecules or dots

00:01:44.762 --> 00:01:47.130
to represent a small sample
of the water molecules

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.765
throughout space here and then
I'm just gonna let it play

00:01:49.765 --> 00:01:54.248
where each one moves along the
vector that it's closest to.

00:01:54.248 --> 00:01:56.496
I'll just let it play forward here

00:01:56.496 --> 00:01:58.923
where each one is flowing along the vector

00:01:58.923 --> 00:02:02.012
that's touching the point
where it is in that moment.

00:02:04.742 --> 00:02:07.289
So for example, if we were to go back

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.668
and maybe focus our
attention on just one vector

00:02:09.668 --> 00:02:12.252
like this guy, one particle, excuse me,

00:02:12.252 --> 00:02:14.291
he's attached to this
vector so he'll be moving

00:02:14.291 --> 00:02:16.006
in that direction but just for an instant

00:02:16.006 --> 00:02:17.252
because after he moves a little

00:02:17.252 --> 00:02:18.873
he'll be attached to a different vector.

00:02:18.873 --> 00:02:22.991
So if you kind of let it play
and follow that particular dot

00:02:22.991 --> 00:02:26.533
after a little bit you'll
find him elsewhere.

00:02:26.533 --> 00:02:28.419
I think this is the one, right.

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:30.248
Now he's gonna be moving along this vector

00:02:30.248 --> 00:02:32.769
or whatever one is really attached to him.

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.510
Thinking about all of the
particles all at once doing this

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.761
gives a sort of global
view of the vector field.

00:02:38.761 --> 00:02:40.841
If you're studying math,
you might start to ask

00:02:40.841 --> 00:02:43.991
some natural questions about
the nature of that fluid flow.

00:02:43.991 --> 00:02:46.559
For example, you might
wonder if you were to just

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:49.044
look in a certain region
and count the number

00:02:49.044 --> 00:02:51.323
of water molecules that
are inside that region,

00:02:51.323 --> 00:02:53.534
does that count of yours change

00:02:53.534 --> 00:02:56.254
as you play this animation,

00:02:56.254 --> 00:02:58.282
as you let this flow over time?

00:02:58.282 --> 00:02:59.989
In this particular example you can look

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.228
and it doesn't look
like the count changes.

00:03:02.228 --> 00:03:03.273
Certainly not that much.

00:03:03.273 --> 00:03:06.248
It's not increasing over
time or decreasing over time

00:03:06.248 --> 00:03:08.183
In a little bit, if I
gave you the function

00:03:08.183 --> 00:03:09.751
that determines this vector field,

00:03:09.751 --> 00:03:12.034
you will be able to tell
me why it's the case

00:03:12.034 --> 00:03:14.383
that the number of
molecules in that region

00:03:14.383 --> 00:03:15.993
doesn't tend to change

00:03:15.993 --> 00:03:17.892
but if you were to look
at another example,

00:03:17.892 --> 00:03:20.983
like a guy that looks like this

00:03:20.983 --> 00:03:22.510
and if I were to say I want you to focus

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.474
on what happens around the origin,

00:03:24.474 --> 00:03:26.219
in that little region around the origin,

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:29.269
you can probably predict
how once I start playing it,

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.245
once I put some water molecules in there

00:03:31.245 --> 00:03:34.264
and let them flow along the
vectors that they flow along,

00:03:34.264 --> 00:03:38.510
the density inside that region
around the origin decreases.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.035
So we put a whole bunch of vectors there

00:03:40.035 --> 00:03:41.257
and I'll just play it for a quick instant.

00:03:41.257 --> 00:03:43.742
Just kind of let it jump for an instant.

00:03:43.742 --> 00:03:46.264
One thing that characterizes
this field around the origin

00:03:46.264 --> 00:03:48.520
is that decrease in density.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.264
What you might say if you
wanted to be suggestive

00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:53.410
of the operation that I'm leading to here

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.505
is that the water
molecules tend to diverge

00:03:55.505 --> 00:03:57.001
away from the origin.

00:03:57.001 --> 00:03:59.325
So the kind of divergence
of the vector field

00:03:59.325 --> 00:04:01.338
near that origin is positive.

00:04:01.338 --> 00:04:03.077
You'll see what I mean
mathematically by that

00:04:03.077 --> 00:04:04.745
in the next couple videos,

00:04:04.745 --> 00:04:06.954
but if we were to flip
over these vectors, right,

00:04:06.954 --> 00:04:08.282
if we were to flip them around,

00:04:08.282 --> 00:04:10.250
now if I were to ask about the density

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.188
in that same region around the origin,

00:04:12.188 --> 00:04:14.159
we can probably see how
it's gonna increase.

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:18.247
When I play that fluid flow
over just a short spurt of time,

00:04:18.247 --> 00:04:20.763
the density in the region increases.

00:04:20.763 --> 00:04:23.243
So these don't diverge away, they converge

00:04:23.243 --> 00:04:26.012
towards the origin.

00:04:26.012 --> 00:04:28.769
That fact actually has some
mathematical significance

00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:31.503
for the function representing
this vector field

00:04:31.503 --> 00:04:33.036
around that point.

00:04:33.036 --> 00:04:35.220
Even if the vector field
doesn't represent fluid flow,

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.846
if it represents a magnetic field

00:04:36.846 --> 00:04:40.886
or an electric field or things like that,

00:04:40.886 --> 00:04:43.352
there's a certain meaning to this idea

00:04:43.352 --> 00:04:46.262
of diverging away from a point
or converging to a point.

00:04:46.262 --> 00:04:49.267
Another way that people
sometimes think about this,

00:04:49.267 --> 00:04:50.739
if you look at that same kind of

00:04:50.739 --> 00:04:53.258
outward-flowing vector field

00:04:53.258 --> 00:04:55.512
as rather than thinking
of a decrease in density,

00:04:55.512 --> 00:04:57.763
imagining that the fluid
would have to constantly

00:04:57.763 --> 00:04:59.834
be repopulated around that point.

00:04:59.834 --> 00:05:02.285
So you're really thinking of
the origin as a source of fluid

00:05:02.285 --> 00:05:03.920
and if I had animated this better,

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.004
a whole bunch of other points
should be sources of fluid

00:05:06.004 --> 00:05:08.085
so that the density doesn't
decrease everywhere,

00:05:08.085 --> 00:05:11.136
but the idea is that points
of positive divergence

00:05:11.136 --> 00:05:12.994
where things are diverging away

00:05:12.994 --> 00:05:15.068
would have to have a source of that fluid

00:05:15.068 --> 00:05:17.154
in order to kind of
keep things sustaining.

00:05:17.154 --> 00:05:19.928
Conversely, if you were to look
at that kind of inward flow

00:05:19.928 --> 00:05:23.249
or what you might call
negative divergence example

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:25.763
and you were to play it but
it were to go continuously,

00:05:25.763 --> 00:05:27.740
you'd have to think of
that center point as a sink

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.930
where all the fluid kind
of just sort of flows away.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.459
That's actually a technical term.

00:05:31.459 --> 00:05:33.305
People will say the
vector field has a sink

00:05:33.305 --> 00:05:36.366
at such and such point or
the electromagnetic field

00:05:36.366 --> 00:05:37.756
has a sink at such and such point

00:05:37.756 --> 00:05:40.451
and that often has a certain significance.

00:05:40.451 --> 00:05:43.767
If we go back to that
original example here

00:05:43.767 --> 00:05:46.517
where there is no change
in fluid density, right,

00:05:46.517 --> 00:05:48.756
what you might notice,
this feels a lot more like

00:05:48.756 --> 00:05:50.497
actual water than the other ones

00:05:50.497 --> 00:05:53.128
because there is no
change in density there.

00:05:53.128 --> 00:05:55.267
If you can find a way to
mathematically describe

00:05:55.267 --> 00:05:58.500
that lack of a change in density,

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.159
it's a pretty good way
to model water flow.

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:03.005
Again, even if it's not water flow

00:06:03.005 --> 00:06:04.874
but it's something like
the electromagnetic field,

00:06:04.874 --> 00:06:06.475
there's often a significance to this

00:06:06.475 --> 00:06:09.005
no changing in density idea.

00:06:09.005 --> 00:06:10.952
So with that I think
I've jabbered on enough

00:06:10.952 --> 00:06:12.928
about the visuals of it
and in the next video

00:06:12.928 --> 00:06:15.552
I'll tell you what
divergence is mathematically,

00:06:15.552 --> 00:06:17.899
how you compute it, go
through a couple examples,

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:18.848
things like that.

00:06:18.848 --> 00:06:19.760
See you next video.
