<i> - I don't give a fuck about my
 my mama's tears.</i>

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:07.740
What I care about is this.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.577
I was in the fucking vestibule
area with my balls lifted up

00:00:11.577 --> 00:00:15.448
squatted, letting this fucking
child predator look at me.

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:17.350
This is what I'm fucking focused
on.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.220
I'm killin' Mitchell, and I
already put it in my mind.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.620
[engine revs]

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.857

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:42.208

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:45.311
[gunshot]

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:52.619

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:25.451
[cheers and applause]

00:01:25.451 --> 00:01:28.487
- I'm super excited to have this
guy back--he told my favorite

00:01:28.487 --> 00:01:29.522
story ever on this show.

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:30.856
You guys are gonna love him.

00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:32.826
Give it up for
Mr. Ali Siddiq, everybody.

00:01:32.826 --> 00:01:33.626
Let him hear it.

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:38.965
[cheers and applause]

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:40.833
<i> - This is what happens</i>

00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:45.338
when you take a 19-year-old boy,
and put him in prison.

00:01:45.338 --> 00:01:47.607
This is what happens.

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:51.477
Now, I'm 21 at the time,
but I just settled in

00:01:51.477 --> 00:01:54.213
to the prison now;
been there for a while.

00:01:54.213 --> 00:01:57.383
But in prison, you have
things that you're

00:01:57.383 --> 00:01:59.953
very particular about.

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:04.023
Like, I told my celly, "Hey, no
peeing standing up

00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:05.357
"in this cell.

00:02:05.357 --> 00:02:07.360
You have to sit down and pee."

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.694
Because of this.

00:02:08.694 --> 00:02:12.831
I pray on the floor, and so if
you urinate,

00:02:12.831 --> 00:02:16.502
you splash urine all over the
place, I'ma kill you.

00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:20.706
[laughter]

00:02:20.706 --> 00:02:25.311
All right, just setting the
tone.

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:32.084
So you start to develop certain
type of phobias about things.

00:02:32.084 --> 00:02:34.887
I developed this phobia when I
first got to this place

00:02:34.887 --> 00:02:37.389
called diagnostics in prison.

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:39.892
It's a--it's basically slavery.

00:02:39.892 --> 00:02:41.727
It's, like, a bunch of fences.

00:02:41.727 --> 00:02:43.229
You in one fence.

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:45.598
It's, like--it's a space for,
like, 80 people,

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:48.534
but they ram, like, 200 people
in this space,

00:02:48.534 --> 00:02:50.904
and you just trying to get your
space.

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:52.738
You don't want nobody behind
you.

00:02:52.738 --> 00:02:54.006
You don't want nobody's butt in
front of you.

00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:57.209
You just want to maintain your
space.

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.080
So that's the first--the first
little cage,

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.185
and you have on clothes, so they
move you to the second cage,

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:07.853
and they tell you to take off
all your clothes.

00:03:07.853 --> 00:03:11.090
Now you naked with the same
bunch of people smashed in,

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.527
so now you back trying to get
your space.

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:15.962
You don't want nobody behind
you.

00:03:15.962 --> 00:03:17.430
Don't want nobody in front of
you.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.064
Trying to get your space.

00:03:19.064 --> 00:03:21.100
Dude--we all naked, so dude come
over and talk to me and say,

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.202
"Hey, man, what's going on?
What you in here for?"

00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:25.637
"Hey, dude, get the fuck away
from me.

00:03:25.637 --> 00:03:28.608
I'm naked, and you in my space."

00:03:28.608 --> 00:03:32.812
[laughter]

00:03:32.812 --> 00:03:35.815
So I'm not really comfortable
being naked with a--

00:03:35.815 --> 00:03:38.785
a plethora
of men--I'm not--that's not

00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:41.053
where I'm at with my life.

00:03:41.053 --> 00:03:42.454
[laughter]

00:03:42.454 --> 00:03:46.625
So...movin' forward, now I'm in
prison, and I remember

00:03:46.625 --> 00:03:48.127
somethin' my uncle told me: he
said,

00:03:48.127 --> 00:03:50.129
"You never wanna be naked in
prison.

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.965
"You buy some shorts off
commissary, and they can't make

00:03:52.965 --> 00:03:56.068
you take off the shorts 'cause
the shorts are not contraband."

00:03:56.068 --> 00:03:58.604
Cool. I've been having these
shorts--

00:03:58.604 --> 00:04:01.140
this was my first purchase.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.309
A lot of people purchase other
things on commissary,

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:04.643
soup and food.

00:04:04.643 --> 00:04:07.947
I bought a pair of white shorts,
$7.00.

00:04:07.947 --> 00:04:09.315
Best purchase
I've made in prison.

00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:10.949
[laughter]

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:15.321
So I wear these shorts every
day--even if I wear my boxers,

00:04:15.321 --> 00:04:19.491
I wear the shorts on under my
boxers 'cause I already know any

00:04:19.491 --> 00:04:22.461
time, you can be strip searched,
and I know the rules,

00:04:22.461 --> 00:04:25.031
'cause I was the fire and safety
clerk, you see.

00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:27.500
Let me tell you, fine--it's
power.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.169
I know everything about this
prison, 'cause I worked for

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.204
Scarborough, which is the fire
and safety man.

00:04:32.204 --> 00:04:34.606
I'm the fire and safety clerk,
so I don't want nobody

00:04:34.606 --> 00:04:38.477
fucking with me, stripping down,
nothing.

00:04:38.477 --> 00:04:42.515
So most of the time, I'm a--I'm
a well-respected young guy

00:04:42.515 --> 00:04:44.384
in this prison, 'cause I've been
here since I was

00:04:44.384 --> 00:04:48.453
19, now I'm 21, and I'm just
gaining my stripes.

00:04:48.453 --> 00:04:50.656
Officers respect me,
cause I'm respectable.

00:04:50.656 --> 00:04:53.493
And I'm so respectable that
officers don't do this.

00:04:53.493 --> 00:04:56.362
When they call--there's this
thing they call chow time.

00:04:56.362 --> 00:04:59.499
That's when people run out the
door to go eat

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:00.866
like fucking cattle.

00:05:00.866 --> 00:05:02.868
I said, "Hey, don't talk to me
like that.

00:05:02.868 --> 00:05:04.369
I'm a civilized human being."

00:05:04.369 --> 00:05:06.472
And the officers were like, "Oh,
chow time."

00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:09.708
Then they'd turn around, "Ali,
excuse me, lunch for you."

00:05:09.708 --> 00:05:11.143
I'm like, "Thank you, sir."

00:05:11.143 --> 00:05:12.545
[laughter]

00:05:12.545 --> 00:05:14.680
'Cause I'm very civilized.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.986
So now, I'm--I'm about to become
uncivilized because there's

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:23.322
an officer named Mitch--
it's always somebody--

00:05:23.322 --> 00:05:25.991
when a bunch of people like you,
it's always somebody who

00:05:25.991 --> 00:05:28.661
doesn't like you, and they're
trying to prove a point.

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:30.896
So Mitchell sees me, and let me
tell you who Mitchell look like.

00:05:30.896 --> 00:05:34.266
Mitchell looked the dude--what's
the dude, Flanders,

00:05:34.266 --> 00:05:35.935
on "The Simpsons"?

00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:39.772
Who's always like a fucking
pedophile to me, always.

00:05:39.772 --> 00:05:43.742
So I'm comin' through, for no
random reason, Mitchell pulls me

00:05:43.742 --> 00:05:46.579
over in this area--
I'm on building eight,

00:05:46.579 --> 00:05:50.716
is where I stay at, and
it's a high traffic area--

00:05:50.716 --> 00:05:52.218
the vestibule area.

00:05:52.218 --> 00:05:55.254
He stops me in the fuckin'
vestibule area, and say,

00:05:55.254 --> 00:05:58.223
"Hey, I think you have some
contraband.

00:05:58.223 --> 00:06:00.425
"I'm gonna shake you down."
I'm like, "Yo, Mitchell, I just

00:06:00.425 --> 00:06:03.362
"came from necessities, I don't
have no fuckin' contraband.

00:06:03.362 --> 00:06:05.230
Get the fuck out of here."

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.099
You know, and put your hands
down while you're talking to me,

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:09.034
'cause you supposed to stay
three feet away from me,

00:06:09.034 --> 00:06:10.903
'cause you know I'm the fucking
fire and safety clerk,

00:06:10.903 --> 00:06:13.439
so don't fucking break the
rules.

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:15.908
[laughter]

00:06:15.908 --> 00:06:17.977
So he say, "Well, I'm gonna
strip search you."

00:06:17.977 --> 00:06:21.480
I'm like, no, you're not--
not in this high traffic

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.383
area--no, you're not, sir.
So he calls the rest of these

00:06:24.383 --> 00:06:27.453
other officers around, some
fucking rookies that don't

00:06:27.453 --> 00:06:30.289
know me, and and he's
like, "Yo, you gonna have to

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:31.624
take off your clothes."

00:06:31.624 --> 00:06:35.260
So I took off all of their white
shit--their clothes.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.963
Gave it to him--nothing.
I got my shorts on.

00:06:36.963 --> 00:06:38.597
I'm standin' there.

00:06:38.597 --> 00:06:41.567
He say, "You're gonna have to
take them shorts off."

00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:45.337
I say, "That's not the rules,
Mitchell, not the rules."

00:06:45.337 --> 00:06:46.838
[laughter]

00:06:46.838 --> 00:06:50.743
And now I'm getting a little--
a little heated about this,

00:06:50.743 --> 00:06:54.313
because I know I have a problem
with being naked

00:06:54.313 --> 00:06:57.149
in the fucking hallway, and I
know that I have a problem

00:06:57.149 --> 00:06:59.985
with this, and I'm trying to get
Mitchell to understand.

00:06:59.985 --> 00:07:03.489
"Mitchell, this is not gonna be
good."

00:07:03.489 --> 00:07:05.991
[laughter]

00:07:05.991 --> 00:07:07.526
"Mitchell, Mitchell, Mitchell."

00:07:07.526 --> 00:07:12.098
I'm trying to explain to
Mitchell, "Mitchell..."

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:14.600
so he gets all the rest of these
officers around.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.671
The captain comes up and says,
"I can't go against my officer--

00:07:19.671 --> 00:07:23.008
"he say you got contraband.
You gonna have to get naked."

00:07:23.008 --> 00:07:27.279
I say, "Captain, if I get naked
in this hallway, in front

00:07:27.279 --> 00:07:29.515
"of all these people comin'
in and out..." and I turned

00:07:29.515 --> 00:07:33.019
right to Mitchell and looked at
him in his eyes and said,

00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:34.820
"This ain't gonna
be good, Mitchell."

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.555
[laughter]

00:07:36.555 --> 00:07:40.693
"Because I don't give a shit
about goin' home at this point.

00:07:40.693 --> 00:07:44.363
"I came here with 15 years,
Mitchell, I wanna do these

00:07:44.363 --> 00:07:48.901
"little 15 years and go home.
But if you make me get naked

00:07:48.901 --> 00:07:51.804
"in this motherfuckin'
vestibule area..."

00:07:51.804 --> 00:07:53.372
[laughter]

00:07:53.372 --> 00:07:55.841
So they got all these officers
around me,

00:07:55.841 --> 00:07:59.378
and I done threatened this man
with the easiest way I can

00:07:59.378 --> 00:08:01.413
threaten him without getting
sent to cell.

00:08:01.413 --> 00:08:04.149
I said, "Mitchell, this ain't
gonna be good, brother."

00:08:04.149 --> 00:08:09.689
So long story short,
I end up naked, and I'm pissed.

00:08:09.689 --> 00:08:12.591
I'm naked and I'm bald-headed,
and then he takin' me through

00:08:12.591 --> 00:08:15.761
this bullshit: "Run your
fingers through your hair."

00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:18.364
[laughter]

00:08:22.067 --> 00:08:24.403
"Open your mouth."

00:08:24.403 --> 00:08:25.938
"I've been talking this whole
time.

00:08:25.938 --> 00:08:27.840
"If something was in my mouth,
Mitchell,

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.341
it'd have been fell out."

00:08:29.341 --> 00:08:32.245
"Open your mouth."

00:08:35.881 --> 00:08:39.085
"Lift up your balls."

00:08:40.853 --> 00:08:43.022
"Squat."

00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:45.857
Let me explain what he just did:
I went to prison

00:08:45.857 --> 00:08:49.094
for a nonviolent case,
drug dealing.

00:08:49.094 --> 00:08:51.763
What he just turned me into

00:08:51.763 --> 00:08:55.301
was a violent young man at 21.

00:08:55.301 --> 00:08:57.703
Because you made me
cough and squat

00:08:57.703 --> 00:08:59.471
for no fuckin' reason,

00:08:59.471 --> 00:09:03.108
other than that you wanted
see me, in my mind.

00:09:03.108 --> 00:09:06.645
So now I'm--I got tears in my
eyes,

00:09:06.645 --> 00:09:08.247
and people are walking past.

00:09:08.247 --> 00:09:10.749
Other prisoners are walking
past, and they looking at

00:09:10.749 --> 00:09:13.452
Mitchell like, "Mitchell..."

00:09:13.452 --> 00:09:14.820
[laughter]

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.722
"This ain't gonna be good."

00:09:16.722 --> 00:09:19.825
[laughter]

00:09:19.825 --> 00:09:24.763
So for eight months, I been
planning on killin' Mitchell.

00:09:24.763 --> 00:09:28.301
[laughter]

00:09:30.168 --> 00:09:34.907
Like, I done wrote my mama this
coded--this coded letter

00:09:34.907 --> 00:09:38.577
lettin' her know that her son
ain't comin' home no mo'.

00:09:38.577 --> 00:09:40.313
I told--this is what I wrote in
the letter.

00:09:40.313 --> 00:09:42.614
I said, "Mama, prison is like
judicial slavery.

00:09:42.614 --> 00:09:47.319
I just figured this out,
and I'm Nat Turner."

00:09:47.319 --> 00:09:48.987
[laughter]

00:09:48.987 --> 00:09:50.789
You had to know about history to
know.

00:09:50.789 --> 00:09:51.924
Y'all will figure it out.

00:09:51.924 --> 00:09:53.825
[laughter]

00:09:53.825 --> 00:09:58.430
And my mom writes me a letter
back like, "Just chill,"

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:01.634
and she about a face with tears
on the face, and I'm, like,

00:10:01.634 --> 00:10:03.268
looking--I don't even, like, I
don't give a fuck

00:10:03.268 --> 00:10:04.803
about my mama's tears.

00:10:04.803 --> 00:10:06.538
What I care about is this.

00:10:06.538 --> 00:10:10.843
I was in the fucking vestibule
area with my balls lifted up

00:10:10.843 --> 00:10:14.680
squatted, fucking coughing,
letting this fucking child

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.181
predator look at me.

00:10:16.181 --> 00:10:17.950
This is what I'm fucking focused
on.

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.719
I'm killin' Mitchell, and I
already put it in my mind--

00:10:20.719 --> 00:10:22.821
It's done.
[laughter]

00:10:22.821 --> 00:10:25.524
So I done told two people.

00:10:25.524 --> 00:10:27.493
I told two people,

00:10:27.493 --> 00:10:30.696
Allamine--his name is Leslie
Davis--

00:10:30.696 --> 00:10:32.531
and Mustapha.

00:10:32.531 --> 00:10:35.667
I don't know Mustapha's name,
'cause I was so terrified

00:10:35.667 --> 00:10:39.038
of Mustapha, I never wanted to
ask him his real name,

00:10:39.038 --> 00:10:40.372
'cause then what happens?

00:10:40.372 --> 00:10:42.741
Somebody bust him for something
else in prison,

00:10:42.741 --> 00:10:44.643
then I know is real name, then
it's back on me.

00:10:44.643 --> 00:10:45.678
Didn't want to know.

00:10:45.678 --> 00:10:47.012
[laughter]

00:10:47.012 --> 00:10:48.714
So I told Mustapha--Mustapha was
like,

00:10:48.714 --> 00:10:50.849
"Yeah, that was foul what
Mitchell did."

00:10:50.849 --> 00:10:53.218
Mustapha been here for
27 years--if I kill somebody,

00:10:53.218 --> 00:10:56.221
I know he down.
[laughter]

00:10:56.221 --> 00:10:59.725
Allamine got 50 years,
he ain't goin' nowhere.

00:10:59.725 --> 00:11:01.560
I plan on spendin'
the rest of my life

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.831
with Allamine and Mustapha--
[laughter]

00:11:05.831 --> 00:11:08.734
'cause I'm gonna kill Mitchell.
I already know this.

00:11:08.734 --> 00:11:10.836
[laughter]

00:11:10.836 --> 00:11:13.405
Don't know how,

00:11:13.405 --> 00:11:15.874
but, like anything in my life,

00:11:15.874 --> 00:11:20.245
somethin' is gonna break.
This dude--I'm comin' from

00:11:20.245 --> 00:11:22.748
eatin', this dude say,
"Hey, 'Li."

00:11:22.748 --> 00:11:24.216
I said, "What's up, man?"

00:11:24.216 --> 00:11:28.120
He say, "You know Mitchell
is working the 4 gate."

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.023
I said, "What?"
Now my job in--in prison,

00:11:31.023 --> 00:11:34.259
I haven't been happy about
nothin' in a long time.

00:11:34.259 --> 00:11:36.795
The man told me that he was
working 4 gate,

00:11:36.795 --> 00:11:38.263
I got fuckin' excited.

00:11:38.263 --> 00:11:39.531
Let me tell you what 4 gate is.

00:11:39.531 --> 00:11:42.367
4 gate is the gate to closed
custody.

00:11:42.367 --> 00:11:43.969
I live on 8 building.

00:11:43.969 --> 00:11:45.938
You got to go to 4 building if
you going to closed custody.

00:11:45.938 --> 00:11:48.541
When you come around the corner
in 4 building, it's, like,

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:50.442
you've got to come past the
cafeteria,

00:11:50.442 --> 00:11:53.945
and then it's the main building
this way, and then it's this

00:11:53.945 --> 00:11:58.117
little side hallway, and you
can't see anybody

00:11:58.117 --> 00:11:59.885
until you come around that
corner.

00:11:59.885 --> 00:12:02.754
And Mitchell was at a gate
around that corner,

00:12:02.754 --> 00:12:06.124
which is a good--he's not gonna
make it if I get to him.

00:12:06.124 --> 00:12:07.559
He's not gonna make it.

00:12:07.559 --> 00:12:08.961
[laughter]

00:12:08.961 --> 00:12:11.129
And then it's that gate, and
then it's the gate to 4

00:12:11.129 --> 00:12:14.433
building, so it's a long way to
get to him,

00:12:14.433 --> 00:12:16.602
then it's another long way to
get to that door.

00:12:16.602 --> 00:12:18.503
I got a plan.

00:12:18.503 --> 00:12:21.807
I'ma just run and just fucking
just try to get through that

00:12:21.807 --> 00:12:26.144
gate and just stab Mitchell, but
that's stupid; that's stupid.

00:12:26.144 --> 00:12:27.813
So...

00:12:27.813 --> 00:12:28.981
[laughter]

00:12:28.981 --> 00:12:31.817
I go back to my cell,

00:12:31.817 --> 00:12:34.319
and I'm sitting up trying to map
out a plan on how

00:12:34.319 --> 00:12:35.988
I can fucking kill this dude.

00:12:35.988 --> 00:12:39.992
And then I hear, "Get ready
to go to 4 building."

00:12:39.992 --> 00:12:44.663
I look out my cell door--it's a
dude that got in trouble,

00:12:44.663 --> 00:12:47.132
now he's gettin' sent
to 4 building.

00:12:47.132 --> 00:12:49.668
He has this big, white bucket
with all this shit in it,

00:12:49.668 --> 00:12:53.038
and I say, "Hey, you going to 4
building?"

00:12:53.038 --> 00:12:54.372
He say, "Yeah."

00:12:54.372 --> 00:12:57.009
I say, "Let me carry
your mattress for you."

00:12:57.009 --> 00:12:58.844
He say,
"Cool, I need some help."

00:12:58.844 --> 00:13:03.549
I go upstairs, get my knife,
put my--strap my shit on me,

00:13:03.549 --> 00:13:06.652
boom--I got a big-ass mattress
over my shoulder,

00:13:06.652 --> 00:13:11.890
so you can't see my face.
He's rollin' the bucket,

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:14.660
mattress over me,
come around the building,

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:18.497
and I'm so fucking excited,
'cause I'm going to kill

00:13:18.497 --> 00:13:20.198
Mitchell, and I'm gonna drink a
sip of his blood,

00:13:20.198 --> 00:13:22.501
'cause I fucking hate him that
bad.

00:13:22.501 --> 00:13:24.069
[laughter]

00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:27.005
When they find me, I'ma be like,
"Yeah," Mitchell on my...

00:13:27.005 --> 00:13:29.841
I'm--I'm--oh, can't fucking
wait.

00:13:29.841 --> 00:13:33.378
Oh, I'm so violent.
I can't wait.

00:13:33.378 --> 00:13:36.549
So I got this knife, and I got
this mattress,

00:13:36.549 --> 00:13:38.517
and this dude--and man, this
dude, he has no idea

00:13:38.517 --> 00:13:40.252
what's gonna happen.

00:13:40.252 --> 00:13:44.823
He's--he's accessory to this
crime, and he is so unaware.

00:13:44.823 --> 00:13:46.859
He's just rollin'--he rollin'
his bucket talking about

00:13:46.859 --> 00:13:48.493
his family, man.

00:13:48.493 --> 00:13:50.162
"It's fucked up. My family ain't
gonna get to visit me."

00:13:50.162 --> 00:13:51.597
I'm like, "Good.
Mine ain't either."

00:13:51.597 --> 00:13:54.400
[laughter]

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.703
So we coming around the
building.

00:13:58.703 --> 00:14:01.507
We coming past the fucking chow
hall,

00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:03.408
and I'm just getting more and
more excited,

00:14:03.408 --> 00:14:06.612
'cause this is gonna be a good
one.

00:14:06.612 --> 00:14:10.849
Somebody apparently tells,
'cause Allamine's

00:14:10.849 --> 00:14:12.250
looking for me, apparently.

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:13.752
He's like, "Yo, where Ali at?"

00:14:13.752 --> 00:14:17.055
He said, "Ali, helped old boy
move to 4 building."

00:14:17.055 --> 00:14:19.925
And Mustapha--'cause I get this
all--the backstory--

00:14:19.925 --> 00:14:24.396
Mustapha said, "Yeah, he going
to 4 building."

00:14:24.396 --> 00:14:27.799
And Leslie--Allamine--say, "Hey,
man, I think Mitchell on

00:14:27.799 --> 00:14:29.234
4 building."

00:14:29.234 --> 00:14:31.936
Mustapha say, "Mitchell on 4
building?

00:14:31.936 --> 00:14:34.740
Man, let's go get this boy,
'cause he gonna kill Mitchell."

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:36.741
[laughter]

00:14:36.741 --> 00:14:39.111
Now, and it's complicated,
'cause they got to get out

00:14:39.111 --> 00:14:40.379
of 8 building first.

00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:41.713
You got to get out of 8
building.

00:14:41.713 --> 00:14:43.148
You got to get--bust out your
part,

00:14:43.148 --> 00:14:44.449
come out of 8 building.

00:14:44.449 --> 00:14:45.884
I'm thinking I'm good.

00:14:45.884 --> 00:14:47.786
I've got enough time to commit
this murder

00:14:47.786 --> 00:14:50.989
and hopefully get away with it
after I sip his blood.

00:14:50.989 --> 00:14:53.625
[laughter]

00:14:53.625 --> 00:14:54.993
Boom.

00:14:54.993 --> 00:14:57.162
So we coming around the corner.

00:14:57.162 --> 00:14:58.964
The dude has the bucket.

00:14:58.964 --> 00:15:00.165
He's going through.

00:15:00.165 --> 00:15:03.468
Mitchell opens the gate.

00:15:03.468 --> 00:15:07.172
And I'm like, yes, but he don't
see me.

00:15:07.172 --> 00:15:10.809
He can't see me, 'cause I have
the mattress over my shoulder.

00:15:10.809 --> 00:15:14.613
And as the bucket goes through
the gate,

00:15:14.613 --> 00:15:16.681
it's--the path is clear.

00:15:16.681 --> 00:15:19.117
All I got to do is wait for that
bucket to get out the way,

00:15:19.117 --> 00:15:21.086
then Mitchell will be standing
at the edge of that gate.

00:15:21.086 --> 00:15:22.654
I can walk
through my mattress

00:15:22.654 --> 00:15:25.824
and just fuckin' start stabbing
Mitchell uncontrollably.

00:15:25.824 --> 00:15:28.994
[laughter]

00:15:28.994 --> 00:15:30.662
This is what I'm thinking.

00:15:30.662 --> 00:15:32.330
I got it planned out in my head.

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.032
I'm dead serious.

00:15:34.032 --> 00:15:37.869
So I come--I'm right there
and, as soon as I fuckin'

00:15:37.869 --> 00:15:43.008
get to where I can see Mitchell,
Allamine and Mustapha

00:15:43.008 --> 00:15:46.878
come around the fuckin'
hallway and say, "Ali!"

00:15:46.878 --> 00:15:52.183
And I turn and look,
and Mitchell sees me

00:15:52.183 --> 00:15:53.685
and slams the gate

00:15:53.685 --> 00:15:55.720
and tells me to put the mattress
down.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.122
He can take his own mattress.

00:15:57.122 --> 00:15:58.523
"Put the mattress down."

00:15:58.523 --> 00:16:02.361
And I'm standing there
lookin' at him.

00:16:02.361 --> 00:16:05.230
Say, "Hey, Mitch."
And he just say,

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:07.832
"Put the mattress down."

00:16:07.832 --> 00:16:11.336
I slid the mattress
off of my shoulder, I say,

00:16:11.336 --> 00:16:13.504
"You have a good day, Mitchell."

00:16:13.504 --> 00:16:17.809
And just the fuckin' terror
in his eyes...

00:16:17.809 --> 00:16:19.544
[laughter]

00:16:19.544 --> 00:16:22.347
And I know he shit on hisself
just a little bit...

00:16:22.347 --> 00:16:23.849
[laughter]

00:16:23.849 --> 00:16:27.753
Was enough for me,
and I just walked away real slow

00:16:27.753 --> 00:16:31.557
and didn't break eye contact
until I got to Allamine.

00:16:37.863 --> 00:16:40.899
[laughter]
