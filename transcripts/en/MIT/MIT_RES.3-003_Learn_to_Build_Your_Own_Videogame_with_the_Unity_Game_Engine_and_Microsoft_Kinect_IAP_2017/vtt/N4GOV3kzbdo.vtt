00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.587
KAYLIN: Woo!

00:00:17.587 --> 00:00:19.170
DARIUS: OK, I'm
Darius [INAUDIBLE]----

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.060
KAYLIN: And I'm Kaylin.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.195
DARIUS: --and our project
was kind of a a mini-RPG,

00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:26.790
I guess, Escape From the Zoo.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.129
Right here's like
an opening cutscene.

00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:31.940
So there's these
cute little animals,

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.820
and they're going to
try and escape the zoo.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.940
KAYLIN: Yeah.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.100
The premise of our
idea was that we

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.420
wanted to have different
animals that you could control

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.470
that each had different ways
of moving with the Kinect,

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.390
and we wanted the ways of
moving to kind of, I guess,

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.420
"connect" with the ways that
the animals themselves move.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.420
So we have the
gecko and the frog,

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.660
who move very differently.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.540
The penguin and the rhino.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.603
So we have four different
types of controls that

00:01:03.603 --> 00:01:04.769
correspond with each animal.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.416
DARIUS: So the
goal of the game--

00:01:11.416 --> 00:01:13.832
it's about to pop up on this
view, it's going to be great.

00:01:13.832 --> 00:01:16.090
I never expected that.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.957
Oh, look, there's keys
the zookeeper just

00:01:18.957 --> 00:01:22.126
hapened to put down.

00:01:22.126 --> 00:01:24.800
So each space is in
a small little zoo.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.760
The keys are just
colored cubes and they

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.280
unlock the respective
color doors,

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.685
and so you have to use
each animal's gimmick

00:01:33.685 --> 00:01:36.620
or special power to get
each of the four keys,

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.982
and then you can escape the zoo.

00:01:39.982 --> 00:01:42.160
So there's like a
frog and everything.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.910
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:01:52.503 --> 00:01:54.127
DARIUS: And this is
like the backstory.

00:01:54.127 --> 00:01:55.032
KAYLIN: Yeah.

00:01:55.032 --> 00:01:56.990
PROFESSOR: So this is
like in Grand Theft Auto.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.276
DARIUS: Yeah, so cutscenes were
really interesting to make.

00:02:00.276 --> 00:02:01.980
I couldn't really
quite figure it out.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.720
We had all these image
files, and so it ended up

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.460
being a raw image with like
25 images attached to it

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.010
and then a script that was
like, every set amount of time,

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.900
switch to the next
image, and it's

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.090
like a giant long piece
of code because it's

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.250
like, if time is greater
than 50, do Image 5.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.250
OK, we're in the game.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.220
I'm already moving
around some penguins.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.690
So, the controls
that are universal

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.630
is if I stick my left hand
up, I'm going to turn left.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.590
AUDIENCE (IN DISBELIEF): No!

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.007
If I use my right hand,
I'm gonna turn right.

00:02:34.007 --> 00:02:36.578
So now, a penguin's
move of walking

00:02:36.578 --> 00:02:39.512
is knocking things over!

00:02:39.512 --> 00:02:42.935
But, it's actually gonna be
a little slow and gimmicky.

00:02:42.935 --> 00:02:43.913
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER].

00:02:47.632 --> 00:02:49.590
DARIUS: So, originally
the idea for the penguin

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.537
was to kind of go like this--

00:02:52.537 --> 00:02:53.495
KAYLIN: It still works!

00:02:53.495 --> 00:02:54.130
DARIUS: It actually
still kind of works,

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.950
which is great because that way
you can kind of like a penguin,

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.818
right?

00:02:59.818 --> 00:03:03.101
However, it kind of got hard
because the shoulders are

00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:04.850
really close to each
other, so in the code

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.510
it would be like,
if one shoulder is

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.634
in front of the other, and
because they were close,

00:03:08.634 --> 00:03:10.190
we switched it to the hands.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.420
So if you can see, I'm
very loose with my hands

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.230
just because it helps
with the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.510
So, you saw that
there's four animals.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.440
So a part of this is going to
be able to switch the animals.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.422
If I could please
switch to a frog--

00:03:23.422 --> 00:03:24.505
KAYLIN: You're now a frog.

00:03:24.505 --> 00:03:25.530
DARIUS: I'm now a frog.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.550
Same general controls
with the left and right.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.794
The frog's special
ability is jumping,

00:03:30.794 --> 00:03:33.470
which we wanted it to be
jump, but the code for that

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.340
was a little bit harder
than I able to do

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.471
because it would have to
take the average of your head

00:03:40.471 --> 00:03:40.970
position.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.252
And then whenever you
had an outlier, you jump.

00:03:43.252 --> 00:03:45.020
So that was a
little bit too much.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.150
So the frog is kind of
like a crawling motion

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.961
where one hand's put
in front of the other.

00:03:50.961 --> 00:03:51.794
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:03:51.794 --> 00:03:53.110
[CHUCKLING]

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.610
AUDIENCE: What is
that [INAUDIBLE]??

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:55.810
KAYLIN: So--

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:56.740
DARIUS: Yeah, doing--

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.489
KAYLIN: Yeah, we--

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.800
DARIUS: --assets.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.520
KAYLIN: So I built
this entire world.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.969
And we also used
sort of terraforming.

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:06.760
One thing I really
wanted, I wanted the zoo

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.065
to be really crappy, like you
need to feel like the animals

00:04:11.065 --> 00:04:12.440
like you want to
get out of here.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.070
So I found the worst
clip art I could possibly

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.840
find of each animal.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.250
And if you notice, the
"Welcome to the Zoo"

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.570
sign is in Comic Sans.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.110
All of these models,
as well, are--

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.200
we found them for
between $5 to $10 each

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.760
on the Unity Asset Store.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.555
And they came fully animated.

00:04:36.555 --> 00:04:38.680
There's actually a lot of
animations we didn't use,

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.040
like the frog and the
penguin can eat things.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.520
Yeah, just make sure he
doesn't jump out of the--

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.884
he can't escape yet.

00:04:46.884 --> 00:04:49.050
DARIUS: Yeah, the game
relies on a lot of the things

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.610
the player shouldn't do,
just on basic morals.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.490
So these fences currently
don't do anything.

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.020
They're not collisions.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.145
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] them?

00:04:57.145 --> 00:05:00.295
DARIUS: Yeah, I didn't get
into the [INAUDIBLE] on them.

00:05:00.295 --> 00:05:02.090
There's a little bit
of find about here

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.700
that just happens with
models and not-flat surfaces.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.690
KAYLIN: You can
also see one thing

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.360
we didn't fix is that
the horse still runs,

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.860
like the horse has
like a controller

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.320
attached to him that makes
him run, but he runs in place.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.814
So whenever you move,
the horse moves.

00:05:17.814 --> 00:05:19.480
I like to think it's
because he secretly

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.315
wants to leave with you, but
he's not brave enough to do it.

00:05:22.315 --> 00:05:23.245
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:23.245 --> 00:05:24.640
AUDIENCE: What's the shadow?

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.570
Yeah.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:26.306
KAYLIN: Sorry?

00:05:26.306 --> 00:05:27.472
AUDIENCE: The grass growing.

00:05:27.472 --> 00:05:29.810
KAYLIN: Yeah, this is grass.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.445
There's a lot of grass,
so it loads slowly.

00:05:32.445 --> 00:05:33.111
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:05:33.111 --> 00:05:34.164
So extremely [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:34.164 --> 00:05:35.010
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so--

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.180
KAYLIN: It's a pretty
big world, actually.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.326
Do you want to switch?

00:05:39.326 --> 00:05:42.352
DARIUS: You mean-- oh, I
can keep going for a bit.

00:05:42.352 --> 00:05:45.184
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:45.725 --> 00:05:46.600
I'm going through it.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.550
It's so--

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.460
KAYLIN: The penguin is
probably the slowest.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.070
DARIUS: Let's talk about-- how
about this motion right here?

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.820
It's pretty fun.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.900
So we knew we wanted
a switching motion,

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.220
but logically, we
didn't want the player

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.144
to be able to just do this and
then like continue going on--

00:06:04.144 --> 00:06:04.810
KAYLIN: Forever.

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:05.650
DARIUS: --forever.

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:12.640
So there has to be
a check where if you

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.390
move using left hand
instead of right once,

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.870
switch the check to left,
and then you can't get back

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.603
into that piece of code.

00:06:19.603 --> 00:06:21.880
But if it's in a
update function,

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.280
and that means that
it ran every frame.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.390
So it was running every
frame, but you could only

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.440
go left or right one frame.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.240
So then you're moving
one frame at a time,

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.030
which was hilariously slow.

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.467
So the solution to that was to--

00:06:36.467 --> 00:06:38.050
KAYLIN: Is it the
invisible wall here?

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.549
DARIUS: Yes.

00:06:38.549 --> 00:06:39.940
I'm going to show that off.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:41.590
So the penguin's
special ability is

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.570
going to be able to
slide down things.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.889
So to keep other animals
from using that ability,

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:48.430
there's a nice little
invisible wall.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.746
So, I'm going to switch
it back to penguin.

00:06:51.746 --> 00:06:53.446
And durdle my way away.

00:06:53.446 --> 00:06:54.420
[CLUNK]

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.688
Useless.

00:06:55.688 --> 00:06:58.682
Oops.

00:06:58.682 --> 00:07:00.483
The penguin does have
a sliding animation,

00:07:00.483 --> 00:07:02.442
but I didn't get to it.

00:07:02.442 --> 00:07:03.358
Can I go back in frog?

00:07:03.358 --> 00:07:05.131
I want to try and jump.

00:07:05.131 --> 00:07:06.880
See if I can shortcut
my way through this.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:07.794
KAYLIN: Oh.

00:07:07.794 --> 00:07:09.627
DARIUS: Oh, no, OK.

00:07:09.627 --> 00:07:12.381
That's unfortunate.

00:07:12.381 --> 00:07:12.880
So, yeah--

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:21.260
There was a counter that
counted how many frames

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.920
you're allowed to stick one
hand in front of the other.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.830
And 30 worked pretty well.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:29.665
It was like-- it
felt kind of natural

00:07:29.665 --> 00:07:31.979
with like a pattern
that you would use

00:07:31.979 --> 00:07:33.520
or a time that you
would use to swim.

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:36.950
Let's see.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:41.680
Other things-- switching between
the animals was interesting.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.180
I originally tried attaching
them all to a single player

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.410
and then having them
move the player object,

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.655
so that way it moved
all four of the models

00:07:52.655 --> 00:07:55.110
whether or not they were
invisible at the same time.

00:07:55.110 --> 00:08:00.390
But that kind of caused a
perpetual motion thing where

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:02.140
one animal would move
the player object,

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.390
but then because it was
attached to the player object,

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:06.180
the player object
would move the animal.

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:08.665
So like, you would hit the
game, and suddenly, the penguin

00:08:08.665 --> 00:08:11.516
starts waltzing off
the playing field.

00:08:11.516 --> 00:08:12.640
I think I'm on flat ground.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.240
Can I switch to rhino, please?

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.220
So rhino's cool.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.043
Didn't come with a collider,
so it's just kind of a box.

00:08:20.043 --> 00:08:22.860
But rhino's way to move
is to charge forward.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:28.970
It's kind of fun because you
kind of go like airplane mode.

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:30.400
So now I'm in the gecko zone.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.800
Can I please be gecko?

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.281
Gecko's ability is
to climb up walls.

00:08:35.281 --> 00:08:36.655
However, due to
time constraints,

00:08:36.655 --> 00:08:38.402
instead of climbing
up walls, we're

00:08:38.402 --> 00:08:40.151
going to use some magic
and just teleport.

00:08:40.151 --> 00:08:41.386
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:41.386 --> 00:08:43.650
Good enough.

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:44.942
He's going to get his key.

00:08:44.942 --> 00:08:47.740
AUDIENCE: Wait, what is that?

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.720
DARIUS: So, would you
like to talk about NPCs?

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.220
KAYLIN: Yes.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.750
So we're going to go visit
some of the NPCs now.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:55.270
There are interacts
that you engage

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:59.020
with by hitting a little
invisible collider box.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.060
There's a gorilla and a
horse, neither of whom

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.800
want to escape with you.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.600
The gorilla's in that
sad-looking cage.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.080
And the horse is
standing behind him.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.680
And each interact is
specific to the animals.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.120
So we're going to interact
with gorilla as rhino.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.328
DARIUS: [? Hup ?] [? feed. ?]

00:09:15.328 --> 00:09:17.925
[CHUCKLING]

00:09:17.925 --> 00:09:19.550
I need a little break,
so this is fine.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:20.091
KAYLIN: Yeah.

00:09:20.091 --> 00:09:21.830
[LAUGHS] It's good exercise.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:23.200
Oh no, he became the horse.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.866
DARIUS: Oh, why did
the horse get there?

00:09:24.866 --> 00:09:26.582
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:26.582 --> 00:09:27.915
That's actually a good question.

00:09:27.915 --> 00:09:31.760
I don't know why the horse
is behind the gorilla.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.070
KAYLIN: It could
actually be the image.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:36.220
Weird.

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.650
We had to make a
Harambe reference.

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:40.030
I mean, it's a gorilla in a zoo.

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:40.420
DARIUS: Yeah.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:41.753
KAYLIN: What are we going to do?

00:09:43.856 --> 00:09:47.566
DARIUS: Another interesting--
talk about cutscenes.

00:09:47.566 --> 00:09:49.660
Cutscenes were fun.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:52.472
KAYLIN: Oh, it automatically
goes to the horse.

00:09:52.472 --> 00:09:54.120
DARIUS: That's unfortunate.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.879
KAYLIN: Well, it's OK.

00:09:55.879 --> 00:09:58.170
DARIUS: So this is like the
interaction with the horse.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:00.410
KAYLIN: But it only did
part of the horse cutscene.

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:02.080
Maybe the images were just
put there by accident.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:02.830
Whatever.

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:04.120
Anyways, so this is the horse.

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:11.235
Yeah, so as we'll find out in a
minute, we're going to leave--

00:10:11.235 --> 00:10:11.735
oh.

00:10:11.735 --> 00:10:12.403
DARIUS: Oh.

00:10:12.403 --> 00:10:12.903
KAYLIN: Wow.

00:10:12.903 --> 00:10:15.290
DARIUS: [INAUDIBLE]
A little shortcut.

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:16.300
KAYLIN: Oh, it must have
still been picking you up.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.716
DARIUS: Yeah, it
was still moving.

00:10:17.716 --> 00:10:19.260
I guess I forgot
to turn off input.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:19.952
That's great.

00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:20.660
KAYLIN: Oh, well.

00:10:22.925 --> 00:10:24.425
So we're going to
go interact with--

00:10:24.425 --> 00:10:25.700
DARIUS: Oh, that's why
it's turning the horse.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.366
KAYLIN: Sure, we'll
switch with penguin.

00:10:27.366 --> 00:10:28.030
Oh, that's why.

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:29.750
Yeah.

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.980
So now we'll go interact.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:33.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:35.304
Shh.

00:10:35.304 --> 00:10:36.470
DARIUS: Frog is pretty good.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:37.630
Can I have frog?

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:40.060
KAYLIN: OK, we'll have frog.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:40.560
There we go.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.268
DARIUS: So interesting
things, it's like,

00:10:42.268 --> 00:10:44.820
ooh, I think I triggered this.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.090
When I was testing,
to get around,

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:49.225
I had to choose different
animals to get around.

00:10:49.225 --> 00:10:54.440
So frog was convenient because
of the jumping was pretty fast.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.200
The rhino's the fastest,
but because the rhino hitbox

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.130
is literally a box,
some weird things

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:02.840
happened where they
would hit a log

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.830
and then start flying
off into space,

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:07.814
or like flip over and
tumble and crazy things.

00:11:07.814 --> 00:11:09.230
So it wasn't really
the safe route

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:14.070
to get to places, but if I was
feeling angry and ambitious--

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:14.750
ooh, weird.

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:15.250
Tilted.

00:11:18.026 --> 00:11:20.442
I would like to go to rhino
and like I have fun pretending

00:11:20.442 --> 00:11:21.650
to be like an airplane.

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:23.066
KAYLIN: It's called
a Dutch angle.

00:11:23.066 --> 00:11:23.740
It's purposeful.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.500
[CHUCKLING]

00:11:26.052 --> 00:11:27.260
DARIUS: This is the last key.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.114
We're almost there.

00:11:29.114 --> 00:11:30.330
KAYLIN: Hold up.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:31.296
Should I switch?

00:11:31.296 --> 00:11:31.962
DARIUS: Not yet.

00:11:31.962 --> 00:11:33.410
I need to line up.

00:11:39.274 --> 00:11:42.105
KAYLIN: Is frog
faster than gecko?

00:11:42.105 --> 00:11:43.480
DARIUS: It's
because of the jump.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.312
AUDIENCE: Showing you over here.

00:11:44.312 --> 00:11:44.811
DARIUS: OK.

00:11:44.811 --> 00:11:47.480
Oop, oop, oop.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:47.980
Rhino?

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:48.479
KAYLIN: OK.

00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:54.295
DARIUS: So the rhino's
special ability

00:11:54.295 --> 00:11:56.690
is being able to
break down boxes.

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:58.982
[ROAR] And then hit the key.

00:11:58.982 --> 00:12:01.700
[INAUDIBLE]

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.195
However, it's a very tight
corridor, so the rhino

00:12:05.195 --> 00:12:06.928
itself can't really
turn to get out.

00:12:06.928 --> 00:12:07.585
KAYLIN: Oh, no.

00:12:07.585 --> 00:12:09.437
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:09.437 --> 00:12:10.228
AUDIENCE: Teamwork.

00:12:10.228 --> 00:12:11.994
KAYLIN: Yeah.

00:12:11.994 --> 00:12:13.827
This sort of-- another
part of the premise--

00:12:13.827 --> 00:12:14.030
DARIUS: Oh, well, no.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:15.613
KAYLIN: --was that
we wanted to make--

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:20.660
we wanted to make the
characters be animals

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:23.690
that nobody would miss if they
left the zoo, except for rhino,

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:24.800
who everybody would miss.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.351
So rhino needs a lot of help.

00:12:26.351 --> 00:12:27.847
[CHUCKLING]

00:12:27.847 --> 00:12:29.180
DARIUS: There's always a reason.

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.040
KAYLIN: That's the plot reason.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.050
DARIUS: So if you
noticed at the beginning,

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:33.930
there were doors near
the entrance here.

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:35.112
They're all gone.

00:12:35.112 --> 00:12:37.695
You know, the colored keys got
rid of their respective colored

00:12:37.695 --> 00:12:38.866
doors.

00:12:38.866 --> 00:12:41.970
And there's a short
ending cutscene.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.740
So I'm going to
make it to the end.

00:12:49.078 --> 00:12:50.042
Welcome to the zoo.

00:12:50.042 --> 00:12:51.488
Goodbye.

00:12:51.488 --> 00:12:52.916
Freedom!

00:12:52.916 --> 00:12:53.416
KAYLIN: Yay.

00:12:53.416 --> 00:12:53.920
DARIUS: Ahh!

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:54.828
AUDIENCE: Yay.

00:12:54.828 --> 00:12:55.824
[CHUCKLING]

00:12:55.824 --> 00:12:59.808
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:02.796 --> 00:13:04.290
PROFESSOR: Are
there any questions?

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:08.282
It was a pretty thorough
talk through the whole thing.

00:13:08.282 --> 00:13:09.490
DARIUS: We had a lot of time.

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:10.390
KAYLIN: Yeah.

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:12.190
PROFESSOR: Any questions?

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:16.090
All right, awesome.

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:17.940
Very cool.
