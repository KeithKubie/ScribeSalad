00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.030
The term for
this is patient-centered care.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.700
This may sound like a strange term, but
the traditional health care system is

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.230
often been designed and optimized around
the needs of providers, not patients.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.200
As a result, care can be inconvenient.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.710
Patients have to wait for
appointments and

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.600
may have to wait even once
they arrive in the clinic.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.182
All of this discourages coming,
particularly for

00:00:25.182 --> 00:00:26.715
routine preventative care.

00:00:26.715 --> 00:00:31.530
Patient-centered care is designed
around the needs of patients

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.910
who may even be able to be seen the same
day they request an appointment.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.110
This care is delivered by a team so

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.190
that routine problems that don't require
a physician can be handled by a nurse or

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.820
other provider, again, on a much
more convenient and timely basis.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.568
A key tenet of patient-centered care
is that all patients should have

00:00:53.568 --> 00:00:55.990
a Primary Care Physician, or PCP.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.048
This is usually a family physician,
general internist or

00:01:01.048 --> 00:01:06.370
OB-GYN for adults and
a pediatrician for children.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.570
Their job includes having
a complete view of a patient and

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.299
coordinating the care delivered by
the team or even other physicians.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.500
In a well-coordinated healthcare system,
every patient has a PCP.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.400
Since they may not have the skills or

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.430
knowledge to manage all of
the problems a patient like Marla has,

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.650
part of the PCP's job is to refer
patients to specialists when needed but

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.999
still to coordinate and
oversee all of their care.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.670
In this last role,

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.920
the PCP is often referred to as
The Gatekeeper, the person who makes

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.280
decisions about when their patients
need expensive specialized care.
