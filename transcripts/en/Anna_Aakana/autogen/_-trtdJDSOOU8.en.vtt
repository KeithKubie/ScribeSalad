00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.320
Today is the photoshoot for my clothing line

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.280
Ghost and Stars.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.100
Pretend we're taking a photo!

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.040
Starting my own clothing line is something that

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.760
I've wanted to do for a really long time.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.360
And I wanted to have a bunch of my friends come out

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.660
and wear my apparal and get avant-garde

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.860
futuristic makeup.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.060
The makeup and hair people are obviously amazing so

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.320
it was fun to just get to feel like another creature for the day.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.640
And everyone has been such a good sport

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.480
and so talented and so beautiful!

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.760
Our photographer and me will just be like

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.560
screaming at people like: You're adorable!

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.020
You're beautiful!

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.080
I'm stoked to be surrounded by so many cool chicks.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.600
Anna picked a lot of lovely women that are both like

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.480
awesome looking and just awesome to hang out with.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.260
I love avant-garde makeup.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.420
So when I started thinking about how I wanted

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.240
to present the clothes, I was like well

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.440
I mean, we can like do avant-garde

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.460
and like make everyone kind of look like aliens

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.880
or like they're from the future

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.620
like really high fashion

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.480
so that when you go the website it doesn't just look like

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.700
oh here's a bunch of like products you can buy

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.380
but it's just a lot of interesting images from a lot of

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.240
different, adorable friends of mine.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.820
"Girl Fight" is what I'm wearing.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.520
I think the shirt is about being strong, powerful.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.140
My little sister is here, she was so excited

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.600
when I told her this was happening

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.000
because she looks up to Anna.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.560
And she wants a shirt.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.440
This is an amazing shirt, it has a

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.240
Catstronaut, I think you said?

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.740
It's a Cat Astronaut and it's basically my goal in life.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.020
This is a first design that I wanted.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.720
and it was actually done by my best friend

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.120
in North Carolina, Jessica Balacy.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.880
I was like, I really want a cat shirt.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.860
I have to have a cat shirt because

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.480
that's kind of why I wanted a clothing line--was

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.620
because I wanted shirts that I could wear all the time.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.660
And so when I said

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.140
Hey can you make me like a cat in space or like a cat astronaut?

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.580
She sent me this and it has become my favorite design

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.640
because I have four cats and I love cats

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.940
and this one is an astronaut.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.220
Oh, the shirt is sweet dude

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.060
I'm so stoked that I own this now.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.300
Plus I love that it's Anna's face on my shirt.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.320
There's like multiple components that are like, great.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.300
It says "Oh My Stars" and the "A" is holding

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.060
all my stars.  Like balloons.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.020
I like kind of busy clothes

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.760
so I can pair it with more busy stuff.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.020
I don't know if you can tell from the pictures

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.460
but it's really soft.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.680
I have the Hallucination shirt.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.360
Uhm, it's just really cute with some little hearts

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.880
going on, so we just did a whole theme where I don't know

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.280
maybe you're hallucinating.  Crazy face.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.440
It is math inspired because I don't think

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.740
any of this is real or correct.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.940
Uhm, I like to call them Cat-culations.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.740
Ah!

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.260
Ghost and Stars was something that I found in my diary

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.200
a long time ago.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.080
I used to just like to write words or phrases

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.020
and so when I was thinking about what to call

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.240
the clothing line, I didn't want it to be "Anna Akana"

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.740
and I didn't want it to be my face

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.100
or like "Stay Awesome Gotham" or anything like that.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.820
I was like no I want to make clothes that I would actually wear

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.740
in real life for any occasion.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.720
I would wear this shirt probably

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.740
like out during the day but you could also like

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.380
tuck it in a pair of skanky hot pants

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.540
and like wear them with some tights and rock it at night.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.860
What I know is that she started this from the ground up.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.440
That she is doing this on her own.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.500
She decided to make this company

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.700
and she's doing it.  It's out of her closet, it's out of her

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.180
house.  Which is insane.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.800
Thank you so much to the crew, thank you so much to the models,

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.240
and thanks for making my dream come true.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.800
And if you'd like a shirt you can get it at GhostandStars.com

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.760
Yay!  Stay Awesome Gotham.
