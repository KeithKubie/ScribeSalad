00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:04.589
 Canada and the United States have the world’s most straightforward and perhaps the most boring border 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.540
 However, if you study it carefully, you will find that they are actually very strange. 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.130
 Although the two sister countries are friendly, they all want to divide the boundaries clearly. 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.349
 In order to figure out who owns which side of North America, they made a 20-foot wide along the border. 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:21.349
 Space, total length 5,500 miles 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.770
 In addition to the unique New England town built before the demarcation of the border or 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.020
 Outside the airport that needs to extend the runway, this space has become a "contactless zone" for two countries. 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.660
 They still take the matter of dividing the boundary very seriously. 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.220
 Although this "no-contact zone" runs through the wilderness of the Alaska/Yukon area for hundreds of miles. 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.370
 Sorry, the trees blocking the border == 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.470
 You may think that the US-Canada border is definitely the longest and straightest logging area in the world. 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.500
 However, this is not the case. Logging area? Correct! The most straight? Big mistake! 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.340
 When you look at the map, it may be straight, and the treaty between the two parties is "speaking" is straight. 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.980
 However, in reality, this officially established border is actually up to 900 apart. 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.020
 Hundreds of feet of "Zigzag" horizontal lines are linked together 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.920
 Where does this come from? Think about North America in the 1800s 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.070
 The latitude 49 degree line has just been formulated as a national border. It is your job to achieve it. 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.450
 They gave you a compass and a rope ball, then called you 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.580
 After delineating three-thirds of North America. Ignore those 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.560
 Unknown wildlife, your responsibility is just to keep this line straight 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.990
 That's right 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.860
 I wish you 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:22.460
 good luck 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.640
 Those surveyors have done their best to build more than 900 national borders. 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.770
 The straightness of these monuments is almost the same as the border you imagined in a year without GPS. 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.780
 But that's not a spherical/planar cross that brings mathematicians joy. 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.159
 Despite this, these borders have been "connected" through contactless areas. 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:39.920
 Determined the border between the two countries 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.560
 Hey, although there are only about 900 national borders here in North America. There is an agreement on the entire US-Canada border. 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.689
 8000 national borders to draft the borders of the two countries 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.090
 Despite the size of the plan, Canada and the United States still have controversy 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.080
 In the dispute between the two countries, there are several Atlantic islands in the United States. 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.710
 It belongs to Maine, and Canada says it belongs to New Brunswick. Canada (assuming the island is her) 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.570
 Just a lighthouse on the island, and the United States (assuming the island is her) 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.450
 Just when the lighthouse is transparent 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.519
 This issue is not important because it is mainly about the problem between the bird watcher and the fisherman who wants to catch the lobster. 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.319
 But still hope that this problem can be 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.049
 Someone solved it before finding the oil under the lighthouse. 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.930
 Even in non-controversial areas, there are still a few strange places. 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.590
 For example, this protruding place is more weird when zoomed in. 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.650
 It does not straddle, but cuts a part of Canada and goes south in the lake. 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.709
 Then go straight south to the north latitude 49 degrees 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.790
 This area is home to about 100 Americans and is also a 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:34.609
 The best example of the birth of irregular borders 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:38.819
 Back in 1783, the victorious Americans were negotiating with the British who controlled British North America (Canada). 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.819
 They need a map, and this is the best map at the time. 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.859
 The east coast is indeed very accurate, but the more you go west, the simpler it is. 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:52.959
 They were negotiating (now Minnesota and Manitoba). Unfortunately, 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.900
 That piece of land is hidden under the map illustration, so those American and British 佬

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.680
 In fact, it is just dividing the gap, (I said really) 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.409
 They guess that the borders between the two countries should start from the northwest of the lake and extend to the west. 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:07.510
 Somewhere until the intersection with the Mississippi River 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.760
 But somewhere, it became nowhere. Because the omnipotent Mississippi River was broken before the cross. 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.139
 So the blank border is left until the second round of negotiations 35 years later. 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:18.980
 Formulated the aforementioned 49 degrees north latitude 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.129
 But there is still a problem. The lake we just mentioned is actually more north than they imagined. 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.939
 More irregular. The northwest point of the lake is here, so the national border needs to jump up. 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:31.159
 Convergence it, then immediately fall straight to 49 degrees north latitude, unnaturally cut a part 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:34.290
 Canada, continue to go west to the rest of the land 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.109
 Summary, you can't draw a straight line of hundreds of miles without 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:39.699
 Make a few troubles 

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:43.809
 Vancouver Island: One of the places that was lucky to save, north latitude 49 

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:47.839
 It should have cut it in half, but both sides agree that it makes no sense. 

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:48.579
 So choose to circumvent 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.709
 But the Roberts point next to Vancouver Island was not discovered at the time, so 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.389
 It is crossed by national borders. This is a very nice town with more than 1000 American citizens. 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:01.609
 But there is only one small country, so the older children need to cross the border four times a day. 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.979
 Go to their own state to go to school 

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:08.299
 On the east coast, on the contrary, on the island of Canada (Ile Campobello) 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.279
 The bridge to the United States is her only departure from the island. 

00:04:11.279 --> 00:04:15.099
 However, these two places are not the only ones. 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.310
 Under satellite photos, you can easily see that there are more places in the contactless area with the same problem. 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.750
 Whether it is uninhabited, the middle of the lake 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:30.750
 It is still a ridiculous place, and the borders of the sister countries of the United States and Canada must remain clear forever.
