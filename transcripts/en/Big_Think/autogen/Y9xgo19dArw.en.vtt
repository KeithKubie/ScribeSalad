of retribution why was it designed by
 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.609
of retribution why was it designed by
natural selection okay I mean now the

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619
natural selection okay I mean now the
 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.580
natural selection okay I mean now the
way you see it play out is you know kind

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590
way you see it play out is you know kind
 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.500
