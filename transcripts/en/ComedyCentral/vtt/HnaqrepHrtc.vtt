&gt; HE''S A LITTLE CRUSTY.

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:16.916 size:78% position:39% line:85%
&gt;&gt; HE'S A LOON, ISN'T HE?

GLOVES ON HIS FEET!

00:00:35.868 --> 00:00:37.603 align:start position:0% line:91%
HE BUTTERS HIS BREAD WITH
VASELINE!

00:00:37.636 --> 00:00:39.172 align:start position:0% line:91%
HE LIVES IN A PINEAPPLE UNDER
THE SEA.

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:41.808 line:91%
IF SALVADOR DALI AND DR. SEUESS

RAISED BY SCHIZOPRHENIC HOWLER

WOMEN WORKERS.

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:04.797 line:91%
WE MUST BE FOCUSED ON CAMPAIGN
FINANCE REFORM... INSTEAD OF

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.702 line:91%
CUTTING SOCIAL SECURITY, WE ARE
GOING TO EXPAND SOCIAL SECURITY

00:01:09.735 --> 00:01:11.070 align:start position:0% line:85%

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:22.548 align:start position:0%
POLITICIAN.

00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:24.717 align:start position:0% line:91%
I MEAN, HE'S EXCITABLE,
CERTAINLY UNPOLISHED, AS

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.887 line:91%
EVIDENCED BY HIS TO DELIVER HIS
INCOME EQUALITY SPEECH IN FRONT 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.423 align:start position:0% line:85%
OF A REGATTA.

00:01:30.456 --> 00:01:31.691 align:start position:0% line:85%
BUT HE'S NOT CRAZY.

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:35.094 line:91%
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SANDERS
AND HILLARY CLINTON, BESIDES THE

00:01:35.127 --> 00:01:37.663 line:91%
FACT SHE HAS HER OWN INTERNET
SERVICE IN HER HOUSE AND HE

00:01:37.696 --> 00:01:40.633 align:start position:0% line:91%
ISN'T SURE HE'S ONLINE UNLESS HE
HEARS THIS --

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:43.503 align:start position:0% line:85%
[MODEM SOUND]

&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT THE REAL DIFFERENCE
IS, HILLARY HAS PROFESSIONAL

00:01:47.973 --> 00:01:49.609 align:start position:0% line:85%
IMAGE HANDLERS...

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:54.213 line:85%
TELLING HER TO COMB HER HAIR --

00:01:54.246 --> 00:01:59.719 align:start position:0% line:91%
TODAY... AND TOMORROW... MAKE
IT A REGULAR THING.

00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:03.189 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND HILLARY INSTEAD OF USING
YOUR ACTUAL VOICE, MAKE IT SOUND

00:02:03.222 --> 00:02:08.561 align:start position:0% line:91%
LIKE YOU'RE FROM WHATEVER REGION
IT IS YOU'RE TALKING TO.

00:02:08.594 --> 00:02:11.097 line:91%
IN FACT, HERE'S THE ILLINOIS-
BORN, NEW ENGLAND-EDUCATED 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.833 align:start position:0% line:91%
SENATOR SPEAKING IN SOUTH

00:02:13.866 --> 00:02:18.437 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I'M AWARE I MAY NOT BE THE
YOUNGEST CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE,

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.674 line:91%
BUT I HAVE ONE BIG ADVANTAGE, I
HAVE BEEN COLORING MY HAIR FOR

00:02:21.707 --> 00:02:23.843 align:start position:0% line:85%
YEARS!

00:02:23.876 --> 00:02:29.282 align:start position:0% line:85%
(LAUGHTER)

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:32.718 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: NOW ANYWAY, IF Y'ALL
EXCUSE ME, I HAVE TO GET 

00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:33.853 align:start position:0% line:85%
SHELL BY'S JUICE!

00:02:33.886 --> 00:02:37.590 align:start position:0% line:85%
SHE'S HAVING A FIT!

00:02:37.623 --> 00:02:39.992 align:start position:0% line:91%

TOMATOES!

00:02:40.025 --> 00:02:42.228 line:91%
LISTEN UP, SENATOR, I'LL DO THE
LINDSAY LOHAN IMPRESSIONS AROUND

00:02:42.261 --> 00:02:44.564 size:81% position:41% line:85%
HERE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:51.137 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S ALL WE'VE BECOME SO
ACCUSTOMED TO STAGE MANAGED,

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.941 size:88% position:44% line:91%
FOCUS-DRIVEN CANDIDATES THAT
AUTHENTICITY COMES ACROSS AS

00:02:54.974 --> 00:02:56.242 align:start position:0% line:85%
LUNACY.

00:02:56.275 --> 00:02:59.812 line:91%
&gt;&gt; HE MAY BE THE MOST UNUSUAL
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WE'VE

00:02:59.845 --> 00:03:01.214 align:start position:0% line:85%
SEEN IN A LONG TIME.

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:04.584 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: IF BY UNUSUAL YOU MEAN
HONESTLY REPRESENTING HIMSELF IN

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:07.720 line:91%
HIS BELIEFS RATHER THAN PLAYING
A CYNICAL POLITICAL GAME, BUT IF

00:03:07.753 --> 00:03:12.458 line:91%
YOU MEAN MOST UNUSUAL CANDIDATE
AS IN CRAZY, I CAN REFUTE THAT

00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:16.562 align:start position:0% line:91%
ASSERTION IN THREE SIMPLE
WORDS --

00:03:16.595 --> 00:03:18.231 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; AHHH!

00:03:18.264 --> 00:03:20.900 align:start position:0% line:85%
SHUCKY DUCKY!

00:03:20.933 --> 00:03:22.799 size:88% position:44% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: SHUCKY DUCKY INDEED.
