Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number one 79 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening. So the Spear Danes in days gone by and the kings who ruled them had courage and greatness.

Speaker 2:          00:00:21       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:00:21       we have heard of those princes heroic campaigns.

Speaker 2:          00:00:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:26       There was shield Sheaf, sin scourge of many tribes, a wrecker of mead benches, rampaging among foes. This terror of the haul troops had come far a foundling to start with. He would flourish later on as his powers waxed and his worth was proved in the end. Each clan on outlying coasts beyond the whale road had to yield to him and begin to pay tribute.

Speaker 2:          00:01:03       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:01:03       that was one good king boom opening with a little bit of Beowulf. And that is the opening of Beowulf translated by Shamus Haney.

Speaker 2:          00:01:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:20       And what I notice is even back in the day in the opening of the, the original old English poem, the first one written, what are they talking about? They're talking about war and they're talking about leadership.

Speaker 2:          00:01:37       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:39       And you can hear it in the beginning. He was a little bit of a weak leader. He was a foundling to start with, but he would flourish later on. Became a good king.

Speaker 2:          00:01:48       No,

Speaker 1:          00:01:50       and that's what happens. You learn, you get better. And that is why we talk about war and leadership here. And speaking of war and leadership back for a third time, my brother Jason Gardener, retired master chief who I've known since I got into the James' in the early nineties he's been on the podcast before. So if you haven't listened to one 67 in one 68 go listen to those first. There's a lot of ground covered in those podcasts and I told him to listen in and listen to him again and see which what we missed so we could go back and that's, we're going to do now cover some more ground, hit some of that stuff that we missed. So welcome back Jason. Thank you. Check. There's I, when I first got that translation, which was actually when I was in college and it starts off with, so I just said, oh my God, this is totally legit. So I start things with so a lot now when I write, I do that. I do that. So yeah, welcome back. How's retirement treating you? Good

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       to go. I was going to say awesome, but I'd be awesome. Absolutely to death in the last two podcasts.

Speaker 1:          00:03:06       So I'm going to try and ban it into your life. Is your southern California childhood creep out with some awesome? Yes. Everything is awesome. Yup. Yeah. So you got to watch out for that. So what do we miss? I know we missed something from your youth. What were you talking about the best, the best show you ever saw? The best punk rock show you ever saw? Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:03:25       there was one that, and this is before I could even drive buddy of mine, Justin Hawkins and Alicia went up to this, this Gig at Cypress College and was DUI plain rap, the Dickies, the vandals, the circle jerks. And there might've been one other band for $7 in presale. Yeah. So we got presale tickets. We went up there, got in there was probably about 500 people outside who weren't able to get in because it's sold out. So they just went ahead and knocked the doors down and all flooded in. So what that meant was nobody got searched coming in for security and people had crazy stuff like firecrackers. It was way overcrowded for, you know what the safe, safe amount for the building was. So when you went up by where the doors were, the security guys had just put, pushed all these tables and chairs and we're sitting on them up against the doors to keep anybody else from coming in. And the, the show is just unreal. There were three mosh pits and then when the circle jerks came out, they opened up with wild on the streets. The whole floor exploded. One, the pits started floating, crashed into another pit.

Speaker 1:          00:04:47       We're throwing bricks of firecrackers around. It was mass pandemonium was so much. And so you were like 14 or 1515 years old. Yeah. My mom had dropped me off, dropped us off there. Oh that's awesome. Good for your mom. Oh yeah, she's got the squared away, man, that's squared away because a lot of times you pay if your parents, if parents try and shield their kids from that or they won't let them go, then you would have just snuck out. They would have never known where you were Yep. And gotten in trouble and you had rebelled against it. Right? Yeah. Cause that's what happens if you're, if you're, if your parents trying to control you too much, it's kind of like with any person, right. You try and control them too much, then they get out of control. They rebel against you. Right. When was this discussion?

Speaker 1:          00:05:31       I think I was having the other day with a um, your daughter about people just trying to box people in and it's another example of just over centralized command and yes, it is too much, too much stuff like that. They're just going to go the other way. I was actually, I was talking about this with a leader in a company and I was explaining because you like for sure money drives people, compensation drives people. But ability to choose your fate or some influence over your fate is, is a also very powerful motivator and incentive for people to follow. So when you have a look, like if you have one job where you make more money but you don't have any freedom and you don't have any control over your own fate versus a job where you get paid less money, but you have really a lot of autonomy.

Speaker 1:          00:06:15       Most people will go with the autonomy. There are rare people that don't want any autonomy. They just pretty much want to get told, hey, give me my paycheck. I'll do whatever you tell me to do, and that's fine. And that they're not into their job, but, but a lot of people, the more autonomy you give them, the more intuit they are, the more they enjoy what they're doing. Whereas if you're just micromanaging them or a centralized command scenario, they're not intuit and that's a problem at the first person you gave the example, I'd probably exercises. No initiative whatsoever. Exactly. Exactly. You know, you have to address that. You have to address that when we're working with the companies that there are people that they just want to get their paycheck, they're going to punch the clock at four 59 every day. And that's the way it is.

Speaker 1:          00:06:54       They don't want to get promoted. They're fine with that. And so you've got to know, and you know, my answer to those people always is, Oh, if you're leading someone like that, okay, you know what? You've got to get the most out of them. Take good care of them, and they'll do their job well and you know, you can count on them for that. So that's fine. There's nothing wrong with that. It's just that somebody that does have higher goals or different goals, I guess where they want to break out of that, then you've got to give them the opportunity. And those people, if you box them in, they're going to rebel against, you've got to look out, there'll be like Jason Gardener, age 15 with a Mohawk check check. So I know one of the other things that you wanted to talk about a little bit was a was Scotty words.

Speaker 3:          00:07:36       That's right. You know, and just common after, right after Memorial Day, it's really fitting to discuss him. Scotty was a good friend of mine. Um, just a fantastic team guy. He did a, he did six years in the teams and then separated in 2005 and he did, what a lot of guys did at the time was he started contracting overseas because he wanted to be at that point of friction. And for Scotty, I don't think he was ever, ever happier than, than when he was at that point of friction. So he did a bunch of contracting. He wound up getting hired by the defense intelligence agency as a, as a GS position, a full time position. And then January, uh, this last January, he was killed by a suicide bomber when he was out operating in Syria. And I remember when I got the text message, we were all in a group text that, that he'd passed.

Speaker 3:          00:08:34       And I just, man, it kind of floored me for a second. But then, you know, it's like Scotty died doing what he loved and he was just such, he was a maniac in the best sense of the word. Like the hardest I've ever laughed in my life is with him. And, and most people will tell you that anytime they've had a good belly laugh or something, he, you know, it was with Scotty and he had that kind of contagious smile where you look at pictures and Seth is a lot like this. When I look at sets pictures, he's got that smile that just has that special thing about it that automatically makes you use smile. Then you know, you are not ever going to be the voice of reason and you are always going to be a good time and you're a good friend. And so while there's, there's remorse that he's not here anymore, I'm so fired up that I got to spend the time with him that I did.

Speaker 3:          00:09:35       And uh, so anyway, I mean there you really have it. He passed, he's from St Louis, so they had a big funeral form there and it was at this Catholic Cathedral. There had to be a thousand people inside that cathedral and it was raining the day they had it. So the funeral procession from the cathedral to the military sent a cemetery where they buried him. I had to be like at least 30 miles every Stingel overpass on the freeway, on the drive there had fire trucks and first responders out on it, the freeway, they shut the freeway down. Every exit was stopped by police officers, which is, which is pretty pretty Dang cool. Okay. That's all. So then when we got off the freeway and we were driving on the surface streets,

Speaker 2:          00:10:31       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:10:33       People, the people of St Louis just pulled their cars over and they were standing at attention out in the rain. And so it's, it's moving when someone in uniform does that, but you almost kind of expect that out of them. But when you see like a 30 year old mother of two and her two like eight year old kid and seven year old kid standing at attention with their hands in the heart, over their hearts in the rain and it was a cold rain as as he went by. It's just,

Speaker 2:          00:11:06       yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:11:07       it's an, it's an amazing and humbling experience to, uh, to see that kind of love and respect by the people of this country and the people at St Louis.

Speaker 1:          00:11:19       Yeah, that's, that's awesome. I, well, I was at with, with Chris Kyle's per session going down to where he was buried and that was a long drive. I want to say it was a few hours in the entire thing. And again, it was raining. Same thing. We're in Texas, but it's raining. And sure enough, I mean there was, people were aligned the entire way and I was riding with one other guy and it was just in, and we were in this massive, there was a massive procession of people, but it was just, I remember sitting there for a long time and it just, the windshield wipers just going back and forth. We were not talking because there's nothing to say. You can't, you can't put words to that, you know, you can't put words to thousands of people standing out in the rain with their hands on their hearts. Just every bridge, fire trucks, flags hung up from the ladders extended. Yeah. This, uh, the same, same type of feeling that I had one when I was doing that. And it definitely makes you realize that regardless of all the, what do they say these days, that America is division all this division that everyone talks about, there's plenty of people that, that understand what, what it takes to keep this country free. For sure.

Speaker 3:          00:12:37       Absolutely. I feel like it's such a small and maybe vocal minority that's out there and I don't think it's on a whole, I think we're, we're on even though a lot of us have our differences and I think we're figuring out how to discuss politics just by looking at how people discuss stuff on social media and people were dialing it in and there they're able to have realistic discussions with each other without getting too hateful. And there are some people that are still figuring that out.

Speaker 1:          00:13:12       Yeah, for sure. I'll say two things about that. I was on, I was on Ben Shapiro's podcast and you know, Ben was like, and Ben's a real nice guy. He's, you know, very nice to me and, and all that. And he's, you know, he's, what's pretty cool about him is he's, he's like got this running list of everything that he said that's stupid or wrong or whatever, you know, his mea culpa list. But anyways, yes, we were having this conversation. He was hinting at the fact of this massive division and you know, these massive, right against a massive left and, and you know, I said, listen man, I traveled our whole country all the time. I work with construction companies, with finance companies, with now you do to insurance companies. I mean, we meet people from every different industry. I said, these people aren't on the extreme, right?

Speaker 1:          00:14:04       They're not on the extreme left. Their common sense. They're Americans. And I said, you Ben, your, you're like here at, at, at ground zero for political like mayhem. And so what do you expect to see? Like you're, you're the, you're the lightning rod for a lot of this stuff. And so that's what you hear normal America in really liked that. You know, it's just not, it's just not, I'm out there all the time. You're out there all the time now, you know, you see it, no one's coming up to you saying, you know, with some extreme views, are there small number of people? Sure. On both sides, yes, absolutely. But in general people are realizing, oh well that's not a bad point. And then I was on Brian Complement's podcast and we were talking about the same thing. And what's interesting is, you know, um, Ben Shapiro's pretty pretty far on the right and, and Brian Complement is pretty far on the left and me, I think they're both really nice guys that are super cool.

Speaker 1:          00:14:59       And, but what I said to him was, you know, w w what you're saying, what I believe is leading to the attitude kind of shifting is basically this. If you're not humble and you think you know everything, then why should I listen to anything that you say, you know, why should, if I'm on the far left, why should I listen to anything? I know everything and everyone on the right is wrong if I'm on the far right. Why should I listen to anyone that anyone say anything that anyone is saying on the other side, I know everything. If you're humble and you say, you know what, I've got some ideas, but I'm probably not 100% right. You'll maybe I'm only 98% right? No. If you just look at other people and say, Oh, you know what, I probably don't have the full solution for this. Maybe I should listen to other people's opinions and try and try and come up with a a more broad based idea than just what I think. So I think people are starting to realize if you take one extreme view and you don't listen to anyone else, then you're wrong. And so I think people are becoming a little bit more balanced. I certainly hope I, yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:16:05       and, and I know that, that I've got some really, really close friends that are on both ends of the spectrum. How do I sit down with them and have a logical conversation with them? I find out that our values,

Speaker 1:          00:16:20       yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:16:20       Are the same. They're the same. Yeah. And really it's just a lot of misrepresentation. And some unfortunate semantic sometimes that uh, you know, drawing us to different directions or put us on different sides

Speaker 1:          00:16:37       and you know, that's it. Speaking of the left hand and the right hand know this is, you got to tell this story about, and this is, this is a good revealing story about, I've, I, I allude to oftentimes the dark sense of humor in the teams and there's a dark sense of humor in the military and you kind of have to have a dark sense of humor. And I think, did you see the movie range 15? No. Oh, okay. It's, it's about, it's just a crazy movie that Tim Kennedy and, and, and Matt best and the black rifle coffee company. Yeah. Like all those guys, they throw the keys to the girl. Yeah. Yeah. It's just, it's just every horrible dark joke that you can make they make. And I don't know how well it did or whatever. It did good enough. It did good enough. I mean, I'm sure it offended a lot of people. I'm sure it offended a lot of people, but they did it so good for good on them. But you know, you talk about that, that kind of dark sense of humor. And I think this story which you like called me, I don't know, whatever it was six months ago or whatever you go to, I got to tell you a story,

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       which whenever you call me and tell me that I get super excited. I tell my kids to leave the room and I'd like to put you on speaker phone and I put you on speakerphone and then I mute. So I don't interrupt you by laughing so hard because whenever you call me and tell me you got a good story. I'm thinking, here we go. So yeah, tell us about the hand. So, and, and I talked to Aaron Kendall this morning to make sure I got the details correct. So Aaron Kendall's a seal that was working at the training detachment when I was the command master chief there and he is on a hunting trip out in Texas, like a foundation supported hunting trip. And he's driving one of those side-by-sides out to where he's going to hunt like side by side ATV, like an ATV tribe. Like one of those razors.

Speaker 3:          00:18:36       Right. And it rolls and it's smack. The rollbar smashes his left arm. So he makes a tourniquet out of his belt and walks like a mile back to the range house and then they call a, they tried to call lifelight lifelight can't come out. It's too foggy. They get an ambulance comes and gets him. They start driving him up towards a, to a hospital at San Antonio. Now he's in the hospital. They wind up having to amputate his left hand in the hospital in this first hospital. Why is that? Because it was just completely smell was so smashed that every, his arm was just smashed. It was done. He was losing so much blood through there and they ended up like, they kind of had to fight to save the amputation below his elbow cause they were worried that because later on in surgeries they're taking more and more.

Speaker 3:          00:19:31       So there were a couple of other team guys that were there and other team guys flew in to help out. And they're staying at this hotel right outside the hospital where he's at. So they take him from where he was, they take them to this hospital, this hospital, and at that hospital they have to amputate his hand. So he's bedside talking with the other, with some other seals. And they're the surgeon who amputate his hand is in there checking on him and they asked the surgeon, hey, do you guys still have his hand? And the surgeon says, yeah, I think so. I don't, you know, we haven't destroyed. And they asked him, what are you going to do with it? And he goes, well, you know, I guess they destroy it or whatever. And so Aaron asked, well, can I have my hand? And the surgeon says, I'll go check.

Speaker 3:          00:20:19       So he goes and checks with the administrators, right? And they come back and they say, yeah, you have to fill out these forms, but we'll give you the hand. So they fill out the forms, they give the hand to. Um, one of the other seals actually receives a hand cause Aaron now has, has had to move to a different hospital that's a little bit better to deal with the amputations and, and they've got his hand with the intent to take it to a taxidermist. So in the meantime, they're keeping it in the freezer of the hotel

Speaker 2:          00:20:51       and

Speaker 3:          00:20:54       they're taking turns spending time with Aaron. So guy will be there at the hospital with Aaron, Wally's in the other hospital and other guys at the hotel and they're flipping back and forth, which is a little testament to like, well, the way it is for team guys are just looking out for [inaudible] take care of you. Like you're in the hospital, want someone's gonna stay with you 24 hours a day. It's awesome. Right? So one of the guys that's back at the hotel room decides that either he's got to go somewhere and he wants to put the hand in the other guy's freezer or he's gonna play a joke on one of the other guys and put the hand in his bed.

Speaker 3:          00:21:28       And so he comes up with these different Roos to try and get the hotel staff to let him into the room and they're not having any of it because he looks kind of shady or mean. He's a team guy. So he, so he's telling him, Oh hey, you know my friend left his phone in the room, can I get in there? And they're like, well no. Or Hey, well no, actually it wasn't his phone. It was his ID ready to go. Like all that stuff that, that come, they're shutting him down cause he looks like a criminal. Yes. So then he leaves to go to the hospital I guess. But they're suspect. They're suspect the poor may goes in there and finds a hand in the freezer.

Speaker 3:          00:22:05       I have a picture of it. It's horrible. It's all gray and just like ripped off right there. So Adam's family style? Yes. And so they of course call the police. The police show up and they just detain every course of course. And then Aaron's in the hospital and all the nurses come up and they're like, hey, all these police are calling here. They need to talk to you, something about your hand. So he's got to get on the phone and explained to the police why his hand is in the thing. I think they probably validated something with the doctor too and you know, calm him down that this wasn't some kind of murder and a

Speaker 2:          00:22:47       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:22:48       Then they kind of settled everything. They threw everybody out of the motel. Aaron gave his hand to the taxidermist. He had a nice, what they call European Mt. Where the tax and dermis and Texas is awesome. So they, they mounted like the skeleton hand is in this really cool mountain inside glass all done up for him. And uh,

Speaker 3:          00:23:10       Aaron just had, he had the best sense of humor about the whole thing, you know, if you're going to get depressed, I mean losing a limb is, it is a pretty good way to do it, you know, and in a lot of ways he's like some of the stuff you see out of guys like, you know, Travis mills where it's just funny, you're not guys like that. You're, you're not going to bum them out. Just going to keep them going. But yeah, hysterical. So then that's obviously one of the many stories. How does that translate to like when you're dealing with your,

Speaker 1:          00:23:45       with your family? Like, so for instance, my wife, when I, when I had to go to college, I had to go to the nurse San Diego and he says my first time in my adult life that I wasn't like in a platoon. And so I was, I didn't really think about it, but all of a sudden I didn't have anyone to like attack verbally all day. Cause when you're a seal platoon, it's just constant, you know, attack and combat, verbal combat, sometimes physical combat. And so when I would come home from school, of course there's my wife and I want to have some verbal sparring matches. So I start hacking away at her, you know, and finally, after three months, she goes, she goes, she goes, she's a bright, you know, she, she says, Hey, I'm not a team guy. You know? And when she said that to me, I instantly, I instantly realized exactly what she was talking about. And I knew she was 100% right. I can't treat my wife as if she's an e five and a seal, you know? And

Speaker 3:          00:24:43       especially like the weapons cleaning table when we're all stuck there cleaning weapons is when guys would just, that's when the, you would look for weaknesses in any spot in any guy and just start, pick, pick, picking, waiting for the reaction.

Speaker 1:          00:24:55       Yeah. You spend so much time with people and so much time just waiting, you know, it's a hurry up and wait thing. So, oh, what do you want to do on, on a four hour fan ride? We're going to destroy someone, get into a fight, spilled Cheetos everywhere, you know, just like total chaos and mayhem. But yeah, it's all about that. But that, but I guess what I'm asking is, I know, you know, Iris obviously had to get a, what's the word, indoctrinated into the life of [inaudible] cause you know, I met my wife when I was pretty young and you were not that young. No. And so you, you know, you, how'd that work out? Like the ideal wife, the, I don't wanna say ideal on a throw that on you pour iris, listen to this. But the squared away, let's say that just squared away spouse was that look like it. So I gotta go back to,

Speaker 3:          00:25:52       if you look at my career and you know this because you said this to her, when did you on the podcast, like she used the best thing that ever happened to me because she's completely squared away and it's because she's so solid and independent. And so there was never, ever any aspect of me having to worry about the homefront and there is a constant, she's like very dialed in and challenges me. Like a lot of my, I had a lot of like pretty far right political views. And then when we sit down and have discussions and stuff, she's really opened my aperture up on that. But you know, you look at her history where she, uh, she worked on ranches where she was only female wrangler with a whole bunch of cowboys. So she, she got it. She had that aspect of what it's, what it's like to be around. And then around guys and then when I'd be messing with her like that, you know, she just, same deal as Helen, let me know. Just put you in check basically. Yeah. And the,

Speaker 2:          00:27:04       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:27:06       You know, this, this job that we have where we're constantly going forward in harm's way and they're there. I chose my words kind of part a poorly on the last podcast when I was talking about her, I said that she put up with a lot of stuff that other women wouldn't. It meant that that gives the indication that she tolerated a lot of shenanigans negative. She was the strength that she had to have to be home while I was on combat deployments and then deal with me when I came back. That strength.

Speaker 2:          00:27:42       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:27:42       Most, most women just can't deal with that kind of lifestyle.

Speaker 2:          00:27:47       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:27:48       And don't have that kind of, what were the words that you used on the last podcast she put up with? A lot of times I said, and so that, that was a really poor choice of words because it indicates like she was just a pushover and she is an absolutely not a pushover. Yeah. It's

Speaker 1:          00:28:04       more like she had the strength to contend with the, the, the hard life that it is exactly like being married to some guy that's going on constant deployment and isn't around a lot. And then when they're gone by the way they might die, they might come back horribly wounded, whatever. And you sign up for that as well.

Speaker 3:          00:28:24       And she's working long hours and raising two little kids. Well, I'm going on six month deployments.

Speaker 2:          00:28:32       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:28:32       Yeah. And then she's, she also

Speaker 2:          00:28:37       like in, in

Speaker 3:          00:28:39       I pretty much, I stayed in contact with her pretty often. So we, we pretty much talked at least three times a week, three times a week on deployment. And uh, um, and that's the model that worked for us.

Speaker 1:          00:28:55       I've described it and I forget who I described, it tears emotional independence like my wife had, has and had enough emotional independence that she was just going to run the show. If I'm not there, not freaking out, you know. And I think that's, if you're going to look for a good spouse, they gotta be, you can't be, they can't be codependent. Right. Cota band is actually actually like a bad thing. Right? I mean that's an an actual bad thing, right? Codependency. Yeah. So, yeah. So, but if you go to the other end of the spectrum or not, maybe, I don't know, maybe there's, I guess if you go too far on that spectrum, then you get to where, hey, I don't even, Oh, you're gone. I didn't, I wasn't aware of that. Sorry, I'm over here doing my own thing. Is there you, but you've got to find a good strong balance.

Speaker 1:          00:29:37       Probably leaning towards independent, in my opinion, you've got to be leaning Independent. Cause if you're not leaning towards independent, I mean when you don't get the, you know, it sucks being here by yourself for six months. It's not a true partnership. If, if, if they're not equal, right. If you're kind of not equal footing and one person really needs the other one, um, then then the partnership at ship aspect of it is it's not there. Yeah. That's uh, that's something to pay attention to. Cause the thing that's kind of weird is when you're young guys get suckered into the being, ha, it's, it feels all empowering to have someone that's all dependent on you. You see what I'm saying? When you're young and you've got the Carl and she's all dependent on you and the world revolves around you, and then when you're not there, she's falling apart and you feel, oh yeah, I'm the man. And so it's easy. I think that I've seen that happen a lot where guys get suckered into those situations and that's not a good situation to get. It never works out because then they're like, well,

Speaker 3:          00:30:47       and then she's in a situation, if it's that kind of girl, she's going to find someone else to take care of her while you're not there to take care of her. Um, and then the case with IRS is like, we're inside the same box as far as, uh, just the things that we enjoy, where we want to be in the outdoors. It's, it's all the same thing. So, you know, it's like I said in my retirement ceremony, when I look, look, I look at the trajectory of my career and then when IRS and I became together, I went from platoon chief to master chief first time up every time and just hammered it because she was a good partner and she drove me to be better and is always driving me to be better.

Speaker 1:          00:31:34       It helps to have somebody that's super squared away like that. You know what that does? It forces you like you're not dude's doing it for yourself because it's easy. It's sometimes easier to let yourself down, right? It's easier to let yourself down than to let down this person that's, that's looking at you thinking, Hey, you could do better than that. Come on. Are you serious right now? And that's the kind of stuff that you'll say to me. You know, she's very straight forward and I'll be cold.

Speaker 3:          00:31:58       I'll just say check. Got It. And then we, we've gotten to the point where we can give each other pretty honest feedback without there being any resentment

Speaker 1:          00:32:10       involved. I've been pretty straightforward with iris on some things. We're working on some projects together and it's pretty cool for me to be able to just be real straightforward with her, you know? And she's like, no, tell me. We'll actually know how to, she says it. She says no, go ahead and tell me. Yup. Jack. So you know, speaking of Afghanistan, um, your, you, you, you, you did the last time you on, you know, we breezed through Afghanistan pretty quick. We did. But that was actually, uh, a really, um, pretty big deployment in terms of what you guys did there. Yup. And I know there were some details that you wanted to get into on some of those operations and some of the things that you brought home from those operations, lessons learned, et Cetera. I mean, you were talking about one earlier talking about the mall deuce and bringing them all deuce. That's it. That's it. That's a good piece of gear to bring out on an operation.

Speaker 3:          00:33:13       Yeah. And usually you got it marked on, mounted on top of a truck. But uh, um, when we did that, that operation, uh, as frag o six and a CJ engine and we actually went into Marsha and the element that I was with was in a blocking position that was looking down a road that ran east west and we were the furthest east position so we were locked in position on, on that direction. And where we got dropped off was really close to where we were going to stay for four days. So we were, you know, we brought him mortar and we brought the, the m to HB heavy barrel, 50 cal machine gun with the big a tripod for it and everything. How'd you break that up? How many guys would carry that? That's a lot of weight to carry, man. You talked to Tim about the ammunition and the weapon and the tripod.

Speaker 3:          00:34:07       Well, they ammunition got pair dropped into us, but the initially, the initial insert, we had an eight ATV on the helicopter and a lot of that stuff was loaded on the ATV. Plus we were inserted maybe 200 yards from the position, so everything was kicked out of the Hilo got staged. We went and cleared the building and then hauled everything over there and set it up and we'd done all the, you know, the imagery set up for, okay, here's what we're going to be, here's where our firing liens, all that. All that stuff was pretty much set up ahead of time. Once you guys were doing that. We started the guys and trade at that. We were putting through training, started doing it, started carrying them in. There was some big team guy, oh he just got back from deployment. I know exactly who you carry the 50 cow.

Speaker 3:          00:34:52       Like he looked like he was carrying a 60 he did and it was a legit good to watch. His nickname was pig nips. His nickname was picnic and he's a beast. I know he's listening. Good on Ya. That's one of the, one of my favorite nicknames. You don't want to have some feature about you that gets noticed in the days cause everyone's gonna call you by some weird day. And the funny thing about him is he is super, he's a big guy and he's super intelligent, just good good guy everywhere you measure it. So we set this thing up in a window in, you know, inside. So just the barrel was sticking out and uh, of the compound that we were holding aiming right down the east West road, cause our, our biggest fear is a, a vehicle born IED coming down that road. And along across that road there was this, there was like a hedge row and there was a little irrigation ditch over there.

Speaker 3:          00:35:52       And so the Taliban kept coming down that hedge row and firing at us from the trees and then just put that 50 on the tree line, stitch it like at Shin level because that would be Chester, a little bit high level for somebody in the ditch and just send up belt all the way down and back and then push them back further. Well at one point some guys had come up from a different direction and they were getting really, really close in this treeline, bad guys, bad guys, Taliban guys. And we could not traverse the gun over far enough. So we tried to shove it out the window, it wouldn't go out the window. So me and a EOD warn officer who was with us, and then, uh, one of my [inaudible] who right now he's a, a troop SCA over at one in the seal teams drug lifting out and put it in the street and just started laying it down.

Speaker 3:          00:36:54       So he got the 50 cows set up in the street right out in front of our compound. And for a second there we were taking heavy fire, pretty heavy fire, PKM fired, but it was all going a little bit high and we just kept stitching, stitching, stitching, and then they were done. They broke contact. They didn't not like that big gun. In fact, the next day it kind of slowed down for us because they didn't want to come, you know, they did. They're like, ah, we'll find a different direction. Because we were holding, you know, basically four square blocks. So they started penetrating in from, from different directions. Uh, the later on, two days later, guys pushed out to another building that was about a hundred yards in front of the position and they got into a little tick up there. So we started lighting up the area that we thought they were taking fire from. And the 50, cal was so loud that they thought that they were taking direct fire from the 50 cow when we were shooting.

Speaker 1:          00:37:57       So the rounds passing by them and the rounds passing by them are so loud and knocking dust off the wall. That's why I was saying I can't even imagine what it would be like to be in a building in, you know, that one situation that Tony was in where there's so much light and you're building up with several hundred rounds? No, the, the brew blue situation, those guys put a 150 rounds into 150 rounds and 50 cal from Todd or no, 20 meters away. I mean from the corner. It was a building on the corner and they stopped in the corner and just shot. And those guys coming out of that building after we got the thing under control, I mean I kicked open the door, I saw Tony there and and then, but and Tony looked pretty much just like normal Tony. Yeah. Everyone else in that building look like they just saw death and they actually just did see death.

Speaker 1:          00:38:44       I mean they're in a building, they get 150 rounds of 50 cal. The guy that was on the roof, he was, he, he was telling me, he would tell me this like a year ago like we were just talking about and he goes, he goes, yeah, I got out my pistol. I 100% thought that we were going to get over Ron and I was going to die if I didn't just take around through the concrete into my head. Right. Yeah. So did they know it was blue and blue or they think that I'm just getting hammered by, well one of the, one of the, one of the many little like components of this. So that guy, the guy that was on the rooftop that I was talking to [inaudible] 12 hours before he was in another position and he got lit up with a disco, a 12.7 millimeter, you know, weapon, which is the Soviet equipment of a 50 cal.

Speaker 1:          00:39:30       For those of you that don't know, he got lit up with that and hit with RPGs. So he said, I remember him as soon as you know, as soon as this was all over, we got back to base. He, he, that's another thing he told me, but he told me this way back then. He said, he said to himself, I can't believe the guy with the dish guy found me again. He was so, he was so, and we were only, you know, a couple of days deployed and that same guy. So when he got lit up, he was in, he was in, he was on Camp Corregidor in an Overwatch position looking for ID and places. He's sitting there on his sniper rifle and all of a sudden he starts taking machine gunfire and it's a dish cup. And then he gets hit with a couple RPGs. Well I'm inside with the company commander from, from the, from one of the companies from the first and five oh six.

Speaker 1:          00:40:19       And we were planning an operation that we're doing the next day. So we start hearing gunfire and all of a sudden we hear RPGs, boom, boom. And I said to him, the machine gun fire starts. And he goes, oh listen. I was like, where a contact. And I go, hey, my snipers are up there. Don't worry about it. Like just Jocko the bad-ass, right. And all of a sudden boom, boom. So we hear the RPG set. So we go running outside and um, I'm still just, I say, hey, don't worry, my guy's got this end. Right. As those words are coming out of the bottom of the sniper tower, cause we, we were right next to it, out of the bottom of the sniper towel out pores. That guy who I'm sure will be on the podcast one day he comes pouring out of the tower, his, his weapon, his sniper gun had been blown like the stock up blown off bro by the RPG.

Speaker 1:          00:41:09       And He's, he just looks like, oh my God. You know what I said? Okay, well maybe not. It was horrible. But so that's the guy when they're getting, when they're getting shot up with 50 cal. Yeah. He just thought, and the rest of the guys do, cause everyone knew that this had happened. Know we briefed it. Hey, hey, just imagine the PLO going out to this. I'm saying, hey guys, these guys have disc, a 12.7 millimeter, you know, anti aircraft gun out there. So be ready for some significant heavy weapons. And sure enough, that's the guy on the rooftop thinking to himself, I can't believe this guy with the disco founding again. Yeah man. The end. And that was one of the big lessons learned when I got to trade at where guys would put 50 rounds of 50 cow into a building with blanks, you know, simulating combat and, and then we'd have a trade that guy in there that would get up and shoot someone and they'd be like, that's bullshit.

Speaker 1:          00:42:02       You know, the guy that that would never happen. And I'm like, Oh yes, it would happen. You know, you, we had guys survive 25 millimeter chain gun from, from Bradley's and still stumble out of, you know, not friendlies. Not, not, not for me, but, but uh, you know, there was enemy that made it out of buildings that had whatever, however many rounds, a bunch of 25 millimeter chain gun rounds coming out of the building. They were coming and going into your building and they'd still live. So you don't know what's gonna happen with bullets, you know, you just don't know. It's hard to tell. And that, yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:42:38       frustration in the blame casting that goes on some of that training. We'll get into that that later. But man,

Speaker 1:          00:42:46       Gosh that that 50 cal is such a bad ass weapon.

Speaker 3:          00:42:51       Yeah. Period. And then, you know, later on we had those things mount on our trucks and uh, the clearance of Mozel guys were Stopping v bids that are completely armored with those things. Just hammering on him. But then it's on a crows remote system

Speaker 1:          00:43:09       and what does a number, that's just a beautiful thing. It's incredible that that gun was made in the early 19 hundreds. Yeah, yeah. For sure. John Browning. Yeah. That's an incredible weapon. Use the exact same weapon today. That's amazing. That's a feat of engineering.

Speaker 3:          00:43:26       Someone was asking me when I posted, uh, pictures of all the brass all over the floor of that room on, on Instagram. They're like, oh, did you have any jams? Oh, we know how to set our head space and timing. Got The gauge right there on it.

Speaker 1:          00:43:38       Boom. That's it. That's an awesome weapon. Now another way, you know what, you were telling me another one about getting extracted in like a, like a, like, like a Russian, like hip 17.

Speaker 3:          00:43:53       So the, um, we went into this operation in Zari parents way, which is a really, really hot area and we didn't like to drive anywhere because Afghanistan's limited, you know, it's limited roads and so they're IED threat was huge. Plus there were culverts everywhere, so they would just pack all the, a covert full of explosives and it could blow up like, you know, to me, uh, amwraps would kill everybody that, and uh, so we didn't have helicopter support for this one operation, but we were working with the DEA fast teams and they had their own Hilo support and they had these [inaudible] which are these, you know, Russian helicopters, which are super durable helicopters and uh, um, contracted, you know, American pilots in them obviously. Okay, that's cool. And so they had this operation and they're like, hey, you guys want to go on it with us?

Speaker 3:          00:44:54       So we're, you know, we're the main force on that. And it was during one of our turnover ops. It was actually the op after the, the a when Dan lost his leg. So we did to two and uh, get dropped off first thing in the morning, go in clear to compounds and we found a whole bunch of a on that there were fields and fields of marijuana around here. And then on that operation, one of the compounds just had a whole bunch of Hash, was like huge burlap sacks of, of Hash. And I think, I think they said there was 200 pounds and in the middle they destroyed it. And so it was the typical thing that happened. Women and children left. Fighters came in and then we were in, you know, a three 60 firefight and we're in the firefight and over the radio we're hearing from, from our aircraft overhead, they're saying, hey, there's a white van

Speaker 2:          00:45:57       and

Speaker 3:          00:45:58       it's dropping fighters off around you. So this white, this white minivan is driving off, picking up fighters and then driving a big circle around us and dropping off fighters. So this is like an hour later firefights that thing I did the story. So about an hour later there's, they're like, hey, the white coming over because I'm a, I'm on dual calm so I can hear on the fires net and, and that's like the other radio frequency outside of inner squad comms for those, if you don't understand that is just this one where the aircraft are talking and when we're where we're all talking and I'm on both of them and I can hear the aircraft saying that white van is back. And so all of a sudden I'm looking straight north at 200 yards and I see a white van pull into the open and stop in, you know, in an alleyway. So get on the radio. Where's that white van and is it directly north? Our position and the aircraft comes back. Yeah, I had just dropped off. Two guys in there stop. They're looking at you right now. Crack that crack two rounds and then a 60 gunner just moes the thing down and they're just done through, well, firefight just kept going. Now the MRI seventeens they can't fly after dark. They didn't have some kind of certification, so they had to come in there and do a hot extract on that LZ to get us off. So there's,

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       there's bullets flying all over the place. We get stacked to set our breakout, so everyone's kind of broken down from their position. We slept security, they're there setting up the LZ. And then my job as the senior enlisted guy on my aircraft was I run out, I'm the first guy to the aircraft and I count guys getting on and on the last guy on that aircraft. So that aircraft isn't going until I have whatever number of people getting on it, getting on it, everybody's piling on there. I got a full head count. I'm like, I got a full head count and there's no seats for me. So I gotta hop on the ramp and hook an arm through one of the guy's legs. My feet are dangling off the ramp as we take off. And then I'm shooting just half ass from the hip because it's fun just for John, the qual, just for the call of the apocalypse and now qual at at a, you know, a place we were taking fire from as we took off. And then we got out of there. That was a, it was a lot of fun. I going to stop short of saying as awesome cause I'm not going to use that word anymore, but it was pretty Dang awesome right there. That's the consequences. Yeah, it was.

Speaker 1:          00:48:40       They no one got hurt. No one got wounded. Not In that one. Nope. Amazing.

Speaker 3:          00:48:45       Like you said, all these bullets are flying around and it's just incredible because just the laws of chance.

Speaker 1:          00:48:52       Yeah. Well those aircraft too, you know, it's like, um, those old school aircraft, like when you read about the Vietnam guys, and I'm reading a book right now, those aircraft, they were flying these kings, they were, they had a Vietnamese pilots in these king B Aircrafts and those things, they, the guy came back from one off, they had 48 holes in it, been shot 48 times. And, and this American SF guys looking at the aircraft and if he's looking at the pilot he's getting in like you were and he gets in and he's looking at this Vietnamese pilot and the Vietnamese pilot looks cool. He's just like Roger and I've got to use a great quote. The guy says something along the lines of when I'm flying, I'm just thinking about flying. I'm not thinking about bad guys, I'm not thinking about bullets, I'm just flying my aircraft.

Speaker 1:          00:49:40       If it's my day, it's my day period and the story. But that coming into hot extract like that, that's catch and those guys, they, they come in super fast and super low speeds, speeds on their side and it is sketchy. It's a, I was in a random Russian aircraft helicopter. A hip or what are you, am I 17 I guess the, the, the, the NATO term is like a hip. But yeah, I was in Africa working and, and that's like we needed to get somewhere and the only thing they could get us was he contracted contracted helicopters but there was, but it was contracted pilots too. And I was happy to land on that one.

Speaker 3:          00:50:21       Those are a pretty common side over there in Afghanistan. A lot of the other other agencies using those. And somebody had told me, and I don't know if this is true or not, that they were, they were so inexpensive, it wasn't worth doing the maintenance on them. So when they got to a maintenance schedule, they just destroy it and buy another one. That's crazy. Yeah. And I don't know if that's true. You know, that's something I heard from some guy over at the Chow Hall who yeah, who was well informed apparently. But those pilots were so, so good and they, you know, they were all probably ex TF, one 60 guys that were now hired on by these other guys that do the job over there. I was incredible. So speaking of wounded or in that case, not willing to, but you were telling me a story about, um, and I cut you off so you didn't tell it to me.

Speaker 3:          00:51:14       You were telling me a story about a Taliban guy getting shot in the leg. Yeah. So last time I was telling you the story about the last time I was telling you the story about the uh, the operation where we'd set pop flares out cause guys were, were able to get so close to us and during that firefight, one of our firing positions up on a roof, they're like, hey there was, there was someone that had circled around kind of behind our position and we weren't taking any fire form. They were in, in, in the process of trying to flank us and they're like, hey there's a guy back here and we just shot him. We killed him. So stuff calmed down and I talked to the t u commander. I'm like, Hey I'm going to press out with these two guys cause it appeared as if it was like right around the corner around this wall and we're going to go see if the guy's got a radio on him or anything like that.

Speaker 3:          00:52:07       So we push out of the compound and we loop around a wall but it's not just one wall, it's several walls and we get a little bit farther away. So we round the corner where the guy's supposed to be and there's no dead guy at all, but there's a guy standing 30 yards away on a hill and he shooting at me. So I have got, I'm patrolling with my scar heavy, but I folded the buttstock like a dummy. And because I, you know, I thought that was a cool way to patrol. And so now I'm like, oh no, I can't shoulder my, my scar. So I just tried to lock it out on like five ks. Yes. Lot Punch it out, dude. Just punch it, squeezed at him, missed him. And then it had a stove, pipe and a g a fee jam. So I just took a knee and started to reload and then cleared the jam real quick.

Speaker 3:          00:53:04       Started shooting again, but he was gone. And then, uh, he turned up again when, uh, when we had, when we went to do our extract the following day, we had to clear a couple buildings near where, uh, uh, the Hilos were going to land. And then we found that same guy with his leg all bandaged up. They, they didn't kill them. They just shot him in the leg and then we just wound up, you know, leaving him there. W so like, so was that the last time you patrolled with your scar or have you with the stock folded it and then, you know, on another op it was, it, I learned the lesson of never taken off my body armor and helmet because it was hot. Yeah. What happened on that one? Oh my goodness. So we were, um, it was a operation Swally caught where we'd taken high ground above a couple of compounds that we'd cleared and the next day the towel, we, we'd gotten to the point right where we had, we'd started to get a little bit complacent and all our engagements with the Taliban, we'd always had the upper hand against them.

Speaker 3:          00:54:18       We'd a, uh, completely, we had air power, we had better weapons, we were trained better. Yup. And on this operation we had a, uh, a piece of high ground right behind the compounds that we took. Was everyone wearing, was that when you use an AA cogs on their, on their scars generally, or what were they using guys? W variety of a cogs. The snipers actually took the, the scopes off their Sr 20 fives and put them on the, uh, the scar everyone had basically everyone had scopes and so lots of them. And we had 300 s winmac sniper rifles. So we brought along on this, I'm just thinking mentally from the viewpoint of where the enemy's at. Like you're reaching out and touching them accurately, way further than they can get you. Pretty much, which, which again will leans towards you thinking to yourself, we're going to kick these guys ass every time.

Speaker 3:          00:55:04       Yup. And then you did kicked your ass a bunch of times. And so then these guys start to take on high ground all around all our positions and we can see a guy pushing out with a PKM onto this flat ledge, a rock. He's 1100 yards away and we're shooting at him with a 300 wind magnet. It's windy and we're missing, we're missing clothes. And he'd go back and then come back out, go back, come back out. And they were getting set up all around us and then they just brought it. They let us go with a salvo of uh, um, rocket propelled grenade grenades and then just steady PKM fire. And we thought there 300 yards out, they really can't do that much. Oh it's, you know, 105 degrees out. So we'll take our body armor and helmets off and then they just laid the hammer down.

Speaker 3:          00:56:00       Luckily for me, I happened to be right on top of my body, arm and helmet cause I was in, in the prone position and then I just was able to snake into my body on my, get my helmet back on my head. And you know, in this, this is a position where this is the first time we'd been somewhere where we couldn't feel sand back. So we just stacked a bunch of rocks as best we could to a fighting position. And the bullets were just steadily hammering the rocks and hammering the rocks and hammering the rocks. And I was thinking, man, alive, I'm going to get shot. And I wonder if it's going to hurt, but it's definitely going to happen. The odds are odds are there and

Speaker 1:          00:56:40       somehow I didn't. And then a,

Speaker 3:          00:56:43       then B, a, B, one bomber came on station and dropped a whole bunch of ordinance and laid the hammer down. But after that, and I ran out of water, we all ran out of water up on this high ground position. It was like 112, 14 degrees at two in the afternoon we ran under water and there was no getting any water until uh, that night when the sun went down.

Speaker 1:          00:57:04       Did you listen to that podcast with Ron Sugar on? I'm sure I did. Yeah. SF Guy. A medal of honor recipient. But if you go watch the videos. Oh, that, yeah. Yeah. The like the castle that they're attacking. That's crazy. Just straight up hill. I was just, I couldn't believe that I, I, when I, when I, as I was reading, like I was reading a bunch of articles about this situation and then they kept talking about video and I said, okay, I'll check out youtube. And I saw it back. I couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe it in the way he described it. It was just incredible. He just laid it out there. He's like, Oh yeah, you know? Yeah, he's so understated. He's like, well, you know, it was a little bit of a hill and there was a pretty big building [inaudible] it was a cliff and there was a castle on top of the cliff.

Speaker 1:          00:57:52       Now if we get a awesome guy, you don't. Other things that we were talking about and you made, obviously this is good leaving Afghanistan, but it's getting back early in your career when you were, when you failed the stocking section of sniper school and then you went back and you and you, you obviously made it through, you pass us the, the stocking section. And you kind of touched on it when you were on last time, but I was wondering like a little bit more granularity on what you changed that you went from failing the stocks to alright, here's, here's me knocking out whatever. A 10 yeah. And it comes down to basically doing what I'd been taught [inaudible] and people were telling me is that you start the stock,

Speaker 3:          00:58:44       you're told to find the oop, which is, you know, 1200 yards away. And the first thing you've got to do is figure out where that o p obser and o p is an observation point and that's where the the guys that are grading you on the stock, who are other sniper instructors, that's where they're at. And you take that this model, and I was just thinking how it applies to problem solving basically across the board where,

Speaker 1:          00:59:12       okay,

Speaker 3:          00:59:14       I need to find a goal in my future here somewhere. In this case it's the stock. And then before start executing on moving toward that, that goal, going to find that, oop, I need to take some time and study the terrain and see what my, you know, line of attack is going to be in hell. I'm going to move all the way up to where to where I'm going to go and then I need to put it into action. And while I'm putting an action, I'm constantly reassessing that goal and adjusting my actions across the way. And that when I went from that model, I went from, you know, failing stocks to being the first one done, hardly spending any time on my belly and doing that. So then you take that and you apply it to life. And do you think about just goal setting?

Speaker 3:          01:00:08       Where do, where do I want to be in five years and identify it and then say, okay, do a little research, how do I get there? And then get on that damn path, stay disciplined and then just keep the eye on the target and keep adjusting your aim as you go. And I can look back at times in my life where really I wasn't paying attention. I'm really just treading water, you know, living paycheck to paycheck, doing whatever. And now you know, I take, take that model and I apply it to where do I want to be in five years, where all I want my kids to be, what kind of parent do I want to be and how am I going to get there? And what's the path I'm going to lay out for you? And this is from a leadership perspective. Obviously this applies because from a leadership perspective, if you're, and I was just on Peter t as a podcast and we were talking about a little bit about that strategic framework, tactical, right?

Speaker 3:          01:01:07       And listening to that this morning hand, and you know what I said to him where it first started to occur to me that was, hey, if my guys don't know what it is that we're trying to accomplish, they can't make it. They can't, they can't move in there. Sure, I can tell them, move eight yards forward and then they can't hear me anymore. Now what? They're going to wait for me to get wherever they are. I can say, go take that building right there. Well now they can't hear me any more. So now what are they gonna do? They're gonna sit there and wait for me to come up and tell them to do something else. No, they need to know what we're trying to get accomplished. And then they need to have this, the standard operating procedures down well enough. So they end the parameters that they're allowed to maneuver within.

Speaker 3:          01:01:41       And that allows us to actually accomplish the mission. And that's something I think I, I mean I don't even know when I learned that, but without that strategic objective, and that's a strong word. Okay, I get it. I get strategic. I get what it means, and I'm not talking about you know, global warfare, but when you're in a town and you have a mission objective that, okay, we're going to get to this building or we're going to move to this area, or we're going to take this piece of terrain and everybody knows that. And even when those things change, because as you know, you get into a contact or you get into a situation where you change what you're doing. You have to let know that, hey,

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       we're breaking contact, we're getting out of here. Hey, we're going to strongly in this building or whatever. Once everybody knows that, then they can act on it. Then they can carry it out. Same, same thing that w of what you're talking about. They're now on a bigger picture. Of course it still applies on a bigger picture of if your troops in the field don't know what it is you're trying to achieve, then they make bad decisions. If they don't know that you're trying to protect the populace, if they don't know that that's a broad strategy, then they get out there and treat the populace. They act like idiots. If they know that's what they're trying to do, then they make better. I'm not saying they make perfect decisions because they don't, but they'll make better decisions because they understand what that broad strategy is and it's certainly the same thing in business and with business that goes back and forth too because business sometimes in business your, you know, I run into it with businesses where there, for instance, trying to go public so they need to make money every quarter.

Speaker 1:          01:03:11       They can just show that profitability increase and so the biggest thing they got on their mind is trying to show a good quarter and they'll sacrifice some strategic things like the sacrifice, a little bit of taking care of a customer because they want to scrape a little more money out of it, out of the situation. That's a bad strategic play, but they do it short term at the time because they know they've got to make more in the quarter so they can come back and reinvest more so, but everybody's got to know that because if everyone thinks, hey, hey, the number one thing is we never let our customers down. Okay, guess what? We lost money this quarter. Now we, now we can't go public because we, and again, this is really a kindergarten level examples, but that's the kind of thing where what you're talking about, if people don't understand what that longer term goal is, then they can't really operate and function on their own, which is a problem.

Speaker 1:          01:04:03       No, you're not thinking longterm. You're just thinking day to day basically. Yeah. I kind of went off at the muster on that one kid that asked me, how often are you thinking strategically and how often are you thinking tactically? And you know, I just kind of was going off about, look man, every single thing I do is strategic. I'm not making any tactical moves. I'm not, I'm not worried about the tactical wins and losses. Now, there's a reason for that. I'm in a good spot right now where a little tactical loss doesn't mean that much to me right now. And it's really easy for me to just focus on the strategic stuff. You know, when I was younger I had to focus more on some tactical things. You know, that's the way it is. But even as a young person, you got to keep that straight.

Speaker 1:          01:04:48       You know, you might have to take some tactical, you might have to, you might have to make some adjustments and wind some short torn battles just cause that's the way it is. But you should be thinking tactics all the time. Or sorry, you should be thinking strategy all the time. You should be thinking long game all the time. All the time. Thinking about the long game all the time, thinking about how was this decision affect where I'm going to be in the long term because the short term decisions, those are the ones that beat you down.

Speaker 1:          01:05:14       Yeah. I've turned on that long game nested inside that longterm goal, you know, strategy. Yeah. Yeah. I, I actually kind of appreciated that he brought that up. Oh totally. It was a good question. He was at, and he was a younger guy and you could see he's thinking, you know, he'd probably, he probably thought to himself, hey, it seems like Jocko keeps talking about the long game. And he thought to himself, how often is Jocko thinking about that? And so he asked the question good on him. So I could explain. I'm thinking about it all the time. I'm thinking about all the time.

Speaker 3:          01:05:44       That's the way you gotta do it. And it beat routine as well for bringing that, that the whole framework of the bringing the whole framework and everything up. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Aspect of that. Listen to that. And this morning I'm like, yeah, this lase. That's the same thing that makes you successful on a stock. Choosing that goal and then working your way to it. Doing your, you know, and you gotta watch out for the situation where you get paralysis by analysis or, and that's caught up by, you had a time limit on a stock. Okay, you got three hours to get this done. So you got to get it figured out and you've got to get moving. Or I think a lot of people will fall into that trap where they do too much study, too, too much study, and then they're, no, you're turning to actual life in life in general. Sure. In stocks, guys will run out of time.

Speaker 1:          01:06:36       I said something the other day, uh, most things don't get finished cause most things don't get started then people won't even start peeling. Even make that move. Of course. Hey, guess what? Big shocker. There's a dichotomy and that's the bottom line. There's a dichotomy. If you rush into it and you start moving without having a longterm plan, you're probably going to make a bad move. If you take too long, you're going to wait too long. And the whole, it's gonna pass you by. So you have to constantly modulate and figure out where you're at and no one's gonna be able to give you the answer. I can't sit here and be like, Oh, you know what you wanna do right there. You want to make this? No, no one's gonna be sitting there telling you that day by day you've got to figure that out and you got to figure out if it's really, really moving you in the right direction. Yup. Way It's gotta be. When you were talking about coming back to trade at, and you know, you and I both had the, the, the luck to be at trade at in the positions we were in. I was the, I was the trade at OIC. You were the trade at CMC. So basically where the senior dudes, we weren't together unfortunately, but what a good job and what a good opportunity to see how things unfold and what a good opportunity to take these standard operating procedures and pressure test them. Exactly. So

Speaker 3:          01:07:56       I was hit up the other day in a brief where I was talking about when I was there as a troop sea and we did our first FTX and you had just trained, changed training to where we bef prior to that and every time I'd been through land warfare prior to coming through as as at the troop senior enlisted advisor in 2008 our FTX is, we're all live fire, great live-fire school, but it's so canned because it has to be for safety that it really doesn't put any pressure on the leadership and there's not really any pressure brought to bear on any of your slps. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:08:36       To put this simply to everyone, when you're in a gunfight, there's two horrible things that the enemy will do. They will shoot at you and they will maneuver. And when you're using live fire for training, your enemy is a bunch of paper targets. At best. They're mounted on those little carts that can move around, but they're very, very limited. No, not even remotely close to what a human being is going to do. So when you're going with live fire, your enemy neither shoots back at you nor do they maneuver. So in the seal teams we would destroy our paper targets all the time. We would crush them all the time relentlessly. We would out maneuver them cause they couldn't move. We would out shoot them cause they didn't shoot. So it was pretty easy to dominate and you sure there was that level of, of stress of the fact that is live fire.

Speaker 1:          01:09:25       And when you're out like in the desert you are and you and you do do, and we still do this where you have to shift fire and you're walking and you're, you know, you're, you're making sure that you're safe cause you can't, you know, you can, you can shoot each other. But that type of stress compared to the stress of, okay now the enemy we're using, we're using laser tag guns or paint ball and the enemy has a full on maneuvering their full on shooting back at us. That's a, that's a big step up. Yeah. And so we just completely epically

Speaker 3:          01:09:56       that first operation and we took a hard look at the four biggest things we did wrong and identified where our standard operating procedures were flawed. And then we sat down with our leadership and we got input and started a Mont modify those slps too, so we could build up standard operating procedures that were resilient enough to withstand all the pressures that you guys were putting on us and training. And uh, someone asked me [inaudible] at a, uh, a keynote I was given the other day. Like, well, didn't you guys have sop prior to that when we absolutely did, but they weren't good good enough because they couldn't withstand the pressure. So they had to be modified. We had to modify the way we were doing slps for getting headcounts. We had to modify how we were dealing with our down men. Like, honestly, we weren't carrying litters around.

Speaker 3:          01:10:55       We weren't, but it's just an absolute abject disaster. If you get a wounded guy, sure I can drag him off the x. But now if I patch him up and I got to throw him over my shoulder again, I'm going to blow out every bandage I just put on him. That's stupid. You know, um, our radio comms going with when everything is confusing, we had to fix that. So we had to dial those slps in the standard operating procedures. And the beauty of, of trade at is that as stuff is happening on the battlefield, we immediately modify that in the training. And we're putting that on top of the guys and training so they can see if their standard operating procedures are good to go or if they're flawed and they need to be modified. So we can constantly modified if people are honest about them.

Speaker 3:          01:11:46       Yeah. And that's, that's the beauty of the, basically the petri dish or the lab that we had out there at trade at. Cause the other thing is we could see when, when people were being honest about their mistakes or one guys where were blame casting and not taking ownership of what was going on and uh, and not being honest with the recipes. And then you just develop these slps like they don't just apply to the battlefield. We came up with standard operating procedures for uh, you know, how we did our admin stuff, how we dealt with, with anything that you can think of. We would think of a good way to do it and then test it and then run through it. So you know, you might not like this, this analogy, but I think that sop is kind of our a life hack because is one of those things that you can lay,

Speaker 1:          01:12:42       there is no work. I know except for the standard operating procedure is pretty Dang close to one. Yeah. You know what's, as you were, as you were talking about that, one thing that I definitely noticed is the, you could have almost 90% of the time that you use the word modify our sop. You could have used the word simplify because most of the time it was someone saying, hey, we got this crazy we, this is what we're going to do. We're going to do this and you can do that. And it has all these crazy things. And they realized that doesn't work. So you make it simpler and simpler. Now, where that's counterintuitive is like in extreme ownership where I talked about doing SSC, and when we first started doing SSE, the plan was real simple, just smash everything and just take whatever you'd find right.

Speaker 1:          01:13:30       But that was horrible plan and it didn't work. So we had to, we had to put something that was a little bit more looked on the surface to be a little bit more complex, even though when you broke down the individual human beings and what they were doing, it was a very straightforward and very simple, so, so yeah. Yeah, no, there's no doubt that having that opportunity to watch slps get tested and either pass or fail, and it was so obvious either way, because it was so cool in the tunes. And the taskings would start to work together and they'd start to cover, move for each other, and they'd start to use the centralized command. They would, they would crush the trade at guys, or they would absolutely would at least get the best of them. They'd at least kill them all. Whereas when they're not doing it, it would be comical for Che that guys would kill 40 guys or whatever it was.

Speaker 1:          01:14:17       Then you just be thinking, hmm, and and, and you're right. This is where you'd have ego problems would show up because guys would think, and it was so hard from, from my perspective, from your perspective when you're like, listen, the Trade Ed cadre is going to do the same there they did the same thing to last nine troops or the last five troops. They did this exact same scenario and and the other troops used simple standard operating procedures that cover to move. They use decentralized command and they they one, here's what you're doing. This is from my perspective and I know it's hard, but what you're doing is you're trying to control everyone or what you're doing is you've got these, these standard operating procedures that are too complicated or you're not prioritizing and executing your just, you've got to follow these simple rules and it would be hard to convey to some guys if the guys wanted to put up their ego barrier and let it offend them and think no would never happen or no, that's just the trade that guys knew what we were going to do.

Speaker 1:          01:15:12       Yeah. The trade guys know what you're gonna do. You know what you're attacking a target area. Anyone, any, any military mind in the world is going to get the high ground and then they're going to sweep through if they can from high ground to low ground. That's what the s what everyone's going to do. It's not like the trade hat guys that anybody could figure that out. Any military mind is going to look at a target and do it one of three ways or one of four ways, and 50% of those four ways actually is going to overlap. So you don't have to be a freaking rocket science or scientist or or, or, or Napoleon to be able to figure out, okay, here's the target. Where do I think the seals are going to come in from? It's like, oh, okay. They're probably gonna come in from here.

Speaker 1:          01:15:53       I'll set up two guys there. There's also a chance they're gonna come in from over here. Call. I'll put two guys over there. There you go. We knew you knew our plan. It's like, yeah, Bro. The enemy is, it's like you talked about, you had situations where you went in and you're like, oh, well we'll go get on the high ground. Oh, the enemy put ids there. Yeah. Guess what? It doesn't take a rocket science to figure out, Oh, if you're going to assault us here, you're probably gonna want to get this piece of this piece of terrain over here. So that would offend guys. And they'd get into the, hey, this is, this is wrong. And instead of saying, okay, what did I do wrong? Can you just, can you just tell me what I did wrong again cause I didn't, I'm not sure I understand it.

Speaker 1:          01:16:31       Oh well what you did is this, you didn't prioritize next to you or you didn't use decentralized command and they will just fit if you're not gonna listen to that, you know, it's a problem. I had a guy at the muster just asking me about like how do you handle it when someone really picks you apart on a debrief? And I'm like, Bro, you know I handled that. I what I do is I look them right in the eye and I say thank you. Thank you for telling me that. Please thank you and, and I appreciate it and I'm going to go look at what you just told me and I'm going to try and figure out if I can fix it. Because otherwise, like you, you just, I could see it in this guy's eyes. Like he's asking me that question because his ego is getting offended.

Speaker 1:          01:17:15       I, everyone's ego gets offended. Mine gets it. I get offended when somebody tells me that when somebody gives me the nine big debrief points on what I did wrong, I'm freaking mad. I don't want to make mistakes. I even ego just like everyone else, if not a freaking larger ego than anyone else. And when somebody tells me I did nine things wrong, I'm pissed. I'm pissed at myself, and it's really easy for me to look at you and get pissed at you for telling me that I screwed this up. But instead I've gotten old enough to realize even if I don't like you, it's even harder if I don't like you. It's even harder when I don't like you. It's even harder, right? That's what makes it super hard. But when you go, you know what, Eh, you bite down and you go, okay, thank you.

Speaker 1:          01:17:52       Let me assess what you just told me. If you could make that little step up in your life, it's epic. And when guys would, to your point, when guys wouldn't make that step in that step up in coming through the trade at training, it would be a nightmare. It was a nightmare. And the thing is, man, like I love all these team guys. I want them to go kick ass. I, that's all I wanted was them to like go do great things on deployment. And when you get that, the guy coming through that just would be offended by it and I, I'd be so bummed out, I'd, you know, I'd just, I'd be so bummed out. I'd be like, Bro, I just want you to do good. I'm just telling you like don't focus on a head count when you're in the firefight. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. And then, then you get to the point where

Speaker 3:          01:18:43       you're just like, oh man, you're not going to get it now. I'm just going to make you suffer. Yeah. But the cause you get, you'll get critique points where guys will say, hey, we need to get an op so we can go start to finish where you let us win basically. And you know, if you're playing football and your college team goes against the high school team, that's not challenging for anybody and you're not gonna really learn anything out of it. And that's the learning thing. That's why I gave you a walkthrough. And so after seeing that so many times and running land warfare and I started going out at the front day one and saying, hey guys, listen, you're going to get a walkthrough. That's your time to work through your whole script on how you're going to run a target assault. But I'm shortchanging you if I'm not putting pressure on you when we have these FTX nights, cause we only have this place for a limited period of time and this is where you're going to find where your weak points are and get better.

Speaker 3:          01:19:44       And then knowing about myself when I have those two voices arguing in my head, the one that's my ego and it's making an excuse for everything that you're, that someone who's debriefing me is picking apart and the other reasonable voice, which I'm trying to turn the volume up on, um, that's going, oh yeah, that's a fair critique. Yeah. Well I got a little lazy there. Shouldn't have taken my body armor off. Uh, that, that kind of stuff. Or where the worst was like the OIC that would come out after you were OIC in he, if he came out to training and he would find some stuff that was screwed up and he's like, why am I the one fixing it? And I'm like, you are exactly right. And guys who get angry, he's like, you'd come down here and he calls us out. He goes, we deserve it.

Speaker 3:          01:20:37       Let's not do this ever again. We cannot have our boss coming out here and looking at how we're running, training and calling us out. And a lot of it was for, I'll give you an example, go out to an I ads range and a platoon is decided to have their 60 gunner walk point because that's going to work good for an immediate action drill. But that's not what you're really going to do. That's patrol to contact. That's not what we're training in an immediate action drill when we're training for a sucker punch and he's like, what in the wide world of sports is going on here? And we'd be like, yeah, but guys wouldn't want to tell the platoon. It'd be one of these small things where, and I failed in this. And in leadership a lot of times where it's just like, oh I'll just let that slide, I'll just let the, I'm pretty soon everything's sliding and you're not really given people any guidance.

Speaker 3:          01:21:32       But uh, um, yeah, people comment, you gotta be honest with the critique and look at it and then move forward. And at the end of the day you always kind of know when you're wrong and to take ownership of it, you feel better about it. Cause now you have power over it, right? And then it's like, Oh, if I think that the trade ed staff is cheating now I'm powerless against it and it's just kind of a stressor that I'm deal. Exactly are just going to win. It doesn't matter. Blah Blah. And then it's, it's also on on a trade debt. It's, and it's difficult to to debrief people and not come off as condescending. That's a real skill. And that's the, some guys are really good at that and that's something I tried to work on and I'm not perfect at it. But to give people constructive criticism in a manner that they'll accept it, that it doesn't want to like on poker talked about that and traded is you don't really have a good relationship with 50% of the guys that are coming through.

Speaker 3:          01:22:34       So some guys that come through, like when you're coming through I'm like, hey bro, like we, I could just like be pretty straight up with you guys. I don't really know you and you're from like a different team and I never worked with you before. So I have no sort of sort of relationship and then it's harder, you know, to say, hey man, that was a really bad job, you know, now I don't know. I what I, what I ended up doing the trade out was I would just be like, hey, this is what happened, you know? And by the way, I recorded you on my audio thing. Like I would carry a little voice recorder and then when people would be panicking or freaking out, I would record

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       them and I'd say, you were kind of freaking out out there and you'd see them olds and freaking out and be like, okay, listen to this. And everybody was like, does that sound like freaking out to your, is that your calm voice? So

Speaker 3:          01:23:18       the, and the other fun thing about the dead skier was you could hit them with the near miss because if they got killed, they would get now drugged through the desert by their ankle and guys didn't want to die. So they still weren't as honest about fire as they could be, but they would still like my favorite thing to do would be put the God gone, which is just a regular thing I had as it lane greater on near Miss. And if guys were screwing around like they, they would not, you know, they'd all be standing up in a perimeter where they shouldn't be standing and I would just near miss them all guys would just dive, dive in. No real else.

Speaker 1:          01:24:00       It was like legitimate real routes were covered out of where they'd hear that near missing cause they didn't want to get drugged through the desert for freaking two kilometers to the extract point. Have all their gear be beat up and bruised, gone punished. All their liver has to carry. You was just getting completely punished. Okay. I'm feel buffalo you smell. Yeah. Well I would them younger guys coming out.

Speaker 3:          01:24:24       You know everyone talks about the big millennials and I'm w from what I've seen when I, when I talk to the teams and when I've gone out to some training sites, you guys are awesome. I think across the board they are. Yeah. I've, I mean I've looked at all, all the new guys and the quality of the new guys now compared to who I was. Yeah. I'm not sure I could have made it through training if I was compared against all the guys. Now they're smart, they're motivated and they're hard and they're only coming in because they want to go to a war II. I mean, cause that's a given.

Speaker 1:          01:25:01       Yeah. Did I want to go to war? Absolutely. But it wasn't a known thing. I got to admit that. I kind of thought it was, I thought like, oh I'm going to nom. I thought I was going to Nob in 1991 when I got to the team. But yeah, these guys know for a fact. I mean they, they, they see, they see, they see, you know, memorial services on TV. They know what's what they're getting into for sure.

Speaker 3:          01:25:25       And the, the complaints, the complaints about the millennials that I hear are that, oh, they want to know why they're doing something. Well, Duh. Yeah. You know, and you just covered that in that, that document that was written after rule or two that says, hey, guess what, you need to tell guys why they're doing something or they're not going to be the most effective. And it's generationally, generationally, it's just more blame casting where people are whining about the next generation goes back forever. This is normal, right? I think it's one of those normal whiny things that you got to be the young suck [inaudible] no they don't. You suck.

Speaker 3:          01:26:09       When I was at one of the leadership courses with some regular navy leadership and one of the master chiefs was telling the story that she had any five [inaudible], she worked in, in, in supply and she's like, Hey, I need you to go do the inventory today. And she's checked back, comes back like an hour and a half later. And uh, the guy had to go inventory this whole warehouse and he's hanging out in the coffee lounge and hour and a half later and she's like, Hey, what the heck is going on here? Should freeze. Like I did the inventory and she's like, no way. But it takes all day. Let's spot check it. Spot just randomly pulls up a couple items off that inventory list, checks it. She's like, how did you do this? And he's like, well you know I got this app reader on my phone and I just went and scanned all the bar codes, used his phone and completed the inventory like that with a little bit of ingenuity and so basically she just told him the end state and got out of his way. It was by accident, but she got out of his way and let him figure out how something to do it and then then went with it.

Speaker 1:          01:27:25       Nothing wrong with that. Nope. What about for you as you've gotten older, what kind of mindset changes have you gone through where like I've just kind of talked about one from my perspective, your, as I got older I see see different things and I always try and make that perfectly clear to everyone that you know, I kind of

Speaker 2:          01:27:47       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:27:48       you know, I learned, I learned and I'm still learning. And so, you know, would you, what, what, what like were some things that if you could have learned or changed your, your mentality on earlier?

Speaker 3:          01:28:05       Like what, yeah, I mean for shutting down the Ego, uh, you know, a lot of my growth honestly is being married to IRS and is 100% responsible for her and just shuts down your ego, shuts my ego down, but then has on honest conversations about, well what are you really thinking here? And then, you know, actually listening to what someone's saying cause the trap I used to fall into was when someone was talking to me, I wasn't really listening to them. I was just formulating what I was going to say back.

Speaker 1:          01:28:40       Did that formulating your calendar?

Speaker 3:          01:28:43       Exactly. And I probably score a high in trait disagreeableness yeah. So you know, it's just my nature to want to be at that point of friction. But that also makes me just, you know, want to go stick my finger in people's eyes and offend them and stuff that and so stepping back and opening my mind up to other points of view, um, and then being a little bit more cognizant of other people and how they're reacting to me so I can adjust how I interact with them. Relation

Speaker 1:          01:29:21       ship wise, I don't know if you remember this question at the muster guide asked, hey, what, what do you do when you, how do you deal with someone who's super negative and about, you know, the, the, the team or whatever. And you know, I said, here's a really good leadership technique that you can use. It's very complicated. It's called listen how much you listen to them, but you actually listened to what people are saying. Somebody feels really negative about my team. Guess what? I want to know why. I want to actually hear their explanation as to why they're being super negative. And by the way, when you allow someone to voice their opinion and you listened to them carefully, instead of formulating our counterparts, which is what our instinct is to do, if instead of you go, okay, what's wrong, Jason wouldn't mean what's, what's the problem over here? I actually want to listen to you. I want to hear what you have to say. And that is such an advantage as a leader instead of always feeling like, Hey, anybody that steps to me is getting crushed. Like no, actually anybody that steps to me, he's going to teach me something and I'm happy to hear it. Yeah. Boom.

Speaker 1:          01:30:26       And then just

Speaker 3:          01:30:27       are you aware of, you know, by my biases, my biases. And then I find this a lot of times with the Dang media presses the heck out of my buttons. And so I got to the point where I just, I don't watch the news anymore because the news is, is hard. It's there to get you angry so you'll pay attention to it and gets them better ratings. Yeah. And a lot of times when I'll see some really extreme things that they're claiming people said, when I dig into, when I actually take the time to dig into it, it's like not quite what it was. And now that I've become a lot more introspective and so I'm paying attention to how things make me react. I'm paying attention to when my face flushes out or I grip. And I'm like, okay, now it's time to detach and step back.

Speaker 3:          01:31:18       I've noticed that that just like, it's not as not a positive positive, you know, thing in my life to have my blood pressure spiked again and again and again and again because I've got a 24 hour news feed coming in. And so, uh, another teen guy pointed this out to me. He's like, Hey, I'm just talking about the news and I was all angry about something and he's like, you know what? I quit watching the news and he goes, I'm a lot happier since I stopped watching the news. It doesn't matter. And I'm like, are you kidding me? Of course it matters. But he planted a little seed and watered it. And then I'm like, okay, I'm going to quit watching the news and it doesn't, it doesn't matter. And I was the point where I'll just check the news like first thing in the morning and make sure a volcano went off.

Speaker 3:          01:32:03       Right now I don't even do that. If there's a volcano going off, I'll see the smoke or someone will tell you that you're going to find out about it. The 24 hour news cycles filled with a lot of things that you don't need to know. You don't need to know at all. And that's, that's Kinda the way I am. I mean, I still look at it, but it doesn't, it, I'm completely, I, I can look at, I can look at 19 headlines in a row and none of them have any remote impact on my mentality at all until I see one that says, oh, there was a terror bombing here. And I go, oh, okay, let's see what's going on. Or Hey, there was a US servicemen killed here. And I'm like, oh, okay. But every other of the 17 headlines that I read that were, um, I'm trying to think of a good one right now cause there's just, you know, everything is going down and you're like, okay, fine.

Speaker 3:          01:32:51       Yeah I can get no, everything's not going down. The world isn't going to end, but it's clickbait isn't, yeah, it is. You guys are the first ones I heard use that word. I'm like, oh, that's what that is. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Well what? It's going clickbait, but it's just clickbait on the TV to get you to dial in and get them higher ratings. And then you got to listen to that. Sam Harrison, I forget the female's name that was on, but she did this whole research about it. They're talking about how the Russian, the Russian bots and all that stuff and yeah, you can create headlines that are gonna make people click and then you can make fictional random, you can just make up stories and peep. They'll catch fit. You know, someone else will report that story as being true. It's a crazy world.

Speaker 3:          01:33:35       The onion joke, newspaper AP is pick their stuff up like two or three times before. Totally nuts. So you got to learn. You should definitely adult mom learn to detach when you read the news. Yeah. And then, uh, something that I found real helpful is, is putting a filter on my thoughts. So the, and this is something that iris is Kinda talked about. She's like, the first filter is am I whining? And then the second filter is, am I resentful? And then the third filter is, am I jealous? And if I can just catch that stuff, once I identify it, it doesn't bother me anymore. But prior to identifying it, if I'm just like, oh, someone told just got a promotion, well that's bullshit. He, you know, and then, then I realize, oh, wait a minute, I should be happy for him for getting that promotion. Uh, and Jordan Peterson says something about be careful who you share good news with and, and, and I just don't, I, that's not, that's not something I, I, I'm proud of when I see it come up in myself. And it's one of the things that, that as I age on, I'm trying to fix. The other thing that, that as I've gotten older is I used to be very identified

Speaker 1:          01:34:59       and now I find myself becoming more of an individual, if that makes sense. That makes sense. And understand this, this is, that's where I'm trying to go and this is, this is the path that, uh, that I'm on and it's a struggle and it all comes down. And I kind of wished there was two words for ego, right? Cause the ego, if I didn't have an ego driving me to be better, I would just be sitting at home eating chocolate chip cookies on the, on the college. There's not two words to describe you to go, but there is the dichotomy of it though. And so then you're good to go. Yeah. You know, uh, what am I a team guy buddies. A long time ago you could use this phrase, which I, which I always remembered cause I thought it was really good. Basically someone was whining about something and you know, raise their hand and said, well, you know, why are we doing this? And then afterwards my buddy goes, hey, that's cool. Put yourself on report for being a bitch.

Speaker 1:          01:36:00       And so like I've been hypersensitive to that for a real long time. I do not ever, you know, I don't care what I'm broke through, I will not complain about anything. Like I am hypersensitive about that at least I've tried to be. I mean, you know, cold blocking mockups, anything, uh, you know, hurt. Like I hurt my knee and I might need was all swollen up, all jacked up. And I didn't tell anyone. I told her, hey, injured my knee. Nope, no factor. And finally Lafe was like, Hey, you know, what's up with your knee? I sent him a picture, like the knee is just twice as big as the other one. He's like, oh my God, are you going to need surgery? I'm like, no, no factor. But, and I only sent it to him like six or seven days. The swelling had gone down, but out of the gate I wasn't going to say anything cause I don't, I don't want to sit there and complain.

Speaker 1:          01:36:48       Like, Bro, I hurt my knee doing Jujitsu. Oh No. You know what I mean? Like, come on Bro, I'm not going to complain about that. Uh, but yeah, those other things about being resentful and being jealous when ever I feel that tinge of what I feel that tinge of jealousy when I feel that tinge of, when I feel like I feel like mad at someone for doing something, I automatically know it's me. I automatically, and I've known that for years there was a stoner. As a matter of fact, I was going to, he wanted to go to Princeton and he, he said to me, he and he, I wasn't that, we weren't, we weren't together at team three anymore. And so he was talking to some people and finally he comes to me and he says, hey man, I want to go to Princeton. I want to put together this package and go to Princeton.

Speaker 1:          01:37:34       He said, but, uh, some of the other people I'm talking to are telling me it'd be bad for my career. And I'm like, Bro, those guys are just jealous. Uh, that's not happening. I go, you go and you get your freaking degree from Princeton. Are you kidding me? How's that going to be bad for? And he did. He ended up doing it and he had got, he got in, he got accepted. And, but that was one of those things where it was so obvious to me, like whoever told you that is just telling you that cause they don't want you to have, have another punk card to pull on you. Cause like, hey, you're stoner, your, you know, you got a bunch of combat experience, you got a bunch of combat awards. You're, you're this big strapping dude. And by the way, you're going to go to Princeton.

Speaker 1:          01:38:15       Like no one wanted that final punk card to be issued as donor. It's hard when you see someone else that's successful and you know that like I should be getting up off my ass and getting into Princeton myself or going, you know, you can't control whether or not you're deployed to combat there. A lot of that other stuff is, and I think that's where it gets painful for guys. It's like, okay, well I'm not going to make the efforts so I don't want anybody else to make the effort either. I'm a crab in this bucket and I'm going to drag that crab that's trying to climb out back in the bucket and this is actually in a way the warrior kid three this is why I had to address this, which in a way the where your could three you'll have you read it yet.

Speaker 1:          01:38:56       Not yet. That's one way. The where your kid, there's a new character that comes in, his name is Danny Reinhart and he's like good at everything. He's better at mark than ever and everything. He's like a little bit smarter, does better on the tests in school and he's a little bit faster and he can do more pull ups. And then like to take the cake because he's a new kid, moves in and and mark still thinks he's got the ultimate punk card to pull, which is I do Jujitsu and I can choke you. Some of the, most of the stuff matters. It turns out Danny Reinhardt's been trading for two more years and that's exactly what happens is mark, instead of saying, wow, I can learn from you. Wow, you can help me. Wow, that's awesome. I know you worked hard for that. Instead he just tries to undermine and he just is jealous and so that's something that you deal with when you're starting to be, even as a little kid, you know you as even a little kid, you can be jealous.

Speaker 1:          01:39:42       So checking, check yourself if you're being resentful, if you're jealous of someone, those are like the first things I check when I start getting mad at someone. Those are the first things I check when I start getting mad at someone. I go, am I being jealous right now? Yes I am. He didn't say filter is not is not good. And what's worked out really well for me is when you identify these, these people that are good at everything, keep them around you. Oh for sure. For sure. For sure. And that's the other, the other clincher in the way the where you could three is, is Danny Reinhardt. He's not only like better, he's also like a really nice kid and so that makes mark even matter cause everyone wants to be friends with them just cause he's nice. So yeah, you got to watch out for that.

Speaker 1:          01:40:29       Check yourself. Don't get that. I wanted to talk about some leadership mistakes that you've made and I was thinking to myself while I could talk, I could call out Jason for leadership mistakes that he's made that's kind of jacked up if I don't talk about any leadership mistakes that I've made. Now of course I've listed a bunch of leadership's mistakes that I've made in that kind of me of leadership and an extreme ownership. So there's that. But I've got a couple that I thought of and I was trying to think of some broad ones. One of them is when I was in Ramadi, I hate to start off like that when I was in Ramadi, I did not do a as good a job as I should have, you know, go a little bit further to keeping the rest of our community informed as to what was happening and why it was happening.

Speaker 1:          01:41:21       And to be honest with you, the reason I say I'll go further, then I just didn't keep them informed. I wasn't even thinking about it. I wasn't even thinking about it when I got home and one of our good friends said to me, and he was all fired up and he's like, we will read in your, he's like, we read your ars at quarters every day like he every day at trade at, at the time while we were in Ramadi, they were reading the ars, the after action report for the, Hey, they killed nine guys. They killed seven guys in I. That's, you know, I was like, hey, that's awesome. That's cool. I didn't really even think of that. But what I also didn't think of was guys that were saying, Hey, wait a second. What are these guys doing over there? Hey, wait a second.

Speaker 1:          01:42:01       Wait, why are you conducting operations during the daytime? Hey, wait a second. Why are you staying out after you get contacted? Why are you staying in position? Hey, wait a second. Why are you working alongside the conventional forces? Why aren't you doing stuff with just special operations? And I did a bad job of explaining these things to our community as a whole. And even when we got back, I had the opportunity to do it and I, I spread the word to some people and was able to explain to them. But by then some people had already thought, oh, well these guys were just over there. Do we these rogue operations by themselves and they shouldn't have been doing it. So that's, that's one, that's one big one that I wish I would've done a better job. And I just, I just wasn't even paying attention.

Speaker 1:          01:42:48       And you know what, it's like, man. I mean this is my, this is my excuse is my, it's my fault because I was over there and I'm thinking like, Hey, we got an operation tomorrow. I got to, I got, I got two elements going out in the field. I'm not worried about what they're thinking. I just didn't even think of it and I should have. So I don't know if that's an excuse. It's the reason why I didn't think of a way I should have and I was wrong for not doing that. Bandwidth could you've expended on it though in the moment. You know what? If I would have been a little bit smarter and a little bit better, I could have taken 15 minutes to send out an email and say, hey, everyone want to let you know what this op was really like because they're reading the OP sums, right?

Speaker 1:          01:43:29       The optimum is an official document. If I could have supplemented that with, hey guys, Jocko here, I know this one sounds a little bit crazy. Here's what's going on. The Iraqi soldiers that we're working with, they don't have night vision. They have one flashlight per fire team to go out at night with these guys is completely, uh, it doesn't work. And so we got to go out in the daytime with them. And so that's what we're doing. Here's why we're doing it. You know, I could have done it, I could have expended a little bit and I just didn't have the awareness that I should have had to explain these things. Also to explain them in plain English because it's one thing to read the OPSM that's an official document that's written a certain way. It's another thing to say, hey guys, Jocko here, here's what's going on.

Speaker 1:          01:44:13       And cause I mean let's face it at that time I'd been in for a long time and I had friends everywhere. I mean, and when my friends would reach out to me, this is probably should have been my best indicator. Some of my friends that reached out to me and said like, hey dude, what's going on? Like I heard you just got a go. I heard one of you guys got shot. What's going on? How that happening. And I had one specific friend of mine who wrote me like a long email and, and I wrote him back, right. And said, hey man, this is what's going on. But that should have been an indicator. If one of my friends was reaching out to me and saying, Hey, what's going on? I should have been more cognizant of the fact that people beyond, and people that didn't know me at all, you know, would be thinking, well, you know, well this guy's, this guy's a hyper aggressive.

Speaker 1:          01:44:58       And they're just out there taking too many risks. It's like, no. And, and what was cool was there were some guys that were in Ramadi, other seals that were in Ramadi or working in and around Ramadi at the time who I knew and they were like, Oh, you guys are crushing it. You guys are doing great. This is awesome. But I didn't do a good job. So that's, that's one thing. Um, I dunno what it looked like from your perspective. Where were you when I was over there in Pei calm poolside at Thailand explaining to my guys why we had to put the missions first. Yeah, yeah. Check. Check. Yeah. But at the time I was excited for you guys because it was like the, that was like the first sustained heavy combat of that war. Yeah. Everything had been, we were talking about the big news to stand around and talk about when you were at the bar was, was maybe a tick or a firefight that lasted five minutes and you guys were troops in contact 100% of the time.

Speaker 1:          01:45:59       Every time you walked outside the gate. Yeah. It wasn't quite that, but it was a lot. Yeah. And that's for sure. And that's what, that's what I think. I think I should've explained that better than I did throughout the community. And you know, I still talk to guys. I still have the opportunity when it, cause you know, some guys that I'll, I'll still explain this to some guy that I haven't seen cause you know how it is, you run into a guy that you hadn't seen in 15 years, you know, and they'll be like, dude, what were you doing over there? I was like, Hey, let me explain it to you. I've had people sit through kind of the, the Ramadi brief and be like, okay, I get it. I get it. Yeah, that makes sense. Hey Roger. But yeah, should have done a better job of that from a leadership perspective.

Speaker 1:          01:46:37       Um, I was trying to think of a tactical example of, and this is real easy story. One time I personally chase down some dude over like multiple rooftops as a in Baghdad, you know, like just got in a one band pursuit while I had another guy like trailing me. But basically we're hitting a target. There's a squirter I'm outside the building as it's happening. And all of a sudden, you know that the, the overhead asset reports that there's a squirter and he jumped to another rooftop and I had a radio man. The radio man was like near me and we both know the radio man and he's like, hey. He's like, oh, you went to the next roof. And I was like, God, him. And so I climb up a palm tree of a climb up a palm tree, like in between a palm tree and like the garage and I get to the roof and I get in and he's like, you jumped to the next one.

Speaker 1:          01:47:27       And so the radio, the t j tack is in the street with me following down and telling me what's going on. And basically I left my, I shouldn't have done that, you know, I should've sent a couple guys and eventually I got someone else with me and then we got the guy. But you know, I just was trying to think of, hey, where, where did I make some mistakes? Where that were more on a tactical level. And that's one right there is, you know, I, I'm in charge of the assault and if I'm out there chasing the guy from rooftop rooftop, I'm not doing my job. I, but they did have it on video [inaudible] and I tried to get ahold of it, but of course it's classified so I couldn't have it. But yeah, it was pretty cool to watch. You know, you're doing like par core in, in Kit punk.

Speaker 1:          01:48:16       It's called the palm tree and then jump from roof to roof to roof. And then eventually they're like, he said that one right there. And uh, yeah, so that was one. And then the last thing again, I was trying to think of like a variety of different mistakes. And here's something from a leadership perspective that I really, when I look back, I wish I would have done a better job. And that's helping guys with their finances. Young guys, I mean, how many young guys enlist? They get $150,000 reenlistment bonus and they show up at work two days later. They've got a new FordF three 50 super duty Harley Davidson a version. And they have, you know, they're, they have a, they have a $62,000 truck that is now worth, they just had it for a day and they've now worth 48,000. So they already lost money and guys that would rent instead of buy, you know, just all those things were, and I wasn't like super at it, but I was ahead and I should have been telling guys like, Hey man, let me talk to you like, hey guys, let's do a little lips. Was to talk for half an hour about where you're at right now. Let's come up with a strategic objective of where are you going to be and five years, you know, do you still want to be renting an apartment in IB because that's probably not great. Or do you want to be buying a place, get with one of your buddies. So I never talked about that kind of stuff. And again, what it boils down to is my own, my own, uh, being obsessed. Like I didn't care about that stuff. You know what I mean? I guess

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       I cared about it enough to do it. And I got lucky. I had a, I had an officer one time that said I bought a house every three years and kept it. He just said that to me and I was like, that seems like a really good idea. And that's what I tried to do, but I didn't pass that word on and I could have probably helped out more guys. So kind of a bummer on that one. Yeah. Because that aspect, and I completely dropped the ball on that early in my career as well. Later, later on I got a little bit better at it, but you know, cause I did 30, but uh, um, I, I could tell a guy how to be a good shooter. Yeah. But then I didn't look at the whole rest of the Dang pie chart and realize that if I fixed all that other stuff, they'd be an even better shooter.

Speaker 3:          01:50:36       Exponentially better. Right. And Yeah. That, that, that was something that, that actually helping guys, and there were stuff that this is, this is something I really failed at is like, I could see guys messing up, but I didn't want to have that uncomfortable conversation with them to like, Bro, you gotta you to kind of fix this. Like, Hey, you know, you've used the analogy before. If I have a booger hanging out, I want somebody to tell me. Yeah. And so I see get mad at them when he was talking about I wanted that booker there. No, I definitely wouldn't. I had some of those conversations for sure. And I'm sure you did too. Like, hey bro, this girl, she's not the one I'm going to tell you that right now. Uh, this isn't gonna work out well for you. The problem is getting somebody to listen to that conversation is real hard when it comes to the ladies.

Speaker 3:          01:51:32       Yeah. And that aspect of just, most times it blows up in your face and then sometimes you're just like, hey, I realize that maybe I'm going to lose my friendship with you. True. But, uh, I got to tell you this, and later on in my career when I started to, to, to start like struggling with anger issues and that were probably a result of my combat deployments and started to go sit down with a psych and I would see, you know, you were super angry even before I was, I was like probably pretty predisposed to it all. And it just, man, it just turned it up to 11. Right. And, uh, and then I would see myself and other guys and I would tell him, hey man, here's the deal. Here's the psychs number. I want you just to give them a call and you don't have to see him after that, but do me this favor.

Speaker 3:          01:52:27       And some guys that would help and other guys, the guy, I made the effort and they'll come to that conclusion at some point, but it's like some, you know, we got to look out, look out for each other and do the best we can. And that was something that I, you know, missed out on. Uh, I think I probably would have made an awesome platoon chief about the time I was, uh, ops master chief two echelons above it and really realized what that job was. Because as a platoon chief, one of the things that I missed out on was, uh, that the guys are always looking at me to set the example. And so it was one thing during working hours, I could set an example, but if I'm a buffoon out drinking too hard, they're like, you're an idiot. Or they follow your example. They, and they, they'll follow my example and think that this is acceptable behavior.

Speaker 3:          01:53:22       Uh, if, if I'm going to bad mouth my leadership, which is, I'm embarrassed to say it, but it's the stuff that if I didn't, didn't really have my aperture open on the big picture and would complain about the command and then I complain in front of the guys just screwing them over. And I did because they're like, well, he's whining now. I'm going to go ahead and whine. Uh, I had issues where like personally I didn't like the person that I was working directly for and that, that tainted my interaction with that person. I didn't have any relationship with them. And then my whole platoon would suffer because I had a bad relationship with the next guy up just cause I didn't like him. Uh, which is complete weeks off. Yeah. Oh yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:54:15       I was having a conversation with Dave Burke. Good. Guilty. Yeah. And it was, we had, he just quoted me yes. Yesterday I was hanging out with them and the quote was like, whatever, six months ago we were having a conversation and I said something like, Hey Dave, whether I love you or hate you, you won't know either way. And, and he was like, yeah. He's like, well, it kind of freaks me out cause you're super nice to me and now I'd say you could just hate me and don't care. And you know, we laughed about it, but that's exactly right. And that is the truth. Like the guys that I hated never knew it. I mean, to this day they don't know it. And so, I mean, you and I were having a conversation about a couple of people that I obviously don't like at all. They don't know that so, so you've gotta be professional at all, at all times and it's a very small number of people.

Speaker 1:          01:55:18       Most people are pretty cool to me, you know, and most people support what I'm trying to get done. So I'm pretty lucky in that way. But yeah, if you, if you let that out as bad, is there ever really a reason not to be polite? The a very seldom. Yeah. You can politely punch someone in the face. Here's what people would freak out. Here's what, here's what people get all like, oh well, you know, that's what you're talking about, Jocko. You're, you're a kiss ass. It's like, actually, let me tell you what I actually want to do. What I actually want to do is I want to win. What I actually want to do is I want us to have my platoon able to get the support that they need. What I actually want to do is I want to be able to have my platoon and get the support that they need so that we can actually do a better job doing our mission.

Speaker 1:          01:55:57       That's what I'm doing. What I care about is my guys and my mission. That's what I actually care about and if I've got to be polite to someone to make that happen, if I've got to overlook the fact that someone might not be the personality type that I particularly like, I don't care. I don't care. Guess what? I'm going to deal with it. I'm going to accept it. I'm going to absorb whatever kind of crap that they want to throw and I'm going to deal with it. It's fine. Now, do you get into situations where you actually have a bad boss that you have to show? Let's face it, if I'm treating you like a piece of shit and and you or I'm making really bad decisions and all you do is support me and you're a yes man, well your guys are going to lose respect for you.

Speaker 1:          01:56:40       So you, there's times where you have to say, hey listen guys, here's what's going on. I don't agree with everything that the boss says, but you know what? He's the boss right now. And what we're going to do is try. The easiest way, the way for me to get him to make better decisions is if he trusts me. So right now what we're going to do is we're going to kick ass and so suck it up. Quit complaining, we're going to do a great job and I'm going to get a better relationship over him where he will start listening to me and we'll move forward. And by the way, unless we're going to have a mutiny, which we're not going to have, this is the best option. The other option is me to have an antagonistic relationship with the boss, in which case all he's going to do is screw us over.

Speaker 1:          01:57:18       So how do you guys want to play this? You know what I mean? So sometimes you got to be transparent about that stuff and that's fine too. I mean, I've, I've been in situations where I've had to do that where it's like, okay, hey guys, here's what's going on. I know this seems a little bit crazy. I know that the boss may seem like he's making a rash decision on this. Here's what we're going to do. Let's explain his perspective. Here's what the boss is saying. He doesn't want this to happen again. He's tightening the news. He's tightening the bleach way more than I want them to, but guess what? Let's show him that he can let loose on the leash again. Let's get in line. You'll see you've got to have those conversations sometimes, but broadly, I'm going to get along with everybody. Why not?

Speaker 1:          01:57:54       I want to do my mission. I want to take care of my guys. The best way to do that is if I have good relationships up and down the chain of command. Boom. A question. And you know, I don't like you even in secret, the secret is out. Kind of got that either way. In your view, what um, what's the difference between that? How you say like you get along, like even if you don't, if you really don't like someone they will never know in your view. What's the difference between that and being like, oh, what do you call like a to face or you know, I'm like love to say, oh he's a toothpaste person or whatever. One big thing is I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not getting along with them so that I can so that I can uh, better my own life.

Speaker 1:          01:58:34       I'm not doing it so I can take care of me. Yeah. Cause I don't really care about me. I'm doing it so I can do my job well so I can take care of my platoon so I can take care of my team so I can accomplish my mission. That's number one. If I'm doing it so I can get the promotion. I'm actually the guy that I don't like the guy that like, oh, I'm doing this so I can get promoted. No, I'm not doing that. And that's another thing. The troops see through that every single time they have a name for it in the teams. That guy's a ticket puncher. They're trying to get their ticket punched. Oh, he's just trying to get his ticket punch. He's trying to grab onto that guys, grab ahold of that person's coattails and ride him up. You know, ride them up to the next rank.

Speaker 1:          01:59:09       It's like, no, everyone sees through that. If you're doing the right things for the right reasons, people are like, hey, you know what, Jocko European, I mean, and many times people will look, dude, you're your patient guy. Leif Babin told me that, hey, you're so patient, I don't, I don't see how you do. I don't want to see how you do it. You know? This is when he was younger. Like, Bro, how do you deal with that? I care about our task unit. I will make this happen. I can, I can absorb some impacts, no factor, bring it. I remember when I was working the club is a guy who I thought was two faced and when I listen to you like you're like, oh yeah cause he said that'd be four that you like. If you didn't like someone they probably wouldn't know. And I was like, Oh yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

Speaker 1:          01:59:48       You know, cause it like it helps the relationship, helps morale, like health helps all these things. Right. And then so I think, well yeah a face guy, there was a distinct difference and one of the main things on top of what you said because what he said was like, I think it wouldn't work thorough. Ultimately view minus a little bit more. How should I say? Straight forward, ground level I guess. Can I guess what you're going to say? Sure. You can. Well cause the other option, the other answer I was going to give is I'm not acting differently in one situation or I don't go, hey boss. Yes I got it. And then go back to the platoon and go, he's an idiot. No, no, no. I don't do that. I go, Hey boss, I, you know what? And even if it was a situation where I was saying like, I might go back and tell the guys like, hey guys, this is what's going on.

Speaker 1:          02:00:32       I would tell the boss, I wouldn't say boss. That sounds like the greatest plan ever. Yeah, no, I'd say, Hey boss, I'm not, I don't think I'm 100% on board with this. I see some other ways we could get this done. If this is what you're telling me you want me to do, I'm going to make it happen. But I think we could, you know, I'm, I'm going to, I'm so I don't act differently. Yeah, I'm not, I'm not a different person in front of, you know, was I was doing an event the other day and I was like talking to a company and I was backstage talking to CEO and we were just, you know, and all of a sudden, you know, there's like, he's like, hey, it's only another half an hour before you go on, do you need some time? And I was like, no, I don't need any time because the person that's going to walk out on that stage is me and I'm not acting any different way. It's just me. I'm going to, you know, I don't need to get into character. I'm in character. I'm walking around. I mean, this is me. And he was like, oh, that's awesome. So same thing. I don't, when I'm dealing with the boss that I don't like or whatever, I don't show that to anybody. Yeah. I go act differently. But you're also, you're doing a good idea. You're doing a good, you're managing what hills are worth dying on for sure. When you go to your boss, so that

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       you built up that equity with them, no doubt about that. When you need it, you can cash it in. And that's why you have to establish those relationships with them. And that's what I really failed as as a young leader before my aperture started to get opened up, before I got introspective and I started thinking about all this stuff from a big picture.

Speaker 1:          02:02:00       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:02:00       And then my little ego was in the way. Yeah. And, uh, um,

Speaker 1:          02:02:05       okay.

Speaker 3:          02:02:06       You know, if you're not, if you're not the guy that is bitching every time when you do bring something up in a respectful manner, then they're going to at least consider what you have to say. And nine times out of 10, they're actually going to go with them. Oh

Speaker 1:          02:02:19       they're going to go with it. Yeah. That's, that's the, uh, that's the extreme ownership story at the end. It was me sitting around with your task to command to the other tasks and competitors from all the different teams and everyone's, you know, say they got this problem, that problem. The other problem, you know, and the, the commodore at the time who was a friend of mine says, Hey Jocko, what do you need? And I was like, Hey sir, we don't need anything. We're good to go. And you like it. You know, for whatever reason, I was like the last guy to go. So it had even more impact cause everyone was complaining about this thing or the other thing used to lose and he goes, he goes, Jocko, which this that they gave it even more in back cause he's just like, you know, he knows me.

Speaker 1:          02:02:58       He goes, Jocko, what do you need? And I'm like, nothing sir, we're good to go. And you can say, you know, four months later when I go in there and I say, hey sir, we need x. He goes, cool, go to supply. I'm calling them right now. Boom. Taking care of. That's, that's how it should be. Another thing that I was thinking about when you were talking, somebody asked me at some point, you know, which, what point did you start sort of like looking at yourself, kind of what you're talking about. At what point did, did I start to look at myself from an external position and say from a detached perspective and same weight, are you being jealous? Are you being resentful? Are you complaining? I can tell you right now that when I stepped into a leadership position, what I knew was that as you said, every guy in my platoon is looking at me.

Speaker 1:          02:03:50       And I looked at myself the same way I s because as a young enlisted guy, cause my first leadership inside of Mattoon was as an, as an assistant platoon commander. You know, it was an ensign and so sure, I was a little bit, you know, when I was an e five Oh is this, oh is a three platoon e five and are you in a leadership position? You know, a little bit. Sure. But not really a little bit. When I was a platoon ensign, I was thinking the whole time these guys are looking at me just like I used to look at my officer. So if I complained that it's cold or I complained that it's because when my officers used to do that, dude, this sucks. Oh really? I'd be like, I would, I would just, I would, I just fee. I would get furious and that's why, that's when I really started looking at myself and I'll, I'll quite frankly, when I started putting in an officer package as a young enlisted guy and I was like, wait a second, these guys, I want these guys to think that I actually should be in charge.

Speaker 1:          02:04:57       I needed to tighten it up. They're looking at me right now thinking, why does Jocko think he should be an officer? Here's why. Here's, I need to act like I actually deserve this. So that was a real precursor to me looking at myself from the outside saying, man, I know what it's like to be an e five in a platoon looking at the officer going, Oh, you forgot that piece of gear. Did you? And you're in charge of me. You're making more money than me. You're making the decisions tonight on this operation. You didn't bring your handset. Really that's where we're at. I know what that felt like. And so I held myself to a high standard because I didn't, didn't want somebody to be looking at me thinking jock was complaining. He's weak, he's making a, he's, he forgot a piece of gear. He didn't show up on time.

Speaker 1:          02:05:48       He didn't show up on time. You know how many times I was late when I was in the u s navy for 20 years. Zero, zero times late. Zero never wide paranoia, high level of paranoia. Don't want to have guys like when my officers were late and I look at them and think, oh, you can't even show up on time. You're in charge of me. You know, that's a young arrogant kid for sure. Absolutely. That's me. But I, I, I ate that and I held onto it and that's one of the first things that made me, and at some point it turned from this kind of hostility into like, you need to be a better person. You know, if you're going to be in charge. It went from like this attitude that I'm kind of portraying right now of like, oh you suck into like, hey, you need to do a better job.

Speaker 1:          02:06:39       You need to hold yourself to a high standard, you need to be a better person. If you're being charged with these guys, you need to hold the line and you need to elevate that line. So that had, that definitely had a big impact on me. And Bro, if anybody knows this, you do, you knew me when I was at e for 20 years old maniac. Right. And then you, you know, you ran into me what, however many years later and you're like, let me seems a little bit different, you know, not totally different but cause even when I was a young kid I was fired up. Oh yeah. But you know, I had to elevate, had to elevate some. Yeah. That introspection is something that, that I didn't figure out until way later, but I'm sure glad I'm dead cause I think it paid off.

Speaker 1:          02:07:28       It's, that's one of the things, and it's one of those things that, you know, did your dad ever give you any advice? Yeah. So did mine. How much I listened to? This is about the same amount as I listened to my dad. It's one of those things where you're, you just, there's some things that you have that you, it's like you can't be taught Yay, but you, you can use it. Like, someone can't tell you this for some reason. There's somethings that people can't tell you unless you can just completely open your mind and get humble and put your ego in check, which is really hard to do when you're 22 2124 like there's things that I look at and I go, Oh, you know what? I've heard that before. I learned that lesson. I got told that lesson, but I didn't learn it.

Speaker 3:          02:08:15       But it's, you can pick it up pretty Dang quick by by example. And so, you know, how often do you get people asking you, well, how do I get that guy over there to take extreme ownership? Yeah. It's like you do it. That's true. You take extreme ownership and it will be contagious. Yeah. Yeah. Um, and in, in that manner, when people see those modeled behaviors, then it just goes out and it, it goes back to that thing that life talks about. There's no bad teams, there's bad leaders and I've seen groups, seal platoons and seal troops that have brought talented them. Oh, for sure. And then they'll have kind of a, a guy come in that's a tyrant and an egomaniac and that will permeate into everybody the same way as you know, the one all I see that you're talking about that, that I've worked around everywhere that guy goes, he lifts everybody else.

Speaker 3:          02:09:14       Everyone that's around him becomes better by his example. Yeah. Yup. Any other mistakes or major mistakes? You know, it just back to being a, when I was at the troop, senior enlisted advisor over in Afghanistan and we were doing the remain over day operations and there were a lot of my younger guys that didn't understand why we weren't going, why we weren't just going in, hitting a target and coming out during the same cycle of darkness. They felt like that would be more effective. And instead of sitting down with them and explaining to them why we were doing what we were doing, I would just tell him shut up and get out. And you know, hindsight not, not the right thing to do because then they really don't know why they're doing what they're doing. And then there's, there's resentment that's building and then they're just not going to be the most effective at what they've got going on. Man, I wish we could do this whole job over again. We kind of can though. I mean it's, it goes back to the resentment thing and, and another bad, our word is that regret. I've, I've learned like all these Dang mistakes I've made and every big setback that I've

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       experienced in my life, I feel like it's kind of set me up for success through moving forward. So it's Kinda like glacier, you know, every time I've taken like a foot back, I then move forward. Yeah. Three feet. Yeah. Learn from it and press on. What's interesting for me is as I look back at my career now, and I was actually doing this when I was thinking about mistakes, man, and I was actually talking to, uh, Dave Burke, the deal, Dave and like all the things that I talk about all the time now, I did those things. Like when I was a platoon commander, I was doing this stuff. I wasn't, I wasn't as crystallized, but like when I was a task unit commander, boom, I was, this is what I was doing, this is what I was doing. It wasn't like I had it crystallized.

Speaker 1:          02:11:23       It wasn't like I had this like, oh, this is what I had seen enough. And most of it I'd seen, as you just said, through modeling from some good officers and from some bad officers and some good chiefs and some bad chiefs where I'd say, oh, that's all what that I'm going to, hey, why does that guy do that? He always tells me what's going okay, I'm going to always do that. You know, like that kind of thing. It's, but, but like you said, when you get done with the job, you look at it and be like, man, let me just do that one more time cause I will knock this thing out of the park. So when is the moment, do you think for you that you're, the collective light bulb went off and you kind of put a lot of this together, the collective well that, you know, the first FTX is a trade at when you got there.

Speaker 1:          02:12:04       And that was part of it. Like I like my assistant platoon commander in my OIC, um, I was telling him this stuff, you know, I was like, hey man, here's what's going on. Like, Hey, we needed to do this. Hey you, when you go in and brief this guy, you need to be like this, this stuff. I was doing it, but then the next deployment, it was like when I was, you know, when I was working with Lafe and Seth, you know, it was me saying, hey man, come here. And, and you know, those guys would whip out the freaking, uh, the wheel books. You know, like after they realized what was going on, which was like three days into our, our, our task unit, I'd be like, hey, check this out. And Boom, they'd get out and they'd write and they'd write down like, okay, this is what, okay, got it.

Speaker 1:          02:12:51       Yes, that makes sense. And, but as far as actually taking it and crystallizing, I was absolutely my first, the first FTX I went on with [inaudible] and watched it watch a task and you're out there just fall apart and, and, and all I was doing was sitting there thinking, if this was my task unit number one, here's what I'd be doing. And number two, when I got back, I'd be telling the platoon commander this, this, and this. I'd be telling those guys, Hey, this is where you screwed up. And I just was watching it and go, okay, all right. Here. I basically condensed everything that I had told my guys and said, okay, here's what you guys need to do. And that was cover move, simple, prioritize. Next you can decentralize command the answers to so many, the answers to all problems.

Speaker 3:          02:13:35       Oops. Boil down to four things and they all kind of overlap. Yeah, they definitely are intertwined and they overlap. And you do have to throw extreme ownership on there only because,

Speaker 2:          02:13:44       okay.

Speaker 1:          02:13:45       If you don't take ownership of the problems then they're not going to get solved and that is going to hurt you.

Speaker 3:          02:13:51       So yeah. Yeah. At at the muster, JP was saying some stuff that really stuck with me and he said it out at the, at the PT and he's like, hey everybody, we get to be here.

Speaker 2:          02:14:08       Okay,

Speaker 3:          02:14:08       this is an opportunity that you have to be here. And he said that. And I thought, man, that is just an awesome perspective to had. I called him up yesterday, I'm like, Hey I want to talk about this and you know, just fill me on and on what your mindset is. And he goes, yeah, he goes, you don't want to cause, cause when he was at buds, the way he looked at a four mile time Brun which I hated four mile time runs, I just, I would throw up every four mile time run his, his attitude was I get to do this for bile time. Brun so if you take that and you start applying that to everything, heck yeah. They just don't have, there's no room to bitch about a damn thing. You know, I moved through the airport today and I see a guy with no legs and I'm like, man, my life is so good. Both my legs work and, and I shouldn't, I shouldn't have a complaint in the world.

Speaker 1:          02:15:10       One of the, one of the last thing, and we're getting kind of like getting pretty long here, but um, you know, one of the things I w I wanted you to talk about, and I know this isn't really well, it's, I guess it is because as a leader of your family, um, I know that we, we have to, we have to lead our family. Right. And what you, you, you posted something the other day that was legit. Um, I think it was called a promise to my daughter and I was, I just asked if you could bring it in cause I think if, if you don't mind reading that to everyone, I think it's a pretty cool set up of how to take ownership of, of your family and how to, how, what you, what you as a leader and as a dad and as a father and as a husband, what you are putting forth as your goal, as your objective, as your strategy with your daughter. And I thought it was pretty awesome. So if you wouldn't mind reading that, that'd be cool.

Speaker 3:          02:16:12       Absolutely. A promise to my daughter.

Speaker 2:          02:16:16       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:16:16       I will love you always, unconditionally. No matter what. I will not pamper you. This will forge a resilience that will help you conquer all of life's obstacles.

Speaker 2:          02:16:31       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:16:31       I do not intake intent to raise a princess, but rather a warrior with fire in her heart and ice in her veins. In my mind there is nothing you can't do. No job or goal beyond your reach. I will challenge you so that you stand confidently on your own two feet.

Speaker 2:          02:16:55       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:16:55       And I will set the example on how to treat those you love so that when you choose a partner, it will be someone that lifts you up.

Speaker 2:          02:17:04       Fine.

Speaker 3:          02:17:04       I will invest my time and energy in you so that when I am gone, enough memories of me will be with you in your heart to keep forever stand tall with your shoulders back. This world is yours for the taking.

Speaker 4:          02:17:22       Boom. Yeah. That's awesome man. And obviously I would think the same stuff for my son. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:17:32       But

Speaker 4:          02:17:33       well, you'll have to write one a little bit specific to him. Very similar, I'm sure. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's awesome. And uh, that, that's really cool and I'm better, a lot of people will a, listen to it and B, plagiarize it and eh, you know, ab absolutely. Yeah. For their own family. But no, that's awesome man. And um, like I said, we're, we're going pretty long right now, so that's a good place to wrap up. This one. What is this? Now we've done something like seven or eight hours. Seven or eight hours. Awesome. So, uh, echo speaking of,

Speaker 2:          02:18:15       okay.

Speaker 4:          02:18:16       Having a strategy to get to where we want to go to be a little bit better across the board in all aspects. What do you got for us yet? Some tips. Oh, by the way. Yeah, I read that on Instagram if I'm not mistaken. And I considered plagiarizing it please. My daughter. Now I got the confirmation or what do you, what do you guys call it? Cleared hot. Yeah. All right. There you go. And you were right about the, the two phase things when you said, oh, let me guess what you're gonna say. Oh, you're absolutely a hundred percent correct. Cool. Yeah. Like act one way like, hey boss, hey, you know, hates them. Nope. Didn't they? I think you're awesome. Yes. And then right when he leaves, then you know, yeah. You see that guy? Let's see. Okay. Yeah. Go do that. Alcohol last. Yes, we are on the path.

Speaker 4:          02:19:05       Okay, good. Straight. The strategic versus a tactic. Tactical, long game. Short game. I know you've been in new long game picture, small picture, all the same thing. When people ask Echo what's like the big takeaway? I think that's his primary takeaway. Biggest yes. Focusing on the long game, which he's a football so you know, he like thinks the game thing or Super Mario brothers. Well more appropriately is, but you know, as opposed to thinking short game. Yeah. And if you look at your life every day in long game, slash strategic instead of short game, slash tactical, yeah. You're going to end up in a better spot. Yeah. And when I say the biggest, I mean that's the one that applies to like the whole my whole life. There's the other stuff. No complaining. The Allan was, that's a big one. No complaining, no blaming of course. And then, um, resent. I never really had the resent the jealousy thing. That's something I really had kind of entwined. Um, that one to me always felt obvious when I, when I, when I discovered, um, like anger. Like when you're mad, that's like something up with you kinda thing, you know, it's natural, whatever.

Speaker 4:          02:20:21       That's one of the biggest, one of the biggest things I got from doing this podcast is captain plumb seen when they were in the, in the Hanoi Hilton. Yeah and him saying if you were annoyed with your prison bunk mate it was your fault. I was like hit me diamond bullet. Yeah. Right between the eyes. That was extreme ownership. Next level cause always annoyed with that other person. You don't know actually know what. That's my fault. Yeah that was good. When I, when I discovered it was a book I was reading called Mind Games, I mentioned it before and it said small little passage said basically. Um, in a nutshell like when you have anger issues, not to say that when you get mad but it just as if you have anger issues, it has something to do with your self esteem. Like you have low self esteem and that hit me really hard.

Speaker 4:          02:21:10       Like aw man that hit me so hard that I was like man I can never get mad ever again. That's like a reverse psychology on your ego because then your ego is going, not going to turn myself down because I got low self esteem here. Oh yes. Genius. Same thing with the drinking. You, you uh, you put it into words good where kids drinking, right? I ended up figuring out or it being revealed to me that drew, like when you drink, when you have a drink and you want another one and you want another one and your mind and the more you have, the more you sort of want, you can't really stop or whatever. You don't want to stop. It's just your brain tricking you, you know, it's your brain tricky. Like your brain is chemically saying, oh, we need this. Hey, we need this.

Speaker 4:          02:21:44       You know, we need more of whatever you felt like you were getting manipulated. Felt like I was a sucker as you said. And my ego was like, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. I'm not a sucker. I don't care if it's my own brain. I'm not a sucker or whatever. And it was just that easy man that easy to control it. But yes, it is a reverse psychology on your ego. Good. As opposed to regular psychology on your ego, short term and longterm did you get to right? I thought I'm going to use the word reverse reversal reversal that that's a true going to handle the transition negative, negative. I'm saying. Yeah, I'm on the first, uh, long game and short game. Jujitsu is one of those long game short game situations, hundred percent part of the path. Part of the many activities that we're all doing on the path.

Speaker 4:          02:22:29       Jason Gardner got into good shape, uh, easily. So we're exercising, we're doing Jujitsu, we're eating healthy. We're not getting mad at people. We're not showing resentment. We're not complaining various other things. So we'll go over it anyway. Did you do this? What did you do? Did you just said you going to need a g? What gear do we get? Origin G, get it from origin main.com. This is where all their stuff, by the way, is made all in America from the cotton. They grow from the ground all the way to the end, from the dirt to the shirt shirt, all that. Anyway, origin main.com so you get the stones. Yes. American Americana. Yes. Which we are producing right now. We are hiring more people to produce even more so my apologies on it. If you're ordering right now, maybe we don't have your size. We're working at, we're working it hard. We're growing. Yeah. That was good. Some people at the higher appreciate them. They have the 28 inch in seam.

Speaker 4:          02:23:28       Usually I can only get 30 oh, there you go. Boom. Accommodating everybody. Yeah. There's a few guys at the muster who had them on. I was like, I'll hold couple of people crowded, man. It's good. I don't have anybody that, those are the breaks and that's just the life I live. Also, if sweat pants and shirts and whatnot, other stuff on there. Also supplements, supplements, the best kinds of supplements. By the way. There was some, there was some people freaking out on the strawberries that, have you tried to strawberry slayer yet? Yeah. That's just not me. Oh, you don't want, I'm not that kind of strawberry guy. I definitely got some and tried. It didn't work. I'm, I'm a hardcore mint. Chocolate chip and then the vanilla for Mega, you get that vanilla gorilla and throw it inside your, uh, your coffee. That's your sweetener kind of.

Speaker 4:          02:24:15       That's your [inaudible] boom. Dope. Yeah, that was good. Methane. And then that's iris is mixing that in when you, when you drink that in the morning. Like what time? Like right at, right after I PT. And then how long, when do you feel hungry for your next meal? Oh, I don't eat until like one cheering or two o'clock check in. I was just putting it in everything. She's making multiple pancakes, making milk, whatever and smoothies and all that stuff. So we go through quite a bit of milk in our house. Yeah. And the kids love it. Yeah. That's strawberry can make like a, it's like a milk shake. Smoothie hybrid. Here's what I said the other day. If you put in front of me Haagen daas strawberry milkshake. Yes. Right? Sure. Nestle's strawberry quick. Yes. And Strawberry slayer milk and I was going to die in 15 minutes, so we're just going pure satisfaction short.

Speaker 4:          02:25:19       You're short term. The long game is out of the picture. I'm going straight to the strawberries are moke cause that's what tastes the best. That is the taste test, right? No one does a taste test like that. I'm not filling a caveat on there, but the hoggin downs is going to be sugary or the Nestle's Quik is going to give you a sugar. No, we're taking the long game. Totally out the picture. We're going to cure short term tactical taste. Where you at? Strawberry slayer Brigit names awesome too. You know. I agree. Also joint Pete. Pete was trying to like tell me product names and he's like, he's like, and Pete Goes, you know pizza like Mr Creative. Yes. Right. He's like getting to be creative. And he even told me, yeah, yeah. Oh yeah. He'll tell you. He was like, that's his creative stuff, right. So pizza hit me up.

Speaker 4:          02:26:05       He says, so he set up sending me all these, all these things. Strawberry sniper. I'll have to pull out the list. It's so funny. Everything these random military terms. But yeah, don't catch Pete. He gets into these moods. Creativity is just coming out of his coming out of his brain and he'll start hitting me up with texts about strawberry sniper. I'm not ever, I'm not that mad at that man. He had some ones we used to slayer, so when he hears sniper I'm like, oh I see why that was like a distant second one. I'm trying to think of some of the other whack ones that came cause sorry. Yeah, some of them were real funny actually. I texted him, he texted Brian and me, he's texting us all these names and I was like, okay, stop no more. He just started laughing. Yeah. So check that.

Speaker 4:          02:26:54       Yup. Well he's probably had a, he had a pray. A little too much discipline go. Yeah, potentially. Yeah. Yeah. How many discipline go are you on right now? For daily? No. Per Day? Yeah. Just cause I had to get up at 3:00 AM what time did you go to bed? What? 10:10 PM so you're on five hours of sleep, right? Did you sleep on the plane? No. Can you sleep on planes? Yes. I can see sometimes when I was, I was just writing all these notes and you're ready for this. And some, sometimes I can just turn it off, but I wasn't able to sleep on the point. I can sleep on planes, not as well as echo though. Echo gets the world championship belt. We're seeing my plans. We get on a plane, I got to play with them within within 38 seconds. He's asleep. He looks and he puts his sunglasses on.

Speaker 4:          02:27:39       He looks like he's awake, but it's a lie. So yeah, so discipline go. That's a good situation. I take two every morning check. So get up in the morning to discipline, go and then um, joint warfare taking morning and night. Yep. And I noticed a different, how many do you take? I'm taking two in the morning and two at night. And then what's your body weight? Right now? One 16. I take three. I take three. Joint Warfare, three curl oil, mourning three joint wear for three Carrillo night. If I'm, if I got a little little situation going on too, I might, if I'm around, I'll take three during the day. For the lunchtime too. Dang. She just got the infusion infusion situation fusion. That's good man. So that's that. Yeah. Don't forget about the warrior kid milk too. Yeah. For the warrior kits. Yeah. Well, so, all right, well let's, let's talk about it then.

Speaker 4:          02:28:34       What to what in your opinion or you can mock strawberry or strawberry slayer, strawberry slayers. Thicker. It's like a shake. Yeah, I think it actually, I think the way that they are, they are actually suitable for their audience, so that's true. The strawberry, the warrior kid, strawberry milk is just a little bit, a little bit in the lighter we'll say, cause it does have less protein and the one, the adult one is a little bit heavier Gush, a little bit more like that hog and Naas hit her. I just think that, where are you at Theo Vaughn with that hit her or also Jocko white tea. Yes. Very reframed. I'm going to say the light, the nice stuff about it. Very refreshing. Certified Organic pomegranate white tea doesn't sound hardcore, but it can after you dead lifting 8,000 pounds, that is kind of hardcore proven. By the way, Jason Burton or scientifically, you know, you go on about that.

Speaker 4:          02:29:34       What I'm talking about 100% guaranteed. Can I get sued for that? I, you know, maybe I guess if there was some that couldn't hit at 8,000 pound deadlifts, then they might come at me. Yeah, come at me. Burlington. I'll say lift harder. Yeah man. Drink more. You can't. Yeah, you gotta train 'em cause there's no way everyone else is dead lifting a thousand pounds. What's wrong with you, the guy? Yep. Yeah, yeah, it makes sense. Also, we have a store, it's called Jocko store. I think we all know that. This is where you can get rash guards, tee shirts, going to represent discipline equals freedom. Truckers, hats, truckers, hats, beanies, some beanies. That man, I gotta refill the beanies. Go take. So maybe you don't have beatings there. Well, politico never wears hats. So these apparently on no on the bro. Have you even had a cold head before?

Speaker 4:          02:30:21       Yeah, I haven't had a cold head before. Sure. Well depends on what you mean by cold, but you know, yeah, you put the lid on, you know, put the lightweight, put the coldness on the head, and then right when you shave it, like with the, what do you call the, the braiser never the bakery. They say when you bake your head. That's what, that's an expression. Oh yeah. I can get a little nippy, I guess. Kinda cold. Well anyways, the rest of us would like some more beanies online. Yes sir. You got it. And for the summertime, yes sir. No problem. You're up in Maine in the summertime. Yeah. Or you're up in Michigan in the summertime. Yeah. Or you're up in Washington in the summertime. Once the sun goes down. Yeah. You can get that little Chile. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I agree. And that's how it is here too, in my opinion.

Speaker 4:          02:31:06       And you might as well have a beanie that says discipline equals freedom. Yeah. Man. Represent with everything. Also, the hoodies, like I mentioned, lightweight hoodies, lightweight is Jason Guy. I saw you down at the muster. I look good, right? Not Bad. Well thank you. Oh, now we're on the how everyone looks. Wow. Well it's part of the game. They can be part of. Maybe not for you. Uh, aesthetics wise. Right? We got functionality. We have aesthetics. They're not exclusive. Yeah. And you remember I was asking you about the heavyweights cause that's what I but that's what I need up in northeastern Washington on the Canadian border. We all work functionally. You're current. We are working currently at this time so that by the time fall walls rolls around we offer the heaviest of heavyweight hoodies. Yeah, that's the plan. Yes. I'm talking big time. The real deal for free yet where there'll be no doubt in your mind you're like Oh yeah this is a, this is the heaviest Hoodie I've ever heard that putting on five pounds.

Speaker 4:          02:31:59       Yeah. That's what we want to lead. But aesthetics, how let's say, and a factor of 10 is function, right? You don't have to answer this question. You need, you need level 10 functionality obviously aesthetics. What are we, what are you at what number? A seven. That's pretty significant. What do you at zero, zero, straight up. Zero like the like the lightweight. Any anything having to do with fashion? I think. I think you're at a one. That's what I think. You know, if there are some things where I'd be like this looks stupid, therefore I will not wear it so that we are correct. That puts me in a level one. All right. Well how about this? You got, you got three t four t shirts. One green like green, green not oh d green, green, green, one red, one black, one purple. Which one are you choosing? Black. Why looks better, right? Doesn't get dirty as easy. Nah Man.

Speaker 4:          02:33:01       Anyways, punk card boy. Anyway, some women's stuff on there too. It is Jocko store.com this is where he can get stuff to represent. Yeah, check it out like something. Get something. Did you say origin maine.com yes. That's for it. Yes. For the words. Somebody might want somebody that strawberry of course. Man of course. Yes. Also strawberry, slayer, snap like a, like a, like a theme. Like when you say it, it should be like in the background. She goes, strawberry slugger, double bass, drum Yammer, and you could do, could do good. Do, could do good. You railing you, I don't know if I agree with that, but you know named for sure 100% also subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already on iTunes and wherever you get your podcasts and don't forget about the warrior kid podcast. Yes. Which comes out not as frequently as it should.

Speaker 4:          02:33:53       It should step up this summer as time opens up to create and record that particular podcast and then you can get some of that more your kids. So you're friends with Matt, right? Yeah. Up there. Aiden making it on his farm. Irish jokes, Irish show trends.com how do you know him? Through Iris. You come to your farm? Yeah, we were going to buy meat from him. Then when he came to deliver it to you, he swung by and visited us. I was gone that day so I didn't meet him, but him and I have chatted on the phone a whole bunch of times. Awesome. Yeah, he's a firefighter up in Aventura county and he's got a farm as well and his son Aden was a young warrior kid, makes soap so that everyone in the world can stay clean. That's a cool, that's a good soap too by the way.

Speaker 4:          02:34:48       External soap, it's not the decorative, you know the ones that you little neath makes and it's like here, it's not, not even supposed to really use it as a decoration like gift, if you will. Yes. Also we have a youtube channel, the Jocko podcast, youtube channel. This is where you can get the video version. Of course you wanna see what Jason looks like, right? Handsome looking guy. I'd say, Bro, Jocko, what? Just take it easy. Hey Man. Either way, if you are interested in that. We have a youtube channel also some excerpts on there. You know, we'll cut up little excerpts and sometimes echo puts cello music behind him and he puts explosions in them sometimes when I want to enhance them. Maybe, maybe like a certain message that you talk about hits me hard. I say, Hey, let me express this, you know, put some stuff on them.

Speaker 4:          02:35:38       You ever feel like maybe we should just get a couple of cello players in here? No, I don't tap. I don't ever feel like that at all. And you know, I think we should stick with what we're doing. That's my opinion. Here's the thing about youtube though, as far as subscribing, so it doesn't even matter. And you might notice Jay, you spend time on Youtube. Yes. Like, okay, so here's what I learned and observed. If you subscribe to someone on Youtube, it doesn't matter that much. Like their stuff won't show up all the time. Like how you'd expect, you'd think like, Oh, if you subscribed, their stuff is going to sort of show up on your, what do you call it, the home page or whatever. It doesn't so much to do that anyway. When I get an email, every time you post something new, okay, now you're talking, now you're talking because when you subscribe to some money and you do that additional step, you click on the little bell.

Speaker 4:          02:36:26       I think it's like right next to or on the subscribe button or wherever it is right there. If you do that, then you'll get the alert email. You know my alert ever, my alerts actually come onto my phone. They like spring up on that from youtube or for your Junko podcast. Just posted a new video that's from my, from the app. From the Youtube app. From the Youtube app. Yes. Which is pretty cool. Yeah. Yeah. So if you want that, this is what I'm saying. So when you subscribe, it's almost like a half subscribed, not even a half. It's like a quarter subscribed. That's what it is. Cause you're sorta like, oh yeah, I officially sorta subscribed, but you do like, cool. Okay. I think we're not going to let you know a lot of, since he described this is way different. This is different. I'm saying if you want to subscribe and you want to get alerts and you want it to sort of be in your, what do you call it, the feed or whatever, you've got to get the little bell. This is what I'm worried about.

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       Since you're very decentralized, since there's a lot of decentralized command here. Yes. I'm worried that if people don't subscribe, all of a sudden you're just going to start putting the little thing at the end of your enhanced videos that says that says like Sharon's click subscribe, like it shows the little finger. Click subscribe there and if that happens, no, we're going to have a problem. Yes sir. The videos make it centralized real quick, real quick. Well, we're not going to worry about that because I agree with you 100% like share, subscribe. Yeah. Hey, before you watch this video, go down to the bottom line and click subscribe. Now I'm just saying, I'm sure there's some knowing I hate it when I see that, but I'm sure there's some functional, what's the, what's the equivalent of when you meet someone, like what's the equivalent of a, of a human interaction where you say that we, we, that'd be somebody dropping the s bomb.

Speaker 1:          02:38:11       Would it be like that? But it would be like, like, hey, good to meet you. Can I have a pat on the back please? Like, isn't that basically what it is? That's the human interaction equivalent. Like, Hey, nice to meet you. Um, give me your phone and I'm going to index. I'm going to put my phone number in there so I can text you what I'm doing all the time. Yeah, give me a pat on the back. All right, sorry. I know I might figure that out. That's actually a good little analogical annaleigh analogy. I'm like comparison task. Take find the analogy is what I'm saying. Psychological warfare, iTunes, Google play and be three platforms if you want to. If, if you want to wake up call. Yes. Which a lot of people say, can't you make an long? Can't you make an alarm? Can't you make an alarm?

Speaker 1:          02:38:54       Yes, you can use psychological warfare as an alarm. There's a bunch of alarm options there. There's also something on there. If you're, if you're feeling like you want to eat a doughnut or you want to eat a bag of Cheetos. When's the last time you ate a bag of Cheetos? One time I ate a whole bag of Hershey's kisses and this was when I was in the teams. I'm talking to grown man. How big was it back like a black, a good size, like the size of a book, the size, a regular size book. Like it was one of those, it was like six years ago my mom came over to my house and put a whole bag of candy corn. It was around Halloween and every time I walked by it I was stuffing the things in my mouth and pretty soon they're all gone.

Speaker 1:          02:39:32       You like Candy Court there? They're good. I bet I couldn't eat one right now cause I, you know, kind of cut sweet stuff out. And every time I slip I taste something. I'm like, holy cow. The thing I noticed that is with, with Coca-Cola. Oh like I can't even, can't even come close to drinking a coca cola. I haven't, haven't had one, a legit like, hey, I'm going to have a coke and probably 10 or 15 years or something like that. A long time or two. Probably even longer than that. But when I, when I look at them or like the last time I tried to sip when I was like, yeah, they're like syrup. Yeah. So anyways. Yeah to make sense. Like see that? I can drink coke though. So that's psychological warfare. You can get that on any of those platforms. Also, flip side,

Speaker 4:          02:40:14       canvas.com if you want the visual reminder or something. My brother Dakota Meyer has a company called flipside canvas.com and he's making all kinds of cool stuff. He's about to run out some warrior kid stuff too. Some little warrior kid and like his Teddy Roosevelt's definitely, he's just getting after it. So he's making some really cool stuff. Art with layers, by the way. Art with layers. There you go. I like that. You know also on it, if you're expanding your home gym, you're getting more kettlebells, which I did by the way. Darth Vader, how much does it weigh? 70 okay. Here's the thing about the 70 pound like, sure. I'm not, you know, I'm going to be more abreast. What's your hundred pound to Kettlebell that whatever. Bragging to me about one oh six one else. There you go. There you go. One Oh six but the 70 and the 72 the gorilla one or whatever.

Speaker 4:          02:41:05       Those in my opinion, have the most like play universal usage. Yeah. University what you said. Yes. Yeah, those are great. I agree. Yeah. Plus the Darth Vader. I mean, come on man. That's the ultimate one I think, but they should've, they should've made the old, they should've made the dodge Vader like a a hundred at least over a hundred pounds in my opinion. Maybe Jason, you're the star wars expert. Yeah. You should definitely be the heaviest. Who's the most? Who's the most powerful character in star wars? Darth Vader. This doesn't seem like he's kind of a Trump. Some no negative. No. You'd think the emperor may be, but it starts Vader. Darth Vader. Your matching you're about to get. Yeah, I mean, I don't know. You know, Darth Maul was pretty Dang bad ass is like the get chopped up pretty quick. Who would, I mean Darth Vader lost their theater. Lost to Luke Skywalker who cobbled immediately, by the way. Yeah. Later on. Say start the later, man. I think it starts later. Yeah. I like Vader.

Speaker 4:          02:42:07       The real leader lifts people up. You ever see that meme and Darth Vader's holding that [inaudible]. That is so funny, but guy fader went through the whole arc. He was good, bad, good. Boom. You don't know what I'm thinking. Well, I'm sure all the people dog side, unless yes, I got that Kettlebell. There's a lot of good stuff. There's these, there's these electrolyte minerals that are part of my daily daily Manga meetings with the discipline. Nonetheless, go in there on it.com/jocko and check out some stuff on there. Some really good stuff. All right. Some books weigh the warrior kid three. The book is called where there's a will. There's a good message to talked about it already. Check that one out. It is available now also where the warrior kid one and to Mark's mission is to number one his way of the warrior kid. Check those out for your kid to teach your kid these lessons, these lessons that Jason I just talked about for two plus hours are broken down, simplified and,

Speaker 1:          02:43:12       and sprinkled sprinkled throughout these books so that your kid is gonna read when your kid is going to save things to you. Like Dad, I think your, that might be your ego talk. That's so that the idea of ego gets introduced in way the warrior kid three, that's where it gets introduced for the first time. So why? Because I wish somebody would have told me about my ego. I wish somebody would have explained to me that I was resentful. I was jealous. I was, I was

Speaker 2:          02:43:46       okay

Speaker 1:          02:43:46       whining. No one did. Hm. Or if my dad did, I didn't listen cause I was a young punk. So, uh, get those books. Also, if you've got a younger kid, you can get Mikey and the dragons as well. Which again, this is the thing where your kid gets taught a lesson. Hey, I didn't listen to my dad. Oh my, I didn't listen to my mom. Jason didn't listen to his mom. Jason didn't listen to his dad. I've been sitting around with a bunch of like real,

Speaker 2:          02:44:18       okay,

Speaker 1:          02:44:19       really squared away people, business people. And we start talking about kids and, and then I say, Hey, wait a second. Who here? Listen to their parents. No one raises their hands like very few. There's the one occasional to occasional uh, Eddie Haskell's. Do you ever? Yeah. Yeah. I always listen to my heart. No, you didn't liar most mostly, but you, what, what happens is when they hear it from another angle, they listened to it and go, Oh okay, I understand that. And they think it's cool. It's uncle Jake. It, it's not my dad cause your PR, your kids want to rebel against you because they know they have to leave the nest. They got to set up some kind of a barrier. So they need someone to give them advice. Let that someone be uncle Jake, let that someone be the king in Mikey and the dragons. So there you go. That's that also we got obviously disciplinary treat them field manual.

Speaker 2:          02:45:12       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:45:13       If you're an adult and you need to know how to get on a path and stay on the path to just get that book and put it by your bedside and read that. Read a page in the morning. Have you ever had a book that will get you out of bed? No. Okay. Discipline. It was freedom field man. Who put it next to your bed. Yeah. You'll be like, I'm getting out of bed. I'm going to go get some. So then there's extreme ownership in the dichotomy leadership piece. Are there books about leadership written by me and my brother Leif Babin about the lessons that we learned overseas. Now you can apply them in your team, in your business, in your life. Also, we got echelon front leadership consultancy.

Speaker 2:          02:45:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:45:50       And we're very busy. You know why? We're very busy. We're very busy. Because no matter what problem you have in your team, in your business, the problem is a leadership problem. If you want to get it solved, you got to solve the leadership.

Speaker 2:          02:46:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:46:06       The leadership problems that you have and if you can do then n****r solve the problems in your company. So it's me, it's Leif Babin, JP Denelle, Dave Burke, Flynn Cochran, Mike Cirelli, Mike by Ma and Jason Gardner. If you want us to help you go to Ashland, front.com for details. We've got the muster. Chicago's done. Did it sell out? Yes it did. How'd you like the monster as your first monster? Jason? How'd you like it? Wow, that was amazing. Don't you wish you got to go to that when you were 25 years old? Yeah, years old. I was super impressed by it. There were people that had their kids there. Yeah. Yeah. That's not normal or right. It, I mean when you say there was people, there was probably okay. And by, by kids there were, I'm talking to, there was one 13 year old that was there, but there was a quite a few like teenagers and high school age.

Speaker 1:          02:47:05       Yeah. I would say 16 to 21 there'll be, there'll be a good amount, maybe a dozen. Right. And then, but there's, yeah, there was one 13 year old, the warrior kid that was just straight getting after it. He was coming home early morning PT the other way doing it. He didn't mentioned that warrior kid rash card. If you want to get that. Anyways, that's the monster. They always sell out. The next one is in Denver. It's 19th and 20th of September and it's going to sell out to Sydney, Australia, December 4th and fifth it's going to sell out. We've got people in Australia. Yes we do. When I went to Brizzy, there was people from all over Australia coming to hang out home of David Hackworth Brisbane. That's where we moved. Take it. Yeah, and if you want to come to that code, extreme ownership.com get on early. Yeah. If online, if you can't come to the monster or you can't bring your entire company, the muster cause the musters expensive, then get go to ETF online.com and what that is, it's leadership training, but the thing is leadership training is not an inoculation.

Speaker 1:          02:48:17       You can't just go to leadership training one time and then you're like, oh cool, I've got extreme ownership now. I'm good to go. Doesn't work like that. Just like you can't go to ones you did two class or even one week's worth of Jujitsu class, you can't go to a two day Jujitsu seminar now you're good to go. No, you need to keep training. And that's what happens here as well. So you, it's not a, it's not an inoculation. You gotta get it repeatedly and that's what e f online does. Or if you can't make it to the monster, go to [inaudible] dot com and also e f Overwatch, taking proven leaders from Spec ops in combat aviation and putting them in companies in the civilian sector that need leaders that you might think, well, they don't have any experience in my industry. Cool. They'll learn it.

Speaker 1:          02:49:02       That's what we do. Hire for their character, hire for their leadership capability. Then teach them the industry specifics. They'll pick up and they will fill in the leadership holes that are causing you problems and if you want to hear more about nineties TV shows or Super Mario brothers from eco no or you want to hear more about war or leadership from Jason or me than all of us are on the interwebs.
