00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:02.660
There are FIVE U.S. flags sitting on Earth's
moon.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.560
The oldest has been there for a few days shy
of 45 years!

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.560
What happened to them?

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.620
Are they still there?

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:15.390
Are they OKAY?!

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.390
Hello world!

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.620
Trace here for DNews and HAPPY UNITED STATES
INDEPENDENCE DAY!

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.180
Today in 1776 the Declaration of Independence
was adopted and printed.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.490
In the US this means lots of fireworks, food
and flags around the 4th of July.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.220
Which got me thinking about our loneliest
flags... the ones on the moon.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.980
There are six American flags on our Moon,
one from each successful Apollo landing -- 11,

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.649
12, 14, 15, 16, and 17.

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.809
The nylon flags were manufactured by Annin
Flagmakers in New Jersey and cost a whopping

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.210
five dollars and fifty cents at the time.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.010
They were literally the same flag you'd get
off the shelf.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.420
The moon is unownable under the Outer Space
Treaty, so the flag was never meant as a symbol

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.360
that it was conquered by America.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.739
It was purely ceremonial.

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.640
Something to help humanize the achievement
of putting a human on the moon.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.510
On Earth, a flagpole is a pretty simple thing,
but taking one that can be set up on the moon

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.930
took multiple engineers considering everything
from the lunar regolith, to the mobility of

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.810
an astronaut in their suit.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.260
These NASA engineers produced the Lunar Flag
Assembly -- which looks like this[a] -- and

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.310
is essentially a set of interlocking vertical
poles with an attached nylon flag.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.320
As the moon doesn't have an atmosphere, the
engineers added a telescoping curtain-rod-like

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.120
horizontal pole at the top to hold the flag
out.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.939
Astronauts couldn't extend all the way, however,
which is why the flags look rippled in photos.

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:46.180
Without wind or an atmosphere, the flags only
move when something ACTS on them, like when

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.340
the astronauts were setting them up, or when
a rocket blast blows by them.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.740
Buzz Aldrin thought he saw the Apollo 11 flag
fall over during the rocket blast that launched

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.390
them back to meet up with the Command Module...

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:02.290
In 2012, his suspicions were confirmed by
data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter,

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.880
but we'll come back to that.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.820
So assuming the flags are still standing,
what would they look like now?

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.129
These nylon flags were put up and left for
45 years.

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:16.239
FORTY FIVE YEARS OF Alternative 14 days of
sunlight and 212 degree (100C) heat and 14

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.029
days of darkness and negative 238 degree (-150
C) cold.

00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:24.730
Plus bombardment from cosmic and ultraviolet
radiation, micrometeors and charged particles...

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.719
Have you ever left a book or photo in the
sunlight for a while?

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:32.329
Notice how its color fades?

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:35.939
This is the INTENSE version of that, multiplied
by four-and-a-half decades.

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:39.069
The nylon fabric wasn't exactly made to last
forever.

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.340
It just had to look good for the landing ceremony.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:48.959
By 2014, experts say, our flags are at BEST
simply sun-bleached white nylon, and at WORST

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.959
have completely turned to dust.

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.590
The flagpoles are made of anodized aluminum,
so they're doing okay.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.180
Of course, we don't know for sure.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.072
We can't point a telescope at the moon and
check, because the 3-by-5-foot (0.91 by 1.52

00:03:01.072 --> 00:03:02.879
m) flags are just too small to see.

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:07.030
There is a ray of hope -- no pun intended
-- because remember the data for the Lunar

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.159
Reconnaissance Orbiter I mentioned? in 2012,
the LRO pointed its cameras at the Apollo

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:15.370
landing sites to see what condition they were
in.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.949
They could easily see the Lunar Module, but
they ALSO spotted a shadow nearby!

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.169
THE FLAGS!!

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:27.849
At the sites of Apollo 12, 16 and 17 they
could see the shadow of the Lunar Flag Assembly!

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.651
Some of these still cast tiny rectangular
shadows onto the ground, they think, though

00:03:31.651 --> 00:03:35.889
they're not 100-percent sure... again, they're
really small.

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:42.229
So maybe, just maybe, there's some of 'Old
Glory' left clinging to those poles.

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:43.930
Sitting in the silence of our moon.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:44.930
Happy Independence Day everyone!

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:45.930
What do you think?

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.900
Should we send more flags to the moon and
more places?

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.120
Come tell us and thanks for watching, we love
you guys.
