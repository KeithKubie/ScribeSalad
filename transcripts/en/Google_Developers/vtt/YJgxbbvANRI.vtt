00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.760
Thank you so much, Chris.

00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:01.635
And thank you, Sahid.

00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:03.420
Thank you both for
inviting me to speak.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.405
And thanks to all of you for
taking a few minutes to listen.

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:08.280
I think this talk is
going to be a little bit

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.540
different from the ones
we've heard so far,

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.560
but I hope this provides
an interesting perspective.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.234
As Chris mentioned,
I work at Atlassian,

00:00:16.234 --> 00:00:17.650
and I work on the
HipChat product.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.930
I'm the product manager there,
and I've been with that team

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:20.888
for about three months.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.650
HipChat, if you are
not familiar with it,

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.188
is a chat tool built
for your team at work.

00:00:31.188 --> 00:00:32.729
Another way to think
about it is it's

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.270
like IRC, except everybody at
your work is willing to use it,

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.165
instead of just the devs.

00:00:38.165 --> 00:00:40.290
But it's fantastic at
bringing your whole community

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.590
into one place.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.749
You can have persistent chat
rooms for teams, projects,

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:46.540
deploys, bugs, anything
you could think of.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.750
And of course, you can chat
one-on-one with anybody

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.530
on your team.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.400
You can share files, images,
links, and HipChat records

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.820
everything and makes it
searchable and easily findable

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.370
later.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.720
HipChat runs on pretty
much everything.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.320
Of course, we
started on the web,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.350
but we also have Native Clients
for Windows, Mac, and Linux;

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.390
and you get it on
iOS and Android.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.530
So pretty much anywhere
you are at any time,

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.720
you can be in contact with
your team using HipChat.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.840
We found-- and this was
certainly the case with us

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.730
before we discovered HipChat--
that most people at work

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.049
are using some sort
of consumer tool

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:21.590
to communicate with
their colleagues.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.890
I found that I did
this all the time.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.120
So we decided to build
a better solution.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.990
HipChat is built for business,
because your whole team

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.826
is already there.

00:01:31.826 --> 00:01:34.200
There are tens of thousands
of teams around the world who

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.616
are using it to
collaborate today.

00:01:35.616 --> 00:01:39.059
It's the first thing they
sign into in the morning.

00:01:39.059 --> 00:01:41.100
They leave it open on
their desktop all day long.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.110
They converse in it with their
colleagues until they go home,

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.990
and even after.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.400
And it is the heartbeat
of those teams.

00:01:50.662 --> 00:01:52.120
This was certainly
the case for us,

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.810
but we found that
there was a problem.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.545
Any time we found ourselves
moving the conversation outside

00:01:58.545 --> 00:01:59.795
of HipChat, we got frustrated.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.770
It happened over and over again.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.209
So as conversations got longer,
someone would inevitably say,

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:08.750
"well hey, let's
just talk about this

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.640
rather than typing for an hour."

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.880
Then we proceeded to
the negotiation phase.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.730
So do you want to
use a real phone?

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.250
Or how about Skype?

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.950
What about a Hangout over here?

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.575
We could just go to
the conference room

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:23.520
and use a VC system?

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.140
Oh wait, OK, what
room are you in?

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.380
What's your login
on that system?

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.742
I invited you, have
you seen my invitation?

00:02:29.742 --> 00:02:31.700
I don't see you logged
in, let me restart.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.607
So inevitably, it
would take 10 minutes

00:02:33.607 --> 00:02:34.940
to actually get this stuff done.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.670
And by the time you actually
connected with the person

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.262
that you wanted
to talk to, you'd

00:02:38.262 --> 00:02:40.720
forgotten what you wanted to
talk about in the first place.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.760
So that's why we decided
to build HipChat Video.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.000
You can now move a conversation
from text chat to video chat

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.960
with a single click
inside HipChat.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.700
You can do video calls, screen
sharing, and audio calls

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.890
all right within
the application.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.586
And so far, our
customers have loved it.

00:02:58.586 --> 00:03:00.460
So that's really what
I'm here to talk about,

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.640
is how we built HipChat Video.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.310
But here's the
tricky bit, we really

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.410
didn't build very
much of it, actually.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.440
We ended up using a
video provider to power

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.080
all of HipChat
Video, and all we did

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.490
was integrate it
into the application.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.460
We decided that running
a video platform

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.314
was not our core
competency, not where

00:03:21.314 --> 00:03:23.480
we wanted to spend all of
our energy and our effort.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.660
We wanted to build a great
experience, and a great chat

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.670
tool, and a great collaboration
tool, of which video

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.447
was a feature.

00:03:30.447 --> 00:03:32.030
And we weren't
convinced that we could

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.870
do it better than the many great
companies that are starting up

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.380
right now, devoted
to that very problem.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.410
We wanted to take advantage
of what they had done.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.304
So we set out on a
journey about a year ago

00:03:45.304 --> 00:03:46.720
to choose a provider
to work with,

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.900
and to integrate that
feature into our application.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.330
I'm going to talk a little bit
about what we thought about

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.200
as we chose somebody, what we
have discovered as we rolled it

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.840
out, and I'm going to leave you
with a few of the lessons we

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.070
learned.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.810
To start with, the most
important thing, and one

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.610
of the daunting
things that caused

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.610
us to want to work with
a provider to begin with

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.910
was platform support.

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.120
Because we have to work on all
those platforms, native apps,

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.730
all the browsers including
IE, including Safari,

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.019
we knew that vanilla WebRTC
was not going to be enough.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.930
So we found somebody
who could provide us

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.650
a library and the plug-in
for the non-native support

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.470
browsers, and they would extract
away all that difference.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.060
We could program to
one API, no matter

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.340
which browser we were
using, and it worked great.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.120
They use WebRTC
everywhere they can,

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.510
they install a plug-in
where necessary,

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.810
and then I think they
have some fallback methods

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.170
for the very old versions of IE.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.420
In the same way, we weren't
just building for the web,

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.256
we had five other platforms.

00:04:47.256 --> 00:04:48.630
Luckily, we found
a provider that

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.260
provided a library that
supported Mac, Windows,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.280
Linux, and iOS and
Android all natively.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.070
So we had an SDK
for each of those.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.841
They extracted
away a lot of pain

00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:01.340
that we would have
had to go through

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.950
if we were trying to do
this entirely on our own.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.774
That API is actually
the second thing

00:05:06.774 --> 00:05:08.690
that we've thought really
long and hard about.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.110
We actually spent a lot
of time experimenting

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.610
with multiple
providers to make sure

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.560
that they had an API
that was complete,

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.780
that was well documented, that
supported what we wanted to do,

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.090
and that was well supported.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.190
And it was actually
amazing how many people

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.770
failed this simple test.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.760
The features that
we cared about,

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.270
that was obviously another
major consideration.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.407
We've started now with
one-to-one video chat,

00:05:32.407 --> 00:05:34.240
but we know that we
want to go much further.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.561
We want to move to group next,
and broadcast in the future,

00:05:37.561 --> 00:05:39.310
and so we made sure
that we found somebody

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.935
who was heading in
that same direction,

00:05:40.935 --> 00:05:42.950
and provided a lot
of those features.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.791
We looked at how they handle
multi-party, how widely they

00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:47.790
could scale, what technology
they use behind it,

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.870
and there have been
some great explanations

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.092
today about the architectures
that support that.

00:05:53.092 --> 00:05:55.550
We also looked at things like
how they collected analytics,

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:56.929
and could we have them?

00:05:56.929 --> 00:05:58.470
Could we actually
see how things were

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.020
performing inside
our application?

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.790
And quality measures as well.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.590
Fourth, we cared a lot
about user experience.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.600
We were trying to
solve a problem where

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.379
there was a lot of
sort of UX friction.

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:13.920
And so we wanted to
make sure that we

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.470
could make a smooth and
painless an experience

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.830
as possible to make it
feel like 100 percent

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.520
native part of the app.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.020
So it was interesting,
because there

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.130
were a bunch of providers--
maybe not a bunch,

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.713
but there are some
providers-- that we

00:06:26.713 --> 00:06:29.940
looked at that had
a standalone UX.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.570
You couldn't really
modify very much.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.986
Sometimes there was branding
that you couldn't get rid of.

00:06:33.986 --> 00:06:35.800
Sometimes it would
launch a new process.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.850
We found one that we could
integrate wholly into the app,

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:40.670
and as far as our
customers are concerned,

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:45.057
there is no difference between
HipChat and HipChat Video.

00:06:45.057 --> 00:06:46.890
So not every provider
gives you the latitude

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:50.250
that you might want to build
the user interface that

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.980
fits best in your application.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.350
And lastly, we were
looking for a company

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.560
whose primary business
model was providing video

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.620
as a service to us and others.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.180
We were happy to pay for this.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.120
We just wanted to make sure
that our incentives were aligned

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.190
with theirs as a
company, and that we

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:06.898
were going to go down
this road together,

00:07:06.898 --> 00:07:09.150
because you are making
a long-term commitment.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.260
And you want the team
to be responsive,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.370
and fortunately the
folks we worked with

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.760
proved to be very responsive.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.482
So how did it go?

00:07:18.482 --> 00:07:21.002
It worked out fantastically
well from our perspective.

00:07:21.002 --> 00:07:22.460
Once we had selected
a provider, we

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:28.339
had a prototype up and
running in a matter of weeks,

00:07:28.339 --> 00:07:29.880
and it took several
months after that

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.070
to go from prototype to
shipping, But I guarantee you,

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.670
it would have taken possibly
an inordinate magnitude longer

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:39.200
to actually build support
for all five platforms,

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.210
for all the backend,
for multi-party support.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:42.820
That was all stuff
that we just got

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.430
to take advantage of
someone else's great work.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.120
And when we launched, we
supported all those platforms.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.690
All the browsers,
all the native apps,

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:53.100
and all the mobile apps as well.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.141
And that was a fantastic
thing, because of course

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:56.774
video as a feature
in your app, it's

00:07:56.774 --> 00:07:58.440
sort of a network
effects kind of thing.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.356
It's more valuable the
more people I can call.

00:08:00.356 --> 00:08:02.737
So if we had a limit
and say, well, it

00:08:02.737 --> 00:08:05.070
works in the Mac app and the
Windows app, but not in iOS

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:06.580
yet, then you're
automatically sort

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.750
of kneecapping your
feature to begin with.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.840
So launching on all
platforms simultaneously

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:15.410
was really important to
us, and with the partner

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:17.874
we were able to do it.

00:08:17.874 --> 00:08:19.790
So we launched HipChat
Video three months ago,

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.060
as I mentioned,
and user response

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.910
has been really, really good.

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:25.680
So just a few of the
reactions that we've

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.350
seen in that first
week, and since.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:32.600
People are really valuing the
ability to stay within the app,

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.730
to use video in the context
that they already are.

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:41.220
We've had over 150,000
video calls placed

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:46.632
in three months, 2.5 million
minutes of conversations.

00:08:46.632 --> 00:08:48.090
I didn't really
know what to expect

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:48.760
when we launched this thing.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.490
I didn't have an
idea of the scale.

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:53.110
But when I looked this
number up, it blew my mind.

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:55.865
That is a lot of people
talking to each other

00:08:55.865 --> 00:08:57.490
about a lot of really
important things.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:03.219
The average call is
about 15 minutes long,

00:09:03.219 --> 00:09:05.510
and there are plenty of calls
that are an hour or more.

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:08.119
So clearly, people are taking
advantage of this for meetings

00:09:08.119 --> 00:09:10.410
at work, which is sort of
how we were using it as well,

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:11.790
so that makes sense.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:15.410
In HipChat, we are
really doubling down

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:17.760
on this idea of
making great meetings.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.070
We think that having a
tool like this, especially

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:23.390
for distributed teams, can make
meetings more efficient, less

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:28.370
painful, and just more useful by
bringing all your communication

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:30.170
channels into one context.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.905
So that's what we're
thinking about.

00:09:32.905 --> 00:09:33.780
So what did we learn?

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.530
Or what have we learned
so far in the year

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:37.810
or so that we thought
about selecting, and then

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:41.460
building, and then releasing
this feature inside our chat

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.110
application?

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:46.640
Well first, we figured
out that video is actually

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:47.720
really hard in the wild.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.610
And we were insulated
from some of it

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:51.151
because we got to
work with somebody,

00:09:51.151 --> 00:09:53.120
but still there was
all sorts of user error

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.250
that we weren't expecting.

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.230
I mean, we were
all web developers,

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:59.059
and all of a sudden you're
now dealing with hardware.

00:09:59.059 --> 00:10:01.350
It's not complicated hardware,
but it's still hardware,

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:02.724
and it's not
something that I was

00:10:02.724 --> 00:10:04.817
used to ever having to
do as a web developer.

00:10:04.817 --> 00:10:06.400
But you've got to
worry about cameras,

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.816
you've got to worry
about drivers,

00:10:07.816 --> 00:10:09.830
you've got to worry
about the microphone,

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:11.830
you've got to worry about
other applications who

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:13.240
have stolen focus.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:18.547
And these are things that,
no matter what happens,

00:10:18.547 --> 00:10:20.380
the user is going to
blame your application.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:23.110
So we had to work really hard to
try and smooth that experience

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:23.880
out.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.460
And of course, with
video, especially

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:27.210
with peer-to-peer
video like WebRTC,

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:28.668
you're at the mercy
of the network.

00:10:28.668 --> 00:10:31.290
And again, the user doesn't care
what the network looks like,

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:32.370
they just want
the thing to work.

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:34.180
And if it doesn't
work, it's your fault.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:38.710
So that led us to
a second lesson,

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:41.350
which was we had to
monitor everything.

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:44.790
So we want a constantly
updating sense

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:47.825
of how the application is
performing out in the field.

00:10:47.825 --> 00:10:50.200
And so we started looking at
things like calls attempted,

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.870
called completed, calls dropped,
looking at those ratios.

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:55.550
We looked for problem signs,
like repeated short calls

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:58.340
between the same two
people, or lots of drops,

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:00.780
or short calls that were
legitimately hung up.

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:03.250
But if somebody's only on
there for five seconds,

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:04.970
it's probably because
they can't hear

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:06.790
or they can't see or
something like that.

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:09.560
We monitored network quality and
audio quality and video quality

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.980
during the call,
and see how that

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:14.240
changes over time and with load.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.670
And then lastly,
we also made sure

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:19.610
that we asked the users
how things were going.

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:21.402
So this is a pretty
standard UI, but as I'm

00:11:21.402 --> 00:11:23.026
sure you've seen with
many other tools,

00:11:23.026 --> 00:11:25.030
when the call ends
we say, "how was it?

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:26.000
How was the quality?

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.400
Please give us your
one to five rating.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.420
If there's a problem, you
can leave some notes."

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.240
And we track and
record that over time

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.345
as well to make sure
that we're staying

00:11:34.345 --> 00:11:35.470
at a high level of quality.

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:37.678
And fortunately, things have
been pretty good so far.

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:44.854
But thirdly, the
first two lessons

00:11:44.854 --> 00:11:46.395
led to this third
one, which is, it's

00:11:46.395 --> 00:11:49.590
really important to help
users help themselves.

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:53.060
So because the user is going
to blame your tool no matter

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:55.150
what goes wrong, it's
best to give them

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:59.840
as many ways out of a
problem as possible.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.341
So we built in things into the
application like a Test Sound

00:12:02.341 --> 00:12:04.548
button to make sure that
the speakers were turned on,

00:12:04.548 --> 00:12:07.150
or their headset was plugged
in right or working correctly.

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:08.926
Indicators for your
mic, for the camera

00:12:08.926 --> 00:12:11.300
display so you can actually
see what the camera is seeing

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:12.230
to make sure it's
actually working

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:13.634
the way you think it's working.

00:12:13.634 --> 00:12:15.300
And then lastly, we
made sure that there

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.340
was really detailed logging that
a user can turn on and access,

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.552
and give to us if necessary.

00:12:20.552 --> 00:12:22.510
And that's helped our
support guys a whole lot.

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:30.930
So I'll leave you with
three key takeaways

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:33.080
that we pulled out
of this process.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.950
The first is the choice
of Building versus Buying.

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:39.499
And what we asked ourselves
was, was video the core

00:12:39.499 --> 00:12:40.290
of our application?

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:42.829
Was it the most important
thing we were going to build?

00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:44.370
And we decided that
it was a feature,

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:45.950
but it was not the core.

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:47.860
And secondly, we were
not in a position

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.740
that we could invest
to do it differently,

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.260
or better than the
whole ecosystem of you

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.640
guys out there who were
building these services already.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:58.030
So we found a great
partner to work with.

00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:59.680
Secondly, before
you choose, make

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.490
sure you look hard at
the SDK and the API

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:03.830
before you make a commitment.

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:06.440
You're going to be using
that API for a long time,

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.650
make sure it's something
you want to program against.

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:11.650
And lastly, remember that
the real world is messy.

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:15.010
So make it as easy as possible
for your users to self

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:17.440
diagnose, to give
you information,

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:21.250
to help you help them.

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:22.905
So that's how we
built HipChat Video.

00:13:22.905 --> 00:13:24.530
I really appreciate
you guys listening,

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:26.060
and I hope you'll
go check it out.

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:26.560
Thank you.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.110
[APPLAUSE]
