00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's now look at the data set that relates age to wage--how much money you make.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Most of you out there are young, so your preference might be that the world pays

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
young people the best, but in many countries wage goes up with age

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
until perhaps you hit retirement age.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Which one is it? Let's plot the data.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Here is a very elaborate data set of people of certain ages and their wages that they receive.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I want you to make a scatter plot for this data.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You'll realize that the highest wage is $267,000, and I want you read off the scatter plot

00:00:42.000 --> 99:59:59.000
what is the youngest age in this data set where this wage is being realized.
