00:00:00.834 --> 00:00:03.503
Let's talk about my boy,
Scott Pruitt.

00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:05.004
(sighs)

00:00:05.037 --> 00:00:08.241
Now, the left wants you to think
that he's some corrupt grifter

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:10.543
using his role
as head of the EPA

00:00:10.576 --> 00:00:13.146
to milk the government
for every penny it's worth

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:16.416
just because he spends millions
of dollars on personal security

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.419
and takes Black Hawk
helicopter rides to coal mines.

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:22.088
But he's not exploiting
government perks.

00:00:22.121 --> 00:00:24.323
Look at him on his way
to dinner last night.

00:00:24.356 --> 00:00:26.292
(sirens wailing)

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:30.930
Yeah.

00:00:30.963 --> 00:00:32.932
(laughter)

00:00:32.965 --> 00:00:34.967
That's a great car.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.436
Great car.

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.839
Gets negative three miles
to the gallon,

00:00:39.872 --> 00:00:44.444
which is also the EPA's
new fuel efficiency standard.

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:46.712
See, Scott's not the kind of guy

00:00:46.745 --> 00:00:49.749
who uses his office
only for personal gain.

00:00:49.782 --> 00:00:52.618
Sometimes he does it
for his wife.

00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:53.886
A new potential conflict

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:56.722
for the EPA administrator
Scott Pruitt.

00:00:56.755 --> 00:00:58.524
He's now accused
of using a government aide

00:00:58.557 --> 00:01:01.260
to help score his wife
a Chick-fil-A franchise.

00:01:01.293 --> 00:01:03.429
Pruitt had
his taxpayer-funded staff

00:01:03.462 --> 00:01:05.965
ask about a business opportunity
for his wife.

00:01:05.998 --> 00:01:08.167
The idea, according to the Post,
 was for Pruitt's wife

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.436
to operate one
of the restaurant's franchises.

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:14.040
Yes, getting his wife
a Chick-fil-A is adorable.

00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:15.675
(laughter)

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:18.077
We all know
the ten-year anniversary is tin,

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.312
15 is crystal,

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:21.547
and apparently,
25 is mostly white meat

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.117
with a couple pickles.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.820
But just like Chick-fil-A's
evangelical agenda,

00:01:27.853 --> 00:01:29.489
this story keeps going.

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:32.992
The shameless media has been
hounding Scott all month.

00:01:33.025 --> 00:01:36.562
Pruitt ordered thousands
of personalized office supplies.

00:01:36.595 --> 00:01:40.166
That includes
12 silver personalized pens

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:42.935
with the EPA's seal
and Pruitt's signature on them

00:01:42.968 --> 00:01:45.905
for the low, low cost
of more than $1,500.

00:01:45.938 --> 00:01:46.973
Now, that breaks down

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:50.476
to $130 per pen,
believe it or not.

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:51.677
Oh, okay. Okay.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.413
$130 may sound like a lot,

00:01:54.446 --> 00:01:57.383
but these pens write
in crude oil.

00:01:57.416 --> 00:01:59.986
(laughter)

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:02.455
Quill, baby, quill.

00:02:02.488 --> 00:02:04.123
And then there was this.

00:02:04.156 --> 00:02:06.792
Pruitt used his staff,
his official staff,

00:02:06.825 --> 00:02:10.029
to run personal errands
on the taxpayers' dime,

00:02:10.062 --> 00:02:12.465
such as finding him
an apartment to rent

00:02:12.498 --> 00:02:14.667
or personally tour
the properties,

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.868
even to call

00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:18.204
a Trump International Hotel
in Washington

00:02:18.237 --> 00:02:21.641
to see if he could buy
a used mattress.

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:23.743
-Ah.
-(laughter)

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:25.144
Ah, yes.

00:02:25.177 --> 00:02:28.414
The very best adjective
to precede a mattress:

00:02:28.447 --> 00:02:30.683
"used."

00:02:30.716 --> 00:02:32.685
(laughter)

00:02:32.718 --> 00:02:34.520
Followed closely by,

00:02:34.553 --> 00:02:37.223
"You know, your mom and I
actually created you on this."

00:02:37.256 --> 00:02:39.759
(audience groaning)

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:41.861
Now, don't believe the hype.
Don't believe it.

00:02:41.894 --> 00:02:44.230
He's a good man,
not some con artist.

00:02:44.263 --> 00:02:46.499
If he were really
abusing his position,

00:02:46.532 --> 00:02:48.467
he would at least try
to hide it.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.636
This, this is as exposed

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:53.773
as that secretary
who showed ankle to Mike Pence.

00:02:53.806 --> 00:02:56.442
You see, there's something else
going on here

00:02:56.475 --> 00:02:57.810
if you look close enough.

00:02:57.843 --> 00:03:00.179
Chick-fil-A?
That's basic sustenance.

00:03:00.212 --> 00:03:02.782
Mattresses?
Just a place to sleep.

00:03:02.815 --> 00:03:05.985
Pens? Tools to write new laws.

00:03:06.018 --> 00:03:09.021
Scott Pruitt isn't swindling
American taxpayers.

00:03:09.054 --> 00:03:12.258
No, he's creating
a second Earth.

00:03:12.291 --> 00:03:13.859
(laughter)

00:03:13.892 --> 00:03:16.929
Now, sure, he's not done.

00:03:16.962 --> 00:03:19.232
He'll probably add
a form of currency

00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:21.701
and a taxpayer-funded
Moon Porsche,

00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:25.004
but Pruitt is making Earth 2,

00:03:25.037 --> 00:03:27.039
which is good because,
let's face it,

00:03:27.072 --> 00:03:29.141
our planet is getting toasty
for some reason.

00:03:29.174 --> 00:03:30.243
Someone should look into that.
