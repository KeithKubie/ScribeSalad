Now, in the previous example where I had you remember numbers, it was no

00:00:03.055 --> 00:00:07.495
coincidence that I chose seven digits. I chose seven digits because of a

00:00:07.495 --> 00:00:12.446
process called Chunking. It's much easier to remember things in chunks than it

00:00:12.446 --> 00:00:18.782
is in individual units. Here I want you to try this. Remember these letters, D,

00:00:18.782 --> 00:00:37.744
C, V, N, U, D, A, I. Now, count by threes to 30, 3, 6, 9, 12, and so on. Now

00:00:37.744 --> 00:00:40.683
what were the letters I said? Write them here.
