what is why are we assuming that it has
 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:09.649
what is why are we assuming that it has
to well it has to get rid of some waste

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659
to well it has to get rid of some waste
 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.030
to well it has to get rid of some waste
that it doesn't want anymore

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040
that it doesn't want anymore
 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.740
that it doesn't want anymore
well why could could we just turn that

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750
well why could could we just turn that
 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.770
well why could could we just turn that
into more hair instead but why does it

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780
into more hair instead but why does it
 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.839
into more hair instead but why does it
have to get rid of waste like isn't it

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849
have to get rid of waste like isn't it
 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.000
have to get rid of waste like isn't it
possible that we can become so efficient

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010
possible that we can become so efficient
 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.409
possible that we can become so efficient
that we no longer need to get rid of

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:21.419
that we no longer need to get rid of
 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:24.500
that we no longer need to get rid of
waste and we can just sort of exist by

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510
waste and we can just sort of exist by
 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.789
waste and we can just sort of exist by
breathing right here all right

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799
breathing right here all right
 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.640
breathing right here all right
completely just like self yeah we

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650
