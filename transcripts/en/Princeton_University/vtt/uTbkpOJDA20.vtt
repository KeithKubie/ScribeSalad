[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:01.529 --> 00:00:03.820
LUKE GAMBLE: I think the
reason I'll always play tennis

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.300
is because tennis has
really been an instrumental

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.220
part of making me who I am.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.844
And this is where Princeton
has been really special for me,

00:00:11.844 --> 00:00:14.260
just the number of people that
I've gotten to do and share

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.250
this journey with - 
my coaches, my teammates,

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.280
and also just the huge athletic
sort of body and tennis

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.735
has been that for me.

00:00:22.735 --> 00:00:25.940
It's totally shaped my
person, in a way which I'm

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.415
at least really thankful for.

00:00:28.415 --> 00:00:29.790
Being an athlete,
in general, has

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.246
been absolutely central
to my time at Princeton.

00:00:33.246 --> 00:00:37.800
And I think it's extended my
academic environment, as well,

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.371
because you get all this
extra time in a really

00:00:40.371 --> 00:00:42.870
sort of intimate environment
with other student-athletes who

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.410
are also really
smart people, and who

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.180
also care about their studies.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.910
And so it's actually
complemented

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.020
my academic life in a really
cool way, not to mention

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.580
the sort of just sort of
communal element of what

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.180
it means to be a
Princeton athlete.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.650
There's a really good sort of
society and community, I think,

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.210
that we all have
because we're going

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.000
through the same sort of stuff.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.504
BILLY PATE: Luke has probably
grown as much as anybody here,

00:01:07.504 --> 00:01:09.670
and I think he's really
benefited from the Princeton

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.330
experience.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.960
He is a very, very
articulate guy.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.790
He's a voracious reader.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.740
He came here with
the idea he was going

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.366
to do English, and read a lot.

00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:21.740
I remember, his
recruiting visit,

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.073
he was worried he wouldn't
be able to read the things he

00:01:24.073 --> 00:01:26.530
wanted to read on the outside,
because the professors

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.000
would have him reading so much.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.940
But I think he's really done a
good job of utilizing Princeton

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.030
and getting all the resources
out of Princeton for him

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.500
and using it for,
you know, gain later,

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.020
so it's improving his
life, and of course,

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.705
improving it on the team as well.

00:01:43.705 --> 00:01:45.330
LUKE GAMBLE: One of
our favorite things

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.160
to do as a team is
on Friday mornings,

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.660
it's called Reading
with the Tigers.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.130
And we partner with
a local school,

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.171
and it's organized by the
Student Athlete Service

00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:52.830
Council.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.824
And we go and we read with
young kids, elementary students,

00:01:56.824 --> 00:01:58.990
and it's a great way for
us to sort of bond together

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.620
outside the regular academic
or athletic environment

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.270
but still do something
that we think is

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.120
worthwhile with the community.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.310
BILLY PATE: I would say
each head coach here treats

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.850
their players like a family.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.420
So you want to see
them excel, and you

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.940
want to see them come back
for reunions, for alumni

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.060
gatherings you have,
to come to matches

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.820
or where they're on the road.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.590
They'll be all scattered,
probably, across the country,

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.455
and they'll come out
to there to see us.

00:02:23.455 --> 00:02:25.580
And hopefully, they'll take
some life lessons here,

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.890
whether it's from the
University or from our program

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.265
or just learning
from each other,

00:02:29.265 --> 00:02:32.950
because there's a lot to learn
from each guy on the team.
