00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:12.740
When we talk about energy storage,
we're often talking about one thing: the battery.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.440
Try to imagine a world without them.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.740
You'd have no mobile phones, no laptops,
 tablet computers

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.080
or even remotes
for your TV

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:30.820
I think batteries are amazing,
 but they can be very very familiar.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.280
So I wanted to show you an unusual,

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.560
and slightly in fact I think quite scary,

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.020
demonstration of what batteries can do.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.960
So I've rigged this up.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.780
This is an arc welder.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.720
Not something I thought I'd be doing

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.340
It uses electricity to cut through solid metal.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.020
It's one of the most energy intensive
processes you can think of.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.900
The actual tip here can reach
20,000 degrees Celsius

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.140
and that extractor fan there is
going to actually take up the fumes.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.040
But the welder is hooked up to just
a couple of ordinary car batteries

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.700
and come with me
and I'll show you what they look like

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.320
So right here are some two ordinary car
batteries and we've hooked them up.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.980
But we've put them out here because
there's a small chance they might explode.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.940
So let's try and set things up.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.400
So I'm no welder,
I'm just a humble chemist,

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.400
but I'll be happy to give it a go.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.780
So this is my hand in glove,

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.860
and so it's really important
at this stage right

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.600
before I get down here,
so if you can put your goggles on now.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.740
I tried something earlier it wasn't a
fantastic effort

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.100
Right, let's see if that's better than my
first attempt

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.040
Well let's have a look so

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.580
if you look here I tried to do Ri twice.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.200
I don't think I'll give up my day job
and become a welder.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.800
So I would say that's my
abstract period

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.080
and that's my sort of dodgy period.
