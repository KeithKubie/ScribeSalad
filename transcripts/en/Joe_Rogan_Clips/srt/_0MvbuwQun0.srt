1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,670
About the Joe Rogan experience.
All right.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,730
Cut All this out. Right, right,
right, right. Hello Adam.
Hey, thanks for having me,

3
00:00:08,731 --> 00:00:11,640
Jay. Thanks for being here, man. I'm
pretty sure I'm a giant fan of your show.

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,760
I really appreciate that.
The fact that it annoys people to it,

5
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:18,420
really a business people off, that's
the goal pretty much, you know, I mean,

6
00:00:18,421 --> 00:00:20,760
I'm not the kind of person where I'm
like, ah, if you're pissing people off,

7
00:00:20,761 --> 00:00:22,850
you're doing something right.
But there's some truth to it.

8
00:00:22,851 --> 00:00:25,770
There's some truth to that. And also
the way you structured the name, I mean,

9
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:28,140
I don't know if you came up with the
name of it, but Adam ruins everything.

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,260
I think I might have to give that to my,
to my former boss,

11
00:00:31,261 --> 00:00:33,390
Samurai Hsa college humor.
Might've might've, uh,

12
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:35,670
I think we came up with the name together.

13
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:39,670
He might've been the first
person to say it, but uh,
yeah. Thank you. I'm really, I,

14
00:00:39,671 --> 00:00:42,000
yeah, I like let's, you know,
it lets you know that, hey,

15
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:43,350
this is going to know you a little bit,

16
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,590
but like I'm going to be telling you
shit that you don't want to hear that's

17
00:00:46,591 --> 00:00:49,050
going to make everything a
little bit worse, you know?
But at the end of the day,

18
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:51,630
it makes it better. It's an optimistic
show at the end of the day where, sure,

19
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,920
yeah. Yeah. You give him the truth.
I think that, yeah, I mean the, the,

20
00:00:55,921 --> 00:00:59,100
the thesis of the show is that it's always
better to know the truth that it's a

21
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:02,370
momentarily uncomfortable,
but hopefully for most people,

22
00:01:02,371 --> 00:01:03,960
99% of people who watch the show,

23
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,720
it grinds your gears a little bit
to find out something like, oh,

24
00:01:06,721 --> 00:01:08,820
I thought that was true with the ad crap,
you know?

25
00:01:08,821 --> 00:01:11,880
But then at the end we show you why
you're actually better off knowing that

26
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:14,940
thing and you're always better off knowing
the truth and my view in my view as

27
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:16,540
well. Yeah. Is, was there ever,

28
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:19,920
and was there one episode that stands
out as being one that people got the most

29
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:24,570
upset about? Uh, there's
a bunch of 'em. I mean,

30
00:01:24,571 --> 00:01:28,800
people get, people get upset with
us for a lot of different reasons.

31
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:31,590
We did one about how, um, uh,

32
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:36,180
breastfeeding isn't better than
formula feeding. It's a no,

33
00:01:36,181 --> 00:01:39,030
they're both like, formula
feeding is fine, you know,

34
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:43,020
and if the promise formula feeding is
becoming stigmatized, stigmatized now, um,

35
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:46,890
and there's a lot of people who can't
breastfeed or who for medical reasons,

36
00:01:46,891 --> 00:01:50,640
you know, uh, and, uh, uh,
the fact is that for me,

37
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,120
formula is like a scientifically
proven wonderful way to feed a baby.

38
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,910
And if you know someone's
choice or need us to do that,

39
00:01:56,911 --> 00:01:59,180
there's no reason to stigmatize.
And we'd go through all the reasons that,

40
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,590
that that's the case. And yet
people get a little, you know,

41
00:02:01,591 --> 00:02:04,890
there's a lot of people who sort of had
an ideology about that, you know, and, uh,

42
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,140
don't want to hear the truth about it.
Um.
