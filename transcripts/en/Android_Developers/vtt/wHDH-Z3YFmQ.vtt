EMILY PUTZE: As
many of you know,

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.120
hopefully, digital
wellness is a big priority

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.630
for Google this year.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.180
And because
technology is becoming

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.707
a bigger and bigger part
of everyone's lives,

00:00:16.707 --> 00:00:18.540
what we often hear from
users today, though,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.257
is that they want to
find a better way--

00:00:21.257 --> 00:00:23.090
to find a better balance
with the technology

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.923
that they use and love
every day, especially

00:00:24.923 --> 00:00:26.170
with their phones.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.670
So as Play and Android, from a
platform and operating system

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.770
perspective, we
obviously believe

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.040
that it's our responsibility
to build products

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.590
for users that make their
lives easier and better

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.993
and not detract from them.

00:00:37.993 --> 00:00:40.410
As you can imagine, on the
games team, over the past year,

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.910
we've been thinking a lot about
these trends and core values

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.990
at large, especially
in relation to how

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.140
they translate to our work with
game developers in the game

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.580
space.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.130
And what's interesting
about the game space,

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.290
and why I wanted to start
off this panel talking

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.450
about wellness, is that
often, when it comes to games,

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.390
the idea of mindfulness
and sustainability

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.192
can sometimes be at odds.

00:01:01.192 --> 00:01:02.150
Now I want to be clear.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.519
When I talk about
mindfulness, I mean

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.010
mindfulness in terms of more
meaningful user engagement.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.850
And they can often feel at odds.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.370
We're all going
after people's time,

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.860
their money, user mindshare.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.860
But how do you pursue
deep engagement

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.440
without necessarily
causing burnout?

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.100
And how do you pursue more
meaningful monetization

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.697
without necessarily
causing buyer's remorse?

00:01:30.697 --> 00:01:32.280
And how do you do
both of these things

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.380
well while also achieving
your business objectives?

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.260
Obviously, that balance is a
really difficult one to strike.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.590
But when I personally
think about a developer who

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.010
has proven that bottom lines and
mindfulness don't necessarily

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.180
have to be at odds, who
actually intentionally uses

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.150
more meaningful engagement
and more sustainable

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.550
monetization as a
strategy to achieve

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.540
their impressive business
goals, I think of Crowdstar.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.000
So I am very excited to
have a group of people here

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.070
from Crowdstar today who
are going to join me up

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.230
on stage in a second to
tell us a little bit more

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.650
about their approach to gaming
in general, what makes them

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.280
different, and how they believe
these differences have played

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.830
into their success in the
market in recent years

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.710
and helped them build very
healthy and sustainable

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.020
businesses.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.980
OK, let's welcome
them up to the stage.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.652
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:23.652 --> 00:02:24.610
Yeah, it's very bright.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:25.950
CHRIS MCGILL: Very bright.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.325
EMILY PUTZE: OK, well, let's
first do some introductions.

00:02:28.325 --> 00:02:28.850
Chris.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.308
CHRIS MCGILL: Hi,
I'm Chris McGill.

00:02:30.308 --> 00:02:32.472
I'm the general manager
of "Design Home."

00:02:32.472 --> 00:02:33.680
SARAH FUCHS: I'm Sarah Fuchs.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.978
I'm the general manager
of "Covet Fashion."

00:02:35.978 --> 00:02:37.770
EMILY PUTZE: Thank you
guys for joining us.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:38.180
CHRIS MCGILL: It's a pleasure.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.763
EMILY PUTZE: Great,
let's kick it off.

00:02:39.763 --> 00:02:43.190
So creative fashion and
interior design games--

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.040
Chris, will you tell us a little
bit about how you and your team

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.942
approached creating these
games in this space?

00:02:48.942 --> 00:02:50.900
CHRIS MCGILL: I think
the crib notes are really

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.250
about Crowdstar. so Crowdstar,
just quickly, has been

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.830
several different companies.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.080
And in a moment of
desperation, when

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.260
Facebook changed
policies, when they

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.690
were going to run out of
money, sometimes that moment

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.190
of desperation,
about six years ago,

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.200
unleashes you from the rules.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.900
And it was prior to me.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.902
But "Covet Fashion" came about
when they had no time left,

00:03:20.902 --> 00:03:23.360
and they decided to take just
a radical different approach,

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.610
because there was no downside.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.950
And what they did is, instead
of a fail fast game environment,

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.830
they actually looked
for the white space,

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.560
tried to figure out
who is not served,

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.010
and took this crazy chance
of not only creating

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.790
an entertaining game, but one
that could have intrinsic value

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.520
in your life outside the game.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.130
And that's-- you know, "Design
Home" iterated on that.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.710
And it's its own entity.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.340
But it's the same principle
of entertaining people with--

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.710
about the things that
they love, but also

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.750
having a connection
to what you do,

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.640
and how you do it,
and make your life

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.440
more informed
outside of the game.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.905
It's really an app
and a game in one.

00:04:04.905 --> 00:04:06.030
EMILY PUTZE: And it worked.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.510
CHRIS MCGILL: Yeah.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.530
So five years later--

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.697
I mean, Sarah can tell you--

00:04:08.697 --> 00:04:10.990
I mean, "Covet Fashion"
is having its record year,

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.490
you know?

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.964
And "Home" is a
top-30-grossing app.

00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:16.839
EMILY PUTZE: Awesome.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:18.506
Well obviously,
Crowdstar has carved out

00:04:18.506 --> 00:04:20.320
this very interesting
space for itself

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.530
to work in in terms of its
innovative and atypical game

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:24.370
design.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.070
But what is it that you
think makes these games so

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.900
unique and successful?

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.550
Sarah?

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.040
SARAH FUCHS: I think we meet
the players where they are.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.290
I think we have thought
about what women like to do

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.500
and found a way to make that
fun, and make that a game,

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.730
and make that interesting.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.610
And we spend a lot of time
learning about our players.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.130
And I think the more when
we get to know our players,

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.990
and the more we think
about what emotion

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.330
we want our players to
have when they're playing,

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.960
and when they're done playing,
and when they make a purchase,

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.460
we really think
about the experience

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.850
that's valuable for them.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.930
And we want them to come away
with this positive feeling.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.000
And so we use that as
kind of a North Star

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.755
for how we design our games.

00:05:05.755 --> 00:05:08.370
EMILY PUTZE: So its a strong
player-first kind of mentality.

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.640
SARAH FUCHS: Player-first, 100%.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.920
EMILY PUTZE: Another thing
that's really interesting about

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.003
Crowdstar, I think, in
terms of a game-- or sorry,

00:05:14.003 --> 00:05:16.690
about "Covet" and "Design
Home," in terms of games--

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.780
is this intrinsic reward
aspect of your games.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.160
Will you expand upon
that a little bit?

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.550
SARAH FUCHS: Sure, I mean,
we want players to play--

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.435
we don't necessarily use kind of
tried and true game mechanics.

00:05:28.435 --> 00:05:30.040
We are event-based.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.490
And so we provide five
to six events every day.

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.790
And players come in, and they
have a-- well, "Covet Fashion,"

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.860
they have a model
that they dress.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.240
And then they get voted on.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.520
And they get to enjoy
the rewards from that.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.930
So we don't have, necessarily,
extrinsic rewards for them.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.780
They come back, and they are
passionate about what they do.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.370
EMILY PUTZE: And one thing
that has stuck with me in some

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.740
of our conversations is that
your players are actually

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.028
happier when they're
done playing "Covet"

00:05:56.028 --> 00:05:57.070
or playing "Design Home."

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.510
That's pretty
unusual, I would say.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.010
CHRIS MCGILL: Yeah,
there's actually

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.020
a study that shows,
a year later,

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.908
in "Covet Fashion," that women
are happier, because it's a--

00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:08.450
you don't put yourself
into the game.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.338
It's not about you, or
your body, or your face.

00:06:11.338 --> 00:06:13.880
You actually get to learn what
you like, what you don't like.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.680
And a year later, when you
step out of your house,

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.935
whether you're going on
a date, a job interview,

00:06:17.935 --> 00:06:19.310
or out with your
girlfriends, you

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.036
feel a little more
confident about yourself.

00:06:22.036 --> 00:06:27.347
So we try to be additive
to our players' lives.

00:06:27.347 --> 00:06:29.180
SARAH FUCHS: And we try
to measure that too.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.680
I mean, you can't
measure happiness.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.545
That's impossible.

00:06:31.545 --> 00:06:33.920
If we could do that, that
would be like the secret sauce.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.930
But we do try to
engage with our players

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.043
as often as we possibly
can to understand

00:06:38.043 --> 00:06:38.960
what makes them happy.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.880
We send random surveys--

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.085
how did you like this challenge?

00:06:43.085 --> 00:06:44.750
We poll them at random times.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.790
We have a style council
on "Covet Fashion"

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:51.430
that has 25,000 players that
we talk to on a regular basis.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:52.460
We make videos for them.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.690
We give them feedback.

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:55.500
We give them exclusive access.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.430
And we really want to
take what our players have

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.143
to say and make sure that
we're delivering the experience

00:07:01.143 --> 00:07:02.060
that's right for them.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.750
CHRIS MCGILL: Right, It's a
balance of heave, heavy quant,

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:10.138
but also tied in
with a lot of qual.

00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:12.680
EMILY PUTZE: So obviously, this
user-centric kind of strategy

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.852
is something that you've
stayed very tied to.

00:07:14.852 --> 00:07:17.060
I think you've said these
businesses kind of grew out

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.977
of seizing the white
space that was available.

00:07:18.977 --> 00:07:22.550
But you've clearly stayed
very tied to your players.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.130
How much has that continued
to drive the growth

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:27.027
and evolution of these games?

00:07:27.027 --> 00:07:28.610
CHRIS MCGILL: I think
it's everything.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:29.110
EMILY PUTZE: Good.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:30.740
CHRIS MCGILL: I mean, it's the
reason why we get out of bed.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.340
I mean, we have to have a
love affair with our users.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.560
Like, we have to understand
them quantitatively in the game.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.080
We have to understand them
qualitatively in the game,

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.490
but also in their lives.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.227
And the idea is-- we actually
write down the emotions

00:07:43.227 --> 00:07:44.810
that we want you to
feel when you play

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:48.320
the game, but also the emotions
you want to feel when you close

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.930
the game so that you're not
just entertained, but just

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.880
then find, an hour
later, you close the app

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.650
and you're another hour older.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:58.745
SARAH FUCHS: Exactly right.

00:07:58.745 --> 00:07:59.973
I love it.

00:07:59.973 --> 00:08:01.640
EMILY PUTZE: OK, so
using user sentiment

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.220
to guide game design
obviously makes sense.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.220
But as you mentioned,
Sarah, it's really tricky.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.340
SARAH FUCHS: Yeah.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:08.270
EMILY PUTZE: How
do you guys balance

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:10.010
between optimizing
for user sentiment

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:13.460
against optimizing for key
business KPIs like engagement

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:14.650
or revenue?

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:15.900
CHRIS MCGILL: You do this one.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.210
SARAH FUCHS: OK.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:20.210
So obviously, we're
thinking about KPIs.

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:21.890
But when we're
designing a new feature,

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:26.033
we'll make sure we stop and
think, is this a retention KPI?

00:08:26.033 --> 00:08:27.200
Is this a retention feature?

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.880
Is this an engagement feature?

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.048
Is this a revenue feature?

00:08:30.048 --> 00:08:31.340
And we really think about that.

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.559
And often, we are in
the midst of designing

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:37.370
this fantastic engagement
feature that's coming soon,

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:40.002
but as we're designing,
we think, oh my gosh,

00:08:40.002 --> 00:08:41.960
we could totally monetize
the crap out of this.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.513
And we could totally
make money here.

00:08:43.513 --> 00:08:44.930
And then we're
like, you guys, no,

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:46.180
that's not what this is about.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.660
We want to engage our players.

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.470
It's about the long game for us.

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:51.530
It's not about
that instant buck.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:53.070
Like, we could have
a sale tomorrow

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:54.860
and have a million-dollar day.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:58.530
But the hangover for that
would be so just not worth it.

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:02.870
So we really think about the
long game for our players

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:04.490
and get-- and breath--

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:08.180
as many players as we possibly
can paying a little bit,

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.035
but enjoying their time.

00:09:10.035 --> 00:09:12.410
CHRIS MCGILL: And that is how
to maximize revenue for us.

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:13.202
I mean, that is it.

00:09:13.202 --> 00:09:14.785
It's not like, oh,
altruism, you know?

00:09:14.785 --> 00:09:16.577
SARAH FUCHS: We're
still about the revenue.

00:09:16.577 --> 00:09:18.300
CHRIS MCGILL: Yeah,
it's a business,

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.560
But it's a question of, we're
trying to build a platform,

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:25.590
a long-standing platform
that never wears out.

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:29.320
And so it's a matter of what
you do and when you do it.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.140
And these are--

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.723
I mean, we have these fights all
the time, though, internally.

00:09:32.723 --> 00:09:33.832
EMILY PUTZE: What fights?

00:09:33.832 --> 00:09:35.080
SARAH FUCHS: Oh, we
have knock-down--

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:35.910
EMILY PUTZE: Tell
us about the fights.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:36.600
SARAH FUCHS: --knock-down,
drag-out fights.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.060
CHRIS MCGILL: Not me, Sarah.

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:38.020
SARAH FUCHS: Oh, no.

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:38.520
I'd win.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.370
EMILY PUTZE: No, but
seriously, what are these--

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:41.640
I'm assuming the
debate's about--

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.765
CHRIS MCGILL: It's really
what we're talking about.

00:09:43.765 --> 00:09:46.010
It's like, OK, well, we
could put in this feature.

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:48.860
And we know we leave
money on the table--

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.200
short-term money-- every
day in the interest

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.430
of long-term money.

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:57.140
And that's the balance that
we have to argue about,

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:58.840
in a healthy way, every day.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.430
We're like, OK, we
know, this month, we

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:03.140
can make an extra $2 million.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:07.100
But that's going to lead
to retention issues.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.740
And that's actually not
going to enrich their lives.

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.470
And we also make sure--

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:15.530
I mean, the stat that
I'm most proud of

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:18.560
is actually the percentage
of our payer base.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:23.210
So every day, we have a
million women in the game.

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:27.050
And at any given point, 40% of
them have been a payer, right?

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:33.170
So it's about having a
broad and engaged audience

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:35.330
that doesn't pay a ton.

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.710
We're like the anti-whale
hunters, right?

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:39.710
SARAH FUCHS: And we don't
like the term "whale."

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:40.490
CHRIS MCGILL: No.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:41.900
SARAH FUCHS: We don't
use the term "whale"

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:43.750
except to say we don't
use the term "whale."

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:45.020
CHRIS MCGILL: Right.

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:46.265
I'm sorry I said "whale."

00:10:46.265 --> 00:10:47.570
SARAH FUCHS: Thank you.

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:49.790
EMILY PUTZE: So it sounds
like, from a monetization

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:50.630
perspective--

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:52.220
I want to dive into the
engagement perspective

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.553
piece in a second, about
something that Chris just said.

00:10:54.553 --> 00:10:56.160
But from a monetization
perspective,

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.520
it sounds like your North
Star is getting users

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.590
to pay small amounts over time.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:03.810
So there's a consistency
aspect with that.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.888
So more is not necessarily
better is what I'm hearing.

00:11:06.888 --> 00:11:08.180
SARAH FUCHS: Correct, I think--

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.010
sorry, I'll take this,
and you can jump in.

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:12.650
Chris, you often
say we can't make

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:14.090
our payers play more than--

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.190
pay more than $10 a day.

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:17.650
It's really hard to do that.

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:19.580
And for us it's
about more people

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:23.450
engaging than one
person paying $100,000.

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:24.483
EMILY PUTZE: Right.

00:11:24.483 --> 00:11:26.150
CHRIS MCGILL: It's
that combined with we

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:29.660
actually make sure that
they'll play too long.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:35.180
We published-- well, "Covet,"
six, "Home," five live ops

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:36.800
challenges a day
that take, typically,

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.890
10 minutes to complete.

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:41.730
And we space them out
throughout the day.

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:42.590
So you can't even--

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:45.560
if you play them all, you can't
play more than one at a time.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.660
And then we actually
tell you to go away.

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:48.970
Get back to your life.

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:50.810
There will be another
challenge, you know?

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.240
EMILY PUTZE: In some way,
you're capping engagement.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.657
SARAH FUCHS: We
want to leave them

00:11:54.657 --> 00:11:56.147
with more, that
feeling of, oh, I

00:11:56.147 --> 00:11:57.980
want to do more, rather
than, oh, I'm bored,

00:11:57.980 --> 00:11:59.563
I'm going to stop
for-- or I'm bored--

00:11:59.563 --> 00:12:01.620
or I have to stop because
of something else.

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:04.610
We want them to want to
come back, and be excited

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:08.540
for their challenge results, and
be excited for the next thing.

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:11.360
We have a great relationship
with our community on "Covet."

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.800
And I have players
who've told me

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.750
they have timers for when they
know the next event is going

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:16.250
to start.

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:17.042
EMILY PUTZE: Right.

00:12:17.042 --> 00:12:18.680
SARAH FUCHS: And
I'm like, oh, OK.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:19.650
I love that.

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:20.390
That's great.

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:22.562
But there's that
feeling of wanting more.

00:12:22.562 --> 00:12:23.270
EMILY PUTZE: Yep.

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:24.920
And I know you guys
said a lot of this

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.320
is a little bit--
are a little bit

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.770
science in terms of
constantly balancing

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:31.730
the qual and the quant.

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:35.690
Have you ever experimented
on doing more challenges?

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:38.880
And if so, what happened?

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.000
EMILY PUTZE: Yes,
and we still do.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.210
I mean, sometimes we'll run a
bonus challenge and stuff still

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:45.030
today.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:48.385
But also, when "Covet" was
being iterated on, they--

00:12:51.295 --> 00:12:53.450
and it's actually
before my time--

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:55.490
they iterated on
many, many challenges,

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:59.160
like eight, nine, 10 a day.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.650
And they settled on six.

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:05.340
And that was some
science and some art,

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:08.640
because they didn't have
the long-term retention

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:09.780
data at that point.

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:15.900
But it's just what felt right
to them in play testing.

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.540
And it was a little-- also
a little bit of an accident.

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:22.440
Because they also would run
out these 10 and realize,

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.180
holy crap, we don't
have enough people

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.450
to make more at that time.

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:27.630
I mean, we do now.

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:29.850
And it just is a nice rhythm.

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:35.160
And they also space them out
so that it's like a snack

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.930
throughout your day.

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:39.730
It's relevant to you no matter
where you live in the globe.

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:46.080
There's something
happening when you get up.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.070
And we talk about it.

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:50.310
Like, we could run out many,
many, many more challenges

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:54.540
per day now, but
we don't want to.

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:57.060
And this is just-- you know,
it's a little-- it's atypical

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:57.630
game design.

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:58.690
It's not for everybody.

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:00.450
But this is what's
working for us.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:01.910
EMILY PUTZE: Right, makes sense.

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:03.910
So would it be fair to
say that, in general, you

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:06.960
optimize these
games for the masses

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.977
versus your top 20% of players?

00:14:08.977 --> 00:14:10.060
CHRIS MCGILL: Absolutely--

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:10.830
SARAH FUCHS: 100%

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:12.163
CHRIS MCGILL: --without a doubt.

00:14:12.163 --> 00:14:16.155
Like, we want a broad, broad
player base and payer base.

00:14:16.155 --> 00:14:18.673
Because if you take out--

00:14:18.673 --> 00:14:21.090
if you delight a user to the
point where they want to take

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:26.040
out $2, %5, they're more
invested in the game.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.410
You've proven something to them.

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:31.860
But we don't get up
to take out thousands

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:33.170
of dollars out of if you--

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:36.193
it it's about a broad,
invested player base.

00:14:36.193 --> 00:14:37.610
EMILY PUTZE: And
so in that sense.

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:38.460
SARAH FUCHS: Yeah, I
was just going to say,

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:39.877
I can give you an
example of that.

00:14:39.877 --> 00:14:42.360
So in "Covet Fashion," we
have these hair accessories

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.590
that everybody wants.

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:45.660
And from time to time,
we do these $4.99 hair

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:47.340
accessory sales.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.920
And we did one $0.99 one.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:54.300
And we found that we made
more money with the $4.99 one,

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.000
but more players bought
with a $0.99 one.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.890
So we're sticking
with the $0.99 one.

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:02.400
Because we want more players
to convert, and engage, and buy

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.522
more things later.

00:15:03.522 --> 00:15:04.980
CHRIS MCGILL: Yeah,
what we know is

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:07.510
that's actually monetizing
revenue over the long run,

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:08.010
right?

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:11.107
Because those people have
known invested $0.99,

00:15:11.107 --> 00:15:12.690
they're more invested
in the platform.

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:16.890
The hair accessories did
not work for me, by the way.

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:18.710
So that's just, like,
the way we roll.

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:20.070
EMILY PUTZE: Totally.

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:22.020
Let's get some of those
for him in "Covet."

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:23.395
SARAH FUCHS: Oh,
yes, definitely.

00:15:23.395 --> 00:15:25.017
The bald is beautiful.

00:15:25.017 --> 00:15:26.850
CHRIS MCGILL: You know,
we did have a bald--

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:28.205
SARAH FUCHS: We do, yeah.

00:15:28.205 --> 00:15:30.330
EMILY PUTZE: So Sarah,
something that you just said

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:32.700
is interesting.

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:36.030
When you are thinking about
making product decisions--

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:39.290
so the scenario you just
described with the $4.99 versus

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:42.420
$0.99, it sounds like you
guys would even make changes

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:45.450
in the game if it was
revenue-neutral, let's say,

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:48.858
if it increased your payer--
if the payer footprint--

00:15:48.858 --> 00:15:49.650
SARAH FUCHS: We do.

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:50.733
And you know, that's not--

00:15:50.733 --> 00:15:53.100
I come from a more
traditional gaming background.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:57.070
It was a bit of a mind
shift for me switching.

00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:58.793
But there are-- we
do have arguments.

00:15:58.793 --> 00:15:59.460
We have debates.

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:02.670
We say, you know, but we
could make all of this money.

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.495
But then we also
think, but hey, we

00:16:04.495 --> 00:16:06.870
could keep-- we could get all
these players who will then

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:08.500
make more money for
us in the long run.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.320
So it is about revenue.

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:14.010
It's just about being mindful
that we don't need to make--

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:15.570
to have a million-dollar day.

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:18.660
We'd rather have many players
play so that we can make more

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:19.650
in the end.

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:21.570
CHRIS MCGILL: Right, so you can
have a $50-plus-million-dollar

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:21.840
year.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:22.310
EMILY PUTZE: Exactly.

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.670
CHRIS MCGILL: Right.

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:23.420
EMILY PUTZE: Right

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.050
SARAH FUCHS: Exactly.

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:28.380
EMILY PUTZE: So how do you think
about retaining-- we've just

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:30.510
said, when users play
into the game, that

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:32.010
means they're probably
more invested in the game,

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:33.990
they spend more time in
it So you're actually,

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:36.240
from a monetization
perspective, still optimizing

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.660
for what-- it sounds like
long-term engagement.

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:41.190
But how do you think
about retaining users

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:44.025
in the game that don't
want to spend dollars?

00:16:44.025 --> 00:16:46.650
SARAH FUCHS: So we have a lot of
different ways that payers who

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:47.950
don't--

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:50.580
so sorry, that players
who don't pay can advance.

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:52.620
We have rewarding video ads.

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:54.720
We have offer walls.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.970
But in "Covet," we
also have gifting.

00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:00.450
We have these runway
rallies where you

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:01.915
play within your fashion house.

00:17:01.915 --> 00:17:04.290
And there are a lot of different
ways to progress faster.

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:06.190
You don't have to pay.

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:08.670
And in fact, we have a large
percentage that don't pay,

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:11.940
and still enjoy, and still
have advanced to level 66,

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:13.680
and are very happy.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.430
CHRIS MCGILL: Yeah,
"Home's" the same way.

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:19.750
And we have a borrowing capacity
if you bring a friend in,

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:20.550
the same tools.

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:22.290
And we have a daily gift.

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:25.890
You just can't play
either as much,

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:32.260
or maybe do as high-quality
a design as you might like.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.490
You really have to
make that decision.

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:35.670
EMILY PUTZE: Yeah, and it sounds
like one of the advantages

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:36.750
that you guys have
is that, because you

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:38.750
have such a broad payer
base, you don't actually

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:41.910
feel the pressure to
design the game in a way

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:44.520
that it's more focused towards
the top 20% of your users.

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.310
You actually can
keep it very open.

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:49.660
CHRIS MCGILL: Yes,
and on top of that,

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:52.290
if you actually look
at this audience,

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:54.150
and it's an older
female audience,

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:56.680
it's also a different approach.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.800
It's not a zero-sum game.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.950
It's a positive-sum game.

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:08.760
And it's not about
creating a competition

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.860
where there's stress.

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:14.490
And these games are
about creativity,

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:16.733
and relaxation, and inspiration.

00:18:16.733 --> 00:18:18.150
I mean, people
call it Pinterest--

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:19.363
The Game, you know?

00:18:19.363 --> 00:18:21.030
SARAH FUCHS: But we
do think about that.

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:24.150
I mean, back in January,
"Covet" ran an experiment

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:25.740
where we loosened
our restrictions,

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:28.050
the things that you had to
do to enter a challenge.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:30.008
And we're like-- everybody's
like, oh no, we're

00:18:30.008 --> 00:18:31.980
going to not make
money-- panic attack.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:33.730
But "Design Home"
was doing so well,

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:35.520
we had a little bit
of a cushion to be

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.770
able to try these experiments.

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:39.480
And we loosened
our restrictions,

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.280
and engagement went up.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.780
Revenue stayed the same.

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:46.950
So that engagement piece, I
can't emphasize it enough.

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:50.997
And there's fear associated
with not doing these things.

00:18:50.997 --> 00:18:53.580
And it's fortunate that we did
have the "Design Home" cushion.

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:55.200
Thank you, Chris.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.200
But we were able to
run these experiments.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.440
And we were able to really
see that engagement matters.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.690
EMILY PUTZE: How do you guys
manage against short-term

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:06.350
pressure internally
to think about--

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:09.510
I'm sorry, pressure internally--
to think about short-term KPIs

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:14.240
and not prioritize those over
this ideal long-term state.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.900
SARAH FUCHS: I think
it's a struggle.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:20.810
I think that it's a mind shift
that we work through every day.

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:22.280
Because there is
certain pressure

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.260
to maintain certain
KPIs to hit our goals.

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.620
But what we have
done has worked.

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:31.480
And the more we continue to
prove that this works, the more

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.230
leeway we're going to
have to able to say,

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:35.640
back off, this is
how we're doing it.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.450
CHRIS MCGILL: I think we have
a luxury that other people may

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:42.020
not have when you go do this.

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:44.540
Because this does work.

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:46.550
It does maximize the
yield under the curve.

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:49.080
Like, I'm super convinced of it.

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.046
The great thing about--
for us is that we have--

00:19:52.046 --> 00:19:54.540
"Fashion" has a five-year
track record of doing this.

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:56.490
They're going to have their
record year in the fifth year,

00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:57.865
I don't know of
another game that

00:19:57.865 --> 00:20:00.170
had their record year in
their fifth year, you know?

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:03.020
So mostly, when we
get pressure, we

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:06.180
can just sort of point at
our track record and say,

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:07.650
this is what we're doing.

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:09.710
I'm not going to say
that works every time.

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:10.730
EMILY PUTZE: Sure.

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:12.518
How closely do you
guys work together

00:20:12.518 --> 00:20:14.060
even though you're
on separate games?

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:15.977
Like, how closely do
"Covet" and "Design Home"

00:20:15.977 --> 00:20:18.890
work together, learn from each
other, lend each other money?

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:20.765
SARAH FUCHS: I'll start,
and you fin-- oh, we

00:20:20.765 --> 00:20:22.190
lend each other money.

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:26.070
You know, I've only been with
Crowdstar for almost a year.

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:29.750
And I look to Chris and
the "Design Home" team

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:32.100
for advice and
feedback all the time.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.700
I think that "Covet's"
a five-year-old product.

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.320
So "Design Home"
was really built

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.875
on the back of what
"Covet" was and took

00:20:38.875 --> 00:20:40.250
a lot of great
learnings from it.

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:42.500
But the teams work
together all the time.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:45.110
We have the "Design
Home" content team

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:47.668
and the "Covet" content
team working together,

00:20:47.668 --> 00:20:48.710
learning from each other.

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:51.242
So I think we really rely
heavily on each other.

00:20:51.242 --> 00:20:53.450
We have Judy out there,
who's our director of product

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:55.460
management, who works
for "Design Home,"

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:57.410
but who I talk to
all the time, and who

00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:00.522
offers amazing,
relevant, helpful advice.

00:21:00.522 --> 00:21:02.480
CHRIS MCGILL: Yeah, and
the truth is I actually

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.020
started on "Covet Fashion."

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:05.730
I ran BD in "Covet Fashion."

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:06.832
I hadn't been in games.

00:21:06.832 --> 00:21:08.540
It was like drinking
through a fire hose,

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:10.880
definitely changed the
way I looked at the world.

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.770
But you know, "Fashion"
is our mother.

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:15.610
We are built on her shoulders.

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:19.700
You know, she fed us while
we developed the game.

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:21.542
We took everything
that we liked about it,

00:21:21.542 --> 00:21:23.000
and we obviously
took our own take.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.030
We have a different
kind of economy.

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:29.700
But the two games are
totally intertwined.

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:34.310
And we like each.

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:36.520
We like having brown
bag lunches and talking

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.180
about what's working,
what's not working, and why,

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:41.922
and lending resources
when we need to.

00:21:41.922 --> 00:21:44.380
SARAH FUCHS: I think that's
one important thing about this.

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:46.820
I've been working in
games for 19 years.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:49.310
And Crowdstar is one of
the first places I've ever

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:53.540
truly felt completely
supported, like with

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:56.265
an absolute family-like
environment where you can say,

00:21:56.265 --> 00:21:58.640
hey, this is what I want to
do, and you're not running it

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.530
up the chain 150 times.

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:02.610
You're actually just
like, OK, we trust you.

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:03.340
We believe you.

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:04.250
Go for it.

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:07.372
But the Crowdstar
feeling is very familial.

00:22:07.372 --> 00:22:08.580
We really support each other.

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:10.040
We really care about each other.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.392
And you know, I'm all about
"Design Home's" success.

00:22:12.392 --> 00:22:14.850
CHRIS MCGILL: It's not like we
don't have family squabbles.

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:17.600
SARAH FUCHS: Oh, we do,
no question about that.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.683
But I think it speaks
to what the game is

00:22:20.683 --> 00:22:22.100
when you have a
team that's really

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:23.143
supportive of each other.

00:22:23.143 --> 00:22:24.810
EMILY PUTZE: Yeah, I
think that's right.

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:26.602
And you have different
experience sets too.

00:22:26.602 --> 00:22:29.570
I mean, Sarah, I am interested
in learning a little bit more--

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:31.375
because of your
background in gaming,

00:22:31.375 --> 00:22:33.500
you've mentioned that you
had to have this big mind

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:37.963
shift when you came to "Covet."

00:22:37.963 --> 00:22:40.130
One of the first times I
met Chris, I said you know,

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:41.630
it would be so great--
because I'm obviously

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:43.380
coming from a
gaming perspective--

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:45.650
if there were timers, or
there was some gotcha,

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:46.790
or add this and this.

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:47.332
And he said--

00:22:47.332 --> 00:22:48.665
CHRIS MCGILL: Over my dead body.

00:22:48.665 --> 00:22:50.990
EMILY PUTZE: --no, no,
no, no, that's not for us.

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:53.780
And so how drastic was
that mind shift for you

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:55.220
coming from the gaming world?

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:56.630
SARAH FUCHS: Extremely drastic.

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:59.870
I mean, gotcha, and timers,
and things like that work.

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:00.810
They make money.

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:02.240
They make revenue.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:06.590
And I come from mobile gaming
when it was in its infancy.

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:08.090
And those are the
things that work.

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:10.040
But we have a different
kind of audience.

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.420
We have a different
kind of game.

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:14.150
We're really toeing the
line between game and app.

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:17.073
And it's important for us--
and it was a shock for me.

00:23:17.073 --> 00:23:18.740
It was like, OK, I
have to unlearn this.

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:20.900
I came in bubbling
with all these ideas.

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:21.830
And Chris and I--

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:23.210
in one of our first
meetings, I was like, Chris,

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:24.752
we could do this,
and this, and this.

00:23:24.752 --> 00:23:27.090
And he was like,
slow down there.

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:28.070
Hang on.

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:29.090
Your ideas are great.

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:32.270
And we're not
going to do gotcha.

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:35.420
But I think it's
something that--

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:36.740
it's not the only way.

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:38.240
I think that there
are a lot of ways

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.753
to have a successful product.

00:23:39.753 --> 00:23:42.170
CHRIS MCGILL: It actually
speaks to a lot of our qual, OK?

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:44.930
So we have quant
coming out of our ears.

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:45.740
And we have--

00:23:48.335 --> 00:23:49.460
Judy's sitting right there.

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.850
Judy is the smartest person
on the planet, right?

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:55.400
And we are definitely
run by our data.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.540
There's no question about it.

00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:59.960
But what our qual said
is, what women love,

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:03.500
what our users love
about us, is that--

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.750
we actually divide them into
four different-- actually

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:08.090
in your case, six-- six
different player types

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:09.960
and what's important to them.

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.910
And you know what's
important to all of them?

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:17.220
No stress, relaxation,
creativity, inspiration.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:20.610
So everything we do--
like when we say, OK,

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:22.510
we can make a million
dollars this month--

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:24.520
OK, well does it add stress?

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:25.880
Is it inspiring?

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:26.520
Is it creative?

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:29.820
Because if it isn't,
it doesn't go.

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:31.100
It just doesn't go.

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:34.563
If it is, great, let's do it.

00:24:34.563 --> 00:24:35.730
EMILY PUTZE: That's amazing.

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:37.740
That's really unusual to be able
to stick to your user values

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:38.040
like that.

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:38.325
And I--

00:24:38.325 --> 00:24:39.370
CHRIS MCGILL: Well, but it's--

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:40.330
SARAH FUCHS: It's the
core of who we are.

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:41.663
CHRIS MCGILL: It's the business.

00:24:41.663 --> 00:24:43.620
It works for the business.

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:46.610
It's not altruism, It's
really good business.

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:47.495
EMILY PUTZE: Yeah.

00:24:47.495 --> 00:24:48.870
One question I
wanted to ask you,

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:50.160
because it's
something that I think

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.260
is interesting for the style
of games you guys make,

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:53.968
and because my colleague
Moonlit, I know,

00:24:53.968 --> 00:24:55.380
talked about this earlier--

00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:57.797
one of the things we're seeing
in the games industry right

00:24:57.797 --> 00:25:00.203
now is an increase in
exploring subscriptions.

00:25:00.203 --> 00:25:02.370
So is subscription something
that you guys have ever

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:03.330
thought about offering?

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:05.790
Or do you have opinions
about subscriptions

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:07.720
in mobile games in general?

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.780
SARAH FUCHS: So I can't
speak to the past, what

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:10.770
they've thought about before.

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:12.660
But we're definitely
thinking about subscriptions.

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:14.493
I think that there were
a lot of great talks

00:25:14.493 --> 00:25:16.800
earlier this morning.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.450
I think that we need to think
about them in a different way.

00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:21.410
We definitely are--
in fact, I have

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:23.160
a meeting about this this week.

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.290
But we need to think about
how they work for "Covet

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:26.760
Fashion" and "Design Home."

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.530
Because what works
for one type of game

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:29.970
is not necessarily
going to work.

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:32.178
But I think subscriptions
has a ton of possibilities.

00:25:32.178 --> 00:25:34.860
I think there are ways we
could explore it, maybe,

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:38.118
with in-real-life stuff
tied into our products.

00:25:38.118 --> 00:25:39.660
So I don't know what
that looks like.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.520
I think there's just
a great future for it.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.590
CHRIS MCGILL: We were
just kibitzing over here

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:44.730
while Moonlit was talking.

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:46.870
We were like, OK,
maybe we need to think

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:48.120
about this in a different way.

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:51.540
And maybe there's something that
we, as a very different entity,

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:55.380
can bring to the table
that takes those elements

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:57.730
but also adds other
elements into it.

00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:00.510
And it's frightening at
first, to think about it,

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:02.133
like ooh, I got a good business.

00:26:02.133 --> 00:26:03.300
I don't want to cannibal it.

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:04.450
And you're like
don't screw it up.

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:05.200
Don't screw it up.

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.150
Don't screw it up.

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:08.800
But we are a company
that takes chances.

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:12.540
And I think we might talk
about a unique take on it.

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:14.610
SARAH FUCHS: Nice use
of the word "kibitzing."

00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:16.442
That was great.

00:26:16.442 --> 00:26:18.900
EMILY PUTZE: OK, let's switch
gears and do lightning round,

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:21.900
because I think we have
a couple minutes left.

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:27.150
But I have some good questions
that I have stored here.

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:29.110
So lightning round-- ready?

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:31.380
I wish I could limit your
answers to, like, words--

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:32.640
like three words each--
to make it harder.

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:33.090
But let's not do that.

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:33.300
CHRIS MCGILL: Green.

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:33.870
SARAH FUCHS: Three words each

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:35.037
EMILY PUTZE: No, no, please.

00:26:35.037 --> 00:26:36.270
SARAH FUCHS: Green.

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:37.603
CHRIS MCGILL: I said that first.

00:26:37.603 --> 00:26:40.320
EMILY PUTZE: What year
will "Design Home"

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:44.040
have its first AR,
integration, if ever?

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.993
CHRIS MCGILL: Next year,
in selective settings.

00:26:47.993 --> 00:26:48.660
EMILY PUTZE: OK.

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:53.340
How many games will
Crowdstar have live in 2021?

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:56.130
SARAH FUCHS: More than three.

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:58.980
EMILY PUTZE: What's one thing
you wish you knew a year ago

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:01.490
and subsequently
did differently?

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:02.740
CHRIS MCGILL: This one's easy.

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:07.080
I wish I'd put more energy and
more focus into recruiting.

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:10.500
Because we're growing
really quickly.

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.705
And it's really hard
sometimes, especially when

00:27:12.705 --> 00:27:15.960
you're doing live ops, to
lay down the track right

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.190
before the train goes over it.

00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:20.760
And if any Unity engineers
are in the crowd,

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:21.690
meet me at the bar.

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:25.517
SARAH FUCHS: Analysts too.

00:27:25.517 --> 00:27:26.710
EMILY PUTZE: Analysts?

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:28.810
CHRIS MCGILL: Just
about anybody, actually.

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:30.442
EMILY PUTZE: Sarah,
what about you?

00:27:30.442 --> 00:27:31.900
Same question-- so
what's one thing

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:34.805
you wish you knew a year ago
that you would do differently?

00:27:34.805 --> 00:27:36.430
SARAH FUCHS: You
know, it's hard for me

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:38.347
to say-- to have a
different answer than that.

00:27:38.347 --> 00:27:43.150
But I wish that we had done
our "Covet Fashion" personas

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:44.020
earlier.

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:47.110
So I wish that we had been
able to really deep dive

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:50.320
on who our players are
earlier than we did.

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.030
Because we're having
a record year.

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:54.430
It's incredible.

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:56.490
And I think if we knew
then what we know now,

00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:58.990
we could have-- last year could
have been a record year too.

00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:00.820
EMILY PUTZE: Awesome.

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:02.890
Name another game
developer that you admire.

00:28:04.995 --> 00:28:05.870
SARAH FUCHS: Network.

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:11.570
CHRIS MCGILL: I admire, I think,
Playworks for their success

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:15.620
and Roblox for their innovation.

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:18.110
EMILY PUTZE: Have you
or anyone you know ever

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:20.872
bought furniture out
of "Design Home?"

00:28:20.872 --> 00:28:21.580
SARAH FUCHS: Yes.

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:24.425
CHRIS MCGILL: Yes,
including my wife.

00:28:24.425 --> 00:28:26.300
EMILY PUTZE: What about
clothes from "Covet?"

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.160
SARAH FUCHS: Yes,
including myself.

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.303
EMILY PUTZE: All right.

00:28:29.303 --> 00:28:31.345
SARAH FUCHS: It's great
when you go into a store,

00:28:31.345 --> 00:28:33.470
and you're like,
that's our brand.

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:34.435
And then you buy it.

00:28:34.435 --> 00:28:35.775
EMILY PUTZE: That's true.

00:28:35.775 --> 00:28:37.880
It's useful, learning,
part of the hook.

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.070
SARAH FUCHS: Exactly

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:41.060
EMILY PUTZE: OK,
parting advice--

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:43.670
Chris, if you could offer
other game developers

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:45.800
one piece of advice
when it comes

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:50.540
to how they approach new game
design, what would that be?

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:52.850
CHRIS MCGILL: I think it's
write a value proposition.

00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:55.730
I think games universally
try to solve the value

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:58.820
proposition of I'm bored.

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:02.030
But if you can entertain
people and tie it intrinsically

00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:06.350
to their life outside the
game, that's defensible.

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:08.040
That's totally different.

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.310
It's additive.

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:10.690
It may not be curing cancer.

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:12.680
It might not be Mother
Teresa's work, right?

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:15.550
But it is additive, it's not
what other people are doing,

00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:19.830
and you're competing
on a different plane.

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:22.493
EMILY PUTZE: Sarah,
knowing what you know now,

00:29:22.493 --> 00:29:23.910
for game developers
who are trying

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:26.070
to pursue more meaningful
engagement or more

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:28.800
sustainable
monetization strategies,

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.062
do you have any tactical advice?

00:29:31.062 --> 00:29:33.270
SARAH FUCHS: Create a
relationship with your players,

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:34.687
people who actually
play the game.

00:29:34.687 --> 00:29:37.187
Think about the emotions you
want them to have while they're

00:29:37.187 --> 00:29:38.880
playing, and as Chris
said, the emotion

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.980
you want them to have when
they put the game down.

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:42.960
And have that be
your North Star.

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.995
And focus on that
relationship with the player.

00:29:44.995 --> 00:29:46.620
CHRIS MCGILL: And
that can be measured.

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:49.405
I mean, it can be
measured qualitatively.

00:29:49.405 --> 00:29:50.530
EMILY PUTZE: Well, awesome.

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:53.990
Thank you guys so much for
doing this with me today.

00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:56.907
I hope everyone feels like
they learned something.

00:29:56.907 --> 00:29:57.865
SARAH FUCHS: Thank you.

00:29:57.865 --> 00:29:59.657
CHRIS MCGILL: I have
one more thing to say.

00:29:59.657 --> 00:30:01.420
What I really like
about it is we're

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:03.220
doing something very different.

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.860
And it's clear to me,
Emily and Moonlit,

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.590
that you have gotten
what we've done.

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:10.420
You've been a champion for this.

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:12.318
And it's the best.

00:30:12.318 --> 00:30:14.110
EMILY PUTZE: I think
it's important to show

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:16.600
that you can be different
and extremely successful.

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.610
And so thank you so much
for joining us today.

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:19.610
CHRIS MCGILL: Thank you.

00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:20.568
SARAH FUCHS: Thank you.

00:30:20.568 --> 00:30:23.320
