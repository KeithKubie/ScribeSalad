00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
I have a tendency to not speak up in conversations when I feel uncomfortable.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.800
Like, sometimes I'll be talking to someone and they'll say something that's just a little... off.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.280
"Oh my god, you know what I wish we could do?

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.080
I wish we could just kill off all the homeless people."

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.740
"Right? Like that would be the best solution for them. It's like, they don't have homes. Nobody's gonna miss them!"

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.220
Or inappropriate.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.120
"It's just like so hard being a straight white dude these days, man. You're so lucky you're a minority.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.060
Like, you'd stand out."

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.780
Or sometimes, just pretty stupid.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.980
"I don't want to break up, I just want to

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.810
like move out, but like we can still go

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.669
on dates, it's just that like, I don't want to have to

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.430
devote every night to you. It's basically like,

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.440
like I want my cake, and I want to eat it too,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.300
and then I want to take a piece home and then

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.550
put it in the freezer for later so I can bust it out and put like

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.820
chocolate fudge and strawberries and some skittles on there, and then

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.530
have it with a glass of wine while I like

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.079
binge a new series." But lately, I feel like I have

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.500
no fucks left at all, like normally when you

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.270
have a fuck to give, you distribute that.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.720
Right?  Like you care about what people

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.280
think, and you try to act accordingly.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.060
I think I'm all out. Exhibit A, the other day, at a bar,

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.060
this guy said, "Oh, excuse me doll."

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.140
Without even missing a beat, I immediately responded:

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.640
"Oh, no worries doll."

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.460
Yeah, normally, would never do that.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.960
I didn't even think about it, I didn't even

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.450
blink. Exhibit B, at lunch,

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.640
my friend said, "Dude, I fucking hate that

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.880
bitch." Oh no. Normally, I would let

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.400
that pass because it's awkward, I don't want to address it.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.580
But since I have no fucks left...

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.440
"Dude, you are so harsh on women."

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.460
"Yeah, well whatever. She cheated on me."

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.160
"So?  You cheated on her too!

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.660
And it was like four years ago!"

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.640
Let it go, man.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.909
And don't get me wrong, I'm not

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.760
saying that I just want to like speak my mind

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.680
with no filter whatsoever. I think that

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.200
my default is trying to be "nice" to avoid

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.090
awkwardness, and instead I want to focus

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.520
on being kind. Whether I'm being kind to

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.829
myself for voicing my opinion when I

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.380
think this conversation is weird, or kind

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.119
to the other person because maybe they legit

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.189
don't realize how weird it is for

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.899
them to suggest that we kill all

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.610
homeless people.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.619
This isn't the Hunger Games. Why are you

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.180
suggesting mass murder of a bunch of

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.590
people who are probably the majority of them

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.110
are mentally ill or

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.420
have substance abuse problems. And I encourage you

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.860
to ask yourself, like what would you say

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.210
if you weren't afraid of rocking the

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.800
boat, and instead committed to actually

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.270
voicing the opinions that you have in a

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.820
conversation. Or maybe you're a person who is

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.070
never afraid to say anything at all. Maybe

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.180
that gets you into trouble. Let me know.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.920
I'm Anna Akana, stay awesome Gotham.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.500
I just want to say, thank you so much to Squarespace

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.050
for like sponsoring today's episode. It's not like I

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.490
don't like you anymore,

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.890
it's just that like with Squarespace,

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.260
they have all these beautiful and like award

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.540
winning templates on their all-in-one

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.130
platform, which means I never have to like

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.900
install, patch or upgrade like ever.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.910
Plus it's like you're not really emotionally

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.800
available, but if I send Squarespace a text

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.440
at 3 am and I'm like, "Hey baby, are you up?" They're like, "Yes,

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.600
we are." Because their customer service is 24/7.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.690
Like wow. Not to mention if I like

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.300
need a new domain name or something, they give

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.250
me like a really unique and like simple setup

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.890
experience, which is like really nice of

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.170
them. So if I like want to make a website for

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.760
like my modeling career, or if I want to

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.260
make a website for my photographing career.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.600
I can do like either of those all on

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.989
Squarespace. So, I mean. I'm gonna go get a free

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.910
trial with them at squarespace.com and use

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.530
the offer code "Anna" for 10%

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.170
off. But like I still really love you, but

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.940
I think it's better if we just both go to

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.769
Squarespace and use the offer code Anna

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.440
for 10% off for first purchases.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.140
I still want to be friends, though.
