00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.629
Before I introduce our speaker for tonight, I'd like to remind you all that today 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.159
we actually did something that as physicists hadn't been done ever

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:31.020
and that's bang neutrons together very high energy

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:39.030
and we have a couple of the physicists that are involved in the experiments are here, and my Associate Dean who is a physicist, Elliott Cheu,

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.030
we should congratulate him because he's one of those that built one of the detectors.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.640
So a funny thing happened to me on the way here. actually.  

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.719
somebody gave me a piece of paper that sort of sounds 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.210
like a plant.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.540
This gentleman which I don't know can stand up and say that he wasn't a plant. 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.460
He has some thoughts and questions.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.650
He has some questions that up he would me to answer.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.750
He asked the question will there be additional lectures this summer or this fall.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.440
Of course for this lecture series there is one more lecture next week 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.290
that has to do with ethics and our brain.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.380
Then it says in here, Can you direct us to new information resulting in ongoing 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.510
university research?

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.150
Are there journals or University publications that we need to have subscriptions to?

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.270
And will there be future lectures on age dementia and how to slow down its process?

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.470
The reason I say it's sort of like a plant is because starting next week on the third (of April) 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:52.470
in fact, were opening Flandrau Planetarium again.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.010
The Flandrau Planetarium will be the portal of science and technology to all of you 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.390
to all of us

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.280
So what we need 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.390
from anybody that's interested are these two things.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.850
To make sure that you do sign up on those papers that they give when coming into the

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.789
Centennial Hall 

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:16.649
so that we can send you information

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:18.609
of this sort.

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:23.000
Flandrau will have a web site which will be sending out information to anybody about exciting

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:26.339
things that we're doing at the University of Arizona

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:30.469
and I hope that you will allow us to send you this information so that you can 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:31.439
join us with 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:35.979
the exciting opportunities and we'll have Flandrau. The Planetarium will be open 

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:39.150
we have a beautiful mineral collection showing right now

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.220
but this will be changing continuously and importantly
0:02:43:000,0:02:45.750
the web site will be sending you information of theist sort.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.229
Thanks for the questions.

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:56.939
Again, I would like to thank our underwriters for this lecture series, 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:58.749
The Arizona Daily Star, Cox Communications, 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:02.379
Bob Davis, Galileo Circle, Godat Design, 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:07.649
Thomas and Cande Grogan, Raytheon, Research Corp for Science Advancement, UniSource Energy.

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:14.649
Without their support we would be charging all of you. [applause]

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.989
So we've heard in this lecture series about the brain a little bit. how it's all wired, the plasticity of the brain. 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.129
We've heard a little bit about how children learn, 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:31.370
We had lecture in which we we figured out  

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.109
how we are wired because of evolution.

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:38.939
Today I am really excited to have Al Kaszniak, who is the 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:39.400
department head

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.919
in Psychology, 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:44.189
tell us a little bit about metamemory.

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:49.319
Al Kaszniak received his Ph.D. in clinical and developmental psychology from the University of Illinois

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.469
in 1976 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:53.330
and he completed an internship in clinical  

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.430
psychology at Rush Medical Center in Chicago.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.139
He is currently head of the department, as I mentioned, 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:05.419
Director of Clinical Neuropsychology, director of the Arizona Alzheimer's Consortium 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:06.129
Education Core 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.219
and Professor in the Department of Psychology, Neurology, and Psychiatry at the

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:11.849
University of Arizona

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.289
So, if your foot hurts, 

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:19.250
anything else you can see Al and he'll probably fix it.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.700
His research has focused on the neuro-psychology of Alzheimer's Disease

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:27.199
age related neurological disorders, consciousness, 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:29.559
memory, and the monitoring of self-emotion. 

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:33.520
Doctor Kaszniak has been an adviser to various national institutes and agency's concerned 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.800
with aging and Alzheimer's Disease. 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.889
He is a Fellow of the American Psychological Association and a Fellow the Association for

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:42.240
Psychological Science.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.490
We are indeed lucky to have Al here tonight 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.850
to give us a lecture

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.500
and we're equally as lucky to have him as a colleague here at the University of Arizona.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.050
It's a pleasure working with Al.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:59.050
Please welcome Al to this evening's lecture. 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:09.830
Thank you Joaquin for the kind words of introduction.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.979
Thank you all for being here. It is so gratifying to see so many of you, 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:17.119
many old friends, young friends

00:05:17.119 --> 00:05:19.899
and what we all hope will be new friends 

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:23.010
for the College of Science.

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.330
I'm going to be talking 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.400
about 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.189
metamemory. 

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:31.729
But before I define what that is 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:34.110
I would like to start by telling you

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.279
a little bit about a clinical mystery

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:39.789
that first presented itself to me

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:41.479
in the middle 1980s. 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:45.770
Not too long after we had started our memory disorders clinic,

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.810
that I had co-directed 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.099
over at University Medical Center. 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:56.150
The mystery starts off with a patient we will arbitrarily call M.T. 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.790
who was referred to us for consultation

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.219
to see whether we could assist with diagnosis and in the planning of treatment

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:05.750
and this individual had a very severe memory 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.679
impairment.

00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:10.610
When I met him in the lobby 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.639
I introduced myself. I then went into the examining room and 15 minutes later he was brought

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:15.549
in there

00:06:15.549 --> 00:06:17.440
had no idea that we had met

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.210
already - so quite severe 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:20.409
memory impairment.

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:22.189
And he seemed very aware

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:23.789
of that impairment.

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:25.429
He could complain

00:06:25.429 --> 00:06:27.449
to me about it

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:31.599
when I would present him with various memory tests that we do in the clinic

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:34.879
he was able to say "You know that's exactly the kind of thing

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:39.039
I have a really hard time with I know I'm going to do really terrible."

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:41.319
And he did. 

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:42.879
In contrast

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:45.460
an individual we will call patient A. D. 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.940
had an equally severe memory impairment. 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.530
Same situation, met her in the lobby, 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.779
into the examining room, didn't recognize we had met before

00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:57.229
but she seemed quite unaware 

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:00.340
of the severity of her impairment.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:05.029
when I asked her why she was there to see me, talked about something irrelevant

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:07.069
and when we started the testing

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:12.150
she would frequently comment, "Oh my memory has always always been really good. This is going to be way too

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:13.550
simple for me."

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.249
And then, of course, would have enormous difficulty with it.

00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:19.279
Some frustration from time to time while doing it  

00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:23.199
but upon completing the task seemed to have no awareness

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:24.399
that, in fact, 

00:07:24.399 --> 00:07:28.699
it revealed a very very compromised memory.

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:31.540
So, the question these two people posed to me was,

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:35.470
with equally severe memory impairment 

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:37.389
why are they so different

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:39.389
in their apparent awareness 

00:07:39.389 --> 00:07:41.099
of that impairment.

00:07:41.099 --> 00:07:43.959
And a bigger question for me that arose was 

00:07:43.959 --> 00:07:48.599
if memory is a function of brain processes as we've been hearing about in this 

00:07:48.599 --> 00:07:49.179
lecture series 

00:07:49.179 --> 00:07:53.180
then how does the brain predict its own future activity?

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:58.490
How does the brain know what it's going to be able to do, remember, etc., 

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:00.249
at some point in the future? 

00:08:00.249 --> 00:08:03.520
It's the neuro-scientific area of metamemory research

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.570
that tends to answer those questions. 

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:08.339
So let's begin with a couple of quick definitions. 

00:08:08.339 --> 00:08:10.129
The dictionary definition of memory

00:08:10.129 --> 00:08:14.309
is the mental faculty of retaining and recalling past experience

00:08:14.309 --> 00:08:16.370
and the act, or instance, 

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:17.719
of remembering. 

00:08:17.719 --> 00:08:24.089
In contrast, metamemory is defined as knowledge about one's own memory capabilities and contents, 

00:08:24.089 --> 00:08:26.000
and knowledge about strategies

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.169
that can aid 

00:08:27.169 --> 00:08:29.849
in memory.

00:08:29.849 --> 00:08:34.030
Lest you think that this big mouthful, metamemory,

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:39.019
suggests that this is something arcane and that only nerdy scientists care about

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:41.360
each of you utilizes metamemory

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.890
on a daily basis.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.259
So how many of you drove here

00:08:45.259 --> 00:08:47.260
this evening

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.480
all right

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.760
now

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.660
most of you I suspect

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:56.730
anticipated finding your car.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.740
How do you know that?

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:02.870
How do you know that you're going to be able to locate your car?

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:06.740
I  go to the airport and park before a trip, 

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:08.880
what I know with great confidence is

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.530
I won't remember where it is

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:12.830
when I get back.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:15.430
So I'm going to write it down.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.830
That's metamemory at work.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:20.480
That's the process by which 

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.010
the brain is making predictions 

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:27.420
about its own future processes. 

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.970
Scholars, 

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:32.990
such as this harried young faculty member,

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:35.040
how does this person know

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.430
when the arcane text has been studied sufficiently

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:42.890
and he'll be able to remember it the following morning in a lecture

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:47.250
and we can now give himself some well-deserved rest?

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.500
We utilize metamemory 

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:56.500
when we're studying all of you who are students a former students out there

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:57.919
you've had this kind of experience, right?

00:09:57.919 --> 00:10:03.070
From the book, through the head, gone forever. 

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:06.229
But you are often aware of that at the time and what do you do?

00:10:06.229 --> 00:10:08.490
You catch yourself, you go back 

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:10.090
and you re-read.

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:13.449
or you think about it in a different way. You might recast it, 

00:10:13.449 --> 00:10:15.930
you use some kind of a strategy

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:19.270
that enables you to remember it better.

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:21.510
And it's the ability 

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:22.720
to know 

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.590
that it's not getting in 

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:29.830
and ability to select a strategy that will help get it in

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:33.520
that's a part of this thing we call metamemory

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:39.390
Now that second individual in the clinical mystery I told you about, patient A. D., 

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:42.330
turned out to have Alzheimer's Disease.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:45.230
Terrible illness, as I think as most of you know.

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:46.550
It's quite prevalent 

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:50.480
about 5.3 million of us in the 
United States have it.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:54.630
Projections are that by the year 2050 that number will triple.

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:57.040
Very, very disturbing.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:01.330
It is age associated. The older we get the higher our risk developing it.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:05.540
It's presently irreversible even though many of us are working very hard on trying to find

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.470
a prevention and cure

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:09.760
and it's a the major cause

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.890
of this syndrome of dementia by which we mean 

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:14.439
a decline 

00:11:14.439 --> 00:11:18.120
in 2 or more areas of mental functioning 

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.000
one of them typically being memory.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.500
Now if we take a look

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:23.400
as if we are gazing 

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.910
from the side of the head and we were all Superman or Superwoman we could gaze 

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:29.620
inside the skin in the skull

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:30.980
what we would see 

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.299
is the brain

00:11:32.299 --> 00:11:33.630
revealed 

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:38.900
in which there are certain landmarks so here right behind the eyes 

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.520
we see an area called the frontal lobes 

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.080
and right behind that

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.649
the parietal lobes and underneath that 

00:11:45.649 --> 00:11:47.189
the temporal lobes 

00:11:47.189 --> 00:11:48.960
and behind that 

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.010
the occipital lobes. 

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:53.520
No other similar looking on both sides

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.559
two separate hemisphere's

00:11:55.559 --> 00:11:57.880
underneath it the cerebellum 

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.430
and then connected

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:00.439
on the bottom

00:12:00.439 --> 00:12:02.260
the brain stem

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:03.049
continuous with

00:12:03.049 --> 00:12:05.150
the spinal cord.

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:06.600
Ao I want you to 

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:11.169
keep in mind that orientation because I'll try to utilize most of my images 

00:12:11.169 --> 00:12:14.170
from that same kind of angle.

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:18.020
If we were to further tune up our  X-RAY vision

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:21.750
what we would see penetrating deeper within the brain

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.310
is that there are some structures

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:26.680
that lie underneath this 

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.930
outer most part of the brain, the cortex, which means bark 

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:32.440
the outer most covering of a tree 

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.850
and a very important one for memory 

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:36.900
is this structure shown right here

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.660
the hippocampus

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:42.650
it's bilateral meeting there's one of them on each side.

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:44.690
And it was this structure 

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:46.319
that was quite damage 

00:12:46.319 --> 00:12:49.850
in the first person in that clinic a mystery that I told you about.

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:53.030
He had sustained to a cardiac arrest 

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:57.790
his brain was deprived of oxygen for a critical period of time

00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:01.660
leaving a certain nerve cells within that structure 0:13:01.660,0:13:03.740
permanently damaged.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:07.230
But in a circumscribed way, other areas were not

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:08.480
damaged.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.590
In contrast, 

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:14.370
patient A. D. who seemed so unaware of her memory impairment 

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:17.560
also has damage to this structure,

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:20.480
microscopic damage that's a part of Alzheimer's Disease,

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.510
but in addition

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.640
as this progresses - 

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:29.180
here we're looking from the side in this time we're looking at the middle surface 

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:31.530
of that right side of the brain

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:33.430
gazing in from the left - 

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:37.770
what you can see is in the pre-clinical stages while things are still mild can't

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:40.030
really be confidently diagnosed

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:41.000
the damage

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.020
is relatively circumscribed to that temporal lobe 

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:47.850
where the hippocampus is located deep within

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:50.420
and a little bit of the bottom of that frontal lobe

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:54.720
but as the illness progresses from mild to even more severe stages 

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.300
increasing amounts of the brain affected.

00:13:59.649 --> 00:14:05.360
To only the areas responsible for processing basic sensory information 

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.070
and controlling movement

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:09.209
that are left relatively 

00:14:09.209 --> 00:14:09.930
intact.

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:14.830
So that's a widespread amount of brain that's affected by this illness.

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:17.440
One aspect of that 

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.050
is making the contribution

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:23.250
of impairing the person's awareness

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:25.060
of their memory impairment.

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:28.620
Why are people with this illness different in that way 

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.270
than the person I just previously described

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.940
who had the cardiac arrest

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:34.890
related damage 

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:38.430
to that memory important hippocampus.

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:41.190
In order to address that question 

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:45.370
and look at the relationship between damage 
in the brain

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:47.560
and metamemory difficulty 

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:50.730
it's necessary to bring metamemory  into the laboratory.

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:54.400
So how is it that we might do that?

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.010
What we decided to do

00:14:56.010 --> 00:15:00.449
is utilize a number of different kinds 
of tasks, finally arriving 

00:15:00.449 --> 00:15:03.090
at the one we rely on most which is called

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:05.710
feeling-of-knowing

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:06.870
task

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:09.660
which attempts to tap into this phenomenon

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:11.680
feeling-of-knowing.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:16.000
Feeling-of-knowing defined as a subjective state in which the person is trying to remember something

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.080
that they believe they know

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.630
but can't now retrieve.

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:23.210
Back in 1890, William James 

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:26.100
one of the fathers of scientific psychology

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:27.499
had this to say

00:15:27.499 --> 00:15:31.849
about feeling-of-knowing as it occurs in
the tip-of-the-tongue 

00:15:31.849 --> 00:15:32.970
experience.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:35.690
It's "a gap that is intensely active 

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:36.730
a sort of wraith of the name 

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:38.490
is in it

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:40.450
beckoning us in a given direction

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:41.660
making us at moments tingle 

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:44.120
with the sense of our closeness 

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:48.970
and then letting us sink back without 
the longed-for term."

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:51.680
Sounds familiar?

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:57.060
For for those of you who are similar to myself are members of the gray hair persuasion

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:58.290
you may have noticed

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:00.560
that this increases with frequency

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.960
as we get older

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.519
Okay? Tip-of-the-tongue 

00:16:04.519 --> 00:16:05.750
experience 

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:08.680
manifesting this feeling of knowing 

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:12.560
so what kind of a task can construct to get at this?

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:18.040
We us a kind of verbal memory task in which there were three different phases.

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.100
The first is the study phase.

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.770
We present the individual with a set  

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:26.420
of sentences constructed such that

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:31.009
the very last word of the sentence is of low frequency. In other words

00:16:31.009 --> 00:16:33.850
it's not very easily predictable

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:35.809
from the first part of the sentence.

00:16:35.809 --> 00:16:38.030
So that people can't simply guess 

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:40.270
what the correct last word might be 

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:45.180
and we give several such sentences in this study or learning phase. 

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:46.940
In the next phase of it 

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.879
we then show the individual the sentence stem 

00:16:49.879 --> 00:16:53.920
she showed her friend for example a new card

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.880
ask the person to recall

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:59.620
what's the correct completion of that sentence.

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:01.350
Following that answer 

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:05.610
we ask the person to give a retrospective confidence rating. In other words

00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:07.300
how certain are you

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.510
that you gave the correct answer? From extremely uncertain

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:12.690
to extremely certain.

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:16.850
And then for those sentences that they don't correctly complete 

00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:21.060
we ask them to give the critical feeling of knowing rating

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.059
and what we're requesting here 

00:17:23.059 --> 00:17:25.540
is the individual to predict

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:32.090
that later when I show them and multiple choices for what that completing last word might be 

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:34.730
they'll be able to identify the correct one

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:36.480
and so pure guess

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:42.120
low probably or high probability of correctly recognizing it.

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:45.400
Then finally the recognition task itself 

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.100
where we again provide that sentence stem 

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:51.670
along with these multiple choices

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:53.190
and critically

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:55.429
for the variable of interest here

00:17:55.429 --> 00:18:01.590
we're looking at the feeling of knowing accuracy, defined as the concordance 

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:04.340
between the feeling-of-knowing prediction

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:07.770
and the actual recognition memory success. 

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:10.260
Okay. Reasonable and straightforward

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.430
memory paradigm. 

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:16.950
So what did we find in relationship to Alzheimer's Disease. 

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:20.669
Studying the number of individuals and comparing them to  

00:18:20.669 --> 00:18:22.950
their spouse caregivers

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:25.540
we found that 

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:26.620
accuracy

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:29.840
for both retrospective confidence ratings

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.350
as well as different ways of 

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:34.040
measuring were applying a metric

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:38.040
to this feeling of knowing the accuracy 
and both of those instances

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:41.460
the persons with Alzheimer's Disease were 
less accurate

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.750
than their spouses,  

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:44.919
documenting that there is

00:18:44.919 --> 00:18:46.570
a metamemory impairment 

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:50.940
that's associated with this illness.

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:57.110
As we began to do work in this area and study some other neurologic groups

00:18:57.110 --> 00:19:02.240
a number of other investigators across the world were similarly getting interested in this 

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.510
and by 2005 there had been enough studies

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:07.250
that have been published

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:09.179
for us to do 

00:19:09.179 --> 00:19:10.409
a review of

00:19:10.409 --> 00:19:12.780
what has been learned

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:15.000
from this area of investigation. 

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.030
One of my former graduate students, Jasmine Pano [?]

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:19.250
and myself 

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:21.060
reviewed that literature

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:25.960
and what we found was that in addition to Alzheimer's Disease. 

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.980
metamemory was being 

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:30.040
confirmed in the laboratory also

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:33.370
in human immunodeficiency virus infection

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:36.600
when it involves the brain

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.320
in multiple sclerosis 

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:43.760
when it's not just in the spinal court but
also in the brain.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.200
Huntington's Disease, a genetic

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.860
disease that involves both a movement disorder and 

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:52.030
progressive dementia.

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:53.900
Korsakoff's syndrome, 

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.800
a very severe memory impairment, 

00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:02.100
typically caused by chronic alcohol abuse and thiamine deficiency

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.680
and traumatic brain injury

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:08.070
particularly will be more severe when the individual had a period of unconsciousness

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:09.200
for a while

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:13.370
so what is it that all of these apparently
diversity indices

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:18.220
share in common they have different causes or ideologies, they manifest somewhat differently

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.150
all of them manifesting

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:22.260
this metamemory

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.020
impairment

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.970
each of them

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:28.270
involves some damage to 

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:32.550
these front lobes of the brain particularly these two front most part of it

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:35.630
that we call the prefrontal area.

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:38.570
Well that's a pretty big expansive real estate

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:41.720
in your brain, is it not?

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:45.320
Are there particular areas within it, or structures within it, 

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.230
that are most important?

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:50.860
now in order to ask that question we have to move away 

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:54.990
from these indices that affect the brain in a more generalized or more diffuse

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:55.789
way

00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:57.880
and start looking

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.190
at neurologic disorders that

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:00.860
damage

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:03.290
a very circumscribed part of the brain.

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:05.460
And so the syndrome of course

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:06.919
that we went to 

00:21:06.919 --> 00:21:08.110
was stroke. 

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:09.829
Here one particular

00:21:09.829 --> 00:21:13.390
cause of stroke, that being a blood clot, 

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:15.979
that travels along an artery until 

00:21:15.979 --> 00:21:19.970
the diameter of the artery gets sufficiently expanded and it blocks the flow

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:23.240
in the area of the brain that is being fed

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.650
by that vessel

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:27.450
is deprived of oxygen and nutrients

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:28.889
and that tissue

00:21:28.889 --> 00:21:31.380
dies. 

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:34.730
That is a stroke and another kind of stroke is when there's bleeding in the brain but

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:37.060
for simplicity sake we'll pretend that

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:38.820
this is the major kind and in fact 

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:41.870
this was the major cause for most of the individuals

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:44.090
that we studied.

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:46.260
So it took us about 3 years

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:51.309
to accumulate enough individuals that were willing to volunteer for study

00:21:51.309 --> 00:21:53.920
who had this circumscribed damage 

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.940
to the frontal lobe, to the front part

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:58.320
the of the brain.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:04.360
And even though these individuals did not have obvious memory impairment like the 

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.249
people that I was describing

00:22:06.249 --> 00:22:09.920
in the so-called clinical mystery, 

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.300
On average 

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:16.300
they had impairment in their metamemory that is they were quite poor 

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.750
at predicting 

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:24.250
what they would later to be able to recognize.

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:26.559
It confirmed an association

00:22:26.559 --> 00:22:27.890
of metamemory 

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:29.770
with damage to the frontal lobes 

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:35.289
but as of yet we don't know very much more about where within this expanse of the frontal lobes 

00:22:35.289 --> 00:22:38.530
the critical location of damage might be.

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:40.750
So here we went to

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:43.450
so-called structural neuro-imaging 

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:46.370
magnetic resonance imaging in particular

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:50.760
and here in schematic we've got a cut-away view, so we've opened up the side of the

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:51.250
machine, 

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:53.039
you can see the individual

00:22:53.039 --> 00:22:55.320
lying on that table

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.190
inside of this large magnet

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:00.790
with radio frequency coils and receding coils 

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:03.490
the combination of 

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:06.090
extraordinarily creative physics

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:07.900
and computer science

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.770
an expert engineering 

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:12.580
has resulted in a technology

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:15.750
that lets us see in a three-dimensional way 

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:17.470
within the brain.

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:19.040
And because 

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:22.100
the signals that are being picked up

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:28.730
are very sensitive to the molecular composition of the tissue in this strong magnetic field

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:30.990
able to differentiate

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:32.840
living healthy tissue

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:35.100
from damaged tissue

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:36.570
also enables us 

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:37.870
as shown here

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:42.470
to take different slices of the brain. Here we've gone from one side

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:44.140
of the head

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:46.570
moving toward the center

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:48.920
moving then beyond the center

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.690
continuing on to the other side

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:52.090
of the head

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:53.860
and finally getting to the

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:55.380
outer most part 

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:57.570
of the skull.

00:23:57.570 --> 00:24:00.539
We can also visualize in other

00:24:00.539 --> 00:24:03.600
directions so here starting at the back of the head

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.880
moving forward

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.690
seeing the cerebellum 

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:10.510
the ears will soon begin to show - here they are - 

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:13.210
we move increasingly forward the brain stem

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:15.640
the fluid filled spaces within the brain

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.700
we continue to move forward

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:19.639
and we see eventually

00:24:19.639 --> 00:24:23.500
the eyeballs manifesting

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.309
and way up in the front most part of the brain.

00:24:26.309 --> 00:24:31.220
Aliens, huh. 

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:32.610
Detailed visualization

00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:34.179
of the 
0:24:34.179,0:24:36.880
contents of the skull, the cranial contents,

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.769
in a way that provides us

00:24:38.769 --> 00:24:40.679
a lot of information

00:24:40.679 --> 00:24:43.180
about areas that are damaged.

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:47.740
And what it allows this thing to do - here we're looking from the top of the brain down - 

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:49.160
the nose would be 

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.470
up at the front part, 

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:52.149
these are different slices from

00:24:52.149 --> 00:24:54.630
so fairly far down in the brain

00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:55.340
increasingly

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:57.640
far up until we get to this top one 

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:00.200
and the black areas show us where the damage

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.720
has occurred.

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:02.780
So we can assume 

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:05.490
from the information from those slices together

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:07.290
with the aid of the computer

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:09.280
we can reconstruct

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.240
a three dimensional image

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.979
that allows us then 

00:25:12.979 --> 00:25:14.379
to morph 

00:25:14.379 --> 00:25:17.090
the different brains of each of the individuals

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:20.679
in other words put them onto a common scale, put them on to  

00:25:20.679 --> 00:25:21.709
a common

00:25:21.709 --> 00:25:27.179
idealized brain so that all of the areas are located in the same place and ask the

00:25:27.179 --> 00:25:28.120
question

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:29.960
for those people

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.790
who show the most severe

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:35.720
metamemory impairment, in other words who are 
the poorest

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.940
in this prediction 

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:41.370
of their later recognition memory performance

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:43.240
What is in common between them?

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.840
Where's there overlap in the damage?

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.290
And what we found

00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:49.290
was that that overlap

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:50.880
is in this right

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.320
right side of the brain - 

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.850
here we've cut away 

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:58.070
the from on the left hemisphere so we can see inside the brain - we've done that

00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:00.090
with computer reconstruction

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:01.630
So it's in there right

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:03.450
middle, or medial, 

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:05.019
prefrontal or

00:26:05.019 --> 00:26:06.570
front-most part 

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:11.150
of the brain.

00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:13.330
That encourages

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:14.530
our

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:15.320
suspicion

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:18.790
that this area is playing an important role.

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:21.970
in these metamemory processes.

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:26.000
But, that's one kind of a test, this verbal feeling-of-knowing task.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.980
Does that metamemory impairment extend to other

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:30.950
areas

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:35.690
beyond the verbal domain and perhaps to include
faces?

00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:38.070
I don't think any of you would quible with the statement

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:39.970
that memory for faces

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:43.010
it was an important faculty

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:44.269
something we rely on

00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:46.090
every day. It's how we know 

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:48.560
someone is familiar.

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.480
But imagine what would happen, 

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:53.720
you gentleman out there, 

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.059
if 

00:26:55.059 --> 00:26:57.830
you thought that the face of a stranger

00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:59.460
was your wife

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:05.490
and acted accordingly

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:09.540
Well, your face might be in trouble. 

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:14.470
That's got to hurt, don't you think?

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:17.580
So we constructed a task

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:18.440
utilizing

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:19.720
famous faces

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:25.110
faces of individuals that are well known, in the media, sports, that sort of thing

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:26.180
and

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:30.860
for the retrospective confidence task analogous to the verbal one I talked about 

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:31.810
before

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:36.740
we showed a series of these faces sequentially.

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:40.920
People were given 8 multiple-choice names to choose from. Asked who is this person?

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:43.910
And then they made a retrospective confidence judgment - 

00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:46.170
how confident are they that they are correct.

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:50.190
It might look something like this.

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:56.910
I'm just going to give you three choices to
make it easy - it's late

00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:58.440
Who's that? Uma Thurman, Okay?

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:01.100
Very popular in the movies recently.

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:04.960
And then you'd be asked to make that that confidence judgment; how confident are you that you chose

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.789
the correct name?

00:28:07.789 --> 00:28:09.240
For the feeling-of-knowing task 

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:13.370
we ask you to actually name the individual

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:14.350
and then if you can't 

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:16.080
come up with the name

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:20.580
we ask you again how confidential you are that you'll be able to the name the person if you're given a multiple

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:21.480
choice

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:26.240
the face is very familiar to you so we have some that are famous famous not so famous

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.700
less famous

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:29.750
and then there's a recognition memory

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:32.450
task at the end so that we can compute

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:36.450
this concordance of correspondents, how accurate is their prediction?

00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:39.500
So who's that?

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.480
okay. 

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:41.730
Little less 

00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:42.280
vocal, 

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:43.790
fewer of you knew.

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:45.390
who that is.

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:50.130
Most of you who do are my age or older

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:54.510
What? You don't watch re-runs of the Parent Trap? 

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:58.850
That's Hayley Mills.

00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:00.770
As in our previous study

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:02.190
what we observed 

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:03.750
was that

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:05.780
those individuals

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:07.470
with frontal damage 

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:11.490
who had the lowest feeling-of-knowing accuracy

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:14.350
Showed this region of overlap of damage

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:18.630
within this so-called ventromedial or lower middle area 

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:23.630
area of the front lobe.

00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:24.900
That area,

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:26.150
maybe, 

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:28.990
is the chief participant

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:33.580
something that provides a necessary

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:34.590
contribution

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:39.090
to the way in which the brain makes predictions about its

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:41.440
future activity.

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.339
But we don't know, really 

00:29:43.339 --> 00:29:46.340
whether it's that area or 

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:49.200
connecting fibers that are passing through it

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:54.060
the damaged brain doesn't allow us to disentangle those two possibilities.

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:55.120
So we then moved 

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:55.980
to

00:29:55.980 --> 00:30:01.300
another technology utilizing the same magnetic resonance imaging machinery that I just showed

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:02.640
you

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.820
but this time

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:05.810
measuring

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:12.800
a blood oxygen level dependent signal.

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.900
Now, what that reflects

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:17.040
is blood flow

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.649
to

00:30:18.649 --> 00:30:21.710
neuron brain areas 

00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:25.890
that are metabolically active. 

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:28.870
When an area is doing work

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:34.430
it is more metabolically active it is requiring more blood, more oxygen, more nutrients.

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:40.540
So that allows us to image brain areas that are at work during particular stimulus or  

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:41.910
task conditions

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:45.790
and also it allows us to visualize quite small regions

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:47.490
of the brain

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:51.700
at a level of resolution or ability to visualize an area

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:55.220
much more fine grain than we'd be able to infer from looking at

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:58.130
different areas of damage. 

00:30:58.130 --> 00:30:59.640
So this gives you 

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.549
a kind of cartoon 

00:31:01.549 --> 00:31:03.580
of how that works.

00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:05.190
You'll notice if you watch this

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:08.130
that when there's the simple cross-haired patterns

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:11.980
the activity is more toward the back

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:12.380
of 

00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:13.419
the brain

00:31:13.419 --> 00:31:17.240
and when it switches to this animate kind of object

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:19.610
more reflected in activity

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:22.210
in these more lateral 

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:23.640
or side more most portions.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:28.580
This is an area of the brain that tends to code for very simple kind of visual lines

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:29.880
and angles

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.019
the other area 

00:31:31.019 --> 00:31:33.919
is one that is specialized 

00:31:33.919 --> 00:31:40.049
for detecting biological motion - motion of beings.

00:31:40.049 --> 00:31:43.609
In the technology of functional magnetic resonance imaging

00:31:43.609 --> 00:31:46.639
what we are doing is always contrasting

00:31:46.639 --> 00:31:48.600
two different kinds of conditions

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.630
as I've shown you here.

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:52.600
So that we can determine

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:56.830
what is unique keeping everything else constant, it's all visual stimuli

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:57.990
the same environment

00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:00.010
keeping everything else constant

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:00.559
except

00:32:00.559 --> 00:32:03.200
the variable of critical interest. 

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.419
And in our case

00:32:04.419 --> 00:32:06.280
it's going to be

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:07.830
this metamemory

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:08.730
or

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:11.750
memory self-awareness self-prediction.

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:15.420
So again we used faces as the task

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:18.419
we asked "Who is that?"

00:32:18.419 --> 00:32:21.090
Most of you know Marilyn Monroe .

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:24.100
But we can't ask you to say it in the scanner

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:26.610
because what happens when you talk

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:28.610
is that your head moves

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:29.480
and 

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.470
the brain image gets blurry.

00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:32.910
This motion artifact

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:34.370
we don't want that

00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:35.380
so instead

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:39.070
we use a simple 3 button mouse that the person is holding onto

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:40.539
in this scanner

00:32:40.539 --> 00:32:43.679
and they make a choice with one of 3 button presses 

00:32:43.679 --> 00:32:48.240
of either they know the name, they've retrieved it successfully;

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:52.070
they can't retrieve it but they have a feeling that they know it;

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:54.420
or they simply don't know who that is at all.

00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:58.039
And of course afterwards we do a recognition task just to make sure that

00:32:58.039 --> 00:33:03.090
they're accurate and since these are healthy individuals it's not that hard of the task.

00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:04.409
Accuracy was

00:33:04.409 --> 00:33:07.220
up well above 90%.

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:10.720
What we do then is based upon their response 

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.559
after all of this

00:33:12.559 --> 00:33:15.159
blood oxygen dependent 

00:33:15.159 --> 00:33:16.560
information is collected

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:21.030
we've group that information according to those responses so we can contrast

00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:23.159
what's associated with

00:33:23.159 --> 00:33:24.510
successful retrieval, 

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:26.040
what's associated with

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:29.269
a feeling-of-knowing.

00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:32.520
So who's that?

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.090
A few of you know Rob Lowe, 

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:36.769
somewhat less famous

00:33:36.769 --> 00:33:40.840
unless you read the tabloids and we don't want to go there. 

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:45.870
How about this person?

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:51.550
None of you know? Me either. 

00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:53.880
That's because while

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:57.749
this individual was blessed with a face that looks like it could be famous

00:33:57.749 --> 00:34:02.570
she is not.

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:06.740
When we looked at the appropriate contrast or comparison what we found

00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:08.129
was that

00:34:08.129 --> 00:34:08.559
feeling-of-knowing

00:34:08.559 --> 00:34:10.099
was associated

00:34:10.099 --> 00:34:11.159
again as we saw

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:13.819
with the focal damage studies

00:34:13.819 --> 00:34:16.450
with this right frontal 

00:34:16.450 --> 00:34:20.579
as well as another structure called 
the anterior cingulate cortex

00:34:20.579 --> 00:34:23.359
right in the same region.

00:34:23.359 --> 00:34:26.999
First of all look at how much finer of the grain 

00:34:26.999 --> 00:34:29.690
greater specificity we can have about

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:31.239
where the critical 

00:34:31.239 --> 00:34:34.019
region might be. But convergence of information

00:34:34.019 --> 00:34:36.729
with the focal damage studies

00:34:36.729 --> 00:34:38.520
now that was quite different

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:42.360
from what we saw to be associated with successful retrieval

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:43.739
of the face names

00:34:43.739 --> 00:34:45.370
in which the 

00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:46.839
medial temporal,

00:34:46.839 --> 00:34:48.960
that's what's shown in the crosshairs here,

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:51.549
and some of these parietal areas

00:34:51.549 --> 00:34:53.089
were activated

00:34:53.089 --> 00:34:54.819
that again remember

00:34:54.819 --> 00:34:59.210
that's where the hippocampus is, that's that very memory important structure.  

00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:01.459
So memory and metamemory 

00:35:01.459 --> 00:35:02.469
separable 

00:35:02.469 --> 00:35:04.149
within the brain.

00:35:04.149 --> 00:35:08.159
Not where those functions live

00:35:08.159 --> 00:35:10.939
but structures that contribute critically

00:35:10.939 --> 00:35:15.609
to the carrying out of those processes.

00:35:15.609 --> 00:35:17.560
A number of other studies have 

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:19.079
also found

00:35:19.079 --> 00:35:20.420
activation within this

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:22.910
medial prefrontal area

00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:27.459
and they primarily included tasks that included memory for self-traits -

00:35:27.459 --> 00:35:30.469
I give you a series of adjectives and I ask you whether

00:35:30.469 --> 00:35:31.450
those are 

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:33.680
either like or not like you

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.830
and also tasks that ask you to make plans

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:40.110
or to formulate aspirations 

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:41.400
for the future.

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:45.569
So we may conclude that this medial prefrontal cortex

00:35:45.569 --> 00:35:48.460
is participating in a kind of computation 

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:50.439
of the self

00:35:50.439 --> 00:35:53.229
that which maintains the continuity

00:35:53.229 --> 00:35:58.059
of our identity across time remembering our past 

00:35:58.059 --> 00:36:00.229
And using what we know from memory

00:36:00.229 --> 00:36:02.549
to construct scenarios

00:36:02.549 --> 00:36:04.199
and make predictions about

00:36:04.199 --> 00:36:05.650
the future.

00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:06.650
So it's a way

00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:08.650
that the brain can weave together

00:36:08.650 --> 00:36:12.260
its knowledge of our preferences, our values our ethnicity

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:16.029
our beliefs our possessions our occupations - all those things 

00:36:16.029 --> 00:36:17.979
that are part of self

00:36:17.979 --> 00:36:20.079
identity.

00:36:20.079 --> 00:36:25.039
Now it turns out that that computed self, as I'll call it

00:36:25.039 --> 00:36:28.269
is also used by our brain to simulate

00:36:28.269 --> 00:36:29.900
the experience of others

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:31.779
and predict their behavior. 

00:36:31.779 --> 00:36:36.150
so in a classical task that's called the Sally-Anne test

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:37.809
it goes as follows.

00:36:37.809 --> 00:36:41.719
Their salary on the left, there's Anne on the right, 

00:36:41.719 --> 00:36:43.880
Sally puts her ball in the basket

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:46.029
she then goes away leaves the scene

00:36:46.029 --> 00:36:49.939
and while she's gone and moves the ball from the basket to the box

00:36:49.939 --> 00:36:52.390
the critical question is then

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:53.650
where will Sally 

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:56.220
look for ball?

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:59.020
well if you are an adult or a child over about 

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:00.539
the age of 4

00:37:00.539 --> 00:37:03.509
what are you going to say?

00:37:03.509 --> 00:37:07.049
Okay. The group said that she was going to look for it

00:37:07.049 --> 00:37:11.059
in that basket because that's where Sally put it.

00:37:11.059 --> 00:37:13.819
You are able to utilize 

00:37:13.819 --> 00:37:17.169
that simulation capacity

00:37:17.169 --> 00:37:19.159
recreating 

00:37:19.159 --> 00:37:19.869
yourself

00:37:19.869 --> 00:37:23.210
and transforming it into what is the perspective of the other 

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:24.869
would be like.

00:37:24.869 --> 00:37:25.670
If you're 3 years old 

00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:29.490
what you're going to say is she's going to look in the box because that's what

00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:31.709
you the participants saw 

00:37:31.709 --> 00:37:33.909
and you're not able to make that

00:37:33.909 --> 00:37:36.409
switch.

00:37:36.409 --> 00:37:41.599
When that kind of task is done in the brain scanner 

00:37:41.599 --> 00:37:42.920
what is found is that

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:47.630
this area, this time we've reversed the brain so now the the nose is facing to your right

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:49.319
in all these images

00:37:49.319 --> 00:37:50.799
that same area of 

00:37:51.779 --> 00:37:57.119
the medial prefrontal cortex is activated in this so-called theory of mind or 

00:37:57.119 --> 00:38:00.309
mentalizing or mind reading task

00:38:00.309 --> 00:38:04.719
and that is the same area along with something a little further back that for right now 

00:38:04.719 --> 00:38:06.479
we're not going to talk about

00:38:06.479 --> 00:38:10.259
but some areas activated when we remember

00:38:10.259 --> 00:38:12.279
and when we

00:38:12.279 --> 00:38:15.819
project into the future or imagine the future.

00:38:15.819 --> 00:38:19.099
So this has been referred to as an interconnected

00:38:19.099 --> 00:38:20.899
medial temporal network

00:38:20.899 --> 00:38:25.059
making use of this medial or middle temporal structure hippocampus

00:38:25.059 --> 00:38:28.819
and those areas that it's the most densely connected to
again, a kind of self-generating stimulating

00:38:33.209 --> 00:38:34.949
machinery.

00:38:34.949 --> 00:38:37.570
Very recently it was discovered

00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:41.009
that if we look at what the brain is doing at rest

00:38:41.009 --> 00:38:45.160
when individuals are not giving any task to perform

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:45.910
it's the same

00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:47.079
areas 

00:38:47.079 --> 00:38:49.279
that are activated. 

00:38:49.279 --> 00:38:50.799
What's going on?

00:38:50.799 --> 00:38:53.309
What are we doing when we're at rest?

00:38:53.309 --> 00:38:55.789
We're not listening

00:38:55.789 --> 00:38:58.249
We're computing the self.

00:38:58.249 --> 00:39:03.259
"Ah, I forgot to do that today. I gotta get up tomorrow early 

00:39:03.259 --> 00:39:07.809
and finish that and i'll see what she said probably mean she doesn't like me very well."

00:39:07.809 --> 00:39:11.150
yadda yadda yadda 

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:15.029
me me me. Computing the self.

00:39:15.029 --> 00:39:18.160
Computing the self is very useful as we've seen 

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.269
from making predictions

00:39:20.269 --> 00:39:21.109
about what

00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:24.319
you're likely to do in the future and what others are likely to do in the future and

00:39:24.319 --> 00:39:27.329
what others are likely to be experiencing

00:39:27.329 --> 00:39:30.069
but it can take care of the way, right?

00:39:30.069 --> 00:39:31.920
So, as Caravaggio 

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:34.929
in his famous painting Narcissus 

00:39:34.929 --> 00:39:36.210
illustrated 

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:38.799
that kind of activation of the self 

00:39:38.799 --> 00:39:41.819
can lead to self-absorption. 

00:39:41.819 --> 00:39:46.479
Narcissus gazing fondly at his image in the water.

00:39:46.479 --> 00:39:48.949
What can we do about that?

00:39:48.949 --> 00:39:55.759
Self preoccupation is annoying to friends and family.

00:39:55.759 --> 00:39:59.249
You probably don't want to do it all that much.

00:39:59.249 --> 00:40:02.719
It also

00:40:02.719 --> 00:40:04.380
distracts us.

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:05.869
The brain is a limited

00:40:05.869 --> 00:40:09.930
channel capacity processor, it can't do too many things at the same time

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:12.119
and if it's computing the self

00:40:12.119 --> 00:40:15.430
it's not paying attention to what's here right now.

00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:17.529
We're going to miss a lot.

00:40:17.529 --> 00:40:19.469
We're going to miss things

00:40:19.469 --> 00:40:26.469
that other people are saying to us - my wife is in the audience she knows about this.

00:40:27.259 --> 00:40:29.459
We're going to miss 

00:40:29.459 --> 00:40:30.490
some of the things

00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:32.380
they're going on around us.

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:34.239
So what are we going to do about that?

00:40:34.239 --> 00:40:36.669
Is there some

00:40:36.669 --> 00:40:37.539
thing

00:40:37.539 --> 00:40:38.859
we can learn 

00:40:38.859 --> 00:40:42.359
to help us disengage from that self-focus?

00:40:42.359 --> 00:40:45.910
Well for a number of thousands of years now ancient traditions

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:48.129
have used the kind of mental training

00:40:48.129 --> 00:40:50.289
a practice that

00:40:50.289 --> 00:40:51.099
individuals use

00:40:51.099 --> 00:40:53.169
to train their attention

00:40:53.169 --> 00:40:57.579
focusing upon some particular object very often the breath, it's convenient you carry around

00:40:57.579 --> 00:41:00.029
with you all the time, 

00:41:00.029 --> 00:41:00.970
and when

00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:04.379
that me me starts to be generated

00:41:04.379 --> 00:41:06.659
polls the attention away

00:41:06.659 --> 00:41:07.780
gently

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:08.560
disengaging

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:10.549
returning back to the focus

00:41:10.549 --> 00:41:12.250
over and over

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:14.329
and over again..

00:41:14.329 --> 00:41:16.519
And the claim that is made

00:41:16.519 --> 00:41:17.889
it's that

00:41:17.889 --> 00:41:20.159
that practice

00:41:20.159 --> 00:41:23.269
is enabling of 

00:41:23.269 --> 00:41:25.460
a more fluid disengagement

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:27.569
from self-focus.

00:41:27.569 --> 00:41:29.709
So, does science have anything to say

00:41:29.709 --> 00:41:30.789
about that?

00:41:30.789 --> 00:41:33.640
The recent study by a friend and colleague

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:35.709
Ted [?]

00:41:35.709 --> 00:41:36.760
found that

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:39.539
when you give individuals

00:41:39.539 --> 00:41:42.539
words or non-words that you flash before them

00:41:42.539 --> 00:41:45.709
the words tend to activate 

00:41:45.709 --> 00:41:50.039
if you will self-system or default system.

00:41:50.039 --> 00:41:51.899
Here you can see that

00:41:51.899 --> 00:41:56.359
medial frontal area, some of those more back or posterior areas 

00:41:56.359 --> 00:42:01.650
so those words create associations and those associations are referent to the self.

00:42:01.650 --> 00:42:07.380
But when they look to add individuals who Zen meditate with 3 or more years 

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:08.359
of practice experience

00:42:08.359 --> 00:42:09.590
and they studied 

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:12.070
the actual time course

00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:16.919
of these blood oxygen level responses what they found was Zen meditators showed

00:42:16.919 --> 00:42:17.890
in red

00:42:17.890 --> 00:42:21.249
the meditation naive individual shown in blue

00:42:21.249 --> 00:42:23.190
that in each of those areas

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:25.999
The Zen meditators where returning to baseline

00:42:25.999 --> 00:42:27.930
more quickly.

00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:30.989
As if the brian were saying "yes" what they're saying

00:42:30.989 --> 00:42:32.619
they're letting go

00:42:32.619 --> 00:42:36.569
of that self-activation more readily, they're more fluid and disengaging

00:42:36.569 --> 00:42:38.660
the word is gone

00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:41.449
back to rest.

00:42:41.449 --> 00:42:42.969
number of other studies

00:42:42.969 --> 00:42:45.819
have similarly suggested

00:42:45.819 --> 00:42:46.589
that

00:42:46.589 --> 00:42:48.649
with that kind of practice

00:42:48.649 --> 00:42:50.300
there is increasing skill 

00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:52.220
but being able to disengage

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:54.839
that computed self

00:42:54.839 --> 00:42:55.200
and

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:56.470
attend - 

00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:58.859
as my granddaughter is doing here to

00:42:58.859 --> 00:43:03.179
her first experience of hearing a rooster crow - 

00:43:03.179 --> 00:43:03.980
to the environment 

00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:05.910
around us.

00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:07.049
So I think

00:43:07.049 --> 00:43:08.630
we've got some hope

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:09.709
perhaps

00:43:09.709 --> 00:43:13.939
that neuroscience not only provides us with interesting things to talk about on a 

00:43:13.939 --> 00:43:19.499
Wednesday night when other stuff is too expensive to get admission to

00:43:19.499 --> 00:43:21.369
but also

00:43:21.369 --> 00:43:24.359
something that in our 21st century

00:43:24.359 --> 00:43:27.490
where science provides so much of the guidance

00:43:27.490 --> 00:43:28.949
for our lives

00:43:28.949 --> 00:43:30.529
a kind of bridge

00:43:30.529 --> 00:43:32.999
to traditions to practices

00:43:32.999 --> 00:43:34.559
they're quite ancient

00:43:34.559 --> 00:43:37.339
but that may provide us with

00:43:37.339 --> 00:43:39.170
a way 

00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:41.470
of being able to quiet down 

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:43.930
that self preoccupation

00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:47.009
attend to the world in which there is

00:43:47.009 --> 00:43:49.329
enormous suffering

00:43:49.329 --> 00:43:50.929
but also

00:43:50.929 --> 00:43:52.140
incredible beauty.

00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:59.140
Thank you all so much for being here this evening. 

00:44:23.659 --> 00:44:29.069
Any questions?

00:44:34.929 --> 00:44:39.929
My father died at 95 with almost no recognition

00:44:39.929 --> 00:44:40.959
of what he ate for lunch

00:44:40.959 --> 00:44:43.359
what had happened the day before 

00:44:43.359 --> 00:44:47.179
Yet, 

00:44:47.179 --> 00:44:48.739
when I said "Do you remember any John Keats?"

00:44:48.739 --> 00:44:50.970
the week before he died 

00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:53.239
he actually picked a verse of 'Nightingale'

00:44:53.239 --> 00:44:56.209
there's about mortality and he would smile when he saw 

00:44:56.209 --> 00:44:57.599
numbers on license plates 

00:44:57.599 --> 00:45:04.599
that had square roots and interesting mathematics. 

00:45:04.959 --> 00:45:09.439
Do you have any insights into this?

00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:18.640
We know each other so I'm first tempted to say that your father is just weird. [laughter]

00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:21.479
[laughter]

00:45:21.479 --> 00:45:22.389
[laughter]

00:45:22.389 --> 00:45:24.079
I may have a more informed answer

00:45:24.079 --> 00:45:25.079
about that and 

00:45:25.079 --> 00:45:27.309
that is that 

00:45:27.309 --> 00:45:28.959
in these progressive

00:45:28.959 --> 00:45:30.910
degenerative dementias, 

00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:34.769
and you didn't say it but perhaps he had Alzheimer's Disease,

00:45:34.769 --> 00:45:36.139
there are a number of 

00:45:36.139 --> 00:45:40.069
brain disorders that can create this 

00:45:40.069 --> 00:45:44.899
One of the things we've found, and i'll say probably a good 25 years or so ago

00:45:44.899 --> 00:45:46.369
is that

00:45:46.369 --> 00:45:49.739
is that memories that were established long ago, 

00:45:49.739 --> 00:45:53.390
and particularly those that we've had some occasion to rehearse, 

00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:54.300
and so 

00:45:55.210 --> 00:45:59.459
a favorite poet is something that he had occasion to bring to mind

00:45:59.459 --> 00:46:03.469
these are memories that seem to remain relatively intact

00:46:03.469 --> 00:46:05.250
for a longer period.

00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:08.339
Something that is of particular interest to the person

00:46:08.339 --> 00:46:09.089
like

00:46:09.089 --> 00:46:14.499
mathematical symbols - something that's reminiscent of a favorite hobby

00:46:14.499 --> 00:46:17.660
that will stay preserved for a longer period of time.

00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:22.850
It's the day to day experience that may not make reference to those

00:46:22.850 --> 00:46:24.610
preferred but familiar themes

00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:30.130
that seems to go the earliest. Thank you.

00:46:30.130 --> 00:46:35.150
yes?

00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:37.649
When you describe what you 

00:46:37.649 --> 00:46:38.140
what you call the whole system, 

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:39.689
the memory system, 

00:46:39.689 --> 00:46:41.679
is working 

00:46:41.679 --> 00:46:44.429
too much

00:46:44.429 --> 00:46:47.789
does it disturb

00:46:47.789 --> 00:46:50.720
does it make noise	

00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:52.249
that stops the brain from 

00:46:52.249 --> 00:46:53.380
working 

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:56.939
as effectively as it should be?   

00:46:56.939 --> 00:47:01.889
So the question is whether this default network that I mentioned is active 

00:47:01.889 --> 00:47:04.049
at rest 

00:47:04.049 --> 00:47:05.769
Is this something that gets in the way

00:47:05.769 --> 00:47:10.799
of establishing another memories? And the answer I think is yes

00:47:10.799 --> 00:47:13.099
the brain is a limited

00:47:13.099 --> 00:47:14.599
capacity device

00:47:14.599 --> 00:47:18.119
and it cannot process many things at the same
time

00:47:18.119 --> 00:47:20.630
and so if the tension

00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:22.140
is being drawn to

00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:23.570
reminiscence 

00:47:23.570 --> 00:47:24.749
future planning

00:47:24.749 --> 00:47:29.329
the kind of of mental chatter - I mentioned contemplative disciplines may refer to

00:47:29.329 --> 00:47:31.249
this as 'monkey mind'

00:47:31.249 --> 00:47:34.799
jumping from one branch to another one thing to another

00:47:34.799 --> 00:47:37.939
continuously after the been continuously distracted

00:47:37.939 --> 00:47:41.990
and so they are now a number of studies - some completed some ongoing -

00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:43.640
that are demonstrating that

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:45.480
these kinds of 

00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:49.840
mental training practices, attention training practices,

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:52.530
even for relatively short periods of time, an 8 week 

00:47:52.530 --> 00:47:54.329
kind of intensive practice

00:47:54.329 --> 00:47:57.199
makes a significant difference in attention

00:47:57.199 --> 00:48:01.199
and in encoding information into memory.

00:48:01.199 --> 00:48:05.909
In the case of amnesia is the metamemory affected?

00:48:05.909 --> 00:48:07.720
The question is, in the case of amnesia is metamemory affected?

00:48:09.519 --> 00:48:12.439
It depends on the kind of amnesia.

00:48:12.439 --> 00:48:16.610
So in the clinical mysteries that I started off with 

00:48:16.610 --> 00:48:17.049
the very first person has an amnesia or an 

00:48:17.049 --> 00:48:19.049
amnestic syndrome

00:48:19.049 --> 00:48:22.140
due to circumscribed or limited 

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:24.019
damage to these hippocampal bodies.

00:48:24.019 --> 00:48:27.539
That person does not have a metamemory impairment.

00:48:27.539 --> 00:48:30.180
But when the damage extends beyond

00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:31.789
those structures

00:48:31.789 --> 00:48:33.689
particularly into this

00:48:33.689 --> 00:48:36.029
middle frontal area 

00:48:36.029 --> 00:48:43.029
that's when metamemory is also impaired.

00:48:43.479 --> 00:48:49.900
I worked with many people who have had severe dementia and also Alzheimer's

00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:53.599
and most of them, before they died,  

00:48:53.599 --> 00:48:55.959
had moments of lucidity

00:48:55.959 --> 00:49:02.529
where they recognized people and they spoke and I was wondering how that could be.

00:49:02.529 --> 00:49:06.889
The question is that she works with people with Alzheimer's Disease 

00:49:06.889 --> 00:49:08.769
and other causes of dementia.

00:49:08.769 --> 00:49:10.680
And many of them before they die 

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:13.039
have moments of lucidity.

00:49:13.039 --> 00:49:14.960
of being clear, apparently. 

00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:16.429
It's a wonderful question

00:49:16.429 --> 00:49:18.169
and one that we don't have

00:49:18.169 --> 00:49:19.719
and the answer to.

00:49:19.719 --> 00:49:25.099
There's a very moving story time that some of you may have had come across of an individual

00:49:25.099 --> 00:49:27.379
with Alzheimer's Disease who 

00:49:27.379 --> 00:49:33.059
seemed just abysmally bad, was no longer recognizing any family members 

00:49:33.059 --> 00:49:37.019
not able to do very much at all for himself

00:49:37.019 --> 00:49:38.019
and

00:49:38.019 --> 00:49:40.049
within literally hours

00:49:40.049 --> 00:49:41.679
before he died

00:49:41.679 --> 00:49:43.530
said to his wife

00:49:43.530 --> 00:49:44.310
"I'm okay

00:49:44.310 --> 00:49:45.839
don't worry" 

00:49:45.839 --> 00:49:49.390
and passed away. How does that happen? 

00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:51.629
What goes on?

00:49:51.629 --> 00:49:53.420
What rallies in the brain?

00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:55.149
What changes happen

00:49:55.149 --> 00:49:56.799
as we approach that

00:49:56.799 --> 00:49:59.670
great mystery of death?

00:49:59.670 --> 00:50:02.299
We don't know. Wonderful question.

00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:05.829
I've been, from time to time,

00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:07.040
let's say 

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:12.189
appalled or overwhelmed by the vastness of my own memory.

00:50:12.189 --> 00:50:12.769
And 

00:50:12.769 --> 00:50:14.529
I have

00:50:14.529 --> 00:50:16.259
yet to find 

00:50:16.259 --> 00:50:20.009
the explanations for this on the personal level.

00:50:20.009 --> 00:50:23.869
I tend to lean toward 

00:50:23.869 --> 00:50:27.640
quantum physical processes to explain 

00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:28.660
the depth of it, 

00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:32.219
the expensiveness of it 

00:50:32.219 --> 00:50:36.269
the sense of the micro-cosmos of the medieval consciousness. 

00:50:36.269 --> 00:50:39.519
Thank you 

00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:45.650
so he is very impressed with the vastness, 

00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:50.519
how big his memory is. Men often think their memory is bigger

00:50:50.519 --> 00:50:57.519
memory is bigger than it actually is [laughter]

00:50:59.479 --> 00:51:00.469
[laughter]

00:51:00.469 --> 00:51:07.469
It's an optical illusion. [laughter]

00:51:09.919 --> 00:51:11.339
I'm sorry, you gave me an opening [laughter] 

00:51:11.339 --> 00:51:13.149
It's a wonderful question. 

00:51:13.149 --> 00:51:16.949
And what I would suggest is that

00:51:16.949 --> 00:51:22.359
we are likely to discover 

00:51:22.359 --> 00:51:24.880
we are likely to discover in years hence

00:51:26.479 --> 00:51:27.939
that our models

00:51:27.939 --> 00:51:29.829
of how the brain operates,

00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:32.959
that wonderful discussion that Dr. Tolbert

00:51:32.959 --> 00:51:36.940
provided you, those are our current models about what's really important

00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:38.319
synaptic communication

00:51:38.319 --> 00:51:39.509
in the brain.

00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:42.539
Speed of neural transmission when

00:51:42.539 --> 00:51:44.109
these other cells

00:51:44.109 --> 00:51:45.819
insulate and cover 

00:51:45.819 --> 00:51:47.599
the brain cells.

00:51:47.599 --> 00:51:49.309
But there are other things

00:51:49.309 --> 00:51:50.719
that's good one.

00:51:50.719 --> 00:51:52.829
A colleague of mine, Stuart Hameroff,

00:51:52.829 --> 00:51:55.809
works very hard and on

00:51:55.809 --> 00:51:59.719
a theoretical perspective in which quantum events in the brain

00:51:59.719 --> 00:52:01.690
thought until not so long ago

00:52:01.690 --> 00:52:05.599
to be theoretically impossible because the brain is a very warm environment in these

00:52:05.599 --> 00:52:07.799
things usually occur and super cold

00:52:07.799 --> 00:52:08.890
kind of temperatures

00:52:08.890 --> 00:52:10.759
more recent discovery suggesting

00:52:10.759 --> 00:52:12.439
some plausibility

00:52:12.439 --> 00:52:16.250
and that these phenomenon may play an important role

00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:20.459
in consciousness. Bby the way, for those of you who are interested in these very 

00:52:20.459 --> 00:52:25.069
big questions these philosophic questions, these questions make contact with

00:52:25.069 --> 00:52:27.289
theoretic physics and 

00:52:27.289 --> 00:52:29.269
other deep science dimensions

00:52:29.269 --> 00:52:32.039
there is a conference in Tucson coming up

00:52:32.039 --> 00:52:35.579
toward the science of consciousness it's going to occur in April

00:52:35.579 --> 00:52:39.940
Dr. Hameroff is now the director of our Center for Conscious to Study, something

00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:40.959
I used to

00:52:40.959 --> 00:52:42.210
direct 

00:52:42.210 --> 00:52:45.499
it's great fun, it's soup to nuts É 

00:52:45.499 --> 00:52:51.660
literally [laughter]

00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:53.459
Dean Ruiz: Before this turns into vaudeville, thank you so much

00:52:53.459 --> 00:52:54.839
thank you
