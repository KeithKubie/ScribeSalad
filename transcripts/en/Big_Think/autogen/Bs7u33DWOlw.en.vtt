well earthquakes are a weird kind of

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.030
well earthquakes are a weird kind of
 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.020
well earthquakes are a weird kind of
phenomenon in the following sense when

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.030
phenomenon in the following sense when
 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.100
phenomenon in the following sense when
we talk about the theory of plate

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.110
we talk about the theory of plate
 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.160
we talk about the theory of plate
tectonics the the working hypothesis is

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.170
tectonics the the working hypothesis is
 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.440
tectonics the the working hypothesis is
that it's a smooth motion of the place

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:20.450
that it's a smooth motion of the place
 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.440
that it's a smooth motion of the place
that the plates move over geologic time

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:23.450
that the plates move over geologic time
 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.310
that the plates move over geologic time
with predictable rates it's as if

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320
with predictable rates it's as if
 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.830
with predictable rates it's as if
they're kind of a slow movement of

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840
they're kind of a slow movement of
 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.229
they're kind of a slow movement of
traffic if you will everybody's sort of

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239
traffic if you will everybody's sort of
 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.420
traffic if you will everybody's sort of
moving at a rate that stays constant in

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430
moving at a rate that stays constant in
 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.119
moving at a rate that stays constant in
time but obviously earthquakes happen

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129
time but obviously earthquakes happen
 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.090
time but obviously earthquakes happen
earthquakes predominantly occur where

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100
earthquakes predominantly occur where
 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.350
earthquakes predominantly occur where
the plates interact with one another

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360
the plates interact with one another
 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.360
the plates interact with one another
along what we call plate boundaries

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370
along what we call plate boundaries
 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.639
along what we call plate boundaries
obviously sometimes those plate

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649
obviously sometimes those plate
 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.590
obviously sometimes those plate
boundaries are sideways like we have in

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600
boundaries are sideways like we have in
 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.690
boundaries are sideways like we have in
the San Andreas Fault or in the

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700
the San Andreas Fault or in the
 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.180
the San Andreas Fault or in the
earthquake that happened in Haiti

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190
earthquake that happened in Haiti
 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.490
earthquake that happened in Haiti
sometimes those boundaries are

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500
sometimes those boundaries are
 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.810
sometimes those boundaries are
compressional like what happened in

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820
compressional like what happened in
 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.450
compressional like what happened in
Chile or what might happen off the coast

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460
Chile or what might happen off the coast
 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.299
Chile or what might happen off the coast
of Seattle and sometimes those

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309
of Seattle and sometimes those
 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.510
of Seattle and sometimes those
boundaries are what we call extensional

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520
boundaries are what we call extensional
 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.920
boundaries are what we call extensional
the best example of this would be the

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930
the best example of this would be the
 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.810
the best example of this would be the
Basin and Range in the western United

so those three type of boundaries are

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350
so those three type of boundaries are
 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.100
so those three type of boundaries are
described what how the plates inter

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110
described what how the plates inter
 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.440
described what how the plates inter
interact but earthquakes of course are

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450
interact but earthquakes of course are
 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.749
interact but earthquakes of course are
not a continuous process by any means

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759
not a continuous process by any means
 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.669
not a continuous process by any means
they're really what we call a stick slip

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:24.679
they're really what we call a stick slip
 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:28.839
they're really what we call a stick slip
process so while the hypothesis of plate

00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:28.849
process so while the hypothesis of plate
 

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:30.580
process so while the hypothesis of plate
tectonics so the working model is that

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590
tectonics so the working model is that
 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.730
tectonics so the working model is that
the plates move at a relatively constant

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740
the plates move at a relatively constant
 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.880
the plates move at a relatively constant
rate at the boundaries they stick and

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890
rate at the boundaries they stick and
 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.550
rate at the boundaries they stick and
they slip the boundaries don't move at a

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560
they slip the boundaries don't move at a
 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.339
they slip the boundaries don't move at a
relatively constant rate instead the

00:01:42.339 --> 00:01:42.349
relatively constant rate instead the
 

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:45.609
relatively constant rate instead the
boundaries stick and when they stick the

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619
boundaries stick and when they stick the
 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:47.710
boundaries stick and when they stick the
movement of the plates stresses that

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720
movement of the plates stresses that
 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.870
movement of the plates stresses that
boundary and eventually that stress

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880
boundary and eventually that stress
 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.150
boundary and eventually that stress
overcomes the strength of that boundary

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160
overcomes the strength of that boundary
 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.249
overcomes the strength of that boundary
and it breaks and that breakage is an

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259
and it breaks and that breakage is an
 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.499
and it breaks and that breakage is an
earthquake it's sort of our what we call

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509
earthquake it's sort of our what we call
 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.080
earthquake it's sort of our what we call
a stick slip model or we have other

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090
a stick slip model or we have other
 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.460
a stick slip model or we have other
names for it but that's basically what

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470
names for it but that's basically what
 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.120
names for it but that's basically what
happens the problem that we face as

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130
happens the problem that we face as
 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.859
happens the problem that we face as
earthquakes seismologists is that

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869
earthquakes seismologists is that
 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.650
earthquakes seismologists is that
sticking and slipping is almost a

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660
sticking and slipping is almost a
 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.020
sticking and slipping is almost a
chaotic process not quiet but almost and

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030
chaotic process not quiet but almost and
 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.089
chaotic process not quiet but almost and
so it's very difficult to predict on a

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099
so it's very difficult to predict on a
 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.940
so it's very difficult to predict on a
day-to-day basis over geologic time of

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950
day-to-day basis over geologic time of
 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.450
day-to-day basis over geologic time of
course it's very predictable we can

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460
course it's very predictable we can
 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.610
course it's very predictable we can
get an idea of where the active plate

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620
get an idea of where the active plate
 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.310
get an idea of where the active plate
boundaries are those plate boundaries of

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320
boundaries are those plate boundaries of
 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.600
boundaries are those plate boundaries of
course are major faults in the earth and

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610
course are major faults in the earth and
 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.800
course are major faults in the earth and
we know where the earthquakes will occur

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810
we know where the earthquakes will occur
 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.500
we know where the earthquakes will occur
but because we can't predict the stick

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510
but because we can't predict the stick
 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.530
but because we can't predict the stick
and slip cycle very well of certainly

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540
and slip cycle very well of certainly
 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.960
and slip cycle very well of certainly
over human timescales we can't really

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970
over human timescales we can't really
 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.990
over human timescales we can't really
get what we call a prediction but

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000
get what we call a prediction but
 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.340
get what we call a prediction but
there's a deeper understanding of it

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350
there's a deeper understanding of it
 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.890
there's a deeper understanding of it
that that allows us to forecast instead

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900
that that allows us to forecast instead
 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.770
that that allows us to forecast instead
of predict and by forecast I mean well

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780
of predict and by forecast I mean well
 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:48.880
of predict and by forecast I mean well
first of all we know where they occur

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890
first of all we know where they occur
 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:49.660
first of all we know where they occur
because we know what the plate

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670
because we know what the plate
 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.900
because we know what the plate
boundaries are but we can get a sense of

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910
boundaries are but we can get a sense of
 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.580
boundaries are but we can get a sense of
what the probability of an earthquake

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590
what the probability of an earthquake
 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.150
what the probability of an earthquake
might be in two ways one by looking at

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160
might be in two ways one by looking at
 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.640
might be in two ways one by looking at
the past history and if we have enough

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650
the past history and if we have enough
 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:01.960
the past history and if we have enough
earthquakes we can sort of get a

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970
earthquakes we can sort of get a
 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.630
earthquakes we can sort of get a
statistical model of when and

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640
statistical model of when and
 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.940
statistical model of when and
earthquakes might occur and that gives

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950
earthquakes might occur and that gives
 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.280
earthquakes might occur and that gives
us some probability and the other is to

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290
us some probability and the other is to
 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.100
us some probability and the other is to
actually do a bit of forward modeling

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110
actually do a bit of forward modeling
 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.530
actually do a bit of forward modeling
and actually take the plate motions take

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540
and actually take the plate motions take
 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.080
and actually take the plate motions take
a model of the friction along the plate

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090
a model of the friction along the plate
 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.720
a model of the friction along the plate
boundary take a model of how the stress

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730
boundary take a model of how the stress
 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.150
boundary take a model of how the stress
builds up and sort of predict when and

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160
builds up and sort of predict when and
 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.000
builds up and sort of predict when and
where or I should say forecast when the

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010
where or I should say forecast when the
 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.980
where or I should say forecast when the
next earthquake might occur and it's

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990
next earthquake might occur and it's
 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.970
next earthquake might occur and it's
gotten to the point where we could

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980
gotten to the point where we could
 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.160
gotten to the point where we could
probably do that over the span of a

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170
probably do that over the span of a
 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.160
probably do that over the span of a
decade or two perhaps 30 years to the

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170
decade or two perhaps 30 years to the
 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.430
decade or two perhaps 30 years to the
extent that we can sort of provide an

extent that we can sort of provide an

course we didn't have that for Haiti we

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520
course we didn't have that for Haiti we
 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.150

you know one of the exciting parts of
 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.240
you know one of the exciting parts of
earthquake seismology is that the better

we get at forecasting earthquakes the
 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.370
we get at forecasting earthquakes the
closer we might actually come to a

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380
closer we might actually come to a
 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.130
closer we might actually come to a
prediction that is useful on human
