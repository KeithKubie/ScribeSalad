disease like a prime these are deletable
so both of these genes have been deleted

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139
so both of these genes have been deleted
 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:38.370
so both of these genes have been deleted
for various animals and without

safety increase and then finally we have

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300
safety increase and then finally we have
 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.850

not transmitted to humans and malaria is

not transmitted to humans and malaria is
 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.130
