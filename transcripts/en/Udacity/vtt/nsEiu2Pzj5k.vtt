00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.510
Welcome to the project phase in this class. We hope

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.620
you can now leverage what you've learned so far into

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.020
solving more complicated problems. The problem we've created for you

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.790
is not an official one. It's called the Runaway Robot Project,

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.470
and the scope of this project is to chase a

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.950
robot that is trying to escape. The very first version has

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.500
full observability, and your task is to find out whether

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.440
or what is the new status information about his heading direction.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.150
So, dive in, read the instruction on top

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.540
of the exercise, and try to solve the problem.
