00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.070
In fact around 70% of

non surgical specialists report
improved care coordination.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.771
A key result given what you've learned
about the fragmented approach to

00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:24.418
managing chronic disease.

00:00:24.418 --> 00:00:30.325
