00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.814
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:05.070
- Hi, everybody.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.330
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.360
- I'm Jane Kamensky.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.110
I'm the faculty director
of the Schlesinger Library.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.810
And I want to welcome
you to this panel

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.190
discussion of rediscovering
Pauline Murray, who has never

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.050
really been
undiscovered, but seems

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.560
to be having quite a moment now.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.010
I'm going to just say a little
bit about what this event means

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.280
to Schlesinger, what our
particular claim to Murray's

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.970
legacy and her claim
on our interest is,

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.960
and then introduce my colleague,
Dr. Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham,

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.730
who is going to introduce
the panel, which

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.360
will proceed in a true
conversational format.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.260
So we've all been so excited
in the last couple of years

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.910
as more and more new work about
the life and legacy of Pauli

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:58.540
Murray has come out with
Dr. Patricia Bell-Scott's

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.700
award-winning and much
noticed book, The Firebrand

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.190
and the First Lady; last year,
with Rosalind Rosenberg's

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.780
eminent book, Jane Crow, a
cradle-to-grave biography

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.420
of Murray forthcoming
next week; and

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.690
with important chapter-length
and article-length work

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.350
on Murray by Ken Mack in
the Harvard Law School,

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.530
and Brittney Cooper at
Rutgers, and many more.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.110
Schlesinger takes particular
interest in all things

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.390
Pauli Murray because
we are the repository

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.900
of her extensive
collection of papers.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.960
And I just wanted to tell you
how big this collection is.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.650
So the collection began
to come to us in 1970.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.610
And then more installments
proceeded by will

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.870
in the wake of Pauli
Murray's death in 1985.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:59.440
And it now comprises 58
linear feet, 135 file boxes,

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.640
5 half-file boxes, 2 folio
boxes, 12 folio folders,

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.290
and on and on.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.889
The finding aid
runs to 220 pages

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.160
which is a biography
in and of itself,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.550
and also shows the meticulous
work that the library does

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.380
describing things.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.430
The index to the finding
aid begins with the AARP

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.950
and ends with Philip
Zwerling, which

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.340
shows some of the
range of contacts

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.390
that Murray had over
her life and activism

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.790
in many different directions.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.630
We want to have a
multifaceted discussion

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.500
of Murray's biography,
and work, and legacy

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.510
with scholars who
have thought about her

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.520
from many different directions.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.520
And presiding over the panel
is my colleague, Evelyn Brooks

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.230
Higginbotham, who is Victor
S. Thomas Professor of History

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.050
and of African, African-American
Studies at Harvard.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.690
She is herself a
pioneer in the history

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.260
of African American
women, not least,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.490
but not only with her important,
book Righteous Discontent--

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.500
The Women's Movement
in the Black Baptist

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.620
Church, 1880 to 1920.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.620
I think one of the
exciting things about this,

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.710
not only interdisciplinary,
but intergenerational panel,

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.800
is Brittney Cooper's forthcoming
book engages very fully

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.550
with the terms of discourse
that Evelyn Higginbotham set out

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.710
in that pioneering book.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.930
So Evelyn, if you
will take it from here

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.310
and introduce the rest
of the panel, thanks.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.760
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.470
- I'm going to invite you-- why
don't you come on up and sit

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:46.470
down now so that we can
just immediately start?

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.870
It is really a pleasure
to be here today.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.260
There's so much to
discover and discover

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.980
and to rediscover
about Pauli Murray

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:03.040
that I think the title of this
symposium is quite appropriate.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.590
I'd like to tell you what
we're going to do today.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.230
We're going to have
a conversation.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.510
And we will-- each
one of the panelists--

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.130
will answer a question.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.959
And they will talk about some of
the things that they've found.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.530
And then around 5:30, we
will open it up to you

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.790
so that you can ask
questions of them.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.090
Our first speaker will
be Patricia Bell-Scott.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.130
And I'll just read
according to the way

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.170
that they are sitting here too.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.990
She is professor emerita
of women's studies

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.330
and human development
and family science

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.280
at the University of Georgia.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.820
She is the author, as you
heard, of The Firebrand

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.380
and the First Lady--

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.420
Portrait of a Friendship--

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.570
Pauli Murray, Eleanor
Roosevelt, and the Struggle

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.760
for Social Justice.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.840
And this book was a finalist
for the Carnegie Medal

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.030
for Excellence in Nonfiction.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.730
It was also nominated
for the National Book

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.100
Award in Nonfiction.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.760
It has just received
all kinds of accolades.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.460
I have known Patricia
Bell-Scott for decades

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.040
as we remembered our
days in day school

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.200
together when we were
among the founding

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.090
people in Women's History.

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.840
And Patricia Bell-Scott is
really an amazing pioneer.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.960
She is a co-founder of the
National Women's Studies

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.340
Association.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.510
She served for a decade as
co-founding editor of Sage.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.910
She's written a number
of prize-winning books.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.710
But my all time favorite is her
co-authorship of All the Women

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:47.190
Are White, All the Blacks Are
Men, But Some Of Us Are Brave.

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.880
So I want to thank
you, Patricia,

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.150
for brave because this is one
of the first women's studies

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.260
textbooks to address race,
class, and sexuality.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.080
Brittney Cooper is
assistant professor

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.340
of women's and gender
studies and Africana studies

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.320
at Rutgers University.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.035
And I must tell you, she
has just received tenure.

00:06:08.035 --> 00:06:10.186
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:14.533 --> 00:06:18.460
And so we want to
recognize that.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.950
She teaches courses on
black feminist theory,

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.880
black intellectual thought,
hip-hop, gender, and the media.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.610
And her first book,
Beyond Respectability--

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.860
The Intellectual
Thought of Race Women

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.350
will be released next
month from the University

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:33.430

Collection released earlier this
year from the Feminist Press.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.400
And she's a scholar.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.500
She's also quite a
public intellectual.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.790
And she's well-known on radio,
podcasts, and television.

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:53.560
Rosalind Rosenberg, professor
of history emerita at Barnard

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.740
is another pioneering
figure in women's history.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.740
She taught at Columbia
and Wesleyan Universities

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.610
before coming to Barnard, where
she taught American women's

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:08.410
gender and legal history
until her retirement in 2011.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.860
Her books include Beyond
Separate Spheres--

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.790

Feminism, Divided Lives--

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:18.110

and most recently, Jane Crow--

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.170
The Life of Pauli Murray.

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:27.850
And finally, Kenneth Mack is
the Inaugural Lawrence D. Biele

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.580
Professor of Law and
affiliate professor

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.350
of history at Harvard.

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:35.500
He is currently a Radcliffe
Fellow at the Radcliffe

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.630
Institute for Advanced Study.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:41.950
His 2012 book,
Representing the Race--

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:45.400
The Creation of the
Civil Rights Lawyer,

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.420
was a Washington Post
Best Book of the Year--

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:53.020
one of their Best Books of the
Year; a National Book Festival

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:57.280
selection; and it was also a
finalist for several awards.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.370
He is also the co-editor
of The New Black--

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:05.710
What Has Changed-- and What
Has Not-- with Race in America.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:08.790
He's also co-editor
of-- well, that.

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:12.550
That in that came out in 2013.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.450
So we will begin.

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.530
Can everybody hear me?

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:24.630
Well, it's quite a pleasure.

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:26.880
I'm already hooked up.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.810
But you are going to be
speaking in the microphone.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:34.299
So let me start
with you, Patricia.

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:37.140
In your illuminating
book on the friendship

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:40.710
between Pauli Murray
and Eleanor Roosevelt,

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:43.559
she calls Eleanor
Roosevelt "ER".

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:47.220
But you begin with the
words from a letter

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.980
that Pauli Murray wrote to you.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:53.310
Now that was impressive.

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.710
In 1983, you
received this letter.

00:08:55.710 --> 00:09:00.210
And you state that one of the
reasons you undertook the study

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:04.530
was piqued by a reference
to ER that was found

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:06.450
in Murray's letter to you.

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.120
So tell us more about
why and how you began

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.070
this intellectual journey.

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:14.700
- I want to start by saying
that I was introduced to Pauli

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:19.680
Murray in the early 1970s when
I was a young faculty member

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.440
developing a course on
African-American women.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.250
Can you hear me?

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:24.600
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.170
- Not well?

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:30.900
Can you hear me now?

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:31.746
- Yes.

00:09:31.746 --> 00:09:33.120
- I'm going to
have to lean over.

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:38.640
I was introduced to
Pauli Murray in the 1970s

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.960
when I was developing a course
on African-American women.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.000
I discovered her
memoir, Proud Shoes.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.100
She had not yet
entered the ministry

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.530
or published her autobiography.

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:53.400
But I soon discovered that she
was a person of many talents.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.490
I tracked down her poetry
collection, which was out

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:59.130
of print; some of
her legal essays;

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:01.920
as well as some of
her opinion pieces.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.320
Her feminist writings,
such as the essay,

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.920
"The Liberation of Black
Women," spoke to me at a time

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:13.050
when I was in the midst of
three career-shifting projects.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:16.230
I was involved in the founding
of the National Women's Studies

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:17.430
Association.

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:21.960
I was co-auditing the textbook,
But Some of Us Are Brave.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.380
And I was co-founding
the journal, Sage.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:28.530
These last two projects-- the
textbook and the journal--

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:30.630
caught Murray's attention.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:34.950
And she reacted as she often
did when something stirred her.

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:38.070
She shot off two letters.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:40.200
The first letter
concerned her irritation

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.240
with Newsweek
Magazine which had run

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.390
a feature on women's studies,
ignoring the contributions

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:48.120
of black women in our textbook.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.690
Dear Sisters-- Pauli Murray
wrote to us on November 25,

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:53.100
1983--

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.440
if Newsweek doesn't see
the value of your work,

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.230
here's an old-timer who does.

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.120
So be encouraged.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.160
It can be done.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:06.360
This reference to herself is
an old-timer makes me smile.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.090
She was only 73.

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:15.180
And now that I have my Medicare
card, it seems young to me.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:18.810
Her second missive-- dated
December 12th, 1983--

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:22.740
came after I invited her
to join the board of Sage.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:26.220
That missive was sprinkled with
encouragement for our group,

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.620
with admiration for
the women activists

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.720
who had taken the
lessons that they

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.840
had learned in the labor
and civil rights movements

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.420
and applied them to
the women's movement.

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:40.710
And it also had fond mention
of the President's Commission

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:42.480
on the Status of
Women, for which

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.310
Murray had been a
subcommittee member,

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:48.300
and to which John F. Kennedy
had appointed Eleanor

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.940
Roosevelt as Commission Chair.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.580
Murray's letter
also carried a line

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:59.400
that made me feel as if she were
pointing her finger in my face.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.250
She said, "Dear Pat,
You need to know

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:04.860
some of the veterans of the
battle whose shoulders you now

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:06.570
stand on."

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:10.770
I was an all-knowing
32-year-old at the time.

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:14.350
And that directive
made me squirm.

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:16.060
Prior commitments
prevented Murray

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.500
from contributing to Sage
because she was working

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.190
furiously on her autobiography.

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:24.810
And although I dashed off
an appreciative reply,

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:27.210
I never got the
chance to ask her

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:30.090
about the veterans
whose shoulders I stood.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:35.610
Her death 18 months later, at
age 74 from pancreatic cancer,

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:37.450
caught me off guard.

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:39.480
Having knowledge
of her illness, I

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.840
had respected her wish
to write undisturbed.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.120
I was distraught to
learn of her death

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.910
and thought that I might
write something about her.

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:49.800
But having a full
plate at the time,

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.520
I convinced myself that
whatever I wanted to do

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.350
would have to wait.

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:58.770
But somehow or other, her
lines, the words in that letter,

00:12:58.770 --> 00:12:59.940
kept bothering me.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:04.470
And I finally decided to go
back to the notion of looking

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:08.370
at this friendship between
Pauli and Eleanor Roosevelt

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:11.700
that she intimated in a letter.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.050
And I made this decision
for several reasons.

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:17.580
First of all, I have always
had a personal and a research

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:21.600
interest in women's friendships
and women's personal writings,

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.960
particularly
letters and diaries.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.900
I immediately recognized
when I took a look-- just

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.990
a quick look-- at the
correspondence between Pauli

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:33.330
and Eleanor, that
there was more there

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.310
and that it deserved
attention beyond what

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:39.360
is mentioned by previous
biographers and historians.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.610
My sense of being
drawn into the project

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:44.490
was affirmed four years
into the research when

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:49.770
I came across an August 19,
1971 letter to her friend,

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:53.880
the historian Caroline Ware, in
which Murray spoke of the notes

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.780
that she was making for a future
biographer whose work probably

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.450
would not be published
in her lifetime.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:03.480
I felt a haunting presence,
as if Murray were hovering

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.810
near my writing desk, when I
read that she had envisioned

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:09.300
a biography that
began with her battle

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:12.300
to enroll at the University
of North Carolina

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:16.110
and the friendship with Mrs. R.
That I had responded to a wish

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:18.900
Murray made long before
I imagined this book,

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.570
confirmed my instinct
that her letter to me

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:23.490
was more than coincidence--

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:27.070
that she was, indeed, not only
pointing her finger in my face

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:29.910
but pointing me in a direction.

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:31.710
Let me make a few
comments about what

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:36.240
I learned in the spirit of
discovering and rediscovery.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.120
First of all, I discovered that
the decades-long friendship

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:42.420
with Eleanor Roosevelt, whom
Murray would describe later

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:44.850
as a maternal figure,
was a place of growth

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:46.350
and acceptance--

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:49.170
that Murray could test
her intellectual powers

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:51.960
in this relationship
and that she never felt

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:56.130
rejected because of her beliefs
or who she was, was vital

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:58.590
to her well-being
and dare I say,

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:01.560
to Eleanor's growing
understanding of race

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:06.270
and the complex discrimination
African-American women suffer.

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:08.250
I discovered that
the personality

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:10.620
traits that we've come
to associate with Murray

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:14.370
as an adult were
evident in girlhood.

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:16.740
She was an
independent spirit who

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:18.600
preferred working
alone as opposed

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.570
to in groups because she
was almost always ahead

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:23.370
of the curve in her thinking.

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:26.610
She was impatient with
convention and bureaucracies.

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:29.400
And she was often simply
smarter than the people

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.650
with whom she had to work.

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:34.710
She was willing to challenge
inequality and authority

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:37.380
figures head-on no
matter who they were.

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.840
Indeed, she filed
her first complaint

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.600
against discrimination
over the breakfast table

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.120
when she was barely
six years old,

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:49.170
when she asked Aunt Colleen,
how come you give grandfather

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:52.890
three pancakes and me only one?

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:55.890
And she never stopped asking
hard questions, no matter

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:58.470
how brash or inappropriate.

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:01.770
I discovered that
she was innately shy

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:03.510
and that she was
most comfortable,

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:07.320
and at her best, expressing
herself on the written page.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.600
I discovered that she
was warm and loving,

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:13.290
that she refused to accept
medical or cultural definitions

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:16.530
of her gender identity
and sexual orientation.

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:18.600
I discovered that
the challenges she

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:22.590
faced having to do with
gender identity and sexuality

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:25.560
were compounded by
health problems, the most

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:30.270
persistent of these
being a long-term smoking

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:34.830
addiction, thyroid disease that
was manifested in mood swings

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:38.385
and not diagnosed until
she was in her mid life.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:44.610
She also suffered
intermittently from exhaustion

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:46.350
and malnutrition.

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:49.260
All of these factors
impacted her overall sense

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:53.070
of well-being, her temperament,
her employment, work

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:55.380
performance, and relationships.

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:57.390
I discovered that
the tragic death

00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:01.920
of Murray's seven-month pregnant
mother of a cerebral hemorrhage

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.589
and the racially-motivated
murder of her father

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:08.310
in a mental hospital when
he was an inmate, as well

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:10.589
as her experience
as a child raised

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:14.960
by racially proud elderly kin
who were churchgoing school

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.849
teachers, nurtured
her compassion

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:20.400
for the vulnerable
and chronically ill,

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.310
her intellectual
curiosity, her love

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:26.160
of African-American
literature and history,

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.870
and her devotion to the church.

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:31.590
Finally, I continued
to be awed by how

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:34.530
methodically and
relentlessly she worked

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:37.770
to become an integrated
person, embracing

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:40.920
the fullness of all her
interest, abilities,

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.210
and identities.

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:44.970
In fact, I particularly
like a little letter

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:48.030
that she sent to friends
explaining this quest

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:50.050
for wholeness in her life.

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:53.160
And it was written during the
early days of her ministry

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:57.330
when she said, "We bring
our total selves to God--

00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:02.440
our sexuality, our joyousness,
our foolishness, et cetera,

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.880
et cetera."

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:07.360
And this is how I hope that
we as scholars, artists,

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:10.200
and activists can
and will examine

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.080
her life in its fullness.

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:13.710
- Thank you.

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:16.644
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.110
Now Brittney, in
your remarkable book,

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:26.470
Beyond Respectability,
you analyze black women's

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:29.950
intellectual discourse
as it was articulated

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:32.050
over the course of the
entire 20th century,

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:36.760
actually, and with attention
to the sexism inherent in Jane

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.260
Crow politics.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.570
And that's Murray's
term, of course--

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:43.270
and also in
respectability politics

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:47.240
with its own gender-disciplining
implications.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:53.170
So I'd like for you to elaborate
on this issue of respectability

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:57.670
and Jane Crow.

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:00.670
And do that in regard to
your own interesting theory--

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:03.340
because you have an interesting
theory on black gender

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:04.330
socialization.

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:05.770
So tell us about that.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:06.670
- Sure.

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:09.100
Thank you so much
for the question.

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.050
I hope you all
know how excited I

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:13.540
am to be sitting at this table
with these luminary folks

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:17.050
because I know that they've made
it possible for me to be here

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:18.440
and for me to do this work.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:24.139
And so thank you and
thank you and also

00:19:24.139 --> 00:19:25.930
because we get to call
Pauli Murray's name.

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:29.560
And we should do that every
time we have the opportunity.

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:33.580
So in my new book,
Beyond Respectability,

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:36.220
I try to situate and
understand Dr. Pauli

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:39.100
Murray within a long line
of race women thinkers

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:40.990
and public intellectuals
who reshaped

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:44.080
our ideas about gender, race,
and leadership over the course

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.574
of the 20th century.

00:19:45.574 --> 00:19:47.740
And one of the drums that
I tried to beat in my book

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:49.281
is to say, what does
it actually look

00:19:49.281 --> 00:19:51.550
like to take black
women seriously

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:52.930
as thinkers and theorists?

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:53.950
We say that we do this.

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:57.470
And yet sometimes, it's not
clear in the work that we do.

00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:58.900
So I think it is
really important

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:03.070
to say that it matters that
Murray names this concept

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:04.390
of Jane Crow at Howard--

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:06.970
also my alma mater--

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:09.730
a very pro-black and
pro-male intellectual

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:13.300
space when she's a law
student there in the 1940s.

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:16.860
Jane Crow was not simply a
fancy way of naming sexism.

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:19.390
She wasn't merely being clever.

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:21.310
It was, in particular,
a way to articulate

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:24.790
the politics of sexism coming
out of black communities that

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:27.370
had a deeply sophisticated
analysis of the perils

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:28.930
of Jim Crow.

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:31.450
So in my book, I
argue that quote,

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:33.490
"In addition to being
an early formulation

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:36.100
of intersectional
theory, Jane Crow

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:38.620
also sought to name
a powerful system

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:42.250
of gender disciplining within
black intellectual communities.

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:44.710
This system propped
up by deep investments

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:47.740
in the hetero norms of
respectability politics

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:50.350
demanded proper
sexual and gender

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:54.100
performances from black women if
they desired to be race leaders

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.890
and attempted to silence,
humiliate, and isolate them

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:59.170
when they chose not to comply."

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:01.210
So commensurate with
the cultural and gender

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:04.970
disciplining that Pauli
Murray experienced at Howard,

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:08.560
it was there, I argue, that
she became a race woman.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:12.040
So let me say more about
what I mean by that.

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:15.160
And first, I want to say that
I approached Dr. Higginbotham's

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.800
expansive and pioneering
formulation of respectability

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:22.310
politics in this book in ways.

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:24.740
Let me let's talk more
about how I approach it

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.980
and think about
it as particularly

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:30.880
relevant because Murray's
articulation of Jane Crow

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.880
politics is deeply
tethered to black ideas

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.620
about respectability.

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:38.350
So I argue that respectability
politics did not

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:41.110
emerge after enslavement and
the end of Reconstruction

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:44.410
as simply a survival
strategy or simply

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:46.370
as a mode of public engagement.

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:48.250
It was certainly those things.

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:53.350
But I argue that
respectability discourse also

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:57.370
constituted one of the earliest
theorizations of gender itself

00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:59.650
within newly emancipated
black communities.

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:03.100
So Anna Julia Cooper, the
pioneering 19th century

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:07.270
thinker, argued in her 1892
book, A Voice From the South,

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:10.600
that black people were quote,
"the inheritors of a manhood

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:13.990
and womanhood
impoverished and de-based

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:17.870
by two centuries and more of
compression and degradation."

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:21.927
So her argument was that black
people got gender concepts that

00:22:21.927 --> 00:22:24.010
came out of enslavement
that were not particularly

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:27.097
useful for articulating a
notion of black humanity

00:22:27.097 --> 00:22:29.680
in any way that would make the
argument that black people were

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.330
worthy of protection.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:34.450
So respectability
politics, though it engaged

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:37.540
in a significant amount of
gender and class policing,

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:40.300
was really an attempt, I
argue, by black communities

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:43.750
to both articulate and
produce legible categories

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:45.940
of black manhood
and black womanhood.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:49.100
It's not simply enough to see
it as a survival strategy.

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:51.700
It's also important to see
these black people coming out

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.130
of the period of enslavement
and Reconstruction,

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:57.160
as well deeply invested in
creating gender categories that

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.992
would articulate black humanity.

00:22:58.992 --> 00:23:00.700
And so that means
respecting black people

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.740
as theorists of
their own condition,

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:05.170
as theorists of gender,
and then thinking

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:08.590
about Pauli Murray as herself,
a theorist of gender identity,

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:10.690
not merely a performer
or a participant

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:13.330
in existing definitions.

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:15.070
So by the time
Pauli Murray made it

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:18.130
to Howard Law
School in the 1940s,

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:20.430
she had reached the
institutional vanguard

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:22.680
for the performance of black
respectable achievements.

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.120
And I'm critiquing
my institution

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.880
because it's my institution.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.610
The quest for
civil rights, which

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:32.790
Howard was deeply invested
in, unfortunately,

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:37.140
encoded within it an expectation
of respectable black behavior.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:40.020
So Murray's insistence on
living in the tension of gender

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:43.710
nonconformity disrupted existing
black theories of gender--

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:46.830
theories and ideas that many
black communities were deeply

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:50.540
invested in because they saw
the de-gendering processes--

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:53.070
Hortense Spillers
talks about it--

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:55.140
in slavery as one
that had left them

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:57.330
with impoverished and
bankrupt conceptions of gender

00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:58.810
in the first place.

00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:00.600
So it is in that
context, then, that I

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:04.410
argue for two important
understandings of Jane Crow.

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:06.180
One is, of course,
to see it as part

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:09.330
of the early formulation of
intersectionality theorizing

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:11.550
and to think about it in
the intellectual history

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:13.631
of critical race
theory, to think about

00:24:13.631 --> 00:24:15.630
in terms of the work that
Kimberly Crenshaw will

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:18.480
come along as a legal professor
and do a couple of decades

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.510
later.

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:21.270
But I also think
it's important to see

00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:25.050
Jane Crow as participating
in a culture of, what I call,

00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:27.960
gender disciplining
necessary to uphold

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.870
both black respectability
politics and existing

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:33.930
black gender conceptions.

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:36.480
Let me say, then, a bit more
about Murray's time at Howard

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.730
so that we can
have full context.

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:40.590
So despite the
auspiciousness of Howard's

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:42.690
intellectual and
political culture,

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:46.630
Murray bore the brunt of deeply
ingrained sexist practices.

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:48.709
She was the only female
student in her class.

00:24:48.709 --> 00:24:50.250
And because of that,
she was excluded

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:52.550
from joining the campus
legal fraternity.

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:54.130
And when she
confronted the dean--

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:56.940
and I think many of us will say
that she was always confronting

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:58.680
somebody--

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.470
so when she confronted Dean
Leon Ransom about this obviously

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:03.150
exclusive process,
he told her to start

00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:05.220
her own legal sorority.

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:07.530
She perceived her
exclusion from the quote,

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:10.350
"fraternity of lawyers who would
make civil rights history,"

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:12.270
not as an isolated
case of sexism

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:15.510
but rather as a representative
case of a larger practice

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:18.150
of sexist exclusion
among many of the most

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:20.370
notable civil rights pioneers.

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:22.800
The discovery, wrote Murray,
that Ransom and other men

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:25.500
I deeply admired because
of their dedication

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.900
to civil rights, men
who themselves suffered

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:29.849
racial indignities
could countenance

00:25:29.849 --> 00:25:32.265
the exclusion of women from
their professional association

00:25:32.265 --> 00:25:34.950
aroused an incipient
feminism in me

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:39.300
long before I knew the
meaning of the term feminism.

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:41.670
Her experience with the
intellectual and political

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:43.850
culture at Howard
involved, then,

00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:46.890
a kind of cultural disciplining
and gender policing designed

00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:50.490
to force Murray into her place.

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:53.220
Dealing with the kinds of
racial masculinity propagated

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:56.040
at Howard is sort of race
normative masculinity

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.930
about what respectable
black manhood should

00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:01.482
look like and appear to be,
and the deliberate exclusion

00:26:01.482 --> 00:26:03.690
from certain privileges on
account of her femaleness,

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:05.730
certainly didn't help matters.

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:08.040
When Murray confronted the
politics of racial manhood

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.980
in operation at Howard,
she also confronted a kind

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:13.500
of racial disciplining
that uncoated a demand

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.170
for strict gender conformity.

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:18.360
Racial respectability
demanded not only

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.250
heteronormative gender
role performances

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:24.210
and sexual relations, but also
cisgender identity performances

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:24.710
as well.

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:25.209
And

00:26:25.209 --> 00:26:27.510
That's one of the things
that Murray helps us to see--

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:29.660
that even before we have
the language of trans

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:31.710
and cis, which we use today--

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:33.840
that there was still
the expectation

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.370
that black people,
if they wanted

00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:38.130
to be respectable and have
any sort of public face,

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:40.170
would indeed be cisgender.

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:41.940
So she's living out
the politics of this

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:43.440
even though the
language hasn't been

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.290
invented to articulate
the harms and the stakes

00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:48.540
of such practices.

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:51.180
Though she was clearly committed
to the uplift of her race,

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.580
Murray, as many of
us know, struggled

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.100
to quote, "become a woman."

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.170
Her own personal
process of becoming

00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:01.740
coincides with her recognition
and increasing acknowledgement

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:05.460
of sexism and embrace of
feminism as a response to it.

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:08.460
Feminism, then, and in
particular her experience

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:12.060
and naming of Jane Crow, helped
Murray to reconcile herself

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:14.190
with femaleness and womanhood.

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:16.500
But she chose to acknowledge
the biological fact

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:18.570
of her femaleness
and came to believe

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:20.010
in a set of
political commitments

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:22.170
that challenge sexism.

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:25.680
This process at Howard,
this naming of Jane Crow,

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.600
was part of the
process by which she

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.460
came to embrace her
identity as a woman

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:32.100
because naming the
discrimination that she faced

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:33.510
was part of her
process of coming

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:36.250
into a particular kind
of gender identity.

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:38.730
So then I argue finally,
that Jane Crow also

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:42.200
named a sociospatial
race and gender formation

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.950
in the context of
black institutions,

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:47.280
like Howard, that shaped black
women as knowledge producers

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.360
and race leaders.

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.630
And whereas intersexual
approaches have always sought

00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:55.350
to make black women socially and
juridically legible, Jane Crow,

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:57.570
Murray's concept
and theorization,

00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:00.480
exposed the ways in which the
culture of legal institutions

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:04.500
in the civil rights era
symbolized by Howard Law School

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:07.230
both reified definitions
of womanhood--

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:09.450
even as it fought to
make them more visible--

00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:11.160
but reified definitions
in ways that

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:14.010
could both limit and harm
queer and gender non-conforming

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:15.690
persons like Murray.

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:17.880
Thus, Jane Crow is
also deeply rooted

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.390
in a black intellectual
history context that

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:23.500
sought not only to
institutionalize particular

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:25.240
definitions of
racial freedom, i.e.

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.430
The quest for civil
rights, but also to

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:31.690
formalize a narrative of proper
race manhood and womanhood.

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:34.540
Consequently, I argue
that it was at Howard

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:38.110
that Murray became not only a
woman but also a race woman.

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:39.290
Thank you.

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:39.920
- Thank you.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.722
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:46.458 --> 00:28:49.430
Well, Rosalind,
reading the first page

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:52.190
of your amazing biography
of Pauli Murray,

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:55.280
I was immediately
struck, as some of you

00:28:55.280 --> 00:29:02.330
will be, when you read that
Murray's many accomplishments,

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:10.190
so you argue, occurred in so
many arenas at the very time

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:11.750
she struggled.

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:14.150
And this is the
interesting phrase.

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:19.370
I quote Rosalind, "With
what we would today

00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:22.790
call a transgender identity."

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:25.460
Now what led you to believe
that her struggles over

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:28.430
her gender identity
were far more

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:30.445
than a source of personal pain?

00:29:30.445 --> 00:29:31.820
Because what you're
saying is not

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:36.950
just that she was pained about
this transgender identity

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:38.930
or confused about it.

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:43.310
You're arguing that those
very struggles over her gender

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:48.230
identity actually shaped all
of her political and social and

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:49.890
legal insights.

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:51.280
So talk about that.

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:57.350
- Struggling with that idea
made me take a very long time

00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:58.160
with this book.

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:08.600
Murray lived in her head even
more than most academics do.

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.670
And late in her life,
she told a friend

00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:16.970
that God had given her a male
brain inside a female-ish body.

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:20.900
And she'd felt this way for
as long as she could remember.

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:25.130
As a child, Murray had worn
boys' clothes, engaged in boys'

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:27.860
activities, read boys' books.

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:31.070
The neighbors laughed,
but she persisted.

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:35.300
You may have noticed in the
advertisement for this panel

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:39.770
a picture of Pauli Murray
in a Boy Scout uniform.

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:44.750
That picture was taken
when Pauli was 20 years old

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:49.710
on a hitch hiking trip that
took her through Bridgeport,

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:56.270
Connecticut, where she
was detained by the police

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:59.495
after using a men's bathroom
at the local train station.

00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:06.320
By that time, she had abandoned
her birth name, Anna Pauline,

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.960
and was going by
the nickname, Paul.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.780
Although, soon thereafter,
she chose the more gender

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:18.080
ambiguous Pauli and stuck with
it for the rest of her life.

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.600
In the years that
followed, Murray

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.600
found support for her
sense of inner maleness

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:27.920
in the work of early 20th
century sexologists, chief

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:32.420
among them, Havelock
Ellis, who argued that sex

00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:35.080
existed on a continuum.

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:39.170
Everyone is partly
male and partly female.

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:43.250
As an extreme example,
Ellis offered the idea

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:45.770
of the pseudohermaphrodite--

00:31:45.770 --> 00:31:48.650
a person with internal
organs associated

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:52.040
with one gender and
external characteristics

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:54.170
associated with another.

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:55.430
Bingo.

00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:58.940
Murray felt that she had
found her self-definition

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:01.700
as a pseudohermaphrodite.

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:05.960
Murray also found encouragement
in the work of endocrinologists

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:12.140
in the 1930s, in her 20s,
who pointed to sex hormones

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:14.810
as the critical
element in determining

00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:18.800
whether a fetus develops
into a boy or a girl.

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:22.160
Some scientists also
reported that hormones

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:25.750
could help effeminate boys
become more masculine.

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:27.620
And Murray reasoned
that if hormones

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:30.290
could help effeminate boys to
be more manly, that they could

00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:31.620
do the same thing for her.

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:35.030
And so for 20 years,
Murray begged doctors

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:37.220
to give her testosterone.

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:38.540
They refused.

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:42.140
She requested an
x-ray of her abdomen

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:47.090
in order to prove that she
had internal male sex organs.

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:49.340
The x-rays showed nothing.

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:52.580
She underwent
exploratory surgery

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:55.890
for persistent abdominal pain.

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:58.730
The surgeon found an inflamed
appendix and fallopian

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:00.890
tube, but not the
testes that Murray

00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:03.740
had hoped he would discover.

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:07.250
Not able to persuade anyone
that her true self was male,

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:10.670
Murray suffered repeated
emotional breakdowns.

00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:13.340
She spent time in
psychiatric hospitals.

00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:15.560
One doctor gave
her a diagnosis--

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.080
schizophrenia--
based on his finding

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:22.700
that she was under the
delusion that she was a man.

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:27.800
Now these personal defeats would
have destroyed most people.

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.920
But they didn't destroy Murray.

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:34.250
She was an extremely
resilient person.

00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:38.240
But I think that her family
reinforced this lifesaving

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:39.320
quality.

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:42.710
She learned early on that she
was part of a long Civil Rights

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:46.560
Movement that stretched all
the way back to Sojourner Truth

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:51.240
and forward to W.E.B Du Bois,
whose magazine, The Crisis,

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:55.080
appeared at the family home
in Durham, in which she

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:59.340
read from childhood.

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:03.060
The pride that Murray drew
from this past helped turn

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:06.330
a crushing experience-- the
medical dismissal of her gender

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:07.470
dysphoria--

00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:11.429
into part of a larger
campaign for human rights.

00:34:11.429 --> 00:34:14.090
Now the historian's
secret weapon,

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:18.449
I was told in graduate
school, is chronology.

00:34:18.449 --> 00:34:21.090
This is not, today,
as popular as it was

00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:22.380
when I was in graduate school.

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:26.110
But I've always taken
it very seriously.

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:29.159
And as I created a
timeline of Murray's life,

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:33.480
I could see that Murray's most
important insights corresponded

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:37.350
to periods of most
intense personal struggle.

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:41.360
As an example-- and Brittney
and I did not coordinate this--

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.699
Let's take the years
1941 to 1944 when

00:34:44.699 --> 00:34:47.460
she was at Howard Law School.

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.620
She was in her early '30s.

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:51.960
These were the years,
starting at Howard,

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:55.179
in which she developed the idea
of Jane Crow, as Brittney has

00:34:55.179 --> 00:35:00.090
said, to convey the compounding
effect of race and gender

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:01.470
oppression.

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:03.510
The only woman in
her class, Murray

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:06.630
could not understand
why male classmates, who

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:09.930
had come to Howard to
equip themselves to fight

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:12.720
against race
discrimination, routinely

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:15.780
discriminated against
her because she

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:18.810
appeared to be a woman.

00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:20.490
One of the most
important lessons

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:23.310
that Murray drew from
her legal education

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:26.220
was the power of analogy.

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:28.350
In college at Hunter
College in New York,

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:31.140
she'd learned from a
class in anthropology

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:34.950
that race was not a
biological fact but an idea.

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:43.050
In law school, Murray came
to see sex as an analogous

00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:44.670
condition to race--

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:48.450
not a biological fact,
but an idea, and not

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:50.540
a particularly good one.

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:55.461
For as with the concept
of race, so was sex.

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.880
Sex and race both
were categories

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:07.890
that were artificial, arbitrary,
without clear boundaries.

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:11.100
Murray inwardly male,
outwardly female-ish

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:14.850
was living proof of that.

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:16.770
When Murray
graduated from Howard

00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:20.910
first in the class in 1944,
she applied for graduate study

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:23.810
at Harvard University.

00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:26.910
Valedictorians from
Howard Law School

00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:30.840
routinely came here to
Harvard for an advanced degree

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:34.410
to prepare them to
teach in law schools,

00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:37.350
to be professors in law schools.

00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:40.410
Harvard rejected Pauli
Murray because of her gender.

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:43.320
She responded with an appeal
to the law Harvard Law School

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.250
faculty.

00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:47.580
And at the same
time, a new doctor--

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:49.260
she kept getting new doctors.

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:52.830
The same time that a new doctor
was withholding testosterone,

00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:54.870
this is what she wrote.

00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:59.190
"Gentlemen, I would
gladly change my sex

00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:00.860
to meet your requirements.

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:04.800
But since the way to such change
has not been revealed to me,

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.920
I have no recourse but to
appeal to you to change

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:10.620
your minds on this subject.

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:15.630
Are you to tell me that one
is as difficult as the other?

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:17.130
Apparently so."

00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:19.260
Harvard would not have her.

00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:22.290
Murray responded to
this defeat by writing

00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:26.070
a series of papers over
the next several months

00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:27.750
in which she laid
out an argument that

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:31.440
would guide her work over
the next two decades.

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:35.430
Her argument was that both the
13th and the 14th Amendments

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:39.900
barred any arbitrary
classification by color.

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:42.960
By analogy, she proposed
that the same reasoning

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.090
held for sex.

00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:48.720
In the years that followed,
Murray gave up on the idea

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:51.300
that she had hidden
male sex organs.

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:54.510
She could not ignore the x-ray
and the surgical evidence

00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:56.440
that they did not exist.

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.170
But she never
abandoned her sense

00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:02.310
of inner maleness centered
in her male brain.

00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:04.950
She deployed that feeling
throughout the rest of her life

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:08.700
to attack the laws, customs,
and practices that discriminated

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:12.810
first, on the basis of race;
second, on the basis of gender;

00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:17.190
and finally, on the basis of
what she came to call status

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:22.320
as a "social minority", which
was as close as she was ever

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:25.930
to able to bring
herself in her lifetime

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:29.820
to meaning gay, lesbian,
bisexual, transgender,

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:31.860
or disabled.

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:35.150
Rarely has so much
personal frustration

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:37.920
been channeled into such
transformative public

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:39.180
achievement.

00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:42.120
Murray's frustration led her
to pressure Thurgood Marshall

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:46.170
to attack segregation head-on
and to inspire Ruth Bader

00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:48.330
Ginsburg to argue that
the Equal Protection

00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:51.960
Clause of the 14th Amendment
should be understand to protect

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:55.020
not only against
discrimination based on race,

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:57.900
but also discrimination
based on gender.

00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:01.340
Murray's work was a gift
that has kept on giving.

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:04.463
We are all the beneficiaries
of her courage.

00:39:04.463 --> 00:39:05.409
- Thank you.

00:39:05.409 --> 00:39:08.720
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:14.816
- So Ken, from your
own discussion--

00:39:14.816 --> 00:39:15.940
and it's a rich discussion.

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:18.490
I've used your book in
my African-American Lives

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:19.780
and the Law class.

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:27.070
In your discussion, you see
and you see through this panel,

00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:30.820
there are so many different
perspectives on Murray.

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:38.050
And it does lead one to believe
that her life appeals not only

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:43.030
to all that was going on in
her past, but to us today.

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:44.260
It's so relevant.

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:47.830
These issues that we seem
to be talking about today

00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:51.640
were issues that were
so germane to her.

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:57.580
And so, it made me wonder if
it isn't unreasonable to think

00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:02.200
that it would take just a
whole diversity of skills

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.940
to even write about this woman.

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:08.290
Now, do you think
I'm exaggerating?

00:40:08.290 --> 00:40:09.610
- No.

00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:11.530
No I don't.

00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:18.585
So to illustrate, I think
you speak exactly right.

00:40:18.585 --> 00:40:22.510
And to illustrate, let
me just use some words.

00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:25.450
How would we describe
Pauli Murray?

00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:28.300
Well, we often describe
people by what they do.

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:30.110
So what did she do?

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:34.390
She was a writer, a poet, a
social activist, a civil rights

00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:36.760
lawyer, a practicing lawyer--

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:39.380
which is different than
a civil rights lawyer.

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:42.850
She worked at Paul
Weiss, a white-shoe law

00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:45.160
firm in New York-- one of
the first African-Americans

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:49.090
to ever work at such a
law firm in the 1950s.

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:50.600
She's a professor.

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.770
She's a feminist theorist.

00:40:52.770 --> 00:40:55.900
And she was an Episcopal priest.

00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:59.804
We might also ask, how
would we describe her

00:40:59.804 --> 00:41:00.845
in terms of her identity?

00:41:00.845 --> 00:41:03.880
Well, with a whole bunch of
other words that come to mind--

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:07.840
black woman, southerner,
mixed-race person,

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:10.120
black, middle-class person.

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.730
Her upbringing in
Durham was always

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:16.960
key to understanding how
she became who she was.

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:21.520
A gender non-conforming person;
our current word is queer.

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:23.320
She was a black American.

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:26.970
She went to Ghana and discovered
that Kwame Nkrumah's brand

00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:29.200
of Pan-Africanism
was not for her.

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:32.260
She felt like a black American.

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:37.460
And human-- her final term
for all this stuff she came up

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:37.960
with--

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:39.270
I shouldn't say final.

00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:41.740
There's never a final
for Pauli Murray.

00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:43.990
But she came up with this
term of human rights instead

00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:45.620
of civil rights.

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:49.625
So these are all words that
we can use to describe her.

00:41:49.625 --> 00:41:51.250
But we also have to
remember that these

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:55.240
are, in fact, our words
that we use in the present

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:58.510
to describe her.

00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:02.170
Because in fact, none of these
terms really capture her.

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:04.120
Because she was a person
for whom boundaries

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:07.000
between these kinds of
things didn't really matter,

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:12.212
or the boundaries were the
problem, not the solution.

00:42:12.212 --> 00:42:13.920
So I came to a conclusion
my own research

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:16.480
that it was the
problem of boundaries

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:18.685
that led to her most
important personal struggles

00:42:18.685 --> 00:42:21.220
and to her most
important contributions

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:23.330
to the larger world.

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:29.950
So yeah, it's really,
really hard to describe her.

00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:32.370
And that's the challenge.

00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:35.010
Now, I first encountered
her-- it was probably 1994.

00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:39.550
It was my first of graduate
school at Princeton.

00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:43.690
There was this book by
someone named Evelyn Brooks

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:47.500
Higginbotham either about to
come out or had just come out.

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:49.120
I can't remember.

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:52.300
I was in the basement
of Firestone Library.

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:57.370
And I was looking at all
these books on black lawyers.

00:42:57.370 --> 00:43:01.210
And there was a book called
Song in a Weary Throat

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:03.640
by somebody named Pauli
Murray, who I'd never heard of.

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:08.380
You could see
immediately that there

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:11.060
was something different
about her just in the book.

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:12.160
And then the book--

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:15.430
as Professor Bell-Scott
and Professor Rosenberg,

00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:20.100
and I'm sure Professor Cooper--
will just tell the public

00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:24.310
she hid all these things
in her autobiography.

00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:25.810
But you could still see them.

00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:28.040
She had short hair.

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.110
She was really thin.

00:43:29.110 --> 00:43:33.550
And she had this way of
looking, and she seemed

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:36.760
to be looking directly at you.

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:40.190
But my agenda was elsewhere.

00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:42.640
So I knew she was interesting.

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.530
I read her autobiography.

00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:48.250
But I went on to write about
black lawyers and black women

00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:50.770
lawyers.

00:43:50.770 --> 00:43:52.870
I didn't have access to
an archive at that time

00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:54.910
about Pauli Murray.

00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:57.370
And I wound up writing a lot
about the prior generation

00:43:57.370 --> 00:44:00.850
of black women lawyers
before Pauli Murray

00:44:00.850 --> 00:44:03.460
and in particular, about
a woman in Philadelphia--

00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:06.730
a black woman lawyer
named Sadie Alexander.

00:44:06.730 --> 00:44:10.120
And I was trying to figure
out an old question, which

00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:14.690
is, what does it mean to say
that the legal profession is

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:18.560
a masculine profession, as
historian Michael Grossberg has

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:21.301
argued in a classic essay.

00:44:21.301 --> 00:44:23.300
And I was writing this
book called, Representing

00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:25.940
the Race, which was
really about what it meant

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:27.590
to be a lawyer of
American society

00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:30.308
and what it meant to be
a racial representative.

00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:39.620
And I probably would never
have written about Pauli Murray

00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:44.000
except for this coincidence that
I have this job at Harvard Law

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.130
School, and the
Schlesinger Library

00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:49.160
was right across the street.

00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:53.142
So I was writing
about black lawyers.

00:44:53.142 --> 00:44:55.600
And you've got this archive
that's right across the street.

00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:58.220
So you've got to go.

00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:00.810
That was the easy part.

00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:04.760
The hard part was what I found
when I went through her papers.

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:09.140
I found all these
things that she did.

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:11.600
And also, I found
all these things

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:17.615
that she was, I was just
going to make her story--

00:45:17.615 --> 00:45:20.720
I wound up writing a chapter
about her in my book.

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:23.030
But I was just going
to write 10 pages.

00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:27.110
I needed to end the story
about these black women lawyers

00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:29.180
of the previous generation.

00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:33.110
And Pauli Murray seemed to be
this nice transition point.

00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:35.300
It seemed like it
was generational.

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:39.350
10 pages on Pauli
Murray, and I'd be done.

00:45:39.350 --> 00:45:43.340
Well, whoever can do that--

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:45.960
soon I had 50 pages
on Pauli Murray.

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:47.240
You could write a book.

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:49.670
You could write a series of
books and still not be done.

00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:53.810
So I had to stop at my 50
pages and condense them down

00:45:53.810 --> 00:45:56.840
and decide that I was done.

00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:00.410
And I also decided that
I wasn't quite satisfied

00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:02.720
with what other
people said about her

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:05.890
up until that time,
which was before actually

00:46:05.890 --> 00:46:08.510
Professor Rosenberg and
Professor Bell-Scott's books

00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:09.380
had come out.

00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:11.360
A lot of the early
writing about her really

00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:13.740
trying to reduce her to a type.

00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:18.620
She was either a
Cold War conformist,

00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:20.680
some people said she
was a prophetic voice

00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:22.942
to the workplace
discrimination movement.

00:46:22.942 --> 00:46:24.650
Some people said she
was a representative

00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:27.710
of this Depression-era
Southern Left.

00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:29.480
Some people said
she was an advocate

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:31.950
of democratic theology.

00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:34.070
[INAUDIBLE] event or a
sex discrimination law,

00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:36.710
or even a precursor
to the transgendered.

00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:39.620
And something seemed wrong about
that way of thinking about her.

00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:43.530
So I picked one particular
thing to write about.

00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:46.270
What do you write
about with this person

00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:50.150
who is so complicated, it's
very hard to write about her?

00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:52.100
So I came up with this idea.

00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:53.870
I just decided I'd
try to figure out

00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:55.640
how she came up with Jane Crow.

00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:59.640
And again, the
years 1941 to 1944

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:03.050
were really large in this story.

00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:06.800
So I had to decide.

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:09.170
I decided that what
was most important

00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:13.499
was her struggle
against boundaries.

00:47:13.499 --> 00:47:15.540
And then I wrote this
chapter about Pauli Murray.

00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:16.859
And then the book came out.

00:47:16.859 --> 00:47:19.400
And people kept telling me that
it was their favorite chapter

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:20.770
in the book.

00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:22.520
It really wasn't
supposed to be a chapter.

00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:25.100
It was supposed to be 10 pages.

00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:27.360
David Garrow reviewed it
in the Washington Post.

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:29.065
The loved the Pauli
Murray chapter.

00:47:29.065 --> 00:47:29.690
You know David.

00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:31.630
He's a critical guy.

00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:33.770
But he at least
liked that thing.

00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:36.980
And I'd like to think
that some of that

00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:38.250
was due to my own efforts.

00:47:38.250 --> 00:47:42.590
But I think it was due to the
richness of Pauli Murray's

00:47:42.590 --> 00:47:43.940
story.

00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:46.040
And if you try to grapple
with that richness,

00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:49.419
you've got a great story,
no matter how you write it.

00:47:49.419 --> 00:47:51.710
So to return to this question
about needing a diversity

00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:52.970
of skills to capture her life.

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:55.040
Yes, absolutely.

00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:56.570
That's the key.

00:47:56.570 --> 00:47:58.310
I think hers is the
life that exists

00:47:58.310 --> 00:48:00.290
beyond all the boundaries.

00:48:00.290 --> 00:48:02.010
We're academics.

00:48:02.010 --> 00:48:04.580
To be an academic is
to be a specialist.

00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:07.310
You know your set of things.

00:48:07.310 --> 00:48:11.720
But the problem is, she's
beyond all the sets of things

00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:13.340
that we know.

00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:15.440
So just to give two examples--

00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:19.520
her signature poem is this
poem called, "Dark Testament."

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:22.120
She wrote poetry-- a lot of it.

00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:26.040
And it was really important
to understanding who she was.

00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:27.975
I'm not a literary scholar.

00:48:30.530 --> 00:48:34.310
Or her deep-seated
Christian faith.

00:48:34.310 --> 00:48:37.220
She was, at various times,
a Christian socialist.

00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:39.830
She was devoted to the Episcopal
church for her entire life.

00:48:39.830 --> 00:48:41.810
She became a priest
at a time where

00:48:41.810 --> 00:48:45.500
she was never sure she was
even going to be ordained.

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:47.900
How does one assemble
the set of skills

00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:50.510
to write about all this stuff?

00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:56.180
Well I just got to give props to
Professor Bell-Scott, Professor

00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:58.437
Rosenberg, and Professor
Cooper for taking

00:48:58.437 --> 00:49:00.395
this on because I think
it was too intimidating

00:49:00.395 --> 00:49:03.710
a task for me to try to take
over as a book length project.

00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:07.150
So I just did a
chapter about her.

00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:08.720
And what I decided
I'd write about

00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:11.850
was law-- about her legal
theory of Jane Crow.

00:49:11.850 --> 00:49:14.400
And even that
required me to arrange

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:17.280
through topics
that I didn't know

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:19.245
a lot about, like the
history of sexuality,

00:49:19.245 --> 00:49:22.081
the history of leftist
activism, the history

00:49:22.081 --> 00:49:23.580
of the black middle
class in Durham,

00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:27.330
and so on, and so on, and so on.

00:49:27.330 --> 00:49:29.850
So I think I'm right about
my conclusions in my chapter.

00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:32.670
And I tried to write a
lot about law because that

00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:33.960
was a thing I knew about.

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:36.810
And I wrote a lot
about Howard Law School

00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:40.840
because that was a thing
I knew a whole lot about.

00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:45.660
And I wrote a lot about her
early life of the 1930s.

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:48.996
But I'd say that even that was
a daunting project to take on.

00:49:48.996 --> 00:49:50.370
And the others on
this panel have

00:49:50.370 --> 00:49:52.620
taken on even more
daunting projects

00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:54.840
and executed them beautifully.

00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:58.710
And the answer to
your question is yes.

00:49:58.710 --> 00:50:03.030
It's impossible to
really capture her story.

00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:05.610
And there's so much
more work to be done.

00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:06.180
- Thank you.

00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:08.994
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:11.808 --> 00:50:15.020
- So now I'd like to ask you--

00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:18.110
and just follow one
behind the other.

00:50:18.110 --> 00:50:23.240
When you think about your
work with Pauli Murray, what

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:28.100
was it that was most
memorable, or most striking,

00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:31.700
or something that
just got to you?

00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:33.690
I'd like to know what
that experience was.

00:50:37.350 --> 00:50:40.950
- What fascinates me
most, and stays with me,

00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:47.070
and gives me energy,
and still puzzles me,

00:50:47.070 --> 00:50:49.720
and keeps me going--

00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:51.660
I feel like I'm not
done with Pauli.

00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:57.960
And it is this particular issue
that I'm still feeding off of,

00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:02.880
is the use of writing,
particularly personal writing,

00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:09.090
as a vehicle for
coming to know herself,

00:51:09.090 --> 00:51:15.440
as a way of dealing with
most issues of conflict,

00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:17.730
as self-affirmation.

00:51:17.730 --> 00:51:21.000
Just in general, the
role of writing, and it's

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.610
really important to
me because I think

00:51:23.610 --> 00:51:28.830
in this particular moment,
where much of the attention

00:51:28.830 --> 00:51:34.680
she is getting by
institutions, your alma mater

00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:36.780
will give her an
honorary doctorate--

00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:39.090
it should have done this
a long time ago-- in May,

00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:40.220
at graduation.

00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:43.250
- Wonderful I might have
to go to graduation.

00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:46.470
- Yeah, you might have
to go to graduation.

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:49.185
Much of that is
about her activisim,

00:51:49.185 --> 00:51:53.670
about her legal work, and the
piece I feel is getting lost,

00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:58.560
in terms of contributions,
is her writing.

00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:04.320
I think Proud Shoes is one
of the earliest and most

00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:09.000
important examples of what we
now call literary nonfiction.

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.420
It is a model for
contemporary memoirs

00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:14.880
when I look at what my
colleagues in creative writing

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:19.350
programs are trying
to teach people to do.

00:52:19.350 --> 00:52:21.060
Her poetry is out of print.

00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:26.460
But I hear that that
collection may see light again.

00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:31.230
So I am very interested in
how important writing was

00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:35.340
to her health, to her advocacy.

00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:37.875
And I wanted to
share two examples.

00:52:41.290 --> 00:52:44.100
One example is from
a letter that's

00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:46.560
frequently quoted as of late.

00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:48.990
It's written during
the-- here we

00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:51.780
go to that period
of 1941 to 1944,

00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:53.650
when she's working
through a lot of issues.

00:52:53.650 --> 00:52:59.350
She has just come from
being hospitalized.

00:52:59.350 --> 00:53:06.060
And this is after she has really
been ostracized and treated

00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:10.030
very badly by her
peers and the faculty.

00:53:10.030 --> 00:53:12.510
And it has to do with
her crush on a sophomore.

00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:15.790
And she is just distraught
because this is a relationship

00:53:15.790 --> 00:53:17.370
that is not going to work.

00:53:17.370 --> 00:53:19.380
And I'm just going to
read just brief excerpts.

00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:22.960
And I think what you'll see
is her working through things

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:26.057
but also her writing as
a form of resistance.

00:53:26.057 --> 00:53:28.140
This is one of the things
she says in this letter.

00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:30.480
It's a letter to
her Aunt Pauline.

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:32.490
"This little
boy-girl personality,

00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:35.700
as you jokingly call
it, Aunt Pauline,

00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:38.010
sometimes gets me into trouble.

00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:39.900
And I'm no further
along to adjustment

00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:43.530
than I was in the summer of
1935, when I was at home."

00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:46.080
She regularly keeps
notes when she's

00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:49.650
in hospitals of what she's
feeling, what she's thinking,

00:53:49.650 --> 00:53:51.850
what she's saying to doctors.

00:53:51.850 --> 00:53:53.070
And this is what she writes.

00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:55.920
"I got caught between
certain medical rivalries.

00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:58.110
And the particular
doctor threatened

00:53:58.110 --> 00:54:00.450
to have me sent to
Gallagher Hospital

00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:02.340
for mental observations.

00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:04.710
And I, of course,
might have been put out

00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:08.040
of commission for a long time
on the basis of family history

00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:11.010
alone if that had
been carried out."

00:54:11.010 --> 00:54:13.961
She doesn't write about her
family history of mental health

00:54:13.961 --> 00:54:14.460
problems.

00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:16.260
There's a history in the family.

00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:19.920
And that's not in
the autobiography.

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:22.710
And then she also
says, "I have done

00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:26.280
nothing of which to be
ashamed of outside the rules

00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:27.060
of society.

00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:30.510
And yet if it had not been
for people like Dr. Ransom--

00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:31.800
these are her mentors--

00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:34.470
my whole career for
two years at Howard

00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:37.110
would have gone up in smoke."

00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:39.080
"Mother, you've been
so understanding,

00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:40.470
both you and Aunt Sally.

00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:42.480
But where you and a
few people understand,

00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:46.350
the world does not understand
or accept my pattern of life.

00:54:46.350 --> 00:54:49.560
And to try to live by
society's standards always

00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:52.820
causes me such inner
conflict that at times, it's

00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:54.450
almost unbearable.

00:54:54.450 --> 00:54:57.360
I don't know whether I'm
right or whether society

00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:59.790
or some medical
authority is right.

00:54:59.790 --> 00:55:03.630
I only know how I feel
and what makes me happy.

00:55:03.630 --> 00:55:06.780
This conflict rises up to
kick me down at every apex

00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:11.040
I reach in my career, and
because the laws of society

00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:15.810
do not protect me, I am exposed
to any person or enemy who may

00:55:15.810 --> 00:55:18.030
or may not want to hurt me."

00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:24.360
So very clarifying ideas of
where the boundaries are,

00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:27.530
who's for her, who's against
her, what's fair, what's not--

00:55:27.530 --> 00:55:32.850
but clear about what she needs
and where she would like to go.

00:55:32.850 --> 00:55:37.290
And another example
I'd like to share

00:55:37.290 --> 00:55:42.180
comes from a period
when she's really

00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:46.400
upset about not being able to
go to the University of North

00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:46.910
Carolina.

00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:51.080
They rejected her on
racial grounds in 1939.

00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:53.180
And she was [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:55.160
She really thought
that she might

00:55:55.160 --> 00:56:00.770
be able to be admitted because
of a recent court ruling.

00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:03.920
And it involved a young
man, Lloyd Gaines,

00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:07.400
who the court said
deserved to be

00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:11.420
admitted to the University
of Missouri Law School.

00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:14.070
But before he could
enroll, he disappeared.

00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:15.660
And he was never found again.

00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:19.220
He was believed to
be murdered or--

00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:22.250
so Pauli was just outraged.

00:56:22.250 --> 00:56:26.570
And I share this because
this is one sentence, which

00:56:26.570 --> 00:56:31.520
shows you the energy that comes
to her in moments like this.

00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:36.950
And this is what she's writing
because there's been a prize

00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:38.810
fight in the black community.

00:56:38.810 --> 00:56:40.880
People were really
excited about this.

00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:43.130
And the title of
this hot article

00:56:43.130 --> 00:56:46.190
is called, "Who is to Blame
for the Disappearance of Lloyd

00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:46.910
Gaines?"

00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:49.070
This is the final paragraph.

00:56:49.070 --> 00:56:53.060
She writes, "We Negroes can
throng the streets 300,000

00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:56.900
strong, break bottles over
resisting heads, stop traffic,

00:56:56.900 --> 00:56:59.780
commandeer buses and
other public vehicles,

00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:02.480
and show unprecedented
aggressiveness, joy,

00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:05.930
and hilarity when a Joe Lewis
knocks out a single white

00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:08.930
opponent by appointment,
but when a Lloyd Gaines

00:57:08.930 --> 00:57:12.500
single-handedly comes up against
the whole region of the country

00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:15.740
with its hidebound folkways
of white supremacy,

00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:18.740
with its lynching parties, and
with the great majority of its

00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:22.340
population disenfranchised
and disinherited--

00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:24.470
when he battles his way
to the Supreme Court

00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:26.960
and back again
facing the insults,

00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:30.230
the butts of criticism, the
uncertainties, the threats,

00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:34.190
the inner great struggle between
idealism and personal safety--

00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:37.280
when he does all this
alone with scarcely more

00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:39.920
than his own conscience
and a few loyal friends

00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:45.290
to reassure him, not a
single mass demonstration

00:57:45.290 --> 00:57:50.630
is held anywhere in the country,
in spite of this biting call."

00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:53.570
She concludes this by
saying, "Find Lloyd Gaines

00:57:53.570 --> 00:57:55.730
if he can be found.

00:57:55.730 --> 00:58:00.080
If not, finish the job
he left uncompleted."

00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:02.230
One sentence is all that.

00:58:02.230 --> 00:58:03.760
That's how much she cared.

00:58:06.570 --> 00:58:10.680
- So a couple of
things really strike me

00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:14.180
and that stick with
me about Pauli Murray.

00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:16.880
Because I care a lot about black
women's intellectual history

00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:21.320
I'm just struck by the breadth
of how many intellectual

00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:23.660
interventions she is
at the forefront of--

00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:26.420
whether we're talking about
feminist theory, critical race

00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:28.280
theory.

00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:30.950
Her thesis in Divinity
School was a comparison

00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:34.130
between black liberation
theology and feminist theology.

00:58:34.130 --> 00:58:35.900
So that's the precursor
to what we come

00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:37.880
to know as womanist theology.

00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:41.950
You actually can't start it if
you don't look at her thesis.

00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:44.540
And so she really
invents and helps

00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:48.890
to create a context for many
of the major intellectual

00:58:48.890 --> 00:58:50.930
interventions that come
out of black studies

00:58:50.930 --> 00:58:54.416
and feminist thought in
the 20th and 21st century.

00:58:54.416 --> 00:58:55.790
And I hope that
she will continue

00:58:55.790 --> 00:58:57.530
to get credit for that.

00:58:57.530 --> 00:59:04.790
On a more narrow note,
in 1969, Dr. Murray

00:59:04.790 --> 00:59:07.160
is a professor of American
Studies at Brandeis.

00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:10.310
And it's happening
at the same time

00:59:10.310 --> 00:59:12.140
that black students
take over the campus.

00:59:12.140 --> 00:59:15.690
They are demanding the
founding of black studies.

00:59:15.690 --> 00:59:17.390
And so she's brought in.

00:59:17.390 --> 00:59:19.760
She works on the
administration there.

00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:22.970
And want her to help keep
these black students in line.

00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:25.784
It's in line with
institutional practices today.

00:59:25.784 --> 00:59:26.700
Black students act up.

00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:30.840
And then folks say, who can we
bring to help them feel better?

00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:36.500
But Murray was
conflicted because she

00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:39.814
was very ambivalent about
this new turn to Blackness.

00:59:39.814 --> 00:59:41.480
By this point in her
life she had really

00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:44.480
embraced a multiracial
perspective of herself.

00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:49.430
She preferred to be called
Negro with a capital N.

00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:55.160
And she said that quote,
"The rhetoric of Black Power"

00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:58.370
quote "grated upon
her sensibilities"

00:59:58.370 --> 01:00:00.950
because she felt that she was
quote "living in a world turned

01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:04.340
upside down with a complete
reversal of the goals

01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:07.040
that had fired her
own student activism."

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:09.770
So she saw the Black Power
Movement, who she derisively

01:00:09.770 --> 01:00:12.310
called The Apostles
of Black Consciousness

01:00:12.310 --> 01:00:15.440
as deeply masculinist
and patriarchal, which

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:17.290
is a fair critique.

01:00:17.290 --> 01:00:20.090
But because of that, it
made her particularly

01:00:20.090 --> 01:00:24.440
resistant to the all-consuming
power of Blackness.

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:26.750
And at that same moment,
she loves these students.

01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:28.370
And she's deeply
committed to them.

01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:30.245
Patricia Hill Collins
is one of her students,

01:00:30.245 --> 01:00:33.890
who she talks about briefly in
a line of her autobiography.

01:00:33.890 --> 01:00:37.130
And she says, I had this
wonderful senior student who

01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:39.980
walks out of the class yelling,
"black solidarity" one day,

01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:40.996
"Black power".

01:00:40.996 --> 01:00:42.370
And it was Patricia
Hill Collins.

01:00:42.370 --> 01:00:43.670
And I emailed Dr. Collins.

01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:44.746
I said, was this you?

01:00:44.746 --> 01:00:45.650
And she said yes.

01:00:45.650 --> 01:00:48.240
This was my professor.

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:50.945
And so there's also these
different genealogies

01:00:50.945 --> 01:00:52.390
of black feminist thought.

01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:54.140
But the thing that I
wonder in this moment

01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:58.130
of the movement for Black
Lives, is how Dr. Murray

01:00:58.130 --> 01:00:59.300
might think about it.

01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:05.540
Because I think she would be
deeply resistant to the embrace

01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:07.851
of the primacy of
Blackness and this analysis

01:01:07.851 --> 01:01:08.600
of anti-Blackness.

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:11.310
And I think it would make
her very uncomfortable.

01:01:11.310 --> 01:01:12.980
But I think the
challenge for her

01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:15.170
would be that it is the
movement for Black Lives

01:01:15.170 --> 01:01:19.610
that has been at the forefront
of saying that we will center.

01:01:19.610 --> 01:01:23.690
And we will prioritize black
gender nonconforming and trans

01:01:23.690 --> 01:01:24.410
people--

01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:26.120
that their lives
matter, that they have

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.190
to be a political priority.

01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:33.830
And so I think her resistance
to the analytic of Blackness

01:01:33.830 --> 01:01:37.160
was because she saw
it as bespeaking

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:40.610
particular analogical
limitations on gender.

01:01:40.610 --> 01:01:43.250
So the moves that she could
make around gender and sexuality

01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:47.000
in her lifetime, her history
allowed her to make those moves

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.260
in terms of race.

01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:51.890
So she couldn't be a sexual
person the way that she wanted.

01:01:51.890 --> 01:01:54.500
But she could be multiracial
because it was her background.

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:56.480
And so I think that
she saw Blackness

01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:59.210
as really limiting and
putting her in another box.

01:01:59.210 --> 01:02:02.120
And yet in this moment, the
fervor around young people

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:06.440
of color's ability to be gender
nonconforming unapologetically

01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:08.930
and to say that that is
a part of black politics,

01:02:08.930 --> 01:02:13.309
has happened on the backs of
a new Black Power Movement.

01:02:13.309 --> 01:02:15.350
So I think it would create
real conflict for her.

01:02:15.350 --> 01:02:17.100
And I'm just reminded,
then, of a question

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:21.410
that she asked I found in
the archives when I was here.

01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:23.900
She wrote this piece
in 1942 called,

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:25.520
"Negro Youth's Dilemma."

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:27.560
And it was about all
of the angst and anger

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:30.680
of her generation
around World War II.

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:33.920
But in 1969, she
pulled out a copy

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:35.420
of "Negro Youth's Dilemma."

01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:37.010
And she just scribbled
on the bottom

01:02:37.010 --> 01:02:40.070
of it, "Postscript 1969--

01:02:40.070 --> 01:02:42.950
Another war, another
generation of angry youth.

01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:45.480
How do slash shall
we answer them?"

01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:55.850
- I never experienced
an epiphany.

01:02:55.850 --> 01:03:00.650
It was more a slow dawning.

01:03:00.650 --> 01:03:03.710
Eleanor Roosevelt paved
the way by giving me

01:03:03.710 --> 01:03:06.650
my first big break as a writer.

01:03:06.650 --> 01:03:11.240
I interviewed her in 1960
when I was 14 years old.

01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:14.990
She was spending the
winter at the Arizona Inn.

01:03:14.990 --> 01:03:17.480
We talked about
the Soviet Union,

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:20.600
the value of learning
Russian, and the importance

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:24.170
of getting to know people
different from ourselves.

01:03:24.170 --> 01:03:26.940
I published the story in my
Tucson high school newspaper.

01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:28.715
It was my very first story.

01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:33.560
Ruth Bader Ginsburg
continued my education.

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:38.240
When I reached Columbia as an
assistant professor in 1974,

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:42.110
Columbia Law School's first
tenured female professor,

01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:46.940
Ruth Bader Ginsburg, made me
aware of Pauli Murray, whose

01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:50.210
name she had
included with her own

01:03:50.210 --> 01:03:55.790
on her first brief in the case
called Reed v. Reed, which

01:03:55.790 --> 01:03:59.300
the Supreme Court
recognized gender

01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:02.420
as an arbitrary classification.

01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:04.820
But at the time, I
didn't fully understand

01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:08.720
how pivotal Murray was.

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:11.370
Not until I read
Murray's autobiography,

01:04:11.370 --> 01:04:15.320
Song in a Weary Throat,
in 1987 that I finally

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:17.990
appreciate Murray's
pioneering role

01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:20.900
in civil rights,
modern feminism,

01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:24.620
and in the shaping of
modern jurisprudence.

01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:28.970
I included her as a transitional
figure in my history of women

01:04:28.970 --> 01:04:32.170
in the 20th century, which
I called Divided Lives.

01:04:32.170 --> 01:04:34.850
Pauli Murray linked Eleanor
Roosevelt and Ruth Bader

01:04:34.850 --> 01:04:36.660
Ginsburg.

01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:39.650
But it was only
in the mid 1990s,

01:04:39.650 --> 01:04:43.280
after the Schlesinger
Library made Murray's papers

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:47.690
available to researchers, that
Murray's importance finally

01:04:47.690 --> 01:04:49.850
dawned on me.

01:04:49.850 --> 01:04:53.360
I was struck, especially, by her
long-term struggle over gender

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:56.510
identity, as I've said,
and its connection

01:04:56.510 --> 01:05:00.920
to her campaign against
what she called, Jane Crow.

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:05.020
As many researchers
have found, box 4

01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:08.150
was particularly striking.

01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:11.240
Reading Pauli Murray's
notes to her herself--

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:13.130
and as a parenthetical,
one reason

01:05:13.130 --> 01:05:15.650
I became a 20th
century historian

01:05:15.650 --> 01:05:17.960
was because I had
so much difficulty

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:19.320
with people's handwriting.

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:22.630
In the 20th century, people
start using the typewriter.

01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:25.250
Pauli Murray had the
typewriter with her

01:05:25.250 --> 01:05:29.720
in the hospitals she either
voluntarily entered or was

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:31.280
consigned to.

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:33.380
These notes are typewritten--

01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:36.440
not the letter to Aunt
Pauline but the letters

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:39.220
from the hospitals.

01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:42.065
And they were
incredibly powerful.

01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:48.750
The clarity of her conviction
that she was inwardly male--

01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:51.590
a pseudohermaphrodite,
as she said;

01:05:51.590 --> 01:05:55.400
how hard she fought with doctors
to help her change her outward

01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:58.280
appearance to align
with her inner self--

01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:01.130
how poignant to read
about that at a time

01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:05.240
when there was no social
movement to support her.

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:11.180
That was very,
very moving to me.

01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:16.250
These notes end in the 1950s.

01:06:16.250 --> 01:06:17.990
By then, she'd
given up on the idea

01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:20.180
that she was a
pseudohermaphrodite.

01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:22.220
But later letters
and diary entries

01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:24.890
made clear that she never
abandoned her belief

01:06:24.890 --> 01:06:30.290
in her maleness, especially
in her years as a priest.

01:06:30.290 --> 01:06:34.730
She came to think
of God as having

01:06:34.730 --> 01:06:37.940
made her a person in between--

01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:41.510
male on the inside,
female on the outside--

01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:44.660
to serve as a bridge,
to help others

01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:47.570
overcome the socially
imposed divisions

01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:52.880
of male and female, black
and white, North and South,

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:54.710
rich and poor.

01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:58.040
That goal of hers
of reconciliation

01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:00.380
that she pursued
in the priesthood

01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:02.720
was what I found
most moving and what

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:04.340
made me want to tell her story.

01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:14.830
- Well, what really struck
me about researching

01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:19.955
Pauli Murray was I think,
basically, everything.

01:07:19.955 --> 01:07:26.330
By that I mean, every time
you go to research something,

01:07:26.330 --> 01:07:29.090
the story winds up being
a lot more complicated

01:07:29.090 --> 01:07:31.190
than you imagined it to be.

01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:33.080
So I'll just give you
a couple of examples.

01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:40.130
I decided that I needed to learn
a little bit about Durham's

01:07:40.130 --> 01:07:42.400
black community
and her growing up.

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.180
And what did that mean?

01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:47.183
And I read a whole lot about it.

01:07:47.183 --> 01:07:49.730
And then I read Proud Shoes.

01:07:49.730 --> 01:07:51.670
And I was just going
to skim Proud Shoes.

01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:53.480
But you start reading
it, and you actually

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:56.830
wind up having to read it
because it's so well written.

01:07:56.830 --> 01:07:59.410
- It's a great book.

01:07:59.410 --> 01:08:03.530
- And the story she tells
is just fascinating.

01:08:03.530 --> 01:08:06.580
I was like, OK, she's
from a black middle class

01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:07.780
community in Durham.

01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:10.990
E. Franklin Frazier wrote this
wonderful essay, "Durham--

01:08:10.990 --> 01:08:12.746
Capital of the
Black Middle Class".

01:08:12.746 --> 01:08:14.620
Lots of the people have
written about Durham.

01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:16.430
Turns out that her family--

01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:18.399
they're both in,
and they're not in.

01:08:18.399 --> 01:08:22.244
That's the key to that
part of Proud Shoes.

01:08:22.244 --> 01:08:24.160
They don't live in West
Durham, which is where

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:25.410
most of the black people live.

01:08:25.410 --> 01:08:27.430
They live out of town.

01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:31.000
There's this little marsh in
the story that's a metaphor.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.060
It's between her house and the
rest of the black community.

01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:38.290
And she talks about encountering
all these other people

01:08:38.290 --> 01:08:40.330
who are on the other
side of the marsh

01:08:40.330 --> 01:08:44.649
and how that's so
difficult and complicated.

01:08:44.649 --> 01:08:47.229
You start to think,
well you have

01:08:47.229 --> 01:08:49.500
to learn about the black
middle class in Durham

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:53.500
to understand her and
where she comes from.

01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:56.080
But it turns out that
she's on the other side

01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:00.140
of this boundary, which she
writes about in Proud Shoes.

01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:01.960
And the boundary is
really complicated.

01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:04.040
And what does it mean?

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:06.250
It means a bunch of
different things.

01:09:06.250 --> 01:09:11.020
But that's like every
story about Murray.

01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:14.340
The Howard Law School story,
which we've all written about.

01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:17.290
And I read it in
her autobiography.

01:09:17.290 --> 01:09:20.439
And I thought I knew
what was going on.

01:09:20.439 --> 01:09:23.229
But the more I delved
into it, the harder

01:09:23.229 --> 01:09:25.620
it was to understand
what was going on.

01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:29.500
Leon Ransom is her mentor.

01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:32.319
He's the Howard law
professor who encourages

01:09:32.319 --> 01:09:35.609
her to apply to law school.

01:09:35.609 --> 01:09:38.319
And she credits him
with saving her.

01:09:38.319 --> 01:09:42.130
But he's also one of
these sexist professors

01:09:42.130 --> 01:09:46.569
that convinces her that
something's really wrong.

01:09:46.569 --> 01:09:50.109
And she's got to put
a better name to it.

01:09:50.109 --> 01:09:53.950
So everything about
Howard is ambiguous.

01:09:53.950 --> 01:09:55.720
She loves being there.

01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:57.790
She loves being
part of that group

01:09:57.790 --> 01:10:03.550
of African-American male
civil rights lawyers.

01:10:03.550 --> 01:10:06.400
But she's also not
part of it as well.

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:08.680
And I think the
relationship with Ransom

01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:12.700
is a metaphor for
the whole thing.

01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:15.790
Ransom is both a
sexist and the person

01:10:15.790 --> 01:10:21.190
who, when she has this failed
affection for this Howard

01:10:21.190 --> 01:10:23.620
undergraduate, she credits
him as the person who

01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:26.650
really stood up for her
when nobody else would.

01:10:29.710 --> 01:10:35.530
So every story about
Murray is like that.

01:10:35.530 --> 01:10:38.050
You think you know the story.

01:10:38.050 --> 01:10:40.720
And you think you
know the boundaries.

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:42.700
But then the boundaries
aren't clear.

01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:45.350
And she's outside of them.

01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:48.972
And the last example
I give is this,

01:10:48.972 --> 01:10:50.680
how to think about
Murray in the present.

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:55.030
And I've gone on record about
this about my skepticism

01:10:55.030 --> 01:11:00.220
about making present
[INAUDIBLE] to Murray.

01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:02.090
But I don't know.

01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:07.420
In 2013, President Obama gives
his second inaugural address.

01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:11.212
And he's talking about the
Declaration of Independence,

01:11:11.212 --> 01:11:12.295
the Civil Rights Movement.

01:11:12.295 --> 01:11:15.400
All of a sudden, he's talking
about gays and lesbians.

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:18.160
And everyone's saying, oh,
what a wonderful thing it is.

01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:23.290
And so I write an op-ed
about Pauli Murray

01:11:23.290 --> 01:11:29.200
and about how she's this
little-known progenitor

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:33.730
of this move that
Obama finally did.

01:11:33.730 --> 01:11:37.110
And it's funny, I caught myself
doing what everybody does--

01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:41.750
you mobilize in Murray
to deal with the present.

01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:43.900
And is that right?

01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:44.900
Is that not right?

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:47.590
I think it is right
because I think--

01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:51.880
my own thesis about Murray was
that it was the boundaries,

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:54.700
that she didn't like
being classified

01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:58.660
as a particular thing, as being
part of a particular group.

01:11:58.660 --> 01:11:59.680
She did, and she didn't.

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:02.530
She was very proud
of being a Negro.

01:12:02.530 --> 01:12:07.090
She's very proud of things
to the end of her life.

01:12:07.090 --> 01:12:12.910
But am I right to say that
when we think about things

01:12:12.910 --> 01:12:17.170
like bathroom bills
and things like that,

01:12:17.170 --> 01:12:19.690
do I know which side
Murray would be on?

01:12:19.690 --> 01:12:20.800
Yeah, I think I am right.

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:23.050
Because she was really
about these boundaries.

01:12:23.050 --> 01:12:26.500
I don't know which way she
would classify herself.

01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:28.360
Her story's always
more complicated

01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:30.010
than we make it out to be.

01:12:30.010 --> 01:12:31.690
But the one thing
that was constant

01:12:31.690 --> 01:12:34.690
was this questioning
of boundaries

01:12:34.690 --> 01:12:37.750
and always seeing [INAUDIBLE]
complicated things

01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:42.910
both helpful to her and harmful
to her at the same time.

01:12:42.910 --> 01:12:45.880
And I think that was the most
surprising thing and the most

01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:49.570
unsettling thing
that I found when I

01:12:49.570 --> 01:12:51.951
was researching Murray's story.

01:12:51.951 --> 01:12:52.450
- Thank you.

01:12:52.450 --> 01:12:54.400
[APPLAUSE]

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:57.450
