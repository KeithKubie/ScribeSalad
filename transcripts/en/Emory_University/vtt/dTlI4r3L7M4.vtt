00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:15.125
At times people really push me to answer the question 
what is the value of higher education? 

00:00:15.125 --> 00:00:20.291
And I have learned that sometimes you 
shouldn’t be rational when you answer that question. 

00:00:20.291 --> 00:00:26.542
Because I find myself wanting to toss out statistics that 
show that there’s tremendous value in higher education. 

00:00:26.542 --> 00:00:32.125
And then I look up and I look at the person sitting across 
from me and I realize that’s not what they’re asking. 

00:00:32.125 --> 00:00:38.500
They are asking something that is much deeper, that is, 
so what is the meaning, what is higher education going to get me? 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:45.208
How do I know that if I have a college degree, my life is 
going to be different than if I don't have a college degree? 

00:00:45.208 --> 00:00:51.166
 We live in a society where so many things that we took for granted, 
so many things that we were convinced 

00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:56.500
were just right, we knew why we were doing it 
and how we were doing it and where it was going to get us. 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:03.083
We have lost that as a society. 
 What an opportunity for a university to not only train its students 

00:01:03.083 --> 00:01:06.834
to start asking those questions, but engage with the broader world. 

00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:12.500
What you need to get out of a college education is 
the ability to communicate, the ability to understand. 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.542
The ability to realize this is the goal 
and what’s the best way to get there?  

00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:22.041
We need to think about the fact that what we are 
doing at Emory is training leaders for the future, 

00:01:22.041 --> 00:01:28.208
people who have a positive impact on society. 
 People who understand the value of evidence and debate.

00:01:28.208 --> 00:01:32.208
 You put those together and almost 
any conversation can be challenged there. 

00:01:32.208 --> 00:01:38.041
 And I am a social scientist, so I try to 
 understand why do people believe what they believe, 

00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:42.792
what does it mean when people act in certain ways 
or have certain perceptions? 

00:01:42.792 --> 00:01:48.000
 And I came to the conclusion that we as
 institutions of higher education have failed 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.500
to demonstrate to the rest of the world 
why we are important. We have failed 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.333
to reinforce the fact that we are part of that world; 
we are not above that world. We are not watching the world. 

00:01:58.333 --> 00:02:05.333
We need to call the question, not just how do we get better 
and better within the indicators that we currently have in place, 

00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:09.375
but how do we ensure that we get better for the future? 

00:02:09.375 --> 00:02:15.750
Because that’s what we need to be part of. And that might 
mean calling questions or it will mean calling questions around 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.417
is the model that we have the right model?
 And I’m not sure it is the right model, but I’m not ready yet to 

00:02:21.417 --> 00:02:24.000
be able to frame what the right model would be. 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.542
But I believe that in the not too distant future 
the model of higher education 

00:02:29.542 --> 00:02:33.875
for a place like Emory will change, has to change. It will be disruptive,

00:02:33.875 --> 00:02:36.959
 like change agents are, but it will get us to a better place 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.792
in terms of the contributions and the value of higher education to society.
