00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
I thought that we could talk about fractions.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.480
So , for instance, one over two.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.920
Also known as one half.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.920
Okay, so another one would be two over five, or two fifths.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.880
And then there are more complicated ones,
like eighteen over forty-two,

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.800
and, well, you know that there is something a little wrong here, which is that the top and the bottom,

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:34.160
you can both divide them by two, and then you get that this is nine over twenty-one.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.720
And, oh, I'm not done.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.080
And so it's three sevenths.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:45.240
I wanted to do this example because all the fractions I'm going to consider are going to be reduced like this.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:51.540
Namely, it's going to be of the form p over q,
where p and q are integers,

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.080
and they are what we call coprime, 
namely that they have no common divisor.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.520
[Brady]: We've cancelled them
down as far as they can go.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.900
[Dr. Bonahon]: That's completely correct, yes.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.320
And now, if you remember, with fractions you can do things:

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.960
you can add them up, or you can multiply them. And multiplication is fairly easy because

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.980
if I want to take, for instance, two over five, two fifths,
and I want to multiply it with three over seven,

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:26.060
I take the two numbers on the top, I multiply them, and I take the two numbers on the bottom and I multiply them,

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.720
and so that gives me six over thirty-five.
That's pretty simple.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.620
However, I don't know if you'll remember this, but

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:45.120
if you want to add them, I'm going to tell you
what it is NOT equal to. I have to put a big "not" like this.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:55.760
So it is NOT two plus three divided by five plus seven,
five over twelve.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.140
I hope you remember that
you're NOT supposed to do that.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.400
So let me remind you of what you are supposed to do.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.840
You're going to reduce them to a common denominator, which in this case will be five times seven.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.260
I just wanted to remind you of
what people told you you should always do.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:23.260
But we could ask ourselves, what if we decide
that this WAS the correct rule?

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.840
[Brady]: We're going to break the rules, are we?

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.620
[Dr. Bonahon]: We're going to break the rules, yes, and we're going to venture in the brand new world.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:36.140
Because I don't want to go against the other people, we're going to create a new addition,

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.360
and to remember it's new, this plus,
I'm going to put a circle around it.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.440
Five over twelve.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:52.620
It's a symbol that we mathematicians, we use a lot, every time we mean, "Well, it's not quite what you think it is."

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.540
We could put a hat on top, we do things like that,
or a tilde.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.580
Okay, and so, let me do it with letters like this p and q.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:12.080
That will mean that p over q, funny addition, p-prime over q-prime

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:21.860
is p plus p-prime divided by q plus q-prime.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.600
Probably you never heard of it, but it's actually well-known among mathematicians,

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.980
and it has a name, and that's called, so I'm going to write, the Farey addition,

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:45.340
named after John Farey, who was mostly known as a geologist in the end of the eighteenth century.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:54.200
My intention is to show you that this funny addition actually comes up in two very different contexts,

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:00.540
the original one discovered by Farey and another one, which would be called the Ford circles.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.000
What we are going to do is that we're going to list all possible fractions.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.080
There are a lot of numbers so we're going to only to focus on the ones between zero and one. That's going to shrink.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:21.240
So here is the number line, and I'm going to be between zero and one.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:28.380
And by the way, one is a fraction: it's one over one. Zero is also a fraction: zero over one,

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:36.240
There is one half, one fourth, three fourths, and then there is one third which is probably somewhere like here,

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:44.440
Two thirds, somewhere like this -and of course, I can keep going for a long time because there are infinitely many numbers.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:55.840
So what I'm gong to do is that I'm going to stop and I'm gong to take the numbers p, q, so first of all between zero (including zero) and one,

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:04.920
and then where q, well, I cannot go infinitely so I'm going to assume q is going to be less than a certain number,

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:13.020
so let's say 234. There is nothing special about 234. It's just 2, 3, 4.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.240
I don't have much imagination when picking numbers.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:26.580
So I'm going to do it, and I started doing it, and there are quite a few numbers like that, probably between twenty and forty thousand.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:33.580
So perhaps I'm not going to do it in front of you. I have a computer. And so I did it.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.920
[Brady]: That's not twenty thousand fractions!
[Dr. Bonahon]: I only got a little piece of it,

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.840
because when I use my computer I got pages and pages and pages and pages...

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:52.080
So I got all these numbers between [119] over 81 and 103 over 154.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:06:00.700
If you think about it, it's about two thirds. So one is just a little below and one is a little after,

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:07.500
and actually there should be two thirds somewhere...
Ah yes, here.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.640
It's a very small piece of the whole list.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:19.780
So we get all the numbers in that very small interval and they are in order. They come up in this order exactly.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:26.240
And so, that looks like -- there doesn't seem to be anything special about this list, right?

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.620
You remember that funny addition where you add up the two numbers at the top and the two bottom?

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:41.360
You see it here. Look, for instance: you take these three numbers here; look at the one in the middle.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:48.020
148, well that's exactly the sum of 123 and of 25.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:55.480
And then 225, that's exactly the sum of 187 and 38.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:00.180
And you see that in many, many places.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.420
So let's see if we can find another one like that. Okay.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:17.360
Look, hundred -- these three, I mean.
103 plus 35, 138. 156 plus 53, 209.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:28.320
31 plus 95, that's 126. 47 for 144, 191.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:34.900
And it's pretty clear that there are examples where this is not one of those Farey additions.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:42.420
Like, you have the ones where in the middle the term is way, way smaller. Look at this one here.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:48.300
If I take the sum of the two -- the Farey sum of the two on the edges,

00:07:48.300 --> 00:08:01.540
so that [it] gives me 212 divided by 320, and on the paper it's 53 over 80. That's not the same, right?

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:06.220
Well, except, wait a minute. You remember how I can simplify fractions?

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:14.180
Look, clearly the top and the bottom I can divide by two. I can cancel out. There is also two as a factor here.

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:21.160
I divide by two the top and the bottom (I'm going a little fast) -- over eighty -- hey hey!

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.280
[Brady]: So that was a Farey sum.
[Dr. Bonahon]: That's a Farey sum.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:31.320
And so, let me show you how to pick a Farey sum in this piece of paper.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.060
What you do is.. this.

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:45.640
Every time I take three consecutive numbers here, then the one in the middle is the Farey sum of the two on the sides.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:54.440
And what's amazing is that when I change my number, 234 here, if I take something else, like for instance if I take 200,

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.940
then I'm losing this number, it will not be on my list anymore;

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:06.540
however, the next -- the one that is closest, that's going to be this one probably, will still have this property.

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.440
It's very surprising, to some extent unbelievable,

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:18.940
and it took a while for mathematicians to be able to devise a complete proof of that result.

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:27.560
The one who did that was Cauchy, one of the great mathematicians of the nineteenth century.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:31.880
When we find something really surprising,
we want to know:

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:38.620
Is this a coincidence, or is there  a deep fact behind that? Or at least, is this always true?

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:43.540
I'm going to do some geometry and construct circles.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:50.320
I'm going to use the number line that I had here, but here is the following recipe that I want to use:

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:58.240
Whenever I see the number p over q, again where p and q have no common divisors,

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:07.560
then I'm going to draw the circle which is tangent to the number line, which is above the number line,

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:22.120
and whose diameter is.. well, I could use any formula, but my pinky tells me I should use one over q squared.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:28.560
Let's do it. So, one half.
At the bottom I have two, q is equal to two,

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:35.280
so I'm going to want one over two squared, namely one over four. So it sort of looks roughly like this.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:44.440
Let's do one third here, one ninth -- oh, this one I don't completely know, but my pinky just told me that it touches like this.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:50.320
And then one quarter -- my pinky is
better than my drawing skills.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:57.980
And then here, by the way, is one over one, I had to draw the circle of radius [diameter] one over one squared, namely one,

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:04.880
it's this big circle here, and it turns out that it's going to look the same with this one here.

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:12.440
And then I can keep going, but as you -- I think I convinced you of one thing, which is that my drawing skills are not very good.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.160
But fortunately, I have my trusted computer.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:24.520
So, it's much smaller than this. This is the circle going at zero over one, diameter one.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:34.540
The one going over one, one over one, diameter one, one, one, so these big circles are all above the integers,

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:40.660
and then above the half integers I'm going to get a circle of radius [diameter] one quarter,

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:45.320
and then above the multiples of one third, I don't know if you can see --

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:51.780
one third, I have a circle of radius [diameter] one ninth, and then it's beginning to be really hard to see.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:12:00.040
I can also use my computer and, look, here there is one third and one half.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:07.340
I'm zooming in: one third, one half, and then it's what you have in between. And you have that.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:12.860
And then you have more. And then you could go, I don't know, like this, or how about here,

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:17.420
between five over eleven and six over thirteen. And it keeps going.

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:27.280
Okay. So it is funny that with my funny rules like this, all these circles, you see, they are tangent to each other.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:34.880
They touch, but they don't overlap, and there is no space in between, they do touch.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:42.640
This is called the Ford Circle Packing. And actually, there is some geometry here that you can show.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:49.980
When you have two of these circles which touch each other, and then you have the number line here,

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:55.960
there is a unique circle which touches the number line and these two circles here.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.460
Okay? That's a little bit of a geometrical fact.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:02.000
Look, look look look, at this.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.660
So I was taking this one: eleven over twenty-four, seventeen over thirty-seven,

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:18.020
and the one that touches these two circles and the number line, that's.. oh my God, that's twenty-eight over sixty-one!

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:26.800
Eleven plus seventeen, that's twenty-eight; twenty-four plus thirty-seven, that's sixty-one.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.740
[Brady]: It's -- gah, what have you done?! It's back!
[Dr. Bonahon]: It's coming back!

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:37.380
So we have these Farey additions
everywhere in this picture.

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:46.460
Again, this is true for any three circles that touch each other like that in this whole picture, like this one here.

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:51.220
This pattern is closely related to non-euclidean geometry.

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:56.600
I cannot completely explain the details, but there is something deep behind that.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:03.020
...origin point. So you can deductively reason what happens here

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.680
Okay Brady. So this big circle is this one

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:13.280
and this circle is this one. Now what happens to this circle here?

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:17.300
Well, again, we don't have to measure anything

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:21.680
This circle here touches the big circle, and touches this circle...
