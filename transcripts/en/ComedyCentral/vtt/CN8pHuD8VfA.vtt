00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:05.972
- My dad's a Holocaust survivor

00:00:05.972 --> 00:00:08.541
and the one thing he
always talked about

00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:11.911
in the Holocaust was that
it was really difficult

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:13.446
to find good weed.

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:16.516
So the way I honor the
memory of the fallen Jews

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:19.019 align:start size:97% position:3%
is that I was going to
smuggle these pot gummy bears

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.688
into Sydney, Australia.

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:24.257
(techno music)

00:00:44.277 --> 00:00:46.046
Thank you everybody

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:47.514 align:start size:88% position:13%
If you don't know,
here's what the show is.

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:48.681
It's just a bunch of people

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:50.116 align:start size:84% position:16%
and we're all
telling true stories.

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:53.119 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Host] Ladies and
gentlemen, Ari Shaffir.

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:55.555
(crowd cheering)

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:58.458
- So my story's this,
I went to Australia.

00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:00.026 align:start size:81% position:19%
Has anyone ever
been to Australia?

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:01.227
(crowd cheers)

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:02.829 align:start size:84% position:16%
You have really,
when were you there?

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.097 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Woman From
Audience] 10 years ago.

00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:05.999
- 10 years ago, how
long was the flight?

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.866
- [Woman From Audience] Forever.

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.134
- Forever, yeah.

00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:09.135
You gotta consider
killing yourself.

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:10.837
My flight was 13 hours.

00:01:10.837 --> 00:01:11.938
It's so fucking long.

00:01:11.938 --> 00:01:13.239
What were you on?

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:14.774
- [Man From Audience] A 747.

00:01:14.774 --> 00:01:15.608
- 747? No.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.712
That's not what I
was talking about.

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:22.449
(crowd laughing)

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:25.919
- I can see how you would think

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:28.154 align:start size:84% position:16%
that's what I was
talking about, but no.

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:29.622
What I said "what are you on,"

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:32.692
I mean what drug did
you take to survive

00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:34.527
the 13 hours in a 747.

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:38.264
Nothing, you got drunk,
did you do anything?

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:39.532 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Man From Audience]
I had a drink.

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:41.701
- Okay that's fair
that's a drug too.

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:43.103
I take pot cookies with me.

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:44.604
People take anything.

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:46.039
I've had friends take like,
you know sleeping pills,

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.974 align:start size:97% position:3%
a lot of people take sleeping
pills before they go.

00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:49.742
My one friend took coke.

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:51.010
(crowd laughing)

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.445
I was like, dude
do what you want,

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:55.515
but that seems like the
wrong time to take coke.

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:57.717
(crowd laughing)

00:01:57.717 --> 00:01:59.219
So I take pot cookiies with me,

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.720
that's what I do,
I take pot cookies.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.555
And that's the best thing
about living in Los Angelos

00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:05.725 align:start size:94% position:6%
is you just go to the
store and buy pot cookies.

00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:08.361 align:start size:84% position:16%
They come in wrappers
so you can tell

00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:10.597
how many calories are in there.

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:13.066
And whether or not
they're gluten free.

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:14.701
We live in the future you guys,

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:16.903
where we are is the future,
it's the greatest thing.

00:02:16.903 --> 00:02:18.838
So I took these pot
cookies with me.

00:02:18.838 --> 00:02:20.573 align:start size:84% position:16%
I took them all
out of the wrapper.

00:02:20.573 --> 00:02:22.775
And I put 'em in a
Tupperware container.

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:25.778
And I had my friend's wife
write on the Tupperware box,

00:02:25.778 --> 00:02:28.882
"We miss you honey enjoy
the cookies, love Mom."

00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:32.886
Yeah, and I got on PTSA
'cus they don't so shit

00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:34.687 align:start size:88% position:13%
and so we're sitting
there, me and my friend,

00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:36.189
and we got bumped
up to first class.

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:38.191
It was so fucking awesome.

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:39.993
13 hours in first class.

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:42.595 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's one of those things
where they give you full beds.

00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:45.298 align:start size:97% position:3%
They give you pajamas
before you get on the plane.

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:48.968
Pajamas and two socks to
masturbate into, I assumed.

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:51.104
(crowd laughing)

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:53.573
But two, two masturbation socks.

00:02:53.573 --> 00:02:56.142
(crowd laughing)

00:02:56.142 --> 00:02:58.645
The luxury on Quantas oh.

00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:02.448 align:start size:97% position:3%
So anyway we took off and
the seat belt light went off

00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:05.418 align:start size:94% position:6%
and as soon as it went
off and went to my friend,

00:03:05.418 --> 00:03:06.886
"Hey you ready for
some pot cookies?"

00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:09.489 align:start size:94% position:6%
And I cracked open the
Tupperware and the reek of

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.660 align:start size:97% position:3%
marijuana just filled up the
entire first class cabin.

00:03:14.994 --> 00:03:16.663
(crowd laughing)

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:18.097 align:start size:81% position:19%
It was like an
Iron Maiden poster

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:20.700 align:start size:94% position:6%
the way it was all fucking
coming out of there.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.202
My friend was like,
"Dude what the fuck,

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:24.337 align:start size:84% position:16%
"put that away what
are you doing?"

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:27.373 align:start size:88% position:13%
And I was like, "Oh
shit, eat some, hurry!"

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:29.509
And I ate as much as
I could and I shut it.

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:31.277 align:start size:94% position:6%
And from then on whenever
I had to get more

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:33.046
I would go to the bathroom.

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:35.381
And I would open it
right by the toilet.

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:38.785
I'd flush a bunch of
times to clear the air.

00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:40.420
I don't know how science works,

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.922
but it seems like
that should work.

00:03:42.922 --> 00:03:44.290
(crowd laughing)

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.859
Still even then, when I got out

00:03:48.261 --> 00:03:49.529
if someone was waiting for me

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:51.998
I'd be like, "Hey I just
took like a really minty

00:03:51.998 --> 00:03:54.434
"dump in there so I'm sorry."

00:03:55.835 --> 00:03:57.770 align:start size:94% position:6%
So it was great the
whole flight was amazing.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.673
We landed I had three
pot cookies left over.

00:04:00.673 --> 00:04:02.709 align:start size:84% position:16%
So I ate one, I gave
one to my friend,

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.210
and I took the last one
I just threw it away

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.045
in the airplane bathroom.

00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:07.914
Look at how hurt you are look.

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:10.850 align:start size:88% position:13%
I had a lot of pot
cookies the whole time.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.385 align:start size:84% position:16%
I was worried, 'cus
they make you fill out

00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:15.088 align:start size:94% position:6%
these forms of what
produce you're bringing in

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:17.357 align:start size:97% position:3%
so I thought maybe they
had drug dogs or something.

00:04:17.357 --> 00:04:19.525
I don't know, I just got scared.

00:04:19.525 --> 00:04:21.694
And they actually
did have drug dogs

00:04:21.694 --> 00:04:23.162
so I was like "Okay good."

00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:24.998
So that was like five years ago.

00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:27.233
Cut to last October,
I just went again.

00:04:27.233 --> 00:04:29.769 align:start size:88% position:13%
And this time I took
with me pot gummy bears.

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:32.905 align:start size:84% position:16%
Yeah the technology
has improved.

00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:34.073
(crowd laughing)

00:04:34.073 --> 00:04:36.442
Los gumies hermanos.

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:37.977
They're amazing.

00:04:37.977 --> 00:04:39.279
And for seven dollars you
can get a cherry flavored

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:43.116
gummy bear that'll fuck
you up for five hours.

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:47.854 align:start size:97% position:3%
Changes the game on
flights, make it way better.

00:04:47.854 --> 00:04:49.222
There's no more bad
flights after that.

00:04:49.222 --> 00:04:50.456
There's no more bad flights.

00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:52.825
You can get stuck in
between two fat dudes,

00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:54.861
and instead of being
upset you're just like,

00:04:54.861 --> 00:04:57.297
"You guys are so soft."

00:04:57.297 --> 00:05:00.066
(crowd laughing)

00:05:03.036 --> 00:05:04.504
"How did you get that soft?

00:05:04.504 --> 00:05:08.574 align:start size:97% position:3%
"You're the softest two people
I've ever met in my life."

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:11.344
It's awesome.

00:05:11.344 --> 00:05:13.446
So this time I did not get
bumped up to first class.

00:05:13.446 --> 00:05:16.382 align:start size:84% position:16%
I just flew regular,
peasant class.

00:05:18.351 --> 00:05:21.054 align:start size:97% position:3%
And it was great, but the
pot gummy bears were amazing.

00:05:21.054 --> 00:05:23.623 align:start size:97% position:3%
So I slept for like eight
hours of the trip this time.

00:05:23.623 --> 00:05:27.460 align:start position:0%
And so when I landed I had
seven pot gummy bears left over.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.495
And I went to throw them away
again when we were landing

00:05:29.495 --> 00:05:30.997
I wanted to chuck 'em,

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:33.132 align:start size:97% position:3%
but then I got to the bathroom
and I thought about my dad.

00:05:33.132 --> 00:05:35.368 align:start size:88% position:13%
And my dad's a Holocaust
survivor, for real.

00:05:35.368 --> 00:05:38.571 align:start size:94% position:6%
He's 81, and the one thing
he always talked about

00:05:38.571 --> 00:05:41.074
in the Holocaust was that
it was really difficult

00:05:41.074 --> 00:05:42.575
to find good weed.

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:46.279
(crowd laughing)

00:05:50.216 --> 00:05:53.453
So the way I honor the
memory of the fallen Jews

00:05:53.453 --> 00:05:56.255 align:start size:97% position:3%
is that I was going to
smuggle these pot gummy bears

00:05:56.255 --> 00:05:58.891
into Sydney, Australia.

00:05:58.891 --> 00:06:02.128
That's how I would never forget.

00:06:02.128 --> 00:06:03.896
So here's my plan, I
came up with a plan.

00:06:03.896 --> 00:06:05.932 align:start size:84% position:16%
I had these macadamia
nuts in my bag.

00:06:05.932 --> 00:06:08.401
And I was gonna say if the
drug dog smelled anything

00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:09.702
I was just gonna say
they were smelling

00:06:09.702 --> 00:06:11.270
the macadamia nuts.

00:06:12.338 --> 00:06:14.173
That's it, that's the plan.

00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:16.409
(crowd laughing)

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:17.643
When you hear it out loud,

00:06:17.643 --> 00:06:19.779
it doesn't sound
that good at all,

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:21.714
but man I was so high
when I came up with it

00:06:21.714 --> 00:06:24.650
it seemed like a perfect plan.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.085
And super hilarious.

00:06:26.085 --> 00:06:30.123
So you get out and
as you get into line,

00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:33.559 align:start size:84% position:16%
they put you in
this custom's line.

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:35.728 align:start size:94% position:6%
And you put your bags down
and they have this dog,

00:06:35.728 --> 00:06:39.699
this Jack Russell terrier
and he's wearing a uniform.

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:41.234
And they bring this
dog, they take it

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:42.702
and they bring it by your bag.

00:06:42.702 --> 00:06:45.505 align:start size:97% position:3%
And this dog, let's say
this was the bag it was in,

00:06:45.505 --> 00:06:46.939 align:start size:88% position:13%
and the pot gummy
bears were right there.

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:48.808 align:start size:84% position:16%
This dog went right
to that pocket

00:06:48.808 --> 00:06:50.543
and starts going like that.

00:06:50.543 --> 00:06:52.345
Just starts tapping
at it with his paw.

00:06:52.345 --> 00:06:56.449
And in my head I'm thinking,
"Get the fuck out of here."

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:59.252 align:start size:84% position:16%
"Dog are you kidding
me right now?

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:03.289
That's the worst place
possible for you to be.

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:06.325
That's where I keep my drugs."

00:07:06.325 --> 00:07:09.095
(crowd laughing)

00:07:10.296 --> 00:07:11.764
I'm trying to be cool,
I'm trying to be like,

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:15.802 align:start size:97% position:3%
"Great architecture they
have here, it's so amazing."

00:07:15.802 --> 00:07:16.636
Wow, cool.

00:07:19.205 --> 00:07:20.740
So anyway the guy
goes, "Wait here."

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.241
And he goes and takes the dog

00:07:22.241 --> 00:07:24.043
to smell a bunch of
other people's bags.

00:07:24.043 --> 00:07:25.278
Dog smells nothing.

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:26.579
Just does figure eights
in between their bags.

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:28.214
Can't wait to get
back to my bag.

00:07:28.214 --> 00:07:29.182
It's like a treat for him.

00:07:29.182 --> 00:07:30.082
"Fuckin' let's do this."

00:07:30.082 --> 00:07:32.084
He was running this way.

00:07:33.853 --> 00:07:37.390
And went right back to it and
starts pawing at it again.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.659
At this point I'm pouring sweat.

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:42.829 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'm like this is how
Locked Up Abroad starts.

00:07:42.829 --> 00:07:44.263
You know what I mean?

00:07:44.263 --> 00:07:45.832 align:start size:97% position:3%
Some asshole trying to smuggle
35 dollars worth of weed

00:07:45.832 --> 00:07:48.067
onto another continent.

00:07:48.067 --> 00:07:50.169 align:start size:84% position:16%
Blaming his Holocaust
survivor father.

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:52.572
He's really just a cheap Jew.

00:07:54.907 --> 00:07:56.943 align:start size:88% position:13%
And so the guy, he
looks at me and he goes,

00:07:56.943 --> 00:08:00.079
"What's going on in the bag?"

00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:03.249
And I was like, "I
have macadamia nuts.

00:08:07.587 --> 00:08:12.058 align:start size:97% position:3%
"I think the dog, okay
macadamia nuts have a pungent

00:08:12.058 --> 00:08:14.827 align:start size:84% position:16%
"(sighs) what I
believe is happening

00:08:14.827 --> 00:08:17.697
"is that the dog with
his keen sense of smell

00:08:17.697 --> 00:08:21.300
"went by and 'cus the
macadamia nuts I have

00:08:22.768 --> 00:08:25.605
"that the dog is
triggered by that

00:08:26.739 --> 00:08:29.909 align:start size:81% position:19%
"and macadamia
nuts is my answer.

00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:31.544
"Macadamia nuts."

00:08:31.544 --> 00:08:33.012 align:start size:84% position:16%
And he just looks
at me, he just goes,

00:08:33.012 --> 00:08:36.415 align:start size:94% position:6%
"No he's not trying to
smell for macadamia nuts."

00:08:36.415 --> 00:08:40.520
I was like, "Oh fuck, why
didn't I research this?

00:08:41.687 --> 00:08:43.890
"The wi-fi costs seven
dollars for an hour.

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:46.526
"I totally could
have gotten it."

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:48.895 align:start size:88% position:13%
And he goes, "They're
just trying to smell for

00:08:48.895 --> 00:08:51.197
"fruit and for drugs."

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:54.700 align:start size:97% position:3%
And in my head I was thinking
like, "Oh fuck, fruit.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.702
"I had so much access to that."

00:08:56.702 --> 00:08:58.671
He goes, "Do you have
any fruit in there?"

00:08:58.671 --> 00:09:00.406
And I was like, "No."

00:09:04.143 --> 00:09:08.314 align:start position:0%
It was so easy they were giving
away bananas on the plane.

00:09:10.182 --> 00:09:12.818
I was like, "I'm good I
got my macadamia nuts."

00:09:12.818 --> 00:09:14.287
So I didn't take any.

00:09:14.287 --> 00:09:16.255 align:start size:97% position:3%
And at this point I'm like,
okay I'm going to jail.

00:09:16.255 --> 00:09:17.189
There's no way around it.

00:09:17.189 --> 00:09:18.357
I'm going to an Australian jail.

00:09:18.357 --> 00:09:20.159 align:start size:84% position:16%
I've never heard
about Australian jails

00:09:20.159 --> 00:09:22.061
maybe they're okay,
maybe they're bad.

00:09:22.061 --> 00:09:23.129 align:start size:88% position:13%
I would have heard
about them if they were

00:09:23.129 --> 00:09:24.497
exceptionally bad.

00:09:24.497 --> 00:09:25.932
They started as a prison colony,

00:09:25.932 --> 00:09:28.167 align:start size:97% position:3%
they probably got jails really
well down at that point.

00:09:28.167 --> 00:09:29.101
They probably know how to do it,

00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:30.603
but I just got calm.

00:09:30.603 --> 00:09:32.338
Like at some point when you
know you're getting caught

00:09:32.338 --> 00:09:34.473
you don't even get
nervous anymore.

00:09:34.473 --> 00:09:36.108
It's just going to happen.

00:09:36.108 --> 00:09:37.476
You know?

00:09:37.476 --> 00:09:38.744 align:start size:84% position:16%
I love how all the
black people are like,

00:09:38.744 --> 00:09:40.846
"Yeah that is how
you get arrested."

00:09:40.846 --> 00:09:42.048
You guys are all talking.

00:09:42.048 --> 00:09:43.316 align:start size:81% position:19%
I made sure to
look away from you

00:09:43.316 --> 00:09:44.550
when I was talking about arrest,

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:47.653 align:start size:88% position:13%
but then I was like they
look like they know.

00:09:47.653 --> 00:09:50.456
(crowd laughing)

00:09:50.456 --> 00:09:51.390 align:start size:88% position:13%
They really were looking
at each other like,

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.759
"Yeah it'll get like that."

00:09:53.759 --> 00:09:55.127
Here's what I compare it to.

00:09:55.127 --> 00:09:56.996 align:start size:81% position:19%
Tell me if it's
true for you guys.

00:09:56.996 --> 00:09:58.331
You know those nature videos

00:09:58.331 --> 00:10:00.633
where a lion or tiger
will kill some animal

00:10:00.633 --> 00:10:02.969
like a zebra and for a
while like kicks and shit

00:10:02.969 --> 00:10:04.470
and tries to get 'em off,

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:06.706
but as soon as the lion gets
a really good grad at the neck

00:10:06.706 --> 00:10:09.942
the zebra just goes,
"Yeah, whatever bro."

00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:11.310
(crowd laughing)

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:13.212
"Do what you gotta
do it's your game."

00:10:13.212 --> 00:10:14.480
That's how I was.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.681
Like alright let's
see what happens.

00:10:15.681 --> 00:10:18.451 align:start size:88% position:13%
And then out of nowhere,
just out of nowhere.

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:21.354
Their custom's guy, he
just gives me this out.

00:10:21.354 --> 00:10:22.822
He was just like,

00:10:22.822 --> 00:10:26.592
"Is it possible that
maybe earlier you had

00:10:26.592 --> 00:10:30.763 align:start size:97% position:3%
"an apple or something and
then you rested it on the bag?

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:38.070
"Is that possible?"

00:10:39.672 --> 00:10:41.107
And I was like...

00:10:42.241 --> 00:10:45.011
(crowd laughing)

00:10:51.117 --> 00:10:55.287 align:start size:97% position:3%
"Yes. That thing you said
that's what happened to me."

00:10:59.191 --> 00:11:01.360 align:start size:94% position:6%
And he just goes, he looks
at me, and just goes,

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.528
"Yeah okay."

00:11:02.528 --> 00:11:04.463 align:start size:84% position:16%
And he fuckin'
pulled the dog away.

00:11:04.463 --> 00:11:08.634
I was so worried I got the
fuck out of there instantly.

00:11:09.869 --> 00:11:11.370
Yeah, my friends are like,

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:13.039 align:start size:94% position:6%
"See that's proof that you
shouldn't do that shit,

00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:15.174 align:start size:84% position:16%
"you shouldn't smuggle
drugs in with you."

00:11:15.174 --> 00:11:16.208 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I was like,
"Nope, that's a case

00:11:16.208 --> 00:11:19.178
"where I did not
get in trouble."

00:11:19.178 --> 00:11:20.980 align:start size:88% position:13%
There were no
repercussions, of course

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.949 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm going to
continue doing that.

00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:25.718
(crowd laughing)

00:11:25.718 --> 00:11:27.887
The only person I feel
bad for in the story,

00:11:27.887 --> 00:11:31.290
the only one I feel
bad for is the dog.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:32.491
The dog must have been like,

00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:35.327
"What the fuck else
do I have to do?

00:11:36.462 --> 00:11:37.730
"We agreed upon a signal.

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:39.465
"I'll go like this
when I find drugs.

00:11:39.465 --> 00:11:42.268
"What was I doing? I was
giving you the signal.

00:11:42.268 --> 00:11:45.271 align:start size:97% position:3%
"Here are the drugs, here
are the drugs I keep saying.

00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:46.772
"You keep bringing up apples.

00:11:46.772 --> 00:11:50.176 align:start position:0%
"Nobody gives a shit about
apples bro. They're legal here."

00:11:50.176 --> 00:11:51.444
(crowd laughing)

00:11:51.444 --> 00:11:54.246 align:start size:84% position:16%
Alright thank you
very much everybody.
