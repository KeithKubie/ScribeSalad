00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.490
So that was the pre-conditions and as is

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.520
usually the case the pre-conditions
are easier than the post-conditions.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.460
So we want to next look at the what
it means, assuming that we've past

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.140
the pre-conditions,
to actually check something out.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.390
What affect is that going to
have on our information system.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.148
Okay, so take a minute and think what
you expect to happen when the item is

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:25.657
checked out and list them in English.

00:00:25.657 --> 00:00:30.630
&gt;&gt; So I think my mom was
the obvious post condition is

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.672
now the book's checked out.

00:00:33.672 --> 00:00:38.135
So a way to say that or express that I
thought wouldn't go back to that item's

00:00:38.135 --> 00:00:42.184
currently checked out operation that
belongs to the patron class and

00:00:42.184 --> 00:00:46.512
say that the set that's returned from
that operation should contain this

00:00:46.512 --> 00:00:49.530
new loanable item that's
been checked out.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.890
&gt;&gt; So, this raises
an interesting [COUGH] issue.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.396
So we're specifying an operation.

00:00:57.396 --> 00:01:01.205
And we're specifying one operation
in terms of another operation.

00:01:01.205 --> 00:01:02.180
Okay?.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.360
And we can do that, that's fine.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.350
However, the real change of state here

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.419
has to do, so
the items currently checked out.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.220
Is a query operation
that reflects the state.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.800
We could more directly say what's
the change in the state, okay?

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.650
So what other post
condition do you have?

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.370
&gt;&gt; So the other condition I have I
think is more related to this, I guess,

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.120
is that a checked out, we have that, a
class represented on our email diagram.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.050
There has to be an instance
of that now for

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.770
this particular operation
that has just occurred.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:46.590
&gt;&gt; Okay.
So

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.620
we have the association
class checked out.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:50.303
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; And

00:01:50.303 --> 00:01:53.550
[COUGH] the effect of
checking out something new

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.540
would mean that there's another
link in that association class.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.850
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Instance of that.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.550
And, if there is another link there,
then, by implication,

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.780
the items currently checked
out will return that new item.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:08.320
&gt;&gt; Correct.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.430
&gt;&gt; So
we don't have to state both of those.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.320
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; We only have to say

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.570
that the association has one more thing
in it and we get the other one for free.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.410
However, there's another post condition.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.300
Recall the business about requests.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.410
Okay, so
what would the post condition there be?

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.470
&gt;&gt; So, the request queue is now
one less than it was prior.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.870
Someone has such it
popped off the queue,

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.020
because a checked out
operation has occurred.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.390
&gt;&gt; Well, it had better be you,
because you're doing the checking out.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.460
We can't just get rid
of an arbitrary person.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.830
&gt;&gt; The implied patron
should be the one who's-

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:45.552
&gt;&gt; Right, okay.

00:02:45.552 --> 00:02:50.586
So, we already have
a precondition which says that

00:02:50.586 --> 00:02:55.622
this particular patron is
eligible because either

00:02:55.622 --> 00:03:02.350
there's no request in which case
there's nothing to pop off.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.309
Or if there is a request out there, the
first one on the list had better be you.

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:14.925
So in that latter contingency we do want
to pop off your name, okay from there.

00:03:14.925 --> 00:03:18.048
So we're going to state the post
condition but it's going to be a little

00:03:18.048 --> 00:03:21.380
tricky to state because it's only in
the case where you were on the list.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.240
&gt;&gt; Right, and it sounds like
an implication because we just had like

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.638
another only if the case of
it's a child this happens.

00:03:26.638 --> 00:03:30.888
So only if the case that you were
the patron on the checkout request list.

00:03:30.888 --> 00:03:31.863
&gt;&gt; Bingo.

00:03:31.863 --> 00:03:33.540
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool.
