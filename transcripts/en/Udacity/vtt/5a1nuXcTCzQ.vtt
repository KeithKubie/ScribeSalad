00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.580
Our eyes naturally follow patterns when we look at things.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:04.900
We usually start in the top left,

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.560
and then we'll look from left to right, and then top to bottom.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.010
Traditional print media takes advantage of the patterns our eyes follow, and so

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.220
do websites.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.510
For instance, with our website here,

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.210
we have the title at the top because we want the title to

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.160
be the first thing that people see when they click on our website.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.970
After they get past the title, they'll move down and at the left we have images.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.680
These images are here to capture attention,

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.230
because people will look at the images first.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.650
Then they'll see the headline.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.800
And then once they read the headline, they'll go down to the text below it.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.080
This type of design follows what we call a grid based layout, and

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.700
in fact many if not all websites, follow a grid based layout.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.290
Here we are on the Udacity courses page.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.410
It's pretty easy to pick out the grid on this page.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.660
We can see that there's a main column on

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.890
the left that's broken into smaller grids, and then on the right,

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.310
we have this large column that's broken into smaller grids.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.040
In fact, we can keep breaking it down into smaller and smaller grids.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.110
Other websites like the New York Times do the same thing.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.070
It's pretty easy to see how the New York Times is broken into grids.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.020
And we can keep going breaking it into smaller and smaller pieces of the grid.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.190
Next time you're on a website, try to break it apart into grids.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.550
You'll be surprised how easy it is.
