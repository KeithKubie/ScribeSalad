structure of the video essay will just

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989
structure of the video essay will just
 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.260

beginning is that you're confident and

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430
beginning is that you're confident and
 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.070

to do this that you give them you know

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580
to do this that you give them you know
 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.460
