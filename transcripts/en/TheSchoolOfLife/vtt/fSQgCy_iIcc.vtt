00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:13.100
Most people agree that we need to improve
our economic system somehow. Yet we’re also

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:19.060
often keen to dismiss the ideas of capitalism’s
most famous and ambitious critic, Karl Marx.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.670
This isn’t very surprising. In practice,

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.380
his political and economic ideas have been
used to design disastrously planned economies

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.260
and nasty dictatorships.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.160
Nevertheless, we shouldn’t reject Marx too
quickly. We ought to see him as a guide whose

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.120
diagnosis of Capitalism’s ills helps us
navigate towards a more promising future.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.079
Capitalism is going to have be reformed - and
Marx’s analyse are going to be part of any

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.739
answer.
Marx was born in 1818 in Trier, Germany.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.640
Soon he became involved with the Communist

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.440
party, a tiny group of intellectuals advocating
for the overthrow of the class system and

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.399
the abolition of private property. He worked
as a journalist and had to flee Germany, eventually

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.239
settling in London.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.600
Marx wrote an enormous number of books and
articles, sometimes with his friend Friedrich Engels

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.800
Mostly, Marx wrote about Capitalism, the type
of economy that dominates the western world.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.780
It was, in his day, still getting going, and
Marx was one of its most intelligent and perceptive critics.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.610
These were some of the problems he identified
with it:

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.350
Modern work is “alienated”
One of Marx’s greatest insights is that

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.640
work can be one of the sources of our greatest
joys.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.780
But in order to be fulfilled at work, Marx
wrote that workers need ‘to see themselves

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.780
in the objects they have created’. Think
of the person who built this chair:

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.120
it is straightforward, strong, honest and elegant

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.920
It’s an example of how, at its
best, labour offers us a chance to externalise

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.340
what’s good inside us. But this is increasingly
rare in the modern world.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.890
Part of the problem is that modern work is
incredibly specialised. Specialised jobs make

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.560
the modern economy highly efficient, but they
also mean that it is seldom possible for any

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.630
one worker to derive a sense of the genuine
contribution they might be making to the real

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.689
needs of humanity.
Marx argued that modern work leads to

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:14.209
alienation = Entfremdung

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.960
in other words, a feeling of disconnection
between what you do all day and who you feel

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.110
you really are and what you think you ideally be able to
contribute to existence.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.650
Modern work is insecure
Capitalism makes the human being utterly expendable;

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.260
just one factor among others in the forces
of production that can ruthlessly be let go

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.650
the minute that costs rise or savings can
be made through technology. And yet, as Marx

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.819
knew, deep inside of us, we don’t want to
be arbitrarily let go, we are terrified of

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.030
being abandoned.
Communism isn’t just an economic theory.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.580
Understood emotionally, it expresses a deep-seated
longing that we always have a place in the

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.879
world’s heart, that we will not be cast
out.

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.379
Workers get paid little while capitalists
get rich

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:07.550
This is perhaps the most obvious qualm Marx
had with Capitalism. In particular, he believed

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.450
that capitalists shrunk the wages of the labourers
as much as possible in order to skim off a

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.340
wide profit margin.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.340
He called this
 primitive accumulation = ursprüngliche Akkumulation

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:24.940
Whereas capitalists see profit as a reward
for ingenuity and technological talent, Marx

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.330
was far more damning. Profit is simply theft,
and what you are stealing is the talent and

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.650
hard work of your work force.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.510
However much one dresses up the fundamentals,
Marx insists that at its crudest, capitalism

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.050
means paying a worker one price for doing
something that can be sold for another, much

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.950
higher one. Profit is a fancy term for exploitation.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.740
Capitalism is very unstable

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.700
Marx proposed that capitalist systems are
characterised by series of crises. Every crisis

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:02.299
is dressed up by capitalists as being somehow
freakish and rare and soon to be the last one. Far from it, argued Marx,

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:08.159
crises are endemic to capitalism - and they’re  
caused by something very odd. The fact that

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:14.010
we’re able to produce too much - far more
than anyone needs to consume.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:20.629
Capitalist crises are crises of abundance,
rather than - as in the past - crises of shortage.

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:25.639
Our factories and systems are so efficient,
we could give everyone on this planet a car,

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.080
a house, access to a decent school and hospital.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:35.809
That’s what so enraged Marx and made him
hopeful too. Few of us need to work, because

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:38.680
the modern economy is so productive.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.249
But rather than seeing this need not to work
as the freedom it is, we complain about it

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:50.129
masochistically and describe it by a pejorative
word “unemployment.” We should call it freedom.

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:54.619
There’s so much unemployment for a good
and deeply admirable reason: because we’re

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:59.719
so good at making things efficiently. We’re
not all needed at the coal face.

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:04.589
But in that case, we should - thought Marx
- make leisure admirable. We should redistribute

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:08.939
the wealth of the massive corporations that
make so much surplus money and give it to

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:09.469
everyone.

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:15.119
This is, in its own way, as beautiful a dream
as Jesus’s promise of heaven; but a good

00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:17.469
deal more realistic sounding.

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:21.399
Capitalism is bad for capitalists

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:25.849
Marx did not think capitalists were evil.
For example, he was acutely aware of the sorrows

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:28.669
and secret agonies that lay behind bourgeois
marriage.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.979
Marx argued that marriage was actually an
extension of business, and that the bourgeois

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:38.509
family was fraught with tension, oppression,
and resentment, with people staying together

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:41.589
not for love but for financial reasons.

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:45.879
Marx believed that the capitalist system forces
everyone to put economic interests at the

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:50.789
heart of their lives, so that they can no
longer know deep, honest relationships. He

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:52.589
called this psychological tendency

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:56.149
commodity fetishism = Warenfetischismus

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:59.460
because it makes us value things that have
no objective value.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.240
He wanted people to be freed from financial
constraint so that they could - at last - start

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.129
to make sensible, healthy choices in their
relationships.

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:13.169
The 20th century feminist answer to the oppression
of women has been to argue that women should

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:18.210
be able to go out to work. Marx’s answer
was more subtle. This feminist insistence

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:23.020
merely perpetuates human slavery. The point
isn’t that women should imitate the sufferings

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.879
of their male colleagues,it’s that men and
women should have the permanent option to

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:29.779
enjoy leisure.

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.499
Why don’t we all think a bit more like marx?

00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:37.029
An important aspect of Marx’s work is that
he proposes that there is an insidious, subtle

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:42.249
way in which the economic system colours the
sort of ideas that we ending up having.

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:45.969
The economy generates what Marx termed an
“ideology”.

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:50.469
A capitalist society is one where most people,
rich and poor, believe all sorts of things

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:55.309
that are really just value judgements that
relate back to the economic system: that a

00:06:55.309 --> 00:07:00.699
person who doesn’t work is worthless, that
leisure (beyond a few weeks a year) is sinful,

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:04.999
that more belongings will make us happier
and that worthwhile things (and people) will

00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:06.839
invariably make money.

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:11.679
In short, one of the biggest evils of Capitalism
is not that there are corrupt people at the

00:07:11.679 --> 00:07:16.649
top—this is true in any human hierarchy—but
that capitalist ideas teach all of us to be

00:07:16.649 --> 00:07:21.409
anxious, competitive, conformist, and politically
complacent.

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:26.139
Marx didn’t only outline what was wrong
capitalism: we also get glimpses of what Marx

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:29.519
wanted the ideal utopian future to be like.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.820
In his Communist Manifesto he describes a world
without private property or inherited wealth,

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:39.479
with a steeply graduated income tax, centralised
control of the banking, communication, and

00:07:39.479 --> 00:07:45.020
transport industries, and free public education.
Marx also expected that communist society

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:49.640
would allow people to develop lots of different
sides of their natures:

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:54.260
“in communist society…it is possible for
me to do one thing today and another tomorrow,

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:58.679
to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon,
rear cattle in the evening, criticise after

00:07:58.679 --> 00:08:05.519
dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever
becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or critic.”

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:10.080
After Marx moved to London he was supported
by his friend and intellectual partner Friedrich

00:08:10.089 --> 00:08:15.279
Engels, a wealthy man whose father owned a
cotton plant in Manchester. Engels covered

00:08:15.279 --> 00:08:20.339
Marx’s debts and made sure his works were
published. Capitalism paid for Communism.

00:08:20.339 --> 00:08:23.799
The two men even wrote each other adoring
poetry.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.580
Marx was not a well-regarded or popular intellectual
in his day.

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.819
Respectable, conventional people of Marx’s

00:08:29.819 --> 00:08:34.630
day would have laughed at the idea that his
ideas could remake the world. Yet just a few

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:38.520
decades later they did: his writings became
the keystone for some of the most important

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.500
ideological movements of the 20th century.

00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:45.600
But Marx was like a brilliant doctor in the
early days of medicine. He could recognise

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:50.040
the nature of the disease, although he had
no idea how to go about curing it.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:54.209
At this point in history, we should all be
Marxists in the sense of agreeing with his

00:08:54.209 --> 00:08:58.930
diagnosis of our troubles. But we need to
go out and find the cures that will really

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:03.079
work. As Marx himself declared, and we deeply
agree:

00:09:03.079 --> 00:09:06.009
Philosophers until now have only interpreted

00:09:06.009 --> 00:09:11.709
the world in various ways. The point, however,
is to change it.
