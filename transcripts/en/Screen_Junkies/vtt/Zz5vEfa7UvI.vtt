00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.040
From the director who just wants to watch
the world go boom

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.719
and the studio that enables him

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:17.160
comes the dumbest, most incoherent Transformers
movie yet...

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.230
which is really saying something.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.869
Did he just...punch a guy with a car?

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.689
Transformers: Age Of Extinction.

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.649
Prepare for a total reinvention of the franchise,
with an all new cast,

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:33.530
all new villains,

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.860
and cool new allies

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.280
only to end up with the same overlong piece
of sh*t where once again we have no

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.240
idea

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:45.280
what's

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.020
happening.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.710
"Oh my god!"

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.420
Hey, if Michael Bay can reuse shots, we can
reuse Transformers jokes.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:03.280
Shia Laboeuf is gone, and neither you nor
Bumblebee nor Optimus Prime will care where

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.409
he went.

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.870
Instead, settle in with Boston-native Texan
Kade Yeager.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.530
A man fighting against all odds to sound intelligent.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.330
"That is a super simplex theater projector.
It's very rare."

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.160
"who taught you how to solder a circuit? Me,
that's what I do!"

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.540
Oh, and he's also an inventor.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.110
"I know you have a conscience because you're
an inventor like me."

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.450
"I'm so gonna patent this sh*t!"

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.000
"Some things should never be invented."

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.110
"That's what great inventors do."

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.030
"I'm an inventor! This could be a game-changer
for me! If I could apply that technology to

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.640
my inventions, we'd never have to worry about
money again!"

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.150
You're an inventor. We get it.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.330
In a franchise that's known for objectifying
hot young women,

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.590
prepare for a new low

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.280
as they make the movie's hot chick an underage
girl,

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.850
"Sweetheart, your shorts are shrinking by
the second."

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.690
make her boyfriend a legal adult, and literally
stop the movie to explain why it's okay for

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:51.650
them to pork.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.870
"You're a 17 year old girl. How old are you?"

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:55.190
"20."

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.150
"She's a minor."

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.260
"We're protected by the Romeo and Juliet laws."

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
"We dated for a little while I was a sophomore
and he was a senior. It's fine."

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.300
"No, it's not fine."

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.250
"We've got a preexisting juvenile foundational
relationship. Statute two-seven-zero-five

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.930
dash three."

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.910
If only they'd put as much time into justifying
the plot as they

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.920
did for having sex with a minor.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.590
The Transformers are back, and they're as
over these movies as we are.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.900
"This is isn't our fight! Let's go!"

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.700
"See ya. Goodbye."

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.560
Especially Optimus Prime.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.140
"We're done defending the humans."

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.410
"Autobots, we're done."

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.970
Watch as they bumble their way through another
Michael Bay crapfest so lazily produced he

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.310
didn't bother to fix these green screen
monitors,

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.690
has scenes go from day to night to day again,

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.500
and left the Sears Tower up in the background

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.450
of HONG KONG.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.780
So get ready for another sequel that you hoped
would be better, but instead shoved the exact

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.150
same thing down our gullible throats,

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.640
featuring even more

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.700
Unrealistic explosions

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.300
going off around unfunny comic relief

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.850
during a neverending sunset

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.040
near an American flag.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.240
Hey guys? Why is the rest of this trailer
written in Chinese?

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.360
Hey!
