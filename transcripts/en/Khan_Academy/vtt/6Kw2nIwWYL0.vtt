00:00:00.148 --> 00:00:02.091
Voiceover:We have two vectors here.

00:00:02.091 --> 00:00:04.268
Vector A, it has a magnitude of three

00:00:04.268 --> 00:00:06.106
so the length of this blue arrow is three.

00:00:06.106 --> 00:00:09.629
Its direction, it forms a 33
degree angle with the positive,

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:11.646
I guess you could say the positive x axis.

00:00:11.646 --> 00:00:13.518
I haven't drawn that here

00:00:13.518 --> 00:00:16.253
and vector B has a magnitude of two,

00:00:16.253 --> 00:00:17.629
the length of this arrow is two

00:00:17.629 --> 00:00:20.807
and it forms a 135 degree
angle with a positive x axis.

00:00:20.807 --> 00:00:22.588
What I want to think about in this video

00:00:22.588 --> 00:00:25.819
and maybe the next one depends
on how we do with the time

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:29.328
is what is the magnitude
and direction of the sum

00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:31.237
of these two vectors.

00:00:31.237 --> 00:00:34.942
What is the magnitude and
direction of the vector A plus B?

00:00:34.942 --> 00:00:36.222
I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:36.222 --> 00:00:37.770
and try to work this through on your own

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.360
before I work through it.

00:00:40.467 --> 00:00:41.696
Well to think about this,

00:00:41.696 --> 00:00:43.586
I'm going to decompose
each of these vectors

00:00:43.586 --> 00:00:46.151
into their horizontal and
their vertical components.

00:00:46.151 --> 00:00:48.247
For example vector A could be viewed

00:00:48.247 --> 00:00:52.386
as the sum of this
horizontal pointing vector

00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:56.993
plus this vertical pointing vector.

00:00:56.993 --> 00:00:59.358
Another way of thinking
about this horizontal vector,

00:00:59.358 --> 00:01:00.233
this right over here,

00:01:00.233 --> 00:01:01.673
this is going to be a scaled up version

00:01:01.673 --> 00:01:04.110
of the unit vector I

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.447
and so this is going
to be something times I

00:01:09.447 --> 00:01:12.280
and this vector right over
here is going to be something

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.107
times the unit vector in
the vertical direction.

00:01:15.107 --> 00:01:22.773
The vertical direction might
look something like that

00:01:22.773 --> 00:01:25.211
or let's see if this is
three then the unit vector,

00:01:25.211 --> 00:01:28.046
yeah, actually would
look something like that.

00:01:28.046 --> 00:01:30.008
That's what the J unit vector looks like

00:01:30.008 --> 00:01:35.947
and this is what the I unit
vector would look like.

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:39.778
This is a scaled up version of it.

00:01:39.778 --> 00:01:44.006
It's something times I and
this is something times J.

00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:48.539
The same exact argument right over here.

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:51.680
This is going to be something
times the I unit vector,

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.943
its horizontal component

00:01:52.943 --> 00:01:55.442
and its vertical component
is going to be something

00:01:55.442 --> 00:01:57.889
times the J unit vector.

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:59.400
What we really need to do

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.038
is figure out the magnitudes
of these horizontal

00:02:02.038 --> 00:02:03.297
and vertical components

00:02:03.297 --> 00:02:05.014
and then we know how much to scale up I

00:02:05.014 --> 00:02:07.031
and how much to scale up J.

00:02:07.031 --> 00:02:09.363
Let's think through this a little bit.

00:02:09.363 --> 00:02:11.134
This one might jump out at you immediately

00:02:11.134 --> 00:02:13.582
is this is a 30, 60, 90 triangle.

00:02:13.582 --> 00:02:17.704
This is a 30, 60, 90 triangle
then this side right over here

00:02:17.704 --> 00:02:21.708
is going to be half the
length of the hypotenuse.

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:25.743
This is going to be half of three,

00:02:25.743 --> 00:02:28.946
so it's three over two and
this one right over here,

00:02:28.946 --> 00:02:30.603
let me do that in same color.

00:02:30.603 --> 00:02:34.500
This is going to be three,
that's not the same,

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.516
that's a different color.

00:02:35.516 --> 00:02:38.639
This is going to be three over two

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:40.815
and then this length right over here.

00:02:40.815 --> 00:02:42.580
This is going to be square root of three

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.982
times the shorter side.

00:02:43.982 --> 00:02:48.793
This is three times the
square root of three over two.

00:02:48.793 --> 00:02:50.687
I just took this and multiplied
it by the square root of three

00:02:50.687 --> 00:02:54.907
and once again that just came
out of 30, 60, 90 triangles.

00:02:54.907 --> 00:02:57.356
Now another way that you could tackle this

00:02:57.356 --> 00:02:59.453
is to use your, what would you know

00:02:59.453 --> 00:03:00.658
about your trig functions?

00:03:00.658 --> 00:03:02.506
You say, "Okay I know
this angle right here"

00:03:02.506 --> 00:03:05.573
"is a 30 degree angle,
this is the opposite side."

00:03:05.573 --> 00:03:08.837
You could say, "Well,
the opposite over three"

00:03:08.837 --> 00:03:11.824
"is going to be equal to
the sine of 30 degrees,"

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:13.057
let me right this down.

00:03:13.057 --> 00:03:16.343
Soh cah toa.

00:03:16.343 --> 00:03:24.245
Sine of 30 degrees is going to
be equal to the opposite side

00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:26.601
over the length of the hypotenuse.

00:03:26.601 --> 00:03:30.705
Over three or we could
say that the opposite side

00:03:30.705 --> 00:03:41.757
is equal to three times
the sine of 30 degrees.

00:03:41.757 --> 00:03:43.664
If you put this in your calculator,

00:03:43.664 --> 00:03:46.255
sine of 30 degrees is one half

00:03:46.255 --> 00:03:48.628
and so you're going to
get three halves here.

00:03:48.628 --> 00:03:50.585
Similarly for this side,

00:03:50.585 --> 00:03:53.636
this side is adjacent
to the 30 degree angle.

00:03:53.636 --> 00:03:58.150
You could say cosine, cosine
is adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.354
You could say that cosine of 30 degrees

00:04:02.354 --> 00:04:06.088
is equal to adjacent over the hypotenuse

00:04:06.088 --> 00:04:09.157
or multiplying both sides by three.

00:04:09.157 --> 00:04:14.935
The adjacent is going to be equal to three

00:04:14.935 --> 00:04:19.224
times the cosine of 30 degrees

00:04:19.224 --> 00:04:22.242
and the cosine of 30 degrees
if you type in your calculator,

00:04:22.242 --> 00:04:23.845
you're actually going to
get some type of a decimal

00:04:23.845 --> 00:04:26.551
but it's square root of three over two.

00:04:26.551 --> 00:04:28.469
Three square root of three over two

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:31.607
and you can verify this if you like.

00:04:31.607 --> 00:04:37.897
We see here, sine of 30 is indeed one half

00:04:37.897 --> 00:04:40.047
and cosine of 30

00:04:40.047 --> 00:04:42.271
well you get this kind of crazy decimal

00:04:42.271 --> 00:04:43.999
but notice that is the same thing

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:47.751
as square root of three divided by two.

00:04:47.751 --> 00:04:50.037
The exact same value right over here

00:04:50.037 --> 00:04:51.190
but we were able to figure that out

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.582
just using what we know
about 30, 60, 90 triangles.

00:04:53.582 --> 00:04:56.758
Now this triangle, you might
say, "Well, what's the angle?"

00:04:56.758 --> 00:04:58.134
What angles do we know about it?

00:04:58.134 --> 00:05:02.865
Well this angle right over here

00:05:02.865 --> 00:05:06.502
is this is supplementary
to this 135 degree angle.

00:05:06.502 --> 00:05:08.287
This is a 45 degree angle.

00:05:08.287 --> 00:05:10.466
This is 90 so this is 45.

00:05:10.466 --> 00:05:14.361
This is a 45, 45, 90 degree triangle.

00:05:14.361 --> 00:05:18.418
Now you could say that
using the trig identities

00:05:18.418 --> 00:05:22.063
and what we did right
over here that this length

00:05:22.063 --> 00:05:24.199
is going to be the hypotenuse

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:30.689
times the cosine of 45 degrees

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:32.653
and you could say that
this length right over here

00:05:32.653 --> 00:05:40.177
is going to be the hypotenuse
times the sine of 45 degrees.

00:05:40.177 --> 00:05:41.968
Using the exact same logic here

00:05:41.968 --> 00:05:44.327
and as you get more practice
with finding the components,

00:05:44.327 --> 00:05:45.939
you'll realize, okay,
you take the hypotenuse

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:48.231
times the cosine of this angle.

00:05:48.231 --> 00:05:51.084
You're going to get the adjacent side.

00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:54.079
If you do the hypotenuse
times the sine of this angle,

00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:55.806
you're going to get the opposite side

00:05:55.806 --> 00:05:58.416
but we could use this sine of 45 degrees.

00:05:58.416 --> 00:06:00.118
Once again if you put in your calculator,

00:06:00.118 --> 00:06:01.269
you get a crazy decimal

00:06:01.269 --> 00:06:04.770
but we can figure that out,
we know 45, 45, 90 triangles.

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.801
Sine of 45 degrees is
square root of two over two.

00:06:08.801 --> 00:06:12.149
Cosine of 45 degrees is also
square root of two over two.

00:06:12.149 --> 00:06:15.726
I know my writing is
getting a little bit messy

00:06:15.726 --> 00:06:17.592
and actually I should have
done all of these in green,

00:06:17.592 --> 00:06:19.870
square root of two over two.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.884
What's the length of that green vector?

00:06:22.884 --> 00:06:24.917
What's two times square
root of two over two,

00:06:24.917 --> 00:06:26.431
that's going to be square root of two.

00:06:26.431 --> 00:06:29.444
What's the length of this orange vector?

00:06:29.444 --> 00:06:31.055
It's two times square root of two over two

00:06:31.055 --> 00:06:32.575
so it's going to be square root of two.

00:06:32.575 --> 00:06:35.293
Now we know the magnitudes
of the component vector

00:06:35.293 --> 00:06:37.713
is a horizontal and vertical
components of each of these

00:06:37.713 --> 00:06:40.674
so now we can write these out as the sum

00:06:40.674 --> 00:06:42.769
of these horizontal and vertical vectors.

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:49.825
Vector A, we can write
as square root of three

00:06:49.825 --> 00:06:54.387
or three square roots of
three over two times I.

00:06:54.387 --> 00:06:56.431
That's this vector right over here,

00:06:56.431 --> 00:06:58.149
we scaled up the I unit vector

00:06:58.149 --> 00:06:59.865
by three squares root of three over two

00:06:59.865 --> 00:07:04.826
plus three halves times J.

00:07:04.826 --> 00:07:10.206
This right over here is
this vector right over here.

00:07:10.206 --> 00:07:12.608
Scaled up version of the J unit vector

00:07:12.608 --> 00:07:15.101
and if you add this orange
vector to this green vector,

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:16.794
you get vector A.

00:07:16.794 --> 00:07:23.758
Similarly, vector B is equal to the length

00:07:23.758 --> 00:07:25.036
of the horizontal component

00:07:25.036 --> 00:07:26.448
and we got to be very careful.

00:07:26.448 --> 00:07:28.167
It's length is square root of two

00:07:28.167 --> 00:07:30.956
but it's going in the leftward direction.

00:07:30.956 --> 00:07:35.158
We're going to put a
negative on it times I.

00:07:35.158 --> 00:07:37.733
If we just squared it, I is
doing something like this,

00:07:37.733 --> 00:07:39.919
square root of two times
I would look like that.

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:44.732
Negative square root of two
would point it to the left.

00:07:44.732 --> 00:07:47.621
This is negative square
root of two times I

00:07:47.621 --> 00:07:48.962
and then we're going to have

00:07:48.962 --> 00:07:54.712
plus square root of two times J.

00:07:54.712 --> 00:07:57.645
Now that we've broken them
up in their components,

00:07:57.645 --> 00:07:59.876
we're ready to figure out what,

00:07:59.876 --> 00:08:01.577
at least broken up into its components

00:08:01.577 --> 00:08:03.412
what A plus B is.

00:08:03.412 --> 00:08:12.969
A plus B is equal to, well
it's going to be the sum

00:08:12.969 --> 00:08:14.266
of all of these things.

00:08:14.266 --> 00:08:15.696
Let me just write that down.

00:08:15.696 --> 00:08:19.757
It's going to be that, copy and paste.

00:08:19.757 --> 00:08:27.958
That plus this, let me
just copy and paste it

00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.173
and you're going to get that

00:08:30.173 --> 00:08:31.780
but of course we can simplify this.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:35.281
We can add the I unit
vectors to each other.

00:08:35.281 --> 00:08:36.947
If I have three times
the square root of three

00:08:36.947 --> 00:08:38.862
over two Is and then I have another

00:08:38.862 --> 00:08:40.142
negative square root of two I,

00:08:40.142 --> 00:08:41.715
I can add that together.

00:08:41.715 --> 00:08:44.640
This is going to be equal to three

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.980
times the square root of three over two

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:50.525
minus square root of two times I

00:08:50.525 --> 00:08:53.296
and then I can add this to this

00:08:53.296 --> 00:08:56.229
and I'm going to get plus three halves

00:08:56.229 --> 00:08:59.938
plus square root of two times J.

00:08:59.938 --> 00:09:01.798
It looks a little bit complicated

00:09:01.798 --> 00:09:03.203
but we could type it in to our calculator

00:09:03.203 --> 00:09:06.272
and get approximations of
each of these two values

00:09:06.272 --> 00:09:10.517
and we essentially have
a at least a broken down

00:09:10.517 --> 00:09:12.995
into its components
representation of A plus B.

00:09:12.995 --> 00:09:15.819
In the next video, we're
now going to take this

00:09:15.819 --> 00:09:18.536
and figure out the actual
magnitude and direction

00:09:18.536 --> 00:09:20.498
of A plus B.
