her face I know that they were astral
 

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
her face I know that they were astral
projection<00:19:28.790><c> so</c><00:19:29.060><c> like</c><00:19:29.270><c> they</c><00:19:29.420><c> were</c><00:19:29.480><c> gonna</c><00:19:29.750><c> look</c>

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:29.930 align:start position:0%
projection so like they were gonna look
 

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:31.810 align:start position:0%
projection so like they were gonna look
weird<00:19:30.140><c> anyway</c><00:19:30.590><c> but</c><00:19:31.070><c> for</c><00:19:31.250><c> some</c><00:19:31.400><c> reason</c><00:19:31.760><c> it</c>

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:31.820 align:start position:0%
weird anyway but for some reason it
 

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:33.550 align:start position:0%
weird anyway but for some reason it
looks<00:19:31.910><c> like</c><00:19:32.150><c> they</c><00:19:32.360><c> took</c><00:19:32.570><c> her</c><00:19:32.750><c> mouth</c><00:19:32.960><c> off</c><00:19:33.200><c> and</c>

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:33.560 align:start position:0%
looks like they took her mouth off and
 

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:34.450 align:start position:0%
looks like they took her mouth off and
then<00:19:33.680><c> put</c><00:19:33.830><c> another</c><00:19:33.860><c> one</c><00:19:34.250><c> on</c>

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:34.460 align:start position:0%
then put another one on
 

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:36.340 align:start position:0%
then put another one on
but<00:19:34.730><c> it</c><00:19:34.820><c> was</c><00:19:35.000><c> her</c><00:19:35.240><c> mouth</c><00:19:35.510><c> if</c><00:19:35.780><c> they</c><00:19:35.960><c> did</c><00:19:36.110><c> some</c>

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:36.350 align:start position:0%
but it was her mouth if they did some
 

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
but it was her mouth if they did some
weird<00:19:36.500><c> pry</c><00:19:36.740><c> and</c><00:19:37.130><c> her</c><00:19:37.280><c> face</c><00:19:37.670><c> looked</c><00:19:37.970><c> weird</c>

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:38.570 align:start position:0%
weird pry and her face looked weird
 

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:42.430 align:start position:0%
weird pry and her face looked weird
yeah<00:19:39.820><c> action</c><00:19:40.820><c> effect</c><00:19:41.090><c> it</c><00:19:41.240><c> looked</c><00:19:41.510><c> like</c><00:19:41.780><c> they</c><00:19:42.050><c> I</c>

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:42.440 align:start position:0%
yeah action effect it looked like they I
 

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.290 align:start position:0%
yeah action effect it looked like they I
mean<00:19:42.830><c> they</c><00:19:42.920><c> obviously</c><00:19:43.040><c> like</c><00:19:43.580><c> turn</c><00:19:44.060><c> down</c><00:19:44.210><c> the</c>

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:44.300 align:start position:0%
mean they obviously like turn down the
 

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.660 align:start position:0%
mean they obviously like turn down the
opacity<00:19:44.740><c> and</c><00:19:45.740><c> then</c><00:19:45.980><c> it</c><00:19:46.160><c> looked</c><00:19:46.370><c> like</c><00:19:46.520><c> they</c>

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:46.670 align:start position:0%
opacity and then it looked like they
 

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:48.460 align:start position:0%
opacity and then it looked like they
added<00:19:47.030><c> like</c><00:19:47.150><c> some</c><00:19:47.330><c> CG</c><00:19:47.660><c> elements</c><00:19:48.050><c> or</c><00:19:48.140><c> something</c>

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:48.470 align:start position:0%
added like some CG elements or something
 

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:52.270 align:start position:0%
added like some CG elements or something
on<00:19:48.590><c> it</c><00:19:48.770><c> there</c><00:19:49.010><c> it</c><00:19:49.220><c> was</c><00:19:50.470><c> yeah</c><00:19:51.470><c> but</c><00:19:51.980><c> I</c><00:19:52.010><c> was</c><00:19:52.160><c> like</c>
