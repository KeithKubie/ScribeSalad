FEMALE SPEAKER: Welcome.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.900
Welcome to today's talk.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.872
I'm Rachel Amara.

00:00:05.872 --> 00:00:07.830
I'm actually based in
our San Francisco office,

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.482
but I like to have good excuses
to come down to Mountain View

00:00:10.482 --> 00:00:11.940
every now and then
and host authors

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.430
here or in San Francisco.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.450
So today I'm really excited to
host Jonathan Robinson, whose

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.870
joining us here from
the world of the Bay

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.490
Area in northern California.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.690
Jonathan is here to talk
today about his book

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.240
"Find Happiness
Now," and he's got

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.790
a great hour planned for
us, which includes things

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.650
like music and sound effects
and magic tricks and all kinds

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.380
of tips on what we
really need and need

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.850
to find to be happy now.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.850
So just a quick
update on Jonathan--

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.350
so Jonathan's written
over 10 books.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.770
So he is only talking
about, really, one here,

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.100
but there's another book here
called "Life's Big Questions"

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.650
that some of you have
gotten, and there

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.350
is additional books
in his repertoire.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.150
They've been translated in
over 47 languages total,

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:08.490
and he has been-- over 250
million people have reached

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.500
and have been
through the programs,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.720
whether he's been
seen on Oprah or CNN

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.430
or reading books or things
like this Google Talk.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.930
So please welcome
Jonathan Robinson.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.763
Join me to welcome him.

00:01:19.763 --> 00:01:23.470
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.440
JONATHAN ROBINSON: Thank
you for coming today.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.750
I'm going to begin with
a provocative question,

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.260
and that is if you
could download something

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.950
on your smartphone, an
app that could stimulate

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.830
your brain to feelings
of ecstasy and happiness,

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.050
would you plug into
that technology?

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.080
How many people would-- yeah?

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.519
How many people would not?

00:01:44.519 --> 00:01:46.810
And how many people will not
raise their hand no matter

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.200
what I ask.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.700
A couple.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.830
Yeah, OK, great.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.680
We may be in a position
where we actually

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.300
have to make decisions
like that soon

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.030
because the future
technology of happiness

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.860
is happening very
quickly, and I'm

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.210
going to give you a tour of what
some of those technologies are.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.770
But before I go into
what the future is,

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.020
I want to talk about how
to find happiness now,

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.200
and all you need is what's
the magical substance

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.090
between your own ears, OK?

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.650
So we may have
different terms for it,

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.760
but I think everything that we
are doing is to be happier now

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.450
or in the future,
whether you are trying

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.810
to get a lot of money
so you can be happy

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.410
or a relationship
so you can be happy.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.492
That is what we're basically
doing all the time.

00:02:35.492 --> 00:02:37.200
Now you may have a
different name for it.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.070
You might call it peace of
mind or contentment or life

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.120
satisfaction.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.440
But the reason you
came to work today

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.470
is because you think
that by doing that,

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.294
it's going to make you
happier in the future.

00:02:51.294 --> 00:02:52.710
I'll remind you,
if you have kids,

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.550
the reason you had kids is
because you think someday they

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.880
will help make you happier
in the future, right?

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.550
So that's what
we're always doing,

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.970
but I have good
news and bad news.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.590
And the bad news is
that we're really not

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.430
very good at this skill.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.980
In the last 100 years,
our ability to be happy

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.890
has not gone up at all and
yet the level of depression

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.900
has risen by a factor of
10 in the last 60 years.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.690
Right now, 10% of Americans
are clinically depressed.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.130
So it's an important
skill to learn

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.963
since that's what we're
always trying to do.

00:03:32.963 --> 00:03:36.100
Whatever your method is, whether
it be money or relationships

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.660
or meditation or
yoga, you're always

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.880
trying to get to this
magical state of contentment,

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.027
and we really are bad at it.

00:03:44.027 --> 00:03:45.610
So there's a lot
room for improvement,

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.270
and I think that's good news.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.180
And part of the
good news is knowing

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.336
that it is a learnable
skill, but technology

00:03:55.336 --> 00:03:56.460
doesn't seem to be helping.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.760
So we have to ask ourselves,
is technology helping us?

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.450
We think technology is here
to make our lives better.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.130
And in fact, I am very grateful
to Google and my smartphone

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.060
and everything else.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.260
But for a lot of people,
the technology actually

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.144
ends up being WMDs-- not
weapons of mass destruction,

00:04:16.144 --> 00:04:19.959
but widgets of mass distraction.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.210
The average person watches four
and a half hours of TV a day.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.710
I watch almost none, which
means that some guy in Iowa

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.780
has to watch nine hours
to make up for me.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.260
Sometimes I turn on the TV
so that guy can step outside

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.780
for a few minutes, you know?

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.170
So we have to learn
how to use technology

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.800
since we're surrounded
by it to actually boost

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.590
our level of happiness
rather than boost

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.110
our level of distraction,
and that is a skill as well.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.280
So we are taught in
the American cult-ure--

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:59.010
the American cult-ure-- that
success leads to happiness.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.330
Does Donald Trump look
that happy to you?

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.550
If success led to happiness,
he would be a pretty happy guy,

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:05.590
right?

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:06.809
He does not look that happy.

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:07.350
I've met him.

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.290
He's not.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:14.310
But the opposite is true--
happiness does lead to success.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.000
Happy people make $750,000 more
over the course of their life

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.560
than unhappy people.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.570
They live nine years longer.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.360
There's no pill you can
take that will help you live

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.950
nine years longer, but
happiness actually can do that.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.350
Happy people raise happier kids.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.250
They take fewer sick days.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.590
Corporations pay me to
talk about happiness

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.010
because it helps their bottom
line in that people become

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.640
more productive.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.360
They also take fewer sick days.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.400
So there's a lot of
benefits to being happy,

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.910
and it's not
something that is just

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.590
a feel good thing that
makes you more selfish.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.410
In fact, happy people are more
giving than unhappy people.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.180
So it's very important that
people learn this skill

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.000
and learn healthy
ways of doing it

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.860
so that everybody
benefits from it.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:11.960
Now the first key in terms
of the skill of happiness

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.820
is being able to know what your
target is, having it defined,

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.170
because people define
happiness very differently.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:24.910
For some people, it is a life of
total serenity and relaxation.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.210
For other people, it's total
adrenaline and facing fears

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.140
and going for an adventure.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.950
Those are very
different things, so you

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:36.790
want to know what your specific
target is because that will

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.940
give you a better chance
of hitting that target.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.140
I learned the importance
of knowing your target

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.820
when I was a
freshman in college.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.130
My roommate was one of the
best basketball players in LA,

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.820
and he challenged me to
a game of basketball.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.040
We put some money on it.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.900
And I said, I'll play you
a game on one condition--

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.850
I can bring out any 1-ounce
gadget onto the court

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.900
and place it wherever I want.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:00.730
He said, OK.

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.250
He knew he'd beat me.

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:04.424
So I brought out
this 1-ounce gadget.

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:06.340
Looked a little bit like
this. and I placed it

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.105
in a strategic location,
namely over his eyes.

00:07:10.105 --> 00:07:11.750
And I said, let the games begin.

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.750
Now admittedly, it was
still pretty close,

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.980
but I beat one of the best
basketball players in LA

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.270
because I knew exactly
what I was aiming for.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:24.440
The fact that I had
total lack of skill

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.460
was not as important as
knowing where the target was.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.030
So you don't want to climb
the ladder success only

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.470
to find it's against
the wrong wall.

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:36.550
What is happiness to you?

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:38.580
What does it look like?

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.740
Because if you don't define it,
your parents' vision of it will

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:46.560
define it for you or the
American "cult"-ure will define

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.260
it for you.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.880
And American culture
says that happiness

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.370
equals a lot of money.

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:54.460
But people who are
rich are no happier

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.870
than people who are
middle class, so it's

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:59.370
good to define these things.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.990
A second key, which
you probably heard of,

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:04.510
is to practice gratitude.

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:05.970
Now we've all
heard that, but you

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:08.630
need a really good,
simple technique.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.590
So in the '90s, I
interviewed a lot

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:15.247
of well known spiritual
leaders for a book I was doing.

00:08:15.247 --> 00:08:17.580
I interviewed everybody from
Mother Teresa-- late Mother

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.920
Teresa-- to Dalai
Lama and Deepak Chopra

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.480
and Wayne Dyer and
all those people.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.560
And I was asking
them for their best

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.480
method for finding
happiness and for finding

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.470
a spiritual connection.

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:30.310
And I was amazed
at how many of them

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:33.549
said that gratitude was a key.

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:37.270
So a few years later when I'd
heard of an Indian guru who

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:41.330
supposedly had this magical
mantra for helping people

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.740
experience
overwhelming gratitude,

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.880
I wanted to know
what that mantra was.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:51.030
So I travelled 18,000 miles
to India to talk to this guy.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:52.690
And if you've ever
been to India,

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.090
it is not an easy
place to travel to.

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:58.330
And then when I got there, going
on a rickshaw for three hours.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:00.950
Then I get to the
ashram and I have

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:04.120
to wait in line four
hours to talk to the guru.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.300
Finally I get to him
and I say, guru, gee,

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.040
I came all the way from America
to learn your magical mantra

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.520
to feel overwhelming gratitude.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.710
Please tell me.

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:16.130
So he says-- his
deep Indian accent--

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:20.330
ah yes, my mantra is the most
powerful mantra on Earth.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.350
Said, normally I don't
say it so quickly,

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.040
but you travel all
the way from America.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.400
I will tell you the mantra.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.250
I'm very excited.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:29.130
And he leans in to
whisper into my ear

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:33.670
and he says, whenever possible,
repeat the following words.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:41.820
The mantra I give you are
the words "thank you."

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.750
I go, that's it?

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.690
Thank you?

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:48.690
I travel 18,000 miles
for thank-- that's it?

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:52.330
He says, no, "that's it" is
a mantra you had been using.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:54.490
That makes you feel like
you never have enough.

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:57.804
My mantra is "thank you,"
not "that's it." "That's it"

00:09:57.804 --> 00:09:58.720
will take you nowhere.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:07.180
Well, I was disappointed
and pretty pissed off,

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:10.750
but I figure I'd traveled so
far I would do what he said,

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:12.560
so I told them thank you.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.040
He said, no, you
can't say thank you.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:19.170
You have to say thank you from
your heart many times a day

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:22.460
for each of the
life's blessings.

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:23.070
So I tried.

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:24.630
I said thank you,
and I left there.

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:27.082
And I took a taxi, and
as I'm entering the taxi,

00:10:27.082 --> 00:10:28.840
I noticed it has
air conditioning.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.280
It's about 105 degrees in India.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:35.510
I said, oh, well, thank you
for the air conditioning.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.850
And then I leave the taxi and
I put my hand in my pocket.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:40.270
I have money.

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:42.200
Thank you for my money.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.190
Then I go to the hotel room, and
there's a bottle of clean water

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:46.020
there.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.260
Thank you for the clean water.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.520
And then there's a
nice toilet there.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.460
In India, good toilets
can be hard to find.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.190
Thank you for the toilet.

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:57.182
And then there was air
conditioning in the room

00:10:57.182 --> 00:10:58.140
and there was a shower.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.970
I took a shower.

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:02.570
Thank you for the shower.

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:07.860
And in this hotel, there
was actually Wi-Fi in India.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.470
I was very thankful for that.

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:11.930
Get on the computer, Google.

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:14.102
Thank you for Google.

00:11:14.102 --> 00:11:17.480
Oh, I feel that
many times a day.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.140
And then on and on it went.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:24.670
And within about an hour, I had
tears of gratitude going down

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:29.920
my face because we live
better than billionaires

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.370
lived 20 years ago.

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:34.300
We have access to all
the world's information

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:35.660
in our phone.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.800
We can talk to anyone in
the world from anywhere

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.120
in the world.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.700
We-- for god's sakes, we have
Ben and Jerry's and Haagen Dazs

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.870
ice cream never more
than two miles away.

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:48.370
Life is good, right?

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:50.740
But if you don't
have a simple method

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:56.139
for feeling that gratitude,
it all goes by unnoticed.

00:11:56.139 --> 00:11:57.930
I mean, how many days
do we do that that we

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:01.670
have all these blessings
and they're invisible to us?

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:03.740
So a simple method
like saying thank you

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:06.380
from your heart for the
people in your life--

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.966
even the people that
cause you trouble.

00:12:08.966 --> 00:12:10.340
If it weren't for
jerks like you,

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:11.464
I wouldn't know compassion.

00:12:15.025 --> 00:12:15.524
Thank you.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:21.660
So a simple method like that can
help you tune into gratitude.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.610
And we're all so busy
nowadays that it's

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:27.360
nice to have methods that
don't require any extra time.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.460
You're already taking a shower.

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.470
You're already eating
Haagen Dazs ice cream.

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:35.310
You're already eating free food.

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:38.050
It just takes a moment
to feel those blessings.

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:39.620
So that's a second key.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:43.640
A third key is to learn
easy ways to be happy.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:46.320
A lot of people in my parents'
generation, their method

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.590
for being happy was
to work for 40 years,

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:52.410
get the kids out of
the house, retire,

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.795
and then they could have
a moment of happiness.

00:12:57.647 --> 00:12:59.230
Well, I'm not going
to wait that long.

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:01.330
I can barely wait a
minute and a half.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:05.760
So we have to find ways that you
can do in under a minute that

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.450
help you to feel really good.

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:11.570
My question is, does it pass
the beer and remote test?

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:13.820
People are watching four and
a half hours of TV a day.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:14.140
Why?

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.070
Because all you have to
do is move your thumb

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:19.350
a quarter of an inch and
you get 500 channels.

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:20.789
That's pretty good, right?

00:13:20.789 --> 00:13:23.330
Sometimes I don't want to move
my thumb a quarter of an inch,

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:27.190
but I'm willing to
to work that hard.

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:29.860
Or a beer-- immediately
feeling good,

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.920
tastes good, and
alters how you feel.

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.950
So we need methods
or technologies

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:37.820
for feeling good
that are that simple.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.780
And I have kind of
specialized in my book,

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:43.320
"Find Happiness Now," I talk
about 50 of those methods

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.520
because different people
need different methods.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.460
Different strokes
for different folks.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.730
I personally am a
Haagen Dazs person.

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:53.070
Other people are
Ben and Jerry's.

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:55.240
Everybody has different
tastes, so you

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.350
have to find what works for you.

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:00.590
So for me, I found that
very simple method--

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:04.020
say, for example, like singing.

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:07.840
It's hard to sing "Twist
and Shout" by the Beatles

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.330
and feel bad.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.020
Try it some time.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.140
Or acts of kindness.

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:17.210
Acts of kindness are one of the
quickest and most powerful ways

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:20.210
to boost your own
level of happiness.

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:22.930
Now people don't always
remember my lecture,

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:25.060
but they always remember
my magic tricks.

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:27.490
So I'm going to do
some magic tricks.

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:31.520
Hopefully, you'll get the
metaphor or analogy here.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.670
When we're born, let this
rope represent the wholeness

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:37.050
we have as a child.

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:40.390
The problem is as
we get older, we

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:43.230
can get cut off from
that sense of wholeness

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:46.530
and that sense of
joy that we once had.

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:50.230
See if I can cut through
this-- there we go.

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:55.110
And soon, we're left feeling
cut off from ourselves--

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:57.695
the life's daily stresses.

00:14:57.695 --> 00:14:59.070
Well, when that
happens, you have

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:01.200
to find a very
simple method that

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.110
will tie those
different parts of you

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:05.350
together so you can
feel whole again.

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:08.490
Now it feels like
a method at first,

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:12.040
but with repetition,
something magical happens.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:16.530
And what happens-- I'll use my
magic wand here-- what happens

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:20.150
is suddenly you feel restored to
that wholeness and completeness

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:22.777
and joy that you had as a child.

00:15:22.777 --> 00:15:23.610
AUDIENCE: Very good.

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:24.300
JONATHAN ROBINSON:
Well, thank you.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:25.466
You can applaud if you want.

00:15:25.466 --> 00:15:26.190
I'm OK with that.

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:29.544
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:29.544 --> 00:15:30.960
JONATHAN ROBINSON:
So in a moment,

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:35.810
I'm going to guide you on what
I call a two-minute meditation.

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:40.080
And in this meditation, I hope
to reduce your stress hormone

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.954
levels a cortisol for
the next five hours.

00:15:42.954 --> 00:15:44.620
According to the
Institute of HeartMath,

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:49.280
that is the power of this
next two-minute meditation.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:55.330
I also hope to help you discover
a way that you can be happier

00:15:55.330 --> 00:16:00.280
by you accessing your own
internal guidance, OK?

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:01.900
So that's a lot to
do in two minutes,

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:05.000
but I like to work quick so
hopefully that will work.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.250
Now to do this, one of the
things that you'll be doing

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:10.360
is focusing on a
person or animal

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.970
that you have great
affection for.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:14.530
This is my cute puppy, Sophie.

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:17.170
She's adorable.

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:18.760
Although I love
my wife very much,

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.260
I often focus on
Sophie because I

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:21.965
have no baggage at
all with Sophie.

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:29.400
But I want you to focus on a
person or animal or young child

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.600
that you have great
affection for.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:35.400
And right now, where you
are, you can close your eyes,

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:36.290
get comfortable.

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:37.570
This won't take very long.

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:40.170
I'll play some background music.

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:45.020
And we'll have you do a
guided meditation in which I

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:46.970
will guide you the whole way.

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:51.610
So close your eyes,
become relaxed.

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:54.160
And think of a person
or child or animal

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.910
that you have great
affection for.

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:04.099
And imagine them giving
you a look that reminds you

00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:05.575
how much you care about them.

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:11.569
If you can, remember special
times you had with this being.

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:20.270
And if you can, just
think of how glad you are

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:22.020
and how appreciative
you are that they're

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:22.999
a part of your life.

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.100
You can imagine holding
them or hugging them

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:32.820
if that helps you to
feel closer to them.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.030
And just think of
how lucky you are

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:46.750
and how grateful you are that
this being is part of your life

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:49.385
and how much you
really appreciate them.

00:17:49.385 --> 00:17:51.900
And you can even tell
them inside your head

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:53.800
and see how happy
that makes them.

00:17:58.219 --> 00:18:02.340
And breathe in that feeling
of care and gratitude

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:03.150
as best you can.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.057
And from this place
of a quieter mind,

00:18:09.057 --> 00:18:10.390
I'm going to ask you a question.

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:13.610
And just listen for any
answer that might feel right.

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:16.960
And the question is,
what do you need to know

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:23.132
or what do you need to do to
be even happier in your life?

00:18:23.132 --> 00:18:24.590
What do you need
to know or what do

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:28.450
you need to do to be even
happier in your life?

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:35.420
Take a few moments
to think about that.

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:42.590
What else can you do to
be happier in your life?

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:52.380
And when you're ready, you
can come back to the room.

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:58.810
Slowly come back.

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:01.806
That took about two minutes.

00:19:01.806 --> 00:19:03.430
Looks like some you
went out and smoked

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:05.110
a joint during that time.

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:10.210
You have that red-eye
look a little bit.

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:13.270
That's the power of two
minutes where you're actually

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:16.640
affecting your blood
chemistry radically

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.450
for the next few hours through
a simple method like that.

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:23.800
And if we asked ourselves
what I call power questions--

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.960
questions that help us get
in touch with what we need

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:30.650
to know, like what do you
need to know to be happier

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:34.040
or who do I love
and who loves me.

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:39.270
These are simple ways to guide
our mind in a helpful way

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:40.890
because the mind--
the human mind

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:45.730
is like Velcro for
negativity and we

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:48.670
need it to be more like Teflon.

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:52.750
So these simple methods,
and many others in my book

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:55.840
or that you can get
online or anywhere,

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:59.640
can teach you how to access
the joy and happiness

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.250
that we had a lot as kids.

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:05.180
I know a group of people who
are really happy almost all

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.690
the time.

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:09.035
Unfortunately, most of them
are under the age of five.

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:14.880
So we don't have to learn
how to be happy so much

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:20.380
as to let go of our negative
habits of holding on to worries

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:24.500
and problems and
things like that.

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.650
A fifth key to being
happy is the ability

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:29.900
to invest in relationships.

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.640
The number one correlation
to human happiness

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:36.830
is the quality and quantity
of your relationships.

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:40.520
Not only that, the ability
to be kind, the ability

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.700
to connect with people.

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.300
In fact, I'll give
you an opportunity

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:46.960
now to be kind if you want.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.620
I'm looking for
somebody who would

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:54.140
be willing to give me $5
or $10 on the condition

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:57.360
that you will not
be getting it back.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.190
Anybody at all?

00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:59.540
Anybody who's kind?

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.415
Just if you have $5
or $10 and you're

00:21:01.415 --> 00:21:04.150
willing going to give it
to me, just take it out

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:05.970
and I will collect it.

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:07.520
A guy has to make
a living, you know?

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:14.332
This man here looks
like he has something.

00:21:14.332 --> 00:21:15.150
Oh, OK.

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:15.840
Great.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:16.820
Oh, thank you.

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:18.889
He beat you to it.

00:21:18.889 --> 00:21:19.680
Thank you for that.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.610
AUDIENCE: [GROANING]

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:22.630
JONATHAN ROBINSON:
Yeah, well, I find

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:27.630
that people who are willing to
be the first to give themselves

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:30.640
usually get back a lot
more than they give.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:34.270
In fact, what I have
found is that people

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:38.460
who are willing to
take that risk usually

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:40.630
do rather well in life.

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:52.930
In this case, they get
back 10 times the amount.

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:56.150
And you may keep that for being
willing to take that risk.

00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:57.420
Let's give this man a hand.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:01.164
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:03.624 --> 00:22:06.290
JONATHAN ROBINSON: Usually I get
a better response a second time

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:06.956
I ask for money.

00:22:06.956 --> 00:22:08.450
I don't know why that is.

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:15.980
Really, we are hesitant to take
that initial emotional risk,

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:19.480
but people who are willing to
do that make those connections.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:23.480
Intimacy is one of
the keys to happiness,

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.840
but we're not
taught how to do it.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:29.225
Luckily, the instructions are
in the word-- in-to-me-see.

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:37.110
Vulnerability and
human kindness are

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:40.350
one of the most sought
after things in the world

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:43.270
today because the
world is so mechanized,

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:47.020
and we're all so busy that
moments of real kindness

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:50.210
and intimacy we all crave.

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:53.390
So being able to invest
in your friendships.

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:58.150
And you know, 300 Facebook
friends does not equal one

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:01.250
really good friend,
nor does a world

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:05.500
of infinite and free
pornography substitute

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.800
for intimate or
sexual satisfaction.

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.660
And we have a nasty
habit of using technology

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:16.220
to think that we are connecting
with people when, really, we're

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:20.620
just getting the superficial
on the surface level

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:25.410
and not getting the real meat
or heart of what we're after.

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:27.490
And that's why I
say that you have

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:32.520
to be careful of widgets
of mass distraction.

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.250
A sixth key to
finding happiness is

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:37.634
being willing to
face your fears.

00:23:37.634 --> 00:23:39.050
As you get older,
it's really easy

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:46.424
to get lost in security
and a groove and a rut.

00:23:46.424 --> 00:23:48.590
And the only difference
between a groove and a grave

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:51.980
is a couple of feet, so you
have to be careful about that.

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:56.620
And being willing to face
your fears of embarrassment,

00:23:56.620 --> 00:24:00.140
failure, rejection.

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:04.010
And this is hard, but
that is one of the keys

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:06.240
to help make you a
more expanded person.

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:09.960
Now I was really a
shy person as a kid.

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:13.150
I was so shy that by
the time I was 17,

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:16.790
I never actually had asked
a woman out on a date.

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:19.760
But it is possible to learn to
overcome your fears relatively

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:20.660
quickly.

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:22.410
So what I did was
I said, I'm going

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:26.960
to get rejected by 10 women
in one day, and if I do that,

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:30.650
I will treat myself
to a trip to Hawaii.

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:32.480
So I went to the
university bookstore

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.840
and I go up to a woman.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:38.410
And I'm literally drenched
in sweat-- beads of sweat

00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:39.570
dripping down my face.

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:46.260
I'm shaking, and I go up to
a woman, and I go, hello.

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:48.990
This poor girl, she
looks at me and she says,

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:49.740
are you all right?

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:52.800
Do you need an ambulance?

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.900
She thought I was having
some kind of seizure.

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.720
I said, no, don't
call an ambulance.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.990
So obviously, an awkward
conversation ensued,

00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:03.710
and I asked her out and she
said, no, I have a boyfriend,

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:04.780
but thank you for asking.

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:06.630
I really appreciate that.

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:07.440
Are sure you're OK?

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:07.940
Yeah.

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:12.790
One down, nine more to go.

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:16.050
And when you face your fears,
it gets easier and easier

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:16.840
with each person.

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.280
So by the fourth woman,
I'm feeling like, wow, I'm

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:20.660
breaking through
a lifelong fear.

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:22.610
This feels great.

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:25.020
I could do this
every Friday night.

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:27.040
So I'm going through this,
but the seventh woman

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.270
ruined my momentum.

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:31.720
By now, I kind of had a
script, I knew how it would go.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.060
So I say, hey, I'm new here.

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:34.230
I haven't met many people.

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:35.620
You look very nice.

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:37.990
Would you be interested
in going out some time?

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:42.340
And she said, sure.

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:46.880
It was at that moment I realized
I had no script for "sure."

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.740
So I said, sure what?

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:50.830
She said, I'd love
to go out with you.

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:51.350
Really?

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.850
OK.

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:52.850
I wrote down her number.

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:53.630
Great.

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:55.840
Now I feel really happy.

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.930
And when you are
happy, it kind of

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:01.310
is like a magnet towards you.

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:04.080
So the next woman said
yes, and the next,

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.630
and the next, and the next,
and the next, and the next,

00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:08.680
and the next.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.000
I had eight straight dates.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.400
Now I had a new problem.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:15.760
I needed three more rejections
or I couldn't go to Hawaii.

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:17.670
So I figured I'd start
acting like a jerk.

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:25.370
So I go up to a woman,
I go hey sugar lips.

00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:28.436
What do you say you come
to my place Friday night.

00:26:28.436 --> 00:26:29.810
I'll show you a
really good time.

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:31.300
What do you say, honey?

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:35.880
She looks at me not unlike
you're looking at me right now.

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.570
Then she says, sure.

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:40.564
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:40.564 --> 00:26:42.980
JONATHAN ROBINSON: She figured
anybody that weird or funny

00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:44.737
she wanted to get to know.

00:26:44.737 --> 00:26:45.570
So that didn't work.

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:47.260
But I threw on some water.

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:48.660
I did my shaking routine.

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.080
I got my three final rejections.

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:53.900
I went to Hawaii,
but most important, I

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:58.750
learned that facing your
fear is a learnable skill

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:03.020
and that you can overcome
lifelong fears in an hour.

00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:05.810
People ask me, how did I meet
Mother Teresa, the Dalai Lama,

00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:07.190
Deepak Chopra, all these people?

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:10.130
I said, well, when I have 17,
I faced my fear of rejection.

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:13.560
I took it from a 10
to a 5 in one hour,

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:16.070
and that changed my life.

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:18.480
So being willing to
do that is really key.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.600
Fear of embarrassment,
fear of failure,

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:24.100
fear of rejection--
the big three.

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:26.210
Just out of curiosity--
probably a lot you

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:30.100
saw the movie "The Matrix"
in which Neo is asked,

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:34.240
do you want a red pill,
which involves seeing

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:37.920
the truth about yourself
and facing fear;

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.990
or do you want the
blue pill, which

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:44.827
involves being lulled to sleep,
believing whatever you want?

00:27:44.827 --> 00:27:46.660
Just out of a show of
hands, how many of you

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:50.380
Googlers would say
that, given that choice,

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:53.719
that you would have
chosen the red pill?

00:27:53.719 --> 00:27:55.510
Raise your hand if
you're in that category.

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:57.720
OK, good.

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:00.116
Now many think you would
have taken the blue bill?

00:28:00.116 --> 00:28:00.616
None?

00:28:00.616 --> 00:28:01.900
Wow.

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:03.040
That's impressive.

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.900
Must be a pretty fearless group.

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:07.010
That's good to know.

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:08.060
OK.

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:11.260
It's important to know that
because that decision--

00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:13.950
whether you're a red or a
blue pill taker-- really

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:16.995
determines the course of your
life to a very large extent.

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.700
Seventh key to knowing
how to be happy

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:24.470
is to know your inner obstacles.

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:28.230
As Socrates said, know thyself.

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:30.970
And that involves knowing
what's in the way of you

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:33.490
being happier.

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:36.116
Now I have a very--
I'm a psychotherapist,

00:28:36.116 --> 00:28:40.280
and I'm very good at pinpointing
for people their biggest

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:44.032
obstacle in the way
of them being happier.

00:28:44.032 --> 00:28:45.470
And I'll show you how I do this.

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:51.370
What I need is a volunteer
willing to come up and work

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:52.690
with me.

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:54.710
Raise your hand if you're
willing to volunteer.

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:55.270
OK, great.

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:58.290
Hold on just one second.

00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:00.720
I think something
is very interesting,

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:05.480
and that is about a minute
ago, everybody in this room

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.600
was a red pill taker.

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.060
And then when I
say, would you like

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:12.480
to take a red pill now and
know the truth of yourself

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:16.630
as something that's in the
way have you being happier,

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:19.270
there was only one
red pill taker.

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:21.830
Isn't that interesting?

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:24.190
You may not be as
dedicated to the red pill

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:27.790
as you think because
when I asked, would you

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:31.850
like to face a small amount
of potential embarrassment

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:38.490
to know a valuable truth about
yourself, 98% of you said,

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:39.240
yeah, but not now.

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:45.240
So one obstacle that you
might have to being happier

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:48.860
is that you have an ability
to say some story in your head

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:54.280
as to why now is not a good
time to take a red pill.

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.790
And that gets in the
way of us being happier.

00:29:56.790 --> 00:30:00.410
So just think back, what
did you say to yourself

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:02.140
so that you didn't
have to come up here?

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:05.435
This gentleman here
didn't have the same story

00:30:05.435 --> 00:30:07.285
or excuse that you did.

00:30:07.285 --> 00:30:11.342
And since he didn't,
he gets a free book.

00:30:11.342 --> 00:30:12.967
Let's give them a
hand for being brave.

00:30:12.967 --> 00:30:18.330
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:20.830
JONATHAN ROBINSON:
Really, now I'm

00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:23.170
an easily fearful
person as well.

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:24.890
I don't like being
embarrassed, but I

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:27.240
am aware of the story in my
head that I always come up

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:30.330
with for why now is not the
time to take the red pill.

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:32.060
And sometimes--
not all the time--

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:34.924
but sometimes, I
transcend that story.

00:30:34.924 --> 00:30:36.840
But first you have to
know what that story is,

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:41.530
and you have to know that we're
always given an opportunity

00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:43.160
to take the red
pill or a blue pill.

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:44.850
It's not one choice you make.

00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:49.230
It's a choice you
make 100 times a day.

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:51.660
Whether or not to say
hello to the person,

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:53.720
whether or not to say what
you're really thinking

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:59.260
about them, whether or
not to say what you want.

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:01.500
Those are little
red pill moments.

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.080
And the more that
you take it, the more

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.740
expanded your life
is likely to be.

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:13.580
An eighth key for being happy
is to master the meaning

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:15.277
that your mind creates.

00:31:15.277 --> 00:31:17.110
I mentioned before that
our minds are always

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:22.080
creating a sense of
Velcro for negativity,

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:25.714
and we want to make
it more like Teflon.

00:31:25.714 --> 00:31:27.380
How do you do that
in the midst of life?

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:30.340
You get in a car accident, you
think, oh, this is horrible.

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:32.650
Well, we need to be
able in that moment

00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:35.460
to change the meaning
we create for things

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:38.362
so that we don't feel bad
for a long period of time.

00:31:38.362 --> 00:31:41.710
I'm reminded of a
story-- a businessman who

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:46.300
once came to counseling for
me, he shared this story.

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:48.520
And he was kind of an
arrogant, rich guy,

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.700
and he said he was in
Thailand traveling.

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:54.095
He went up to a monk
and he said to the monk,

00:31:54.095 --> 00:31:57.030
well, if you're so
wise, why don't you

00:31:57.030 --> 00:32:00.210
teach me a lesson
about Heaven and Hell?

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:02.680
So this monk looks
up at him and says,

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:05.050
teach you about Heaven and Hell?

00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:07.380
I couldn't teach you anything.

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:09.410
You are like an arrogant man.

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:11.580
You don't have a caring
bone in your body.

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:12.600
You even smell bad.

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.930
You probably eat meat.

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:16.770
You just don't care
about anything.

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:20.460
Just get out of my sight
and stop wasting my time.

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:21.920
Well, the man gets
red in the face.

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:22.950
He shakes with rage.

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:25.820
He gets ready to punch
this monk in the face.

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:27.810
And an instant before
he throws the punch,

00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:30.070
the monk says, that's Hell.

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:36.300
Well, the man was
just overwhelmed

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:39.410
that this monk risking
beaten up to teach him

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:41.330
this lesson about Hell.

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:44.440
He unclinched his fist, and
then he bowed to the monk.

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:46.600
And the monk said,
and that's Heaven.

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:52.040
What I like about that
story is that we're always

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.160
creating our own moments
of Heaven and Hell

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.580
by how we interpret things.

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:57.440
He interpreted the
first words-- I'm

00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:00.950
be insulted for no good reason--
created a moment of Hell.

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:02.500
He took the same
words a moment later

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:04.916
and said that this person just
taught me a valuable lesson

00:33:04.916 --> 00:33:07.640
and created a
moment of gratitude.

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:09.300
So how to do this
in a simple way?

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:11.160
Well, there's one
question I use,

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:16.450
and the question is what
could be good about this?

00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:18.220
What could potentially
be good about this?

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:20.095
I mean, taking on
something big, like, again,

00:33:20.095 --> 00:33:21.379
to a fender bender.

00:33:21.379 --> 00:33:23.670
You don't think what could
be good about this normally,

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:25.640
but hey, maybe I'll
meet this person.

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:31.400
Maybe I was destined-- I met
my wife in a fender bender.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:34.930
That was useful.

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:39.640
You could see focus
on, well, I might

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:41.369
have been in a worse
accident later.

00:33:41.369 --> 00:33:42.660
I might have been killed later.

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:45.550
Now I'm not going to because
I'm in a little fender bender.

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:47.370
Or who knows what
you might think of.

00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:51.950
Maybe this will help me to
become a more careful driver.

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:54.820
Whatever it is, we're
always making up the future.

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:56.660
We don't know.

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:58.929
You might as well make
it up so it's empowering,

00:33:58.929 --> 00:34:00.970
and a simple question like
that can help do that.

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:08.880
This is me doing magic
for Syrian refugees

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.949
a couple months ago.

00:34:10.949 --> 00:34:14.770
These are kids who
have lost parents,

00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:18.170
lost limbs, and
certainly lost a country.

00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:23.110
But in a moment of play and
humor, everybody is smiles.

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:25.790
That's a power of
play and humor.

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:26.870
And that's a skill.

00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:28.286
It's not a skill
we have to learn.

00:34:28.286 --> 00:34:30.550
Every three-year-old is playful.

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:32.489
Average four-year-old
laughs 100 times a day.

00:34:32.489 --> 00:34:35.840
The average 12-year-old, twice.

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:38.719
So being able to
enjoy play and humor.

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:41.400
And we don't even
play tennis as adults.

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.090
We compete at tennis.

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:46.070
We compete at everything.

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:50.610
But play and humor is a tonic
that makes all of life better.

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:55.139
And to create an analogy that
might help you remember this,

00:34:55.139 --> 00:34:57.680
I'm going to do one
last magic trick.

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.410
Could you throw this to any
random person in the audience?

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:03.070
Just to-- oh, great.

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:03.570
Yeah.

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:11.000
OK, well, what I
want you to do is

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.020
I want you to think of a
number between 1 and 1,000.

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.760
Don't tell me what it is.

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:18.040
And I'm going to write down
what you're going to say.

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.082
OK?

00:35:19.082 --> 00:35:20.540
Now this really is
a random person.

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:22.030
I want you to know that.

00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:23.255
I think I got it.

00:35:29.655 --> 00:35:30.155
OK.

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:37.025
I'm always a little nervous
when it comes to this.

00:35:37.025 --> 00:35:39.650
I'm want you to speak up really
loud so everybody can hear you.

00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:40.983
I'm going to ask you a question.

00:35:40.983 --> 00:35:43.010
Is the number 237?

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:43.899
Yes or no.

00:35:43.899 --> 00:35:44.440
AUDIENCE: No.

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:47.810
JONATHAN ROBINSON: I wrote
down what he was going to say.

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:50.220
Pretty good, huh?

00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:53.150
You are not impressed evidently.

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:54.910
I can't tell you how
I do that secret,

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:58.730
but what I can tell you
is it does have a point,

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:01.370
and the point is I
try to set up life

00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:04.240
so I have a very good
chance of succeeding.

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:07.180
When you bring play and
humor into your life,

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:10.210
you have a very good
chance of succeeding

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:12.420
at the game of happiness.

00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:14.500
So that's something you
might want to invest in.

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:17.790
And last but not
least, tenth key

00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:20.480
before we go into the future
is if you want to be happy,

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:23.230
you want to learn how
to dive into the now.

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:29.800
Being here now is the
greatest key to happiness.

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.050
And most people think that
they're already in the now,

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:35.140
but mostly we're thinking
of problems and plans

00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:37.620
and relationships in
our chatterbox mind,

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:41.310
and we never learn
how to let go of that.

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:46.430
So we need to learn how to let
go of that and be here now.

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:49.770
And be here now.

00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:51.645
And be here now.

00:36:51.645 --> 00:36:53.270
Now you may be
wondering how many times

00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:54.186
I'm going to say that.

00:36:54.186 --> 00:36:56.040
That's part of being
here now, being

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.990
with what your thoughts
are saying about now.

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:09.610
Being OK with silence is an
important part of being here

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:13.060
now, one that we're not
very good at in this age

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:16.470
where we can always
have something going on.

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:20.040
Learning how to relax
and, beyond the turmoil

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:24.280
of our minds, finding the deeper
ocean where peace actually

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:28.270
always is is part
of being here now.

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:32.510
And that's a skill
that is learnable.

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:35.210
Now we talked about
being happy in the now.

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:38.030
I want to now take
you on a tour of what

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:42.070
is likely to happen towards
happiness in the future.

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:44.070
And one thing to know
is that the stakes

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:47.410
are big because if
we do this wrong,

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:51.380
we could end up like rats
pressing that bar in a cage,

00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:55.490
stimulating ourselves
to have instant pleasure

00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:58.620
while everything
else in life goes by.

00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:01.920
Rats will actually die
pressing a pleasure button that

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:06.900
is stimulating the pleasure
center of their brain

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:09.020
because it's so powerful.

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:12.980
Well, it's not long before
we are able to do that,

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:15.560
and we want to make sure
that we don't sacrifice

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:22.130
all the depth of life for
just instinct gratification.

00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:24.760
And there's certainly
billions if not trillions

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:27.120
of dollars at stake
for people who

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:29.880
learn how to help
people feel happy

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:33.460
since that is what
we're ultimately after.

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:36.240
Now there's five new
technologies or approaches

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:38.790
to finding happiness I
want to briefly touch upon,

00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:40.300
and one of them--
the first one--

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:44.610
is what I call sensory
and reality simulators.

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:47.230
And these are already
happening to some extent.

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:49.760
The Oculus Rift VR.

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:53.030
Soon there's going to be
full body suits that people

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:55.180
can wear for virtual reality.

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:58.700
There's other things
like video games.

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:01.630
Young people spend a huge
portion of their lives

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:03.800
watching video games now.

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:05.210
Is that a good thing?

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:06.790
I don't know.

00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:08.540
We're doing an
experiment on humanity

00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:11.490
though in which a
large part of humanity

00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:15.280
is spending most of their free
time either watching TV, being

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:17.330
on the internet, or
doing video games.

00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:20.790
And these will get much, much
better in the next few years,

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:23.500
Much more addictive.

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:26.374
And if you've ever read the
book "Reality Is Broken,"

00:39:26.374 --> 00:39:28.040
I think there's good
sides and bad sides

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:29.760
to be made to this argument.

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.680
But it will be
happening, and it will

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:33.950
impact how people
find happiness.

00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:37.750
A second key-- this is even
a little bit more scary.

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:40.130
These are what I
call brain enhancers.

00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:43.770
These are things like Direct
Brain Stimulation, or DBS.

00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:44.830
Or happy pills.

00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:47.880
If you saw the movie
"Limitless" or "Lucy,"

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:51.520
Big Pharma is spending billions
to find pills that make people

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:53.320
happy, more alert,
more productive.

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:56.417
They've we've done some good
ones now in clinical trials

00:39:56.417 --> 00:39:57.750
and they're going to get better.

00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:59.420
Things like EEG.

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:01.050
Right here, this
came out last month.

00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:08.415
This is a four-channel mobile
EEG that you wear like this.

00:40:08.415 --> 00:40:11.050
It comes out on your
smartphone and it gives you

00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:13.140
an audio signal
or a visual signal

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:16.150
as to whether you're moving
towards peace of mind or not.

00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:18.110
$300, came out last month.

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:19.570
It's called the Muse.

00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:21.680
Those are going to
get better and better.

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:24.260
Then there's things like
transcranial magnetic

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:30.000
stimulation-- how to stimulate
the brain magnetically

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.370
to get to the pleasure
centers of the brain.

00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:35.430
Or DBS-- put an electrode
in the brain right

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:36.890
into the pleasure center.

00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:39.690
They do this for severely
depressed people right now.

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:41.640
Works extremely well.

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:44.820
Right now, the people do not
have control of their own brain

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:47.240
pacemaker because
they found that they

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:51.569
were hitting that
button way too often.

00:40:51.569 --> 00:40:53.360
Do you think somebody's
going to figure out

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:56.310
how to get control of
that brain pacemaker?

00:40:56.310 --> 00:40:57.506
I bet they will.

00:40:57.506 --> 00:40:58.880
So these are some
things that are

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:02.550
going to affect human beings
and will be available soon.

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:07.166
Third key, or third technology,
is social robots and AI.

00:41:07.166 --> 00:41:08.665
If you saw the movie
"Her," you know

00:41:08.665 --> 00:41:10.942
that it looks like
pretty good to fall

00:41:10.942 --> 00:41:12.400
in love with your
operating system.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:17.210
That technology is probably
12 to 15 years away.

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:19.600
There is a technology
now called Roxxxy

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:28.010
the Sex Robot, which sounds
really gross, doesn't it?

00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:32.770
And so I talked to a guy who
owned a Roxxxy the Sex Robot.

00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:36.020
And this had a big
yuck factor for me.

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:39.391
But as you talked, I'm going,
well, that sounds reasonable.

00:41:39.391 --> 00:41:41.140
And he said something
like, well, Roxxxy's

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:42.250
always available.

00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:44.500
And then he said, best
sex I've ever had.

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:49.640
Really?

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.490
And I said, how much is she?

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:55.380
And he said, about
$3,000-- or as he put it,

00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:56.800
a lot less than
my first marriage.

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:06.300
Now I didn't buy
one of these-- yet--

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:09.250
but you can see that as this
technology-- oh, and Roxxxy

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:09.770
talks.

00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:12.103
You can have a conversation
with her, kind of like Siri.

00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:18.260
But that conversation is
going to get better over time.

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:21.240
And you can see that
people-- in Japan,

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:23.770
these robots are
becoming more widespread,

00:42:23.770 --> 00:42:27.260
that these technologies of
actually having relationships

00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:30.550
with robots is
not that far away.

00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:34.240
And it's better that we
decide now what kind of person

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:36.220
we want to be because
technology has

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:37.960
a way of creeping up on this.

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:41.280
The average person now looks
at their smartphone 110 times

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:44.260
today, but if you take
down the bottom 10%,

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:47.401
it's actually 190 times a day.

00:42:47.401 --> 00:42:48.900
20 years ago, we
wouldn't have said,

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:53.610
yes, I'm going to be interrupted
every three minutes in my life

00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:58.760
by something on a screen, yet
now we don't even notice it.

00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:01.200
It's accepted.

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:03.850
So these technologies are
getting better and better,

00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:09.040
and we have to decide is this
a good thing or not for us.

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:11.770
According to Google's
own Ray Kurzweil,

00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:14.950
"By 2030, technology will
enable us to process thoughts

00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:17.750
millions of times
faster than today.

00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:19.840
With faster thinking,
we can develop an idea

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:21.720
or face a situation
and immediately

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:25.350
run thousands of what-if
simulations in our mind,

00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:27.890
ensuring a correct
decision always.

00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:30.310
This ability to
never make mistakes

00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:34.280
will enhance our peace
of mind and happiness."

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:38.750
Basically, we will have
artificial intelligence coaches

00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:41.480
that will help guide us
towards better happiness.

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:44.110
Well, we're not that good at
it, so maybe that's a good idea.

00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:44.984
Maybe not.

00:43:44.984 --> 00:43:46.150
Maybe it'll make us happier.

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:48.020
Maybe it'll make
us more infantile.

00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:48.670
I don't know.

00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:51.760
But I thought I would show you
what such a thing might look

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:57.880
like in a Google search
of the near-term future.

00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:59.380
And here's my version of that.

00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:08.350
Hello, Google.

00:44:08.350 --> 00:44:11.182
Wait, let me get this a
little bit louder here.

00:44:11.182 --> 00:44:12.510
Hi Google.

00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:13.880
COMPUTER: Hello.

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:15.255
JONATHAN ROBINSON:
I'm wondering,

00:44:15.255 --> 00:44:16.780
what can I do to be happier?

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:20.250
COMPUTER: What KIND of happiness
are you looking for, Jonathan?

00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:22.690
Are you looking for
a good time tonight?

00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:24.290
More peace of mind?

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:25.460
More play?

00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:27.947
Or perhaps a
romantic connection?

00:44:27.947 --> 00:44:29.530
JONATHAN ROBINSON:
I think I'm looking

00:44:29.530 --> 00:44:31.710
for a woman who would
a good match for me,

00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:33.910
enjoy sports like I do?

00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:36.580
COMPUTER: Based on what I know
about your taste in women,

00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:40.080
within a 10 mile radius,
I found seven women

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:43.670
who match your personality
type and enjoy sports.

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:46.280
They all could be a very
good match as for you.

00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:49.170
JONATHAN ROBINSON: Well,
that sounds interesting.

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:51.830
COMPUTER: Here's a picture
of my favorite match for you.

00:44:51.830 --> 00:44:53.530
Her name is Kirsten.

00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:56.919
She's a therapist like you,
and she loves football.

00:44:56.919 --> 00:44:59.335
JONATHAN ROBINSON: Well, can
you send me more information?

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:04.090
COMPUTER: Already in your inbox.

00:45:04.090 --> 00:45:08.570
By the way, she loves roses, so
if you go on a date with her,

00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:10.970
make sure you bring
a dozen roses.

00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:13.400
That'll make a great
first impression.

00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:15.580
JONATHAN ROBINSON:
Well, thanks, Google.

00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:18.290
COMPUTER: Anything else I
can do for you, sweetie?

00:45:18.290 --> 00:45:19.910
JONATHAN ROBINSON:
Yeah, do you think

00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:22.360
this shirt goes with
this sport jacket?

00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:24.050
COMPUTER: Absolutely.

00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:25.987
You're looking hot.

00:45:25.987 --> 00:45:27.320
JONATHAN ROBINSON: Well, thanks.

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:29.060
I'll talk to you later.

00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:31.270
COMPUTER: I look forward to it.

00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:33.320
JONATHAN ROBINSON: Now
won't that be great?

00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:34.680
So what are you guys doing here?

00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:37.650
Get to work.

00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:39.020
Come on.

00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:42.550
I hope it'll be great.

00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:43.520
I don't really know.

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:45.620
But those types of
things will influence

00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:49.720
how we pursue happiness
in the future.

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:52.400
And people are going to
want technologies like that

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.970
because, as I said,
most people are pretty

00:45:54.970 --> 00:45:59.560
bad at learning how to be happy.

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:01.820
A fourth key or
technology is what

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:04.230
I call high vibration emitters.

00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:07.840
These are devices, kind of like
this one-- this device actually

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:12.700
emits vibrations that make
people feel high and good.

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:15.350
I brought my friend over
here, Dr Norman McVeigh,

00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:16.990
who invents devices like this.

00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:18.600
Raise your hand, Norman.

00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:20.490
And he has invented
machines where

00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:25.160
he can get a whole room to
get stoned at the same time

00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:27.860
without having to
smoke anything.

00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:29.640
This technology is
getting better as

00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:31.470
with other technologies.

00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:35.430
And soon, people are going to
want to have access to that.

00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:37.670
This man with the
afro down here,

00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:39.790
Sai Baba, he was
a guru in India.

00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:40.490
He's gone now.

00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:42.610
But he could emit a
vibration that if I

00:46:42.610 --> 00:46:47.130
was within a mile of him, I
would feel a state of bliss.

00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:48.840
Now when we are
able to figure out

00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:51.470
what vibration that
person is putting off

00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:53.610
and can duplicate
it, that's going

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:55.600
to be a very popular technology.

00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:58.796
I can tell you that.

00:46:58.796 --> 00:47:00.420
Now a question we
have to ask ourselves

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:03.660
is, have the
machines already won?

00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:07.170
10% of people are looking at
their smartphone during sex.

00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:15.690
We consume over seven
hours of media a day.

00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:17.670
That's a lot of time.

00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:20.330
That's average.

00:47:20.330 --> 00:47:23.700
We check our phones an average
of 110 times a day-- a lot more

00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:25.420
for many people.

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:27.740
And we have to
know, is this adding

00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:30.010
to the depth and
quality of our life?

00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:31.880
In some cases, yes.

00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:34.390
And in some cases,
it's an avoidance.

00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:39.330
We do it to avoid
pain, and using

00:47:39.330 --> 00:47:41.700
technology or any
distracted device

00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:43.850
to get us away
from our humanness

00:47:43.850 --> 00:47:48.120
and from being here now I
don't think is a good thing.

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:51.780
Will we have the ability to
discern between those two?

00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:54.990
Right now, we're not
doing such a good job.

00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:56.850
But these are important
topics to talk about

00:47:56.850 --> 00:47:59.940
because we all want
a life of depth.

00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:03.190
We all want the juice of life.

00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:07.159
And that, in some ways, is
becoming harder and harder

00:48:07.159 --> 00:48:08.450
as these technologies progress.

00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:14.360
So our happiness
challenge-- actually, I

00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:15.830
want to go into one more.

00:48:15.830 --> 00:48:18.440
I think I missed it here.

00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:20.596
I want to talk about
one more thing before I

00:48:20.596 --> 00:48:22.220
go into a happiness
challenge, and that

00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:25.250
is that spiritual and
psychological goal

00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:28.520
technologies are
also progressing,

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:31.650
that we are learning
how to develop and help

00:48:31.650 --> 00:48:33.737
people towards peace of mind.

00:48:33.737 --> 00:48:35.570
It used to be you were
a Christian or a Jew,

00:48:35.570 --> 00:48:37.403
you were born that way,
you stayed that way.

00:48:37.403 --> 00:48:40.100
But what if you could take
a personality test that

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:43.880
could say, this is going to
help you the most spiritually,

00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:47.700
or this is going to help you
the most psychologically.

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:49.970
Technologies like
neurolinguistic programming

00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:56.701
or EMDR or EFT-- they all go
by these very long initials--

00:48:56.701 --> 00:48:58.075
these are developing
technologies

00:48:58.075 --> 00:49:01.570
that, as a therapist, I know can
help people pass trauma, help

00:49:01.570 --> 00:49:03.870
them to feel good
relatively quickly

00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:07.090
without months of talk therapy.

00:49:07.090 --> 00:49:10.140
Same with spiritual
methods-- different types

00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:12.050
of meditations, different
types of techniques

00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:13.500
for different types of folks.

00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:16.490
The integral of meditation
movement, integral spirituality

00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:19.930
led by Ken Wilber-- all
different ways to help people

00:49:19.930 --> 00:49:23.500
know exactly what will help
with their shortcomings

00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:27.270
so that they can progress
as quickly as possible.

00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:29.010
Now part of our
happiness challenge

00:49:29.010 --> 00:49:33.030
is to pursue connection and
meaning, not just pleasure;

00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:35.650
to be able to keep
our social bonds

00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:38.230
alive despite distraction.

00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:41.190
You can use Skype to
connect with people

00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:43.060
you wouldn't normally
connect with.

00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:44.320
That's important.

00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:47.640
To be able to question
if new gadgets are really

00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:48.440
making us happier.

00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:53.430
Now I must admit to you
that I am an addict.

00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:55.762
I love gadgets.

00:49:55.762 --> 00:49:58.220
Now when I saw that people were
looking at their smartphone

00:49:58.220 --> 00:49:59.950
during sex and having
sex with robots,

00:49:59.950 --> 00:50:02.260
I started to feel
a little superior.

00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:04.120
Oh, I don't do that.

00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:06.260
And then my wife
suggested I do a two day

00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:11.310
fast from anything
with a screen.

00:50:11.310 --> 00:50:12.852
It was not pretty.

00:50:12.852 --> 00:50:15.290
I'm like sneaking
looks at my smartphone

00:50:15.290 --> 00:50:17.060
while she's talking
to me or something.

00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:21.140
It was very humbling
and very difficult,

00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:24.160
but ultimately very satisfying.

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:26.680
Now obviously, we need to
balance all these things

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:30.060
if we want to be happy, because
happiness does require balance.

00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:32.410
But having that as part
of the conversation

00:50:32.410 --> 00:50:36.170
is important because the
whole culture is moving

00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:39.102
towards bigger, faster, more
and bigger, faster, more

00:50:39.102 --> 00:50:40.685
is not always what
leads to happiness.

00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:47.520
In a little bit, I'm
going to end with a story.

00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:49.970
If you want to
find more about me,

00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:51.530
I have a website,
FindingHappiness.

00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:55.000
It has a lot of free stuff on
it, including happiness tips.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:58.750
I have the "Find Happiness
Now" book back there.

00:50:58.750 --> 00:51:01.000
I have a six CD set
on deeper happiness,

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.320
I do coaching seminars,
blah, blah, blah.

00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:06.950
You can get cards from
me, whatever it is.

00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:09.010
I do want to end with
a story, and then we'll

00:51:09.010 --> 00:51:11.580
open up to question and answer.

00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:16.740
Many years ago, I went to
see another guru in India.

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:19.190
Looked like this.

00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:20.900
Named [? Punjati ?].

00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:24.270
And once again, you fly to
India, you're jet lagged.

00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:25.550
You're a little disoriented.

00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:29.310
The moment I walked into his
ashram, he said, you, sit here.

00:51:29.310 --> 00:51:30.220
I go, OK.

00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:32.310
So I sit in front of this guy.

00:51:32.310 --> 00:51:34.670
And he looks at
me really closely.

00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:40.060
He goes right up to me
and he goes, who are you?

00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:43.190
Well, I didn't know what
the protocol was, so I said,

00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:47.290
I'm Jonathan Robinson
from the United States.

00:51:47.290 --> 00:51:49.970
And him and everybody in
the room busted up laughing.

00:51:52.830 --> 00:51:54.560
I thought that was
the wrong answer.

00:51:57.171 --> 00:51:58.295
And then he had compassion.

00:51:58.295 --> 00:52:01.590
He said, no, who are you really?

00:52:01.590 --> 00:52:06.540
And I tried different answers--
I'm a husband, I'm an author,

00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:08.210
I'm a speaker, whatever it is.

00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:10.915
And he kept on saying, no, no,
that's not it, that's not it,

00:52:10.915 --> 00:52:11.650
no.

00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:13.385
And finally, I ran
out of answers,

00:52:13.385 --> 00:52:16.240
and I just looked in
his eyes, and his eyes

00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:19.270
were like sparkling diamonds.

00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:22.450
I started to feel like I was
falling in love with this guy.

00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:26.040
And I felt like that
choice between the red pill

00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:30.700
and the blue pill-- do I
close up or do I let go?

00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:32.128
In this case, I let go.

00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:39.300
And a wave of love just hit me.

00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:42.200
And before I knew it,
I was just crying.

00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:43.210
I just kept crying.

00:52:43.210 --> 00:52:44.790
I couldn't stop crying.

00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:48.540
I had never felt so
much love in my life.

00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:50.830
And I'm sitting
there practically

00:52:50.830 --> 00:52:52.610
drooling in his lap crying.

00:52:52.610 --> 00:52:58.430
And as I'm in his lap crying,
he taps me on the head

00:52:58.430 --> 00:53:00.170
and he said something
I'll never forget.

00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:06.530
He says, this love you're
feeling now is who you are.

00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:12.710
This joy you're feeling now is
who you are in your essence.

00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:18.071
And your job in this world
is to never forget that.

00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:27.800
So that has stayed with me,
and I echo his words to you.

00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:37.640
Love is who we are, and your
job is to get in touch with that

00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:40.920
because only if you get in
touch with some peace and love

00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:43.590
and happiness can
you really give

00:53:43.590 --> 00:53:46.880
your best to a world
in desperate need,

00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:51.771
and really give your best to
the people you most care about.

00:53:51.771 --> 00:53:53.270
Thank you for
listening to me today.

00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.770
Thank you.

00:53:53.770 --> 00:53:57.599
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:00.507 --> 00:54:01.590
FEMALE SPEAKER: Questions?

00:54:01.590 --> 00:54:03.625
Anyone have a question?

00:54:03.625 --> 00:54:05.250
AUDIENCE: I think
from the presentation

00:54:05.250 --> 00:54:09.110
the part that especially
for me resonates the most

00:54:09.110 --> 00:54:11.420
or I get more
questions about is when

00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:13.630
you talk about what's
happiness for you

00:54:13.630 --> 00:54:15.175
or what are your fears and--

00:54:15.175 --> 00:54:16.800
JONATHAN ROBINSON:
What are your fears?

00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:19.169
AUDIENCE: Yeah, and what
is happening is happiness.

00:54:19.169 --> 00:54:21.710
And I find that those are kind
of like the biggest questions.

00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:24.480
And after many,
many years, I still

00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:27.319
don't think that I know what
[INAUDIBLE] answer that.

00:54:27.319 --> 00:54:28.360
JONATHAN ROBINSON: Right.

00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:31.340
One, with questions,
you don't have

00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:34.150
to think so much in
trying to find an answer.

00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:38.075
Sometimes the
question is the path.

00:54:38.075 --> 00:54:40.630
I have the same questions
I had-- how to find peace?

00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:43.380
That's like an ongoing question.

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:47.830
Now I keep on learning as
I explore that question,

00:54:47.830 --> 00:54:49.860
but there is no final answer.

00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:51.616
There's better
and better answers

00:54:51.616 --> 00:54:52.740
that are deeper and deeper.

00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:55.540
So keep on exploring a question
that resonates for you.

00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:59.810
I'm still focusing on
how can I open my heart.

00:54:59.810 --> 00:55:01.580
There's not just
one answer to that.

00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:02.970
That is a lifelong question.

00:55:02.970 --> 00:55:06.550
It's like a friend, and
it keeps on-- as I ask it,

00:55:06.550 --> 00:55:09.790
I keep on getting to deeper and
deeper, more subtle and subtle

00:55:09.790 --> 00:55:11.530
levels of that question.

00:55:11.530 --> 00:55:13.780
Or how can I know
gratitude more?

00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:16.600
Just keep that question
alive in your life.

00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:19.570
AUDIENCE: I've kind of been
thinking about happiness

00:55:19.570 --> 00:55:22.530
in general for a few
months now, I think.

00:55:22.530 --> 00:55:24.450
I got caught in the rat
race for several years

00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:27.710
working, and working
toward that end goal, sort

00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:30.160
of career development
and all those things.

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:36.190
But I was wondering if-- I think
a lot of times we get caught up

00:55:36.190 --> 00:55:39.060
trying to find pure joy
and elation every day.

00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:40.550
Do you think some
of the happiness

00:55:40.550 --> 00:55:45.710
is just kind of being OK
with whatever it is at home?

00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:48.890
All right, so maybe
not this 100% number

00:55:48.890 --> 00:55:52.360
you're looking for,
but like, hey, 80%,

00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:53.820
I'm pretty good most the time.

00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:55.445
There's going to be
some ups and downs.

00:55:55.445 --> 00:55:57.030
Do you look at it like that?

00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:58.200
Or is there maybe--

00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:00.200
JONATHAN ROBINSON: Yeah,
I look at it like that.

00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:02.206
And everybody, no matter
how happy they are,

00:56:02.206 --> 00:56:04.230
they have good
moments, bad moments.

00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:06.910
Every now and then, you'll
find yourself in a good moment.

00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:09.030
That happens, right?

00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:11.380
Give it some more space.

00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:14.140
A lot of times, you're
happy-- the other day,

00:56:14.140 --> 00:56:15.960
I was enjoying my dog.

00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:18.250
I was petting her, telling
her how much I love her.

00:56:18.250 --> 00:56:20.250
And then I thought, oh,
I got stuff to do today.

00:56:20.250 --> 00:56:22.374
And I said, what could be
more important than this?

00:56:22.374 --> 00:56:23.350
I'm loving this.

00:56:23.350 --> 00:56:24.280
My dog's loving it.

00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:26.363
I'm just going to sit here
and keep on telling her

00:56:26.363 --> 00:56:29.320
how much I love her until I
don't want to do that anymore.

00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:33.800
We don't even give our happy,
joyful, intimate moments space.

00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:35.990
We're always moving
on to the next thing.

00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:40.230
So one way to be happier is
just to take the happy moments

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:43.390
you have and don't go onto
the next thing so quickly.

00:56:43.390 --> 00:56:45.770
But yeah, wherever
your life is, you're

00:56:45.770 --> 00:56:48.370
going to have ups and downs.

00:56:48.370 --> 00:56:52.770
But over time, you learn to
let go of the negative emotions

00:56:52.770 --> 00:56:53.715
more quickly.

00:56:53.715 --> 00:56:54.590
Think of little kids.

00:56:54.590 --> 00:56:56.660
They let go of negative
emotions like that.

00:56:56.660 --> 00:56:58.870
They can go from
totally having a tantrum

00:56:58.870 --> 00:57:01.890
to fine in two minutes.

00:57:01.890 --> 00:57:04.680
Some adults, they have
a problem with somebody,

00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:07.660
they don't let go for years.

00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:10.070
So you learn to let go of the
negative emotions quickly.

00:57:10.070 --> 00:57:11.690
You give the positive
emotions more space.

00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:13.148
And soon, you'll
find that you just

00:57:13.148 --> 00:57:15.080
feel better a lot
more of the time.

00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:16.060
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Thank you, Jonathan.

00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:18.309
JONATHAN ROBINSON: OK, thank
you very much for coming.

00:57:18.309 --> 00:57:19.630
[APPLAUSE]
