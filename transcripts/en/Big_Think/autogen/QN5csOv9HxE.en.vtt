00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.940
those signals go on beyond the earth and
travel and spread out in a bubble around

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950
travel and spread out in a bubble around
 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.940
travel and spread out in a bubble around
the earth that gets bigger one light

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950
the earth that gets bigger one light
 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.260
the earth that gets bigger one light
year per year so we're announcing our

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270
year per year so we're announcing our
 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.270
year per year so we're announcing our
presence inadvertently that's going to

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280
presence inadvertently that's going to
 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.170
presence inadvertently that's going to
change in the future as we change our

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180
change in the future as we change our
 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.660
change in the future as we change our
means of broadcast technology and go to

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:42.670
means of broadcast technology and go to
 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.820
means of broadcast technology and go to
direct TV kinds of deliveries and

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830
direct TV kinds of deliveries and
 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.420
direct TV kinds of deliveries and
digital but actually even the satellites

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430
digital but actually even the satellites
 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.480
digital but actually even the satellites
that are delivering the signals have

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490
that are delivering the signals have
 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.010
that are delivering the signals have
some leakage out the back side of them

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020
some leakage out the back side of them
 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.130
some leakage out the back side of them
so we'll never go completely radio quiet

00:05:59.130 --> 00:05:59.140
so we'll never go completely radio quiet
 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:03.440
so we'll never go completely radio quiet
but we're not actually deliberately

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:03.450
but we're not actually deliberately
 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.630
but we're not actually deliberately
transmitting signals to different

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:06.640
transmitting signals to different
 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.910
transmitting signals to different
planets we now know about 455 planets

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:11.920
planets we now know about 455 planets
 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.710
planets we now know about 455 planets
around other stars so we are now

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720
around other stars so we are now
 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.150
around other stars so we are now
beginning to know about some of the

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.160
beginning to know about some of the
 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.480
beginning to know about some of the
places we might decide to transmit to

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490
places we might decide to transmit to
 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.080
places we might decide to transmit to
but we're not doing that and the reason

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090
but we're not doing that and the reason
 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:27.480
but we're not doing that and the reason
is we're actually too young right we're

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:27.490
is we're actually too young right we're
 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.420
is we're actually too young right we're
a very young technology in a very old

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430
a very young technology in a very old
 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.690
a very young technology in a very old
galaxy so with respect to interstellar

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:33.700
galaxy so with respect to interstellar
 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.270
galaxy so with respect to interstellar
communication we've had appropriate

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280
communication we've had appropriate
 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.100
communication we've had appropriate
technology from maybe a hundred years

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.110
technology from maybe a hundred years
 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.720
technology from maybe a hundred years
the galaxies 10 billion years old so we

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:42.730
the galaxies 10 billion years old so we
 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.400
the galaxies 10 billion years old so we
don't know whether there are any other

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:44.410
don't know whether there are any other
 

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.760
don't know whether there are any other
technologies out there but we do know

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770
technologies out there but we do know
 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.310
technologies out there but we do know
that we're the youngest that could

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:50.320
that we're the youngest that could
 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.500
that we're the youngest that could
participate in interstellar

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:52.510
participate in interstellar
 

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.970
participate in interstellar
communication anyone younger than we are

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:55.980
communication anyone younger than we are
 

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.800
communication anyone younger than we are
with less technical capabilities and we

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:58.810
with less technical capabilities and we
 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.070
with less technical capabilities and we
have can't yet be part of a conversation

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.080
have can't yet be part of a conversation
 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.150
have can't yet be part of a conversation
and the odds are in a 10 billion year

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.160
and the odds are in a 10 billion year
 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.880
and the odds are in a 10 billion year
old galaxy that anyone elses technology

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:08.890
old galaxy that anyone elses technology
 

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:11.480
old galaxy that anyone elses technology
is a lot older than ours

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:11.490
is a lot older than ours
 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.270
is a lot older than ours
so right now it seems to to me that it's

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:15.280
so right now it seems to to me that it's
 

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.120
so right now it seems to to me that it's
appropriate to let the older technology

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:18.130
appropriate to let the older technology
 

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:21.240
appropriate to let the older technology
do the heavy lifting so transmitting is

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:21.250
do the heavy lifting so transmitting is
 

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.790
do the heavy lifting so transmitting is
harder than receiving so we'll put that

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:23.800
harder than receiving so we'll put that
 

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:31.020
harder than receiving so we'll put that
job on them and then if we ourselves get

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:31.030
job on them and then if we ourselves get
 

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:35.100
job on them and then if we ourselves get
to be an old technology if we grow up if

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:35.110
to be an old technology if we grow up if
 

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:37.010
to be an old technology if we grow up if
we in fact cannot get ourselves

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:37.020
we in fact cannot get ourselves
 

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.410
we in fact cannot get ourselves
organized to be able to take on projects

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:40.420
organized to be able to take on projects
 

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.410
organized to be able to take on projects
that last not two years or five years

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:43.420
that last not two years or five years
 

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.230
that last not two years or five years
but ten thousand years or a hundred

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.240
but ten thousand years or a hundred
 

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.290
but ten thousand years or a hundred
thousand years which is really you need

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:49.300
thousand years which is really you need
 

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.850
thousand years which is really you need
to do if you're thinking about

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:50.860
to do if you're thinking about
 

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:56.220
to do if you're thinking about
transmitting purposefully then when

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:56.230
transmitting purposefully then when
 

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.710
transmitting purposefully then when
we're older it would be appropriate for

00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720
we're older it would be appropriate for
 

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:03.240
we're older it would be appropriate for
us to begin to transmit and of course by

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:03.250
us to begin to transmit and of course by
 

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.100
us to begin to transmit and of course by
then I hope that we could answer the

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:05.110
then I hope that we could answer the
 

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.170
then I hope that we could answer the
question about who should speak for

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:07.180
question about who should speak for
 

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:11.430
question about who should speak for
Earth and and what should they say
