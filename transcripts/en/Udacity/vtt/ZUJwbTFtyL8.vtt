00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.980
Now back to Marla,
who already has four chronic diseases.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.740
She developed diabetes 15 years ago,
and is now showing early signs of lung

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.540
problems, called chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, or COPD for short.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.020
In recent years, her blood
pressure has become elevated, and

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.450
she's also taking medications for that.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.840
She was also recently diagnosed
with a heart problem,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.800
called coronary artery disease,
and needs even more medications.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.680
We already know one thing about
chronic diseases, they can't be cured.

00:00:40.765 --> 00:00:43.940
Marla illustrates two other key points.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.760
They are often caused by behavior.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.770
Marla's obesity is caused
by her poor diet, rich and

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.690
processed foods with too
many calories from fats and

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.430
carbohydrates, combined with far
too little physical activity.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.790
This weight gain contributed
to her developing diabetes and

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.390
high blood pressure.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.870
Her lung disease was
caused by her smoking.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.080
The second key point
about chronic diseases,

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.770
is they can cause other
chronic diseases.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.470
Marla's diabetes and high blood pressure
contributed to the development of her

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:28.550
heart disease, and puts her at greater
risk for a heart attack, or stroke.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.640
If her diabetes and high blood
pressure are not well controlled, she

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.980
could develop chronic kidney disease,
and other more serious problems.
