00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.500
KARL KUSSEROW: I'm Karl
Kusserow, John Wilmerding

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.410
Curator of American Art
at the Princeton

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.130
University Art Museum.


00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.600
And we're here today to talk
about one of the great icons

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.580
of American art and one of the
great treasures of Princeton

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.150
University, Charles Willson
Peale's portrait of George

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.970
Washington at the Battle
of Princeton.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.980
The painting dates to 1784.


00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.240
It is a truly fascinating work
on any number of levels, not

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.040
the least of it, it's close
association with Princeton

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.160
University as an institution.


00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.030
So the frame arrives in
Princeton in January of 1761,

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.590
enclosing a portrait
of King George II.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.940
It was hung in what was then
the prayer hall,--

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.590
It's now the faculty room.


00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.450
--until the Battle of Princeton,
some 16 years later

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:07.190
when, in 1777, the battle
culminated at the back door,

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.790
so to speak, of Nassau Hall.


00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.990
During the final stages of
the battle, the American

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.450
artillery--


00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.800
And it's known that they were
led by Alexander Hamilton,

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.980
though it's unclear whether he
was the one that actually

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.290
fired the fateful shot.


00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.680
--but at any rate, one of those
cannon balls from the

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.000
American artillery entered the
prayer hall and destroyed the

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.620
portrait of King George II
originally hung in this frame.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.670
There is testimony, which is
accredited that the shot took

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.670
off the king's head.


00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.040
Whether or not that's true, the
portrait was destroyed.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.030
And six years later, Peale's
portrait of Washington went

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.990
into the very frame that had
formerly surrounded that of

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.020
the other George,
King George II.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.420
So in a wonderful act of
revolutionary symbolism, you

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.330
have the portrait of our George,
George Washington

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.910
replacing the portrait of King
George II of England, who was

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.550
the person who gave Princeton,
then the College of New

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.880
Jersey, it's charter.


00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.090
We're here now in the faculty
room at Nassau Hall, which is

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.770
where the portrait that we just
left at the art museum

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.170
hung for more than two centuries


00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.330
Happily, Princeton has in its
possession another portrait of

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.000
George Washington as a great
hero, but done in the context

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.470
of a battle that had
already been won.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.000
He rests his hand very
proprietorially on a captured

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
cannon and leans almost in a
jaunty pose, very much at

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
ease, having won this
great victory.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And that's a very different
effect from the portrait at

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.350
the art museum, which shows
the battle still raging.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.600
And the outcome is, in
that case, unclear.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.000
So two portraits very similar
in subject, but taking place

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.530
at different times in the
fictive narrative of what's

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.040
being shown at the Battle
of Princeton.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.780
