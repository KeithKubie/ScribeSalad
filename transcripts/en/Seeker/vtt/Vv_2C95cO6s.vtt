00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.379
Remember when cellphones looked like this?

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:07.350
You could call, text, maybe play snake on
it … and it had about 6 megabytes of memory,

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.010
which was a small miracle at the time.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.230
Then, phones got faster and around every two
years, you probably upgraded your phone from

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.050
8 gigs to 16 to 32 and so on and so forth.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.980
This incremental technological progress we’ve
all been participating in for years hinges

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.570
on one key trend, called Moore’s Law.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:32.579
Co-founder of Intel, Gordon Moore made a prediction
in 1965 that integrated circuits, or chips,

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.309
were the path to cheaper electronics.

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.670
Moore’s law states that the number of transistors,
the tiny switches that control the flow of

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.059
an electrical current that can fit in an integrated
circuit, will double every two years, while

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.629
the cost will halve.

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.159
Chip power goes up as cost goes down.

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:54.690
That exponential growth has brought massive
advances in computing power… hence tiny

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.629
computers in our pockets!

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.359
A single chip today can contain billions of
transistors, and each transistor is about

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.159
14 nanometres across!

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.380
That’s smaller than most human viruses!

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.620
Now, Moore’s law isn’t a law of physics,
it’s just a good hunch that’s driven companies

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.510
to make better chips.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.850
But experts are claiming that this trend is
slowing down.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.310
Granddaddy chip maker Intel recently disclosed
that it's becoming more difficult to roll

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.050
out smaller transistors in a two year timeframe
while also being affordable.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.900
So, to power the next wave of electronics,
there are a few promising options in the works.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.310
One is quantum computing.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.230
Another currently in the lab stage is neuromorphic
computing, which are computer chips that are

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.620
modeled after our own brains!

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.909
They’re basically capable of learning and
remembering all at the same time at an incredibly

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.000
fast clip.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.900
Let’s break that down and start with the
human brain.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.000
So, your brain has billions of neurons, each
of which forms synapses or connections with

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.310
other neurons.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.350
Synaptic activity relies on ion channels,
which control the flow of charged atoms like

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.460
sodium and calcium that make your brain function
and process properly.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.799
So, a neuromorphic chip copies that model
by relying on a densely connected web of transistors

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.769
that mimic the activity of ion channels.

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:19.950
Each chip has a network of cores, with inputs
and outputs that are wired to additional cores,

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.379
which all operate in conjunction with each
other.

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:27.260
Because of this connectivity, neuromorphic
chips are able to integrate memory, computation,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.209
and communication all together.

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.829
These chips are an entirely new computational
design.

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:37.650
Standard chips today are built based on von
Neumann architecture... where the processor

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.150
and memory are separate and the data moves
between them.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.510
A central processing unit runs commands that
are fetched from memory to execute tasks.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.209
This is what’s made computers very good
at computing, but not as efficiently as they

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:51.829
could be.

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:55.579
Neuromorphic chips however completely change
that model by having both storage and processing

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.989
connected within these “neurons” that
are all communicating and learning together.

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.529
The hope is that these neuromorphic chips
could transform computers from general purpose

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:09.019
calculators into machines that can learn from
experience and make decisions.

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.099
We'd leap to a future where computers wouldn't
just be able to crunch data at break neck

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:18.049
speeds but could do that AND process sensory
data in real time.

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:23.129
Some future applications of neuromorphic chips
might include combat robots that could decide

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:27.920
how to act in the field, drones that could
detect changes in the environment, and your

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.689
car taking you to a drive through for ice
cream after being dumped… basically these

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:36.709
chips could power our future robot overlords.

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.870
We don't have machines with sophisticated,
brain-like chips yet but they’re on the

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:41.870
horizon.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.680
So get ready for a whole new meaning for the
term “brain power.”

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.829
But we have something less frightening than
AI to share with you... did you know we have

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.870
a sister channel called Seeker VR?

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.319
It’s everything you love about Seeker, but
in 360 degrees!

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.769
SeekerVR will take you on some incredible
journeys that you probably wouldn’t get

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:57.939
to experience otherwise.

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:03.290
Like in a recent episode, we took a ride on
one of the most deadly trains in the world.

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.690
Check it out here.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.040
Want to learn more about how the fastest computers
in the world work?

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.499
We’ve got a video about them here.

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:13.310
And am I the only one who misses my Motorola
Razr?

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.769
