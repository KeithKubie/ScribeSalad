Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radio lab radio from W N Y. S? Yup.

Speaker 2:          00:08          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11          Hey man, how are ya? So Aaron, set this up. Who are we about to meet? So this is skip Sherry. He lives in Brooklyn and that is, we should say Aaron Scott, he's a reporter who turned us on to skip. And Aaron met up with skip because he had this experience that's common to a lot of people who moved in New York City. Just tell us where you, where you grew up. I grew up in the country outside of Athens, Ohio on 54 acres of woodland. And I would work all day as a kid in the heat hoeing and picking strawberries, hauling water, planting trees. He had planned the woods. I loved the woods. But as he got older he knew he couldn't stay in Athens. Why not? Well, he's a musician. He wanted to make a living at it. So he bounced around for a bit. I finally find them finally at age 30 there was no place to go except for New York's. It wasn't a matter that you wanted to live in New York, New York was your last, my last option. And he hated it because it was ugly

Speaker 3:          01:06          to me. You know, like, like which too many humans. Too many. Too much concrete. Yeah. No. One theory about autism is that the things that come into an autistic kids brain all have equal value. They don't know how to sort through it. And when I first came to New Yorker was, it was really

Speaker 1:          01:30          overwhelming. I had decided to leave for sure, but then take us to the roof. I was lucky when I first moved here. So he's staying with a friend who lives in this big building in Brooklyn Heights right across from the twin towers. It is 36 stories high and he decides one lonely night to go up onto the roof. And there's this intense fog in the twin towers. The bottom of them was covering the fog but not the top. So it was like they were floating. There's little like a cuticle sliver of moon in the sky and the foghorns are going in. The boats are slowly moving.

Speaker 2:          02:12          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          02:12          and there's this Rees and I had this, this brass penny listed that my father had given me, and I was standing there and I was playing it and that I was really suddenly something clicked. I was like, oh, that must, those are all the bridges. That's Williamsburg Bridge. That's the Manhattan bridge. There's the Brooklyn Bridge, that's New York. It's small now.

Speaker 2:          02:37          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          02:38          and I'm looking at the Statue of Liberty and my grandmother, Anastasia Pantie, came from Albania and they went to Ellis island. I could see my history there too, and I was suddenly hit me like, oh my goodness, this is like a coral reef. You can't see the people, but look at this beautiful strip

Speaker 2:          02:59          fog in the air. It was just the whole city was breathing, the whole nature was beating. Everything was [inaudible] breathing. I felt connected on a spiritual level to the city for the first time. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          03:23          and so skip decided to stay for awhile, for awhile. All over the world. People are now moving. Of course, we know this from the country to the city at this point. We'll two years ago across this extraordinary benchmark that's physicist Jeff West, where more than half of the planet is now urbanized 51% yet not made us wonder how do cities work? Is there some deep organic logic that holds all these people together or is writer gentle era puts it. Our city's just these tumors that people on the landscape

Speaker 2:          04:01          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          04:01          I'm Janet. Boom. Ron. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab and our topic today,

Speaker 2:          04:05          cities, cities. I loved it, but I don't know why [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          04:19          All right, so in talking about cities, New York City, it's kind of hard to know where to start because every city has its own DNA, kind of its own unique feel.

Speaker 2:          04:32          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:35          Like for instance, Oh, let me just give you my own stupid example here. So every time I go to St Louis to visit my mom, yeah, I'm gay, I'm on the plane, I'm in my own kind of groove and I step off the plane into the airport and it's just like with the first step, you just hit this wall of something is different. Like you feel the difference in your bone because let's the question I, is he there? Right. I'm here. What gives the city its feel? Oh is this Mr Bob Levine? This is Mr Rob Levin. Mr Bob Levine is a professor of psychology, California State University. And he thinks the answer to that question is time. Time did each city warps time in its own unique way. My cities are my subjects now. He studied this idea for the past 30 years in all kinds of different ways. We looked at things like a percentage of people wearing watches. How long does it take bank tellers in each city to change a $20 bill? Really? Yeah. And then we, we, we looked at talking speed offerings. Yeah. We'd get on the phone and uh, call post offices since that seemed like something that would be available every place and make a standard request.

Speaker 4:          05:39          What'd you tell me the difference between regular mail certified mail and insured mail. Okay. Certified as when you just need someone to sign for it.

Speaker 1:          05:47          Then he says they'd calculate the number of syllables per second

Speaker 4:          05:50          regular mail. Just close your mail. You know if it's out of Utah,

Speaker 1:          05:53          Salt Lake City, Utah, 2.73 syllables per second to put group number three car to come back to your house. Springfield, mass [inaudible] 3.4 or five syllables per second and

Speaker 5:          06:06          certified is when you want a

Speaker 6:          06:09          not really sure where it's from because the tape lost the ID, but it could be Nashville

Speaker 5:          06:13          the daily. They want to know who he wanted return receipt

Speaker 1:          06:17          and if it is national 2.65 syllables per second. Well Springfield is like fuel, but the whole talking thing was just really a prelude for Bob. It got him into what he, I think he's most known for and what we find most fascinating. We actually looked at at walking speed lots.

Speaker 6:          06:34          Yeah. Well what I would do is I would get into a new city and I'm in Mumbai, India, Jerusalem, CD Chiang Mai, Thailand. We actually put out a call to radio lab listeners everywhere in beginner in Liberia to help us repeat the study. Hey, good morning Radiolab. I'm recording from Dublin, Ireland, downtown Oslo, Copenhagen to a new city. And step one, I would scope out main business and shopping books, top and street step to get out some street or roll of spring red strings, two feet long. 20 meters means over here. We wouldn't say feed really. Step three, use that string to measure out the distance. Just have to roll out. You taped the one end to the sidewalk and I would just make a more step four and go undercover. Get into Carter and uh, it'd be cool, you know, act like you're in the paper or waiting for somebody. I found myself a discreet place. Found a pretty nice spot here. You use a stopwatch. I Richard's a stopwatch. Stopwatch trusty beef watchers working. Ready? I'm ready.

Speaker 2:          07:39          Doug. Welcome.

Speaker 6:          07:44          And it know, goes quiet for a minute. I want to start brilliance. Brilliant. Still done. This experiment was actually harder than you would think. Much harder. I love people. This is not very easy to do. Timing was an issue. People trying to sell you stuff. I don't need this to show Betty goose shine. Look in my corner. They just don't, can't no pitches. Okay, ready, boom. All together now,

Speaker 2:          08:06          Dodd walk, step, step, step, step, step, step, step,

Speaker 6:          08:15          Chile. It didn't sound like that at all. They weren't in sync. As you can imagine, every city had its own guard. Step, step, step, step, step, step, step, step. We knew but still change was pretty amazing. Stop toppling to Oslo. 14.4 seconds. 27 seconds. You can live area. So team 0.8 Dwayne is arrows. 12.13 Mexico City, 10.1 seconds. Copenhagen, 21.5 seconds. Yeah, nine 11.57 Portland and a half second Jerusalem. Just to break it down on the high end, you've got steps, steps on it's step, step,

Speaker 1:          08:56          step, step, that Dubliner steps. Okay. She was 9.5 and that's 10.4 who take on average 10.76 seconds to cover 60 feet. Compare that to Buchanan. Liberia

Speaker 7:          09:07          step, step, step, step, step.

Speaker 1:          09:10          Let's get around something that actually owned the head. She got a teen pink blouse whose Walker's covered the same distance in about 21 seconds. 21 seconds. So if you want to think about it in football terms, by the time the Dubliner has scored a touchdown, the gripe from you, Kevin, Liberia is somewhere, I guess around midfield. And the spooky thing according to Bob Levine is if you do these under the same conditions, same place, you will get the same time. These times don't change. Dublin is always about this steps you're on. It's steps, steps, steps, and Buchanan. Liberia is always around this. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          09:46          Step step.

Speaker 1:          09:48          Yeah. Manhattan is, we found is right about here. Usually step with thunder's step, step, step in pink. No, Dublin, but not bad. But why the consistency? What is it? What is it that makes that walking speed?

Speaker 8:          10:03          Yeah. Where does it come from? You know, I mean, is anybody beating the drum? How well can you change the walking speed? Say a bunch of us got together and decided that we were just going to up it by 5% on a given day. Will we get everybody to do it and will they even notice the difference? Do we make the city

Speaker 1:          10:21          or just the city make us

Speaker 6:          10:23          thank you to our lockers. [inaudible] Liberia, Jerusalem, here are killer man. And Copenhagen went to Oslo in the Scott's, Portland, Oregon. Nacho, Thailand, grand fuller game. [inaudible] go city [inaudible] in one bay. Mark

Speaker 1:          10:41          from Nolan. I've Dublin in Ireland perhaps also to Daniel Estrin and an assessment. Well done because they didn't, they didn't say their name so we put them in there. Okay. So getting back to that question I asked a second ago, why is it that cities develop particular beats? Yes. I mean is it because the city does it to the people or the people do it to the city? Yeah, and we ran into a couple of guys who may be released. Have the start of an answer. Yes. No, a couple of physicists, oddly enough high named Geoffrey West and leash. This is Jeffery and there's Lewis on the other side of the table. Cool. Here at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico and lots of bases and stuff. Nothing like the cities we just visited. It's almost biblical in its expanse.

Speaker 1:          11:28          Yeah. But blue skies just sort of make your brain potassium and all those good things. Brave enough, in fact, to claim from their high desert birch that these beats the meter of every city that we've just been to actually has underneath it a kind of logic. If you tell me the average speed of walking in some city x, take a Rochester, New York where people walk at about this 60 feet and 12.67 seconds different. Don't tell him Rochester, you just tell him the number of beats. I will tell you the population is maybe one and a quarter billion people, actual population, 1.0 3 million people and the average weight about $16,000 a year. Actual average wage, $15,588 wow. But let me ask you a precise question. Are you 100% correct? Are you some things you will score close to a hundred percent other things, 80% but if you start with just the number of footfalls per unit of time, they can tell you all kinds of other things about the same place.

Speaker 1:          12:38          I can tell you how much crime there is in the city. Income wages, GDP number college's restaurants, fancy restaurants, theaters, police number of patents are being produced, cultural events per capita, number of theater that libraries, the number of aids cases it's going to have this year. Mainly. All of these things are correlated in a quantitative, and I use the word predictive fashion. Wait, are you saying that just from the number of footsteps per given time that you can tell? Can you tell me how many libraries there are? Yes. Tell me how many hours should expect. Wow. How many things can you count when know? Infinite number, but it's limited by the things for which there are data. They've got data from the u s census, that's Jonah Lehrer. He's written about Luis and Jeff and he's the one who kind of got us thinking about all this pain from Japan, China data from sociological surveys on cell phones and when they put all these numbers together, they discovered a deep pattern call comes from the footsteps, not the footsteps.

Speaker 1:          13:40          The footsteps are a reflection of this deep and fundamental pattern that governs everything. Just one fact. What is it you really want to know? Yeah. What is it? Size, size, how many people live there? Size matters. Size is the largest determinant of all characteristics of a city, right? They would say, tell me the size of the city, and I can explain the vast majority of all of these different variables that we can measure. Right? As a city scales up, they say 100,000 to 200,000 the million to 2 million from 5 million to 10 everything about it. All those things that they'd been measuring, they scale up too, but they scale up according to a very simple mathematical formula. It does not matter that New York has big skyscrapers and is on the ocean and the Boise is in the rocky mountains that San Francisco is on San Francisco Bay. Wait a second.

Speaker 1:          14:37          Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. That can't be. They can't be. I was with you right up until the last to that last point. I mean you go to the Midwest and it's landlocked and then you go to a port city and it's on a part. I mean that's got to matter. It matters, but these actually are superficial effects and account for only 10 20% of their variation. What they're saying is that those specificities, the, the local history is in large part insignificant, but it is completely overwhelmed by these generic laws of urban scaling. That to me is a very interesting and surprising idea simply because we don't think of cities like that at all. No, we certainly do not. That's because you're not a physicist and you don't think abstractly in that regard. Well, why should I? Because sometimes it can be very useful to remember.

Speaker 1:          15:25          What these guys have done is they've just created eight average profile for every size city. So if you're a 1 million or 7 million or 12 million, here's how many things you should have and all you can all say, okay, let's look specifically that city and analysis. Is it overperforming on the performance? So what are some cities that are overperforming for their size? A of the largest cities? San Francisco is quite an innovative city. New York's about average, about times of patents on terms New York's below average produces roughly speaking the number of patents that should for size. You produce for example, about uh, twice as many patents as Boston. We do [inaudible] you should have produced many more given the size difference between about counting patents. I mean who may, who did, we don't have Ng. This is one of the problems with their larger theory, which is that they're relying on your data at the u s census collected. So that's a real blind spot. Fabulous. If we ever can figure out a way to count. Fabulous a point you're not taking into account what it actually the experience of living in a place. Well, what this, what a theory cannot do is tell you about the essence of New York, the new Yorkness of New York,

Speaker 3:          16:42          so to speak, the soul of the city. And where does that come from? I mean, I think that's such a broad question. Well, obviously it has something to do with lots of people being jammed into a tight space. Firemen bumping into each other, the kind of people who move there. What the physicists we call human friction. And that's a story you can't really tell in math, but you can hear it. Take skip. He gave producer Aaron Scott a tour of his block in Brooklyn, listen to who he bumps into every day. So he took us on this tour. First place we went was this Jamaican body shop. Body shop is in cars. Yeah. Religion specialists. I mean it's basically these, you know, western, these Jamaican guys listening to reggae Bhutan and hip hop reggae, no one, I like all kind of music like someplace and across across the street from this is kinder Spiel, hidden orthodox Jewish cookie bakery and under pointed from that, it's a butcher that, um, sells live goats and chickens and here are the goats. And on the corner of the Spanish Pentecostal church, every Sunday they give it up to God with this exceedingly enthusiastic band. And I huddle at the window

Speaker 2:          18:17          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          18:18          and I think this is the best music in the world, right? Feel that deeply.

Speaker 2:          18:25          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          18:27          and then across the street from that one is a mosque.

Speaker 2:          18:39          No,

Speaker 1:          18:41          it was beautiful on the inside, across the street. There's this big building in the proprietor of this space is a gay foot fetish film producer. Show me your feet, show me your feet. Two 82nd he's got Jamaicans,

Speaker 3:          18:57          Orthodox Jews are the cookies, Hispanics, Jesus, Allah, goats in gay porn. Me, your feet all on the same block. Absolutely. For me, that's the hammer, the nails, that's the wrong gradients. Now I'm gonna take that home and I'm gonna Assemble it into a song. And when you heard his music, could you hear all that stuff? Some of it is clear than others.

Speaker 9:          19:25          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          19:25          the sounds of the neighborhood, like the reg aton music of the the West indies auto body shops. He kind of takes them and then filters it through some device that makes it sound like,

Speaker 1:          19:47          oddly enough, the day that Aaron spoke with skip was the day skip decided he's leaving New York City and he put in his notice, which I guess makes his latest album, sonic New York, kind of a dear John Letter to the city. You can hear it on our website, radio lab.org and Robert Levine's book for one about walking in time and stuff. Yeah. It's called the geography of time. More information about that too, on our website, radiolab.org also, you can subscribe to our podcasts there.
