00:00:00.247 --> 00:00:01.269
- [Voiceover] What I wanna do in this video

00:00:01.269 --> 00:00:03.267
is get some practice simplifying expressions

00:00:03.267 --> 00:00:04.948
and have some hairier numbers involved.

00:00:04.948 --> 00:00:07.189
These numbers are kind of hairy.

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:09.047
Like always, try to pause this video

00:00:09.047 --> 00:00:10.719
and see if you can simplify this expression

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.093
before I take a stab at it.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.502
All right, I'm assuming you have attempted it.

00:00:15.502 --> 00:00:16.558
Now let's look at it.

00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:23.745
We have -5.55 minus 8.55c plus 4.35c.

00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:25.748
So the first thing I wanna do is can I combine

00:00:25.748 --> 00:00:28.868
these c terms, and I definitely can.

00:00:30.148 --> 00:00:35.392
We can add -8.55c to 4.35c first,

00:00:35.392 --> 00:00:36.472
and then that would be, let's see,

00:00:36.472 --> 00:00:41.708
that would be -8.55 plus 4.35,

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:44.250
I'm just adding the coefficients,

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.386
times c, and of course, we still have

00:00:46.386 --> 00:00:48.894
that -5.55 out front.

00:00:48.894 --> 00:00:52.133
-5.55.

00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:54.164
I'll just put a plus there.

00:00:54.164 --> 00:00:56.405
Now how do we calculate -8.55

00:00:56.405 --> 00:00:58.727
plus 4.35?

00:00:58.727 --> 00:01:00.108
Well there's a couple of ways to think about it

00:01:00.108 --> 00:01:01.293
or visualize it.

00:01:01.293 --> 00:01:04.171
One way is to say well this is the same thing

00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:07.851
as the negative of 8.55

00:01:07.851 --> 00:01:10.951
minus 4.35,

00:01:10.951 --> 00:01:14.027
and 8.55 minus 4.35,

00:01:14.027 --> 00:01:15.989
let's see, eight minus four is going to be

00:01:15.989 --> 00:01:18.508
the negative, eight minus four is four,

00:01:18.508 --> 00:01:20.505
55 hundredths minus 35 hundredths

00:01:20.505 --> 00:01:21.805
is 20 hundredths.

00:01:21.805 --> 00:01:23.512
So I could write 4.20,

00:01:23.512 --> 00:01:26.310
which is really just the same thing as 4.2.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.840
So all of this can be replaced

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.326
with a -4.2.

00:01:31.326 --> 00:01:33.147
So my entire expression has simplified

00:01:33.147 --> 00:01:39.301
to -5.55, and instead of saying plus -4.2c,

00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:46.289
I can just write it as minus 4.2c,

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.985
and we're done.

00:01:46.985 --> 00:01:48.391
We can't simplify this anymore.

00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:50.410
We can't add this term that doesn't involve

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.999
the variable to this term that does involve the variable.

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:56.482
So this is about as simple as we're gonna get.

00:01:56.482 --> 00:01:58.671
So let's do another example.

00:01:58.671 --> 00:02:03.489
So here I have some more hairy numbers involved.

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:05.532
These are all expressed as fractions.

00:02:05.532 --> 00:02:10.071
And so, let's see, I have 2/5m minus 4/5 minus 3/5m.

00:02:10.071 --> 00:02:11.615
So how can I simplify?

00:02:11.615 --> 00:02:14.273
Well I could add all the m terms together.

00:02:14.273 --> 00:02:15.550
So let me just change the order.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.949
I could rewrite this as 2/5m minus 3/5m

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:22.237
minus 4/5.

00:02:22.237 --> 00:02:24.373
All I did was I changed the order.

00:02:24.373 --> 00:02:26.846
We can see that I have these two m terms.

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:28.773
I can add those two together.

00:02:28.773 --> 00:02:33.626
So this is going to be 2/5 minus 3/5

00:02:33.626 --> 00:02:39.453
times m, and then I have the -4/5

00:02:39.453 --> 00:02:41.311
still on the right hand side.

00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:44.352
Now what's 2/5 minus 3/5?

00:02:44.352 --> 00:02:46.930
Well that's gonna be -1/5.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.752
That's gonna be -1/5.

00:02:48.752 --> 00:02:54.673
So I have -1/5m minus 4/5.

00:02:54.673 --> 00:02:57.088
Minus 4/5.

00:02:57.088 --> 00:02:57.831
Now once again, I'm done.

00:02:57.831 --> 00:02:59.003
I can't simplify it anymore.

00:02:59.003 --> 00:03:01.824
I can't add this term that involves m somehow

00:03:01.824 --> 00:03:04.088
to this -4/5.

00:03:04.088 --> 00:03:06.850
So we are done here.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.091
Let's do one more.

00:03:09.091 --> 00:03:11.309
Let's do one more example.

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:12.992
So here, and this is interesting,

00:03:12.992 --> 00:03:16.311
I have a parentheses and all the rest.

00:03:16.311 --> 00:03:17.647
Like always, pause the video.

00:03:17.647 --> 00:03:20.103
See if you can simplify this.

00:03:20.103 --> 00:03:22.402
All right, let's work through it together.

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:23.702
Now the first thing that I want to do

00:03:23.702 --> 00:03:25.606
is let's distribute this two so that we

00:03:25.606 --> 00:03:27.405
just have three terms that are just

00:03:27.405 --> 00:03:29.135
being added and subtracted.

00:03:29.135 --> 00:03:31.098
So if we distribute this two,

00:03:31.098 --> 00:03:33.433
we're gonna get two times 1/5m

00:03:33.433 --> 00:03:36.312
is 2/5m.

00:03:36.312 --> 00:03:37.834
Let me make sure you see that m.

00:03:37.834 --> 00:03:38.763
M is right here.

00:03:38.763 --> 00:03:43.220
Two times -2/5 is -4/5,

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.542
and then I have plus 3/5.

00:03:45.542 --> 00:03:47.597
Now how can we simplify this more?

00:03:47.597 --> 00:03:48.793
Well I have these two terms here

00:03:48.793 --> 00:03:50.163
that don't involve the variable.

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:51.498
Those are just numbers.

00:03:51.498 --> 00:03:53.297
I can add them to each other.

00:03:53.297 --> 00:03:56.478
So I have -4/5 plus 3/5.

00:03:56.478 --> 00:03:58.811
So what's negative four plus three?

00:03:58.811 --> 00:04:00.077
That's going to be negative one.

00:04:00.077 --> 00:04:02.573
So this is going to be -1/5,

00:04:02.573 --> 00:04:04.093
what we have in yellow here.

00:04:04.093 --> 00:04:08.656
I still have the 2/5m,

00:04:08.656 --> 00:04:10.838
2/5m minus 1/5.

00:04:10.838 --> 00:04:11.616
And we're done.

00:04:11.616 --> 00:04:14.630
We've simplified that as much as we can.
