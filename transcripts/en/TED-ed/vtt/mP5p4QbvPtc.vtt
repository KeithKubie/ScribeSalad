00:00:09.758 --> 00:00:11.650
What happens after death?

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.613
Is there a restful paradise?

00:00:13.613 --> 00:00:15.476
An eternal torment?

00:00:15.476 --> 00:00:16.788
A rebirth?

00:00:16.788 --> 00:00:20.069
Or maybe just nothingness?

00:00:20.069 --> 00:00:23.569
Well, one Chinese emperor thought
that whatever the hereafter was,

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:25.661
he better bring an army.

00:00:25.661 --> 00:00:27.945
We know that because in 1974,

00:00:27.945 --> 00:00:30.449
farmers digging a well 
near their small village

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.032
stumbled upon one of the most important
finds in archeological history:

00:00:35.032 --> 00:00:38.472
vast underground chambers
surrounding that emperor's tomb,

00:00:38.472 --> 00:00:43.709
and containing more than 8,000
life-size clay soldiers ready for battle.

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:46.916
The story of the subterranean army
begins with Ying Zheng,

00:00:46.916 --> 00:00:50.931
who came to power as the king
of the Qin state at the age of 13

00:00:50.931 --> 00:00:52.864
in 246 BCE.

00:00:52.864 --> 00:00:54.343
Ambitious and ruthless,

00:00:54.343 --> 00:00:57.237
he would go on to become
Qin Shi Huangdi,

00:00:57.237 --> 00:01:01.476
the first emperor of China
after uniting its seven warring kingdoms.

00:01:01.476 --> 00:01:04.625
His 36 year reign 
saw many historic accomplishments,

00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:07.395
including a universal system
of weights and measures,

00:01:07.395 --> 00:01:11.207
a single standardized writing script
for all of China,

00:01:11.207 --> 00:01:16.345
and a defensive barrier that would
later come to be known as the Great Wall.

00:01:16.345 --> 00:01:19.145
But perhaps Qin Shi Huangdi
dedicated so much effort

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:21.261
to securing his historical legacy

00:01:21.261 --> 00:01:23.825
because he was obsessed 
with his mortality.

00:01:23.825 --> 00:01:26.843
He spent his last years
desperately employing alchemists

00:01:26.843 --> 00:01:30.194
and deploying expeditions
in search of elixirs of life

00:01:30.194 --> 00:01:32.955
that would help him achieve immortality.

00:01:32.955 --> 00:01:35.076
And as early as the first year 
of his reign,

00:01:35.076 --> 00:01:38.405
he began the construction of a massive
underground necropolis

00:01:38.405 --> 00:01:40.881
filled with monuments, artifacts,

00:01:40.881 --> 00:01:43.709
and an army to accompany him
into the next world

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:45.986
and continue his rule.

00:01:45.986 --> 00:01:49.681
This magnificent army is still standing
in precise battle formation

00:01:49.681 --> 00:01:52.222
and is split across several pits.

00:01:52.222 --> 00:01:55.147
One contains a main force
of 6,000 soldiers,

00:01:55.147 --> 00:01:57.592
each weighing several hundred pounds,

00:01:57.592 --> 00:02:03.019
a second has more than 130 war chariots
and over 600 horses,

00:02:03.019 --> 00:02:05.935
and a third houses the high command.

00:02:05.935 --> 00:02:08.503
An empty fourth pit suggests
that the grand project

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:11.333
could not be finished 
before the emperor's death.

00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:15.547
In addition, nearby chambers contain
figures of musicians and acrobats,

00:02:15.547 --> 00:02:17.653
workers and government officials,

00:02:17.653 --> 00:02:19.554
and various exotic animals,

00:02:19.554 --> 00:02:22.991
indicating that Emperor Qin
had more plans for the afterlife

00:02:22.991 --> 00:02:25.369
than simply waging war.

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:29.067
All the figurines are sculpted
from terracotta, or baked earth,

00:02:29.067 --> 00:02:31.661
a type of reddish brown clay.

00:02:31.661 --> 00:02:37.128
To construct them, multiple workshops
and reportedly over 720,000 laborers

00:02:37.128 --> 00:02:39.019
were commandeered by the emperor,

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.167
including groups of artisans who molded
each body part separately

00:02:43.167 --> 00:02:48.428
to construct statues as individual as
the real warriors in the emperor's army.

00:02:48.428 --> 00:02:50.389
They stand according to rank

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:52.535
and feature different weapons 
and uniforms,

00:02:52.535 --> 00:02:54.395
distinct hairstyles and expressions,

00:02:54.395 --> 00:02:56.807
and even unique ears.

00:02:56.807 --> 00:02:59.835
Originally, each warrior was painted
in bright colors,

00:02:59.835 --> 00:03:03.142
but their exposure to air
caused the paint to dry and flake,

00:03:03.142 --> 00:03:05.967
leaving only the terracotta base.

00:03:05.967 --> 00:03:09.568
It is for this very reason that another
chamber less than a mile away

00:03:09.568 --> 00:03:11.360
has not been excavated.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.773
This is the actual tomb of
Qin Shi Huangdi,

00:03:14.773 --> 00:03:18.491
reported to contain palaces,
precious stones and artifacts,

00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:22.864
and even rivers of mercury
flowing through mountains of bronze.

00:03:22.864 --> 00:03:26.713
But until a way can be found to expose it
without damaging the treasures inside,

00:03:26.713 --> 00:03:30.019
the tomb remains sealed.

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.660
Emperor Qin was not alone in wanting
company for his final destination.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.711
Ancient Egyptian tombs contain clay models
representing the ideal afterlife,

00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:41.577
the dead of Japan's Kofun 
period were buried

00:03:41.577 --> 00:03:43.786
with sculptures of horses and houses,

00:03:43.786 --> 00:03:46.514
and the graves of the Jaina island
off the Mexican coast

00:03:46.514 --> 00:03:48.571
are full of ceramic figurines.

00:03:48.571 --> 00:03:51.373
Fortunately, as ruthless as he was,

00:03:51.373 --> 00:03:55.076
Emperor Qin chose to have servants
and soldiers built for this purpose,

00:03:55.076 --> 00:03:58.337
rather than sacrificing living ones
to accompany him,

00:03:58.337 --> 00:04:02.192
as had been practiced in Egypt,
West Africa, Anatolia,

00:04:02.192 --> 00:04:03.956
parts of North America

00:04:03.956 --> 00:04:07.816
and even China during 
the previous Shang and Zhou dynasties.

00:04:07.816 --> 00:04:12.127
And today, people travel from all over
the world to see these stoic soldiers

00:04:12.127 --> 00:04:15.775
silently awaiting their battle orders 
for centuries to come.
