it's just being a catastrophe so ok so

it's just being a catastrophe so ok so
yes

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010
 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.300
oh well there's all sorts of reasons I

oh well there's all sorts of reasons I
 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.830
oh well there's all sorts of reasons I
mean first of all it's become socially

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840
mean first of all it's become socially
 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.680
mean first of all it's become socially
acceptable right divorce wasn't socially

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690
acceptable right divorce wasn't socially
 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.450
acceptable right divorce wasn't socially
acceptable and you can say well that's

that was pretty hard on people who

that was pretty hard on people who
 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.900
that was pretty hard on people who
wanted to get divorced it's like yeah

obviously any rule is hard on people

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820
obviously any rule is hard on people
 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.400
obviously any rule is hard on people
that break it but that doesn't mean that

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410
that break it but that doesn't mean that
 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.410
that break it but that doesn't mean that
there shouldn't be rules you know

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420
there shouldn't be rules you know
 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.060
there shouldn't be rules you know
now what rules there should be that's a

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070
now what rules there should be that's a

all the evidence suggests like if you

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180
all the evidence suggests like if you
 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.730
all the evidence suggests like if you
actually look at the evidence it's

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740
actually look at the evidence it's
 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.010
actually look at the evidence it's
absolutely clear that kids who have two

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020
absolutely clear that kids who have two
 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.320

now you know people when you tell people

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970
now you know people when you tell people
 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.430
now you know people when you tell people
that they'll tell you an anecdote about

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440
that they'll tell you an anecdote about
 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.410
that they'll tell you an anecdote about
someone they knew maybe their own parent

anecdotes are irrelevant but what's

are better apart than together and of

a scientific survey and the results of
 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.830
a scientific survey and the results of
those surveys are crystal clear you know

those surveys are crystal clear you know

the other thing that's going to happen

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360
the other thing that's going to happen
 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.699
the other thing that's going to happen
it's going to happen very soon is that

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709
it's going to happen very soon is that
 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.680
it's going to happen very soon is that
there is going to be a very very very

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690
there is going to be a very very very
 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.400
there is going to be a very very very
very large number of elderly people who

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410
very large number of elderly people who
 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.020
very large number of elderly people who
are alone and being elderly and alone

are alone and being elderly and alone
 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.290

like no family that is not something you

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300
like no family that is not something you
 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.759
like no family that is not something you
want to look forward to especially when

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769
want to look forward to especially when
 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.080
want to look forward to especially when
you start thinking that you're gonna be

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090
you start thinking that you're gonna be
 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.410
you start thinking that you're gonna be
elderly for like forty years so you know

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420
elderly for like forty years so you know
 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.650
elderly for like forty years so you know
because say say it starts around 65 I

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660
because say say it starts around 65 I
 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.000
because say say it starts around 65 I
don't know how long you guys are gonna

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010
don't know how long you guys are gonna
 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.670
don't know how long you guys are gonna
live but it's probably 95 is not an

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680
live but it's probably 95 is not an
 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.650
live but it's probably 95 is not an
unreasonable estimate and it might be

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660
unreasonable estimate and it might be
 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.020
unreasonable estimate and it might be
longer than that so because you know

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030
longer than that so because you know
 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.880
longer than that so because you know
we're adding about three months to the

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890
we're adding about three months to the
 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.140
we're adding about three months to the
total lifespan every year right that's

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150
total lifespan every year right that's
 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.449
total lifespan every year right that's
the rate of technological improvement in

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459
the rate of technological improvement in
 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.449
the rate of technological improvement in
relationship to overall mortality so you

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459
relationship to overall mortality so you
 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.460
relationship to overall mortality so you
know and that the degree to which we're

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470
know and that the degree to which we're
 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.090
know and that the degree to which we're
adding that extra lifespan is increasing

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100
adding that extra lifespan is increasing
 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.690
adding that extra lifespan is increasing
each year you know and it may hit get to

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700
each year you know and it may hit get to
 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.770
each year you know and it may hit get to
the point where we're increase

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780
the point where we're increase
 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.680
the point where we're increase
lifespan a year every year now I doubt

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690
lifespan a year every year now I doubt
 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.270
lifespan a year every year now I doubt
it because it'll probably East it'll

it because it'll probably East it'll
 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.870
it because it'll probably East it'll
