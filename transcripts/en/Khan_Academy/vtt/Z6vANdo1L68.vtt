00:00:00.328 --> 00:00:01.869
- [Instructor] Shinji commutes to work

00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:04.300
and he worries about running out of fuel.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.378
The amount of fuel he uses follows

00:00:06.378 --> 00:00:10.467
a normal distribution for
each part of his commute,

00:00:10.467 --> 00:00:14.985
but the amount of fuel he uses
on the way home varies more.

00:00:14.985 --> 00:00:18.337
The amounts of fuel he uses
for each part of the commute

00:00:18.337 --> 00:00:21.944
are also independent of each other.

00:00:21.944 --> 00:00:24.688
Here are summary statistics for the amount

00:00:24.688 --> 00:00:28.903
of fuel Shinji uses for
each part of his commute.

00:00:28.903 --> 00:00:33.254
So when he goes to work he uses
a mean of 10 liters of fuel,

00:00:33.254 --> 00:00:36.107
with a standard deviation of 1.5 liters.

00:00:36.107 --> 00:00:39.307
And on the way home, he also
has a mean of 10 liters,

00:00:39.307 --> 00:00:41.391
but there is more variation.

00:00:41.391 --> 00:00:42.473
There is more spread.

00:00:42.473 --> 00:00:46.249
He has a standard deviation of two liters.

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:51.122
Suppose that Shinji has 25
liters of fuel in his tank

00:00:51.122 --> 00:00:54.534
and he intends to drive
to work and back home.

00:00:54.534 --> 00:00:58.630
What is the probability that
Shinji runs out of fuel?

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.277
All right, this is really interesting.

00:01:00.277 --> 00:01:02.838
We have the distributions
for the amount of fuel

00:01:02.838 --> 00:01:04.592
he uses to work and to home,

00:01:04.592 --> 00:01:07.225
and they say that these
are normal distributions.

00:01:07.225 --> 00:01:08.078
They say that right over here,

00:01:08.078 --> 00:01:10.090
follows a normal distribution.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.394
But here we're talking
about the total amount

00:01:11.394 --> 00:01:15.145
of fuel he has to go
to work and to go home.

00:01:15.145 --> 00:01:18.860
So what we wanna do is come
up with a total distribution,

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.934
home and back, I guess you could say.

00:01:20.934 --> 00:01:24.996
We could say, call this work plus home.

00:01:24.996 --> 00:01:25.923
Home and back.

00:01:25.923 --> 00:01:28.052
If you have two random variables

00:01:28.052 --> 00:01:31.046
that can be described
by normal distributions

00:01:31.046 --> 00:01:34.633
and you were to define a new
random variable as their sum,

00:01:34.633 --> 00:01:36.884
the distribution of
that new random variable

00:01:36.884 --> 00:01:39.569
will still be a normal distribution

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:41.969
and its mean will be the sum of the means

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:43.863
of those other random variables.

00:01:43.863 --> 00:01:46.767
So the mean here, I'll say the mean

00:01:46.767 --> 00:01:50.934
of work plus home is going
to be equal to 20 liters.

00:01:52.355 --> 00:01:57.258
He will use a mean of 20
liters in the roundtrip.

00:01:57.258 --> 00:02:02.058
Now for the standard
deviation, from home plus work,

00:02:02.058 --> 00:02:04.214
you can't just add the standard deviations

00:02:04.214 --> 00:02:06.517
going and coming back.

00:02:06.517 --> 00:02:09.579
But because the amount
of fuel going to work

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:11.316
and the amount of fuel coming home

00:02:11.316 --> 00:02:13.851
are independent random variables,

00:02:13.851 --> 00:02:16.017
because they are
independent of each other,

00:02:16.017 --> 00:02:18.474
we can add the variances.

00:02:18.474 --> 00:02:20.051
And only because they are independent

00:02:20.051 --> 00:02:22.190
can we add the variances.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.523
So what you can say is that the variance

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.266
of the combined trip is equal to

00:02:30.113 --> 00:02:32.530
the variance of going to work

00:02:33.388 --> 00:02:36.055
plus the variance of going home.

00:02:37.116 --> 00:02:38.781
So what's the variance of going to work?

00:02:38.781 --> 00:02:42.948
Well, 1.5 squared is, so
this will be 1.5 squared,

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:46.145
and what's the variance coming home?

00:02:46.145 --> 00:02:49.534
Well, this is going to be
two squared, two squared.

00:02:49.534 --> 00:02:51.951
Well, this is 2.25 plus four,

00:02:53.083 --> 00:02:55.000
which is equal to 6.25.

00:02:55.895 --> 00:02:58.562
So the variance on the roundtrip

00:03:00.097 --> 00:03:02.226
is equal to 6.25.

00:03:02.226 --> 00:03:04.217
If I were to take the square root of that,

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:06.050
which is equal to 2.5,

00:03:07.392 --> 00:03:09.949
we can now describe
the normal distribution

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:14.116
of the roundtrip and use
that to answer the question.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.528
So we have this normal distribution

00:03:18.528 --> 00:03:22.217
that might look something like this.

00:03:22.217 --> 00:03:24.717
We know its mean is 20 liters.

00:03:26.798 --> 00:03:29.196
So this is 20 liters.

00:03:29.196 --> 00:03:30.864
And we want to know
what is the probability

00:03:30.864 --> 00:03:32.655
that Shinji runs out of fuel.

00:03:32.655 --> 00:03:33.913
Well, to run out of fuel,

00:03:33.913 --> 00:03:37.782
he would need to require
more than 25 liters of fuel.

00:03:37.782 --> 00:03:41.975
So if 25 liters of fuel
is right over here,

00:03:41.975 --> 00:03:44.392
so this is 25 liters of fuel,

00:03:45.908 --> 00:03:48.879
the scenario where Shinji runs out of fuel

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:50.612
is right over here,

00:03:50.612 --> 00:03:54.449
this is where he needs
more than 25 liters.

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:56.891
He actually has 25 liters in his tank.

00:03:56.891 --> 00:04:00.893
So how do we figure out
that area right over there?

00:04:00.893 --> 00:04:02.395
Well, we could use a z-table.

00:04:02.395 --> 00:04:04.047
We could say how many standard deviations

00:04:04.047 --> 00:04:06.380
above the mean is 25 liters?

00:04:07.283 --> 00:04:10.388
Well, it is five liters above the mean,

00:04:10.388 --> 00:04:11.397
so let me write this down.

00:04:11.397 --> 00:04:14.064
So the Z here, the Z is equal to

00:04:15.436 --> 00:04:17.769
25 minus the mean, minus 20,

00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:21.665
divided by the standard deviation for,

00:04:21.665 --> 00:04:24.899
I guess you could say this
combined normal distribution.

00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:27.638
This is two standard
deviations above the mean

00:04:27.638 --> 00:04:30.171
or a z-score of plus two.

00:04:30.171 --> 00:04:32.404
So if we look at a z-table
and we look exactly

00:04:32.404 --> 00:04:35.125
two standard deviations above the mean,

00:04:35.125 --> 00:04:38.655
that will give us this
area, the cumulative area

00:04:38.655 --> 00:04:42.280
below two standard
deviations above the mean.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.438
And then if we subtract that from one,

00:04:44.438 --> 00:04:47.247
we will get the area that we care about.

00:04:47.247 --> 00:04:50.139
So let's get our z-table out.

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.605
We care about a z-score of exactly two,

00:04:53.605 --> 00:04:56.438
so 2.00 is right over here, .9772.

00:05:00.858 --> 00:05:05.025
So that tells us that this
area right over here is 0.9772,

00:05:07.298 --> 00:05:08.756
and so that blue area,

00:05:08.756 --> 00:05:11.053
the probability that
Shinji runs out of fuel

00:05:11.053 --> 00:05:13.720
is going to be one minus 0.9772,

00:05:17.813 --> 00:05:19.891
and what is that going to be equal to?

00:05:19.891 --> 00:05:23.141
Let's see, this is going to be equal to

00:05:24.084 --> 00:05:24.917
0.0228.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:32.924
Did I do that right?

00:05:32.924 --> 00:05:34.625
I think I did that right.

00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:35.542
Yes, 0.0228

00:05:39.122 --> 00:05:41.479
is the probability that
Shinji runs out of fuel.

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:42.956
If you want to think of it as a percent,

00:05:42.956 --> 00:05:46.539
2.28% chance that he runs out of fuel.
