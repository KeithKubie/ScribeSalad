00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:04.390
No matter what happens, we can rest easy knowing
that tomorrow is a new day!

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.170
But that might not be something we’ll be
able to say in billions of years.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.139
The Earth’s spin is slowing down.

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.270
Eventually, days will get longer, and when
they do, the lack of daily dawn could be the

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.810
least of our problems.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.430
The Earth spins because of the Mars-sized
body that smashed into it when it was young.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.230
The collision set our planet spinning so fast
the day was about 6 hours long, and it simultaneously

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.160
knocked out a chunk of material that coalesced
to become the Moon.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.980
The Earth and Moon settled into a gravitational
relationship, one of the effects of which

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.560
was the Moon causing tides on the Earth.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.579
But with every tide cycle, the sloshing of
Earth’s water exerts just a little bit of

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.739
friction on the Earth’s surface, and it
slows the planet’s rotation ever so slightly.

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.360
And every time the Earth’s rotation slows
the Moon moves a little bit further away.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.290
Over time our day went from 6 to 24 hours
and the Moon retreated to its current distance

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.450
of about a quarter of a million miles.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.850
And all the while life on Earth adapted to
a planet with a 24-hour day, tides, seasons,

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.780
and an atmosphere whose wind patterns move
east to west.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.880
Tidal friction could eventually slow the Earth
significantly, and while the laws of physics

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.719
won’t allow it to stop completely, but still…
what would happen during the slow down?

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:20.409
A non-rotating Earth would have a “day”
that’s half a year of sunlight and half

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.549
a year of nighttime -- similar to tidally-locked
planets like Mercury.

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.619
This would make the days hotter and the nights
colder, especially at the poles owing to the

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.500
tilt of the Earth’s axis.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.539
This would change global wind patterns to
a north-south orientation, moving from the

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:36.829
cool equator to the hot poles.

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.569
The mid-latitudes would be the few non-extreme
places with the atmospheric density that could

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:42.639
support life.

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:45.209
That is, if there was land to live on.

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:49.459
The Earth isn’t a perfect sphere; it’s
bulbous at the equator because of its rotation.

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:54.560
As the rotation slows, the oceans would migrate
towards the poles leaving a megacontinent

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.929
around the equator.

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:59.069
And that new content would have some interesting
geology.

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.039
The layers of the Earth would all slow at
different rates, the resulting friction causing

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.990
massive earthquakes and volcanic activity
before everything stopped.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.790
And without the spinning core we’d lose
the lovely, protective, magnetic field, making

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.660
the planet and it’s new weird atmosphere
extremely vulnerable to solar radiation.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.660
TBH I would see this movie.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.830
If this global change didn’t kill off all
life on Earth, the lack of the 24-hour day

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:21.830
might.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.740
Recent studies have shown that the circadian
clock that controls all living things is actually

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.430
at the cellular level.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.410
Even species that don’t rely on sunlight,
like mussels, show more gene expression based

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.020
on the circadian cycle than the rising and
falling tides that drives their muscular activity.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.900
And of course, plants and things like plankton,
the bottom of the food chain that need sunlight

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.340
for photosynthesis, probably wouldn’t stand
a chance in the six-month-long nights.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.030
The good news is that our planet’s slowdown
is super gradual.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.020
In the last 100 years the Earth’s rotation
slowed by about 1.4 milliseconds meaning our

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.110
day got 1.4 milliseconds longer.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.240
In 2012 we added a second to the clock to
compensate.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.300
It’ll be 180 million years before our day
gets an hour longer.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.660
We’ll theoretically be able to adapt to
the time shift over that long a period, but

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.780
we’ll most likely be wiped out by some other
great extinction by then.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.430
Really, we’ll be long dead before we have
to deal with the Earth’s slowing rotation.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.640
But, still it’s fun to think about, eh?

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.560

If you want to learn a little more about circadian
cycles, I talked about how they affect your

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.980
sleep in this video right here.Fun fact, back
in the year 1820, a day on Earth was exactly

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.090
24 hours!

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.280
Today it’s 24 hours and 2 milliseconds.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.130
We have to make that up every century with
a leap second
