00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.560
We want to solve a real problem.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.450
It's better if we could
address a real pain point and

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.109
not just nice to have feature.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.570
If you can create a real value for your
users, they will be happy to pay for it.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.020
&gt;&gt; Harnessing habits
leads to more revenue.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.540
It drives a higher customer
lifetime value, and

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.189
it gives us greater
flexibility to increase prices.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.480
If you are able to
create a customer habit,

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.410
it will super charge
your monetization plan.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.140
&gt;&gt; However, it's a challenge.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.570
First, make sure users form a habit,
using your app at least once or

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.510
twice a day is a good start.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.050
Second, identify the four
aspects of your product.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.700
Triggers, actions,
rewards and investments.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.760
In the following videos,
we will see how to identify them.
