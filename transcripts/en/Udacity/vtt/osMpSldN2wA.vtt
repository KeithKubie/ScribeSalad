00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.225
By now, we've seen a ton of different kinds of functions in this course. We've

00:00:04.225 --> 00:00:08.296
seen polynomial functions, absolute value functions, square root functions and

00:00:08.296 --> 00:00:12.383
our piecewise functions, too. One thing we haven't looked at though is

00:00:12.383 --> 00:00:15.851
functions that involve division of polynomials, functions that have fractions

00:00:15.851 --> 00:00:20.660
in them. What kind of equation would a function like that have? Well, here are

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.266
a few examples. All of the functions I've written here involve taking ratios of

00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:29.733
polynomials. In other words, dividing one polynomial by another. Remember, that

00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:33.086
even constant terms are considered polynomials, too. We call them rational

00:00:33.086 --> 00:00:36.814
functions because they are ratios. There's a ton of variety in this family of

00:00:36.814 --> 00:00:41.480
functions, and their graphs might not look quite like you expect. So, here are

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.632
the graphs of the four functions that I listed up here. But now they are in a

00:00:45.632 --> 00:00:49.526
different order. Figure out which function each of these graphs represents and

00:00:49.526 --> 00:00:53.563
then write the letter of the graph next to the proper function. I know that

00:00:53.563 --> 00:00:56.683
we've never actually seen rational functions before, so to guess what each of

00:00:56.683 --> 00:00:59.659
these look like, you can plug in some different points and then see which of

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.259
the graphs they fit.
