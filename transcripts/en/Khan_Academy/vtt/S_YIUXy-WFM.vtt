00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.200
Let's say I have
some function f of x

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:09.960
that is defined as being equal
to x squared minus 6x plus 8

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.150
for all x.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.400
And what I want to do is
show that for this function

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.460
we can definitely find
a c in an interval where

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.300
the derivative at the point c
is equal to the average rate

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.834
of change over that interval.

00:00:25.834 --> 00:00:28.000
So let's give ourselves an
interval right over here.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.390
Let's say we care about the
interval between 2 and 5.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.700
And this function is definitely
continuous over this closed

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.800
interval, and it's also
differentiable over it.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.300
And it just has to
be differentiable

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.900
over the open interval, but
this is differentiable really

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.890
for all x.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.700
And so let's show
that we can find

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.210
a c that's inside the
open interval, that's

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.310
a member of the open
interval, that's

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:03.776
in the open interval such
that the derivative at c

00:01:03.776 --> 00:01:08.440
is equal to the average rate
of change over this interval.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.780
Or is equal to the slope of
the secant line between the two

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.260
endpoints of the interval.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:21.320
So it's equal to f of 5
minus f of 2 over 5 minus 2.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.460
And so I encourage you to
pause the video now and try

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.090
to find a c where
this is actually true.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.421
Well to do that, let's just
calculate what this has to be.

00:01:33.421 --> 00:01:35.670
Then let's just take the
derivative and set them equal

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.880
and we should be able
to solve for our c.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:46.640
So let's see f of 5 minus f of
2, f of 5 is, let's see, f of 5

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.670
is equal to 25 minus 30 plus 8.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.940
So that's negative 5
plus 8 is equal to 3.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.670
f of 2 is equal to
2 squared minus 12.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.370
So it's 4 minus 12 plus 8.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.260
That's going to be a 0.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.550
So this is equal to 3/3,
which is equal to 1.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.100
f prime of c needs
to be equal to 1.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.120
And so what is the
derivative of this?

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:21.870
Well let's see, f prime of
x is equal to 2x minus 6.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.850
And so we need to figure
out at what x value,

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.600
especially it has to be
in this open interval,

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.840
at what x value
is it equal to 1?

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.520
So this needs to be equal to 1.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.170
So let's add 6 to both sides.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.620
You get 2x is equal to 7.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.190
x is equal to 7/2, which is
the same thing as 3 and 1/2.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.860
So it's definitely in this
interval right over here.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.250
So we've just found
our c is equal to 7/2.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.160
And let's just graph
this to really make sure

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.040
that this makes sense.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:02.120
So this right over
here is our y-axis.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.550
And then this right
over here is our x-axis.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.270
Looks like all the
action is happening

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.660
in the first and
fourth quadrants.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.590
So that is our x-axis.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:19.500
And let's see, let's say
this is 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.410
So we already know that 2
is one of the zeroes here.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.970
So we know that our function
if we wanted to graph it,

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.210
it intersects the
x-axis right over here.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.120
And you can factor this out
as x minus 2 times x minus 4.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.985
So the other place where
our function hits 0

00:03:34.985 --> 00:03:37.740
is when x is equal
to 4 right over here.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.670
Our vertex is going to be right
in between at x is equal to 3.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.240
When x is equal to 3, let's
see, 9 minus 18 is negative 9

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.550
plus 8, so negative 1.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.620
So you have the point
3, negative 1 on it.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.220
And so that's enough
for us to graph.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.070
And we also know
at 5, we're at 3.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.390
So 1, 2, 3.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.820
So at 5, we are right over here.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.630
So over the interval
that we care about,

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.340
our graph looks
something like this.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.010
So that's the interval
that we care about.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.490
And we're saying
that we were looking

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.050
for a c whose slope is
the same as the slope

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.410
of the secant line,
same as the slope

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.990
of the line between
these two points.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.630
And if I were to just visually
look at it, I'd say well yeah,

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.500
it looks like right around
there just based on my drawing,

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.190
the slope of the tangent line
looks like it's parallel.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.890
It looks like it
has the same slope,

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.060
looks like the tangent line is
parallel to the secant line.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.500
And that looks like it's
right at 3 and 1/2 or 7/2.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.660
So it makes sense.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.990
So this right over here is
our c. c is equal to 7/2.
