00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.950
- [Instructor] In other
videos, we have already talked

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.750
about the law of demand, which tells us,

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.840
and this is probably already
somewhat intuitive for you,

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.670
that if a certain good is
currently at a higher price,

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.640
that the quantity demanded
will be quite low,

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.200
and then as the price were to decrease,

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.980
the quantity demanded would increase.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.060
So, if you were to graph demand,

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.450
and so this right over
here is our demand curve,

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.290
where price is on our vertical axis

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.070
and quantity is on our horizontal axis,

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.200
which is the standard
convention for most economists,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.860
you would have a downward
sloping demand curve.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.910
What we're going to do in this video

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.930
is dig a little bit deeper into why

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.450
we have that downward
sloping demand curve.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.490
And I know what some
of you all are saying,

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.310
well, it kind of makes common sense.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.260
As the price goes down,
I would want more of that

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.270
and so so would everyone else.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.640
But let's dig into why you
would want more of something

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.890
as the price goes down.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.350
So one category of
reasons why you might want

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.480
more of it as the price goes down,

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.750
economists will call
the substitution effect.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:05.783
Substitution,

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.110
substitution effect.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.060
And this is the idea that if we're

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.960
looking at the price verses
quantity, say, of candy,

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.520
and let's say at first the
price is right over here

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.470
at $4 and at $4 the quantity demanded

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.470
in the market would be,
let's say that is 100 units

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.780
of the candy, maybe it's
100 pounds of the candy.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.260
That if the price were to
then go to $2 for some reason,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.960
so, let's say the price is at $2,

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.190
well, then a lot of folks could say,

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.770
gee, that candy is looking a lot better

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.640
relative to other things that
I might buy with my money.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.530
So, for example, people might be picking

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.820
between candy and fruit
and maybe, at first,

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.210
they were both $4 a pound,
but now all of a sudden

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.530
if the candy is $2 a
pound, or $2 per unit,

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.800
well, then it's looking a lot
better relative to the fruit.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.740
So, some of that quantity of fruit

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.250
people would have bought, they'll say,

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.990
hey, now candy is a better deal,

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.970
I'm going to substitute
the fruit with candy.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.590
And so that's why you
have a higher quantity

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.630
of candy demanded, this might maybe

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.640
be now 250 units.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.900
Another major category
why you would expect this

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.550
downward sloping demand
curve for normal goods,

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.830
and we'll talk about
things like inferior goods

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.200
in future videos, is the income effect.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.720
Income effect, and in some ways

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.520
this might be the most intuitive.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.600
Well, if the price went from $4 to $2,

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.250
well the cost of those hundred units

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.980
would not be 1/2 as much,
it would go from $400

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.950
to $200, and so the market
would have an extra $200

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.400
to use to buy things with
and some of that extra $200,

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.450
they'll buy more candy with it,

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.760
and they might also buy
other things with that.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.610
Now, the last dimension that economists

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.300
will often talk about
for why the law of demand

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.900
is downward sloping like this,

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.960
and we talk about this in other videos,

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.880
is this idea of decreasing, decreasing

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.000
marginal utility, and that's that idea

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.210
that that first, if you're just
that first amount of candy,

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.620
there's gonna be people in the market

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.610
who take a lot of value from it.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.720
They are just addicted to candy.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.880
Their bodies are dependent on that candy,

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.200
but as soon as those folks are satiated,

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.410
that next incremental amount,
that next marginal amount,

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.840
the utility might be a little bit lower

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.670
and so, as you have more and more candy,

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.970
the marginal utility goes down,

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.900
and so that's another
way of thinking about

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.403
why we have a downward
sloping demand curve.
