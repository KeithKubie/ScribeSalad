00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.800
Talk about another perspective, in
terms of what the good guys have to do.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.250
First of all, we have to worry
about what we call prevention.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.350
Prevention really is keeping
the bad guys out of our systems.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.201
The bad guys are the threat sources,

00:00:14.201 --> 00:00:16.720
they're going to try
to attack our system.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.650
If we can keep them out,
that is prevention.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.250
Unfortunately, prevention
is not going to be 100%.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.230
If that happens, we want to detect
the compromise as quickly as possible.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.130
People talk about advanced persistent
threats, APTs that go undetected for

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.010
a long time.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.268
That means we don't have good systems to
detect that kind of malicious activity.

00:00:38.268 --> 00:00:41.140
Well, if we find out that they
have breached our systems or

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.920
compromised them,
then we have to respond to that.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.110
So response comes next, and what do we
need to do as part of the response?

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.110
We need to recover from
whatever that has happened.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.300
If data was corrupted, maybe we have
to restore it and things like that.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.980
And then remediation basically has to be

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.100
that the same attack
should not happen again.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.343
All these things is what good guys have
to do so there are really two parts.

00:01:06.343 --> 00:01:07.770
Sort of, how do you do that?

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.490
How do you do detection?

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.110
How do you do remediation?

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.170
And what exactly needs to be done?

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.780
So mechanism is sort of the how part.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.110
You want to have a flexible
set of mechanisms.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.320
So policy is always what is the way in
which we're going to address something

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.680
and what's done is through
this whole spectrum.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.590
Cyber security, again, you're not
going to be 100% secure ever but

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.520
that doesn't mean that we
leave the door wide open, so

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.960
that's what good guys have to do.
