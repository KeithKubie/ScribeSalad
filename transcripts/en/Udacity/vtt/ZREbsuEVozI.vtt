00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.630
While you are working to decrease
the time it takes to complete the form,

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.280
you've got a few options at
your disposal to help out.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.050
First off,
you could use your user's existing data.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.660
For example, if the user is logged into
your site, and you already know their

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.310
postal code because they submitted it in
a earlier form, it will be nice of you

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.610
to pre-fill the postal code field with
a known one like you could see here.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.500
Another option is to access
the geolocation in order to

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.530
determine the postal code.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.110
This works even if
the user isn't logged in.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.900
Check the instructor notes for
more details.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.660
This is great because
with almost no efforts,

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.350
you saved your users time and
you're one field closer to completion.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.680
In the date example,
here it's three fields closer.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.369
Great, no?

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:54.364
Another easy option is to enable
users automatically fill fields

00:00:54.364 --> 00:00:56.201
by enabling autofill.

00:00:56.201 --> 00:01:01.330
You will dive deep into autofill

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.019
attribute by enabling
Auto Complete in the next lesson.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.280
But before thinking about our
attributes on your inputs,

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.210
I want you to think about
the input elements themselves.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.930
Just look how powerful autofill can be.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.920
I'm just start typing here and

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.910
when I'm choosing,
it's automatically fill the form.
