00:00:00.075 --> 00:00:01.981
- [Voiceover] What I want
to talk about in this video,

00:00:01.981 --> 00:00:04.788
is the notion of Arc Measure,

00:00:04.788 --> 00:00:06.946
when we're dealing with circles.

00:00:06.946 --> 00:00:09.175
As we'll see, sometimes when you see

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:10.499
something like arc measure,

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:12.356
you might think it's the length of an arc,

00:00:12.356 --> 00:00:14.771
but arc length is
actually a different idea.

00:00:14.771 --> 00:00:16.884
So we will compare these two things.

00:00:16.884 --> 00:00:20.297
Arc length to arc measure.

00:00:20.297 --> 00:00:23.269
So arc measure, all that is

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:24.685
is just a fancy way of saying,

00:00:24.685 --> 00:00:27.077
if I have a circle right over here,

00:00:27.077 --> 00:00:29.933
this is my best attempt
at drawing a circle.

00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:32.557
I have a circle here.

00:00:32.557 --> 00:00:37.131
The center of the circle,
let's call that point O,

00:00:37.131 --> 00:00:39.731
and let me put some
other points over here.

00:00:39.731 --> 00:00:43.725
So let's say that this is point A,

00:00:43.725 --> 00:00:46.837
let's say this is point B,

00:00:46.837 --> 00:00:51.178
and let's say this is
point C right over here.

00:00:51.178 --> 00:00:53.222
And let's say that I have,

00:00:53.222 --> 00:00:57.053
let's say the central
angle, right over here,

00:00:57.053 --> 00:00:59.166
cause it includes the
center of the circle,

00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:02.114
so the central angle, angle AOB.

00:01:02.114 --> 00:01:07.078
Let's say it has a measure of 120 degrees.

00:01:09.638 --> 00:01:11.077
And if someone were to say,

00:01:11.077 --> 00:01:14.345
what is the measure of arc AB?

00:01:14.769 --> 00:01:16.324
So, let me write that down.

00:01:16.324 --> 00:01:17.600
The measure.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.476
So, if someone were to say
what is the measure of arc AB,

00:01:22.476 --> 00:01:23.916
and they'd write it like this,

00:01:23.916 --> 00:01:27.444
so that's referring to
arc AB right over here.

00:01:27.444 --> 00:01:31.414
It's the minor arc, so there's
two ways to connect AB,

00:01:31.414 --> 00:01:33.481
you could connect it right over here,

00:01:33.481 --> 00:01:35.408
this is the shorter distance,

00:01:35.408 --> 00:01:36.942
or you can go the other way around,

00:01:36.942 --> 00:01:39.843
which would be what you'd
consider the major arc.

00:01:39.843 --> 00:01:41.840
Now, if someone's
referring to the major arc,

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.556
they would say arc ACB.

00:01:44.556 --> 00:01:46.809
So when you're given just two letters,

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:49.480
you assume it's the shortest
distance between the two.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.661
You assume that it is the minor arc.

00:01:51.661 --> 00:01:53.473
In order to specify the major arc,

00:01:53.473 --> 00:01:55.423
you would give the third letter,

00:01:55.423 --> 00:01:57.373
to go the long way around.

00:01:57.373 --> 00:02:00.646
So the measure of arc AB, and sometimes

00:02:00.646 --> 00:02:02.639
you'll see it with
parenthesis right over here,

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:05.797
all this is, this is the
same thing as the measure

00:02:05.797 --> 00:02:10.185
of the central angle
that intercepts that arc.

00:02:10.185 --> 00:02:12.670
Well, the central angle
that intercepts that arc

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.315
has a measure of 120 degrees.

00:02:16.315 --> 00:02:20.425
So this is just going to be 120 degrees.

00:02:20.425 --> 00:02:22.004
Now, some of y'all might be saying,

00:02:22.004 --> 00:02:23.514
well, what about the major arc?

00:02:23.514 --> 00:02:24.813
Well, let's write that.

00:02:24.813 --> 00:02:27.274
So if we're talking about arc ACB,

00:02:27.274 --> 00:02:29.271
so we're going the other way around,

00:02:29.271 --> 00:02:31.548
so this is major arc.

00:02:31.548 --> 00:02:36.504
So what is the measure of arc ACB,

00:02:36.864 --> 00:02:38.652
once again we're using three letters,

00:02:38.652 --> 00:02:41.067
so that we're specifying the major arc.

00:02:41.067 --> 00:02:45.130
Well, this angle, this
central angle right over here,

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.868
to go all the way around
the circle is 360 degrees.

00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:52.955
So this is going to be
the 360 minus the 120

00:02:52.955 --> 00:02:54.627
that we're not including.

00:02:54.627 --> 00:02:57.273
So 360 degrees minus 120 is going to be,

00:02:57.273 --> 00:03:01.592
is going to be 240 degrees.

00:03:01.592 --> 00:03:06.556
So the measure of this angle
right over here is 240 degrees,

00:03:06.974 --> 00:03:11.803
so the measure of this arc,

00:03:11.803 --> 00:03:14.055
I have to be careful not
to say length of that arc,

00:03:14.055 --> 00:03:16.192
the measure of this arc
is going to be the same

00:03:16.192 --> 00:03:18.026
as the measure of the central angle.

00:03:18.026 --> 00:03:21.694
It's going to be 240 degrees.

00:03:24.424 --> 00:03:27.476
These arc measures are
going to be the case

00:03:27.476 --> 00:03:29.659
regardless of the size of the circle,

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:31.376
and that's where the
difference starts to be

00:03:31.376 --> 00:03:33.513
from arc measure to arc length.

00:03:33.513 --> 00:03:36.764
So, I could have two circles,

00:03:36.764 --> 00:03:38.900
so this circle right over here

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.033
and that circle right over here,

00:03:42.033 --> 00:03:45.609
and as long as the central
angle that intercepts the arc

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:47.885
has the same degree measure,

00:03:47.885 --> 00:03:52.885
so let's say that that degree
measure is the same as,

00:03:53.025 --> 00:03:54.357
these are central angles,

00:03:54.357 --> 00:03:55.844
so we're assuming the vertex of the angle

00:03:55.844 --> 00:03:57.284
is the center of the circle.

00:03:57.284 --> 00:03:59.559
As long as these two are the same,

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:02.253
these two central angles
have the same degree measure,

00:04:02.253 --> 00:04:05.457
then the arc measures, then
the corresponding arc measures

00:04:05.457 --> 00:04:07.012
are going to be the same.

00:04:07.012 --> 00:04:10.402
But clearly, these two
arc lengths are different.

00:04:10.402 --> 00:04:12.260
The arc length is not going to depend

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.163
only on the measure of the central angle,

00:04:15.163 --> 00:04:16.974
the arc length is going to depend

00:04:16.974 --> 00:04:20.132
on the size of the actual circle.

00:04:20.132 --> 00:04:22.825
Arc measure is only dependent

00:04:22.825 --> 00:04:26.052
on the measure of the central angle

00:04:26.052 --> 00:04:28.885
that intercepts that arc.

00:04:28.885 --> 00:04:33.087
So your maximum arc measure
is going to be 360 degrees.

00:04:33.087 --> 00:04:36.733
Your minimum arc measure is
going to be zero degrees.

00:04:36.733 --> 00:04:39.984
It's measured in degrees,
not in units of length

00:04:39.984 --> 00:04:42.561
that arc length would be measured in.

00:04:42.561 --> 00:04:44.278
So, let me write this down.

00:04:44.278 --> 00:04:46.275
This only depends...

00:04:46.275 --> 00:04:49.387
So, this is what's going to drive this

00:04:49.387 --> 00:04:54.387
is the measure of central
angle, central angle,

00:04:57.798 --> 00:05:00.045
that intercepts the arc.

00:05:00.747 --> 00:05:05.747
That intercepts, intercepts the arc.

00:05:06.757 --> 00:05:08.684
When you talk about arc length,

00:05:08.684 --> 00:05:10.797
yes, it's going to be
dependent on the angle,

00:05:10.797 --> 00:05:12.747
but it's also dependent,
it's going to be dependent

00:05:12.747 --> 00:05:14.233
on the measure of that central angle

00:05:14.233 --> 00:05:16.875
plus the size of the circle.

00:05:16.875 --> 00:05:19.452
Size of the circle.

00:05:19.452 --> 00:05:21.519
You're actually talking
about a length now,

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:22.935
when you're talking about arc length.

00:05:22.935 --> 00:05:25.298
While here, you're talking
about a degree measure.
