00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.060
CHRISTOPHER EISGRUBER:
Higher education

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.360
today is probably more important
than it has been at any time

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.230
in the past.


00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.160
But at the same
time, universities

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.630
are facing a wide
range of challenges

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.910
and having to satisfy diverse
group of constituencies.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.390
What is online
education going to mean

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.240
for colleges and universities?


00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.660
How are colleges
and universities

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.550
going to deal with budget
pressures around the world?

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.610
And these issues are
arising at a time

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.420
when universities
are simultaneously

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.000
facing different
pressures but interacting

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.260
around the world more than
they ever have before.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:01:03.770

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.020
GIDEON ROSEN: One of the
great opportunities presented

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.310
by the forum is not
so much to assess

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.440
the state of online courses
and higher education,

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.770
but to get a clearer view
of what sorts of questions

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.370
we want to ask.


00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.940
The most interesting thing
about the online revolution

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.940
in education-- if that's
what it's going to be--

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.610
is that we don't know
what kind of threat

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.280
or what kind of
opportunity it presents.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.490
CECILIA ROUSE: It can
certainly help increase access.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.230
That we understand.


00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.510
Can we maintain quality
at the same time,

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.180
I think is an open question.


00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.910
And I think whether
it really helps

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.110
to slow the increases in cost,
is an open question as well.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.770
I think Princeton
can certainly play

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.940
a very important role
in that endeavor.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.560
GIDEON ROSEN: It is
now possible for us

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.060
to see not only how we teach,
but how our colleagues teach.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.410
And how our colleagues in other
very different universities

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.160
in the United States teach, how
our colleagues around the world

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.660
teach.


00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.860
And for them to see
how we do what we do.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.800
CECILIA ROUSE: This issue of
how do we maintain and possibly

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.900
improve access while
maintaining and improving

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.830
quality and keeping
it affordable

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.520
is the challenge for higher
education of our time.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.020
The commitment to higher
education-- the fact that

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.620
when an individual attends a
post-secondary institution--

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.750
not only is the benefit
to that individual,

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.150
but all of us in society
benefit from having

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.500
more highly educated
individuals and workers.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.970
And therefore, we need
to also be subsidizing

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.310
and to help our students go
through those institutions.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.640
CHRISTOPHER EISGRUBER: I'm
very grateful to William Fung

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.530
for enabling Princeton to host
the Fung Global Forum this year

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.700
and annually.


00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.010
Each year, the forum
addresses an issue

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.480
of major significance-- not
only to academics, but also

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.410
to policy makers in the world.


00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.440
I think this year's
event in Paris

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.730
will be a terrific
opportunity to bring together

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.950
a wide variety of people on an
issue of critical importance.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:17.270
