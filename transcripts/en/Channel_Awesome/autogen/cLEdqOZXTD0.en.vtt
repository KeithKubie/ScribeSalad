00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.230
at the very least figure out what's
going on and I definitely didn't see

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240
going on and I definitely didn't see
 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.390

okay well now what's going on well it's
 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.130
okay well now what's going on well it's
the whole portal thing um but yeah I

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140
the whole portal thing um but yeah I
 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.750
the whole portal thing um but yeah I
think this whole thing is just like a

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760
think this whole thing is just like a
 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.880
think this whole thing is just like a
really cool showcase for the

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890
really cool showcase for the
 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:40.930
really cool showcase for the
nightosphere

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940
nightosphere
 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.720
nightosphere
it looks great like there's this really

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730
it looks great like there's this really
 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.990
it looks great like there's this really
long shot just doing nothing but showing

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000
long shot just doing nothing but showing
 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.880
long shot just doing nothing but showing
off this world and all the weird

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890
off this world and all the weird
 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.240
off this world and all the weird
creations and even kind of how it works

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250
creations and even kind of how it works
 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.800
creations and even kind of how it works
in a sense because everything works a

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810
in a sense because everything works a
 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.420
in a sense because everything works a
little differently like a guy can get

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430
little differently like a guy can get
 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.830
little differently like a guy can get
zapped and he can turn to a bunch of

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840
zapped and he can turn to a bunch of
 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.300
zapped and he can turn to a bunch of
little versions of himself there's a

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310
little versions of himself there's a
 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.790
little versions of himself there's a
cloud that goes around zapping people on

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800
cloud that goes around zapping people on
 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.100
cloud that goes around zapping people on
asking questions there there's a river

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110
asking questions there there's a river
 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.110
asking questions there there's a river
filled with like people that you find

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120
filled with like people that you find
 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.000
filled with like people that you find
out is a line as a house the line where

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010
out is a line as a house the line where
 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.740
out is a line as a house the line where
I don't know just serve directs itself

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750
I don't know just serve directs itself
 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.170
I don't know just serve directs itself
it's I like these I'm just I'm just like

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180
it's I like these I'm just I'm just like
 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.020
it's I like these I'm just I'm just like
rolling on top of them yeah I like these

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030
rolling on top of them yeah I like these
 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.600
rolling on top of them yeah I like these
worlds where they can kind of create

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610
worlds where they can kind of create
 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.190
worlds where they can kind of create
sort of their own backwards

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200
sort of their own backwards
 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.280
sort of their own backwards
logic you know and it's so you have to

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.290
logic you know and it's so you have to
 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.110
logic you know and it's so you have to
sort of learn their rules which I like

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120
sort of learn their rules which I like
 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.750
sort of learn their rules which I like
too but there I know it seems like a

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760
too but there I know it seems like a
 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.130
too but there I know it seems like a
world where it's like yeah these are

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140
world where it's like yeah these are
 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.110
world where it's like yeah these are
different rules but they kind of follow

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120
different rules but they kind of follow
 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.270
different rules but they kind of follow
them too it's I can't explain it like

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280
them too it's I can't explain it like
 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.210
them too it's I can't explain it like
half the creatures in this are exactly

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220
half the creatures in this are exactly
 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.350
half the creatures in this are exactly
then actually have creatures like that

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360
then actually have creatures like that
 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.290
then actually have creatures like that
one really seem like its sides and could

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300
one really seem like its sides and could
 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.510
one really seem like its sides and could
talk mentally and you're just you're

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520
talk mentally and you're just you're
 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.770
talk mentally and you're just you're
just kind of earring out how this place

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780
just kind of earring out how this place
 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.330
just kind of earring out how this place
works and everybody's grossed out by the

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340
works and everybody's grossed out by the
 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.390
works and everybody's grossed out by the
banana but you don't know why I don't

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400
banana but you don't know why I don't
 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.950
banana but you don't know why I don't
weird things like that are just sort of

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960
weird things like that are just sort of
 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.870
weird things like that are just sort of
intriguing it makes it seem more like a

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880
intriguing it makes it seem more like a
 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.770
intriguing it makes it seem more like a
real world

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780
real world
 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.840
real world
whoa which I like there's a lot of like

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:52.850
whoa which I like there's a lot of like
 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.150
whoa which I like there's a lot of like
shows or like movies or what now where

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160
shows or like movies or what now where
 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.920
shows or like movies or what now where
you go to some alternate world where

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930
you go to some alternate world where
 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.660
you go to some alternate world where
it's bizarre and strange and that's all

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:58.670
it's bizarre and strange and that's all
 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.400
it's bizarre and strange and that's all
it is yeah it just kind of looks weird

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410
it is yeah it just kind of looks weird
 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.290
it is yeah it just kind of looks weird
it looks weird everything else operates

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300
it looks weird everything else operates
 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.270
it looks weird everything else operates
like our world it's it's not even that

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280
like our world it's it's not even that
 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.420
like our world it's it's not even that
like this one it's got its own rules in

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430
like this one it's got its own rules in
 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.810
like this one it's got its own rules in
its laws and everything and if the line

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:10.820
its laws and everything and if the line
 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.820
its laws and everything and if the line
it governs itself you know it's kind of

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830
it governs itself you know it's kind of
 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.650
it governs itself you know it's kind of
like that I've seen other things where

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660
like that I've seen other things where
 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:15.820
like that I've seen other things where
like these alternate worlds you go to

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830
like these alternate worlds you go to
 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.320
like these alternate worlds you go to
our just bizarre for the sake of being

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.330
our just bizarre for the sake of being
 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.630
our just bizarre for the sake of being
bizarre this one seems to have a little

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:19.640
bizarre this one seems to have a little
 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.210
bizarre this one seems to have a little
bit more life behind it there's this

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220
bit more life behind it there's this
 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.800
bit more life behind it there's this
going on here this is going on here but

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:23.810
going on here this is going on here but
 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.570
going on here this is going on here but
it's going on kind of for a reason it

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580
it's going on kind of for a reason it
 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.900
it's going on kind of for a reason it
seems yeah it's light and it's captured

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:28.910
seems yeah it's light and it's captured
 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.690
seems yeah it's light and it's captured
like even the banan thing like Nana I

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:31.700
like even the banan thing like Nana I
 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:32.890
like even the banan thing like Nana I
don't know why

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:32.900
don't know why
 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.750
don't know why
they're all grossed out by the banal but

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:34.760
they're all grossed out by the banal but
 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.220
they're all grossed out by the banal but
you know there's a legit reason it's a

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:36.230
you know there's a legit reason it's a
 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.440
you know there's a legit reason it's a
reason everybody understands and it's

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:38.450
reason everybody understands and it's
 

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.300
reason everybody understands and it's
kind of the norm there it's just trying

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:40.310
kind of the norm there it's just trying
 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.280
kind of the norm there it's just trying
to figure out what that is yeah so it's

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:42.290
to figure out what that is yeah so it's
 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:43.660
to figure out what that is yeah so it's
like there is a logic it's just trying

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:43.670
like there is a logic it's just trying
 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.730
like there is a logic it's just trying
to figure out that logic it's got its

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:45.740
to figure out that logic it's got its
 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.500
to figure out that logic it's got its
own internal logic that it actually

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:47.510
own internal logic that it actually
 

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:51.130
own internal logic that it actually
follows and it's bizarre but not just

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:51.140
follows and it's bizarre but not just
 

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.500
follows and it's bizarre but not just
bizarre for the sake of being bizarre

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:53.510
bizarre for the sake of being bizarre
 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.620
bizarre for the sake of being bizarre
yeah they're sort of like there is a

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:56.630
yeah they're sort of like there is a
 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:58.030
yeah they're sort of like there is a
rhyme and reason it's just try to figure

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:58.040
rhyme and reason it's just try to figure
 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.980
rhyme and reason it's just try to figure
out what that rhyme and reason is well

00:06:59.980 --> 00:06:59.990
out what that rhyme and reason is well
 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:01.330
out what that rhyme and reason is well
like the guy who's guarding them in the

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:01.340
like the guy who's guarding them in the
 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.950
like the guy who's guarding them in the
cellars like well time to everyone out

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960
cellars like well time to everyone out
 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.030
cellars like well time to everyone out
everyone out there like what are you

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:04.040
everyone out there like what are you
 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.340
everyone out there like what are you
talking about well no one else is coming

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:06.350
talking about well no one else is coming
 

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.380
talking about well no one else is coming
so and he leaves and then just the

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:08.390
so and he leaves and then just the
 

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.270
so and he leaves and then just the
monsters have been imprisoned are just

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:10.280
monsters have been imprisoned are just
 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.170
monsters have been imprisoned are just
kind of standing around doing nothing

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:11.180
kind of standing around doing nothing
 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.550
kind of standing around doing nothing
he's like well maybe these just don't

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560
he's like well maybe these just don't
 

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.720
he's like well maybe these just don't
the smart ones

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:13.730
the smart ones
 

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:15.370
the smart ones
maybe there's a dummy ones ever do that

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:15.380
maybe there's a dummy ones ever do that
 

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.100
maybe there's a dummy ones ever do that
again or they seem to be just the dumb

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:18.110
again or they seem to be just the dumb
 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.250
again or they seem to be just the dumb
ones so again it's this internal logic

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:21.260
ones so again it's this internal logic
 

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:27.610
ones so again it's this internal logic
works like that doesn't not gonna go

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:27.620
works like that doesn't not gonna go
 

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.430
works like that doesn't not gonna go
very far yeah and there's not much

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:30.440
very far yeah and there's not much
 

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.360
very far yeah and there's not much
concern about a yeah so it's I yeah so

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:34.370
concern about a yeah so it's I yeah so
 

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.820
concern about a yeah so it's I yeah so
it's not just the look of the world I

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:36.830
it's not just the look of the world I
 

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:41.620
it's not just the look of the world I
kind of like the actual flow yeah just

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:41.630
kind of like the actual flow yeah just
 

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.180
kind of like the actual flow yeah just
sort of the flow and the layout of how

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:43.190
sort of the flow and the layout of how
 

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.060
sort of the flow and the layout of how
they run things you know even if I don't

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:46.070
they run things you know even if I don't
 

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.950
they run things you know even if I don't
fully understand that you can tell they

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:47.960
fully understand that you can tell they
 

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.500

show with this like I'm all for it every
every design in this I felt like I was

00:08:52.499 --> 00:08:52.509
every design in this I felt like I was
 

00:08:52.509 --> 00:08:53.939
every design in this I felt like I was
watching like spirited away or something

00:08:53.939 --> 00:08:53.949
watching like spirited away or something
 

00:08:53.949 --> 00:08:55.470

I even that one tall guy like in the
 

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.249
I even that one tall guy like in the
middle of it you know it's like his

00:09:02.249 --> 00:09:02.259
middle of it you know it's like his
 

00:09:02.259 --> 00:09:04.740

love it actually if he knows his mouth
 

00:09:12.819 --> 00:09:13.920
love it actually if he knows his mouth
is a plus

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:13.930
is a plus
 

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:16.410
is a plus
yes are like anything and if you notice

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:16.420
yes are like anything and if you notice
 

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.569
yes are like anything and if you notice
when he talks he's got the 17th here

00:09:18.569 --> 00:09:18.579
when he talks he's got the 17th here
 

00:09:18.579 --> 00:09:19.860
when he talks he's got the 17th here
here but he also has a set of teeth

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:19.870
here but he also has a set of teeth
 

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:22.410
here but he also has a set of teeth
going this alright on the side - yeah as

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:22.420
going this alright on the side - yeah as
 

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.329
going this alright on the side - yeah as
awesome I don't like that it's a great

00:09:24.329 --> 00:09:24.339
awesome I don't like that it's a great
 

00:09:24.339 --> 00:09:26.460
awesome I don't like that it's a great
design why what I sort of know is to

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:26.470
design why what I sort of know is to
 

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:30.240
design why what I sort of know is to
watching the Hudson design is that you

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:30.250
watching the Hudson design is that you
 

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:32.280
watching the Hudson design is that you
know his mouth is sideways too but isn't

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:32.290
know his mouth is sideways too but isn't
 

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:34.139
know his mouth is sideways too but isn't
just talking like this I realized that

00:09:34.139 --> 00:09:34.149
just talking like this I realized that
 

00:09:34.149 --> 00:09:36.960
just talking like this I realized that
if you look at it kinda this way it like

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:36.970
if you look at it kinda this way it like
 

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:38.429
if you look at it kinda this way it like
the lip movements are sort of the same

00:09:38.429 --> 00:09:38.439
the lip movements are sort of the same
 

00:09:38.439 --> 00:09:39.809
the lip movements are sort of the same
it's like a normal cartoon characters

00:09:39.809 --> 00:09:39.819
it's like a normal cartoon characters
 

00:09:39.819 --> 00:09:41.129
it's like a normal cartoon characters
lip movements like if it's gonna make it

00:09:41.129 --> 00:09:41.139
lip movements like if it's gonna make it
 

00:09:41.139 --> 00:09:42.840
lip movements like if it's gonna make it
oh it'll make it oh serve in the middle

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:42.850
oh it'll make it oh serve in the middle
 

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:44.519
oh it'll make it oh serve in the middle
of the recipe straight it's just sight

00:09:44.519 --> 00:09:44.529
of the recipe straight it's just sight
 

00:09:44.529 --> 00:09:47.550
of the recipe straight it's just sight
yes so it's not just going like this or

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:47.560
yes so it's not just going like this or
 

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.230
yes so it's not just going like this or
like a sideways muffin edge or the is

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:49.240
like a sideways muffin edge or the is
 

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.090
like a sideways muffin edge or the is
forming lip movements it's just to the

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:51.100
forming lip movements it's just to the
 

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:52.980
forming lip movements it's just to the
side yeah let you know I actually drew

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:52.990
side yeah let you know I actually drew
 

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:55.110
side yeah let you know I actually drew
it normally and then just turned it yeah

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:55.120
it normally and then just turned it yeah
 

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.850
it normally and then just turned it yeah
and that's they don't have to do that I

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:56.860
and that's they don't have to do that I
 

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.499
and that's they don't have to do that I
mean that's just a nice little detail

00:09:58.499 --> 00:09:58.509
mean that's just a nice little detail
 

00:09:58.509 --> 00:10:02.429
mean that's just a nice little detail
they throw in there again just - you

00:10:02.429 --> 00:10:02.439
they throw in there again just - you
 

00:10:02.439 --> 00:10:04.319
they throw in there again just - you
don't always notice it but you can kind

00:10:04.319 --> 00:10:04.329
don't always notice it but you can kind
 

00:10:04.329 --> 00:10:06.449
don't always notice it but you can kind
of feel it it kind of does rub off those

00:10:06.449 --> 00:10:06.459
of feel it it kind of does rub off those
 

00:10:06.459 --> 00:10:08.819
of feel it it kind of does rub off those
little details and I've been saying that

00:10:08.819 --> 00:10:08.829
little details and I've been saying that
 

00:10:08.829 --> 00:10:10.679
little details and I've been saying that
kind of since the get-go just it's
