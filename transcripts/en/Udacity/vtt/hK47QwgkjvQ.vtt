00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We saw that fishing with the harvest rate that's equal

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
to the maximum sustainable yield is pretty dangerous.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Let's try to come up with something that's safer--

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
for instance, ramping up the harvest rate over the course of time.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We don't harvest during the first four years and after a time of 6 years,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
we're not using the maximum sustainable yield but we're using something that's a little smaller

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
0.8 times the maximum sustainable yield.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The 0.8 would be a safety factor and between 4 years and 6 years, let's have a linear ramp.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Now implement this ramp in the computer model. The forward Euler's method is already in place.

00:00:43.000 --> 99:59:59.000
You just have to provide the code that computes the harvest rate, which is used here.
