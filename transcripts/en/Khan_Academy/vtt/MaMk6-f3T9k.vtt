00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:06.060
We're told this table shows
equivalent ratios to 24 to 40.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.820
Fill in the missing values.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.450
And they write the ratio
24 to 40 right over here.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.720
24-- when the numerator is
24, the denominator is 40.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.631
So in that way, you
could think of 24/40.

00:00:16.631 --> 00:00:18.630
But then they want us to
write equivalent ratios

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.520
where we have to fill
in different blanks

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.090
over here-- here
in the denominator

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.370
and here in the numerator.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.994
And there's a bunch of ways that
we could actually tackle this.

00:00:25.994 --> 00:00:27.994
But maybe the easiest is
to start with the ratio

00:00:27.994 --> 00:00:29.535
that they gave us,
where they gave us

00:00:29.535 --> 00:00:31.410
both the numerator
and the denominator,

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.710
and then move from there.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.640
So for example, if we look
at this one right over here,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.950
the numerator is 12.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.220
It is half of the 24.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.310
So the denominator is also going
to be half of the denominator

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.810
here.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.460
It's going to be half of 40.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.000
So we could stick a
20 right over there.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.500
And then we could go up here.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.960
If you compare the 3 to
the 12, to go from 12 to 3,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.460
you have to divide by 4.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.474
So in the numerator,
you're dividing by 4.

00:00:56.474 --> 00:00:58.640
So in the denominator, you
also want to divide by 4.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.889
So 20 divided by 4 is 5.

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:03.430
And then we have
one more to fill in,

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.881
this numerator right over here.

00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:07.380
And we see from the denominator,
we doubled the denominator.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.880
We went from 40 to 80.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.810
So we would double
the numerator as well,

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.240
and so you would get 48.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.370
And what we just did here is we
wrote four equivalent ratios.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.730
The ratio 3 to 5 or 3/5 is
the same thing as 12 to 20,

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.830
is the same thing as 24 to 40,
is the same thing as 48 to 80.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.800
Let's make sure we
got the right answer.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.470
Let's do a couple more of these.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.280
The following table shows
equivalent fractions to 27/75.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.130
So then they wrote all of the
different equivalent fractions.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.180
This table shows ratios
equivalent to 18/55.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.930
Fair enough.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.280
All right, so these are
all equivalent to 27/75.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.910
These are all equivalent
to 18/55, so all of these.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:01.480
Which fraction is
greater, 27/75 or 18/55?

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.100
So this is an interesting thing.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.190
What we want to do-- because
you look at these two things.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.390
And you're like,
well, I don't know.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.990
Their denominators
are different.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.740
How do I compare them?

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.000
And the best way that I
can think of comparing them

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.950
is look at a point where you're
getting an equivalent fraction.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.646
And either the numerators
are going to be the same,

00:02:18.646 --> 00:02:20.520
or the denominators are
going to be the same.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.800
So let's see if there's
any situation here.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:30.300
So you have this situation
where we see 27/75 is 54/150.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.140
And over here, we see
that 18/55 is 54--

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.190
and this 54 jumped
out at me because it's

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.100
the same numerator-- over 165.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.920
And that makes the
comparison much easier.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.520
What is smaller?

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.716
54/150 or 54/165?

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.150
Well, if you have
the same numerator,

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.630
having a larger denominator
will make the number smaller.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.790
So 54/165 is smaller than
54/150, which tells us

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.802
that 18/55 is
smaller than 27/75.

00:03:03.802 --> 00:03:05.010
So let's see, which of these?

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.030
So this is saying that
27/75 is greater than 18/55,

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.460
and that is absolutely right.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.220
And let's do one more of these.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.840
Lunara's friends
are running a race.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.910
Each of them runs at a constant
speed starting at time 0.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.950
Which of these tables might
show the distances one

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.337
of Lunara's friends
traveled over time?

00:03:29.337 --> 00:03:30.420
So they're running a race.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.110
Each of them runs at a constant
speed starting at time 0.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.560
So table 1-- so
distance run in meters.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.550
So they're running
at a constant speed.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.340
So really, the ratio
between distance and time

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.770
should be constant throughout
all of these possible tables.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.910
So here you have
a ratio of 3 to 2.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.290
If you triple the distance,
we're tripling the time.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.090
If you multiply
the distance by 5,

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.400
we're multiplying the time by 5.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.850
So table 1 seems
completely reasonable.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:03.620
Let's keep going.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.280
Table 2-- 11 to 4
and then 12 to 5.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.720
Here, it's just
incrementing by 1,

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.210
but the ratios are not the same.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.170
11 to 4 is not the
same thing as 12 to 5.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.589
So we're not going to be able
to-- this right over here

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:23.100
is not a legitimate table.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.210
Table 3-- so 1 to 1.

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.980
Then when you double the
distance, we double the time.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.180
When you triple the
distance from 1,

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.490
you didn't triple the time.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.050
So table 3 doesn't seem
to make sense, either.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.480
Table 4-- so 14 to 10.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.530
So that's the same
thing as-- let's see,

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.920
that's the same ratio as, if
we were to divide by 2, as

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.280
7 to 5 ratio.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.170
If we divide both of these by
3, this is also a 7 to 5 ratio.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.140
And if you divide both of these
by 7, this is also a 7 to 5

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.980
ratio.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:01.130
So table 4 seems like a
completely reasonable scenario.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.740
And we can check our
answer, and it is.
