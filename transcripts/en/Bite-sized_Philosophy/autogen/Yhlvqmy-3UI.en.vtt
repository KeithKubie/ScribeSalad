that's the right way of thinking about
it

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 align:start position:0%
it
 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
it
there's<00:01:07.650><c> a</c><00:01:07.740><c> there's</c><00:01:08.490><c> an</c><00:01:08.790><c> implicit</c><00:01:09.330><c> potential</c>

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 align:start position:0%
there's a there's an implicit potential

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 align:start position:0%
for havoc and that's really necessary
 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.320 align:start position:0%
for havoc and that's really necessary
it's<00:01:13.860><c> one</c><00:01:14.220><c> of</c><00:01:14.340><c> the</c><00:01:14.460><c> things</c><00:01:14.700><c> that</c><00:01:14.909><c> gives</c><00:01:15.119><c> people</c>

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 align:start position:0%
it's one of the things that gives people
 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
it's one of the things that gives people

self respect this is an interesting
 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
self respect this is an interesting
