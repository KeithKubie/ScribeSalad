00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.766
The reason is sickle cell anemia is some frequent

00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:07.550
in subsaharan Africa is because the allele makes the

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.764
person partially resistant to malaria which is endemic to

00:00:11.764 --> 00:00:14.523
the region. Now if we move to another region

00:00:14.523 --> 00:00:17.578
like North America, where there isn't a prevalence of

00:00:17.578 --> 00:00:20.893
malaria, we've now changed the selection pressure and the

00:00:20.893 --> 00:00:23.493
sickle cell allele is deleted out over over time

00:00:23.493 --> 00:00:26.063
so that it occurs at a much lower frequency.

00:00:26.063 --> 00:00:28.268
You recall from just a couple of exercises

00:00:28.268 --> 00:00:31.544
back, that the homozygous sickle cell allele condition only

00:00:31.544 --> 00:00:34.505
happens about 1 in 5000 people in North American,

00:00:34.505 --> 00:00:37.088
in the United States, whereas roughly 1 in 50

00:00:37.088 --> 00:00:39.923
in certain parts of sub-saharan Africa are affected

00:00:39.923 --> 00:00:43.580
by sickle cell anemia. This has everything to do

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.750
with the heterozygote having an advantage in malaria stricken

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.310
Africa. So, obviously understanding how and why certain alleles

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.730
exist and cause traits in a population,

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.540
is a detailed venture that requires a lot

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.860
of investigation. There's actually a great website

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.650
out there to help. Its called OMIM, or

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.490
Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man. OMIM is

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.370
a database that catalogues all the known diseases

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.750
with the genetic component. And when possible, links

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.470
them to the relevant genes in the human

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.910
genome, and provides references for further research and tools

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.340
for genomic analysis of a catalogued gene. You can

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.415
see here the entry for sickle cell anemia, which

00:01:26.415 --> 00:01:28.590
has a very large page that has a huge

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.565
description of the disease, tons of published research about

00:01:32.565 --> 00:01:35.575
it. And even gets a detailed description of the

00:01:35.575 --> 00:01:38.849
alleles the cause the various phenotypes. So we can

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:41.849
pick any disease that you know that has a genetic

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:48.280
component like Cystic Fibrosis. And you can search and find information about

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.510
the disease, as well as the genetic variations that are known to cause it. If

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.610
you're curious about other diseases, you should check them out in the OMIM

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.110
database. There'll be a link to it in the Instructor's notes of this page.
