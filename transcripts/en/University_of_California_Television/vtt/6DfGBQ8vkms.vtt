bipedal, naked, large-brained.

00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:35.924
Long the master of fire, tools,
and language, but still trying to

Aware that death is inevitable,

slowly. We hand down knowledge.

We empathize and deceive. We
shape the future from our shared

together experts from diverse disciplines

- [Christopher] I'm gonna start
with a family photo.

00:02:03.787 --> 00:02:07.386
This is my niece, Allison.
She's about seven years old.

00:02:07.386 --> 00:02:11.253
And this is also my niece, Allison,
right after birth.

00:02:11.253 --> 00:02:15.780
So what's going on here? There's something
very unusual about our species, right?

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.181
We take it for granted that our newborns
come out with a very large amount of

00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:24.256
body fat under the skin, or subcutaneous
fat. We even have a name for it; baby fat,

00:02:24.256 --> 00:02:27.855
and we consider it a mark of health.
But this is actually a very unusual

00:02:27.855 --> 00:02:31.524
characteristic. If you look across other
species, like gorilla for instance,

00:02:31.524 --> 00:02:35.448
they come out skinny.
Here's a baboon, also very skinny.

00:02:35.448 --> 00:02:39.790
Almost twenty years ago, I compiled all
the information I could about body fat

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.644
and newborns, and published a paper
on it. And this is what I found.

00:02:43.644 --> 00:02:47.185
These species here, as you can see,
are all about 3% body fat or less

00:02:47.185 --> 00:02:51.586
at birth. And this includes species
like elephant, seals, black bear,

00:02:51.586 --> 00:02:57.054
pigs, so typical mammals. Over here
you have harp seals, guinea pigs, and

00:02:57.054 --> 00:03:01.460
the very fattest species that I could find
evidence for was us, at about 15%

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.990
body fat. Now preparing for this talk, I
went into the literature and tried to find

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.650
any more data points that had been
published, especially on primates. Notice

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.010
here that the only primate that I could
find was a baboon, at about 3%. We

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.170
have some more data points now. We have
macaques, squirrel monkeys, another

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.470
species of macaques all have less than
3%. Over here on the left you will

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.160
see that there is a new species that I
found that is actually a little bit fatter

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.330
than us, it seems. But there are only 2
individuals in that sample and they are

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.100
clinical. They are a clinical sample, not
a wild sample. We will see how that shakes

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.600
out, but it really does not fundamentally
change the story. It is pretty clear that

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.180
this is an unusual characteristic for us.
We are born with a lot of body fat and not

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.600
only that... Look at body fat development
post-natally. What this shows is skinfold

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.260
thickness. This is how you measure the
thickness of the subcutaneous fat. You

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.420
take a skinfold and you literally
measure it with a caliper.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.480
This is the average here, this red line,
within the population. You see that we are

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.550
born with a lot of fat, but then right
after birth we put lots of calories into

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.320
putting on more fat. Our fat actually
peaks out during the first year of life.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.420
And then it declines until that very low
point that I showed you earlier, in mid

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.480
childhood. The question that I want to
pose today is, why are our newborns so

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.640
unusually fat and yet our children are so
lean? Before getting into this, I want to

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.530
dispel one myth that you will find out
there. If you look at old pediatrics

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.210
text books, there is this idea that yes,
this is an unusual characteristic for our

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.970
species. Perhaps it is insulation because
we lost hair. We lost our hair and we need

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.940
this insulatory layer of blubber to
compensate for that. There is a lot of

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.670
evidence against that. Sounds like a neat
idea, but we don't have any evidence that

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.610
humans preferentially deposit fat under
the skin. What happens is the more fat you

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.900
put on the more fat you get under the
skin. It is a good place to put it. There

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.070
is nothing that suggests that we have
anatomically adapted ourselves for that

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.150
kind of insulatory layer.
There are human populations that live in

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:00.650
the high Arctic, places like Alaska and so
forth, where you see biological

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.100
adaptations to conserve heat. You see
shorter limbs and you see shorter stature.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.750
What this does is it reduces skin surface
area and reduces heat loss. In this

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.360
populations you see no evidence for
thicker skin folds, in fact they tend to

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:20.700
have slightly thinner skinfolds than
the temperate populations. Finally, you

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.118
can look at newborns and see studies that
have done this to try to figure out what

00:05:24.118 --> 00:05:28.723
it is that predicts thermal stability.
It is not the skinfold thicknesses that

00:05:28.723 --> 00:05:32.995
matter. It seems to be the muscle mass,
which is where the heat's being generated.

00:05:32.995 --> 00:05:37.550
I didn't find a lot of evidence to support
this idea that this excessive amount of

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:42.121
subcutaneous fat, especially in our
newborns, is related to insulation.

00:05:42.121 --> 00:05:47.240
So I've proposed a different idea, a
competing idea. The key to understanding

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.860
our unusually fat babies may lie in an
other unique human trait, our unusually

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.970
large and energetically costly brains. The
idea here is that if you have a large and

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.660
energetically costly brain, you're gonna
need, effectively, a bigger battery to

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.640
back it up during a period of shortage.
That's the idea I want to dig into today.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.560
We're gonna explore, we're gonna talk a
bit about the human brain, it's energetic

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.170
costs, and why we need a bigger energy
backup. Then I'm gonna tell you about some

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.940
new work that some collaborators and I
published last year that quantifies the

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:21.400
cost of the brain across the life cycle,
from birth onward. Finally, we're gonna

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.740
bring all this together with some other
information and try to make sense of this

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.090
pattern of fat development that
we see in humans.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.080
Let's start with this first point. We're
a brainy species. The last four million

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.750
years, as you see here, you see a lot of
increase in brain size. As I've already

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.130
alluded to, this is important
energetically because brain is costly

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:44.600
tissue. A gram of adult brain uses about
fifteen times the energy of a gram of

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.830
muscle. All of you sitting here right now
are adults, your body is putting off heat

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.517
at about a hundred watts. That's the
amount of heat you're generating, warming

00:06:53.517 --> 00:06:58.310
up the room. Twenty of those watts or 20%
of your resting metabolic rate is

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.540
accounted for by the brain. That may not
seem that impressive. It may even seem a

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:07.450
little dim, but if you compare us to other
species, you'll see that that's actually

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:12.540
pretty remarkable. All these species up
here are in the order of 2 to 3% of

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:16.340
resting metabolic rate goes to the brain.
Here you see there's a couple primate

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:21.210
species, spider monkeys and chimpanzees,
at about 10%, and then human adults

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:26.410
are at 20%. If you look at a newborn
of course, the size of the head is

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:29.920
so much larger compared to the body, so
that number is gonna be a lot bigger in

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:35.125
the newborn. Sure enough, in the old
literature, the estimate had been that 60%

00:07:35.125 --> 00:07:39.940
of the resting metabolism is
necessary just to keep the brain going.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:44.330
This is important. It's not only just
costly, but it has other ramifications,

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.940
because unlike other tissues and organs
you can't turn the brain down. You can't

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:52.910
dim it. Let's say that you're starving or
under nutritional stress, the brain has a

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:56.400
constant metallic rate whether you're
sleeping, active, what have you. It has to

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:03.980
be maintained. Without access to that
energy you get brain damage. Naturally, it

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:07.320
makes sense that we need to have a bigger
energy backup. You can think of an

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.650
analogy from day to day life that
I think illustrates this. That would be

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:14.280
a mortgage. Every month, if you have a
house and you have a house mortgage, you

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:19.160
have to pay that mortgage. If you don't
you have to foreclose. If you lose your

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.220
job, you'd better have money in your
savings account in order to cover that

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.980
mortgage for the period you are
unemployed. The bigger your mortgage, the

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.890
bigger the savings account you're gonna
need to have to avoid a foreclosure. It's

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:36.780
the same sort of logic. Effectively, our
newborns have a mortgage that accounts for

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:42.000
60% of their budget, so they need
to have a very big savings account. Maybe

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.150
this gives us some insights into what's
going on at birth, but we also have to

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:49.810
understand why we become so lean by
childhood. We set up both of this

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:54.040
problems. Maybe it's the change in the
size of that mortgage that matters. Let's

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:58.490
go ahead and start to look at that. What
this shows here is the percentage of body

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:04.190
weight that's accounted for by the brain
at different ages in humans. At birth, as

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:09.850
you can see, it's about 12% of body
weight. Then it declines as that ratio of

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:16.950
brain size to body size also declines.
Perhaps we need this big energy buffer

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:20.650
back here because our brains really
dominate the budget, but down here less

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:25.420
so. Maybe that's what's going on.
Unfortunately, it's not that simple

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:28.270
because all we're looking at in that last
graph is the size of the brain. There are

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:32.600
other factors to take into account. Energy
used by a gram of brain is actually very

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.260
dynamic very development and this relates
to the high cost of learning during

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:41.190
childhood. What makes the brain costly is
synapses, that is, the connections between

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:45.960
nerves. The number of synapses changes
very dramatically. Let's take a look at

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:50.970
that. These are classic data on synaptic
densities. This is telling us how many

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:54.480
synapses there are, how many neural
connections there are within a gram of

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:59.080
brain. You can see that it goes way up
quickly after birth, peaks out during

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:03.560
childhood, and then it declines again.
There's a process of pruning. This entire

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:08.781
period of very high synaptic connectivity
is all about learning during childhood.

00:10:08.781 --> 00:10:11.847
What it means from our perspective is
that there's a need for energy to buoy

00:10:11.847 --> 00:10:17.650
that excess neuronal activity. So how does
one go about measuring that energy? Well,

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:22.150
positron emission tomography imaging, PET
imaging, is one way you could do this.

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:27.182
This is what allows you to measure the
rate of glucose uptake in the brain.

00:10:27.182 --> 00:10:32.058
Harry Chugani, in a classic paper from
1987 that I'm showing here, did this in

00:10:32.058 --> 00:10:35.514
kids from birth all the way up to
adulthood. You can see these folks over

00:10:35.514 --> 00:10:40.240
here on the right, are the adults. So this
dotted line is the adult level of glucose

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:47.280
uptake. At birth, each gram of brain
tissue is using about 30% less glucose

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:51.620
than the adult brain. That's because the
synapses haven't proliferated yet. Then by

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:56.420
childhood, it's actually twice the adult
rate, so it's much higher. Then you get

00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:01.760
the pruning and it prunes down to the
adult level eventually. What we need to

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.340
really take into account what's going on
with the brain, is not just to account for

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:09.870
the size of the brain. But we also need to
take into account this changing energy

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:15.580
density, this changing energy use rate
related to learning. This is actually

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:20.330
something that I and my collaborators in
Northwestern University, at Wayne State,

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:25.040
and at George Washington University set
out to do. We published a paper on this

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.290
last year. I'm going to tell you what we
did, very quickly. We started with

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:32.560
Chugani's pet data, which I've already
shown you. That tells us how much glucose

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.890
each gram of brain is using. To get the
global cost of the brain, we need to know

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:42.940
how many grams of brain there are. For
that, we used brain volume data from MRI.

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:47.010
You do the numbers and you get total brain
energy cost. There are many more steps

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:49.000
involved, but that's a simplified version.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.960
When you do that, this is what we find.
This shows brain glucose uptake from birth

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.925
until 15 years of age. Fifteen years is
the last PET measurements, that's where

00:11:58.925 --> 00:12:03.120
we stopped. You can see that it peaks out
at about 5 years of age.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.384
It's higher in males
because they're just bigger.

00:12:05.384 --> 00:12:07.648
There's no real biological
difference there. There's a remarkable

00:12:07.648 --> 00:12:13.730
story here. Brain glucose uptake at
5 years of age is about twice the adult

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:18.200
level. You can see this dotted line here.
Their brains are using twice the energy of

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:22.880
the adult brain, despite the fact that
their brains haven't fully reached adult

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:28.000
size yet, and despite the fact that their
bodies are one-third the size. This is a

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.910
remarkable burden on their bodies,
energetically. That's what we want to take

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:36.250
into account. Let's look at the next step
here. Instead of looking at grams of

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:41.185
glucose, let's consider brain energetics
as a fraction of the resting metabolic

00:12:41.185 --> 00:12:45.249
rate, like we did earlier. When we do it
that way, we see that it's peaking out

00:12:45.249 --> 00:12:52.180
at about 4 to 5 years of age again. And at
that point, two-thirds of all resting

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:56.116
calories are going to the brain,
which is pretty remarkable.

00:12:56.116 --> 00:13:00.051
This leaves only one-third of the calories
to do everything else.

00:13:00.051 --> 00:13:03.453
So clearly, some other functions
must have been short-changed in us.

00:13:03.453 --> 00:13:07.052
One of those functions that did get
short-changed, it looks like, was body

00:13:07.052 --> 00:13:12.330
weight growth. What this shows here is the
rate of body weight gain. As we all know,

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:16.940
infants grow very quickly, and then the
rate of weight gain slows down. They start

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:21.160
to grow quite slowly by age 5 or so,
or during childhood. You almost don't see

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.250
them growing. You notice their development
but you don't see them getting bigger and

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:30.530
bigger. Then, gradually, weight gain takes
off again with puberty. Let's superimpose

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:33.782
the brain energetics curve on that.
There's pretty clearly a nice relationship

00:13:33.782 --> 00:13:38.183
between these two. As the brain becomes
increasingly costly, because of

00:13:38.183 --> 00:13:44.058
brain growth and the proliferation of
those costly synapses, body weight growth

00:13:44.058 --> 00:13:48.516
is going down. When the brain is at its
most costly, body weight growth is at

00:13:48.516 --> 00:13:51.256
its lowest. And then it reverses
with puberty.

00:13:51.848 --> 00:13:54.518
So clearly, there is something very
interesting going on here. It looks like

00:13:54.518 --> 00:13:59.640
one of the ways that we were able to
support these very high energetic costs

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.114
related to brain development is by
taking calories that would have

00:14:02.114 --> 00:14:04.657
gone into growth and
putting them into the brain.

00:14:04.657 --> 00:14:07.919
So we're kind of subsidizing that.
One of the things that suffers from that

00:14:07.919 --> 00:14:13.782
is fat stores. That's why we have such low
adiposity during this era, because

00:14:13.782 --> 00:14:17.985
we're basically shutting down growth
and we're shutting down fat deposition.

00:14:17.985 --> 00:14:22.920
This leads to a bit of a paradox in what
would appear to be a challenge for a

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:27.320
hypothesis. We've got the age of lowest
energy reserves, when our savings account

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:32.610
is at its lowest, coinciding with the age
when our mortgage is at its highest. This

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:37.510
looks very precarious. Doesn't this
potentially pose a problem for a

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:41.110
hypothesis? If baby fat is a brain
battery, how can body fat reach its lowest

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:46.430
level at the age when the brain's energy
needs are greatest. The answer is, you

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:50.210
don't necessarily need a large savings
account if you've got wealthy relatives

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:55.090
and friends who are willing to lend to
you. That's what goes on. Let's take a

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:59.100
look at this. As children grow and develop
they shift from relying on their onboard

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:04.500
energy buffer, their body fat, to social
buffering. The effectiveness of social

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:08.660
buffering increases and as that happens,
the reliance on body fat goes down. We're

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:12.150
gonna take a look at this. Let's start
early on, when there's this high reliance

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:15.782
on body fat as we've already talked about.
Why do we rely on body fat early?

00:15:15.782 --> 00:15:19.984
The reason is this; because of the
cause of nutritional stress.

00:15:19.984 --> 00:15:24.100
Early in life, the main causes of
nutritional stress are infectious disease.

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:28.230
Forget about the common cold. Think about
environments that are less sanitized than

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:32.970
ours. Infections can be quite severe.
This is really the cause of, for instance,

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:36.750
under-5 mortality, infant mortality.
It's all about under nutrition and most of

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:41.110
it is driven by infection. It's easy to
see why. Kids when they get sick, they get

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:48.160
anorexia. They stop eating. Diarrheal
diseases are very common in infancy. This

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:52.040
impairs digestion. Your parents and your
caregivers can have all the calories and

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:55.750
the food in the world, but if you stop
eating and you don't digest, you're not

00:15:55.750 --> 00:16:00.120
gonna get access to them. Which forces you
to go internal and rely on your on onboard

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:04.260
energy reserves. That's really the only
strategy that you have. Add on top of

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.700
this, fever that actually increases your
energy expenditure and sort of makes the

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:13.370
whole thing worse. That's the point. The
common symptoms related to infections, cut

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:19.270
the baby off from caregivers and force a
reliance internally on their own battery.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:23.990
Here we see the age trends in diarrheal
illness, globally. And you see that it

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:27.800
really peaks out in late infancy and the
second half of the first year. This

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.750
coincides with weaning and the
introductions of foods that are often not

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:36.310
sterile. Newborns are born without
antibodies which is why they get sick so

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:39.790
much. Every time they get sick, they
acquire antibodies and they become more

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:44.490
and more protected moving forward. As
infants age, they acquire these protective

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:49.000
antibodies, and the infections then
plummet. They're really not a problem by

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.920
four to five years of age, or not as much.
As those infections go down, they're no

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:57.980
longer being cut off from their caregivers
and they can start to benefit from the

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:01.580
unique features of the way we raise
our kids. I'm gonna talk about that.

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:03.519
It'll be the last point we talk about.

00:17:03.519 --> 00:17:09.080
If we look at other mammals, food comes
from the mother, breast milk. Eventually

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:13.160
you get weaned and you self-provision.
In our species, fathers are a part of the

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.700
picture, both in terms of provisioning and
care, but there's a whole cast of other

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:20.170
characters. This is something fairly
unique to us. We're considered cooperative

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:24.860
breeding species because many individuals
are involved in raising our kids.

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:29.319
Importantly, those human caregivers, in
turn, are embedded with the networks based

00:17:29.319 --> 00:17:33.650
on cooperation and food sharing. Let's
take a look at this. Here's an example

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:37.922
where there are four hunters that are not
sharing. The second individual down has a

00:17:37.922 --> 00:17:41.452
kill and the others don't, so they go
hungry. On this day, the first individual

00:17:41.452 --> 00:17:44.389
has a kill, but the others go hungry,
and so on.

00:17:44.389 --> 00:17:46.734
It's kind of a feast/famine scenario.

00:17:46.734 --> 00:17:50.914
Here's the same scenario where this
individual shares with other folks

00:17:50.914 --> 00:17:57.381
under the assumption that they're gonna
share with him when they have a kill.

00:17:57.381 --> 00:18:00.655
In this kind of system, with food sharing,
everybody gets to eat every day.

00:18:00.655 --> 00:18:03.058
You don't have the feast/famine.
This is what we do.

00:18:03.058 --> 00:18:07.388
If you look at data from hunter/gatherer
societies like the Hiwi and the Ache

00:18:07.388 --> 00:18:11.789
from lowland Amazon in South America,
this shows the number of families

00:18:11.789 --> 00:18:14.454
that receive part of the kill.
This is very common.

00:18:14.454 --> 00:18:19.981
Food flows between families. Here's an
other interesting study that was done

00:18:19.981 --> 00:18:24.789
among the Hadza. Here, the individuals
were given honey sticks. There was an

00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:28.630
economic game and the researchers
evaluated how honey flowed through the

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:34.510
society. As you can see, it's flowing all
over the place to both genetic kin, to

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:39.480
in-laws and to friends. If somebody up
here comes up short one day, there's gonna

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:43.940
be food coming from elsewhere. Our
caregivers, there are not only multiple

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:47.120
caregivers taking care of our kids, but
they're embedded in these networks of

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.181
cooperation of food sharing which buffer.

00:18:49.181 --> 00:18:52.740
It's for this reason, I think, that we
can go out on a limb as children.

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:56.370
Our children go way out on a limb, because
they're maxing out the size of their

00:18:56.370 --> 00:19:00.610
mortgage at a point when the have a
minimal savings account. They can do it

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:05.820
because they're embedded within those
networks. To summarize and come back to

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:11.990
where I began, our babies are born with a
lot of fat. The reasons for this are that

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:15.780
they have extremely high energy
requirements for their brains that are

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:21.220
fragile, combined with the fact that the
primary cause of nutritional stress at

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:24.789
this age is infection, which cuts them
off from caregivers and forces a reliance

00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:28.783
on internal stores. The situation's very
different by childhood. The brain is even

00:19:28.783 --> 00:19:33.000
more costly, but now they're embedded
within, and benefit from that social

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.457
buffering that's so effective.
They no longer need to put those calories

00:19:37.457 --> 00:19:40.522
away in a savings account. They can use
them for things that matter at this age;

00:19:40.522 --> 00:19:42.786
learning and child development.

00:19:42.786 --> 00:19:44.724
That's all. Thanks.
