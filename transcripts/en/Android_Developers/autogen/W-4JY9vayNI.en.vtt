and their goals they tell me that

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850

how your users behave and so for me it

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950
how your users behave and so for me it
 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.010
how your users behave and so for me it
really makes sense that if you want to

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020
really makes sense that if you want to
 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.500
really makes sense that if you want to
better optimize for user behavior we

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510
better optimize for user behavior we
 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.170
better optimize for user behavior we
should understand a bit more about

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180
should understand a bit more about
 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.740

after that initial onboarding phase so

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250
after that initial onboarding phase so
 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.710
after that initial onboarding phase so
hopefully everyone here has that

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720
hopefully everyone here has that
 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.960
hopefully everyone here has that
behavior in mind so keep it in mind

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970
behavior in mind so keep it in mind
 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.399
behavior in mind so keep it in mind
throughout the rest of the of the

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409
throughout the rest of the of the
 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:35.030
throughout the rest of the of the
session so now what I want to do is

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040
session so now what I want to do is
 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.059
session so now what I want to do is
introduce you to three steps inspired by

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069
introduce you to three steps inspired by
 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.979
introduce you to three steps inspired by
behavioral insights that you can follow

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989
behavioral insights that you can follow
 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.740
behavioral insights that you can follow
to make this particular desired action a

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750
to make this particular desired action a
 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.099
to make this particular desired action a
reality many companies tend to focus on

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109
reality many companies tend to focus on
 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:48.349
reality many companies tend to focus on
step 3 which is all about trying to

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359
step 3 which is all about trying to
 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.110
step 3 which is all about trying to
boost user motivation when actually I

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120
boost user motivation when actually I
 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.640
boost user motivation when actually I
think time and money could be better

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650
think time and money could be better
 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.099
think time and money could be better
spent by focusing on step 1 which is

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109
spent by focusing on step 1 which is
 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:56.750
spent by focusing on step 1 which is
identifying the barriers in the first

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760
identifying the barriers in the first
 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.360
identifying the barriers in the first
place and so when I talked about step 3

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370
place and so when I talked about step 3
 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.729
place and so when I talked about step 3
then it's about often developers focus

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739
then it's about often developers focus
 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.160
then it's about often developers focus
on costly reward schemes and loyalty

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170
on costly reward schemes and loyalty
 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.470
on costly reward schemes and loyalty
schemes so instead let's start with step

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480
schemes so instead let's start with step
 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.009
schemes so instead let's start with step

simplifying the behavior so every

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099
simplifying the behavior so every
 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.099
simplifying the behavior so every
decision we make requires overcoming

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109
decision we make requires overcoming

decision we make requires overcoming
barriers of some kind they think about

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389
barriers of some kind they think about
 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.330
barriers of some kind they think about
everyone in this room today the fact

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340
everyone in this room today the fact
 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.180
everyone in this room today the fact
that you've decided to attend IO perhaps

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190
that you've decided to attend IO perhaps
 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.640
that you've decided to attend IO perhaps
you have to overcome huge distances to

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650
you have to overcome huge distances to
 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.680
you have to overcome huge distances to
get here you have to debate over whether

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690
get here you have to debate over whether
 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.360
get here you have to debate over whether
the cost of the ticket was worth the

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370
the cost of the ticket was worth the
 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.970
the cost of the ticket was worth the
price maybe you had loads of it a

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980
price maybe you had loads of it a
 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.680
price maybe you had loads of it a
commitment that you have to also think

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690
commitment that you have to also think
 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.289
commitment that you have to also think
about committing to but instead you're

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299
about committing to but instead you're
 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.470
about committing to but instead you're
here today so why haven't more users

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480
here today so why haven't more users
 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.720
here today so why haven't more users
carried out that one specific behavior

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730
carried out that one specific behavior
 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.720
carried out that one specific behavior
that you've identified a few moments ago

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730
that you've identified a few moments ago
 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.789
that you've identified a few moments ago
again let's think about it could be it

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799
again let's think about it could be it
 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.740
again let's think about it could be it
takes too much time for them to complete

these four different techniques really
help to simplify that decision for the

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:39.580
help to simplify that decision for the
 

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.909
help to simplify that decision for the
user and make sure that it's more likely

00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:41.919
user and make sure that it's more likely
 

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:43.440
user and make sure that it's more likely
that they're going to choose the yearly

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:43.450
that they're going to choose the yearly
 

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.390
that they're going to choose the yearly
plan and that's actually what the simple

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:45.400
plan and that's actually what the simple
 

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.290

fee SAP saw so we've covered some

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:49.300
fee SAP saw so we've covered some
 

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.719
fee SAP saw so we've covered some
tactics to simplify the behavior you've

00:07:51.719 --> 00:07:51.729
tactics to simplify the behavior you've
 

00:07:51.729 --> 00:07:54.480
tactics to simplify the behavior you've
identified the barriers and so what

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:54.490
identified the barriers and so what
 

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:56.310
identified the barriers and so what
we're going to do now is to move on to

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:56.320
we're going to do now is to move on to
 

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.750
we're going to do now is to move on to
step two or three which is all about

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:57.760
step two or three which is all about
 

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.990
step two or three which is all about

that particular action and often you

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:08.680
that particular action and often you

I would suggest from this slide is

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:14.920
I would suggest from this slide is
 

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.520
I would suggest from this slide is
rewarding your users with more

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:17.530
rewarding your users with more
 

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:19.920
rewarding your users with more
meaningful rewards so if we look at

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:19.930
meaningful rewards so if we look at
 

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:22.170
meaningful rewards so if we look at
status how can you make your most

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:22.180

the different perks that they can get
that other users might not and then if

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:29.380
that other users might not and then if
 

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.410
that other users might not and then if
we think about access what are the

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:31.420
we think about access what are the
 

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.450
we think about access what are the
features within your app that maybe are

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:33.460
features within your app that maybe are
 

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:35.940
features within your app that maybe are
exclusively accessible to certain users

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:35.950
exclusively accessible to certain users
 

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:38.100
exclusively accessible to certain users
and that could be a more powerful way of

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:38.110
and that could be a more powerful way of
 

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:40.050
and that could be a more powerful way of
engaging them and actually keeping them

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:40.060

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:44.190
engaging them and actually keeping them
retained for longer so I'm sure many of

irrational so I'd like to frame this

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:28.360
irrational so I'd like to frame this
 

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.450
irrational so I'd like to frame this
presentation around this framework that

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:30.460
presentation around this framework that
 

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:32.250
presentation around this framework that
we have developed as a lab that could

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:32.260
we have developed as a lab that could

help you make better decision in your

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:34.180
help you make better decision in your
 

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:36.390
help you make better decision in your
app so first of all think about the

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:36.400
app so first of all think about the
 

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.760
app so first of all think about the
behavior what's the exact behavior that

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:38.770
behavior what's the exact behavior that
 

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:41.700
behavior what's the exact behavior that
you want your user to achieve then think

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:41.710
you want your user to achieve then think
 

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:44.280
you want your user to achieve then think
about the barriers what are the elements

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:44.290
about the barriers what are the elements
 

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:46.290
about the barriers what are the elements
that could prevent your user from

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:46.300
that could prevent your user from
 

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:48.720
that could prevent your user from
achieving this behavior and finally

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:48.730
achieving this behavior and finally
 

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:50.910
achieving this behavior and finally
think about the benefits what do I gain

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:50.920
think about the benefits what do I gain
 

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:54.630
think about the benefits what do I gain
once I achieve that behavior so let's

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:54.640
once I achieve that behavior so let's
 

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.150
once I achieve that behavior so let's
quickly jump into one example this is

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:57.160
quickly jump into one example this is
 

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.800
quickly jump into one example this is
the first screen that you use it to get

00:21:58.800 --> 00:21:58.810
the first screen that you use it to get
 

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:01.200
the first screen that you use it to get
when you open fabulous and as you can

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:01.210
when you open fabulous and as you can
 

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:02.760
when you open fabulous and as you can
see looks pretty good

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:02.770
see looks pretty good
 

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:04.950

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960
let's get Sabbath what's your most
 

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.690
let's get Sabbath what's your most
important health goal right now then you

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:06.700
important health goal right now then you
 

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.220
important health goal right now then you
can choose to feel more energized to

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:08.230
can choose to feel more energized to
 

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:09.280
can choose to feel more energized to
sleep better

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:09.290
sleep better
 

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:11.950

look spit you out but there is one big

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:11.960
look spit you out but there is one big
 

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:15.160
look spit you out but there is one big
problem with this screen only you just a

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:15.170
problem with this screen only you just a
 

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:19.990
problem with this screen only you just a
few seconds to think it out so the

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.000
few seconds to think it out so the
 

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.970
few seconds to think it out so the
problem was the screen was the question

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:21.980
problem was the screen was the question
 

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.610
problem was the screen was the question
that we were asking what's your most

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:24.620
that we were asking what's your most
 

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:26.230
that we were asking what's your most
important health go right now

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:26.240
important health go right now
 

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.720
important health go right now
so when user reduce they started asking

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:28.730
so when user reduce they started asking
 

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:31.240
so when user reduce they started asking
themselves all sorts of questions can I

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:31.250
themselves all sorts of questions can I
 

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:33.700
themselves all sorts of questions can I
make the wrong choice can I change my

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:33.710
make the wrong choice can I change my
 

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:35.830
make the wrong choice can I change my
opinion later what if I want to change

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:35.840
opinion later what if I want to change
 

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.740
opinion later what if I want to change
my goal so one simple change that we did

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:38.750
my goal so one simple change that we did
 

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:42.010
my goal so one simple change that we did
is just asking them which goal would you

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:42.020
is just asking them which goal would you
 

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:44.500
is just asking them which goal would you
like to start with and now we are giving

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:44.510
like to start with and now we are giving
 

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:46.180
like to start with and now we are giving
them the permission to change their

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:46.190
them the permission to change their
 

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:49.840
them the permission to change their
minds later and this has uplifted the

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:49.850
minds later and this has uplifted the
 

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:51.790
minds later and this has uplifted the
unburden completion rate by 15 percent

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:51.800
unburden completion rate by 15 percent
 

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.920
unburden completion rate by 15 percent
so we wanted to go even further than

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:53.930
so we wanted to go even further than
 

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:56.080
so we wanted to go even further than
this and we started limiting the options

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:56.090
this and we started limiting the options
 

00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:57.700
this and we started limiting the options
as well like providing them with the

00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:57.710
as well like providing them with the
 

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:00.400
as well like providing them with the
default option and this again has

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:00.410
default option and this again has
 

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:03.550
default option and this again has
increased their attention on day one so

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:03.560
increased their attention on day one so
 

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:06.850
increased their attention on day one so

solve this let's go back to these ideas

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:18.230
solve this let's go back to these ideas
 

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:20.920
solve this let's go back to these ideas
of behavior economics let's first start

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:20.930
of behavior economics let's first start
 

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:22.900
of behavior economics let's first start
with the behavior what's the behavior

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:22.910
with the behavior what's the behavior
 

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:24.880
with the behavior what's the behavior
that you're trying to achieve feeling

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:24.890
that you're trying to achieve feeling
 

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:28.210
that you're trying to achieve feeling
more energized well that's not the

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:28.220
more energized well that's not the
 

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:30.310
more energized well that's not the
behavior actually that's the outcome if

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.320
behavior actually that's the outcome if
 

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.080
behavior actually that's the outcome if
you want to think about the behavior

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:32.090
you want to think about the behavior
 

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:35.140
you want to think about the behavior
think about the exact set that your

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:35.150
think about the exact set that your
 

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:37.870
think about the exact set that your
users need to take in our case it's

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:37.880
users need to take in our case it's
 

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.150
users need to take in our case it's
waking up in the morning reaching out to

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:40.160
waking up in the morning reaching out to
 

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.130
waking up in the morning reaching out to
my bottle of water and then drinking

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:42.140
my bottle of water and then drinking
 

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:44.200
my bottle of water and then drinking
water and taking some time to feel great

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:44.210
water and taking some time to feel great
 

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:48.850
water and taking some time to feel great
the behavior is not the outcome and then

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:48.860
the behavior is not the outcome and then
 

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:50.920
the behavior is not the outcome and then
let's get to the second step the

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:50.930
let's get to the second step the
 

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:53.169
let's get to the second step the
barriers I want to drink water or I

00:24:53.169 --> 00:24:53.179
barriers I want to drink water or I
 

00:24:53.179 --> 00:24:56.230
barriers I want to drink water or I
don't want what are the barriers so we

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:56.240
don't want what are the barriers so we
 

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.510
don't want what are the barriers so we
conducted the user survey and these were

00:24:58.510 --> 00:24:58.520
conducted the user survey and these were
 

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:01.299
conducted the user survey and these were
the three main obstacles I'm not

00:25:01.299 --> 00:25:01.309
the three main obstacles I'm not
 

00:25:01.309 --> 00:25:03.600
the three main obstacles I'm not
convinced that I need to drink water I

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:03.610
convinced that I need to drink water I
 

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:06.070
convinced that I need to drink water I
want to drink water but I don't have

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080
want to drink water but I don't have
 

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.740
want to drink water but I don't have
water at reach or I'm just not very

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:08.750
water at reach or I'm just not very
 

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:13.630
water at reach or I'm just not very
committed let's try to solve this this

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:13.640
committed let's try to solve this this
 

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.310
committed let's try to solve this this
is the new embodying if the new

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:15.320
is the new embodying if the new
 

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.380
is the new embodying if the new
embodying instead of asking you to drink

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:17.390
embodying instead of asking you to drink
 

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:19.090
embodying instead of asking you to drink
water we start by asking you a few

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:19.100
water we start by asking you a few
 

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:20.919
water we start by asking you a few
questions do you want to build the habit

00:25:20.919 --> 00:25:20.929
questions do you want to build the habit
 

00:25:20.929 --> 00:25:22.960
questions do you want to build the habit
of exercising in the morning some people

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:22.970
of exercising in the morning some people
 

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:24.669
of exercising in the morning some people
might say yes some people might say no

00:25:24.669 --> 00:25:24.679
might say yes some people might say no
 

00:25:24.679 --> 00:25:26.830
might say yes some people might say no
then do you want to build the habit of

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:26.840
then do you want to build the habit of
 

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.600
then do you want to build the habit of
eating great breakfast in the morning

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:28.610
eating great breakfast in the morning
 

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:30.100
eating great breakfast in the morning
saying some people might say yes some

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:30.110
saying some people might say yes some
 

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:31.990
saying some people might say yes some
people might say no and then we ask you

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:32.000
people might say no and then we ask you
 

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.910
people might say no and then we ask you
the most important question for us do

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:33.920
the most important question for us do
 

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.049
the most important question for us do
you want to drink water in the morning

00:25:35.049 --> 00:25:35.059
you want to drink water in the morning
 

00:25:35.059 --> 00:25:37.870
you want to drink water in the morning
so this seems very easy related to the

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:37.880
so this seems very easy related to the
 

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.090
so this seems very easy related to the
tea all the goals just drinking water so

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:40.100
tea all the goals just drinking water so
 

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.590
tea all the goals just drinking water so
even if I said no to the two other

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:41.600
even if I said no to the two other
 

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.810
even if I said no to the two other
questions I'm going to say yes almost

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:43.820
questions I'm going to say yes almost
 

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:46.120
questions I'm going to say yes almost
99% of the people are going to say yes I

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:46.130
99% of the people are going to say yes I
 

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:47.710

want to drink water in the morning and
 

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.380
want to drink water in the morning and
in this case it was your choice actually

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:50.390
in this case it was your choice actually
 

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:52.360
in this case it was your choice actually
it was something that you choose to do

it was something that you choose to do
it's not as forcing this on you now

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:56.300
it's not as forcing this on you now
 

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:59.590
it's not as forcing this on you now
let's think about the second barrier I'm

00:25:59.590 --> 00:25:59.600
let's think about the second barrier I'm
 

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.780
let's think about the second barrier I'm
not very committed I don't feel very

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:01.790
not very committed I don't feel very
 

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:04.030
not very committed I don't feel very
committed to this well what you can do

00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:04.040
committed to this well what you can do
 

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.160
committed to this well what you can do
in this case is using what we call in

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:06.170
in this case is using what we call in
