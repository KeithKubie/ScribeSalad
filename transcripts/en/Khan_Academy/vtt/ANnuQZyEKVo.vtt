00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.550
Two of the points that define
a certain quadrilateral

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.780
are negative 4 comma negative 2.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:08.720
So let's plot that.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.080
So that's negative
4 comma negative 2.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.760
And 0 comma 5.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.580
So that's 0 comma
5 right over there.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.990
The quadrilateral
is left unchanged

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.180
by a reflection over the
line y is equal to x over 2.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.460
So what does that
line look like?

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.270
y is equal to x over 2.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.760
I'll do that in the blue.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.850
y is equal to x over 2.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.530
So when x is equal to 0, y is 0.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.330
The y-intercept is 0 here.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.520
And the slope is 1/2.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.660
Every time x increases by
1, y will increase by 1/2.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.020
Or when x increases by
2, y will increase by 1.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.700
So x increases by
2, y increases by 1.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.500
X increases by 2,
y increases by 1.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.890
Or another way to think about
it, y is always 1/2 of x.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.720
So when x is 4, y is 2.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.120
When x is 6, y is 3.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.940
When x is 8, y is 4.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.090
So we can connect these.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.490
Let me try my best
attempt to draw

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.670
these in a relatively
straight line.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.230
And then I can keep going.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.870
When x is negative
2, y is negative 1.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.280
When x is negative
4, y is negative 2.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.920
So it actually goes through
that point right there.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.525
And it just keeps going
with a slope of 1/2.

00:01:26.525 --> 00:01:28.900
So this line, and I can draw
it a little bit thicker now,

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.670
now that I've dotted it out.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:37.426
This is the line y
is equal to x over 2.

00:01:37.426 --> 00:01:39.760
And they also say that
the quadrilateral is left

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.440
unchanged by reflection
over the line

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.180
y is equal to
negative 2x plus 5.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.710
So the y-intercept here is 5.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.405
When x is 0, y is 5.

00:01:49.405 --> 00:01:51.030
So it actually goes
through that point.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.720
And the slope is negative 2.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.310
Every time we increase by 1-- or
every time we increase x by 1,

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.330
we decrease y by 2.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.380
So that would go there.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.620
We go there.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.930
And we keep going at
a slope of negative 2.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.680
So it's going to look
something like this.

00:02:09.992 --> 00:02:11.450
It actually goes
through that point

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.040
and just keeps going on and on.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.250
So this is my best attempt
at drawing that line.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.639
So that is y is equal
to negative 2x plus 5.

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:24.680
Now let's think about it.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.370
Let's see if we can
draw this quadrilateral.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.240
So let's first reflect
the quadrilateral,

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.056
or let's reflect the points
we have over the line y

00:02:33.056 --> 00:02:33.930
is equal to x over 2.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.100
So this is the line y
is equal to x over 2.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.310
This magenta point,
the point negative 4, 2

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.750
is already on that line.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.170
So it's its own reflection,
I guess you could say.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.580
It's on the mirror is one
way to think about it.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.310
But we can easily reflect
at this line over here.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:56.790
This line, if we were to drop
a perpendicular-- And actually,

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.520
this line right over here,
y is equal to negative 2x

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.395
plus 5 is perpendicular
to y is equal to x over 2.

00:03:02.395 --> 00:03:03.760
How do we know?

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.694
Well if one line
has a slope of m,

00:03:07.694 --> 00:03:09.110
then the line
that's perpendicular

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.818
would be the negative
reciprocal of this.

00:03:10.818 --> 00:03:13.040
It would be negative 1 over m.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.390
So this first line
has a slope of 1/2.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.710
Well what's the negative
reciprocal of 1/2?

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.230
Well the reciprocal
of 1/2 is 2/1.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.450
and you make that negative.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.250
So it is equal to negative 2.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.730
So this slope is a negative
reciprocal of this slope.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.220
So these lines are
indeed-- I'm trying

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.410
to erase that-- perpendicular.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.540
So we literally could
drop a perpendicular,

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.910
literally go along this
line right over here,

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.660
in our attempt to reflect.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.260
And we see that we're
going down 2, over 1 twice.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.224
So let's go down 2, over 1,
down 2, over 1, twice again.

00:03:51.224 --> 00:03:52.640
Let me do that in
that same color.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.326
The reflection of this point,
across y is equal to x/2

00:03:57.326 --> 00:03:59.589
is this point right over there.

00:03:59.589 --> 00:04:01.630
So now we have three points
of our quadrilateral.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.270
Let's see if we
can get a fourth.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:04.999
So let's go to
the magenta point.

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:06.540
The magenta point
we've already seen.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.910
It's sitting on top
of y equals x/2,

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.040
so trying to reflect it
doesn't help us much,

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.700
but we could try to
reflect it across y

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.663
is equal to negative 2x plus 5.

00:04:15.663 --> 00:04:18.079
So once again these lines are
perpendicular to each other.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.750
Actually let me mark that off.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.029
These lines are perpendicular.

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:24.100
So we can drop a perpendicular
and try to find its reflection.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.320
So we're going to
the right 2 and up 1.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.790
We're doing that once, twice,
three times on the left side.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.020
So let's do that once, twice,
three times on the right side.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.150
So the reflection
is right there.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.000
We essentially want
to go to that line.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.400
And however far we
were to the left of it,

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.970
we want to go that same, that
bottom left direction, which

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.440
you want to go in the same
direction, to the top right,

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.770
the same distance to
get the reflection.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:48.690
So there you have it.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.770
There is our other point.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.720
So now we have the four
points of this quadrilateral.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.486
Four points of this
quadrilateral are-- or the four

00:05:02.486 --> 00:05:04.610
sides, let me actually just
draw the quadrilateral.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.060
We have our four points.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.290
So this is one side
right over here.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.060
This is one side,
right over here.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.050
This is another side,
right over here.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.130
And you can verify that
these are parallel.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.921
How would you verify
that they're parallel?

00:05:19.921 --> 00:05:21.240
Well they have the same slope.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.130
To get from this point to that
point, you have to go over,

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.240
so your run has to
be 4, and you have

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.570
to rise 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.363
So the slope here is 7/4.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.275
Rise over run, or change in
y over change in x, is 7/4.

00:05:39.275 --> 00:05:42.960
And over here,
you go 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.940
So you run 4 and then you
rise 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.020
So the slope here is also 7/4.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:58.220
So these two lines are
going to be parallel.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.270
And then we could draw
these lines over here.

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.850
So this one at the top.

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.990
The one at the top
right over there.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.960
And what's its slope?

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:08.626
Well, let's see.

00:06:08.626 --> 00:06:10.790
We go from x equals
0 to x equals 8.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.790
So we go down, our change in
y is negative 1 every time

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.040
we increase x by 8.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.779
So this is the slope of--
slope is equal to negative 1/8.

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:24.320
And that's the exact same slope
that we have right over here.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.880
Negative 1/8.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.130
So these two lines
are parallel as well.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.842
This line is parallel
to this line as well.

00:06:31.842 --> 00:06:33.925
So at minimum, we're dealing
with a parallelogram.

00:06:33.925 --> 00:06:35.940
But let's see if we can
get even more specific.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.120
Because this kind of
looks like a rhombus.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.840
It looks like a
parallelogram, where

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.211
all four sides have
the same length.

00:06:43.211 --> 00:06:44.710
So there's a couple
of ways that you

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.034
could verify that this
parallelogram is a rhombus.

00:06:47.034 --> 00:06:48.450
One way is you
could actually find

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.205
the distance between the points.

00:06:50.205 --> 00:06:52.830
We know the coordinates, so you
could use the distance formula,

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.090
which really comes straight
out of the Pythagorean theorem.

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.070
Or even better, you could
look at the diagonals

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.114
of this rhombus-- we could
look at the diagonals

00:06:59.114 --> 00:07:00.030
of this parallelogram.

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:02.110
We are trying to figure
out if it's a rhombus.

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.840
And if the diagonals
are perpendicular,

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:04.860
then you're dealing
with a rhombus.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.735
And we've already shown
that these diagonals,

00:07:06.735 --> 00:07:10.500
that this diagonal, this
diagonal, and this diagonal

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.140
are perpendicular.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.330
They intersect at right angles.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.589
And so this must be a rhombus.
