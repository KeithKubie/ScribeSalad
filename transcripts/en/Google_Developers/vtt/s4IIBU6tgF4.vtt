MARY RADOMILE: Welcome to
Google Developers Live.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.430
My name is Mary Radomile.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.360
I'm here with the Google
Open Source Programs Office.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.180
And today we are meeting
with Ian McDonald, who

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.500
is going to tell us a little
bit about his experience

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.870
with Google Summer
of Code as a student.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.160
Welcome Ian.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.200
IAN MCDONALD: Thank you.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.616
MARY RADOMILE: Can you tell
us a little bit about yourself

00:00:24.616 --> 00:00:26.714
and the project
that you worked on?

00:00:26.714 --> 00:00:29.380
IAN MCDONALD: Yeah, so, like you
said, my name is Ian MacDonald.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.270
I'm a software engineer
here at Google now.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.190
And I graduated from
McGill University.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.980
The organization I work
with is called Kernel.org,

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.720
which is the Linux
Kernel Archive.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.620
MARY RADOMILE: So tell us how
you got involved with GSOC.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.190
IAN MCDONALD: So when I was
looking for jobs one summer

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.060
I went on Google and searched
"software engineering jobs,"

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.030
and managed to find the
Summer of Code website.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.490
And I sort of went
through all the materials

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.880
and figured out what
it was all about,

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.370
and submitted a
few applications,

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.571
and was accepted
to be a student.

00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:08.330
MARY RADOMILE: Great.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.420
Now tell us a little bit about
the application process itself.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.090
How long did that take you?

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.090
Was it difficult?

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.620
IAN MCDONALD: So the application
process for Summer of Code

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.420
is different from a lot
of other internships.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.640
It's very collaborative
between student and mentor.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.950
So you can submit your
application many times

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.090
beforehand and get
feedback from mentors,

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.450
which I think makes the
applications stronger,

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.965
and let's you meet your
mentors beforehand, get

00:01:34.965 --> 00:01:36.340
to know them a
little bit better,

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.040
decide if it's someone you
want to work with for a summer.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.551
And it also lets
you get feedback

00:01:41.551 --> 00:01:43.425
from the people who are
going to be reviewing

00:01:43.425 --> 00:01:46.130
the application, which
I think is very helpful.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.840
MARY RADOMILE: Absolutely.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.779
And you said that you ended
up working with Kernel--

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:51.820
IAN MCDONALD: Kernel.org.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:52.319
Yeah.

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:55.150
MARY RADOMILE: Kernel.org
Tell us about the project

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.257
that you worked on.

00:01:56.257 --> 00:01:58.090
IAN MCDONALD: So I
worked on a project which

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.850
was focused on
analyzing HTTP access

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.790
logs across many
different machines

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.300
and centralizing them into
one location where we could

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.410
do real time analysis on them,
and also look back at graphs

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.760
for things like answer
questions about who's accessing

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.430
the website, what sort of
things were they doing,

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.825
what does the traffic
look like there?

00:02:20.825 --> 00:02:21.700
MARY RADOMILE: Right.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.560
Very cool.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.830
And what about like a typical
day as a GSOC student?

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:26.870
What is it like for you?

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.290
IAN MCDONALD: So it's pretty
flexible, which is nice.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.360
I'm a bit of a late riser,
and so I would usually

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.780
work a few hours in the
morning, a few in the afternoon,

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.030
and then later at
night a bit more.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.800
And it's nice to have time off
in the afternoon to sort of go

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.430
and exercise is
what I like to do.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.180
And then I would usually
work a little bit

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.340
later into the night
just because it's quieter

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.095
and that's when I
can focus better.

00:02:50.095 --> 00:02:51.730
MARY RADOMILE: OK, great.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.510
How did you interact
with the organization

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.080
that you worked
with, and how often?

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.430
Were they in different
time zones or what

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.750
was your standard
mode of communication?

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.970
IAN MCDONALD: So we were
usually communicating

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.180
using a program called IRC,
which is Internet Relay Chat,

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.870
and there were three other
people who I was really

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.150
working closely
with as a student.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.054
And one of them lived
in the Netherlands

00:03:14.054 --> 00:03:15.970
actually, which was a
little bit inconvenient.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.520
We would have to talk a little
bit in the morning more.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.580
But the other two
were in North America,

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.900
not in the same time zone.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.110
And there are pretty responsive.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.190
Usually if I sent
a message to them

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.244
I would get a response
within 30 minutes or so.

00:03:32.244 --> 00:03:33.410
MARY RADOMILE: That's great.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.760
Now, what about your project
by the end of the term?

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.960
Are you still working
with the organization now?

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.870
How have you been
involved going forward?

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.080
IAN MCDONALD: So I'm not as
involved now as I was certainly

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.820
when I was a student.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.840
But I did do a
bit of work on it.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.700
I participated in Summer of
Code as a student two times

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.260
and then as a mentor once.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.302
MARY RADOMILE: Wonderful.

00:03:54.302 --> 00:03:55.843
IAN MCDONALD: And
I did a bit of work

00:03:55.843 --> 00:03:58.200
on it in the school years
between when I was a student.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.440
So you know I was still involved
a little bit, and obviously

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.300
enough to be a mentor at
the end of all of that.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.175
MARY RADOMILE: Great.

00:04:07.175 --> 00:04:07.890
That's wonderful.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.650
Now finally, is there
any gotchas or things

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.717
that you'd recommend
for other students who

00:04:12.717 --> 00:04:14.550
are applying to be in
Google Summer of Code,

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.600
and any tips or tricks
that you can provide?

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.183
IAN MCDONALD: Yeah,
so I guess the one

00:04:18.183 --> 00:04:21.240
tip I would have is
to get involved early.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.190
Because especially
when I was a mentor,

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.540
and you see the applications
and the students who

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.000
are sort of engaged
from the beginning,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.810
and asking questions, and trying
to learn about the project,

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.570
and also getting
feedback from mentors,

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.356
those are the applications
which are stronger.

00:04:39.356 --> 00:04:40.685
MARY RADOMILE: OK, great.

00:04:40.685 --> 00:04:41.930
Well, thank you so much.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.409
And thank you all for
coming and listening today.

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:45.950
My name is Mary
Radomile and I'm here

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.720
with Open Source
Programs Office.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.940
We'll see you next time.
