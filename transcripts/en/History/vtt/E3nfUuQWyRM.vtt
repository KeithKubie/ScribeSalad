[music playing]

00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:09.175
We took in this
2016 Indian motorcycle

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:11.553
that needed some mechanical
work and a brand new paint job.

00:00:11.553 --> 00:00:13.513
Now, the client
had a great vision

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:15.473
for some way cool
graphics on this thing,

00:00:15.473 --> 00:00:19.436
with skulls, and flames, and
some beautiful Native American

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:21.438
imagery on the gas tank.

00:00:21.438 --> 00:00:24.482
Shannon and Mike went above
and beyond on this motorcycle.

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:25.358
Come on out, Diane.

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:26.526
How are you?
- Good.

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:27.527
How are you?
- Good, good, good.

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:28.319
Tom, are you doing, brother?

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:29.028
Pretty good, man.

00:00:29.028 --> 00:00:30.280
All right.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.657
All right, our
clients Tom and Diane,

00:00:32.657 --> 00:00:34.909
they are here right now
to check this baby out.

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:37.787
So I'm going to drag Ryan
out of his turbinator cave

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:39.748
so he can enjoy some of
the fruits of his labor,

00:00:39.748 --> 00:00:42.125
because, man, this boy's been
stressing out over this thing

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:43.293
lately.

00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:44.335
He needs something
to smile about.

00:00:44.335 --> 00:00:45.295
You ride a lot?

00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:46.337
Yes.

00:00:46.337 --> 00:00:47.756
Been riding for a long time?

00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:49.215
- Since I was 12.
- Amen.

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:51.509
You are going to
go crazy on this.

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:53.636
Should we quit talking about it?
- I'm ready.

00:00:53.636 --> 00:00:55.096
Should we show this thing off?

00:00:55.096 --> 00:00:56.306
I want to get it outside,
see it in the light.

00:00:56.306 --> 00:00:57.515
Shannon, come on, man.

00:00:57.515 --> 00:00:58.349
Bring out that Indian.

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:08.151
Oh, my god.

00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:09.611
Holy [bleep]

00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:13.823
Oh, that looks amazing.

00:01:13.823 --> 00:01:16.743
DANNY: We took this
2016 Indian motorcycle

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:19.329
and covered it in a
coat a cobalt blue

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.831
that is so bright it
looks electrified when

00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:23.416
the sun hits it just right.

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:25.752
We added graphics of
flames, and skulls,

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:29.088
and a baby blue hand turned
leaf, and tricked out

00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:31.216
the tank with a sick
image of a skulled

00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:33.009
out Native American face.

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.012
We then topped off everything
with new mid-rise handlebars

00:01:36.012 --> 00:01:38.556
for comfort, and replaced
the fender and guards.

00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:42.393
Now this baby is as bad as
all get out and ready to ride.

00:01:42.393 --> 00:01:44.270
Oh, I can't wait till
my buddies see this.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.563
They're going to die.
- Oh, my gosh.

00:01:45.563 --> 00:01:47.023
Look at it.
- You guys soak it up.

00:01:47.023 --> 00:01:47.899
Man, take your time.

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:48.608
Take your time.

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:49.442
Holy cow.

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:50.944
It all flows.

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:52.654
The Indian on the tank
is exactly what I wanted.

00:01:52.654 --> 00:01:54.656
Ain't no factory
paint job anymore.

00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:55.532
No way.

00:01:55.532 --> 00:01:57.033
That is amazing.

00:01:57.033 --> 00:01:58.493
The team killed
it on this one.

00:01:58.493 --> 00:02:00.203
They really did.

00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:02.497
Those bars, your arms won't
get as sore and tired, right?

00:02:02.497 --> 00:02:04.582
I'm glad you guys
put the bumpers on it.

00:02:04.582 --> 00:02:05.959
You don't put that
bumper on there,

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:09.003
you might as well kiss
that thing goodbye.

00:02:09.003 --> 00:02:10.797
I really do like
the cobalt blue.

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:12.257
It's a beautiful color.

00:02:12.257 --> 00:02:14.259
You said you wanted
something that looks fast.

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:15.593
I figured the
fire's the best way

00:02:15.593 --> 00:02:18.513
to get some action
going on without dating

00:02:18.513 --> 00:02:19.556
the bike too much.

00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:20.890
That thing came out beautiful.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:21.850
You can't go wrong
with skulls and fire.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:22.809
It's gorgeous.

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:23.768
Buddy, I got to tell you.

00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:24.978
That is one hell of a job.

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:26.312
You hit it right
on the head, man.

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:28.398
I had a hell of
a team [inaudible]..

00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:31.651
And as long as you guys
are thrilled, we're happy.

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:34.153
It's about to go on a
3,200-mile ride right now.

00:02:34.153 --> 00:02:35.613
- Is it really?
- Really?

00:02:35.613 --> 00:02:36.906
Bought it to ride.

00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:38.783
Bro, I love it.

00:02:38.783 --> 00:02:39.993
Yeah, man.

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:41.911
I would like to see
y'all try it on.

00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:43.288
- You got it, man.
- Absolutely.

00:02:43.288 --> 00:02:44.205
You know what I'm saying?

00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:45.123
That's the best part.

00:02:45.123 --> 00:02:46.583
DANNY: It is.
It is.

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:47.584
He fits it perfect.

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:48.835
- Yeah, he does.
- Oh, man.

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:50.044
- Absolutely.
- He fills the bike out.

00:02:50.044 --> 00:02:51.629
I look tiny on it.
- Right?

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.590
How do those bars feel?

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.549
They feel great.

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.885
[engine revving]

00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:58.803
Pipes sound great.

00:02:58.803 --> 00:03:01.055
Yeah, man, test that baby out.

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:07.353
DIANE: Whoo.

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:09.272
Whoo.

00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:11.900
Man, that Indian
looks cooler moving

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.610
than it did standing still.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.529
I think it's very safe to say
that Tom and Diane are going

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:19.699
to get miles of smiles and a
whole lot of jealous bikers

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:23.453
as they cruise around
putting down 3,200 miles.

00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:25.121
I think they're happy, dude.

00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:26.122
I hope they come back, because
we still got a tab to pay.
