00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.400
Question: Why do people do horrible things?

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:09.980
Slave owners, and Nazis, any of the perpetrators
of history's atrocities. How do they so successfully

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.059
dehumanize other people for so long? At a
smaller scale, how do bullies in the lunchroom

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.970
manage to treat other kids with such cruelty
and then go home and pet their dog and call

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.740
their grandma and say "happy birthday?"

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.700
Most of what we've been studying so far has
focused on the individual. We've covered sub-fields

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.340
of psychology like cognitive, personality,
and clinical psychology, which tend to address

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.710
the phenomena contained within a single person's
mind. But there's also social psychology,

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.429
which focuses on the power of the situation.
It examines how we think about, influence,

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:42.609
and relate to one another in certain conditions.
And it's better equipped to answer this question

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.749
about people doing horrible things.

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:48.120
Social psychology can not only give us some
of the tools we need to understand why people

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.999
behave brutally, it can also help us understand
why we sometimes act heroically.

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:55.999
Like why did Jean Valjean reveal his true
identity to save some stranger from being

00:00:55.999 --> 00:01:00.870
tried in his place? And why did Nazi Oskar
Schindler risk his own hide to save over a

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.970
thousand Jewish people? What made Darth Vader
throw the Emperor down that hole, even as

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.540
he was being electrocuted?

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.200
I can't say there are any easy answers about
humanity's greatness or it's horribleness.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.730
Certainly, there aren't any that we can find
in the next ten minutes. But we can point

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.770
ourselves in the right direction, and it starts
with social thinking.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.940
When we're trying to understand why people
act like villains or heroes, one of the things

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.900
we're really asking is, "Did they do what
they did because of their personality? Or

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.990
their situation?" Austrian psychologist Fritz
Heider began plumbing the depths of this question

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.050
in the 1920s when he was developing what's
now known as the Attribution Theory.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.710
This theory simply suggests that we can explain
someone's behavior by crediting either their

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.020
stable, enduring traits - also known as their
disposition - or the situation at hand. And

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.330
we tend to attribute people's behavior to
either one or the other. Sounds pretty simple,

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.540
but it can be surprisingly hard to tell whether
someone's behavior is dispositional or situational.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.890
Say you see Bruno at a party and he's acting
like a wallflower all night. You might assume

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.069
that he just has a shy personality. But maybe
he doesn't; maybe he'd ordinarily be re-enacting

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.099
all the moves from Footloose at this party
but on this night, he had a twisted ankle

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:23.370
or a headache or he'd just seen his ex with
somebody new - those are all situational explanations.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.939
Overestimating the forces of personality while
underestimating the power of the situation

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:31.980
is called the Fundamental Attribution Error.
And as you can imagine, making this kind of

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.540
error can really end up warping your opinion
of another person and lead to false snap judgments.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.700
This might not be such a big deal when it
comes to Bruno and his awesome dance moves

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.569
but according to one study of college students,
7 in 10 women report that men have misread

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.509
their polite friendliness - which would be appropriate
for the situation - as a sexual come-on.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.849
We choose how we explain other people's behavior
everyday and what we choose to believe can

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.230
have big consequences. For example, our political
views will likely be strongly influenced by

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.889
whether we decide to attribute poverty or
homelessness to personal dispositions, like

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:10.069
being lazy and looking for a hand-out, or social
circumstances like lack of education and opportunity.

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.319
And these attitudes can, in turn, affect our
actions. Activists and politicians know this

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.260
well and they can use it to their advantage
to persuade people in different ways.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.739
In the late 1970s and 80s, psychologist Richard
Petty and John Cacioppo developed a dual process

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.719
theory of understanding how persuasion works.
The first part of their model is known as

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:32.879
the Central Route Persuasion and it involves calling on
basic thinking and reasoning to convince people.

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:36.849
This is what's at work when interested people
focus on the evidence and arguments at hand,

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.909
and are persuaded by the actual content of
the message. So when you're watching a political

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:45.409
debate, you might be persuaded by a candidate's
particular policies, positions or voting history.

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:47.379
That is, the stuff they're actually sayin'.

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:52.049
But we all know that persuasion involves more
than that. There is also Peripheral Route

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.099
Persuasion at work. This influences people
by the way of incidental cues, like a speaker's

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.790
physical attractiveness or personal relatability.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.830
There's not a lot of hard thinking going on here,
it's more of a gut reaction. So you might decide

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.440
to vote for a particular candidate because you think
they're cute or they're from your home town.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.819
Peripheral Route Persuasion happens more readily
when you're not paying a ton of attention,

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:15.409
which is why billboards and television ads
can be scarily effective. So that's how politicians

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:20.379
and advertisers and maybe bosses and teachers
and pushy friends try to change our behavior

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:21.879
by changing our attitudes.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.700
But, it turns out that the reverse is true
too. Our attitudes can be affected by our

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.440
behaviors. You might have heard about the
phrase, "Fake it till you make it." Meaning,

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:34.050
if you smile when you're actually sad the
act of smiling may carry you through an attitude

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.930
change until you actually feel better.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.419
Sometimes we can manipulate ourselves this
way, but it's also an incredibly effective

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.580
method people use to persuade each other.
It generally works best in increments, through

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.639
what psychologists call the foot-in-the-door
phenomenon. People tend to more readily comply

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:52.160
with a big request after they've first agreed
to smaller more innocuous requests.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.470
Like Darth Vader didn't just go from "Go get
'em Anakin," to Dark Lord overnight. He was

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:02.080
slowly enticed to the dark side, by a series
of escalating actions and attitude changes.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.520
Do this favor for me, now run this errand,
now kill these Padawans. Now blow up a planet!

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.889
What started this small actions went on to
become big ones, suddenly transforming Vader's

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:13.030
belief's about himself and others.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.520
There's plenty of experimental evidence that
moral action really does strengthens moral

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.780
convictions, just as amoral action strengthen
amoral attitudes. And there is perhaps no

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.940
better example of this than the Stanford Prison
Experiment.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.740
Back in 1971 Stanford psych professor Philip
Zimbardo and his team put an ad in the local

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.889
paper looking for volunteers to participate
in a 14 day experiment. After screening around

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:41.039
70 applicants, 24 male college students were
deemed physically and mentally fit enough

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:45.360
to participate in the study. For their troubles
they'd each be given $15 a day.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.000
The participants didn't know the exact nature
of the experiment, just that it involved a

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.889
fake prison situation. And with a coin flip,
half were randomly deemed prisoners and the

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:58.310
other half guards. The guards were told that
it was the prisoner's behavior that was being

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.419
studied. The prisoners weren't told much of
anything, aside from that they had been arrested

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:06.899
and taken to prison. Other than that neither
group had many specific instructions.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.979
Zimbardo wanted to observe how each party
adapted to their roles, and so, on a quiet

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:17.520
Sunday summer morning in Palo Alto, real cops
swooped in and arrested the prisoners in their

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.509
homes under charges of robbery. They were
frisked, handcuffed, and read their rights.

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:26.879
Back at the station, they were formally booked
and then blindfolded in a holding cell wearing

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:31.250
only hospital gowns. The researchers had taken
great care to make sure that the setting was

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.960
extremely realistic, which is one reason they
used real cops in the arrest before handing

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.560
the prisoners over to the fake guards. And
it took no time at all for this role-playing

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.300
to become really, really real.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.939
The initial trauma of the humiliation of the
arrest, the booking, strip-searching and waiting,

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:52.189
immediately kicked off a loss of identity
in the prisoners. A few prisoners only made

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:57.189
it through the first night before they became
too emotionally distressed and had to be released.

00:06:57.189 --> 00:07:00.930
Things only went downhill from there. Though
the guards could act any way they wanted as

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:05.379
long as they didn't physically hurt anyone,
encounters quickly became cruel, hostile,

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:09.389
and dehumanizing. Guards hurled insults and
commands, referred to the prisoners only by

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:14.280
number, and put some of them in solitary confinement.
Prisoners started breaking down, others rebelled,

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.840
and still others became passively resigned
as if they deserved to be treated so badly.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:23.110
Things got bad enough that the experiment
ended after only six days, causing relief

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:27.889
in the fake prisoners, while interestingly
leaving some fake guards feeling angry.

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:31.969
Luckily, everyone involved bounced back to
normal once out of the prison setting. All

00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:36.550
of those negative moods and abusive behaviors
were situational, and that fact reinforced

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:41.740
the important concept that the power of a
given situation can easily override individual

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:45.780
differences in personality. Although it would
never fly by today's ethical standards, Zimbardo's

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:49.949
famous study remains influential today because
it sheds such a harsh light on the nature

00:07:49.949 --> 00:07:51.560
of power and corruption.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:56.060
And yet, people differ. Many people succumb
and become compliant in terrible situations,

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.639
but not everyone does. Lots of people risked
their lives to hide Jewish people in World

00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:04.180
War II, help runaway slaves along the Underground
Railroad, keep Tutsi refugees safe during

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:08.669
the Rwandan genocide, or generally refuse
to comply or participate in actions they didn't

00:08:08.669 --> 00:08:13.199
believe in. Some people can, and do resist
turning to the dark side, even when it seems

00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:18.619
like everyone around them is going mad. And yet, 
the fact is, these people tend to be in the minority.

00:08:18.629 --> 00:08:24.030
So why? Why does it seem so easy to rationalize
a negative action or attitude and so hard

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:28.689
to muster the positive ones? One partial explanation
comes from American social psychologist Leon

00:08:28.689 --> 00:08:33.789
Festinger's theory of cognitive dissonance. It's one of
the most important concepts in psychology.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:37.680
Festinger's theory begins with the notion
that we experience discomfort - or dissonance

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.660
- when our thoughts, beliefs, or behaviors
are inconsistent with each other.

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:43.840
Basically, we don't like to confuse ourselves.

00:08:43.849 --> 00:08:47.889
For example, if Bruno was generally considered
a peaceful person but finds himself suddenly

00:08:47.889 --> 00:08:52.809
punching at his friend over a fender-bender, he's likely
experiencing some level of cognitive dissonance.

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:58.490
So, by Festinger's thinking, Bruno might relieve
this tension by actually modifying his beliefs

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:02.420
in order to match the action's he's already
committed, like telling himself, "Turns out,

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:06.100
I'm not such a nice guy after all, maybe I'm
actually a bully." On the other hand, he might

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:10.399
resolve his internal tension by changing how
he thinks about the situation. He might still

00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:14.790
think of himself as a peaceful person, but
realize that an unusual situation led to an

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:19.589
unusual action, like, he'd had a bad day and
it was his mom's new car, or his friend was

00:09:19.589 --> 00:09:25.089
just really askin' for it. So, he can keep
being the ordinarily peaceful guy he was before.

00:09:25.089 --> 00:09:28.620
It's kind of an inverted fundamental attribution
error if you think about it. Attributing a

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:32.700
person's actions mainly to the situation,
instead of his personality. The point is that

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:37.760
this mismatch between what we do and who we
think we are induces tension - cognitive dissonance

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:42.450
- and that we tend to want to resolve that
tension. That's part of what turns an Anakin

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:46.149
into a Darth Vader, and then, if we're lucky,
back into an Anakin.

00:09:46.149 --> 00:09:50.350
Today you learned that social psychology studies
how people relate to each other. We discussed

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:55.870
Fritz Heider's attribution theory, and fundamental
attribution error. You also learned how attitudes

00:09:55.870 --> 00:10:01.060
can affect actions, like through the duel-process
theory of persuasion, and also how behavior

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:05.740
can change attitudes, like through the foot-in-the-door
phenomenon. The Stanford prison experiment

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:10.520
illustrated how a situation can override individual
differences in personality, while Leon Festinger's

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:15.240
theory of cognitive dissonance explained how we ease
the tension between conflicting thoughts and actions.
