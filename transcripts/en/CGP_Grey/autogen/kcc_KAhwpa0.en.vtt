 History has a lot of traditions that predict the end of the world - all of them were suicidal - but so far 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.120
 There are some people who believe that 2012 is the end of the world 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.219
 Why 2012? Because of an ancient Mayan calendar (obviously) 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.770
 The Mayan calendar is not only recorded for days and years, but also for ages 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.250
 5 Fiat. If they can easily make a calendar go 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.230
 1000 years in the future. But of course 1000 years in the future 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.490
 From 1000 years ago bring us to the present when the Mayan calendar stops the year 2012 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.100
 People who think they are cultured through spiritual practices have decided that the wise Mayan people have stopped making calendar because they are 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.120
 Know that the world will end, because they are happy though 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.030
 Who are they Amion - but people have a view that 2012 was a great spiritual awakening 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.559
 Or re-operating the world - widening the irrationality of the Maya dwelling who spent time pulling out 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.039
 Throne chains through the year People probably did not have the idea 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:52.870
 For the average person the idea: that the end of the calendar means the end of the world 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.300
 Is a strange conclusion to think about. After all, the amount of time in the universe 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.430
 The stones are finite and limited, so at some point the Maya people must stop sculpting 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.600
 Calendars. But do not care 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.170
 What has to remain on the fringes of endorsement is turning into hysteria with 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.610
 The 2012 film, which swept the Academy Awards and many nominations for the Amy Awards for End of the World films 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.050

 History Channel 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.220
 After all, NASA became so immersed in this situation that they had to take time 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.910
 From their time of building robots and pushing and expanding knowledge 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.720
 And their civilized schedule to write a Web page explaining that no stone-age society can sacrifice human beings 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.229
 Without wheels to tow carts or glass for the manufacture of a telescope and do not know more about 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.550
 Science at the beginning of history more than scientists today 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.750
 But the review of the madness of the world on everything is a stormy and unpredictable prediction of the earth 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.270
 Including the reflection of the magnetic poles (a process that unfolds over a geological time, not one day) 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.479
 Geological time range, not one day) A set of Planet X puzzles 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.580
 No space scientist finds him a local star exploding (though 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.399
 Of the absence of any candidate). Space invasion (laughable 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.810
 It) and a time beam, no matter what 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.590
 Gomez. A reasonable man at this stage will wonder 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.390
 How the Mayan population that they could predict physical anomalies thousands of years ago 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.110
 And millions of miles away could not see the Spaniards coming from the Pacific Ocean (Atlantic) 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.720
 This is because the Mayans did not predict the end of the world. Only people who claimed to be Mayan residents 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.780
 They knew about the Apocalypse they clearly are not Mayans
