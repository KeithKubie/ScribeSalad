00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.819
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Here are some other points that form a vertical line. I want you to use the

00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:07.761
same sort of approach we used last time. Try and label these points and then

00:00:07.761 --> 00:00:11.725
figure out what's the equation for the line. Then I also want you to find the

00:00:11.725 --> 00:00:15.278
slope. You can put the number in this box or if you think the slope is

00:00:15.278 --> 00:00:17.543
undefined, write the letter u. Good luck.
