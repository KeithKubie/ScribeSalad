00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 in this capsule we will see how 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.990
 can we specify the structure 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.550
 a country network 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.280
 so we have seen previously commented this 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.049
 that we could estimate the stage of 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.730
 probability of a BÃ©zian network for a 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.560
 new problem for which we want 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.600
 use networked now this 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.539
 what are we going to see? 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.560
 can derive the network structure for 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.560
 a given problem 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:32.850
 so a first approach that is 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.329
 perhaps the simplest in terms of 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.180
 work to do is to do it at the 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.250
 hand so we do six does not approach who is 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.809
 simple to the extent that if one does not have 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.950
 many variables to model it's 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.789
 perhaps simpler than having to 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.090
 collect data 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.190
 so what do we do the procedure that we 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.440
 could follow knows we enumerate 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.210
 all of our xange variables 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.280
 icaic scene we want to use for 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.350
 model another environment that one 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.010
 will choose an order among these variables 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.799
 so and that could be in our 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.340
 example of talent and that it could be 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:12.750
 if a burglary and kz2 after two 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.659
 earthquakes and insidious and now of the 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.180
 first variable until the last 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.520
 alright i'm going to add the variable to my 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.580
 network was played in my structure 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.250
 of data that represents my network I 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.549
 will add the variable here to my 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.000
 network 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:33.540
 and here I will determine what should 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.460
 to be my parents from bixi to 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.610
 from the previous variables of the ex 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.409
 until eksi - so it's in others 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.860
 words what should be the parents 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:47.460
 such as who are they who made the 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:51.210
 conditional probability of maria bixi 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.479
 and gave all the precedents can get 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:58.110
 reduce as the priority of the six 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.090
 departures only from parents so in 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.869
 done at this moment if I'm trying to 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.430
 find out what are the independences 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.530
 conditional that I can afford to 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.479
 model then who are likely 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.880
 for my given problem 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:15.570
 so in fact making a choice 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.790
 which makes that I can start from the simple 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.190
 rule of chaining in a Bezier network 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.620
 to arrive at a formulation can more 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.060
 or the parties concerned 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.710
 I need it is only those who 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.330
 depend on the parents I will have chosen 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.530
 and therefore build a good network Beziers 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.630
 to the extent that represents 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.290
 well modelers our environment 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:40.050
 our problem is that its structure 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.300
 reflects conditional independence 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.020
 that make sense so that is reflected in 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:49.200
 my problem I have is to model 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:51.960
 and but in fact it's not the only one 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.660
 important part in the deliberation 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.150
 of structure it turns out that choosing 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.980
 the order in which I add but we 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.930
 are at the bezze network whose order 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.220
 in which I treat my different 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.230
 menus can I identify the parents 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.490
 it is also an important aspect of 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.900
 my procedure to describe the structure 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.270
 my network beziers who see an impact 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.980
 important on the end result is in 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.950
 do what we want to do is put in 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.080
 first root causes in the nude 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.600
 so the first draws in my art of 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.040
 variables I should put that 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.000
 I call the causes talks 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:29.340
 first in my environment 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.570
 pim is subsequently those who are 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.890
 influenced by these root causes so 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.900
 to illustrate the impact that this can 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.970
 have two hours of variables that is 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.740
 maybe not appropriate where I do not have the 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.650
 root causes first during our 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:46.050
 case our example with the soul system 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.700
 or rather than put burglaries and 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.830
 who are the features the causes 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.870
 roots I'm going to put in first husband 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.970
 call and call by sochaux 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.690
 I will watch alarm finally 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.130
 burglaries and earthquake there for the 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.780
 first random variable I do 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.180
 just the agitated so m 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.740
 but barely he adds in that if 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.410
 I have no choice but to finally do it 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.209
 no parent since no variables 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.970
 random 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.959
 now imagine that I add 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.180
 laboratory people barely 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.730
 and here I have to determine what are his 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.290
 parents is it by a cm or 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.359
 is what we do for my environment 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.210
 politics 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.500
 the distribution of j knowing m can be 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.099
 reduce as being just a 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.689
 distribution on j so basically I have to 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:33.240
 determine is knowing 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:35.759
 that marie called should influence the 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:40.919
 distribution on my verbal veracity I 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:42.509
 so call intimately I can not 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:46.199
 do this reduction there ie 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:50.129
 that knowing m is actually worth having a 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:51.659
 impact on the distribution of j so 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:55.409
 actually if i know that marie has 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:57.240
 called upon my prediction sure I 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:58.680
 call will not change to know that he 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.439
 are some good things that I called 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.729
 if I observe that marie called so 

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:06.689
 in what if I can not do this 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:10.800
 reduction there I can not choose that j 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:14.789
 have no parents I have to add as 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.699
 parent acted the wedding random variable 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:19.889
 so I'm going to have an arrow like that 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:22.159
 we consider my third variable 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:25.349
 random at hand is what he 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:27.330
 should have as parents I have m so 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:29.849
 the two previous labs where is 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:33.169
 what can I reduce his only j or 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:35.550
 to have absolutely no independence 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:38.819
 when if I can not do it 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:42.300
 reduction actually if I observe 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:43.650
 firstly that marie called ya 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.509
 good chances whether it's because 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.360
 the alarmed was triggered 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:51.449
 so I want at least conditioned pops up 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.699
 now if pardon on marie pie xi in 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:55.740
 plus I observe that jean apps additionally 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:57.960
 to have served that mary to pleyben that me 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.660
 strengthens 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.990
 the prediction that there really was 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:07.380
 one to the dance that if I have to have my 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:10.430
 two arrows like this here we look 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:13.860
 for the 4th random variable 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:16.139
 burglary do I have to 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.400
 conditioned on the three variables to the 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:19.680
 previous times where can I 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.389
 reduce to only the soul or is this 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.139
 that in fact she is independent of 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:26.460
 alarm 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:30.300
 I call and marry call when if 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:32.280
 it's reasonable to say that I can 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.979
 condition only on the soul but 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.270
 why jean and marie actually they 

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:38.280
 only observe the tear 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.830
 he also does not observe a burglary or 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.740
 or not so if I observe that an alarm 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:45.270
 marie and jean 1 map is not over 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.830
 of observation then what they observe 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.050
 not directly burglaries you 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.610
 just watch there so do this 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.979
 reduction there is appropriate 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:55.949
 now I can not take away the soul 

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:57.509
 because actually if I know 

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:58.889
 that an alarm that has a lot more than 

00:06:57.509 --> 00:07:02.789
 chances he had a burglary that 

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:05.099
 if there was none at the so I'm going 

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:07.620
 add only an arrow to the soul 

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:13.729
 to burglaries and finally my 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:15.949
 last random variable s6 so 

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:18.509
 all the previous values ââthese 

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:20.130
 burglaries alarm jean pierre marie 

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:23.940
 call can I reduce it to 

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:25.620
 only the province only to 

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.990
 love or do I have to 

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:33.120
 conditioned on the fact that had a 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:35.759
 burglary or not when not 

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.979
 conditioning on burglaries it reflects 

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:40.889
 very badly actually my environment my 

00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:44.430
 application so for example if I know 

00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:47.219
 that an alarm but that in addition I observe 

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:49.680
 that there were no burglaries but 

00:07:47.219 --> 00:07:53.490
 so it strongly reinforces 

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:55.979
 my prediction that there was indeed a 

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:58.349
 earthquake then the opposite 

00:07:55.979 --> 00:07:59.449
 well if I observe that an alarm is that a 

00:07:58.349 --> 00:08:02.580
 burglary 

00:07:59.449 --> 00:08:04.240
 well it's probably not because a 

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:06.699
 earthquake that 

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.319
 there was an alarm so it's more 

00:08:06.699 --> 00:08:08.889
 likely that they did not have any 

00:08:08.319 --> 00:08:11.470
 earthquake 

00:08:08.889 --> 00:08:12.220
 so observing besides who has 

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:15.759
 had a burglary 

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:17.199
 in addition to the fact in addition to observe if 

00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:19.780
 an alarm my post at my door of 

00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:22.389
 information that should influence the 

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:25.389
 conditional distribution of earthquake 

00:08:22.389 --> 00:08:27.430
 so in this case I'm going to have I 

00:08:25.389 --> 00:08:30.099
 will have a burglary addiction 

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:37.029
 and earthquake in addition to a dependency of 

00:08:30.099 --> 00:08:38.830
 alarm to earthquake so in fact 

00:08:37.029 --> 00:08:41.709
 determined the conditional independence 

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:44.470
 it's not intuitive at all 

00:08:41.709 --> 00:08:49.899
 to do if we do not give back our variables 

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:50.950
 in a way that souls and more 

00:08:49.899 --> 00:08:53.680
 is that if we wanted to try 

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:55.420
 to infer the name of an expert from 

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.490
 determine what are the probabilities 

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:59.980
 conditional 

00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:02.050
 in practice we also find that cdh 

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:04.870
 felt like that by thinking about them 

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:06.580
 tables to enjoy the step of pro liter 

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.720
 conditional in the non-causal sense 

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:09.520
 it's also something that is 

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:14.440
 difficult it's actually it's been a 

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:15.399
 measure it in medicine or experiments 

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:18.520
 tendency to find it easier 

00:09:15.399 --> 00:09:20.529
 to prioritize pathologies 

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.959
 to symptoms so in the sense that 

00:09:20.529 --> 00:09:24.089
 know that in this sense diagnosis in this 

00:09:22.959 --> 00:09:27.370
 reverse 

00:09:24.089 --> 00:09:28.930
 and in addition another benefit of good 

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:33.010
 orderly our random variable at the beginning 

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:35.950
 in a causal sense therefore causes 

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:37.480
 roots to the random variables 

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:40.480
 which are rather effects of the causes 

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:42.550
 roots is that networks bgc we're going 

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.829
 derive as if they are going to have less of 

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:48.100
 settings we're going to have fewer arrows 

00:09:44.829 --> 00:09:52.149
 actually we observed earlier that we 

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:55.990
 did not have a network that had the form 

00:09:52.149 --> 00:09:59.770
 as we saw at the very beginning to know 

00:09:55.990 --> 00:10:01.720
 this form here actually we 

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:03.760
 had more arrows where we had 

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:06.459
 an arrow like that then an arrow 

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:09.070
 like that and that's because here 

00:10:06.459 --> 00:10:11.889
 rather than having burglaries and 

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:14.379
 earthquake we had instead 

00:10:11.889 --> 00:10:17.439
 we had instead marie calls them 

00:10:14.379 --> 00:10:18.910
 people what is the consequence of everything 

00:10:17.439 --> 00:10:21.480
 is that at the notable end of probability 

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:24.129
 which contain more parameters so 

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:25.600
 are going to be bigger so another 

00:10:24.129 --> 00:10:26.290
 advantage of putting the variables in a 

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.509
 the right order 

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:31.119
 it may be to have disobeyed more 

00:10:28.509 --> 00:10:33.279
 simple with fewer arrows less than 

00:10:31.119 --> 00:10:34.389
 less dependency links between 

00:10:33.279 --> 00:10:37.230
 variables and therefore tables of 

00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:37.230
 smaller probability 

00:10:38.609 --> 00:10:43.419
 now what are we doing his opa 

00:10:41.949 --> 00:10:47.079
 axeans explains that we give a 

00:10:43.419 --> 00:10:50.139
 good network structure beziers ben a 

00:10:47.079 --> 00:10:51.639
 little as we suggested before we could 

00:10:50.139 --> 00:10:53.949
 extract probability tables to 

00:10:51.639 --> 00:10:55.329
 from data one could perhaps 

00:10:53.949 --> 00:10:57.999
 also to do the same thing so 

00:10:55.329 --> 00:11:00.040
 to use an adaptive algorithm for 

00:10:57.999 --> 00:11:02.319
 derive the structure of the network bÃ©ziers 

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.649
 had an approach that works rather 

00:11:02.319 --> 00:11:06.359
 well 

00:11:02.649 --> 00:11:08.439
 it's about doing local research 

00:11:06.359 --> 00:11:10.209
 inspired or in fact that it corresponds 

00:11:08.439 --> 00:11:12.399
 basically had to say yes when we say 

00:11:10.209 --> 00:11:13.569
 we saw when we talked about 

00:11:12.399 --> 00:11:17.290
 local search in capsules 

00:11:13.569 --> 00:11:20.199
 previous so an algorithm that 

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:23.049
 could use is to start with 

00:11:20.199 --> 00:11:24.309
 an acyclic graph but random so 

00:11:23.049 --> 00:11:26.619
 among others but variable my 

00:11:24.309 --> 00:11:29.290
 network i'm going to put arts when 

00:11:26.619 --> 00:11:31.299
 minutes randomly making sure 

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:34.959
 on the other hand that my network beziers and 

00:11:31.299 --> 00:11:36.759
 corresponds a serious which is cyclical to 

00:11:34.959 --> 00:11:38.799
 those of that from my data I 

00:11:36.759 --> 00:11:40.660
 will be derived the probability stage to 

00:11:38.799 --> 00:11:41.860
 from the relative frequencies of which I 

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:43.720
 pose the tail in that if I have 

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:45.519
 collected observations 

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:48.459
 then from the observations I can 

00:11:45.519 --> 00:11:50.499
 estimate table to enjoy as being 

00:11:48.459 --> 00:11:52.929
 relative frequencies to part of the 

00:11:50.499 --> 00:11:54.730
 relative frequencies breakthrough of that we're going 

00:11:52.929 --> 00:11:57.039
 start local search where are we going 

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:59.709
 generate successor graphs with 

00:11:57.039 --> 00:12:01.839
 arches a little different and for each 

00:11:59.709 --> 00:12:04.509
 serious successor I will stay but 

00:12:01.839 --> 00:12:07.389
 the probabilities step and then I'm going 

00:12:04.509 --> 00:12:09.639
 replace my current graph with my 

00:12:07.389 --> 00:12:11.499
 successor graph if the best according 

00:12:09.639 --> 00:12:12.970
 certain criteria and I'm going to talk about 

00:12:11.499 --> 00:12:16.029
 this criterion there in a few moments 

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:18.129
 and so as in local search well 

00:12:16.029 --> 00:12:20.679
 I'm going to bury myself like that by the way 

00:12:18.129 --> 00:12:22.419
 from a running graph to a better graf 

00:12:20.679 --> 00:12:24.320
 and doing several operations 

00:12:22.419 --> 00:12:27.830
 until I can not get better 

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:29.030
 the quality of my arm to run this 

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:34.790
 algorithm years it's going to take me a 

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:37.790
 notion of a successor graph and 

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:39.640
 possible choices of two ways to 

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:42.770
 generate successor graphs that would be 

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:45.530
 to add an arc to my current graph or 

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:49.550
 to delete an arc to my current graph 

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:51.560
 or to reverse an arc in my guy 

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:53.150
 running so for example if that was it 

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:55.760
 my current graph here I can 

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:58.610
 decide to adjust a bow like that I 

00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:02.720
 could have decided to remove the bow here this 

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:05.300
 who would give the network bÃ©zy here I 

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:07.640
 may decided to reverse the arc here 

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:10.520
 that they swallow loeb directions that 

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:12.800
 now is reversed like that so 

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:14.240
 for all the possibilities of adding 

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:17.690
 suppression of inversion game could 

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:20.120
 generate a successor graph then all 

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:24.130
 consider them take the one who has the 

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:27.530
 best criterion who is the best who 

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:29.090
 best reflects my data has gone to 

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:30.230
 this graph the luther support is like that 

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:33.140
 until I can not improve 

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:35.510
 my graph that would correspond to 

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:38.450
 biking like bing research 

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:40.370
 local green green bing to generate the 

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:47.060
 better structure of my network 

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:49.520
 beziers so what functions objective 

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:52.070
 finally use by my search for 

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:54.050
 then bing an objective function that is 

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:57.040
 often used corresponds to a 

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:57.040
 combination of two things 

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:03.380
 it's the combination of the rag 

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:04.700
 probability of my data - the 

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:07.160
 complexity of graffiti 

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:12.140
 so I'm just going to explain the notation 

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:14.720
 so that I note x1 t up to xmt with 

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:17.300
 a little excess though as being the tm 

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:22.670
 given in my dataset that 

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:26.090
 I collected so you try the number 

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:27.920
 of my given then exported jk ex mtc the 

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:29.720
 values ââof but random variable and 

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:32.270
 that up to xn in this umpteenth 

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:34.670
 give peace m 

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:37.699
 it may be the number of parameters 

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:40.939
 in my probability tables which 

00:14:37.699 --> 00:14:44.480
 we move back to encode all of my 

00:14:40.939 --> 00:14:46.339
 conditional priorities and so like 

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:48.619
 objective function 

00:14:46.339 --> 00:14:50.209
 what I want to do with it I want 

00:14:48.619 --> 00:14:52.779
 maximize my objective function in this 

00:14:50.209 --> 00:14:55.699
 this one so I want a network that 

00:14:52.779 --> 00:14:56.509
 assigns high probability to my 

00:14:55.699 --> 00:14:59.660
 comments 

00:14:56.509 --> 00:15:01.839
 ok so since the log is a 

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:05.119
 function that is growing 

00:15:01.839 --> 00:15:07.790
 if I had to maximize the sum on all 

00:15:05.119 --> 00:15:08.749
 my loch data of the probabilities of 

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:10.279
 my observations 

00:15:08.749 --> 00:15:11.749
 it's the same as maximizing 

00:15:10.279 --> 00:15:13.579
 finally the probability of all my 

00:15:11.749 --> 00:15:15.319
 observations standards and give so 

00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:16.579
 looking for a structure that allows me 

00:15:15.319 --> 00:15:18.290
 to assign the highest probability 

00:15:16.579 --> 00:15:19.040
 possible to all my data in my 

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:22.329
 dataset 

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:25.730
 but I will pay a price 

00:15:22.329 --> 00:15:28.519
 associated with the complexity of my network 

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:31.970
 bezers ie the number of 

00:15:28.519 --> 00:15:34.220
 parameters and in fact we notice here 

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:38.529
 that I also have a penalty that 

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:43.279
 depends on the log of the number was to give 

00:15:38.529 --> 00:15:45.739
 so among other things the idea here is that 

00:15:43.279 --> 00:15:48.529
 this term there plus I gave more is going to be 

00:15:45.739 --> 00:15:50.209
 important this term here here more I give 

00:15:48.529 --> 00:15:51.859
 more importance but the increase is going 

00:15:50.209 --> 00:15:54.739
 to be less big here to see a 

00:15:51.859 --> 00:15:56.329
 haunted linear increase while 

00:15:54.739 --> 00:15:57.889
 here we see an increase the guy 

00:15:56.329 --> 00:15:58.879
 rhythmic art and therefore as you go 

00:15:57.889 --> 00:16:01.279
 I collected data 

00:15:58.879 --> 00:16:03.410
 this term is going to be less and less 

00:16:01.279 --> 00:16:05.059
 important in relation to this term there so 

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:07.609
 the more I gave that I can afford 

00:16:05.059 --> 00:16:10.429
 to have a complexity a number of 

00:16:07.609 --> 00:16:12.499
 parameters m which is high but by 

00:16:10.429 --> 00:16:15.889
 against I always paid a price and 

00:16:12.499 --> 00:16:17.629
 so intuitively the tag is what this 

00:16:15.889 --> 00:16:19.759
 algorithm did it is that we 

00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:21.109
 looking for a serious one that explains the 

00:16:19.759 --> 00:16:23.419
 data that is to say that gives them to 

00:16:21.109 --> 00:16:25.789
 priorities but that's compact it's up to 

00:16:23.419 --> 00:16:29.239
 say who has the least parameters 

00:16:25.789 --> 00:16:31.669
 possible and this combination the here in 

00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:33.769
 train run to enjoy the data is 

00:16:31.669 --> 00:16:36.169
 a term of complexity of my network 

00:16:33.769 --> 00:16:37.910
 beziers it's a combination that's 

00:16:36.169 --> 00:16:40.519
 often used in practice then who 

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:42.439
 works well so I will not go anymore in the 

00:16:40.519 --> 00:16:43.399
 detail for this algorithm I wanted 

00:16:42.439 --> 00:16:45.019
 especially in fact you give a 

00:16:43.399 --> 00:16:46.939
 intuition about commenting what we can 

00:16:45.019 --> 00:16:48.360
 infer the structure of a Bezier network 

00:16:46.939 --> 00:16:51.180
 with 1 

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:52.980
 local search gray this is another 

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:54.420
 beautiful application of the paces of 

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:56.279
 local search but in the context 

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:58.800
 Bezier networks and to find out 

00:16:56.279 --> 00:17:01.410
 I invite you to read section 20 

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:03.769
