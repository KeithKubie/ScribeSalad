00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.270
So there's still one more feature that you could

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.980
add to your project to round out functionality for

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.820
registering for a conference. Once you've registered, you can't

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.730
actually unregister. So even though the UI shows us the

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.740
Unregister button, users can't actually click it to unregister,

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.060
because you haven't written the functionality to unregister the

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.560
user from a conference. It's up to you if

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.370
you'd like to go ahead and implement the unregister functionality.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.420
Feel free to add the function unregisterFromConference and

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.930
put it in conference API if you'd like. I'm

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.530
going to leave you to do this on your

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.610
own if you want to. Couple things, though, I

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.720
do need to point out, is that the

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.320
UI is expecting the function to be called unregisterFromConference

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.800
and it is expecting it to throw these exceptions.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.320
One other thing here is we have an @Name("websafeConferenceKey"),

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.660
so this function knows to expect the web safe conference

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.370
key to be passed to the function, and if you go

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.780
to the API's explorer, you'll see that it offers the

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.710
websafeConferenceKey field for you to enter the value if you want.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.300
Anyway, it's up to you if you'd like to go

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.230
ahead and implement this function. But it does tie together a

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.220
lot of the concepts that you've learned such as using

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.730
transactions and getting an entity by key and changing property values.
