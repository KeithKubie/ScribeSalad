00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.270
&gt;&gt; Alexander Russo: Okay.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.900
Why don't we get started?

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.730
I have a. At the
request of Josh,

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.830
I have a brief announcement
that all the, the only open

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.810
and unlocked restrooms are
by the registration desk.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.640
So, you shouldn't freak out
if you encounter a locked one.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.200
I don't know if he's here.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.870
He's probably putting
out flyers somewhere.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.430
But I think I also
wanted to mention

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.920
that if you see him today, to
acknowledge the amazing amount

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.870
of work that he's done to put
together, not just this one,

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.030
but the previous
task force conference

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.200
and all the amazing stuff
that we are encountering here.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.050
I don't know about
you, but as you hear,

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.390
as you can hear I definitely
conference voice, right,

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.690
which tells me that
there were lots

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.710
of good conversations
that were had.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.220
So, I'm Alex Russo.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.150
I teach at the Catholic
University of America.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.650
And I'm incredibly
humbled to share this stage

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.980
with two scholars, alright,
who have defined radio studies

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.980
for the past 30 years.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.990
I would imagine that
every person

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.670
in this room has been
influenced by their work

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.340
in one way or another.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.910
So, to introduce them
in alphabetical order.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.220
Susan Douglas is the Catherine
Neafie Kellogg Professor

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.110

of popular publications and
radio and television programs.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.220
She served on the board of the
George Foster Peabody Awards

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.970

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.320
And in 2010 was selected
as Chair of Board.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.630

of technology to an individual
who has greatly contributed

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.990
to the history of technology
through research, teaching,

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.160
publications and
other activities.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.010
Michele Hilmes is Emerita
professor in the Department

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.400
of Communication Arts at the
University of Wisconsin Madison.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.480
Her work focuses on media
history and historiography,

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.780
particularly in the areas

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.580
of transnational media
and sound studies.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.340
She is the author of four books.

Network Nations,
Transnational History of British

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.050

of American Broadcasting
Only Connect, which is now

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.790
in its fourth edition
as of 2013.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.160
She is also the editor or

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.440
She was the 2013 and 14
Fulbright Research Scholar

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.080
at the University of Nottingham.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.490
And this year, she
was the recipient

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.250
of the Distinguished Career
Award from the Society

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.860
for Cinema and Media Studies.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.720
So, I knew, we both, all want

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.620
to hear what these
folks would like to say.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.920
So, I think they're
going to speak

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.950
for 15 minutes or thereabouts.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.660
And then, we'll open the
floor up for discussion.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.670
&gt;&gt; Susan Douglas:
Thank you, Alex.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.360
I too want to thank
Josh Shepard,

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.690
the extraordinary Conference
Director, for putting together

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.280
such an amazing gathering really
that brings people together

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.650
from different, yet deeply
interdependent professions,

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.090
who all have that
radio gaga spirit.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.400
And rely so crucially
on each other.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.740
They aren't enough conferences

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.290
that bring together
practitioners, archivists,

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:44.610
educators and scholars.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.510
So, kudos to Josh for organizing
this amazing gathering, right?

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:56.910
[ Applause ]

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.290
Now, we are all here today
and so many of us and at 9 AM

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.400
on Saturday to affirm

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.390
that despite the overwhelming
visual bias of American history

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.420
and media history
through our textbooks,

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.550
television documentaries,
web pages and films,

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.510
we insist on the
importance of sound.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.930
And the powerful and sometimes
dominant role of sound

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.840
in our national life,
past and present.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.930
We are especially
interested in how sound

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.020
and listening create
communities, imagined

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.280
and otherwise, dominant
and subaltern.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.120
How they cultivate intimacy
and individual, regional

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.930
and national identities and have

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.130
and can affirm marginalized
identities.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.470
We seek to remind folks in
this visually overloaded age

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:53.100
that radio revolutionized the
perceptual habits of a nation

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.820
by bringing orality to the fore.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.370
It forever blurred the
boundaries between the private,

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.970
domestic sphere and
public commercial life

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.500
and political life.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.060
It made listening to
music a daily requirement

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.840
for millions of Americans.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.530
Even after TV, radio
remained a thriving cultural

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.420
and political force.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.760
We are also here to insist
that yes, radio matters,

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.730
radio history matters, but
also history itself matters.

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.600
With all of the interest
in media

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.080
and communication studies
today, in the uses and impact

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.320
of big data, social media,

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.740
everything in our
digital environment,

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.070
presentism is getting a
pretty big grip on our field.

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.660
And media history
is being minimized.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.630
I think we should challenge this

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.220
and championing radio history
remains an ongoing mission.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.920
And we are at an
interesting juncture here.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.500
Who would've thought five years
ago that listening to stories,

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.880
mysteries, politics without
images would reemerge

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.800
as a popular and
widespread practice.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.440
And then Serial happened in
2014 and it became a word

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.270
of mouth phenomenon
across generations.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:15.920
I learned about Serial
from 20 somethings.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.510
And now, we have
multiple true crime

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:21.780
and murder mystery
podcasts, political podcasts,

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.860
like Pod Save America
and Love it or Leave it,

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.110
journalistic podcasts
from the New York Times.

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:31.910
Even politicians are seeking
to host their own podcasts.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:35.910
They are luring people into
listening and imagining again.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.050
Will these be saved as part

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:41.730
of this distinctive national
moment, or will they evaporate

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:46.290
into the ether, like so many
previous sound broadcasts.

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:50.540
Everyone here knows how we
have had to be and still have

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:55.590
to be detectives in locating
archives, audio and print some

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:58.340
of them quite motley
and incoherent

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.500
and to discover what's in them.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.490
We're learning at this gathering
how many more archives are

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:04.790
out there.

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:07.480
Some still being built
and preserved often

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.630
by indefatigable people.

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:13.970
Many of us in our work have
had to piece together what's

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:16.640
in everything from like
the Paley Center for Media

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.540
to Chicago's museum of Broadcast
Communications, to the Library

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.550
of American Broadcasting at
the University of Maryland,

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:25.810
to the Pacifica Radio Archives.

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:27.180
There is so many
more to, of course,

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.370
the Recorded Sound Research
Center here at the Library

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:32.000
of Congress, and many more.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.980
Many of these, though not
all, privilege the networks

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:37.940
and a centralized
national history.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.910
So, many recordings from local
stations were thrown away.

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:46.010
And yet, how many might still
be moldering in boxes somewhere,

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:48.970
probably in someone's garage.

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:50.920
Now, to tell our stories,

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.590
these archives were
just the beginning.

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.990
Radio and sound historians
have had

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:59.060
to contextualize audio archives

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.380
within the broader
printed historical record.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.480
And this is almost
always an archive we have

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.570
to build ourselves.

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:12.390
How many of us have in our
offices, basements, attics,

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:15.860
garages, our own radio archives?

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:20.360
Journalistic articles, copies of
fan mail, cassettes, interviews

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.680
and the like that we
have had to put together

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.020
and we can't bear to part with.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:30.510
These DIY archives help
us establish timelines,

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.120
assessed impact and
controversies

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.830
and helped us see the growing
intertextuality among sound,

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:38.360
image and print.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.950
These too are part of the
radio archives infrastructure.

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:46.620
Should part of our preservation
task be amalgamating these

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.500
archives that we
each have built?

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.610
Probably if we did, it
would fill the entire floor

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:54.540
of this building.

00:09:54.540 --> 00:10:00.840
Part of our preservation
task, also have to do

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:04.340
with preserving the oral
histories we collected.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.830
The audio interviews we've done.

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:11.080
I have at least two huge file
drawers filled with my archive

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.770
for Listening In,
merely 20 years old now

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.150
and I cannot bear
to throw it away.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:17.870
Who would take them?

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:19.270
Where would they go?

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:21.370
[Inaudible].

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:23.470
[Laughter].

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:27.110
So, where do, where does radio
studies seem to be going?

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:29.830
First, of course,
is the decentering

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:34.040
of the National Network story
and the golden age of radio.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:38.350
And the exhuming and preserving
of local and regional histories.

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:40.860
This conference, recent research

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.980
and the archives still
emerging document the crucial

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:48.200
and massively underappreciated
role that radio, especially,

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.800
but not solely community and
listener supported radio,

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:56.280
played in addressing and giving
voice to marginalized groups,

00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:00.970
including the LGBTQ community
as early as the 1970's,

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:04.900
indigenous first nations
communities, Chicano and Latinos

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.570
and African Americans.

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:10.340
More histories can and need to
be written about the connections

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:14.050
between such stations, this
kind of radio listening,

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:17.460
community building and
political activism.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.630
Also, we have to remember

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:24.090
that in 1971 the FCC issued
its primer on ascertainment

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:27.030
of community problems
by broadcast applicants,

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:32.020
what a euphonious title, which
gave detailed instructions

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:34.950
on how to determine
community needs.

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:38.710
Stations had to develop
an ascertainment procedure

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:40.470
that would document
the demographics

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:44.220
of the stations market, identify
what were called significant

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:47.800
community groups and
hold meetings with them

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.420
to discuss community needs
and propose programming

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.380
that would meet those needs.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.770
These had to be filed
with license renewals.

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:59.360
So, what were commercial
stations doing

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:04.580
in the 1970's before Reagan's
FCC rescinded these rules

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:08.440
that might also have covered and
given voice to underrepresented

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.290
and marginalized groups?

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:14.230
When we find them and we can
use these available clips

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:18.560
to teach our students about
radios unsung role here.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:21.980
And this is an important
way to link our colleges

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.960
and universities
commitments to diversity,

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:29.190
to teaching about previously
ignored histories that matter.

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:34.230
And I'm stealing a line that
Kathy Battles gave me yesterday.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:38.070
These broadcasts with their
community building functions

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:41.060
constitute, and this
is a quote from Kathy,

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.930
the prehistory of social media.

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:45.220
And she's totally right.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:48.820
That's maybe how we should
teach some of these materials.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.890
And let our colleagues
and ethnic studies,

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:54.570
sexuality studies
and other fields know

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:56.670
that they're out there.

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:58.900
Another possible
future is to continue

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:02.560
to study listening itself
from radios multiple modes

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.760
of address, the phenomenology
of listening,

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:10.680
to how we engage cognitively and
emotionally with what we hear.

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.840
How do we, ourselves
as researchers,

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.740
engage with audio archives?

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.330
We've come a long way
in the past 30 years

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.220
in developing analytical
frameworks

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:24.830
to conceptualize the role
and impact of radio and sound

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:28.300
on American culture, politics,
the economy and on racial,

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.930
class, ethnic and
gender identities.

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:33.630
But what would we
say our methods are?

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:34.930
Especially once we're

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:37.500
in the audio archives
and we're listening.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:41.730
For those of us who are, who
are humanities based scholars,

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:45.220
we don't have a tradition like
our social science colleagues,

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.090
in laying out in often
painstaking detail what our

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:49.850
methods are.

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:53.400
Yet, many of us have tried to
construct a kind of semiotics

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:57.680
of sound as part of our methods,
which don't really exist,

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:00.920
aren't terribly codified
and maybe can't be.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.270
Now, of course, we focused on
the content of radio broadcast,

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:07.940
its distinctive language,
its mode of description

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.360
on the development and
use of sound effects,

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:15.490
on music as a punctuating force,
on radio voices and as gendered

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:17.690
and raced and the like.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:20.550
In my own work, I sought
to develop an archeology

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:22.630
of listening, proposing
what types

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:25.580
of listening may have
emerged or evolved over time.

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:30.210
And how mode of address, tone
of voice, vocal acrobatics,

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:31.900
linguistic slapstick and the

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:35.310
like may have shaped
broadcasting practices

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:37.380
and listening repertoires.

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:41.050
Now, whether what I proposed
holds up, I don't know.

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:45.830
but sharing with each other how
we listen, what we listen for,

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:49.010
what we believe different
sounds signify

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:52.020
and what we think their
dominant, oppositional

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.560
and negotiated readings
might be,

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.730
might help elaborate our
collective understandings

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:59.520
of the semiotics of sound,

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:02.160
especially of radio
broadcasting.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.320
Another direction
for radio studies is

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:09.100
of course analyzing the
phenomenon of the podcast.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:11.470
You can barely keep
up with them.

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:13.890
And many are followed
by young people.

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:16.130
What other different
modes of address?

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:18.060
They're journalistic practices.

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.820
They're presentation of
different identities.

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:24.760
Now, I have one you might
find odd observation

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:30.810
that distinguishes some of them
absolutely from broadcast radio.

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:34.120
One thing about the few
podcasts I listen to, Love it

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:38.350
or Leave it, Pod Save America,
occasionally My Favorite Murder.

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:39.800
Do you guys know
My Favorite Murder?

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.430
Okay, yeah, yeah, okay.

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:46.750
Is the way they create intimacy
and bond with their audience,

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:50.810
in part by relying quite
frequently on the F word,

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:53.400
particularly as an adjective.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:57.100
These podcasts rely on a
combination of humor, political

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:01.840
and social commentary and
outrage and are geared primarily

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:05.080
to those in their 20's
and 30's, for whom,

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:09.170
at least in my experience, the
F word is one of the more common

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:12.950
and emphatic adjectives,
regardless of gender.

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:16.760
And it is used to convey
anger, disgust, outrage,

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:19.880
but also with an edge of
irreverence and humor,

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.440
as in that is fucking crazy.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.810
It almost always has
nothing to do with sex

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:30.460
and is rather an exclamatory
filler affirming defiance.

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.990
This would be impossible
on broadcast radio.

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:38.910
And its frequent use works to
create an in club of listeners

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:41.670
who don't care about
stodgy old forms of decorum,

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:42.970
censorship or [inaudible].

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:47.210
These broadcasts, these podcasts
are often staged before a live

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:50.830
audience, also to create
a sense of community.

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:53.240
So, radio and listening
are not dead.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:57.040
And podcasts are bringing
this new form of engagement

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.530
to a younger generation.

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:02.730
How they create intimacy is
just one of many questions.

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:05.150
But their affordances
are a bit different.

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:08.530
We listen when we want
with others or alone.

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:11.570
They are not constrained
by broadcast regulation.

00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:14.730
Knowledge of them spreads
primarily by word of mouth,

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:17.670
which is always such
a mysterious process.

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:19.900
How do we grasp this
new phenomenon

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:21.800
and its generational address?

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:25.000
How are gender and race
performed on these podcasts?

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.610
And have they more closely
connected the voices

00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:31.070
of young women to politics,
even though Love it or Leave it

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:34.520
and Pod Save America
are hosted by white men.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.750
And as we think about the
future of radio studies,

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:41.610
one framework can be our
wireless imagination.

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:44.070
How the imaginary about radio?

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:45.590
Who the audience is?

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:48.730
What radio was and
is meant to do?

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:50.670
How it connects with politics

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.120
and a longing still
for community?

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.420
As a through line

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:58.730
from wirelesses earliest
days up to the present.

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:02.260
Does radio studies include
services like Spotify,

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.020
Apple Radio, iTunes and Pandora?

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:07.550
And how music listening
has changed again

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:11.230
with these services,
with no DJ to hail us,

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:15.640
no ads if you pay enough,
songs and playlists selected

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:20.290
for you not by a DJ,
but by algorithms.

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:22.470
The AIing of taste.

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:25.550
I think this should be
part of radio studies too.

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:27.910
Finally, what is so striking

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:32.170
about this conference is
the enormous energy about

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:34.590
and commitment to embracing

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:37.730
and sustaining this
wireless imagination,

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:40.270
its history and its future.

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:41.570
And I look forward to hearing

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:44.130
where you think radio
studies is going.

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:45.930
Thank you.

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:53.140
[ Applause ]

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:55.390
&gt;&gt; Michele Hilmes:
I'll go over there.

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:59.370
I have a few slides, not many.

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:03.000
Now, woops, I got to.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.730
Can we bring my PowerPoint?

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:08.690
And here it comes.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:09.990
Yeah, there.

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:12.440
Okay, good, good.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.120
So, we. I think we're going
to have a little discussion

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.000
between ourselves,
because I am going

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.030
to start just a little
bit by talking about.

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:21.260
This is one thing that
Alex had actually suggested

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:25.920
as the convener of this session,
are, you know, our backgrounds,

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.350
which are similar,
but different.

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:29.700
And sort of what we
bring, what, you know,

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.810
originally many years
ago perhaps we brought,

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:35.120
Susan and I brought to the field
of radio studies and then how

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.830
that might affect,
you know, our vision,

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:40.740
which I think are very
similar, to where we are

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:42.140
and where we might go.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:45.180
But, I think the other
kind of task of this,

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.900
this session this morning was
to say okay, you know, we,

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:50.350
as Susan has just really
admirably described, we,

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:52.670
this field has grown
so enormously.

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:53.970
It's so great to see.

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:56.790
I mean, I can't even imagine a
group like this 20 years ago.

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:58.150
I mean, it just didn't exist.

00:19:58.150 --> 00:19:59.970
I mean look at all the people
in this room that have done

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:04.010
such fantastic work in radio and
sound studies and all the kinds

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:06.040
of different things
that Susan was saying

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:08.540
that our field has
expanded into.

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:10.080
I'm just going to
give a brief plus.

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:13.220
I'm pushing for that
term sound work.

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:15.450
Some of you have heard
me expound on this.

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:16.750
I've written on it.

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:18.050
You know, it's just like I know.

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:19.960
You know, how do you
get a new term induced,

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.440
or introduced into
the vocabulary?

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:24.230
But I think, I think we
need a term sound work

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:26.940
that would encompass radio
and I'm not erasing radio,

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:30.320
but that would factor in all
these other new forms and also,

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.640
you know, things that we don't
have a good way of talking

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.540
about now, like music
presentation.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:37.890
You know, music is one thing,
but how it's been presented

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:41.960
on the radio is a whole separate
kind of form in and of itself.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.510
So, I'm not going to go
down that rabbit hole.

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:45.630
Although, if you want to ask
me about it, I will talk.

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:48.250
But anyway, I couldn't
resist giving a plug

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:50.800
to this group in particular.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:54.480
So, when I thought about
what to say at the beginning

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.830
at the second day
of this conference,

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:59.210
in terms of going forward
in radio, I thought again,

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:01.260
you know, my background
is in the humanities.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.570
I came to the study
of radio through first

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:09.330
of all cinema studies at NYU
way back in the late 70's.

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:12.090
But before that, I was a
comparative literature major

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:14.840
at Indiana University,
working with Jim Naramore

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.140
and a few other people

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:17.490
that I think would be
known in this group.

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:19.540
And just at that
moment when I was there,

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:21.810
they had started a
film studies track

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:24.130
in comparative literature
and I took that.

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:26.290
And so, I was really coming from
this background and thinking

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:30.200
about texts and thinking
about modes of expression

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.610
and narrative structures
and things like that.

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:33.910
And, although, I
think, you know,

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:36.550
the other great thing is I think
some of you have heard me say,

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:40.340
is when cultural studies met
with media studies in the 80's.

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:44.420
And we began to think much more
deeply about issues of power

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:47.540
and identity and the
cultural significance,

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:51.480
the cultural activity
of media in our society,

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:52.980
you know that that
is a formative moment

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:54.280
that has shaped, you know,

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.360
so much of the work that's
been done in this room.

00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:01.400
But also, I like to think about
radio studies or sound work

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:05.090
as still centrally
studying texts.

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:07.450
I don't want to turn
lose of the idea

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:10.870
that radio has produced
these wonderful texts,

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:15.010
these formal constructed
expressions of meanings

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:18.430
of various kinds that need to
be analyzed in much the same way

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:20.880
that we've, you know, we analyze
film, we analyze literature.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.490
And I think as Susan
also suggested,

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:25.840
we're still in the
formative days of that.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.570
So, I want to go through.

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:32.460
I could, of course, you know,
in fact, now that I've retired,

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:36.410
I really, what I really love
doing and I do it all the time

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:40.060
through kind of interpersonal
networks is recommending all the

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:43.820
great work on radio that's come
out of the people in this room

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:45.710
and others since this
field has gotten started,

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:47.610
because there are so
many people out there

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:51.460
in other fields besides ours
that are looking to connect

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:54.000
with sound work now
[inaudible] exactly

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.930
of these new forms
that are out there.

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:58.670
People in the humanities,
people in the social sciences.

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:01.110
I get probably one
query a week by email

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:04.480
from somebody who's saying,
you know, I'm really interested

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.970
in the intersection
of theater and radio

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:09.520
and surely someone has
written about this.

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.190
You know, where's,
where's the book out there.

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:15.260
And I say, you know what,
there's some in the 40's.

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:17.720
You know, and there's some
really great work that touches

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:21.820
on that now, but it's a
literature waiting to built.

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:24.990
So, what I thought I would
like to do today is to kind

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:28.340
of give a shout out to some of
the ways that I think that we

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:33.150
as radio studies scholars
might work towards reaching

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:34.870
out to other fields
and I'm focusing

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:37.150
on the humanities myself,
but I think it's just as true

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:40.900
for the social sciences and for
other kinds of academic fields

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.120
to get the word out there of
this work that we're doing

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.360
and also of these
incredible archival sources

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.630
that we are discovering
that need to be heard.

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:52.020
And on a, as kind
of a side note,

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:53.590
although this is
something I hope we can talk

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:55.870
about in the discussion
that follows,

00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:59.410
how we can just communicate
amongst ourselves better too

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:00.710
about these.

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:02.010
You know, when we
come together, I hear,

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:05.430
I've heard about 15
archival collections at least

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:07.220
in the last day and a
half, you know, that were,

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:10.670
that I just can't wait
to explore further.

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:11.970
But I wouldn't have known

00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:13.840
about them unless I had
come here to hear people.

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:16.620
So how can we, you know,
just extend our reach?

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:19.460
So, I'm going to, I just
want to talk about some work

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:22.150
that I think, that has
come out of other fields

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:26.190
that is really interesting and
suggestive of how our research

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:28.910
and our archival
efforts can be of use

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:31.350
to scholars coming
from other areas.

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:32.910
And I apologize.

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:34.210
I would be.

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:35.900
I could talk about the
work that's just come

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:37.370
out of this room.

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:40.670
But I'm purposely going
outside for the most part to,

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:43.920
to focus on the work by
people who are not here today,

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.010
but would probably
really benefit from being.

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:47.310
Now, let me see.

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:48.610
There we go.

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:51.640
So, for instance, I want to give
the example of a student PhD

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:56.220
at Wisconsin from the English
Department at Wisconsin,

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:58.020
whose name is Lisa Hollenbach,

00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:00.690
who just got her doctorate
about two years ago.

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:01.990
And I wanted to put up.

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:04.550
Let me just tell
you what the, her,

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:07.920
the title of her dissertation
was Alternative Networks,

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:13.770
Recording and Broadcasting
American Poetry after 1945.

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:16.430
I think the dissertation might
be embargo because I can't,

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:18.130
I couldn't put my
hands on a copy.

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:19.940
But I'm sure it's
going to come out soon.

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:23.630
But she ah a really interesting
article if you'd like to read it

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:27.230
that came out in American
Literature, Sono-Montage,

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:29.860
Langston Hughes and
Tony Schwartz Listen

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:31.930
to Postwar New York.

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:36.130
So, this is a literature student
taking the field of poetry

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:38.900
and the poetry of Langston
Hughes in particular,

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:41.590
putting it together with the
sonic work of Tony Schwartz

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:44.690
and his portraits of New
York and looking at the kinds

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:50.300
of evocative sounds, the kinds
of structures of storytelling

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:53.720
that exist in those two
very different areas.

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:57.350
And, you know, making
this wonderful connection

00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:00.600
between the culture of the
1940's and it's, you know,

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:04.760
essential engagement with
radio and with recording.

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:07.920
Another example and this one
might seem a little abstruse,

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.060
but let me tell you it's
a really interesting book.

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:12.970
It's from a British scholar
called Amanda Wrigley.

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:16.670
And it's Greece on the Air,
Engagements with Ancient Greece

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:19.950
on BBC radio and this is from
the 20's through the 60's.

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:21.720
And it's not only
about Greek drama.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:24.140
Yes they put on, you know,
the BBC did all kinds

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:25.590
of Greek drama on air.

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:28.200
But also representations
of Greek culture,

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:31.430
the way that Greek literature
of various kinds kind of entered

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:35.000
into not only the
programs, but the basic ideas

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.180
of what drama was and how
poetry engaged with radio.

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:42.480
Again, you know, a humanity
scholar who came to radio

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.920
and really had learn
it from scratch

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.700
and is doing this kind
of interesting work.

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:48.620
I think there's lots
of colleagues

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:51.310
out in literature
departments and other kinds

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:57.100
of arts departments who would be
really, who need to hear from us

00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:58.870
and need to know what
we've been doing.

00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:00.990
Here's another example,
slightly different.

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:02.290
Simon Potter.

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:03.590
This is again, a Brit.

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:07.170
He's at the University
of Bristol.

00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:09.930
And he got into from
a background

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:14.030
in modern history this book
Broadcasting Empire, the BBC

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:15.550
and the British World.

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:18.450
Again, he was a person who
said, you know, I'm interested

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:20.490
in empire and the
structures of empire

00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:23.140
and how the British Empire
was built and established.

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:24.910
Radio was imperative.

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:26.390
How do I find out
more about radio?

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:27.690
Where are the resources?

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:32.030
And he went on from there to
and just put together a group

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:33.330
that he's running now.

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:36.180
It's a Leverhulme trust
supported research network,

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:39.970
connecting the wireless world,
writing global radio history

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:42.010
with a consortium
of scholars from,

00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:44.380
well a lot of different
countries.

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:46.940
So again, you know, this
kind of effort to reach out

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:49.840
and to broaden the
relevance of our field

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.510
and to support the
humanities at a time

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:54.280
when humanities is
being questioned

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:58.780
and in some cases undermined
by pointing to this vital field

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:01.220
of endeavor that
we're all engaged in,

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:05.390
I think is a really
important task for us.

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:07.310
So, and then secondly,
so the second.

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:09.790
So, this one thing reaching
outwards to other fields

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:13.290
and demonstrating the
relevance of our research.

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:16.820
The other thing, again touched
on before by Susan and by,

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:19.650
yeah I've been sort of harping
on this for a little while.

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:23.490
Maybe some of you have read
my Lost Critical History

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:26.850
of Radio essay, where I'm
talking about where is

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:28.870
that critical vocabulary

00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:30.970
that has been built
up in the other arts?

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:35.170
How do we talk about
radio texts as narratives,

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:38.560
in terms of the expressive
elements that are available

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:41.100
to us, in terms of their
relationship to other kinds

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.790
of genres and modes
of expression?

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:46.430
And I hope that most of
you are familiar by now

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:48.800
and if you aren't, I hope
you will become familiar

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:52.230
with the really great work
that Siobhan Mccue is doing

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:57.680
out of the University of Monash
Australia with Radio Doc Review.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.530
And that's small and I
don't know if that title.

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:00.830
Well, maybe you can see it.

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:02.400
Radio Doc Review.

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:06.200
I've just put up the
contents of the latest issue.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.620
And so for the last,
I think, two years.

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:10.600
This is an online journal only.

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:15.680
She's working with creators of
podcasts, of radio programs,

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:18.000
of different kinds
of audio work.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.140
And having them review other
peoples work and also reaching

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:24.400
out to scholars to do reviews.

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.870
You know, serious in
depth critical reviews.

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:29.550
I don't know if Jason
is here today.

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:31.700
But he has a review, as
you might see up there,

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:34.600
Jason Loviglio, of Criminal.

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.190
Isn't that a podcast that
some of you might know?

00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:41.630
And I also have to point
out that yes, Neil Verma,

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:43.440
I think, Neil, you may be the.

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.400
I had to make an
exception on Neil's behalf.

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:46.700
He's probably the only person

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:48.190
in the audience whose
work I'm mentioning,

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:50.220
even though you all
deserve mention,

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:53.800
because he has a really
fascinating two part essay here.

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.690
The Arts of Amnesia, the
Case for Audio Drama,

00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:59.230
where he really does this job
that I've just been waiting

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:02.220
for somebody to do, to
connect the kind of aesthetics

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:05.780
and central questions
and modes of radio

00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:08.250
from the earlier period
and podcasting today.

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:10.020
And it's a really
fascinating essay.

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:12.420
But, you know, Neil, I'm really
becoming worried about you

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:14.690
because you listen more.

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:17.310
You've listened to more radio
drama, as far as I can tell,

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:20.060
just quantifiably, than
any other person I know.

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:21.850
And like when do you do this?

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:25.690
You know? I know you have a, you
work, you have a demanding job.

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:26.990
You have a family.

00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:28.690
You know, I beginning to
think do you not sleep.

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:31.040
You know. Okay, good,
I'm glad to know that.

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.340
But, yeah.

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:33.640
What is that?

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:34.940
[Inaudible].

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:36.240
Oh, so he's just
constantly getting

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:37.540
through the fillings
in his teeth.

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:38.840
Oh, you know that is brilliant.

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:40.770
I've got to figure
out how to do this.

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:42.140
That's all I can say.

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:44.190
But it's really interesting
critical work.

00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:46.270
And I think Siobhan,
like on a shoestring

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:49.610
and getting very little
credit from her university

00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:53.140
because she has been involved
herself as a radio producer has.

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:54.850
It's a, I think, I
don't know how many.

00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:56.980
Well, it probably
tells me doesn't it,

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:58.390
what issue we're up to.

00:30:58.390 --> 00:30:59.690
Volume three, issue one.

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:00.990
I think it's four a year.

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:02.890
It's a really incredible
resource.

00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:06.870
I want then also say that
I've been really encouraged

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:10.970
to see other things, other
kinds of venues where people

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:15.020
who are doing kind of the, you
know, humanistic assessment of

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:18.800
and building up of a critical
vocabulary and repertoire.

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:21.220
And I hate to mention the
word cannon because I think

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:25.680
that it has such a negative,
you know, implication.

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:28.890
But to talk about like what
is really great radio work

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:30.190
that we should be remembering?

00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:32.110
And I think all of us have
our personal, you know,

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:34.490
little cannon that
we have in our head.

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:38.040
But its things like awards and
prizes and recognition that sort

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.960
of build this up
more publically.

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:42.710
And, of course, the Peabody has
been doing that for a long time.

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:45.580
And I've been on the, one of the
Peabody prescreening committees

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:47.980
for a couple of years,
a couple of years ago,

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:50.460
along with some people
in this audience.

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:52.330
And they're great.

00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:53.630
But they don't.

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:55.940
You know, it's a policy of
the Peabody's not to talk

00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:59.320
about the criteria, the
methods or anything.

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:00.620
Never to reveal.

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:04.440
Never to actually set
criteria except excellence.

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:07.100
Okay. You know, but,
you know, could we talk

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:08.400
about it a little more?

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:11.740
And I think that this is an
award called the Sarah's,

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:14.240
which comes from Sarah
Lawrence College.

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:17.540
And maybe some of you know about
it, where every year they have,

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:20.580
they give out a couple of
radio awards, bring people in.

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:23.040
And I have to, and they put
out, they also have a website

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:28.090
on which they publish
articles about the radio dramas

00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:30.530
and other documentaries
that they give awards to.

00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:31.830
And I want to point you

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:33.370
in particular the one I
found really fascinating,

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:36.150
because she was doing exactly
what I was saying somebody

00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:40.380
needed to do in the, in
the lost art of radio.

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:43.670
Sorry. I forgot the title
of my own article now,

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:45.160
but could you please
fill that in.

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.170
The Lost Critical
History of Radio.

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:49.710
And it's called Towards
the Poetics of Audio,

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:51.010
the Importance of Criticism.

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:52.960
And she's a producer,
not a scholar

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.060
and it's a really
interesting article to read.

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:56.360
I'd recommend it.

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:59.650
and then, finally, and I'm
probably wrapping up fast,

00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:01.600
which I think is good, because
one thing that we did want

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:02.900
to do here was, you know,

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:05.030
get more dialogue going
amongst ourselves this morning

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:06.840
since we have a little
time to do it.

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:10.680
How many of you know
about Radio Atlas?

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:13.280
You know, you know the old saw,

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:16.890
there are no subtitles
in radio, right?

00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:20.250
Which makes it hard for us to
listen out, to use a phrase

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:23.980
from Kate Lacey, a British radio
scholar, because the radio is

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:25.280
in different languages.

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:27.080
And unless we are really
familiar with the languages

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:29.820
that it's in, it's very hard
to listen to French radio,

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:32.600
to German radio,
to Assyrian radio.

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:35.200
We just cannot do that.

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:40.850
This is a effort of love
run by Eleanor McDowell.

00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:42.420
And she's a producer
of radio too,

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:45.220
working with Falling Tree
Productions, Alan Hall,

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:49.430
a really well known group of
producers that subtitles radio.

00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:52.190
You go online and there's
wonderful radio dramas

00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:54.220
from around the world and
you can listen to them

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:56.860
in the original with
subtitles running

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:59.450
so that you have a translation
of what is being said.

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:02.360
And it's, you know, she's
doing it on a shoestring.

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.720
She actually emailed me one
time and said, I don't know

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:07.440
if you know who I am, but I have
this Radio Atlas site, you know,

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:09.470
you know you might
find it interesting.

00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:12.130
And I said, oh I've
written about it.

00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:14.380
She's a. So, it's an
effort to kind of reach

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:17.790
across national boundaries
and linguistic difference

00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:20.920
and I think a really
promising thing for sound work.

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:23.840
And I'm using the term radio,
but I'll go back to sound work.

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:28.140
And it's future and its impact
in the larger intellectual

00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:29.740
and cultural universe.

00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:31.540
So, thank you.

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:39.760
[ Applause ]

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.850
&gt;&gt; Alexander Russo: Thank
you both, Michele and Susan.

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:44.060
I think there's former.

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:49.300
We had a brief conversation and
I think yesterday about this.

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:53.660
And what I think really came
out of it were both the ways

00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:57.830
in which I think we
share or both of these,

00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:02.680
or both of these talk share,
right, both are sort of focused

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:08.420
on the simultaneously, alright,
looking to the importance

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:10.450
of the past and the history,

00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:13.770
but also recognizing the
tremendous moment we are

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:15.310
in right now, right?

00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:18.480
The renaissance of sound
and its importance and sort

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:22.140
of centrality within
our larger culture.

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:25.710
So, that's one sort of way
of sort of both looking back

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:29.500
and looking forward, but
also the, the insistence

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:32.920
on both [inaudible] specificity,
alright, and certain ways

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:35.960
of talking about audio
and sound as sound, right?

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:39.090
But also the inherently
multidisciplinary way

00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:42.870
in which we need to look
at various kind of context

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:46.320
as radio cuts across
aesthetics and technology

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:49.890
and identify and economics.

00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:54.500
And so, I think this sort of
provides a really important way

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:59.350
for us to begin to, you know,
have our, have this conversation

00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:04.360
about where we will go
forward in radio studies.

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:08.070
And so, with that, I want
just to open it for questions

00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:10.870
that you guys had or if
you guys wanted to respond

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:12.170
to one another, if that would.

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:14.470
We could also do that.

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:19.640
&gt;&gt; Michele Hilmes:
Here's someone.

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:21.270
I'm not sure he's qualified

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:23.060
to ask a question here
[laughter] in this room.

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:24.390
Bill Siemering.

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:26.820
&gt;&gt; Bill Siemering: I
don't want to add to the.

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:28.740
I mean there's so many
things that [inaudible].

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:31.640
But I've been working
in radio and development

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:36.970
in developing countries and
there are studies on impact.

00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:40.960
This is where you still have
radio as a primary source

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:43.450
for over 80 percent
of the people.

00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:45.570
And it's transformative.

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:48.290
We know the story of
[inaudible] historically.

00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:51.980
But now, I've done case
studies of a radio station there

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:55.580
that has sponsored 40 live
debates in the last year.

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:56.880
&gt;&gt; Michele Hilmes: Wow.

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.220
&gt;&gt; Bill Siemering: And there
are radio listening [inaudible]

00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:00.210
and the engagement
of the community

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:02.020
with the radio stations
is quite amazing.

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:06.070
I just want to add one little
footnote from yesterday.

00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:10.470
I had mentioned this is a
radio, you know [inaudible].

00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:12.270
&gt;&gt; Michele Hilmes: Dammit.

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:43.200
[ Inaudible ]

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:44.770
How true.

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:47.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.830
I don't know, could
people hear that at all?

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:51.750
Okay. So, just to say,
just to summarize.

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:55.510
First of all, it was, oh jeez
I'm going to work backwards

00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:56.810
and then you'll help me.

00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:59.970
Some things like Chapter a Day,
really a precursor to audio,

00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:01.850
which was on, what
starting from the 20's?

00:38:01.850 --> 00:38:03.150
Wasn't it?

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:08.030
And also University of the
Air, yes like Ted Talks.

00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:11.700
So, kind of interesting
parallels in it and some

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:13.310
that we could, that we
could draw on today.

00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:15.570
And you also said you just
wanted to say that it was,

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:19.000
this is radio dammit,
as you said yesterday,

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.570
that was really the
precursor to Terry Gross's,

00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:23.700
or was Terry Gross's program.

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:25.310
And I'm sorry, you
were making a point

00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:30.430
about developmental radio
too about how many debates?

00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:31.730
[Inaudible].

00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:33.030
In Rwanda.

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:34.450
&gt;&gt; Bill Siemering: In Rwanda
a station has 40 live debates.

00:38:34.450 --> 00:38:35.750
&gt;&gt; Michele Hilmes:
40 live debate.

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:38.650
Yeah, transformative.

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:45.540
&gt;&gt; Donna Halper: Donna
Halper, Lesley University.

00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:46.840
&gt;&gt; Michele Hilmes: Oh Donna.

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:49.570
&gt;&gt; Donna Halper: If you guys
have already addressed this.

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:52.310
My apologies if you guys
have already addressed this.

00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:55.900
But could we say a couple of
words about college radio?

00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:58.920
And the reason I
wanted to say something

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:02.730
about that is I see an
incredible negativity

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:06.240
that really scares me at
a lot of college campuses.

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:09.800
It used to be that those
of us who are broadcasters,

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:13.150
whether we're doing podcasts
today or streaming audio

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:17.360
or blah, blah, blah, we all
got our start in college radio.

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:20.140
And in university
after university,

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:23.090
I'm seeing people say, well
oh kids today they don't care

00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:25.220
about radio, so we're
getting rid of our station.

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:27.200
We're selling off our assets

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:31.160
and that makes me
incredibly nervous,

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:33.010
because A -- it's our history.

00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:37.850
But B -- radio has
always done a horrible job

00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:39.700
of telling our story, okay.

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:41.430
And I say that.

00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:43.410
I'm not telling you anything
you don't already know.

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:47.660
I'm, you know, just one of, many
media historians are sitting

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:49.800
in this room and
I am one of them.

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:53.100
But it really breaks my
heart to see years and years

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:55.410
of history just dismissed

00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:58.550
like oh kids today don't
care about that anymore.

00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:03.140
And when I look at my students

00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:07.080
and I ask them whether
they use radio,

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.680
they generally say they do not.

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:11.440
And when I was a kid growing up,

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:15.120
I couldn't imagine anything
better than being a DJ,

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:17.040
than being on the air.

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:19.940
And I said on another, someone's
podcast last year, I said,

00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:23.370
you know, kids today
don't have radio dreams.

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:26.900
So, to some degree I
feel like we are trying

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:28.200
to preserve something.

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:30.160
But we're also trying
to sell something.

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.460
Does that make any sense?

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:34.660
Not sell it like money
wise, but sell our story.

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:38.450
Let people know that we still
matter, that we're still here

00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:41.250
and we're still important.

00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:45.140
&gt;&gt; Michele Hilmes: Do you
guys want to respond to that?

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:48.200
&gt;&gt; Susan Douglas: Well, I don't
have too much to say about that.

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:50.580
You know, when I went to
graduate school at Brown,

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:54.730
there was a student run
station there that was also,

00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:56.590
was a commercial station.

00:40:56.590 --> 00:41:01.110
And had a lot of
students involved in it,

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:04.550
including myself,
enormous impact.

00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:05.860
I think it's still going strong.

00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:09.510
But it was primarily, you know,
they didn't, they did news

00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:12.790
and of course a lot of music.

00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:14.560
I don't know what they're
doing now at Michigan.

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:15.860
We don't have, you know,

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:20.940
we don't have an official
college run radio station

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:22.240
in the same way.

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:24.360
We have an NPR station.

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:27.510
So, you might want to
talk about this a bit.

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:30.570
[ Inaudible ]

00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:31.870
&gt;&gt; Alexander Russo:
Yeah they did.

00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:33.170
&gt;&gt; Susan Douglas: Did they?

00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:34.470
&gt;&gt; Alexander Russo: Yeah.

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:35.770
&gt;&gt; Donna Halper: And
their assets were sold

00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:37.570
to a Christian broadcast.

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:43.070
[ Inaudible ]

00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:44.370
&gt;&gt; Susan Douglas: Oh that's sad.

00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:46.440
I mean they were, it
was a great station.

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:47.740
Yeah, yeah.

00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:49.040
&gt;&gt; Alexander Russo: Yeah

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:50.340
and actually Nate Demayo
[assumed spelling],

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:52.760
who also has a wonderful
historical podcast,

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.480
wrote a great, amazing
[inaudible] for WBRU

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:59.660
that was just was published
like a couple weeks ago.

00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:03.680
But. And, and like on one
hand, yes Donna I agree

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:06.660
that maybe students
don't have radio dreams.

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:08.850
But I do think they have
sound dreams, right?

00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:12.560
And one of the things
that, that, and, you know,

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:17.100
we can debate the essential
importance of, I don't know,

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:18.670
liveness within radio, right?

00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:21.110
Because that is something
that's, that is lost

00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:22.760
with podcasting, right?

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:27.660
But the, you know, the fact
BRU is able to continue online,

00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:30.250
right, also sort of suggests
the resilience, right,

00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:35.900
of the ways in which people are
embracing and using sound to,

00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:39.950
you know, say something
about their lives,

00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:42.030
form these different
kind of communities

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:44.830
and express themselves
in various ways.

00:42:44.830 --> 00:42:46.130
So. [Inaudible].

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:53.760
&gt;&gt; Just I want to put
in a plug for a website

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:55.140
and podcast radio survivor.

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:56.460
I know Jennifer Waits is here.

00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:57.900
I don't know if other folks are.

00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:03.360
But, about a year ago they
did an episode, maybe two,

00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:09.400
excuse me, conference
voice, no how colleges

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:11.510
and universities can
save their stations

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:15.810
and how they can start making
the case before the commercial

00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:18.660
broadcaster or the Christian
broadcaster comes in and wants

00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:20.100
to take over, you know,
buy their facilities.

00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:23.080
Because it's easy for university
presidents to see this as a pot

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:25.690
of money, you know, a gold
mine that they're sitting on.

00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:28.880
And so, how to already
begin now making the case

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:33.080
and like annual reports and
different things that colleges

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:35.890
and universities can do
proactively and preemptively

00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:38.430
to save whatever college
stations might they still have.

00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:41.970
So, talk to Jennifer Waits or
just look up Radio Survivor.

00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:43.320
And it's about a year ago.

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:44.620
Maybe Jennifer knows more.

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:45.920
But I just wanted to
throw that in there.

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:47.570
It is something that we as,

00:43:47.570 --> 00:43:50.950
those of us on college
campuses can be doing right now

00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:53.550
to save radio.

00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:55.150
&gt;&gt; Michele Hilmes: And
I would just add, as,

00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:56.700
just to take Alex's phrase,

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:59.630
they're have sound
work dreams, students.

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:03.080
I mean, can we tie, you
know, the popularity of sound

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:05.380
in general to the
radio stations?

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:08.040
Aha that's a really
good strategy.

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:11.360
&gt;&gt; Alexander Russo: Behind Bill.

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:13.020
Maybe it would help for the mic.

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:15.420
&gt;&gt; I'd like to respond
to that as well.

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:18.560
The work I'm doing is at
Indiana State University.

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:22.630
The person I am researching
built WISU.

00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:25.540
It's been in business
for over 50 years.

00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:27.580
That station started
going downhill,

00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:29.950
same problem, but in the 90's.

00:44:29.950 --> 00:44:33.980
There is a young man who took a
program management position four

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:35.380
years ago at that station.

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:36.970
His name is Rich Green.

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:39.770
And he is rebuilding
that radio program.

00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:41.820
And his students are
excited about it.

00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:43.120
So, there is hope.

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:45.420
It's not all doom and gloom.

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:49.600
&gt;&gt; Alexander Russo: I don't
know, Jess, you have the mic.

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:53.390
So that probably gives you
a certain amount of power.

00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:54.690
&gt;&gt; Bala Baptiste: Okay.

00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:55.990
Thank you.

00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:57.290
Bala Baptiste, Miles College.

00:44:57.290 --> 00:45:00.340
Will you comment on ideas

00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:04.170
that terrestrial radio
is on the decline?

00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:09.470
And on the rise is
streaming, satellite

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:13.460
and other digital platforms.

00:45:14.530 --> 00:45:19.400
&gt;&gt; Michele Hilmes: I would just
say at least we haven't shut

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:21.280
down all of our FM
stations here,

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:22.820
like they did, was it in Norway?

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:24.120
Just this last.

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:25.420
But, you're right.

00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:26.720
You know, not to
minimize it, I think.

00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:28.020
Because that brought
out all these issues

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:30.650
of well what does terrestrial
broadcasting give us

00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:32.860
that streaming can't possible?

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:34.610
And, of course, it
was immediately,

00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:35.920
I mean you can see
the significance

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:40.920
for emergency broadcasting
and also for, you know,

00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:42.880
all it would take is
for a few servers to go

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:45.710
out for the streaming
services to get interrupted

00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:47.700
and I'm sure we've
all experienced this.

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:51.020
And also that for certain kinds
of applications, like radio

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:52.320
and automobiles, I mean it's,

00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:55.080
it's vital to have
broadcast radio.

00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:58.120
You know, I keep thinking
and I'm no expert on this,

00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:00.320
so I'm just sort of wishfully
hoping that, you know,

00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:02.610
there are ways to
tie those together.

00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:04.510
So, that they remain vital.

00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:07.260
But, I don't know, I mean
do you think we're in danger

00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:09.380
of terrestrial radio
being phased

00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:11.100
out here in the United States?

00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:15.130
&gt;&gt; I think that's an aspect of
the way radio is overlooked.

00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:17.000
&gt;&gt; Michele Hilmes:
Here comes the mic.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.340
Here comes the man with the mic.

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:24.860
&gt;&gt; We'd have to look
up the details.

00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:27.510
Oh you have to turn it on?

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:32.710
[ Laughter ]

00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:35.880
You know, I can't quote the
statistics accurately right off

00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:37.180
the top of my head.

00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:39.210
But I think the idea
that terrestrial radio is

00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:42.670
in decline is part of the way
radio gets overlooked as the,

00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:45.670
some of the points Susan
Douglas was starting out with.

00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:48.550
90 some percent of
Americans listen

00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:50.750
to radio at least once a week.

00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:53.440
And most of them listen
to it every morning.

00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:58.070
And. but it's built into,
into our daily routine.

00:46:58.070 --> 00:46:59.480
We overlook it.

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:01.990
You know, we don't,
we experience it

00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:05.300
as routine, not as special.

00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:08.380
&gt;&gt; Susan Douglas: You know,
I think part of this is

00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:12.290
and I'm revealing
my own generational

00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:13.590
identification here.

00:47:13.590 --> 00:47:16.500
But, but with so much
emphasis on Millennials.

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:18.830
What are they doing?

00:47:18.830 --> 00:47:20.160
How are they driving?

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:23.730
All kinds of marketing.

00:47:23.730 --> 00:47:27.540
That can drive also this
overlooking of radio.

00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:30.400
And, you know, and
I mentioned podcasts

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.360
because that's what a lot
of them are listening to.

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:35.090
And one of the reasons
that they, that they,

00:47:35.090 --> 00:47:40.780
that some of them have, at least
in their late teenage and sort

00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:44.190
of early to mid 20
years abandoned radio is

00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:48.060
because commercial radio
ruined itself, right?

00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:54.810
I mean Clear Channel ruined
it, ruined itself, you know.

00:47:54.810 --> 00:47:56.110
[Applause].

00:47:56.110 --> 00:47:57.560
&gt;&gt; It destroyed itself.

00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:00.480
&gt;&gt; Susan Douglas: It destroyed
itself, you know, with these.

00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:01.780
[Inaudible].

00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:04.130
Yeah. I mean the music
formats are a nightmare.

00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:10.990
And so, we, we actually have
in Ann Arbor, 107.1, which is,

00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:13.420
I think it's a Serious station.

00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:19.860
No not. No, what's
the other one,

00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:21.310
not Clear Channel [Inaudible].

00:48:21.310 --> 00:48:22.610
&gt;&gt; Alexander Russo: Cumulus?

00:48:22.610 --> 00:48:25.770
&gt;&gt; Susan Douglas: It might
be a Cumulus station, yeah.

00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:30.230
And so, we have this DJ, who's
like the morning DJ and a lot

00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:32.770
of stuff comes down from
corporate, you know,

00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:34.470
that he's sort of stuck with.

00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:37.400
But, on Sunday he has his show.

00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:38.700
And he's an actual DJ.

00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:42.580
And he knows everything
about producers.

00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:46.510
And they fired him a
couple of years ago.

00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:47.810
They fired him.

00:48:47.810 --> 00:48:51.130
But the community went crazy.

00:48:51.130 --> 00:48:54.330
People were outraged.

00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:57.290
And one of the main
advertisers, a bank in town,

00:48:57.290 --> 00:48:58.970
said they were going to yank all

00:48:58.970 --> 00:49:02.790
of their advertising unless they
put that guy back on the air.

00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:07.080
And he is an example of
how radio can still thrive

00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:09.580
and really speak to an audience.

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:11.860
That is in utter
counter distinction

00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:13.990
to the clear channeling
of radio.

00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:17.350
No wonder young people don't
listen to the radio, you know.

00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:20.460
But, I'm finding
that some of them,

00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:24.580
I have quite a few
20 something friends,

00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:26.300
in part because of my daughter.

00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:31.330
They, they get out of college
and they're driving to work

00:49:31.330 --> 00:49:33.330
or they're, they start
listening to NPR.

00:49:33.330 --> 00:49:34.630
&gt;&gt; Michele Hilmes: That's true.

00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:35.930
&gt;&gt; Susan Douglas: You
know, and so, that's.

00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:39.780
And they're listening
to podcasts

00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:42.840
because they're getting
something they think is genuine.

00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:45.300
They're not getting commercials

00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:47.690
and they're not getting
Clear Channel.

00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:54.780
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Waits:
Okay, it was on.

00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:56.650
Jennifer Waits from
Radio Survivor.

00:49:56.650 --> 00:49:58.470
I'm, I haven't heard
anybody talk

00:49:58.470 --> 00:50:00.850
about low power FM
at the conference.

00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:03.410
And for me, having
visited a bunch

00:50:03.410 --> 00:50:05.100
of brand new low
power FM stations,

00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:08.880
I feel like this is an
unprecedented point in,

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:11.870
in radio history, in our
lifetime where we're getting

00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:15.420
to see so many brand new radio
stations at the same time.

00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:18.140
So, I see a lot of energy
in terrestrial radio

00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:19.440
around low power FM's.

00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:22.970
And maybe because they're
hyper local, it hasn't become

00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:24.580
as much of a national story.

00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:25.930
And maybe because
they're so new,

00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:28.120
it hasn't become an
academic story yet.

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:30.640
But within the community,
radio community,

00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:33.570
this is a huge incredible
period of time

00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:38.000
and I'm seeing young people
engaged with these new stations.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.060
And it's just a really
interesting energy

00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:42.820
and I would also agree

00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:45.590
that I think young
people often don't realize

00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:48.190
that they're actually listening
to radio when they're in the car

00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:49.490
and there's a radio on.

00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:51.240
And it's like this ambient.

00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:53.190
So people say, no I
never listen to radio,

00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:56.600
but they probably are actually
listening to radio every day.

00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:57.900
So.

00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:02.200
&gt;&gt; Susan Douglas: You know, I
do wonder, we're at, you know,

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:09.610
with the Twittering of
America and the often, the,

00:51:09.610 --> 00:51:14.710
how negative a space Twitter
can be and has become.

00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:17.440
And also some other aspects

00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:22.570
of social media have
become nasty places.

00:51:22.570 --> 00:51:26.180
Whether things like lower
power FM are going to be kind

00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:30.110
of the antidote or
the anti Twitter move

00:51:30.110 --> 00:51:33.370
to community building, because
you do have some community

00:51:33.370 --> 00:51:35.060
building on Twitter.

00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:39.100
But you also have community
annihilation on Twitter too.

00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:43.370
So, I'd actually love to
hear more about what you've,

00:51:43.370 --> 00:51:46.240
where around the country
you've found all of this.

00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:47.660
&gt;&gt; Michele Hilmes:
Just to piggyback

00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:50.540
on that really briefly, I mean
I'm sure you know this Jennifer,

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:52.170
but, you know, it's
editing the journal,

00:51:52.170 --> 00:51:54.120
we just did a special
issue on community media.

00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:55.420
And it is amazing.

00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:56.720
I mean, Bill knows this.

00:51:56.720 --> 00:52:00.300
In Africa community radio is,
you know, the, in South America,

00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:03.800
in Europe, I mean there's so
much enthusiasm and excitement

00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:05.680
and new stations
coming on all the time.

00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:08.030
And I just, you know.

00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:10.560
We got very few submissions
to that issue

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:12.050
from people in the
United States.

00:52:12.050 --> 00:52:14.270
And now, maybe the
excitement level is, we need,

00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:15.570
you know, it's not quite there.

00:52:15.570 --> 00:52:18.220
But I wish it could be.

00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:20.090
&gt;&gt; Just quickly, the University

00:52:20.090 --> 00:52:22.060
of Michigan has a
student run station, WCBN.

00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:23.360
&gt;&gt; Susan Douglas: CBN, yeah.

00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:25.380
&gt;&gt; And it's been on
the air for 50 years.

00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:28.720
It's claim to fame was
for playing It's my Party

00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:32.220
and I'll Cry if I want to
when Ronald Reagan was elected

00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:33.710
[laughter] for 24
hours in a row.

00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:35.150
It was the.

00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:38.250
24 hours. But, as part

00:52:38.250 --> 00:52:42.170
of Michigan's bicentennial
celebrations, the archives,

00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:45.600
the paper archives of the, of
the radio station were collected

00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:47.730
and deposited in the
Bentley Historical Library

00:52:47.730 --> 00:52:50.470
and a lot of, a lot of WCBN.

00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:51.770
They've moved.

00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:54.900
Connecting the dots between
college radio and podcasting,

00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:58.360
they've moved much of their,
of their work to podcast.

00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:00.840
They have a podcast server.

00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:03.300
You can look it up
as WCBN podcast.

00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:06.410
And so, what goes over the
radio then becomes podcasts

00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:09.580
and they think of
production in the, in,

00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:12.970
mentally as podcasting first.

00:53:12.970 --> 00:53:14.740
That happens to be
broadcast first

00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:17.760
and then archived
on a podcast server.

00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:19.640
So, it's alive and living.

00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:20.990
And I think that
this is the situation

00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:23.280
with a lot of college radios.

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:24.850
But, anyway.

00:53:24.850 --> 00:53:26.150
I just wanted to, I didn't.

00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:27.450
&gt;&gt; Susan Douglas: Do
they have official.

00:53:27.450 --> 00:53:28.750
Yeah, I know about BCN.

00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:32.720
But do they have official, you
know, university support and a?

00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:34.050
&gt;&gt; Yes they do, it's
based out of,

00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:37.210
it's funded by Literature,
Science and the Arts.

00:53:37.210 --> 00:53:38.510
&gt;&gt; Susan Douglas:
LS and A funds, huh?

00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:40.460
&gt;&gt; Yes. And the radio
station is in the basement

00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:43.130
of the LS and A building.

00:53:43.130 --> 00:53:44.430
&gt;&gt; Susan Douglas: Yeah.

00:53:44.430 --> 00:53:45.730
&gt;&gt; So, yeah, anyway.

00:53:45.730 --> 00:53:48.070
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to add a little
bit to the whole concept of,

00:53:48.070 --> 00:53:50.270
you know, digitization
and radio is dying.

00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:52.050
In America we're
actually pretty lucky,

00:53:52.050 --> 00:53:57.470
in that we have a shitty digital
radio system called HD radio.

00:53:57.470 --> 00:53:59.920
It is spectrally intensive.

00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:02.170
It does not provide a
qualitative improvement

00:54:02.170 --> 00:54:05.810
over analog broadcasting
and it's wholly proprietary,

00:54:05.810 --> 00:54:07.110
meaning that you actually have

00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:09.860
to pay a private
company a licensing fee

00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:11.870
to adopt the radio technology.

00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:16.490
Fortunately, the FCC back in the
early 2000's made the adoption

00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:19.620
of the digital radio
standard wholly voluntarily,

00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:22.380
wholly voluntary and
driven by the marketplace.

00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:25.270
And the marketplace has
pretty much rejected HD radio,

00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:27.020
less than 15 percent

00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:29.410
of all licensed broadcasters
have actually adopted the

00:54:29.410 --> 00:54:32.090
technology and the platform
itself has been sold

00:54:32.090 --> 00:54:34.210
from its parent company
and it's now part

00:54:34.210 --> 00:54:37.060
of a larger intellectual
property conglomerate

00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:40.840
that doesn't really care that
much about radio broadcasting.

00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:44.480
So, HD radio and the
digital transition of radio

00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:45.780
in the United States
is something

00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:48.840
that can be actively
resisted on many fronts.

00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:52.000
And I'd also kind of like to
make a plea for the analog,

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.590
since digital radio transition

00:54:53.590 --> 00:54:55.990
in the United States is
not working very well,

00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:57.740
there is something to be said

00:54:57.740 --> 00:55:01.410
for reclaiming analog
spectrum for community use.

00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:04.070
Analog radio is not trackable.

00:55:04.070 --> 00:55:07.650
It's not part of the panopticon,
like social media is.

00:55:07.650 --> 00:55:10.360
And for people that are
very involved in activism,

00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:13.030
that's a very useful
tactical tool

00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:15.720
and the FCC does not
have the authority,

00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:17.870
nor has it really had
the full authority

00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:21.870
to actually enforce the
broadcast license requirement.

00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:25.480
So, yesterday I was talking in
one of the panels about the fact

00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:27.970
that in the place where
I live, New York City,

00:55:27.970 --> 00:55:30.310
there are more unlicensed
FM radio stations

00:55:30.310 --> 00:55:33.820
on the air right now, than there
are licensed FM radio stations.

00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:37.380
So, those of you who are
interested in media activism

00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:41.060
and social movements, I would
strongly suggest that you look

00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:42.510
at radio as a mechanism

00:55:42.510 --> 00:55:45.160
for tactical organization
and communication.

00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:49.040
And it's a fairly simple risk
assessment to do and it actually

00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:53.710
in my view has been a key
component to the revitalization

00:55:53.710 --> 00:55:56.190
of radio as a community
building exercise

00:55:56.190 --> 00:55:57.660
and I think that's
going to continue

00:55:57.660 --> 00:55:59.390
for the foreseeable future.

00:55:59.390 --> 00:56:01.540
&gt;&gt; Michele Hilmes: [Inaudible].

00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:06.990
Thank you.

00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:08.530
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:56:08.530 --> 00:56:09.830
I'm Janie Doctor
[assumed spelling].

00:56:09.830 --> 00:56:12.570
I've done a lot of work
on both British radio

00:56:12.570 --> 00:56:14.260
and also American radio.

00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:16.840
And I agree with a lot
of what's been said.

00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:19.780
In teaching American
students about radio,

00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:22.650
it's very interesting when they
hear the word radio they are

00:56:22.650 --> 00:56:24.820
immediately turned off.

00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:30.180
And I find that when I start
introducing them to some

00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:32.180
of what's happening
around the world,

00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:36.400
in actually broadcast radio and
I start actually showing them

00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:40.470
that you can access that and
you can hear the creative space

00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:42.670
that radio is and
all that's going

00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:45.020
on in the really
lively discussions.

00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:48.300
And some of what's
actually starting to happen

00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:52.300
as we're talking about not
in what they think of radio,

00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:55.570
which is Clear Channel or
whatever it's called these days,

00:56:55.570 --> 00:56:59.400
but actually radio
as creative space.

00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:03.340
Then all of a sudden, they
are excited and they love it.

00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:05.180
And that's what they
think of as podcasts.

00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:08.260
So, I think part of this
is a language issue.

00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:12.630
They want to be involved
with that creative space.

00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:16.030
They don't want to be
involved with what they think

00:57:16.030 --> 00:57:19.120
of as old fashioned radio.

00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:22.780
So, I do think part of it, I
love the sound work concept,

00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:26.050
because I think, I do think
we have a language issue.

00:57:26.050 --> 00:57:27.350
I love radio.

00:57:27.350 --> 00:57:28.650
I'm from that generation.

00:57:28.650 --> 00:57:32.070
But I know that when I'm trying
to get through to my students

00:57:32.070 --> 00:57:36.110
and get them to take my courses,
I have to include Spotify,

00:57:36.110 --> 00:57:37.970
I have to include all these.

00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:39.550
I have to say, I'm talking

00:57:39.550 --> 00:57:43.150
about an expanded
definition of what radio is.

00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:45.730
Don't think of it as
what you think it is,

00:57:45.730 --> 00:57:47.870
let's talk about
what it is today.

00:57:47.870 --> 00:57:50.760
And then they, if I
bring them along with me,

00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:53.000
then all of sudden they
want to be a part of it.

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.830
And they want to help, they
want to create within it.

00:57:55.830 --> 00:57:59.070
So, I think if, if we're
going to go in the future,

00:57:59.070 --> 00:58:01.390
I do think we have to think
of the semantics of it,

00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:04.180
but I also think we have
to think of it as creative.

00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:05.480
That's what they want.

00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:07.510
They want it to be a
space that's creative.

00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:13.360
[ Inaudible ]

00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:15.180
&gt;&gt; Alexander Russo: I
think we have time for two

00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:16.480
or three more questions.

00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:17.780
&gt;&gt; I just had one,
just one comment.

00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:20.090
In the. The unique strength

00:58:20.090 --> 00:58:23.010
of broadcast radio is it's
not just bring information

00:58:23.010 --> 00:58:27.210
to people vertically, it's
the horizontal conversations

00:58:27.210 --> 00:58:29.270
that is unique to
live broadcast.

00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:30.570
&gt;&gt; Michele Hilmes: Yeah.

00:58:30.570 --> 00:58:31.870
&gt;&gt; Garrett Horton:
Garrett Horton

00:58:31.870 --> 00:58:36.710
from Concordia University,
Portland Oregon.

00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:40.680
In connection with what has
just been said, I was wondering

00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:45.020
if people, anybody in the
room can point to studies

00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:48.990
that have connected this, these
developments to mediatization,

00:58:48.990 --> 00:58:54.310
as a theoretical concept because
I've dabbled a little bit

00:58:54.310 --> 00:58:57.150
in the notion of mediatization,
the idea that, you know,

00:58:57.150 --> 00:59:00.770
our world is becoming
ever more saturated and,

00:59:00.770 --> 00:59:04.810
and defined by media and
mediatization scholars.

00:59:04.810 --> 00:59:06.740
I want to point out
that, you know,

00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:09.300
there's all these
various new developments

00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:11.500
and mediatization
is a development

00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:14.270
like globalization
like many others.

00:59:14.270 --> 00:59:19.390
And it might also help us to
maybe update and bring sort

00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:25.000
of this discussion into a,
you know, a broader context

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:29.240
that tries to define influence
of media in the current world.

00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:35.670
And mediatization might
just be a way to do that.

00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:38.930
&gt;&gt; Susan Douglas: I guess,
you know, thinking about this

00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:43.230
from a teaching point of
view, you know what so many

00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:48.980
of us are grappling with now and
seeking to revise our courses

00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:51.940
around is this very
phenomenon and the ways

00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:57.260
in which our students are
so constantly bombarded by

00:59:57.260 --> 01:00:02.040
and engaged in with
screens all the time,

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:05.570
that it's actually difficult
for them to stand back

01:00:05.570 --> 01:00:11.100
and see how much they
are in a mediatized world

01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:15.200
or whatever the correct
way to describe it is.

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:18.200
And so, I'm in the process

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:20.860
of revising our big
introductory course now.

01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:25.510
And I have to start with the,
all of the different ways

01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:30.310
in which they are engaged
with and bombarded by screens.

01:00:30.310 --> 01:00:34.920
That is very different from,
you know, when, 20 years ago.

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:39.290
And work back from that to
get them to then stand back

01:00:39.290 --> 01:00:44.590
and really see the ocean
that they're swimming in.

01:00:44.590 --> 01:00:45.890
&gt;&gt; Michele Hilmes:
So, that's it.

01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:47.190
We have to.

01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:48.490
Oh, we're getting the.

01:00:48.490 --> 01:00:50.510
Thank you all.

01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:56.340
[ Applause ]

01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:57.640
&gt;&gt; Delores Inés
Casillas: Great.

01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:59.200
Thank you to this session.

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:01.550
This is an ideal significant

01:01:01.550 --> 01:01:05.720
and very rare session
to have in general.

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:08.340
Increasingly rare
and significant

01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:11.550
because we are trying to make
a concerted effort to focus

01:01:11.550 --> 01:01:15.080
on Spanish language radio
or broadcasting in Spanish

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:18.170
or multi-lingually within
the geographical boundaries

01:01:18.170 --> 01:01:19.790
of the United States.

01:01:19.790 --> 01:01:23.620
We are definitely in solidarity
with all these other significant

01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:26.170
and important panels
taking place right now

01:01:26.170 --> 01:01:27.470
at the same time.

01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:29.440
The African American
radio panel,

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:32.210
as well as a podcasting
digital panel.

01:01:32.210 --> 01:01:36.770
Despite startling growth and
the increasing use of Spanish,

01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:40.360
there's still very little
scholarly attention, mainstream

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:44.520
or popularity attention
that's given to this medium.

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:48.460
Today, I'm very happy to
be a part of this panel

01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:50.830
with these amazing panelists.

01:01:50.830 --> 01:01:52.480
I am Delores Inés Casillas.

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:54.620
I am at the University of
California Santa Barbara.

01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:58.090
And I write on Spanish
language radio broadcasting.

01:01:58.090 --> 01:02:00.670
I've been doing that
for the past 10 years.

01:02:00.670 --> 01:02:04.400
We also have Mari Castañeda,
who's Chair of Communications

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:08.290
at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst.

01:02:08.290 --> 01:02:11.290
There is one book that, the
first book that was written

01:02:11.290 --> 01:02:15.510
on Spanish language radio
was published in 1978.

01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:18.370
The second book was
mine in 2014.

01:02:18.370 --> 01:02:20.310
But between those
two publications,

01:02:20.310 --> 01:02:24.280
Mari Castañeda published a
piece in 2003 in the Journal

01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:29.640
of Radio Audio Studies that
really revitalized this field

01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:31.410
of study for Spanish
language radio.

01:02:31.410 --> 01:02:34.500
It's considered a
[inaudible] piece in the field.

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:37.700
We also have Amalia Córdova,
who's a Latino digital curator

01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:40.670
with Smithsonian Folk Life at
Washington D.C., who is going

01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:43.490
to be talking a lot about in
Spanish indigenous bilateral

01:02:43.490 --> 01:02:47.280
broadcasting in the
U.S. And Hugo Morales,

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:48.870
who we heard yesterday

01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:53.300
at our public media
50th anniversary panel,

01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:56.410
who did not receive the kind
of introduction that I felt

01:02:56.410 --> 01:02:59.650
that he definitely merited
given his decades of work,

01:02:59.650 --> 01:03:00.950
constructing [foreign language],

01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:05.110
which is the largest bilingual
Latino public radio network

01:03:05.110 --> 01:03:07.170
in the country, known to some

01:03:07.170 --> 01:03:11.230
as a Spanish speaking
NPR of the United States.

01:03:11.230 --> 01:03:14.250
We also have Rosa
Ramón, who's a cofounder

01:03:14.250 --> 01:03:17.210
of KDMA FM in Washington.

01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:20.110
She is known as one of
the pioneering women

01:03:20.110 --> 01:03:24.340
on the Pacific Northwest
who encouraged Chicanas

01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:26.970
to be radio producers
and radio hosts.

01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:30.690
And in turn that changed
the programming we listen to

01:03:30.690 --> 01:03:33.530
and the culture of a
lot of radio stations.

01:03:33.530 --> 01:03:36.410
Monica de la Torre who's an
assistant professor transborder

01:03:36.410 --> 01:03:39.790
studies at Arizona State
University has dedicated

01:03:39.790 --> 01:03:43.930
actually her studies to
KDMA FM in Washington

01:03:43.930 --> 01:03:47.290
and has constructed a
phenomenal online archive

01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:49.390
of that radio station.

01:03:49.390 --> 01:03:52.200
We also have Magaly Rivera,
who's the Executive Director

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:56.160
of the Latino Public Radio
Consortium and right now

01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:58.320
in speaking from the
previous [inaudible]

01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:00.500
where it's speaking a
little bit about analog

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:03.960
and community activism and the
Latino Public Radio Consortium

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:07.480
is key right now in trying
to keep radio stations

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:09.370
on the air in Puerto Rico.

01:04:09.370 --> 01:04:12.150
She's key in trying to
rebuild radio stations there

01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:15.890
and as a reminder, even
though Hurricane Maria hit

01:04:15.890 --> 01:04:19.020
over a month ago, there's
still only 80 percent

01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:22.220
of the Island has electricity,
but the radio station

01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:25.570
that ran an analog was the
one that was broadcasting.

01:04:25.570 --> 01:04:28.740
And lastly, we have Joy Hayes,
who's the associate professor

01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:31.550
of Communications at
the University of Iowa,

01:04:31.550 --> 01:04:34.000
also wrote a phenomenal
book called Mexico Nation,

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.910
which was the first
book in English

01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:39.800
to really document the
significance of broadcasting

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:41.440
in Mexico as it built
its nation.

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:44.350
And she will be our
discussant today.

01:04:44.350 --> 01:04:47.390
It really is a start
studded kind of panel

01:04:47.390 --> 01:04:49.030
and it probably would've
been like the kind

01:04:49.030 --> 01:04:52.570
of panel I would have envisioned
as a dream panel 10 years ago.

01:04:52.570 --> 01:04:55.780
Before we begin, I do
want to remind people

01:04:55.780 --> 01:04:59.610
that Spanish dominant Latino's
listen the most to radio.

01:04:59.610 --> 01:05:00.910
And this is a demographic

01:05:00.910 --> 01:05:04.180
that we actually don't
pay a lot of attention to.

01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:08.260
Much more so than
English dominant listeners

01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:10.310
or African American Listeners.

01:05:10.310 --> 01:05:13.420
In fact, a listener profile
I like to remind people

01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:16.700
that the average Spanish
language radio listener earns 35

01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:18.490
thousand dollars a year.

01:05:18.490 --> 01:05:22.050
And I feel like I need to
remind an NPR crowd of that.

01:05:22.050 --> 01:05:25.790
And as someone who definitely
struts around in my NPR t-shirt

01:05:25.790 --> 01:05:28.490
as well, it's very cognizant

01:05:28.490 --> 01:05:31.070
of the very different
demographic of listeners.

01:05:31.070 --> 01:05:33.100
Listeners tune in three hours.

01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:35.830
Latino listeners tune in
three hours longer a week

01:05:35.830 --> 01:05:37.450
than the general, which was code

01:05:37.450 --> 01:05:40.090
for white English
radio listener.

01:05:40.090 --> 01:05:41.590
They listen much earlier.

01:05:41.590 --> 01:05:46.460
They tune in usually at 4 AM in
the morning, rather than 5:30

01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:49.390
or 6 AM when we hear
early morning hosts.

01:05:49.390 --> 01:05:51.560
And in my research and
elsewhere I've written

01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:55.350
about how the majority of Latino
listeners take their radio sets

01:05:55.350 --> 01:05:56.810
to work with them.

01:05:56.810 --> 01:05:59.840
And we know this when we
pass a construction site.

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:03.190
We know this when use a bathroom
at the back of a restaurant.

01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:06.590
I knew this, this morning
when the radio was coming

01:06:06.590 --> 01:06:09.490
out of my hotel housekeepers
cart

01:06:09.490 --> 01:06:11.410
when she was walking
down the hall.

01:06:11.410 --> 01:06:16.120
It is a part of our everyday
landscape in the United States,

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:18.210
whether we recognize it or not.

01:06:18.210 --> 01:06:21.200
And given the fact that it
is a working class medium,

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:23.590
I really try and advocate
that it's also a very kind

01:06:23.590 --> 01:06:25.630
of brown collar way
of listening.

01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:28.150
It's not something
that we listen

01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:31.880
in the solitary confinements
of our car when we commute.

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:35.570
And it's definitely something
that's much more a public form

01:06:35.570 --> 01:06:37.780
of listening because
of immigrants.

01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:39.240
So, with that, we are going

01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:41.510
to get started with
Mari Castañeda.

[ Applause ]

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:54.900
&gt;&gt; Mari Castañeda:
Thank you, Inés,

01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:56.200
for that wonderful
introduction of the panel

01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:57.500
and all of us here today.

01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:58.800
Thank you all for making time.

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:01.590
I want to just thank the
organizers for this gathering,

01:07:01.590 --> 01:07:04.120
especially Josh who
invited way back in the day

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:08.060
to really start thinking about
this issue a few years ago.

01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:11.170
I was helping out with sort of
the archiving that was happening

01:07:11.170 --> 01:07:15.090
in New England and particularly
Western Massachusetts.

01:07:15.090 --> 01:07:16.390
I'm only going to speak
for a few minutes,

01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:20.300
because I really do want
to recognize our panelists

01:07:20.300 --> 01:07:22.080
and the limited time
that we have here today.

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:24.750
And this in itself could
be its own conference

01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:26.050
of gathering of folks.

01:07:26.050 --> 01:07:28.550
There's many more of
us that are starting

01:07:28.550 --> 01:07:29.970
to really examine these issues

01:07:29.970 --> 01:07:32.160
and really think
about the archiving.

01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:36.430
I just wanted to highlight this
particular sort of website.

01:07:36.430 --> 01:07:39.120
It's a piece that I wrote called
New England Latino [foreign

01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:40.750
language] Through
Spanish Language Radio,

01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:42.050
the case of WFCR
[foreign language].

01:07:42.050 --> 01:07:44.830
And WFCR is actually
an NPR affiliate

01:07:44.830 --> 01:07:47.810
in Western Mass that's
located in the five colleges,

01:07:47.810 --> 01:07:51.220
which includes U-Mass Amherst,
Smith College, Hampshire,

01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:53.410
Mount Holyoke and
Hampshire College,

01:07:53.410 --> 01:07:55.330
and Amherst College as well.

01:07:55.330 --> 01:07:57.640
And one of the things
that's really important

01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.790
about this particular
program it's

01:07:59.790 --> 01:08:02.220
that it's the only
Spanish language program

01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:04.560
that started the late 70's,

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:08.170
early 80's that is still
continuously broadcast as a show

01:08:08.170 --> 01:08:10.970
in Western Massachusetts and
given what's happened with Maria

01:08:10.970 --> 01:08:15.200
in Puerto Rico and we have
a very large concentration

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:17.510
of [foreign language] in the
Western Massachusetts area.

01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:19.700
This particular program has
increasingly become very

01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:22.900
important more recently, in
terms of sharing information

01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:24.200
of what's going on in the area

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:26.680
and also the relocation
that's happening of a lot

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:29.030
of folks coming back
from the island.

01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:30.690
You know, so, in
terms of its presence,

01:08:30.690 --> 01:08:32.730
it's still a very
important program.

01:08:32.730 --> 01:08:34.030
But one of the things
that happened

01:08:34.030 --> 01:08:38.210
as we started examining
archives across Western Mass

01:08:38.210 --> 01:08:42.100
and across New England was
that the question of, you know,

01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:45.880
what archives are
worthy of preservation

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:47.520
and how are they preserved.

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:51.510
And [foreign language] the
original producer, who is here,

01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:55.700
is Luis Alfonso Melendez,
who now actually lives

01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:58.200
in Puerto Rico and was
central in the creation

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:01.110
of Radio Vieques, as well.

01:09:01.110 --> 01:09:03.370
And so, now there's a new
producer that's in charge

01:09:03.370 --> 01:09:04.670
of the [foreign language].

01:09:04.670 --> 01:09:06.140
But one of the things
that we started talking

01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:08.230
about was the fact that
he had all these archives

01:09:08.230 --> 01:09:10.910
of cassette tapes of the
program that he had done

01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:15.140
because the station itself
was not necessarily recording

01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:18.320
or preserving the programs that
were happening at the time.

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:22.310
And so, he as a radio producer
took on, upon himself to try

01:09:22.310 --> 01:09:25.060
to record as much as possible
some of the cassette tapes,

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:26.360
I mean some of the programs

01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:27.660
that were happening
through cassettes.

01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:32.110
And so, he has these boxes and
boxes and boxes of programs

01:09:32.110 --> 01:09:34.290
that actually included
conversations, for instance,

01:09:34.290 --> 01:09:37.540
about freeing Oscar
Lopez that, you know,

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:40.070
he was recently freed
over the summer.

01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:42.910
And the importance of those
conversations and mobilization

01:09:42.910 --> 01:09:45.820
that was happening
even back in the 90's.

01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:48.270
And. But one of the
challenges that we found was

01:09:48.270 --> 01:09:51.210
that even though
universities, including U-Mass,

01:09:51.210 --> 01:09:54.190
were interested in the archive,
you know, one of the things

01:09:54.190 --> 01:09:55.490
that they made very clear was

01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:57.270
that you can't just give us
a box and then we're going

01:09:57.270 --> 01:10:00.840
to put it away in a sort
of room and that's it.

01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:03.710
That there's, the archival work
really does require someone

01:10:03.710 --> 01:10:06.860
that has to go in and really
listen to the program,

01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:09.530
take notes, really examine
what's going on with it?

01:10:09.530 --> 01:10:12.540
What are the various different
sort of themes and topics

01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:14.570
and the conditions
of the cassettes

01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:17.290
and the various different pieces

01:10:17.290 --> 01:10:19.220
of the programming
that were recorded?

01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:20.530
And so, it's been
a big challenge

01:10:20.530 --> 01:10:24.330
because of the limited resources
that some of the libraries have.

01:10:24.330 --> 01:10:27.120
The limited, you know, the fact
that there's very limited folks

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:30.280
in that region that speak
fluently in Spanish,

01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:34.840
in terms of being able to really
transcribe what is happening

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:36.620
with regards to those programs.

01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:38.800
And so, one of the things that
I have been trying to do is work

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:41.670
with some of my students that
are fluent Spanish speakers

01:10:41.670 --> 01:10:45.090
as part of a course, community
engagement course to try

01:10:45.090 --> 01:10:48.390
to really document that
particular archive to make sure

01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:51.850
that the conversations that
really have shaped a lot

01:10:51.850 --> 01:10:56.160
of New England and particularly
Western New England [foreign

01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:57.580
language] and conversations
about the fact

01:10:57.580 --> 01:10:59.930
that there's a large Puerto
Rican community that's been

01:10:59.930 --> 01:11:01.230
there since the 40's

01:11:01.230 --> 01:11:06.550
and increasingly also [foreign
language] that are relocating

01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:08.720
to the region because
of agriculture

01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:12.220
and particularly
the tobacco fields.

01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:14.640
That again, [foreign
language] has been historically

01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:15.940
very important.

01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:17.240
Here we go.

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:21.270
Has been historically been
very important in helping sort

01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:23.870
of think about the
community itself

01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:25.240
and so I just wanted
to put it up there.

01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:29.210
So, I just want to just note
this because there's a lot

01:11:29.210 --> 01:11:32.550
of work that still needs to be
done and I think the question

01:11:32.550 --> 01:11:35.200
of again, whose archives
are worth preserving?

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:36.500
And how are they preserved?

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:39.370
And what kind of resources
are being put in there?

01:11:39.370 --> 01:11:41.880
became very clear in the
process of both looking

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:44.170
at [foreign language] and
various different archives

01:11:44.170 --> 01:11:47.340
in Western Mass, specifically
serving communities of color

01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:49.740
that have been ignored,
that have not been taken

01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:53.960
into account, that don't
have the resources to be able

01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:55.470
to really sort of
preserve them in the way

01:11:55.470 --> 01:11:57.010
that they deserve
to be preserved.

01:11:57.010 --> 01:12:00.620
And in fact, one of the things
that came up in the course

01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:03.010
of trying to think
about what was happening

01:12:03.010 --> 01:12:05.770
with this particular
archive and others,

01:12:05.770 --> 01:12:08.910
is that we were literally
sometimes, oftentimes confronted

01:12:08.910 --> 01:12:10.660
with folks just saying,
you know,

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:12.460
is this really that important?

01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:14.740
You know, is it worth
the resources to pour

01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:17.210
into this particular
type of archive?

01:12:17.210 --> 01:12:19.300
It's going to, you know,
it's going to cost hundreds

01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:20.940
of thousands of dollars perhaps,

01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:24.140
definitely lots of
hours of labor.

01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:26.770
And is it something that
is worth preserving.

01:12:26.770 --> 01:12:29.410
And, of course, our
argument was yes, absolutely.

01:12:29.410 --> 01:12:32.300
A lot of the programming that
was happening particularly

01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:34.510
in [foreign language] is
really documenting the history

01:12:34.510 --> 01:12:36.670
of Latinos in Western
Massachusetts

01:12:36.670 --> 01:12:38.190
and in the New England area

01:12:38.190 --> 01:12:40.670
because they were not just
focusing on Western Mass,

01:12:40.670 --> 01:12:44.290
but also about the migration
of folks to the Northeast

01:12:44.290 --> 01:12:46.780
and so really had both
regional, national

01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:48.610
and transnational conversations

01:12:48.610 --> 01:12:52.960
because sometimes Luis was also
actually phoning in with folks

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:56.060
in Puerto Rico and Mexico and
different parts of Latin America

01:12:56.060 --> 01:12:58.170
about what was happening
in those areas and how

01:12:58.170 --> 01:13:01.310
that was impacting U.S. Latinos
as well because, of course,

01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:03.070
the connections that
were happening

01:13:03.070 --> 01:13:06.240
between communities are not as
sort of separate as sometimes,

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:08.480
oftentimes people
assume them to be.

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:12.260
And so, really trying to
think about, you know, again,

01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:15.740
whose archives are we
really emphasizing.

01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:18.720
I'm struck that oftentimes
we're not really thinking

01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:22.570
about communities of color and
the archives that do exist,

01:13:22.570 --> 01:13:25.640
but what kind of resources do
we have to make those available

01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:28.330
to other people because of
the rich cultural history

01:13:28.330 --> 01:13:31.810
that actually does exist in
these, in these programs.

01:13:31.810 --> 01:13:33.960
And so, this is one of the
projects that I am working

01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:36.200
on trying to really
document that.

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:39.180
But there's a lot of work to
do and a lot of other projects

01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:40.480
and I know that a
lot of my friends

01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:42.410
and colleagues here
are engaged with that.

01:13:42.410 --> 01:13:45.760
But I really want us to think
a little bit more deeply

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:48.860
about how do we actually
make that effort

01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:51.570
to really include those
archives in these conversations.

01:13:51.570 --> 01:13:53.620
For instance, this program
should be part of the Library

01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:56.550
of Congress, should be
documented and preserved.

01:13:56.550 --> 01:13:58.750
And why is it not happening?

01:13:58.750 --> 01:14:00.860
How do we make that
happen is the thing I want

01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:02.160
to conclude with.

01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:03.960

01:14:39.170 --> 01:14:40.470
Okay [inaudible].

01:14:40.470 --> 01:14:42.290
Okay great.

01:14:42.290 --> 01:14:43.590
[Foreign language].

01:14:43.590 --> 01:14:44.890
Good morning.

01:14:44.890 --> 01:14:46.860
I like starting multi-lingually
because my life is that way.

01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:49.120
And I want to thank
the conference

01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:50.500
for putting this together.

01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:53.860
I also want to acknowledge
the Pescado Nation

01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:58.900
on whose land we're
gathered today.

01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:02.370
I wanted to talk
about other languages

01:15:02.370 --> 01:15:07.420
in the [foreign language]
and I thought I would start

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:11.130
with an event that
happened as a side event

01:15:11.130 --> 01:15:13.130
of the U.N. Permanent
Forum on Indigenous Issues,

01:15:13.130 --> 01:15:14.430
which is held every year.

01:15:14.430 --> 01:15:18.710
And in 2015 in the
spring, a student of NYU

01:15:18.710 --> 01:15:22.120
of Quechua Language Program
organized the transnational

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:25.510
voices panel of indigenous
radio broadcasters.

01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:28.660
Three of them were broadcasting
in the New York City area.

01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:30.530
One of them, [foreign
language] was visiting.

01:15:30.530 --> 01:15:34.450
She's a very famous well known
[family history] broadcaster.

01:15:34.450 --> 01:15:36.680
So, it was an occasion to
actually have a conversation

01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:38.640
around the different
languages that are spoken

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:41.580
in the Northeast again and
specifically in New York City,

01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:43.210
which happens to be the city

01:15:43.210 --> 01:15:44.920
with the largest
indigenous population

01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:48.180
of all the United States if
you combine indigenous people

01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:49.480
from all over the world,

01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:52.210
not just the continental
United States.

01:15:52.210 --> 01:15:56.460
So, [foreign language] who runs
First Voices Indigenous Radio,

01:15:56.460 --> 01:15:59.440
which is the stable indigenous
North American radio show

01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:02.290
in New York City on
Pacifica Network,

01:16:02.290 --> 01:16:04.470
gave introductory remarks
working with [foreign language],

01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:06.430
who used to work with the WBAI,

01:16:06.430 --> 01:16:09.540
which is another
Pacifica affiliate,

01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:11.850
and the morning program.

01:16:11.850 --> 01:16:13.820
And [foreign language]
who is Quechua

01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:16.380
and who is a radio
broadcaster who was working

01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:19.280
on Spanish language radio,
but then he met Charlie

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:21.800
and he met other people
who were working in Quechua

01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:25.710
and they decided to put together
a Quechua language radio show

01:16:25.710 --> 01:16:29.010
in New York, a weekly
online broadcast program.

01:16:29.010 --> 01:16:33.100
And the two other broadcasters
are [foreign language]

01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:38.610
from Mexico.

01:16:38.610 --> 01:16:42.570
So, how does Quechua become,

01:16:42.570 --> 01:16:45.590
start to scan across
New York City.

01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:48.670
There's a Quechua program
funded by [inaudible] funding

01:16:48.670 --> 01:16:51.560
of the Department of Education
under the Foreign Language

01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:53.550
and area studies funding.

01:16:53.550 --> 01:16:54.850
And so, the students

01:16:54.850 --> 01:16:59.530
of the Quechua program are
learning Quechua as part

01:16:59.530 --> 01:17:02.190
of their foundational
academic training.

01:17:02.190 --> 01:17:04.260
But they know there's
a community out there

01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:06.150
and so increasingly
the program is not just

01:17:06.150 --> 01:17:09.520
about having a language
lessons on the campus,

01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:12.670
but getting language speakers
from across the tri state area

01:17:12.670 --> 01:17:15.730
to come in and hear different
variants and really think

01:17:15.730 --> 01:17:18.000
of Quechua as a living language
and as a language that's

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.890
around you, not somewhere
in a remote place.

01:17:20.890 --> 01:17:24.070
So, there are weekly workshops
open to the community.

01:17:24.070 --> 01:17:26.360
There are podcasts being
created by the students

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:28.570
so they can listen and hear
and practice their Quechua.

01:17:28.570 --> 01:17:30.220
And there are community
gatherings.

01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:31.520
So, we already have this kind

01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:33.590
of soundscape happening
around us at NYU.

01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:35.930
And I was at that time the
assistant director of the Center

01:17:35.930 --> 01:17:38.850
for Latin American
Studies at NYU.

01:17:38.850 --> 01:17:42.610
And so, these three
Quechua speakers,

01:17:42.610 --> 01:17:47.260
because Charlie [inaudible] is
a second generation Ecuadorian,

01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:49.840
and his parents were
not really investing

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:51.140
in him learning Quechua.

01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:53.120
That was seen as
something to leave behind.

01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:55.800
And when he said, I want to
study Quechua and I'm going

01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:57.270
to learn Quechua at NYU,

01:17:57.270 --> 01:17:59.600
he was like why are you using
your credits this way, right?

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:02.640
So, it's, it's a
whole sort of work

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:04.310
to legitimize the
language again,

01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:08.360
as again a contemporary language
and a language that's around us.

01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:14.350
So, the radio show was
a wonderful way for them

01:18:14.350 --> 01:18:16.520
to get together [foreign
language] got together.

01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:18.600
And [foreign language] had
already this wonderful radio

01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:23.310
experience, built the studio
that you see now in a basement

01:18:23.310 --> 01:18:24.610
of a building in the Bronx.

01:18:24.610 --> 01:18:28.890
And this is how Kichwa Hatari
begins, by just doing it

01:18:28.890 --> 01:18:30.310
and bringing the
community together.

01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:34.070
And they broadcast in Spanish
and Quechua, sometimes in Kichwa

01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:35.380
and sometimes in
English depending

01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:37.470
on who their guests are.

01:18:37.470 --> 01:18:40.530
So, as a programming of the
Folklife Festival last year,

01:18:40.530 --> 01:18:43.410
we really wanted to bring
these kind of initiatives

01:18:43.410 --> 01:18:46.140
and this kind of
work to them all.

01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:48.380
So, we built a little
station called,

01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:52.580
during our program
called On the Move.

01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:54.970
We were talking about migration
in the United States as part

01:18:54.970 --> 01:18:56.740
of a 50th anniversary.

01:18:56.740 --> 01:19:00.450
We had a media production
setup, really, really barebones.

01:19:00.450 --> 01:19:02.530
I don't know if you've been to
the festival, but we have it

01:19:02.530 --> 01:19:04.290
on the mall and then
take it down.

01:19:04.290 --> 01:19:05.860
So, there are no hard walls.

01:19:05.860 --> 01:19:09.820
It's all just tarp
and two by fours.

01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:13.420
So, we build this media
studio on the mall.

01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:14.990
And we invited Kichwa Hatari

01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:17.230
to be our resident
media collective.

01:19:17.230 --> 01:19:19.900
So, they basically, when
we were planning this,

01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:21.430
I was thinking how are
you going to do this

01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:23.580
and when they told me the
activities they were thinking,

01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:26.310
I was like you're
basically bringing the studio

01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:27.760
onto the mall, right?

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:30.540
So, that's what they did.

01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:33.660
So, this was them intervening
this blackboard that we put.

01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:35.830
They brought the [foreign
language], the flag.

01:19:35.830 --> 01:19:38.620
And, of course, we
also had other programs

01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:41.210
with the local Andean
community, which is huge here

01:19:41.210 --> 01:19:43.820
around the D.C. Virginia area.

01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:46.960
So, thinking about the people I
was bringing, I was very excited

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:48.260
to think that there
would be all these,

01:19:48.260 --> 01:19:50.080
all these cross references.

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:51.380
So, Kichwa Hatari ends

01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:53.350
up interviewing the
[foreign language] team

01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:55.390
or the dance troupe
that we brought

01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:58.110
of different Bolivian
[inaudible] dancers.

01:19:58.110 --> 01:20:00.280
And in Quechua, in
Kichwa, right,

01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:03.620
depending on who they were
bringing, mostly Quechua,

01:20:03.620 --> 01:20:06.070
interviewing a local
DJ who's Bolivian,

01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:08.190
whose grandfather spoke Quechua.

01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:10.340
And just producing these
new relationships and they

01:20:10.340 --> 01:20:13.240
like this idea of the
popup so much that.

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:14.540
We called it the mixing room.

01:20:14.540 --> 01:20:16.630
That's what this little
space that you see behind.

01:20:16.630 --> 01:20:17.930
We call that the mixing room.

01:20:17.930 --> 01:20:20.740
And it was an open air studio
and they like this idea so much

01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:23.180
that they're now doing this
in other festivals and events.

01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:27.160
This was kind of the first
time they took the studio out.

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:31.510
So, they have a page on the
Smithsonian Folklife website.

01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:33.030
You can go visit it and
learn a little bit more

01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:34.970
about their work.

01:20:34.970 --> 01:20:39.150
Another thing they did
was offer Quechua class.

01:20:39.150 --> 01:20:41.470
On the, in the bottom row

01:20:41.470 --> 01:20:45.350
in the middle you see five
[foreign language] doing an open

01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:48.380
air Quechua, Kichwa
class for the public.

01:20:48.380 --> 01:20:50.900
And we were able to get
this out and people came.

01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:52.200
They actually got an audience.

01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:54.730
We were having interviews
of the participants come

01:20:54.730 --> 01:20:56.500
through this open air studio.

01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:58.150
We have students come through.

01:20:58.150 --> 01:21:00.580
And at the end of the day,
they would just get together

01:21:00.580 --> 01:21:03.710
and do some music right there
on the mall after hours.

01:21:03.710 --> 01:21:05.940
So, they really took over the
space and this is just a way

01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:09.410
to show how, how you can bring
the liveness of radio out

01:21:09.410 --> 01:21:12.430
and into the air and consider
it in your programming.

01:21:12.430 --> 01:21:13.730
That it's not just
something that has

01:21:13.730 --> 01:21:15.630
to stay in a digital medium.

01:21:15.630 --> 01:21:17.900
You can show people the
value of this engagement

01:21:17.900 --> 01:21:20.340
and they really did a great
job by bringing things

01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:21.640
like the [foreign
language], the Andean flag.

01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:25.020
Things like brining the Quechua,
the Kichwa class methodology,

01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:28.760
by bringing the music,
by DJing on site.

01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:31.970
So, they really spilled over
their kind of usual format

01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:34.060
of two hour broadcast on Friday.

01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:38.400
And this is, this is
something that really was easy

01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:43.270
to incorporate into our thinking
around a live presentation

01:21:43.270 --> 01:21:46.750
on the mall open air
public presentation.

01:21:46.750 --> 01:21:51.270
So, they broadcast [foreign
language] every Friday six

01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:52.570
to eight.

01:21:52.570 --> 01:21:55.320
The episodes are archived on
the Kichwa Hatari website.

01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:57.840
It's in Spanish and in Quechua.

01:21:57.840 --> 01:21:59.620
Little pieces are
in English too.

01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:00.940
They have a Facebook page,

01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:02.540
where they're regularly
posting the events

01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:05.900
that they are starting to
travel in different places.

01:22:05.900 --> 01:22:08.470
So, they've been to Havana
to the [foreign language]

01:22:08.470 --> 01:22:11.250
to a conference there on radio.

01:22:11.250 --> 01:22:12.550
They're really getting
attention.

01:22:12.550 --> 01:22:14.210
And they have a Twitter
handle Kichwa Hatari.

01:22:14.210 --> 01:22:16.430
So, I just wanted to
bring up the importance

01:22:16.430 --> 01:22:18.990
of thinking outside of
just Spanish language.

01:22:18.990 --> 01:22:22.640
Spanish is a bridge to
other constituencies.

01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:25.120
And I think what they're
also, what Kichwa Hatari

01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:28.850
and other collectives are
doing is creating this diasp,

01:22:28.850 --> 01:22:31.330
we're bringing together this
[inaudible] of people who,

01:22:31.330 --> 01:22:32.770
because of the jobs
and the migration

01:22:32.770 --> 01:22:34.740
and sometimes documentation
status

01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:38.430
and just geographic remoteness,
they'll come together

01:22:38.430 --> 01:22:40.640
and through the radio, they're
bringing together this language

01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:43.440
community, which ends up
being a cultural community.

01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:45.110
So, that's how important
this is.

01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:49.720
And also people are using the
radio program as an entry point

01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:51.230
into language revitalization.

01:22:51.230 --> 01:22:54.010
So, by listening and hearing
Quechua and Kichwa bilingually,

01:22:54.010 --> 01:22:57.490
broadcast bilingually, people
have started to also realize

01:22:57.490 --> 01:22:59.670
that they understand or be
interested and say I want

01:22:59.670 --> 01:23:02.470
to speak better, I want
to gain fluency, right.

01:23:02.470 --> 01:23:05.160
So, this is part of the project.

01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:07.100
Their website really
explains their mission well.

01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:08.940
They talk about Andean
world view.

01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:10.240
They talk about the language.

01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:12.090
But they also talk about
the living community.

01:23:12.090 --> 01:23:14.340
And I'll be happy to
take questions later.

01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:16.140
Thank you.

01:23:16.140 --> 01:23:44.510
[ Applause ]

01:23:44.510 --> 01:23:53.040
[ Inaudible ]

01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:54.340
&gt;&gt; Hugo Morales: Buenos Diaz.

01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:55.640
Good morning.

01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:57.890
So, Hugo Morales, I'm
Hugo Morales and I want

01:23:57.890 --> 01:24:01.240
to tell you a little bit about
the history of Radio Bilingue

01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:04.380
and then proceed to give
you a little bit of an idea

01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:08.020
about what it is already
archived here at the Library

01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:10.150
of Congress of Radio Bilingue.

01:24:10.150 --> 01:24:12.590
So, I'm Hugo Morales.

01:24:12.590 --> 01:24:14.800
I'm co-founder of
Radio Bilingue.

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:16.930
Thank you, Ines,
for inviting me.

01:24:16.930 --> 01:24:22.870
And I'm looking forward
to Rosa Ramón's story.

01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:26.300
She's been a real force
in public broadcast,

01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:28.500
particularly community radio.

01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:33.340
So, you know, Radio Bilingue
was founded in 1976 and we went

01:24:33.340 --> 01:24:36.570
on the air on July 4th, 1980.

01:24:36.570 --> 01:24:39.480
And we chose July 4th,
1980 because we wanted

01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:43.440
to affirm the fact that
we're U.S. citizens,

01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:46.300
the fact that we too
should have a space

01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:48.910
in the airwaves of this country.

01:24:48.910 --> 01:24:50.220
We wanted to be recognized.

01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:51.850
We also wanted to express

01:24:51.850 --> 01:24:56.400
and exercise our First
Amendment rights.

01:24:56.400 --> 01:25:03.460
That's why founded Radio
Bilingue and we chose July 4th.

01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:07.690
And so, it's, it's really
important to note that date,

01:25:07.690 --> 01:25:10.290
at least for me, a cofounder,

01:25:10.290 --> 01:25:12.320
that when we founded
Radio Bilingue there were

01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:16.610
about 15 million
Latinos in the U.S.,

01:25:16.610 --> 01:25:21.310
which is about 6.5 percent
share of the U.S. population.

01:25:21.310 --> 01:25:27.910
And we're now at 58 million
in the U.S. and 18 percent

01:25:27.910 --> 01:25:29.860
of the general population.

01:25:29.860 --> 01:25:32.530
According to the [inaudible]
Trust just this week,

01:25:32.530 --> 01:25:37.370
they put out 72 percent of us
Latinos speak Spanish at home.

01:25:37.370 --> 01:25:38.780
So, I think the importance

01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:43.800
of a Spanish language media
is not something that is like,

01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:45.800
it shouldn't be anyway,
on the back burner,

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:48.860
but rather something that
folks should pay attention to.

01:25:48.860 --> 01:25:50.160
It's a lot of folks.

01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:53.690
And in California, essentially,

01:25:53.690 --> 01:25:56.060
I don't think you can get
anything past the California

01:25:56.060 --> 01:26:00.630
Legislature now without
the pen of a Latino,

01:26:00.630 --> 01:26:04.760
because we control the Senate
and we control the Assembly.

01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:06.960
So, nothing goes through.

01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:09.280
So, that's, that's
where we've come.

01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:14.270
But I want to talk about Radio
Bilingue has played a part today

01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:18.520
in, you know, it's played
a part in the development

01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:21.180
and history particularly
of California,

01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:23.960
but, but just in general.

01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:28.700
We have the same values as
the public broadcasters.

01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:31.790
We are part of the public
broadcasting family.

01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:35.730
We believe in the integrity
of, of what we put on the air.

01:26:35.730 --> 01:26:39.360
We don't accept money
from tobacco companies

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:42.950
or liquor companies,
or anybody who's

01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:45.290
in the AFL-CIO boycott list.

01:26:45.290 --> 01:26:49.330
We understand that our
community is vulnerable.

01:26:49.330 --> 01:26:54.430
Our, you know, the, our
core audience earns less

01:26:54.430 --> 01:26:56.340
than 35 thousand a year.

01:26:56.340 --> 01:27:00.230
Our core audience probably has

01:27:00.230 --> 01:27:04.030
like a high school
education or less.

01:27:04.030 --> 01:27:08.890
So, you know, we, that's
why we have these policies

01:27:08.890 --> 01:27:10.190
and we also don't play
[foreign language]

01:27:10.190 --> 01:27:13.300
and we don't promote
drugs or violence.

01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:18.080
And that includes
violence against women.

01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:23.220
So, and we also don't,
don't allow any of our songs

01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:27.330
to be played that in any
way degrade, you know,

01:27:27.330 --> 01:27:32.510
gays and lesbians and so
on, which is very common

01:27:32.510 --> 01:27:35.920
in commercial Spanish
language media.

01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:41.340
And so, what we do in public
affairs and we the founders

01:27:41.340 --> 01:27:46.810
from the beginning thought
the heart of our and sole

01:27:46.810 --> 01:27:48.740
of our [foreign language] or
obviously [foreign language]

01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:52.960
and so we are not
Spanish speaking only.

01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:54.260
We're bilingual.

01:27:54.260 --> 01:27:55.860
So that's why it's
Radio Bilingue.

01:27:55.860 --> 01:27:58.190
And to be correct,
actually, now it should be

01:27:58.190 --> 01:28:00.740
like Radio Multilingue,
I mean because we are

01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:05.220
in fact also broadcasting
indigenous languages

01:28:05.220 --> 01:28:09.860
like [foreign language], which
is the language of my people.

01:28:09.860 --> 01:28:11.430
I'm a [foreign language]
immigrant.

01:28:11.430 --> 01:28:16.110
And also, we also broadcast
in [foreign language]

01:28:16.110 --> 01:28:21.750
in our full power FM
station in Salinas.

01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:24.330
And so, that, that
station broadcast

01:28:24.330 --> 01:28:25.870
to the [foreign language]
population because it too

01:28:25.870 --> 01:28:28.700
within the context of
indigenous in Mexico

01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:31.530
or the Americas is among
the most vulnerable.

01:28:31.530 --> 01:28:35.470
There's only about 40 or 50
thousand [foreign language]

01:28:35.470 --> 01:28:40.310
and about five thousand
are in, within our,

01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:43.310
within a service
area in Salinas.

01:28:43.310 --> 01:28:45.280
And then, in terms of,
[foreign language],

01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:50.350
there's about three million of
us and of course our homeland is

01:28:50.350 --> 01:28:54.020
in the Northern part of the
state of [foreign language],

01:28:54.020 --> 01:28:56.330
Southern part of
[foreign language].

01:28:56.330 --> 01:28:59.120
But, anyway, in one
of our beats,

01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:03.490
our beats include [inaudible],
which is typical of,

01:29:03.490 --> 01:29:07.450
if you take out any,
how will I say, yeah,

01:29:07.450 --> 01:29:11.010
surveys of what Latinos
are interested in.

01:29:11.010 --> 01:29:12.310
We cover those.

01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:14.150
You hear about education.

01:29:14.150 --> 01:29:16.700
You hear about economic
opportunity.

01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:18.800
You hear about immigration.

01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:21.000
You talk about health access.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.350
So, we cover those beats.

01:29:22.350 --> 01:29:25.210
And, of course, we also cover
the arts and literature.

01:29:25.210 --> 01:29:27.830
And so, if you look
at immigration

01:29:27.830 --> 01:29:32.480
that has been something that
we have followed very closely

01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:34.100
for a lot of reasons, including

01:29:34.100 --> 01:29:39.220
that literally it's a
life changing situation

01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:41.250
for many of our families.

01:29:41.250 --> 01:29:46.140
Just in Fresno, the City
of Fresno and also LA,

01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:50.020
one out of five children
in LA Unified

01:29:50.020 --> 01:29:54.300
or Fresno Unified has one
or two undocumented parents.

01:29:54.300 --> 01:29:57.250
I mean, that's, you know,
that gives you a sense

01:29:57.250 --> 01:30:03.160
of the dimension of why right
now, for example, there's a lot

01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:05.950
of fear among the
Latino community.

01:30:05.950 --> 01:30:08.840
And that includes our audience.

01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:13.190
So, if you look at, looking back
at Radio Bilingue's history,

01:30:13.190 --> 01:30:17.370
we were there when we covered
the immigration debates,

01:30:17.370 --> 01:30:19.090
you know, in the mid 80's,

01:30:19.090 --> 01:30:21.300
leading to the Simpson-Rodino
Bill,

01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:25.890
which equalized some
three million folks,

01:30:25.890 --> 01:30:30.970
and which opened doors to
economic opportunities,

01:30:30.970 --> 01:30:32.920
etcetera, etcetera and
coming out of the shadows.

01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:36.760
So, Radio Bilingue provides
a daily forum, live forum.

01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:39.720
We have a talk show called
[foreign language] that began

01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:45.960
in 1995, which it literally,
it was modeled after Talk

01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:49.270
of the Nation, that was part
of National Public Radio.

01:30:49.270 --> 01:30:52.060
I think that was abandoned
like three or four years ago.

01:30:52.060 --> 01:30:54.740
But, so, you get
a sense of that.

01:30:54.740 --> 01:30:58.080
But, talk in Spanish,
particularly for our families,

01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:00.620
is really, really critical.

01:31:00.620 --> 01:31:04.560
It's something that, you
know, it's a way for people

01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:07.560
to communicate, to
learn, etcetera.

01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:14.530
And so, we also covered in
the 90's the backlash in some

01:31:14.530 --> 01:31:17.850
of the places like in the
Midwest against the migration

01:31:17.850 --> 01:31:21.830
of Mexicans and Latinos moving
into particularly the midwest.

01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:25.220
So, we cover that and of course,
it's not just the Midwest.

01:31:25.220 --> 01:31:31.890
California, Pete Wilson, and,
you know, and his, you know,

01:31:31.890 --> 01:31:35.430
folks like him who pushed
for literally a proposal

01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:38.610
and the proposal went
beyond that, a proposition

01:31:38.610 --> 01:31:43.290
that effectively, you know,
got rid of, proposed to get rid

01:31:43.290 --> 01:31:45.480
of services for the
undocumented.

01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:47.520
Eventually, it lost
in the courts.

01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:48.820
But that happened.

01:31:48.820 --> 01:31:50.120
I guess that's a
representation of that.

01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:53.330
And then, also the [inaudible]
of bilingual education

01:31:53.330 --> 01:31:58.790
in our schools, that
passed and became law.

01:31:58.790 --> 01:32:06.270
And we had no luck in getting
it overturned, until this year.

01:32:06.270 --> 01:32:08.250
So, anyway, but that's something

01:32:08.250 --> 01:32:11.920
that we covered [inaudible]
the hostility.

01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:16.780
And now, of course, that we're
covering many triumphs of our,

01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:19.910
within our legislature in
the State of California

01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:22.820
that are very pro-Latino
and pro-immigrant.

01:32:22.820 --> 01:32:26.850
We're a sanctuary
state, you know, where,

01:32:26.850 --> 01:32:29.690
you know other cities
may struggle,

01:32:29.690 --> 01:32:32.770
our entire state is a sanctuary.

01:32:32.770 --> 01:32:37.190
So, those are some of the
things that we've covered.

01:32:37.190 --> 01:32:40.560
And there's a degree of
identification and comfort.

01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:45.120
But those that are understand
the mission of Radio Bilingue

01:32:45.120 --> 01:32:46.870
and how important
Radio Bilingue is.

01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:51.580
So, when Rosa Maria
Hernandez, an indigenous woman

01:32:51.580 --> 01:32:54.860
from the State of Oaxaca,
where I'm from, you know,

01:32:54.860 --> 01:32:57.820
when her child was
taken away at the birth

01:32:57.820 --> 01:33:01.860
because she could not
speak Spanish or English

01:33:01.860 --> 01:33:06.940
and therefore was considered
by the courts to not be fit

01:33:06.940 --> 01:33:09.820
to be a mother and
mother her child.

01:33:09.820 --> 01:33:13.640
We. It was an activist person
from the State of [inaudible]

01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:16.280
who called Radio
Bilingue and asked

01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:18.490
that we put that story out.

01:33:18.490 --> 01:33:21.770
And we did and it became a
national mainstream story

01:33:21.770 --> 01:33:23.100
including the New York Times

01:33:23.100 --> 01:33:24.680
and eventually she
would recover child.

01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:26.110
But that's, that's the.

01:33:26.110 --> 01:33:29.490
By the way, we also get calls
like that from occasionally

01:33:29.490 --> 01:33:32.690
from people who are cut
up, how would I say it?

01:33:32.690 --> 01:33:38.130
Victims of the Narcos in Mexico.

01:33:38.130 --> 01:33:39.830
That's something that also.

01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:44.620
So, we're not just a recognized
as a Latino U.S. service,

01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:45.920
but a transnational service.

01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:47.430
In fact, we broadcast
in [foreign language]

01:33:47.430 --> 01:33:52.550
and we have been since about
2000 by satellite all the way

01:33:52.550 --> 01:33:53.850
to Oaxaca, our homeland.

01:33:53.850 --> 01:33:58.600
On Sundays we take over
the airwaves in that way.

01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:02.240
What I want to do is
also tell you like,

01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:08.910
like what's in the archives
because already we do have some

01:34:08.910 --> 01:34:13.540
of our, much of our content
on the archives at the Library

01:34:13.540 --> 01:34:15.640
of Congress, who could use
some more help by the way

01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:18.870
of some grad students
to finish the job.

01:34:18.870 --> 01:34:22.390
But among the what's
in the archives now

01:34:22.390 --> 01:34:25.600
and you can visit the
Library of Congress archives,

01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:27.960
are the first day
broadcast of Radio Bilingue.

01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:30.490
And it's interesting
how that came about.

01:34:30.490 --> 01:34:33.960
Actually, we didn't
care about taping it.

01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:35.980
It's interesting, right?

01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:38.430
It was actually one
of our supporters,

01:34:38.430 --> 01:34:39.770
who I didn't even know,

01:34:39.770 --> 01:34:43.900
who he was actually the second
attorney, Mexican attorney,

01:34:43.900 --> 01:34:47.380
Mexican American attorney in
the whole San Joaquin Valley,

01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:52.200
whole central value, who got
his tape recorder and taped it.

01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:55.700
And about two years
ago, before his death,

01:34:55.700 --> 01:34:57.290
gave it to Radio Bilingue.

01:34:57.290 --> 01:34:58.800
And that's how it's saved.

01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:01.980
So, and then for the first
10 years, we actually used,

01:35:01.980 --> 01:35:03.500
because of the economic
situation,

01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:08.670
we literally had a bulking
machine where we erased programs

01:35:08.670 --> 01:35:11.630
on tape because of
economic reasons.

01:35:11.630 --> 01:35:13.630
We didn't think about
preserving.

01:35:13.630 --> 01:35:15.960
But obviously, now
we know the value.

01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:22.200
And now, we're literally taping
every second of our broadcast.

01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:27.090
And then we have the
Simpson-Rodino law reform.

01:35:27.090 --> 01:35:30.570
We had a whole series on that.

01:35:30.570 --> 01:35:32.620
A symposium on Ernesto Galarza.

01:35:32.620 --> 01:35:36.290
I don't know if any one of you
knew who Ernesto Galarza was?

01:35:36.290 --> 01:35:40.240
He was a community organizer and
[foreign language] by the way,

01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:42.710
had a doctorate as well
and it was very interested

01:35:42.710 --> 01:35:44.010
in the [foreign language]
program.

01:35:44.010 --> 01:35:48.360
And it was actually he who was
some say he was responsible

01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:50.760
for raising awareness
about the expectation

01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:54.100
of [foreign language] and that's
why, you know, it was erased

01:35:54.100 --> 01:35:56.960
from being a U.S. program.

01:35:56.960 --> 01:36:01.660
We have interviews with
[foreign language], for example,

01:36:01.660 --> 01:36:03.910
in our studios, [foreign
language], and these are,

01:36:03.910 --> 01:36:07.240
how would I say,
traditional music stars.

01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:11.490
[Foreign language] from
Arizona and then California.

01:36:11.490 --> 01:36:12.790
And then we also have
[foreign language], you know,

01:36:12.790 --> 01:36:18.540
traditional music, you
know, accordion player.

01:36:18.540 --> 01:36:27.880
Bert Corona, another community
organizer, [foreign language]

01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:31.410
and then went on to California.

01:36:31.410 --> 01:36:32.710
And so on.

01:36:32.710 --> 01:36:35.790
And so, we have,
you know, a lot of,

01:36:35.790 --> 01:36:40.100
of voices including
those of our listeners.

01:36:40.100 --> 01:36:41.720
And that's something
that we pride a lot,

01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:44.150
take a lot of pride in.

01:36:44.150 --> 01:36:48.530
I wanted to just quote,
because we do have

01:36:48.530 --> 01:36:50.160
over the air fundraising.

01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:54.240
And even though our listeners do
not have much disposal income,

01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:57.130
we do every year for about
a week we get on the air,

01:36:57.130 --> 01:36:59.420
just like other public
radio stations and ask

01:36:59.420 --> 01:37:01.360
for financial support.

01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:04.650
So, there's some notes that
I want to read from some

01:37:04.650 --> 01:37:07.160
of the people that when asked
why do you want to make,

01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:10.000
you know, a 35 dollar
contribution.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:13.730
And from Crystal City, Texas,
where we have a radio station,

01:37:13.730 --> 01:37:16.260
you'll hear something like
well this is [foreign language]

01:37:16.260 --> 01:37:18.960
from Crystal, this is Radio
Bilingue a communication

01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:20.900
channel, it has helped me a lot.

01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:23.290
It identifies itself
with the poor,

01:37:23.290 --> 01:37:25.450
humble people and
with immigrants.

01:37:25.450 --> 01:37:27.130
It is a blessing
and a reflection

01:37:27.130 --> 01:37:29.910
of what is going on here.

01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:33.800
And then, another one, it says,

01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:38.010
Rosa [foreign language]
says I'm a huge fan

01:37:38.010 --> 01:37:40.530
of the [foreign language]
show, which is on Saturdays.

01:37:40.530 --> 01:37:42.850
Radio Bilingue is one of
the few public stations

01:37:42.850 --> 01:37:45.600
that really lives up to
its mission with a mix

01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:48.550
of information, music and PSA's.

01:37:48.550 --> 01:37:53.740
And so, and then another one
says, Carmen from Riverdale,

01:37:53.740 --> 01:37:56.680
I greatly appreciate Radio
Bilingue's programming,

01:37:56.680 --> 01:37:58.720
especially your information
programs.

01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:01.030
I have learned a lot by
listening to Radio Bilingue.

01:38:01.030 --> 01:38:05.280
I also like that you treat
people with much respect.

01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:07.820
So, with that, what
I want to do is,

01:38:07.820 --> 01:38:10.500
let's see if we can
play the audio.

01:38:10.500 --> 01:38:13.970
Do I do it here, or?

01:38:23.060 --> 01:38:24.910
&gt;&gt; [Music] are you
scanning through the radio?

01:38:24.910 --> 01:38:26.590
You just made the right choice.

01:38:26.590 --> 01:38:29.510
You're listening
to Radio Bilingue.

01:38:29.510 --> 01:38:36.060
[ Foreign language ]

01:38:36.060 --> 01:38:38.890
&gt;&gt; This is a big deal, isn't
it for Imperial County,

01:38:38.890 --> 01:38:42.510
for all of California, I
suppose, juvenile justice.

01:38:42.510 --> 01:38:55.120
[ Foreign language ]

01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:57.090
&gt;&gt; You're not thinking
about eating those 22 packs

01:38:57.090 --> 01:38:58.620
of sugar, are you, honey?

01:38:58.620 --> 01:38:59.920
&gt;&gt; Why not, Mom.

01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:01.220
You drink them every day.

01:39:01.220 --> 01:39:03.020
&gt;&gt; What are you talking about?

01:39:03.020 --> 01:39:14.040
[ Foreign language ]

01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:16.250
&gt;&gt; We have a great
listening audience

01:39:16.250 --> 01:39:19.930
and they know their music
in mariachi, oldies,

01:39:19.930 --> 01:39:21.230
[foreign language], salsa,

01:39:21.230 --> 01:39:23.540
[foreign language]
and so much more.

01:39:23.540 --> 01:39:24.840
We are.

01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:26.140
&gt;&gt; Radio Bilingue.

01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:27.440
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:29.240
&gt;&gt; Hugo Morales:
Thank you so much.

01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:51.500
[ Applause ]

01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:52.800
&gt;&gt; Monica de la Torre:
Good morning everybody.

01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:55.580
My name is Monica de la Torre
and I am honored to be here

01:39:55.580 --> 01:39:58.810
with this amazing panel
of Spanish language

01:39:58.810 --> 01:40:01.830
and multilingual radio
and I'm especially honored

01:40:01.830 --> 01:40:05.330
to be sitting next to Rosa
Ramón, one of the cofounders,

01:40:05.330 --> 01:40:07.600
the only woman cofounder
of Radio KDNA,

01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:11.030
the nation's first full time
Spanish language noncommercial

01:40:11.030 --> 01:40:12.470
radio station in
the United States

01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:16.320
that was founded,
went on air in 1979.

01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:20.490
And was, just completely
revolutionized the ways

01:40:20.490 --> 01:40:23.120
in which we understand Spanish
language radio, particularly

01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:26.030
when it comes to intentionally
incorporating women

01:40:26.030 --> 01:40:28.380
into broadcasting as producers,

01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:31.200
as news directors,
as station manager.

01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:33.750
Rosa was the first station
manager of Radio KDNA.

01:40:33.750 --> 01:40:36.200
And so, today, I'm just
going to go briefly

01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:40.230
into our work together
in attempting to archive

01:40:40.230 --> 01:40:43.080
and preserve the
history of Radio KDNA.

01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:45.540
It is located in
Granger, Washington,

01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:48.020
which is in Eastern Washington.

01:40:48.020 --> 01:40:51.670
And it's the agricultural hub of
the area, a lot of farm workers,

01:40:51.670 --> 01:40:55.880
especially Spanish speaking,
Mexican, Mexican American,

01:40:55.880 --> 01:40:59.070
Chicanos that beginning
in the 1950's migrated

01:40:59.070 --> 01:41:01.940
to the Pacific Northwest
to work in the hops,

01:41:01.940 --> 01:41:05.290
apples, cherries, asparagus.

01:41:05.290 --> 01:41:06.590
You name it, they're there.

01:41:06.590 --> 01:41:13.360
So, it's important for me to
particularly bring awareness

01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:14.860
to the fact that women have been

01:41:14.860 --> 01:41:16.980
from the beginning
a vital component

01:41:16.980 --> 01:41:18.980
of community radio production.

01:41:18.980 --> 01:41:20.490
And this is an image here.

01:41:20.490 --> 01:41:23.840
I'm going to go through some of
the images that we've been able

01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:26.220
to digitize and because
of Rosa's efforts right

01:41:26.220 --> 01:41:29.070
from the beginning to document
and preserve and the history

01:41:29.070 --> 01:41:33.260
of the station, KDNA
has a really rich visual

01:41:33.260 --> 01:41:34.730
and sonic archive.

01:41:34.730 --> 01:41:38.600
And so, this is an image
here, you see Rosa also there

01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:42.420
in the image sitting on the
truck constructing the tower

01:41:42.420 --> 01:41:47.420
on [inaudible] Ridge,
right outside of Granger.

01:41:47.420 --> 01:41:51.100
And this is a map of the
work that Radio KDNA did

01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:54.310
from the beginning to
begin to address the lack

01:41:54.310 --> 01:41:58.080
of Spanish language
news in broadcasting.

01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:01.440
Prior to this, Spanish language
news was translated from English

01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:03.940
and didn't really
speak to the issues

01:42:03.940 --> 01:42:05.320
that communities
were interested in.

01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:08.290
And so, Radio KDNA and their
organizing efforts beginning

01:42:08.290 --> 01:42:11.690
in 1975 created the Spanish
language news network

01:42:11.690 --> 01:42:13.170
that you see here a map

01:42:13.170 --> 01:42:15.760
of all the different
radio stations both,

01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:19.180
that included commercial
stations of how they were able

01:42:19.180 --> 01:42:23.390
to create and produce news and
Rosa can probably speak better

01:42:23.390 --> 01:42:24.730
about this than I can.

01:42:24.730 --> 01:42:28.280
But, here is another image
of the radio station now.

01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:32.120
And you see here the
logo, the farm worker,

01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:35.750
that is really vital to
Radio KDNA as being the voice

01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:37.050
of the farmer [foreign
language].

01:42:37.050 --> 01:42:42.310
And so, I wanted to play
really quickly a clip of one

01:42:42.310 --> 01:42:45.960
of the women that was involved
in the radio trainee program,

01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:50.910
[foreign language], who speaks
about what it meant to her

01:42:50.910 --> 01:42:54.940
to learn broadcasting, but also
to have the support of women.

01:42:54.940 --> 01:42:57.270
So, I'll play that.

01:42:57.270 --> 01:43:00.860
And then I'll let
Rosa speak for a bit.

01:43:07.010 --> 01:43:08.310
&gt;&gt; [Music].

01:43:08.310 --> 01:43:12.140
[Foreign language]
was born in Mexico.

01:43:12.140 --> 01:43:15.780
She is a wife and a mother to
a young five-year-old child.

01:43:15.780 --> 01:43:18.690
A farm worker for most
of her young 23 years,

01:43:18.690 --> 01:43:20.680
[foreign language] experience
with Radio KDNA began

01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:22.790
as a trainee in radio
broadcasting.

01:43:22.790 --> 01:43:25.510
Now, she is Radio KDNA's
Public Affairs producer.

01:43:25.510 --> 01:43:28.420
&gt;&gt; Being a public affairs
producer is exciting.

01:43:28.420 --> 01:43:30.890
Some of the things I have
to do is screen three

01:43:30.890 --> 01:43:33.680
to four newspapers a
day for news relevant

01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:37.610
to the Chicano community, plus
information and news releases

01:43:37.610 --> 01:43:39.670
that come into the
station daily.

01:43:39.670 --> 01:43:44.730
I also cover local news
story, which require research,

01:43:44.730 --> 01:43:48.560
interviews, attending
meetings and press conferences.

01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:50.680
Then, I have to write my scripts

01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:53.590
for the two news
programs I produce.

01:43:53.590 --> 01:43:57.510
Producing news takes a lot of
time, plus raising a family,

01:43:57.510 --> 01:44:01.630
but my family is
very understanding.

01:44:01.630 --> 01:44:03.600
My daughter sometimes
is very proud of me.

01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:06.650
She tells all her friends that
her mommy's a disk jockey.

01:44:06.650 --> 01:44:10.320
My families very proud of me
too, because they can't believe

01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:12.150
that I'm working
in a radio station.

01:44:12.150 --> 01:44:17.630
I thought that I better get into
something else besides farm work

01:44:17.630 --> 01:44:21.750
and I thought I would
give my parents something

01:44:21.750 --> 01:44:27.090
to be proud of, to being in a
radio station and be a mother

01:44:27.090 --> 01:44:29.510
and raise a family and
work at the same time.

01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:30.810
And work at the same time.

01:44:30.810 --> 01:44:33.420
And do something that
will help the community.

01:44:33.420 --> 01:44:38.670
I plan to take some
classes for communications.

01:44:38.670 --> 01:44:43.170
The very first time I did the
news live, it was my first time,

01:44:43.170 --> 01:44:45.970
I was very, very nervous.

01:44:45.970 --> 01:44:50.600
And after my news was
over, I came out and Rosa

01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:52.880
and Estella were waiting
for me at the door

01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:54.680
and they were applauding me.

01:44:54.680 --> 01:44:58.370
And that made me feel really
good because I get a lot

01:44:58.370 --> 01:45:05.090
of support from them and I think
that's what keeps me going.

01:45:05.090 --> 01:45:08.400
&gt;&gt; Monica de la Torre: So, I
love that clip for many reasons.

01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:12.290
One, we hear, to be able to
hear [foreign language] voice.

01:45:12.290 --> 01:45:16.440
Some of the programming that's
specifically was about women

01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:19.310
that Radio KDNA had a program
called [foreign language] Woman.

01:45:19.310 --> 01:45:22.010
A lot of those shows, as
Hugo mentioned earlier,

01:45:22.010 --> 01:45:24.790
are not archived because
of a lack of resources.

01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:26.920
A lot of the tapes were reused.

01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:30.810
And so, to be able to
have this, this gem of,

01:45:30.810 --> 01:45:32.560
being able to listen to
[foreign language] to talk

01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:36.430
about how important it was for
her to get into broadcasting,

01:45:36.430 --> 01:45:38.660
in very practical means

01:45:38.660 --> 01:45:40.370
of finding different
employment outside

01:45:40.370 --> 01:45:42.140
of farm work, I think
is important.

01:45:42.140 --> 01:45:44.340
And then, the fact
that she doesn't have

01:45:44.340 --> 01:45:47.600
to negotiate her different
identities as a mother,

01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:51.450
as a woman, as somebody
that's interested in radio.

01:45:51.450 --> 01:45:55.040
That all those aspects of her
identity were embraced and put

01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:57.130
on air through the programming
and through her voice.

01:45:57.130 --> 01:46:00.650
So, with that, I want
to hand it over to Rosa

01:46:00.650 --> 01:46:02.400
and show you a few more images.

01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:05.960
And I just want to say
how wonderful it's been

01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:07.260
to work with Rosa.

01:46:07.260 --> 01:46:10.450
I met her as a graduate
student and I interviewed her

01:46:10.450 --> 01:46:12.650
for a project called
Women who Rock.

01:46:12.650 --> 01:46:17.400
And it's an oral history project
that documents social activism

01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:20.020
and music and other
sonic communities.

01:46:20.020 --> 01:46:23.280
And the first time I met her, I
also have a background in radio

01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:24.610
like a lot of us here.

01:46:24.610 --> 01:46:29.980
And I just was so excited that
I had met another Chica that,

01:46:29.980 --> 01:46:32.420
you know, paved the way
for someone like myself.

01:46:32.420 --> 01:46:35.720
So, I'll let Rosa say a
little bit about the work

01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:37.020
that we've doing in archiving.

01:46:37.020 --> 01:46:38.570
She's been really instrumental.

01:46:38.570 --> 01:46:41.590
We've gone to the station
together to look for things,

01:46:41.590 --> 01:46:45.660
to look for programs, any sort
of archive that we can start

01:46:45.660 --> 01:46:48.770
to preserve this really
important history.

01:46:48.770 --> 01:46:50.140
&gt;&gt; Rosa Ramón: Hi, everybody.

01:46:50.140 --> 01:46:53.250
I'm so glad that
you're joining us today.

01:46:53.250 --> 01:46:55.290
And I hope that I
don't bore you.

01:46:55.290 --> 01:47:02.200
When Monica approached
me, I tried to avoid her.

01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:07.340
I was getting ready
to retire and thinking

01:47:07.340 --> 01:47:09.430
of having the life
of ease, right?

01:47:09.430 --> 01:47:17.280
And it was really her passion
for wanting to make sure

01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:20.970
that this information
was recorded,

01:47:20.970 --> 01:47:25.930
this story about Radio KDNA,
this story about the women,

01:47:25.930 --> 01:47:28.670
because in much of the history

01:47:28.670 --> 01:47:30.960
of the social movement women
actually, especially even

01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:32.470
in the Chicana movement,
women have kind

01:47:32.470 --> 01:47:34.940
of been left out of the picture.

01:47:34.940 --> 01:47:37.770
And so, her enthusiasm
to make sure that all

01:47:37.770 --> 01:47:43.390
of this was archived, was
recorded, was going to be

01:47:43.390 --> 01:47:49.120
in a position to be shared,
inspired me to get busy

01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:52.590
and to help her with
her project.

01:47:52.590 --> 01:47:55.410
And I did not know at the time.

01:47:55.410 --> 01:47:56.880
She mentioned the photography.

01:47:56.880 --> 01:47:59.460
I did not know at the time when.

01:47:59.460 --> 01:48:02.750
We were all quite young when
we started the radio station.

01:48:02.750 --> 01:48:05.600
And I wasn't quite poor as well.

01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:08.440
And one of the first things I
did when I had enough money was

01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:11.770
to buy a camera, just
a little Minolta camera

01:48:11.770 --> 01:48:15.260
that cost 100 bucks, which
then was a lot of money.

01:48:15.260 --> 01:48:18.090
And so, I began to
photograph everything.

01:48:18.090 --> 01:48:22.300
The. That's one of my pictures.

01:48:22.300 --> 01:48:26.930
The one in the truck
is one of my pictures.

01:48:26.930 --> 01:48:31.280
I photographed the station
from the beginning when we went

01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:35.100
to visit KBBF in
Santa Rosa California,

01:48:35.100 --> 01:48:39.690
which was the first bilingual
station in the country.

01:48:39.690 --> 01:48:44.070
And we were, none of us
had experience in radio.

01:48:44.070 --> 01:48:48.760
And so, we learned that there
was a station in Santa Rosa.

01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:51.440
And so, we took a group of
us there to talk to them.

01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:56.140
And so, I have photographs
from those earlier periods.

01:48:56.140 --> 01:48:59.750
Also, because we were poor,
we did all of our construction

01:48:59.750 --> 01:49:02.100
on our radio station by hand.

01:49:02.100 --> 01:49:03.960
We did the tower.

01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:07.260
We were not engineers, but
with the help of one engineer,

01:49:07.260 --> 01:49:09.020
we got volunteers,
community volunteers.

01:49:09.020 --> 01:49:11.790
So, it was really a station
that was built by the community.

01:49:11.790 --> 01:49:14.620
So, we did the tower.

01:49:14.620 --> 01:49:16.520
We put up the antenna.

01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:18.580
We dug the holes
on the mountain.

01:49:18.580 --> 01:49:23.230
Our tower is located on
Yakima National Tribal Land.

01:49:23.230 --> 01:49:26.280
We worked with them on
getting a reasonable price.

01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:28.730
And so, we did all
of the digging

01:49:28.730 --> 01:49:30.030
and the moving of the rocks.

01:49:30.030 --> 01:49:31.940
Everything was done by
hand for Radio KDNA.

01:49:31.940 --> 01:49:35.600
It's a very special
radio station,

01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:38.190
in that its way up
in the Northwest.

01:49:38.190 --> 01:49:41.810
Many people didn't even know
there were Spanish people living

01:49:41.810 --> 01:49:43.900
in the Northwest at the time.

01:49:43.900 --> 01:49:46.910
And when the station first
went in the air, on the air,

01:49:46.910 --> 01:49:51.580
our audience was
really not immigrants,

01:49:51.580 --> 01:49:55.920
because the first arrivals to
do agriculture work in the State

01:49:55.920 --> 01:50:01.320
of Washington were
American citizens, Texans,

01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:04.930
people from California, people
from the Midwest that moved

01:50:04.930 --> 01:50:09.370
into Washington State, but
primarily [foreign language].

01:50:09.370 --> 01:50:14.580
And then, later on, as, of
course, immigration increases,

01:50:14.580 --> 01:50:16.900
the station, of course, which
is one of the beautiful things

01:50:16.900 --> 01:50:20.560
about radio is its flexibility
to be able to really focus

01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:22.030
on the needs of its community.

01:50:22.030 --> 01:50:25.560
It was able to then adjust
itself to meet the needs of,

01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:28.090
you know, the immigrants that
were moving into the valley.

01:50:28.090 --> 01:50:30.430
So, its programming has
changed over the years,

01:50:30.430 --> 01:50:33.970
but initially it was
U.S. citizen Spanish

01:50:33.970 --> 01:50:35.830
speaking audience.

01:50:35.830 --> 01:50:38.360
So, that's just a little
bit of the history.

01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:42.240
And to just put in
context why it's so rare

01:50:42.240 --> 01:50:47.090
that this station actually
succeeded in the Northwest is

01:50:47.090 --> 01:50:53.970
because that area is extremely
rural, poor, very agricultural,

01:50:53.970 --> 01:50:56.590
very extremely conservative,

01:50:56.590 --> 01:51:00.960
all of the political positions
are held by the agricultural,

01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:03.940
representatives of the
agricultural industry.

01:51:03.940 --> 01:51:06.460
And so, there was a lot of fear

01:51:06.460 --> 01:51:09.940
about the station
coming into that area.

01:51:09.940 --> 01:51:12.790
And just, I don't
want to say a lot

01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:14.090
because there's just too much.

01:51:14.090 --> 01:51:15.810
I woke up at three o'clock
this morning trying to think

01:51:15.810 --> 01:51:18.490
of what I should say to
going back and looking

01:51:18.490 --> 01:51:19.850
at this 50 year history.

01:51:19.850 --> 01:51:21.150
And I though uh.

01:51:21.150 --> 01:51:22.460
So, I just want to,
just give you,

01:51:22.460 --> 01:51:26.210
just to give you one example
of what we dealt with.

01:51:26.210 --> 01:51:29.520
I was invited to
speak to a religious.

01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:31.160
The denomination doesn't matter.

01:51:31.160 --> 01:51:34.900
But a religious group and one of
the questions that they asked me

01:51:34.900 --> 01:51:39.010
in this interview, they
wanted to about Radio KDNA,

01:51:39.010 --> 01:51:42.470
was what do we say to our
parishioners when they think

01:51:42.470 --> 01:51:45.700
that your people are no
higher than the animals.

01:51:45.700 --> 01:51:48.130
So, that was one of the
first questions that I dealt

01:51:48.130 --> 01:51:51.820
with when our station
first went in the air.

01:51:51.820 --> 01:51:55.360
So, it gives you an idea
of why it's so remarkable

01:51:55.360 --> 01:51:57.720
that the first Spanish language
radio station should come

01:51:57.720 --> 01:52:01.960
out of this tiny, poor town
in the State of Washington.

01:52:01.960 --> 01:52:06.040
And that it has accomplished
what it has done.

01:52:06.040 --> 01:52:12.730
In terms of one very
important issue tackling AIDS

01:52:12.730 --> 01:52:14.400
within the Latino community.

01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:16.560
It was horrible and there
wasn't any information going

01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:17.860
out in Spanish.

01:52:17.860 --> 01:52:22.330
Radio KDNA took that on and did
a national program in Spanish.

01:52:22.330 --> 01:52:25.810
It did a radio drama
series in Spanish

01:52:25.810 --> 01:52:28.150
to educate the Latino community.

01:52:28.150 --> 01:52:34.220
So, that's, that's the kind of
station, you know, that it is.

01:52:34.220 --> 01:52:35.650
And I don't want
to go on too long.

01:52:35.650 --> 01:52:36.950
It's just too much.

01:52:36.950 --> 01:52:38.720
But I thank you for being here.

01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:41.510
And I'm happy to answer
any questions later too.

01:52:41.510 --> 01:52:46.010
[ Applause ]

01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:47.310
&gt;&gt; Delores Inés
Casillas: [Inaudible]

01:52:47.310 --> 01:52:51.360
and then we'll have
Joy and then wrap it

01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:54.530
up with Alex and
Caribbean radio.

01:53:05.920 --> 01:53:10.300
Hold on a minute.

01:53:10.300 --> 01:53:11.600
Sorry. [Inaudible].

01:53:11.600 --> 01:53:18.120
Oh I think I do.

01:53:18.120 --> 01:53:20.760
Oh no there it goes.

01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:22.630
&gt;&gt; Magaly Rivera:
Good morning everyone.

01:53:22.630 --> 01:53:24.590
Thank you so much
for being here.

01:53:24.590 --> 01:53:29.020
I want to see this place filled.

01:53:29.020 --> 01:53:30.320
I represent.

01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:34.900
I'm the Executive Director the
Latino Public Radio Consortium

01:53:34.900 --> 01:53:37.590
and we represent and service

01:53:37.590 --> 01:53:41.440
over 50 Latino public
radio stations,

01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:45.610
such as KDNA, Radio Bilingue.

01:53:45.610 --> 01:53:47.730
And the services that we provide

01:53:47.730 --> 01:53:52.660
to the station is working
towards their sustainability.

01:53:52.660 --> 01:53:55.780
We host an annual Latino
summit, where we bring all

01:53:55.780 --> 01:53:57.400
of the stations together.

01:53:57.400 --> 01:54:02.380
And when you think of us
as a national organization

01:54:02.380 --> 01:54:07.340
and you look at just the
two examples that you saw

01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:13.120
of two very distinctive
long serving radio stations

01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:18.840
and you look at radio stations
like Latino Public Radio

01:54:18.840 --> 01:54:23.750
in [foreign language], which has
a large Puerto Rican population.

01:54:23.750 --> 01:54:34.190
You look at WDNA, which is in
Miami, an all jazz station.

01:54:34.190 --> 01:54:39.020
They put on the first Latino
jazz festival last year.

01:54:39.020 --> 01:54:42.570
And then you look
at another one,

01:54:42.570 --> 01:54:45.360
like Lancaster Pennsylvania
WLCH,

01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:51.640
whose parent organization
has a tech center,

01:54:51.640 --> 01:54:54.570
they have a senior
citizen center

01:54:54.570 --> 01:55:00.310
and their radio station is very
well known in the community

01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:02.360
and very well integrated.

01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:05.660
And when you look at the role
that the consortium plays

01:55:05.660 --> 01:55:08.360
in being a national umbrella,

01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:12.870
we look at what are the
commonalities of support

01:55:12.870 --> 01:55:15.980
that we can provide to them.

01:55:15.980 --> 01:55:19.870
And so, for us, it lies

01:55:19.870 --> 01:55:24.870
in collaboration,
talent and training.

01:55:24.870 --> 01:55:29.210
And these three things
also are important

01:55:29.210 --> 01:55:34.160
when we're talking
about preservation.

01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:36.370
Yesterday, Jennifer Lawson

01:55:36.370 --> 01:55:41.690
at the Pub Media 50th said
something that for me was so key

01:55:41.690 --> 01:55:44.160
and so important and
I had to give a shout

01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:46.790
out to her on Twitter.

01:55:46.790 --> 01:55:51.020
And she said, preservation
national yes,

01:55:51.020 --> 01:55:54.460
but let's not forget
local communities.

01:55:54.460 --> 01:55:59.580
And that is so significant
and I'm going

01:55:59.580 --> 01:56:07.430
to give you a very unfortunate
and vibrant picture of that.

01:56:07.430 --> 01:56:14.180
And that relates to what is
happening in Puerto Rico.

01:56:14.180 --> 01:56:18.410
We have five Latino
public radio stations

01:56:18.410 --> 01:56:22.360
that have been dramatically
affected by the hurricane.

01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:26.540
Obviously, preservation
and collection of all

01:56:26.540 --> 01:56:30.240
of the historical
news information

01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:37.990
that they hone has become a huge
and significant concern for us.

01:56:37.990 --> 01:56:44.050
WIPR, who is a state
responder, is on air.

01:56:44.050 --> 01:56:47.460
WRTU is working to get on air.

01:56:47.460 --> 01:56:52.980
The consortium is very,
very fortunate to be working

01:56:52.980 --> 01:56:55.770
in collaboration with
public media stations

01:56:55.770 --> 01:56:58.490
that have come forward
to support.

01:56:58.490 --> 01:57:01.380
There are still stations
that are off the air.

01:57:01.380 --> 01:57:04.530
There are still stations whose
collections are not being air

01:57:04.530 --> 01:57:07.460
conditioned, are not
being humidified.

01:57:07.460 --> 01:57:11.220
And part of the work that
the consortium is doing is

01:57:11.220 --> 01:57:13.970
to make sure that
we preserve that.

01:57:13.970 --> 01:57:16.310
We're thankful, obviously,
to the Corporation

01:57:16.310 --> 01:57:17.870
for Public Broadcasting.

01:57:17.870 --> 01:57:20.340
They have been our major
funder since the acception

01:57:20.340 --> 01:57:23.190
of the Latino Public
Radio Consortium.

01:57:23.190 --> 01:57:24.660
They have played a major role

01:57:24.660 --> 01:57:28.940
in providing emergency
funding to these stations.

01:57:28.940 --> 01:57:32.520
And they have also
played a major role

01:57:32.520 --> 01:57:36.800
in bringing forth stations
that can support us.

01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:42.560
Coast Alaska had these
radio to go kits.

01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:45.750
If you're not familiar
with them,

01:57:45.750 --> 01:57:50.700
you can go up on Coast Alaska,
but they're ready to go kits

01:57:50.700 --> 01:57:55.330
that they thought of when
they would have an emergency,

01:57:55.330 --> 01:57:58.960
in terms of being able
to continue to broadcast.

01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:02.780
And so, these type
of collaborations are

01:58:02.780 --> 01:58:08.790
so significant when we're
speaking to the preservation

01:58:08.790 --> 01:58:13.950
of news, when we're speaking
to the preservation of talent.

01:58:13.950 --> 01:58:19.130
I'm not suggesting that we
take human bodies and put them

01:58:19.130 --> 01:58:26.430
in preservations, but one of the
radio stations and I don't know

01:58:26.430 --> 01:58:30.080
if you know this, I should
say one of the radio stations,

01:58:30.080 --> 01:58:32.050
but there our dual broadcaster.

01:58:32.050 --> 01:58:35.860
They ceased operations
indefinitely.

01:58:35.860 --> 01:58:38.730
And on the same day that
they ceased operations,

01:58:38.730 --> 01:58:42.620
they let go of all their staff.

01:58:42.620 --> 01:58:46.120
We created a GoFundMe to be
able to help the stations.

01:58:46.120 --> 01:58:48.700
But the question behind that
is, is that when you look

01:58:48.700 --> 01:58:52.790
at the growth of public media
and you look at the work

01:58:52.790 --> 01:58:59.710
that these stations do in the
local community, we all know

01:58:59.710 --> 01:59:07.110
and just in the pictures that
she showed that in public media,

01:59:07.110 --> 01:59:11.210
when you enter public media as a
talent, you start as a trainee,

01:59:11.210 --> 01:59:13.530
you start as a volunteer.

01:59:13.530 --> 01:59:17.560
Some of us are more fortunate
and start in specific roles,

01:59:17.560 --> 01:59:21.760
but you have a tendency to
stay for a very long time.

01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:25.000
Radio has that kind
of effect, no.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:28.570
And so, our concerns
are with talent.

01:59:28.570 --> 01:59:32.530
And the growth of Latino public
media with respect to being able

01:59:32.530 --> 01:59:36.410
to look at that there
is the potential

01:59:36.410 --> 01:59:39.690
that Latino radio stations
that are struggling

01:59:39.690 --> 01:59:42.980
because they have one
or two team members,

01:59:42.980 --> 01:59:46.310
because they have
volunteers that come and go,

01:59:46.310 --> 01:59:51.800
because the universities
are not able to gear them

01:59:51.800 --> 01:59:54.570
into public media
as a career path.

01:59:54.570 --> 01:59:57.940
Now, I'm speaking to
Latino populations, right?

01:59:57.940 --> 02:00:05.930
When you consider how long
and hard NPR has been working

02:00:05.930 --> 02:00:12.540
to increase Latino talent, this
is all part of preservation.

02:00:12.540 --> 02:00:17.050
And collaboration is
so significant to that.

02:00:17.050 --> 02:00:20.450
As a consortium, we
serve over 50 stations.

02:00:20.450 --> 02:00:23.230
We're a two people staff.

02:00:23.230 --> 02:00:27.310
So, needless to say,
I don't sleep a lot.

02:00:27.310 --> 02:00:30.820
And the other thing about
that is had it not been

02:00:30.820 --> 02:00:35.520
for Coast Alaska to come forward
with the radio to go kits,

02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:40.490
had it not been for WNYC to
offer their engineers to fly

02:00:40.490 --> 02:00:48.480
to Puerto Rico to help WIPR FM
get back on air, had it not been

02:00:48.480 --> 02:00:53.860
for WMFV Orlando, who delivered
the second radio kit and worked

02:00:53.860 --> 02:00:57.420
with their own partners
to get a charter plane

02:00:57.420 --> 02:00:59.450
to deliver the equipment.

02:00:59.450 --> 02:01:04.860
The collaboration of
public media is significant

02:01:04.860 --> 02:01:09.380
to the preservation of
Latino radio stations.

02:01:09.380 --> 02:01:14.740
The local community and the
work and all of the news,

02:01:14.740 --> 02:01:18.080
when you think about
the California fires,

02:01:18.080 --> 02:01:23.400
I think of KBBF, one of the only
radio stations that was able

02:01:23.400 --> 02:01:29.480
to cover information
and news in Spanish.

02:01:29.480 --> 02:01:35.080
Okay. Radio Bilingue also did
a lot of important interviews.

02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:37.990
They did so with
respect to Puerto Rico,

02:01:37.990 --> 02:01:43.010
even though their population
is predominantly Mexican.

02:01:43.010 --> 02:01:49.770
So, our role as a consortium is
to bring forth collaboration,

02:01:49.770 --> 02:01:54.430
so that we can continue
to grow Latino media,

02:01:54.430 --> 02:01:58.440
specifically radio.

02:01:58.440 --> 02:02:06.650
When I think of KSVR, within
the CCPB, we support 11 stations

02:02:06.650 --> 02:02:09.950
that are CSG qualified.

02:02:09.950 --> 02:02:12.140
For that, that means
that is the funding

02:02:12.140 --> 02:02:14.790
that the corporation
provides to us.

02:02:14.790 --> 02:02:17.390
They are our predominant funder.

02:02:17.390 --> 02:02:18.700
So, we are required

02:02:18.700 --> 02:02:23.120
to specifically service
those 11 stations.

02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:26.200
We have 50 that want
to be serviced.

02:02:26.200 --> 02:02:33.370
And so, the collaboration
of entities that come forth,

02:02:33.370 --> 02:02:39.400
like WNYC, WMFE, are so
significant and when I look

02:02:39.400 --> 02:02:44.450
at just public, the public media
system as a whole and our vision

02:02:44.450 --> 02:02:48.840
to make it a more inclusive
public media, I would love

02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:50.680
to see more partnerships.

02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:53.350
I would love to see the
consortium contacted

02:02:53.350 --> 02:02:56.710
by general market
stations to look at ways

02:02:56.710 --> 02:03:01.130
to support our growth,
our local stations in all

02:03:01.130 --> 02:03:02.950
of the different markets.

02:03:02.950 --> 02:03:05.560
That is preservation of media.

02:03:05.560 --> 02:03:07.670
To be able to look at
the current problems

02:03:07.670 --> 02:03:11.760
that we're facing and you
spoke to Radio Vieques.

02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:14.030
Radio Vieques is off air.

02:03:14.030 --> 02:03:16.310
They have been off air.

02:03:16.310 --> 02:03:22.340
However, they took a truck,
the put two speakers on it

02:03:22.340 --> 02:03:24.700
and they have been roaming
throughout the island

02:03:24.700 --> 02:03:27.200
of Vieques ensuring news,

02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:31.840
ensuring information,
ensuring resources.

02:03:31.840 --> 02:03:37.090
And we're hoping in
another week to be able

02:03:37.090 --> 02:03:42.740
to issue a press release that
will give insight to our work

02:03:42.740 --> 02:03:45.770
in getting Radio
Vieques back on air.

02:03:45.770 --> 02:03:50.830
And interestingly enough, when
you look at Puerto Rico and all

02:03:50.830 --> 02:03:53.270
of the different topics that
have surfaced with respect

02:03:53.270 --> 02:03:57.410
to Puerto Rico being a
colony, am I a U.S. citizen?

02:03:57.410 --> 02:03:59.890
Because yes I am Puerto Rican.

02:03:59.890 --> 02:04:09.560
And the history of Puerto Rico,
you know, I don't know how many

02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:13.550
of you know there is
the [foreign language],

02:04:13.550 --> 02:04:19.960
which has over 100 years
of archival collections,

02:04:19.960 --> 02:04:23.080
which is American history.

02:04:23.080 --> 02:04:26.200
And the reason its
American history is

02:04:26.200 --> 02:04:28.930
because Puerto Ricans
are American.

02:04:28.930 --> 02:04:31.040
And I'm not being
[inaudible] in saying this.

02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:33.390
I need to repeat it.

02:04:33.390 --> 02:04:39.150
And because [foreign language]
was a very loved governor,

02:04:39.150 --> 02:04:42.620
had a very close and
wonderful friendship

02:04:42.620 --> 02:04:45.600
with Rockefeller,
Nelson Rockefeller.

02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:49.710
There are letters
and videos and audios

02:04:49.710 --> 02:04:52.340
and so much wonderful
information

02:04:52.340 --> 02:04:58.760
that our radio stations go
to this foundation to obtain.

02:04:58.760 --> 02:05:03.750
And through a separate
role, I was fortunate

02:05:03.750 --> 02:05:08.260
to work very closely with
[foreign language] Foundation.

02:05:08.260 --> 02:05:12.070
And I was in awe of the amount

02:05:12.070 --> 02:05:15.410
of American history
that they have.

02:05:15.410 --> 02:05:17.520
And I even wonder how many

02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:23.450
of our public media stations
utilize it, know about it.

02:05:23.450 --> 02:05:26.420
All of the stations in
Puerto Rico turn to them

02:05:26.420 --> 02:05:29.720
when they're looking
for historical data.

02:05:29.720 --> 02:05:35.520
So, my message, which I hope
that these very few of you

02:05:35.520 --> 02:05:39.240
who are here in this
audience will take to all

02:05:39.240 --> 02:05:46.340
of your colleagues is the
consortium needs collaborations.

02:05:46.340 --> 02:05:50.300
The, KSVR, which I
started to mention before

02:05:50.300 --> 02:05:55.100
and my mind deviated
for a moment,

02:05:55.100 --> 02:05:59.740
in Mount Vernon has
a growing population.

02:05:59.740 --> 02:06:04.100
And they're thwarted because
they're limited in their ability

02:06:04.100 --> 02:06:10.230
to provide content and
they air in English.

02:06:10.230 --> 02:06:14.290
And they don't only air
to a Latino audience.

02:06:14.290 --> 02:06:20.010
So, my question is, how do I
sit sleepless nights trying

02:06:20.010 --> 02:06:27.810
to figure out how I help KSVR
enhance their programming

02:06:27.810 --> 02:06:33.990
when there is a wealth of
public media system executives

02:06:33.990 --> 02:06:40.260
with talent, expertise,
knowledge, content.

02:06:40.260 --> 02:06:43.580
And so, that's my message.

02:06:43.580 --> 02:06:48.990
I would love to see our local
community stations continue

02:06:48.990 --> 02:06:50.660
to thrive.

02:06:50.660 --> 02:06:57.240
I would love to know that our
Puerto Rico stations do not have

02:06:57.240 --> 02:06:59.460
to cease operations.

02:06:59.460 --> 02:07:03.660
That despite what has
happened with the hurricane

02:07:03.660 --> 02:07:08.750
that there are ways and the
only way that that can happen is

02:07:08.750 --> 02:07:13.240
through the support
of our colleagues.

02:07:13.240 --> 02:07:14.550
That's the only way.

02:07:14.550 --> 02:07:16.430
Am I past my time?

02:07:16.430 --> 02:07:17.730
[Inaudible].

02:07:17.730 --> 02:07:19.340
Okay. Thank you.

02:07:19.340 --> 02:07:22.180
I really thank you so much.

02:07:22.180 --> 02:07:25.980
If you really want to know
who our radio stations are,

02:07:25.980 --> 02:07:29.760
on our website, when
you go to publications,

02:07:29.760 --> 02:07:32.800
there's a publication
called a snapshot.

02:07:32.800 --> 02:07:38.340
It gives a very detailed insight
on each single radio station.

02:07:38.340 --> 02:07:41.840
If you want to know how you can
help our Puerto Rico stations,

02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:44.560
on our homepage there's
a GoFundMe.

02:07:44.560 --> 02:07:48.370
But there is also a list of
all of the different things

02:07:48.370 --> 02:07:53.200
that we're doing to help bring
the Puerto Rico stations back

02:07:53.200 --> 02:07:54.910
to full capacity.

02:07:54.910 --> 02:08:00.340
We know we will get them back
on air on a short term basis.

02:08:00.340 --> 02:08:03.060
But we need the public
media system to be able

02:08:03.060 --> 02:08:07.840
to help not only Puerto Rico,
but all of our radio stations.

02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:09.640
So, thank you.

02:08:09.640 --> 02:08:18.270
[ Applause ]

02:08:18.270 --> 02:08:21.140
&gt;&gt; We might not have time
for questions right now

02:08:21.140 --> 02:08:23.640
because I want to give time

02:08:23.640 --> 02:08:26.690
for the Caribbean
[inaudible] to speak.

02:08:26.690 --> 02:08:27.990
[Inaudible].

02:08:27.990 --> 02:08:30.590
I hope we can all stick around.

02:08:30.590 --> 02:08:31.890
&gt;&gt; Joy Hayes: Alrighty.

02:08:31.890 --> 02:08:34.620
Well, it's my pleasure
to be here.

02:08:34.620 --> 02:08:38.880
As Ines said, I'm, my
specialization is in U.S.

02:08:38.880 --> 02:08:41.440
and Mexican broadcasting
history.

02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:46.440
But, I got interesting from
the [inaudible] perspective

02:08:46.440 --> 02:08:51.340
in Latino, Latina media and
radio in particular because it's

02:08:51.340 --> 02:08:53.470
such an interesting history.

02:08:53.470 --> 02:08:57.410
It's, it's the story
of American radio.

02:08:57.410 --> 02:09:03.650
And so, I see that as something
that needs to be included

02:09:03.650 --> 02:09:05.250
in the broader picture.

02:09:05.250 --> 02:09:09.070
So, I guess I would just
stick to a few points here.

02:09:09.070 --> 02:09:12.950
I think the panelists have
made excellent arguments

02:09:12.950 --> 02:09:18.130
about the essential everyday
role that radio plays

02:09:18.130 --> 02:09:22.010
in the community and
particularly for Latinos.

02:09:22.010 --> 02:09:23.990
And that's the fundamental
thing.

02:09:23.990 --> 02:09:27.240
But also is the sort
of cultural mission,

02:09:27.240 --> 02:09:30.060
the sort of giving
a cultural outlet.

02:09:30.060 --> 02:09:34.180
And this reminds me of the
research of [foreign language]

02:09:34.180 --> 02:09:40.660
in Columbia, who sort of looks
at, you know, it's the process

02:09:40.660 --> 02:09:45.340
of making radio that
constructs the community.

02:09:45.340 --> 02:09:50.830
And I think all these cases have
really showed the importance

02:09:50.830 --> 02:09:52.790
of that.

02:09:52.790 --> 02:09:58.130
The other couple of issues
I would just bring up is,

02:09:58.130 --> 02:09:59.720
a couple of interesting
things I think.

02:09:59.720 --> 02:10:04.750
One is that while this is on
the one hand a national story.

02:10:04.750 --> 02:10:08.240
It's also fundamentally
transnational, right?

02:10:08.240 --> 02:10:11.840
All of the, all of the
communities have ties

02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:15.510
to other parts of the world,
to the parts of Latin America

02:10:15.510 --> 02:10:20.200
and those ties are
part of the story.

02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:23.660
And so, we need to think of it,
not just in a national context,

02:10:23.660 --> 02:10:25.200
but in a transnational context.

02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:28.220
And then, finally, you know,

02:10:28.220 --> 02:10:33.550
I think all these cases really
show that these are local

02:10:33.550 --> 02:10:36.990
or regional cultures,
right, that are getting,

02:10:36.990 --> 02:10:39.890
that are using the
medium of radio.

02:10:39.890 --> 02:10:46.390
And that presents difficulties,
I guess, around preservation.

02:10:46.390 --> 02:10:50.260
And I think obviously, as
we've discussed the idea

02:10:50.260 --> 02:10:54.910
of collaboration is what's going
to make this, bring these local

02:10:54.910 --> 02:11:00.050
and regional expressions
and uses of radio into sort

02:11:00.050 --> 02:11:03.520
of broader national picture
in transnational picture

02:11:03.520 --> 02:11:11.710
of what Spanish language,
multilingual radio is all about.

02:11:11.710 --> 02:11:14.390
So, those are just the
points I wanted to make.

02:11:14.390 --> 02:11:18.510
And I've really enjoyed
hearing from all the panelists.

02:11:18.510 --> 02:11:25.100
[ Applause ]

02:11:25.100 --> 02:11:27.190
&gt;&gt; Alejandra Bronfman: So,
we're just going to get started.

02:11:27.190 --> 02:11:28.490
We don't have too much time.

02:11:28.490 --> 02:11:30.780
But I am told that there is
nothing here until two o'clock,

02:11:30.780 --> 02:11:33.860
so if people, if we want
to stay a little bit longer

02:11:33.860 --> 02:11:37.710
if you're not too
hunger, we can.

02:11:37.710 --> 02:11:39.120
It's really an honor to be here.

02:11:39.120 --> 02:11:42.930
It's an honor to share this time
with all of these amazing people

02:11:42.930 --> 02:11:44.390
and I'm just, I'm
really inspired

02:11:44.390 --> 02:11:46.000
by the presentations
that I just heard.

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:47.570
And I really hope that
we can have a good

02:11:47.570 --> 02:11:48.870
conversation afterwards.

02:11:48.870 --> 02:11:52.840
It's also an honor to be,
to have sort of been able

02:11:52.840 --> 02:11:57.370
to convene this panel with
these incredibly distinguished

02:11:57.370 --> 02:12:00.400
archivists, librarians
and researchers.

02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:03.960
And what I'm going to do is
just quickly introduce everybody

02:12:03.960 --> 02:12:06.910
and without much
further ado get going.

02:12:06.910 --> 02:12:12.890
So, we have, we have to
my left, Craig Breaden,

02:12:12.890 --> 02:12:14.730
who has been the
audiovisual archivist

02:12:14.730 --> 02:12:18.540
at Duke Universities Rubenstein
Rare Book and Manuscript Library

02:12:18.540 --> 02:12:20.950
and prior to that was head
of the Media and Oral History

02:12:20.950 --> 02:12:22.670
at the Russell Library at
the University of Georgia.

02:12:22.670 --> 02:12:25.290
At Duke he processes
and advised on AV

02:12:25.290 --> 02:12:29.490
and oral history collections
and since 2015 he's been,

02:12:29.490 --> 02:12:31.730
he's managed Voices of
Change, which is as two

02:12:31.730 --> 02:12:34.290
and a half year project
funded by NEH to preserve

02:12:34.290 --> 02:12:36.610
and describe the
recordings of Radio Haiti,

02:12:36.610 --> 02:12:38.110
which is Haiti's
voice of democracy.

02:12:38.110 --> 02:12:40.040
And if you don't know
about that project,

02:12:40.040 --> 02:12:41.340
he will tell you more about it.

02:12:41.340 --> 02:12:42.640
The other two people
who are working

02:12:42.640 --> 02:12:45.290
on that project were not
able to be here today.

02:12:45.290 --> 02:12:48.820
But it's quite an
amazing collection.

02:12:48.820 --> 02:12:51.450
He will be followed by
Christine Heranadez,

02:12:51.450 --> 02:12:53.960
who is currently Curator
of Special Collections

02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:57.010
at Latin American Library
at Tulane University.

02:12:57.010 --> 02:12:59.930
She has a masters and PhD
in anthropology from Tulane.

02:12:59.930 --> 02:13:03.270
And has published widely on
the archeology of Mesoamerica,

02:13:03.270 --> 02:13:05.230
specializing the prehistory
of [foreign language]

02:13:05.230 --> 02:13:06.740
and the [foreign
language] regions

02:13:06.740 --> 02:13:08.650
of North and Central Mexico.

02:13:08.650 --> 02:13:11.940
And pre Hispanic painted Maya
and Hyland Mexican codices.

02:13:11.940 --> 02:13:14.230
She is also the principal
collaborator and responsible

02:13:14.230 --> 02:13:16.800
for the electronic resource
the Maya codices database.

02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:19.970
And today she's going to be
talking about, I hope maybe,

02:13:19.970 --> 02:13:24.070
a collection of Cuban
[foreign language],

02:13:24.070 --> 02:13:26.270
which is really interesting.

02:13:26.270 --> 02:13:29.300
Jeff Rubin, her colleague, is
the head of Digital Initiatives

02:13:29.300 --> 02:13:32.580
and Publishing at Howard Tilton
Memorial Library at Tulane.

02:13:32.580 --> 02:13:35.770
He oversees the Tulane
University Digital Library,

02:13:35.770 --> 02:13:37.840
Tulane Journal publishing
and Electronic Thesis

02:13:37.840 --> 02:13:39.490
and Dissertations
Program as part

02:13:39.490 --> 02:13:42.470
of the Tulane University
Digital Repository.

02:13:42.470 --> 02:13:44.810
Over the past 18
years, Jeff has worked

02:13:44.810 --> 02:13:46.960
on numerous collaborative
digital library projects

02:13:46.960 --> 02:13:50.350
with regional, internal
and national partners.

02:13:50.350 --> 02:13:51.650
His work at Tulane focuses

02:13:51.650 --> 02:13:53.790
on developing new
digital library projects

02:13:53.790 --> 02:13:55.890
with collab areas from
across Tulane's campus

02:13:55.890 --> 02:13:58.790
and in building Tulane's
open access publishing unit.

02:13:58.790 --> 02:14:01.260
So, we have all of these
people who really sort

02:14:01.260 --> 02:14:03.490
of know what they're doing
in terms of archiving.

02:14:03.490 --> 02:14:05.250
It's an honor.

02:14:05.250 --> 02:14:10.100
And finally, one of
our panelists we have,

02:14:10.100 --> 02:14:14.480
or actually joining
the session, she may

02:14:14.480 --> 02:14:17.640
or may not be chiming in,
we have Ayanna Legros,

02:14:17.640 --> 02:14:19.970
who is a first year
history PhD student.

02:14:19.970 --> 02:14:24.250
And she has, she is sitting on
a really important radio archive

02:14:24.250 --> 02:14:27.480
that we hope to sort of
get going on preserving

02:14:27.480 --> 02:14:29.190
as part of this initiative.

02:14:29.190 --> 02:14:32.090
Our commenter today
will be Robert Horton,

02:14:32.090 --> 02:14:34.130
who is from the National
Museum of American History

02:14:34.130 --> 02:14:36.770
and he's assistant director
of collections and archives

02:14:36.770 --> 02:14:39.050
and I should say that
I'm Alejandra Bronfman.

02:14:39.050 --> 02:14:44.350
I teach Caribbean and Latin
American history at SUNY Albany.

02:14:44.350 --> 02:14:47.320
So, Christine.

02:14:47.320 --> 02:14:48.620
&gt;&gt; Christine Heranadez:
Thank you.

02:14:48.620 --> 02:14:49.920
&gt;&gt; Alejandra Bronfman:
Oh, sorry, Craig.

02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:51.220
Sorry.

02:14:51.220 --> 02:14:52.520
&gt;&gt; Craig Breaden: Okay.

02:14:52.520 --> 02:14:53.820
&gt;&gt; Alejandra Bronfman: Sorry.

02:14:53.820 --> 02:14:55.120
&gt;&gt; Craig Breaden: Excuse me.

02:14:55.120 --> 02:14:56.420
Woops. Turn it on.

02:14:56.420 --> 02:14:57.720
Good morning.

02:14:57.720 --> 02:14:59.020
Thank you for being here.

02:14:59.020 --> 02:15:02.210
I'm honored and humbled to be
among a group of people here,

02:15:02.210 --> 02:15:06.730
who are doing really cool things
and both creators and archivists

02:15:06.730 --> 02:15:10.020
and people who are
interested in what we're doing.

02:15:10.020 --> 02:15:11.490
I just. It's a great thing.

02:15:11.490 --> 02:15:12.790
So, thank you.

02:15:12.790 --> 02:15:14.090
I wanted to talk a little bit

02:15:14.090 --> 02:15:17.310
about our Radio Haiti
collection at Duke University.

02:15:17.310 --> 02:15:21.870
And this is coming
from somebody,

02:15:21.870 --> 02:15:23.950
who admittedly I'm an
audiovisual archivist.

02:15:23.950 --> 02:15:27.480
I work on a wide
variety of projects.

02:15:27.480 --> 02:15:30.710
I don't have the language to
be working on this project.

02:15:30.710 --> 02:15:34.470
I don't have the
cultural background

02:15:34.470 --> 02:15:35.800
to be working on this project.

02:15:35.800 --> 02:15:39.470
The person, who actually
probably should be sitting

02:15:39.470 --> 02:15:41.380
in my seat is the person
I manage on the project,

02:15:41.380 --> 02:15:45.780
Laura Wagner, who's a
brilliant scholar and writer

02:15:45.780 --> 02:15:50.420
and she is our soldier
on this project.

02:15:50.420 --> 02:15:52.290
So, I'm going to try to
represent what she's doing

02:15:52.290 --> 02:15:55.960
as best as I can as the
manager of the project.

02:15:55.960 --> 02:15:57.400
So, the Radio Haiti project.

02:15:57.400 --> 02:16:00.590
It's a preservation project.

02:16:00.590 --> 02:16:02.960
It's a description project.

02:16:02.960 --> 02:16:05.980
It's a repatriation project.

02:16:05.980 --> 02:16:10.060
And behind all of that,
it's a human rights project.

02:16:10.060 --> 02:16:15.570
And this is what really draws me
to it and keeps my heart in it.

02:16:15.570 --> 02:16:18.340
A little bit of background.

02:16:18.340 --> 02:16:22.770
Radio Haiti as a political
source in the voice of democracy

02:16:22.770 --> 02:16:28.650
in Haiti began in 1971, when
Jean Dominique, the station,

02:16:28.650 --> 02:16:31.640
the station's owner
bought the station.

02:16:31.640 --> 02:16:36.200
And over the next 30 years he
and his wife, Michele Montas,

02:16:36.200 --> 02:16:39.410
created this voice of democracy.

02:16:39.410 --> 02:16:43.230
And they kept going, even when
the station was off the air

02:16:43.230 --> 02:16:45.630
and they were in exile
in New York City.

02:16:45.630 --> 02:16:48.420
They came back twice to Haiti
before Jean Dominique was

02:16:48.420 --> 02:16:50.830
assassinated in 2000.

02:16:50.830 --> 02:16:55.160
If you're interested in that
story and it's an amazing story,

02:16:55.160 --> 02:16:58.110
Jonathan Demme made
a movie about him.

02:16:58.110 --> 02:16:59.410
It's a documentary.

02:16:59.410 --> 02:17:01.370
It's called the Agronomist.

02:17:01.370 --> 02:17:04.630
In 2013 10 years after
the station closed,

02:17:04.630 --> 02:17:07.150
because Michele kept the station
open for another three years

02:17:07.150 --> 02:17:09.420
after the assassination.

02:17:09.420 --> 02:17:12.160
She made the donation
to Duke University

02:17:12.160 --> 02:17:16.780
of the 37 hundred
tapes, which equals

02:17:16.780 --> 02:17:19.600
out to five thousand
300 digital files,

02:17:19.600 --> 02:17:24.020
about 27 hundred hours of audio.

02:17:24.020 --> 02:17:31.860
We secured an NEH grant in
2015 and with our obligation

02:17:31.860 --> 02:17:35.910
in that grant to provide digital
preservation of the audio

02:17:35.910 --> 02:17:40.200
and also basic description
of the tapes.

02:17:40.200 --> 02:17:41.990
They came with some
metadata already.

02:17:41.990 --> 02:17:43.510
They came with some titles.

02:17:43.510 --> 02:17:45.900
But that information
was often incomplete

02:17:45.900 --> 02:17:49.380
and sometimes incorrect,
because, you know, that's,

02:17:49.380 --> 02:17:50.680
that's the way it goes.

02:17:50.680 --> 02:17:54.320
And the couple of years I
spent in a radio station,

02:17:54.320 --> 02:17:56.120
sometimes the labels
weren't always as correct

02:17:56.120 --> 02:17:57.420
as they probably could be.

02:17:57.420 --> 02:18:01.430
So, I think we understood that.

02:18:01.430 --> 02:18:04.240
So, part of this collection

02:18:04.240 --> 02:18:07.520
and the impetus behind it
was the collecting forces

02:18:07.520 --> 02:18:11.420
of our human rights archive,
one of our collecting centers.

02:18:11.420 --> 02:18:14.390
Duke, the Rubenstein
Library at Duke,

02:18:14.390 --> 02:18:18.530
the Special Collections
Library, wants more and more

02:18:18.530 --> 02:18:20.630
to be seen an as
activists library.

02:18:20.630 --> 02:18:24.790
And this was really, really a
good example of a collection

02:18:24.790 --> 02:18:27.000
that we could sink
our teeth into.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:30.920
But it also came smack up
against the culture at Duke,

02:18:30.920 --> 02:18:34.730
which, you know, is a
traditional research center,

02:18:34.730 --> 02:18:37.820
American research library.

02:18:37.820 --> 02:18:39.120
It's very traditional.

02:18:39.120 --> 02:18:43.400
It wants to be an activist
library, but it also really hues

02:18:43.400 --> 02:18:45.820
to the lines of standards,
which is great.

02:18:45.820 --> 02:18:50.030
It really, we really use a
lot of what's called NPLP,

02:18:50.030 --> 02:18:52.620
which is more product,
less process

02:18:52.620 --> 02:18:55.050
in our, in our archiving.

02:18:55.050 --> 02:18:57.840
And so, the idea
of spending a lot

02:18:57.840 --> 02:19:00.070
of time doing item
level description

02:19:00.070 --> 02:19:05.400
on audio was not something that
I think a lot of the people sort

02:19:05.400 --> 02:19:09.190
in the leadership were
prepared for going forward.

02:19:09.190 --> 02:19:12.710
So, we had some challenges
early on there.

02:19:12.710 --> 02:19:18.650
And the, the needs of the
collection really sort

02:19:18.650 --> 02:19:21.150
of really brought those
challenges into relief.

02:19:21.150 --> 02:19:22.490
This was a collection

02:19:22.490 --> 02:19:26.420
that needed multilingual
description for accessibility.

02:19:26.420 --> 02:19:29.790
That meant that we had to have
playback of the entire file

02:19:29.790 --> 02:19:32.600
that we got back from
a cutting corporation,

02:19:32.600 --> 02:19:33.900
which was the company

02:19:33.900 --> 02:19:36.760
that digitized the tapes
and did a great job.

02:19:36.760 --> 02:19:39.940
And that was actually
the easy part for us.

02:19:39.940 --> 02:19:42.920
We needed an understanding
of the context

02:19:42.920 --> 02:19:44.600
of the audio's creation.

02:19:44.600 --> 02:19:50.950
And this was really important to
really make sensible metadata.

02:19:50.950 --> 02:19:54.610
And really most of
all an understanding

02:19:54.610 --> 02:19:58.620
of the absolute importance
of Haitian Creole as used

02:19:58.620 --> 02:20:03.030
by the station, because it was
revolutionary for its time.

02:20:03.030 --> 02:20:06.650
They were the first media outlet
in Haiti to use Haitian Creole,

02:20:06.650 --> 02:20:10.620
which was the language
of the people.

02:20:10.620 --> 02:20:17.270
And in processing the
collection and working with it,

02:20:17.270 --> 02:20:21.290
that is really more and
more has become, in my mind,

02:20:21.290 --> 02:20:23.320
the driving force
of the collection

02:20:23.320 --> 02:20:28.090
and its continued importance,
its political importance

02:20:28.090 --> 02:20:31.830
to the people of
Haiti, its importance

02:20:31.830 --> 02:20:34.280
as it was used by the station.

02:20:34.280 --> 02:20:37.010
The language that
the station used.

02:20:37.010 --> 02:20:38.570
The way they used the language.

02:20:38.570 --> 02:20:40.350
They went a long way
towards making parts

02:20:40.350 --> 02:20:42.370
of that language concrete.

02:20:42.370 --> 02:20:47.430
And so, really understanding the
collection is an understanding

02:20:47.430 --> 02:20:49.110
of Haitian Creole.

02:20:49.110 --> 02:20:51.380
So, that required
a lot of expertise,

02:20:51.380 --> 02:20:55.440
which we got very lucky and
were able to hire Laura Wagner

02:20:55.440 --> 02:20:58.760
to do the processing
of the collection.

02:20:58.760 --> 02:21:04.620
So, Laura sits and she listens
to audio and she describes it.

02:21:04.620 --> 02:21:08.830
And she bring to bear on that
audio a cultural expertise

02:21:08.830 --> 02:21:13.070
and cultural context
and history of Haiti

02:21:13.070 --> 02:21:14.630
that is really just outstanding.

02:21:14.630 --> 02:21:20.410
And there are a lot of
problems regarding especially

02:21:20.410 --> 02:21:22.640
authorities, controlled
vocabularies.

02:21:22.640 --> 02:21:26.230
LC headings don't really do
for these kinds of collections.

02:21:26.230 --> 02:21:29.710
LC headings are not
really tuned to.

02:21:29.710 --> 02:21:34.160
Or I should say that
maybe they have all that,

02:21:34.160 --> 02:21:38.200
they bring all the
cultural baggage of sort

02:21:38.200 --> 02:21:40.070
of mainstream America
with it, right?

02:21:40.070 --> 02:21:41.660
So, they don't really think

02:21:41.660 --> 02:21:45.430
about how place names might
be constructed in Haiti.

02:21:45.430 --> 02:21:48.490
They might not think about how
personal names are constructed

02:21:48.490 --> 02:21:49.790
in Haiti.

02:21:49.790 --> 02:21:53.670
They might not think about the
way that certain events happened

02:21:53.670 --> 02:21:55.270
or the way that certain
events happened might be

02:21:55.270 --> 02:21:58.850
through the lens of an
American imperialism.

02:21:58.850 --> 02:22:04.250
So, in processing the collection
and wanting to apply, you know,

02:22:04.250 --> 02:22:06.690
authorities and controlled
vocabularies

02:22:06.690 --> 02:22:09.820
so records could be searched
effectively across collections.

02:22:09.820 --> 02:22:12.440
It was a real challenge for us.

02:22:12.440 --> 02:22:17.390
And we do a lot of
basically local,

02:22:17.390 --> 02:22:22.940
local controlled vocabulary
in describing the collection.

02:22:22.940 --> 02:22:24.990
We have database issues with it.

02:22:24.990 --> 02:22:26.990
As a trilingual collection.

02:22:26.990 --> 02:22:30.930
Well, this actually goes
back to the importance

02:22:30.930 --> 02:22:34.110
of the Haitian Creole, but the.

02:22:34.110 --> 02:22:36.780
We started out just using a
relational database to try

02:22:36.780 --> 02:22:38.690
to wrangle everything together.

02:22:38.690 --> 02:22:41.930
But the problem with that was we
had difficulty copying records,

02:22:41.930 --> 02:22:43.230
which is really important

02:22:43.230 --> 02:22:48.360
when you're creating 51 hundred
records or 53 hundred records.

02:22:48.360 --> 02:22:52.490
And the other, the other issue
was that we needed to be able

02:22:52.490 --> 02:22:56.050
to get the information out
into a flat spreadsheet,

02:22:56.050 --> 02:22:58.030
which we weren't sure we could
do by the end of the project.

02:22:58.030 --> 02:22:59.470
So, we went ahead and
ported the database

02:22:59.470 --> 02:23:00.770
out to a flat spreadsheet.

02:23:00.770 --> 02:23:02.950
Well that spreadsheet
because the metadata has

02:23:02.950 --> 02:23:07.140
to be trilingual, has
over 100 fields in it.

02:23:07.140 --> 02:23:13.080
And to then ingest that into a
developing digital repository,

02:23:13.080 --> 02:23:16.710
has its own set of
complications.

02:23:16.710 --> 02:23:20.430
Amidst all of this, we have
to remain very flexible

02:23:20.430 --> 02:23:24.590
and very live in our approach to
how we process the collection.

02:23:24.590 --> 02:23:27.200
Laura, as brilliant as she
is, can't do it all on her own

02:23:27.200 --> 02:23:29.070
in the time that
we have to do it.

02:23:29.070 --> 02:23:32.260
So we have to try to find other
people with similar talents,

02:23:32.260 --> 02:23:35.060
the language skills, to
be able to help us on it.

02:23:35.060 --> 02:23:36.940
Well, you can imagine
that that population

02:23:36.940 --> 02:23:39.480
at Duke University
is fairly small.

02:23:39.480 --> 02:23:41.560
And we like to use
students when possible,

02:23:41.560 --> 02:23:43.360
because it keeps our costs down,

02:23:43.360 --> 02:23:45.260
it gives the students
experience.

02:23:45.260 --> 02:23:47.540
And in fact, we've
had some great success

02:23:47.540 --> 02:23:48.840
with some of our students.

02:23:48.840 --> 02:23:50.560
But students graduate.

02:23:50.560 --> 02:23:56.390
And so. And Duke has a hard time
hiring outside the university.

02:23:56.390 --> 02:23:59.200
We actually just got through
a whole process of trying

02:23:59.200 --> 02:24:02.270
to rehire a student
after she graduated,

02:24:02.270 --> 02:24:05.110
which set the project back
probably several months.

02:24:05.110 --> 02:24:07.210
We've just learned that we
can actually rehire her,

02:24:07.210 --> 02:24:09.990
but it took us four
months to do it.

02:24:09.990 --> 02:24:13.460
Duke is a large ship,
it's very powerful.

02:24:13.460 --> 02:24:14.760
It's well resourced.

02:24:14.760 --> 02:24:17.060
But it's very slow to turn.

02:24:17.060 --> 02:24:20.150
And so, we want, within
the archive, though,

02:24:20.150 --> 02:24:22.430
we want to make good on
that activists promise.

02:24:22.430 --> 02:24:25.040
And we want to be able to
say we can do these kinds

02:24:25.040 --> 02:24:26.910
of collections because
they're important.

02:24:26.910 --> 02:24:28.210
And they're.

02:24:28.210 --> 02:24:31.750
I told Michele Montas this
the other week when I saw her,

02:24:31.750 --> 02:24:33.560
as I had told her
before, that I really felt

02:24:33.560 --> 02:24:35.490
like this was the most
important collection I'll work

02:24:35.490 --> 02:24:37.930
on in my lifetime and my career.

02:24:37.930 --> 02:24:40.380
And I really truly believe that.

02:24:40.380 --> 02:24:42.620
And this is a collection where
I don't even understand the

02:24:42.620 --> 02:24:44.420
content when I listen to it.

02:24:44.420 --> 02:24:48.010
But the description is going
to make that more accessible

02:24:48.010 --> 02:24:51.110
to all of us in the end.

02:24:51.110 --> 02:24:52.580
And in our next steps, we hope

02:24:52.580 --> 02:24:57.000
that we can go beyond our
repository, which is very useful

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:58.630
if you're a researcher
in the U.S.,

02:24:58.630 --> 02:25:00.820
but is less so when
you're in Haiti.

02:25:00.820 --> 02:25:03.630
And we want to actually
digitally repatriate it,

02:25:03.630 --> 02:25:09.390
hopefully if we get our grant
fulfilled, using YouTube

02:25:09.390 --> 02:25:13.030
and the internet archive to go
where Haitians are in Haiti,

02:25:13.030 --> 02:25:15.360
because that's where they are.

02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:17.530
And to us, that's our,
that's our frontier.

02:25:17.530 --> 02:25:20.350
To push an academic library
to actually use that resource

02:25:20.350 --> 02:25:23.900
in such a way that it's
effective is really our

02:25:23.900 --> 02:25:25.200
next step.

02:25:25.200 --> 02:25:26.680
And luckily we have
the rights clearances

02:25:26.680 --> 02:25:27.980
to be able to do that.

02:25:27.980 --> 02:25:32.190
So. That's a thumbnail of
the work on Radio Haiti.

02:25:32.190 --> 02:25:33.990
&gt;&gt; Alejandra Bronfman:
Thank you.

02:25:33.990 --> 02:26:00.330
[ Applause ]

02:26:00.330 --> 02:26:01.630
&gt;&gt; Christine Heranadez: Thanks.

02:26:01.630 --> 02:26:05.450
Thank you very much, Alejandra,
for the invitation to talk

02:26:05.450 --> 02:26:07.120
with you, be on the panel.

02:26:07.120 --> 02:26:08.790
Thanks also to Josh Shepard

02:26:08.790 --> 02:26:10.670
and the Radio Preservation
Task Force

02:26:10.670 --> 02:26:12.400
for having their
conference this year.

02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:16.860
And giving us the opportunity
to speak with everyone.

02:26:16.860 --> 02:26:18.750
So, this morning I'm
going to talk a little bit

02:26:18.750 --> 02:26:23.220
about a collection that we
have in the Special Collections

02:26:23.220 --> 02:26:27.980
of a Latin American Library
at Tulane University.

02:26:27.980 --> 02:26:29.280
It's called the [foreign
language] collection

02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:32.310
of Cuban American Radionovelas.

02:26:32.310 --> 02:26:37.710
The collections measures
630 linear feet of material,

02:26:37.710 --> 02:26:41.280
the bulk of which
are audio tapes.

02:26:41.280 --> 02:26:46.350
And in fact, the collection
measures approximately,

02:26:46.350 --> 02:26:49.320
in terms of the audio
series its little

02:26:49.320 --> 02:26:52.260
under nine thousand
individual tapes.

02:26:52.260 --> 02:26:56.620
This is quarter inch polyester
audio tape on seven inch reels.

02:26:56.620 --> 02:26:58.910
And that's probably
represents close

02:26:58.910 --> 02:27:03.010
to three thousand 600
hours of audio recordings.

02:27:03.010 --> 02:27:06.740
The tapes actually, this,
they represent the library

02:27:06.740 --> 02:27:08.810
of radio program masters
that were produced

02:27:08.810 --> 02:27:12.370
by Americas Productions
Incorporated or API.

02:27:12.370 --> 02:27:16.320
This is a company that was
based out of Miami, Florida.

02:27:16.320 --> 02:27:20.690
It was founded in 1961
by [foreign language].

02:27:20.690 --> 02:27:24.800
Now, prior to, prior to
the 1959 Cuban Revolution,

02:27:24.800 --> 02:27:28.380
Cuba was a major producer
or radio programming,

02:27:28.380 --> 02:27:30.020
supplying as much
as a 75 percent

02:27:30.020 --> 02:27:32.140
of the canned radio programs
that were distributed

02:27:32.140 --> 02:27:34.330
to stations throughout
Latin America.

02:27:34.330 --> 02:27:38.570
That all, well that was
significantly impacted

02:27:38.570 --> 02:27:41.410
by the 59 revolution.

02:27:41.410 --> 02:27:44.420
And it also meant the
end to [inaudible] career

02:27:44.420 --> 02:27:48.660
as a public relations
man in Havana.

02:27:48.660 --> 02:27:52.510
So, after the revolution,
he resettled in Miami,

02:27:52.510 --> 02:27:54.680
as did much of the
talent that existed

02:27:54.680 --> 02:27:57.420
in Cuba prior to the revolution.

02:27:57.420 --> 02:28:00.970
The people who actually helped
to produce these radio programs.

02:28:00.970 --> 02:28:04.870
So the actors, the actresses,
directors, script writers,

02:28:04.870 --> 02:28:07.090
musicians, technicians.

02:28:07.090 --> 02:28:11.120
Many of these folks
resettled in Miami after 1959.

02:28:11.120 --> 02:28:13.600
And so, what [inaudible] was
able to do was actually fill

02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:17.900
that industry void for
programming production

02:28:17.900 --> 02:28:22.360
by founding API and by
making use of the talent

02:28:22.360 --> 02:28:26.600
that had pooled there
in Miami after 1959.

02:28:26.600 --> 02:28:33.050
Now, the company kind of began
its first couple years producing

02:28:33.050 --> 02:28:35.560
very pointed anticommunist
programs

02:28:35.560 --> 02:28:37.140
for the U.S. government,

02:28:37.140 --> 02:28:39.660
a number of which were
commissioned by Voice of America

02:28:39.660 --> 02:28:42.280
for broadcast back to Cuba.

02:28:42.280 --> 02:28:46.330
But, what [inaudible]
found was that he,

02:28:46.330 --> 02:28:48.880
in order to keep his
company commercially viable,

02:28:48.880 --> 02:28:52.200
he was going to have to
kind of shift the focus

02:28:52.200 --> 02:28:54.550
of the production of programs.

02:28:54.550 --> 02:28:58.090
And so, in 1963 he kind
of put the resources

02:28:58.090 --> 02:29:00.080
of the company towards
producing what he called

02:29:00.080 --> 02:29:01.460
pure entertainment.

02:29:01.460 --> 02:29:03.490
And so, this was going
to be programming

02:29:03.490 --> 02:29:07.350
that was more prodemocracy,
pro-capitalist in nature.

02:29:07.350 --> 02:29:11.710
Something that one of our
colleagues mentioned yesterday

02:29:11.710 --> 02:29:14.220
in one of the Cold
War sessions kind

02:29:14.220 --> 02:29:16.110
of propaganda as entertainment.

02:29:16.110 --> 02:29:18.210
And so, the idea was that
these would be programs

02:29:18.210 --> 02:29:20.790
that he could actually
license to stations

02:29:20.790 --> 02:29:23.000
and they would be able
to broadcast them,

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:24.300
because they weren't

02:29:24.300 --> 02:29:28.240
so outwardly obviously
anticommunist.

02:29:28.240 --> 02:29:33.700
But, these were, the programming
were primarily Radionovelas

02:29:33.700 --> 02:29:36.070
or radio dramas,
radio soap operas.

02:29:36.070 --> 02:29:38.510
But they also included
mystery and suspense shows.

02:29:38.510 --> 02:29:39.850
They did informationals.

02:29:39.850 --> 02:29:41.370
They did comedy programs.

02:29:41.370 --> 02:29:43.080
They did variety programs.

02:29:43.080 --> 02:29:44.570
So, there's a whole
range of programming

02:29:44.570 --> 02:29:47.200
that they were producing
in this short stretch

02:29:47.200 --> 02:29:50.220
between 1963 and 1970.

02:29:50.220 --> 02:29:51.890
And they licensed the programs

02:29:51.890 --> 02:29:54.450
to stations throughout
Latin America,

02:29:54.450 --> 02:29:56.110
but also more importantly

02:29:56.110 --> 02:29:59.200
to the burgeoning
Spanish speaking audiences

02:29:59.200 --> 02:30:04.020
in the United States and to
Spanish markets in Europe.

02:30:04.020 --> 02:30:06.960
So, they had a wide
distribution.

02:30:06.960 --> 02:30:09.340
But I'm not really here this
morning to talk to you all

02:30:09.340 --> 02:30:13.040
about the content
of this collection.

02:30:13.040 --> 02:30:15.570
What I really wanted to
talk with you is how that,

02:30:15.570 --> 02:30:18.500
how I and my colleagues
at Tulane are trying

02:30:18.500 --> 02:30:22.390
to put these programs back
on the air, so to speak.

02:30:22.390 --> 02:30:25.040
How to convert them and
make them accessible

02:30:25.040 --> 02:30:27.780
to the public again.

02:30:27.780 --> 02:30:33.350
And the collection came to
Tulane at the end of 2004.

02:30:33.350 --> 02:30:36.770
In 2005 the Latin American
Library had a graduate student

02:30:36.770 --> 02:30:40.870
who was working to do the rough
inventory of the materials.

02:30:40.870 --> 02:30:46.020
And she was able to dub a few
of the tapes onto CD's and do a,

02:30:46.020 --> 02:30:49.650
started to a condition
assessment of the tapes.

02:30:49.650 --> 02:30:54.550
But that all abruptly came to
an end with Hurricane Katrina.

02:30:54.550 --> 02:30:58.930
The playback equipment that
the library had was destroyed

02:30:58.930 --> 02:31:00.230
by the flooding.

02:31:00.230 --> 02:31:06.020
And so, for the intervening 10
years after that, the tapes,

02:31:06.020 --> 02:31:09.020
you know, the work
couldn't continue

02:31:09.020 --> 02:31:13.550
on that project until 2015.

02:31:13.550 --> 02:31:17.970
Then, the Latin American Library
was again in a position to kind

02:31:17.970 --> 02:31:20.100
of return to that project.

02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:23.450
Also, though, the parent
library, Howard Tilton,

02:31:23.450 --> 02:31:27.080
was also, had digital
capacity by that point.

02:31:27.080 --> 02:31:29.980
So, we had, my colleague
Jeff here.

02:31:29.980 --> 02:31:33.680
We had the Tulane University
Digital Library was in place.

02:31:33.680 --> 02:31:36.460
And so, we actually had more
digital capacity to kind

02:31:36.460 --> 02:31:38.320
of come back to this project.

02:31:38.320 --> 02:31:40.570
So, was this the right moment?

02:31:40.570 --> 02:31:44.620
So, in order to begin in
2015 the first thing we had

02:31:44.620 --> 02:31:49.110
to do was establish
the copyright status.

02:31:49.110 --> 02:31:51.010
These were tapes that
were produced in kind

02:31:51.010 --> 02:31:53.110
of the donut hole of copyright.

02:31:53.110 --> 02:31:56.740
Apart from the donor agreement,
I didn't have any documentation

02:31:56.740 --> 02:32:00.350
about the multiple
different rights holders

02:32:00.350 --> 02:32:01.650
that might have been involved

02:32:01.650 --> 02:32:03.860
in the production
of these programs.

02:32:03.860 --> 02:32:05.960
And we really needed to be
sure that if we're going

02:32:05.960 --> 02:32:09.300
to digitize these
materials and put them online

02:32:09.300 --> 02:32:11.400
and make them open
access available

02:32:11.400 --> 02:32:13.410
that we were not going
to have any issues.

02:32:13.410 --> 02:32:17.040
So, it took eight months
working with Tulane's Office

02:32:17.040 --> 02:32:21.230
of the General Council and
with other professionals

02:32:21.230 --> 02:32:24.450
in the field, like James Hurtle
and Elizabeth Townsend Gard,

02:32:24.450 --> 02:32:26.370
from Tulane's Law School,

02:32:26.370 --> 02:32:30.870
to actually get our
copyrights information in order.

02:32:30.870 --> 02:32:32.930
We were ready to go ahead.

02:32:32.930 --> 02:32:38.490
So, the next step was to
then devise a pilot project.

02:32:38.490 --> 02:32:42.710
I don't have a background
in audio preservation

02:32:42.710 --> 02:32:45.710
and nor have we any
kind of workflow to deal

02:32:45.710 --> 02:32:50.560
with the conversion of
analogs to digital recordings.

02:32:50.560 --> 02:32:52.800
So, the purpose of
the pilot project was

02:32:52.800 --> 02:32:54.100
to kind of learn that.

02:32:54.100 --> 02:32:57.070
And what we did was we, I
made a selection of tapes.

02:32:57.070 --> 02:33:00.900
I knew we had some condition
issues to think about.

02:33:00.900 --> 02:33:03.230
We had. We knew that
there was some mold.

02:33:03.230 --> 02:33:05.950
We knew that there are a number
of poor packed conditions.

02:33:05.950 --> 02:33:08.520
And so, the point of the
pilot project really was just

02:33:08.520 --> 02:33:10.940
to figure out how much
was it going to cost

02:33:10.940 --> 02:33:13.700
to convert these tapes.

02:33:13.700 --> 02:33:16.200
How much was it, what
were the workflows?

02:33:16.200 --> 02:33:17.770
How much labor were
we going to need

02:33:17.770 --> 02:33:20.710
to manage the digital
files, create the metadata?

02:33:20.710 --> 02:33:23.420
And then build a
digital collection,

02:33:23.420 --> 02:33:27.680
because that was going to be
the outlet for providing access.

02:33:27.680 --> 02:33:34.320
To fund this little
project, I looked to a group.

02:33:34.320 --> 02:33:39.050
Tulane is a member of the
Center for Research Libraries

02:33:39.050 --> 02:33:40.350
and under the Center

02:33:40.350 --> 02:33:42.280
for Research Libraries
there is a project

02:33:42.280 --> 02:33:44.420
that is called the
Latin American Research

02:33:44.420 --> 02:33:46.380
Resources Project.

02:33:46.380 --> 02:33:50.900
And the member institutions to
CLR part of their subscription,

02:33:50.900 --> 02:33:54.690
their yearly subscription
moneys are pooled and the LARP,

02:33:54.690 --> 02:33:57.030
which is the name, the
acronym for this group.

02:33:57.030 --> 02:34:00.780
LARP can then fund some small
digitization initiatives

02:34:00.780 --> 02:34:03.770
for the member institutions.

02:34:03.770 --> 02:34:06.740
So, we were fortunate
to get a little

02:34:06.740 --> 02:34:09.720
over eight thousand dollars
to do that pilot project.

02:34:09.720 --> 02:34:11.140
We worked with George
Blood Audio

02:34:11.140 --> 02:34:13.880
to help us with conversion.

02:34:13.880 --> 02:34:18.760
And we were able to
actually do 194 tapes.

02:34:18.760 --> 02:34:25.920
So by the end of 2016 we
had our 194 tapes digitized.

02:34:25.920 --> 02:34:29.190
Actually, they had some
conservation done on them.

02:34:29.190 --> 02:34:30.740
They were digitized.

02:34:30.740 --> 02:34:33.990
We created the metadata and
we were able to get them up,

02:34:33.990 --> 02:34:36.770
get a digital collection

02:34:36.770 --> 02:34:41.180
up in the Tulane
University Digital Library.

02:34:41.180 --> 02:34:42.480
We also at that time were able

02:34:42.480 --> 02:34:45.640
to complete a condition
assessment

02:34:45.640 --> 02:34:49.250
of a four percent sample of the
total number of audio tapes.

02:34:49.250 --> 02:34:52.520
So, we had a good idea of what
our conditioning issues were.

02:34:52.520 --> 02:34:57.560
And now know approximately
how much, in terms of funding

02:34:57.560 --> 02:34:59.370
and labor resources it's going

02:34:59.370 --> 02:35:02.510
to take convert the
entire library

02:35:02.510 --> 02:35:06.680
of eight thousand
900 and some tapes.

02:35:06.680 --> 02:35:10.740
So, let me show you.

02:35:10.740 --> 02:35:15.550
It kind of went ahead of my.

02:35:15.550 --> 02:35:19.050
There's the homepage for
the digital collection.

02:35:19.050 --> 02:35:21.110
We have eight titles up there.

02:35:21.110 --> 02:35:22.510
Three of them in their entirety.

02:35:22.510 --> 02:35:25.140
So, we have all the
episodes for the stories,

02:35:25.140 --> 02:35:29.790
have a good sampling
of some of the content.

02:35:29.790 --> 02:35:34.150
And we'll show you in a minute
what the metadata looks like.

02:35:34.150 --> 02:35:37.510
Metadata is done both
in English and Spanish.

02:35:37.510 --> 02:35:43.450
And so, now in 2017, what
we're able to continue

02:35:43.450 --> 02:35:47.350
to do is now we have that
experience and the knowledge to,

02:35:47.350 --> 02:35:51.380
you know, to pursue some larger
grant funding opportunities

02:35:51.380 --> 02:35:53.500
to keep going with
the conversion.

02:35:53.500 --> 02:35:56.200
And at the moment, we're
currently proceeding

02:35:56.200 --> 02:35:59.120
with doing kind of mold
remediation and cleaning

02:35:59.120 --> 02:36:03.390
of the tapes, kind of to be
ready for when we might be able

02:36:03.390 --> 02:36:06.020
to continue with conversion.

02:36:06.020 --> 02:36:08.690
Approximately one third
of the total collection

02:36:08.690 --> 02:36:11.070
of tapes has some
condition issues.

02:36:11.070 --> 02:36:13.770
So, we're just going to
continue with that work.

02:36:13.770 --> 02:36:17.490
So, with that, I'm going to hand
the podium over to my colleague,

02:36:17.490 --> 02:36:20.260
Jeff Rubin, who's going to tell
you a little bit more about some

02:36:20.260 --> 02:36:23.340
of the cool stuff that's
happening on that end.

02:36:23.340 --> 02:36:25.170
Okay, Jeff.

02:36:25.170 --> 02:36:26.620
&gt;&gt; Jeff Rubin: Should
I come up there?

02:36:26.620 --> 02:36:28.420
&gt;&gt; Christine Heranadez:
If you'd like

02:36:28.420 --> 02:36:34.320
[ Applause ]

02:36:34.320 --> 02:36:36.290
&gt;&gt; Jeff Rubin: Well,
thank you everyone.

02:36:36.290 --> 02:36:41.930
The. I'm not sure
where I'm going here.

02:36:46.370 --> 02:36:52.940
So the collection, the
process actually we, what I.

02:36:52.940 --> 02:36:58.500
The part of the library
that I oversee is the sort

02:36:58.500 --> 02:37:01.870
of production and
access component

02:37:01.870 --> 02:37:04.480
of our collections and how we.

02:37:04.480 --> 02:37:10.890
We have a platform that provides
basically open access to all

02:37:10.890 --> 02:37:13.790
of our collection materials
that were digitized.

02:37:13.790 --> 02:37:18.340
This. once we got into
the position to be able

02:37:18.340 --> 02:37:23.270
to distribute these materials
to make them available to anyone

02:37:23.270 --> 02:37:29.320
who wants to read them or
to listen to them, we had,

02:37:29.320 --> 02:37:34.440
we had sort of part of
the process figured out.

02:37:34.440 --> 02:37:44.900
The. The difficulty, though, is
that our proposal to go forward

02:37:44.900 --> 02:37:51.720
to have these tapes
digitized was,

02:37:51.720 --> 02:37:57.070
the cost of that portion
didn't cover the cost

02:37:57.070 --> 02:38:01.410
of this initial cleaning and
conservation of the tapes.

02:38:01.410 --> 02:38:06.730
So, that is what we're
having to do in house

02:38:06.730 --> 02:38:14.490
and through Chris's students.

02:38:14.490 --> 02:38:20.160
Here's a slide of our student
worker, Rebecca, vacuuming

02:38:20.160 --> 02:38:23.280
and cleaning the
reels in the boxes

02:38:23.280 --> 02:38:28.130
of each of these audio tapes.

02:38:28.130 --> 02:38:34.890
What we ended up coming across
was that each tape was going

02:38:34.890 --> 02:38:41.370
to require somebody manually
sort of cleaning the tape

02:38:41.370 --> 02:38:45.520
for the entire, you know,
one to one real time running

02:38:45.520 --> 02:38:50.330
of each tape, which is a
horrible job for somebody

02:38:50.330 --> 02:38:52.250
and especially for a student.

02:38:52.250 --> 02:38:56.830
So, what. We had
this serendipitous.

02:38:56.830 --> 02:38:59.210
This meeting that
Chris had with one

02:38:59.210 --> 02:39:01.320
of our new faculty at Tulane.

02:39:01.320 --> 02:39:05.870
His name is Philippe Cruz
and he is a Brazilian

02:39:05.870 --> 02:39:11.610
and he is a Brazilian historian,
a historian of Brazil.

02:39:11.610 --> 02:39:15.020
And Chris had a meeting
with him and it turns

02:39:15.020 --> 02:39:17.800
out he was very interested
in Tulane's Maker Space.

02:39:17.800 --> 02:39:22.250
Tulane has a new
3D printing space

02:39:22.250 --> 02:39:24.570
and with lots of equipment.

02:39:24.570 --> 02:39:26.590
Let me show you this.

02:39:26.590 --> 02:39:29.200
And we thought.

02:39:29.200 --> 02:39:32.400
We were trying to figure out
how can we take the manual labor

02:39:32.400 --> 02:39:38.520
out of cleaning these, these
tapes and just have them run

02:39:38.520 --> 02:39:42.380
and Philippe and Chris and
I were talking and we came

02:39:42.380 --> 02:39:52.690
up with this idea to 3D print an
extra reel, a set of, kind of,

02:39:52.690 --> 02:39:59.810
these, I don't, these reels
that tape goes over and under

02:39:59.810 --> 02:40:03.220
and cleans the tape without
having a student to having

02:40:03.220 --> 02:40:06.480
to sort of hold the
clothe and do it manually.

02:40:06.480 --> 02:40:10.630
So we.

02:40:10.630 --> 02:40:13.370
Philippe, he knew how
to do this already.

02:40:13.370 --> 02:40:15.560
And he sort of just jumped in.

02:40:15.560 --> 02:40:19.760
and wanted to, to design
and build and print

02:40:19.760 --> 02:40:21.710
out this little gadget.

02:40:21.710 --> 02:40:24.240
And you have, that's
not even a gadget.

02:40:24.240 --> 02:40:25.540
It's a widget really.

02:40:25.540 --> 02:40:31.030
It's just a piece of solid
plastic that printed out.

02:40:31.030 --> 02:40:34.740
And this Maker Space is open to
people on the campus for free.

02:40:34.740 --> 02:40:38.880
You can just go in and get sort

02:40:38.880 --> 02:40:43.310
of quickly certified
to run the equipment.

02:40:43.310 --> 02:40:44.610
Send files in.

02:40:44.610 --> 02:40:48.300
what we came up with
was, was this.

02:40:48.300 --> 02:40:52.640
And so, there's a, a video
here that I will play.

02:40:52.640 --> 02:40:56.600
If I can find that
presentation load.

02:41:05.090 --> 02:41:07.980
It has stopped working.

02:41:07.980 --> 02:41:09.580
Let's see if I can.

02:41:09.580 --> 02:41:12.550
Let's get this back up.

02:41:12.550 --> 02:41:18.140
Did we have them up here?

02:41:18.140 --> 02:41:19.440
We didn't.

02:41:19.440 --> 02:41:22.400
Let me open this real quick.

02:41:22.400 --> 02:41:29.520
So, the, the video
it just shows.

02:41:29.520 --> 02:41:31.820
This is it, huh.

02:41:42.650 --> 02:41:43.950
There we go.

02:41:43.950 --> 02:41:45.950
And if we can slide show.

02:41:45.950 --> 02:41:49.850
And play.

02:41:53.510 --> 02:41:59.720
[ Inaudible ]

02:41:59.720 --> 02:42:01.020
There we go.

02:42:01.020 --> 02:42:03.320
Let's see if.

02:42:22.190 --> 02:42:26.630
So, we sort of had this
printed and kind of attached it

02:42:26.630 --> 02:42:29.440
to the side of the
machine and it runs over.

02:42:29.440 --> 02:42:33.590
There's no tension really
being applied to the tape.

02:42:33.590 --> 02:42:37.240
But it sort of gently goes
over these cleaning materials

02:42:37.240 --> 02:42:44.650
and takes off sort of the layer
of, of dust and sort of some

02:42:44.650 --> 02:42:49.910
of the loose iron
oxide bits on the tape.

02:42:49.910 --> 02:42:53.510
Let's get back to.

02:42:53.510 --> 02:43:00.680
[ Inaudible ]

02:43:00.680 --> 02:43:01.980
Yeah, we'll do this.

02:43:01.980 --> 02:43:05.710
So, the other part of it.

02:43:05.710 --> 02:43:09.480
So, now we have this other
collaborator with us, this,

02:43:09.480 --> 02:43:14.760
Philippe, who it turned out
to be just perfectly timed

02:43:14.760 --> 02:43:16.910
to fall right into our laps.

02:43:16.910 --> 02:43:20.040
We couldn't have
planned it any better.

02:43:20.040 --> 02:43:22.790
That is going on now.

02:43:22.790 --> 02:43:28.050
And the. So, Craig is
doing three languages.

02:43:28.050 --> 02:43:29.420
We're only doing two.

02:43:29.420 --> 02:43:32.870
But the work of doing Spanish

02:43:32.870 --> 02:43:38.110
and English metadata
is very time consuming.

02:43:38.110 --> 02:43:40.620
We are having all
of the metadata

02:43:40.620 --> 02:43:42.740
in both of these languages.

02:43:42.740 --> 02:43:46.180
But we're also needing people
to, to look at the content,

02:43:46.180 --> 02:43:52.670
to listen to the content and
describe that information.

02:43:52.670 --> 02:43:54.690
So, when we should find

02:43:54.690 --> 02:44:00.350
out in late December whether
we get funding to do the,

02:44:00.350 --> 02:44:10.300
that initial third of all
of these tapes for, to do.

02:44:10.300 --> 02:44:13.270
And this is.

02:44:13.270 --> 02:44:14.750
So, this is.

02:44:14.750 --> 02:44:16.890
We've done another
radio project at Tulane.

02:44:16.890 --> 02:44:20.680
We did a project for the WTUL,

02:44:20.680 --> 02:44:25.050
which is the Tulane University
independent radio station.

02:44:25.050 --> 02:44:27.980
We have an archive
of those materials.

02:44:27.980 --> 02:44:32.230
The only other audio project I
have ever done was another radio

02:44:32.230 --> 02:44:36.010
broadcast, but this was a
broadcast of jazz radio programs

02:44:36.010 --> 02:44:37.970
from the New Orleans Jazz Club.

02:44:37.970 --> 02:44:41.710
And I did this when I was
Louisiana State Museum,

02:44:41.710 --> 02:44:45.560
where I spent the first
20 years of my career.

02:44:45.560 --> 02:44:48.330
So, the main difference between.

02:44:48.330 --> 02:44:51.080
That was about eight
years ago that project.

02:44:51.080 --> 02:44:52.380
And this project.

02:44:52.380 --> 02:44:53.910
The difference between then

02:44:53.910 --> 02:44:57.600
and now is the equipment is
no longer available to buy.

02:44:57.600 --> 02:45:00.720
Reel to reel decks are
few and far between.

02:45:00.720 --> 02:45:05.420
There are very few
makers of, manufacturers

02:45:05.420 --> 02:45:07.100
of reel to reel decks.

02:45:07.100 --> 02:45:10.900
The ones that are, are doing
very high end, you know,

02:45:10.900 --> 02:45:13.850
10 thousand dollar
and up machines.

02:45:13.850 --> 02:45:18.720
So, we had to go
and find a deck on,

02:45:18.720 --> 02:45:22.460
through a third party
company that goes

02:45:22.460 --> 02:45:23.880
and this is their passion.

02:45:23.880 --> 02:45:27.980
They go and they rebuilt
reel to reel decks.

02:45:27.980 --> 02:45:29.630
And currently we have one.

02:45:29.630 --> 02:45:31.300
And what we need
to do is we need

02:45:31.300 --> 02:45:34.350
to find two, three, four more.

02:45:34.350 --> 02:45:37.410
So that we can have this
sort of assembly line

02:45:37.410 --> 02:45:41.890
of tapes going at the same time.

02:45:41.890 --> 02:45:45.570
And so, yeah my expertise in
this is not in the content

02:45:45.570 --> 02:45:52.440
at all, but is really in
facilitation of the sort

02:45:52.440 --> 02:45:55.550
of analog to digital and then
the publishing of this material.

02:45:55.550 --> 02:45:59.370
And so, once we are done, all of
this material will open access

02:45:59.370 --> 02:46:01.620
and available to everybody.

02:46:01.620 --> 02:46:03.670
And then, the key that
we're trying to find

02:46:03.670 --> 02:46:05.720
out is how is this
material going to be used.

02:46:05.720 --> 02:46:10.380
How do we, how do we add
knowledge, how do we find people

02:46:10.380 --> 02:46:13.870
to use this material,
add knowledge to it

02:46:13.870 --> 02:46:17.230
so it just doesn't become
something sitting on a shelf

02:46:17.230 --> 02:46:20.000
that someone can listen
to, but how is it going

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:21.300
to be used in classroom?

02:46:21.300 --> 02:46:27.970
How can it be used for the study
of various cultural aspects

02:46:27.970 --> 02:46:30.370
of history or economic
aspects of it?

02:46:30.370 --> 02:46:33.440
And how do we get that into
the classroom, whether it's K

02:46:33.440 --> 02:46:38.010
through 12 or, you
know, higher education.

02:46:38.010 --> 02:46:42.140
So, that's what we're looking
at and trying to sort of figure

02:46:42.140 --> 02:46:47.390
out is hopefully we can get
these materials used, you know,

02:46:47.390 --> 02:46:49.720
and become a resource
for others.

02:46:49.720 --> 02:46:52.910
So. That's what we have.

02:46:52.910 --> 02:46:54.210
&gt;&gt; Alejandra Bronfman: Great.

02:46:54.210 --> 02:46:55.510
Thank you.

02:46:58.110 --> 02:46:59.410
&gt;&gt; Alejandra Bronfman:
Okay, so I'm going

02:46:59.410 --> 02:47:00.710
to hand it over to Robert now.

02:47:00.710 --> 02:47:03.590
And then, Ayanna, if you want
to say a few things after Robert

02:47:03.590 --> 02:47:05.550
that would be great or not.

02:47:05.550 --> 02:47:06.850
Okay.

02:47:06.850 --> 02:47:08.620
&gt;&gt; Antonio Pereira:
Great, thank you very much.

02:47:08.620 --> 02:47:11.400
Let me echo, I'll start
by echoing what a lot

02:47:11.400 --> 02:47:13.410
of people have said is
first thanks to Josh Shepard

02:47:13.410 --> 02:47:17.450
for putting together this
extraordinary conference.

02:47:17.450 --> 02:47:20.100
And echo as well what I
think people have said

02:47:20.100 --> 02:47:22.860
about what makes it
extraordinary is that it crosses

02:47:22.860 --> 02:47:24.480
so many different boundaries.

02:47:24.480 --> 02:47:26.120
I mean, we've brought
together scholars.

02:47:26.120 --> 02:47:29.600
We've brought together people
in the IT world, archives world,

02:47:29.600 --> 02:47:34.030
communities, creators of
content, users of content.

02:47:34.030 --> 02:47:35.850
And that's unique in many ways.

02:47:35.850 --> 02:47:37.150
I think most of us,

02:47:37.150 --> 02:47:40.550
you generally just meet amongst
ourselves and talk to ourselves.

02:47:40.550 --> 02:47:42.020
Well, I certainly
talk to myself.

02:47:42.020 --> 02:47:45.050
But I meant talk
amongst ourselves.

02:47:45.050 --> 02:47:47.970
But I think what we're
also experiencing

02:47:47.970 --> 02:47:51.030
and certainly something that
we need to address is the fact

02:47:51.030 --> 02:47:53.560
that we all speak
different languages as well.

02:47:53.560 --> 02:47:58.250
And the point I would
make after having listened

02:47:58.250 --> 02:47:59.860
to the conversations
over the past few days

02:47:59.860 --> 02:48:02.910
and certainly this
session as well is that.

02:48:02.910 --> 02:48:06.120
And I'll borrow these
terms with all apologies

02:48:06.120 --> 02:48:10.090
from Marx's capital is that the
researchers in the communities,

02:48:10.090 --> 02:48:14.000
a lot of the users of the
content speak about use value.

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:15.870
When they look at a
collection, they'll talk

02:48:15.870 --> 02:48:17.650
about this would be
great for a class.

02:48:17.650 --> 02:48:19.700
It's essential for my research.

02:48:19.700 --> 02:48:22.100
This tells a story
of a community.

02:48:22.100 --> 02:48:26.370
And I think archivists and
especially those archivists

02:48:26.370 --> 02:48:30.680
like I, who are managers
of archives,

02:48:30.680 --> 02:48:32.450
talk in terms of exchange value.

02:48:32.450 --> 02:48:35.590
This is, collection is one
opportunity among many.

02:48:35.590 --> 02:48:38.420
And I look at it and evaluate
it in terms of resources

02:48:38.420 --> 02:48:45.580
and capacity and, and priorities
that how do I, how am I going

02:48:45.580 --> 02:48:47.180
to deal with the
challenges of mold.

02:48:47.180 --> 02:48:48.930
How am I going to deal with
process of description?

02:48:48.930 --> 02:48:51.780
How am I going to, when
I have a limited budget.

02:48:51.780 --> 02:48:54.490
And the Smithsonian has a
relatively large budget,

02:48:54.490 --> 02:48:55.790
but it's going.

02:48:55.790 --> 02:48:59.920
I mean all of us are
increasingly looking to deal

02:48:59.920 --> 02:49:01.220
with the fact that our,

02:49:01.220 --> 02:49:03.940
in the cultural heritage
world our budgets are moving

02:49:03.940 --> 02:49:07.220
from a program based to a
project based foundation,

02:49:07.220 --> 02:49:09.280
meaning that for
example the Smithsonian,

02:49:09.280 --> 02:49:11.030
the Federal Government
pays essentially

02:49:11.030 --> 02:49:12.480
for buildings and staff.

02:49:12.480 --> 02:49:16.400
Everything else has
to be raised.

02:49:16.400 --> 02:49:17.700
Funds have to be raised.

02:49:17.700 --> 02:49:20.090
And I think that's true as you
listen to everyone talking today

02:49:20.090 --> 02:49:24.000
about these projects
are all grand funded.

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:26.310
When those grants go
away, what happens?

02:49:26.310 --> 02:49:28.310
Increasingly, we're
putting things together

02:49:28.310 --> 02:49:33.590
in this ad hock one
project to another hoping

02:49:33.590 --> 02:49:36.020
that it'll all come magically
together at some point

02:49:36.020 --> 02:49:39.960
and things will be preserved
and we'll make it all work.

02:49:39.960 --> 02:49:42.160
That's a tremendous challenge.

02:49:42.160 --> 02:49:45.490
And I think everyone's kind
of underscored the fact

02:49:45.490 --> 02:49:49.040
that the answer to that is
going to be collaboration.

02:49:49.040 --> 02:49:52.240
But, I would add a couple
of different things.

02:49:52.240 --> 02:49:57.120
One -- I think of,
how should I put this?

02:49:57.120 --> 02:50:00.750
I think collecting is
always the easy part.

02:50:00.750 --> 02:50:04.760
And that the collecting really
needs to be addressed in terms

02:50:04.760 --> 02:50:08.980
of a continuum of care
that there is collecting.

02:50:08.980 --> 02:50:10.560
And that's just the start.

02:50:10.560 --> 02:50:12.500
There's processing.

02:50:12.500 --> 02:50:13.800
There's description.

02:50:13.800 --> 02:50:15.230
There's providing access.

02:50:15.230 --> 02:50:16.530
There's preservation.

02:50:16.530 --> 02:50:17.830
A

02:50:17.830 --> 02:50:19.130
And in a digital world,
preservation is an ongoing,

02:50:19.130 --> 02:50:21.490
it's really an interminable
project, right?

02:50:21.490 --> 02:50:23.470
The technology is
going to change.

02:50:23.470 --> 02:50:26.110
So, I would urge everyone
who is creating content

02:50:26.110 --> 02:50:30.410
or collecting content to
think of a collaboration

02:50:30.410 --> 02:50:32.490
within archives, not
in terms of a handoff.

02:50:32.490 --> 02:50:34.510
Okay, now it's your problem.

02:50:34.510 --> 02:50:36.900
But how do you start right
from the beginning to think

02:50:36.900 --> 02:50:39.240
about that entire
continuum of care.

02:50:39.240 --> 02:50:43.840
And realize that in many ways
that the point of acquisition

02:50:43.840 --> 02:50:46.130
by an archivists is the point
where you get the best chance

02:50:46.130 --> 02:50:48.690
of raising the money to
deal with that collection.

02:50:48.690 --> 02:50:51.570
That very often, you know,
if you give something

02:50:51.570 --> 02:50:54.510
to an archives, it is going
to go into the back of a room.

02:50:54.510 --> 02:50:55.840
It is going to be
stowed on a shelf.

02:50:55.840 --> 02:50:58.140
It is not going to be
addressed because a whole bunch

02:50:58.140 --> 02:51:00.370
of other collections are
coming in at the same time.

02:51:00.370 --> 02:51:04.460
so, I think, you know,
understanding how we might look

02:51:04.460 --> 02:51:07.990
to sharing responsibilities at
an earlier and earlier point

02:51:07.990 --> 02:51:10.100
in a continuum or a lifecycle

02:51:10.100 --> 02:51:12.110
of a collection is
really important.

02:51:12.110 --> 02:51:14.270
The other thing I would
say from the perspective

02:51:14.270 --> 02:51:17.370
of the archives is that we
have to start thinking in terms

02:51:17.370 --> 02:51:23.000
of beyond the boundaries of
the four walls of our archives.

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.180
I mean, we have traditionally
thought that everything happens

02:51:25.180 --> 02:51:26.480
and this is certainly
true of the Museum

02:51:26.480 --> 02:51:28.320
of American History
and the Smithsonian.

02:51:28.320 --> 02:51:29.720
Everything happens
in that building.

02:51:29.720 --> 02:51:31.020
We collect it.

02:51:31.020 --> 02:51:32.320
We take care of it.

02:51:32.320 --> 02:51:33.620
We describe it.

02:51:33.620 --> 02:51:34.920
We interpret it.

02:51:34.920 --> 02:51:36.220
We assign meaning to these
content, to this content.

02:51:36.220 --> 02:51:39.860
And increasingly that's
not atenable proposition

02:51:39.860 --> 02:51:41.160
for all sorts of reasons.

02:51:41.160 --> 02:51:45.710
Not simply because of the budget
problems, which, you know,

02:51:45.710 --> 02:51:48.620
plague me, but also, and
the idea that, you know,

02:51:48.620 --> 02:51:50.460
we're not just sharing
information now,

02:51:50.460 --> 02:51:52.580
we're really sharing authority.

02:51:52.580 --> 02:51:55.510
It is not the role of the
Smithsonian or the Museum

02:51:55.510 --> 02:51:58.180
of American History to
interpret a collection.

02:51:58.180 --> 02:52:00.100
We want to be able to make
that collection available

02:52:00.100 --> 02:52:01.750
for other people to
interpret and other people

02:52:01.750 --> 02:52:03.510
to tell us what it means.

02:52:03.510 --> 02:52:09.010
So, looking for collaborations
that involve, I think,

02:52:09.010 --> 02:52:14.470
on one hand on the financial
scale, scale, or dealing with,

02:52:14.470 --> 02:52:16.070
or financial [inaudible]
dealing with scale.

02:52:16.070 --> 02:52:18.680
You know, not treating
problems or collections

02:52:18.680 --> 02:52:21.580
as a boutique effort that
we're going to address once

02:52:21.580 --> 02:52:22.880
and somehow raise the money.

02:52:22.880 --> 02:52:26.920
But looking for ways to share
infrastructure and enable to us

02:52:26.920 --> 02:52:28.860
to drive down the costs.

02:52:28.860 --> 02:52:31.810
Because everything you guys
have said was kind of staggering

02:52:31.810 --> 02:52:34.520
in terms of the manual
labor involved.

02:52:34.520 --> 02:52:37.100
I mean, tape by tape by tape.

02:52:37.100 --> 02:52:38.900
That's a huge cost.

02:52:38.900 --> 02:52:40.470
So, how do you address that?

02:52:40.470 --> 02:52:42.260
It's not going to
happen in one institution

02:52:42.260 --> 02:52:43.560
and then another institution

02:52:43.560 --> 02:52:46.200
and another institution all
duplicating efforts competing

02:52:46.200 --> 02:52:49.520
for the same funds, building
the same kind of infrastructure.

02:52:49.520 --> 02:52:51.660
So, those collaborations
are essential.

02:52:51.660 --> 02:52:53.500
The other thing I
would say in terms of.

02:52:53.500 --> 02:52:55.810
And that has to be driven by
the archivists and the museums

02:52:55.810 --> 02:52:57.290
and the culture of
heritage institutions.

02:52:57.290 --> 02:52:59.210
The other thing I
would say is, you know,

02:52:59.210 --> 02:53:03.600
essentially that we can,
you know, take advantage

02:53:03.600 --> 02:53:07.020
of technology in the sense
that a lot of the activities

02:53:07.020 --> 02:53:09.430
that have traditionally
been seen as archivally,

02:53:09.430 --> 02:53:12.820
archival those functions
can be shared.

02:53:12.820 --> 02:53:14.610
And should be shared,
especially in terms

02:53:14.610 --> 02:53:16.210
of description and
interpretation.

02:53:16.210 --> 02:53:19.530
There was a wonderful session on
metadata yesterday, which talked

02:53:19.530 --> 02:53:22.820
about the whole number of
different ways you can collect

02:53:22.820 --> 02:53:24.380
and aggregate metadata.

02:53:24.380 --> 02:53:28.730
And a lot of them were not
being done by the archivists.

02:53:28.730 --> 02:53:31.210
There's Google Forums,
there's aggregation.

02:53:31.210 --> 02:53:35.230
There's a wonderful project out
of Washington State run by one

02:53:35.230 --> 02:53:40.580
of my heros, Kim Withee
Macutu [assumed spelling],

02:53:40.580 --> 02:53:44.170
which is essentially a
collections management system

02:53:44.170 --> 02:53:47.370
that allows indigenous
peoples to assign values

02:53:47.370 --> 02:53:51.180
and descriptions, definitions to
content that other people hold.

02:53:51.180 --> 02:53:55.010
And the variant to that is what
something also Kim has worked

02:53:55.010 --> 02:53:56.960
on is traditional
knowledge labels,

02:53:56.960 --> 02:54:00.850
where you can essentially if
you open up your catalogue

02:54:00.850 --> 02:54:05.490
as in archives, someone else can
assign content to it as well,

02:54:05.490 --> 02:54:07.630
interpretations and metadata.

02:54:07.630 --> 02:54:10.090
And so, there's a whole
variety of technology,

02:54:10.090 --> 02:54:13.120
technological options that we
should be actively exploring.

02:54:13.120 --> 02:54:14.950
But they're going to start on
the premises that we're going

02:54:14.950 --> 02:54:17.500
to give up some of our custodial
role, we're going to give

02:54:17.500 --> 02:54:21.180
up some of our traditional
roles and responsibilities

02:54:21.180 --> 02:54:23.450
and we've just got to
share, not just information,

02:54:23.450 --> 02:54:25.900
which is what we've always
tried to do, but share authority

02:54:25.900 --> 02:54:27.800
and more importantly
share control.

02:54:27.800 --> 02:54:30.410
So, I think there are a variety
of things we could tease out.

02:54:30.410 --> 02:54:34.130
But I mean, the larger
point I was going

02:54:34.130 --> 02:54:35.810
to make is it's not going
to happen in one collection

02:54:35.810 --> 02:54:40.790
at a time, because we simply
cannot manage the costs

02:54:40.790 --> 02:54:44.350
when we look at things
like that.

02:54:44.350 --> 02:54:46.150
&gt;&gt; Alejandra Bronfman:
Thank you.

02:54:46.150 --> 02:54:49.750
[ Applause ]

02:54:49.750 --> 02:54:52.460
Okay. So, at this point, I don't
know if Ayanna you want to,

02:54:52.460 --> 02:54:54.290
if Ayanna you want
to say anything?

02:54:54.290 --> 02:54:57.010
Ayanna is trying to find
a home for a collection

02:54:57.010 --> 02:54:58.310
of how many tapes is it?

02:54:58.310 --> 02:54:59.610
900?

02:54:59.610 --> 02:55:00.910
&gt;&gt; Ayanna Legros: 900.

02:55:00.910 --> 02:55:02.210
&gt;&gt; Alejandra Bronfman: 900 tapes

02:55:02.210 --> 02:55:03.510
of a radio program
[foreign language],

02:55:03.510 --> 02:55:07.540
which ran from 1969 to 2000?

02:55:07.540 --> 02:55:08.840
&gt;&gt; Ayanna Legros: Two.

02:55:08.840 --> 02:55:10.140
&gt;&gt; Alejandra Bronfman: Two.

02:55:10.140 --> 02:55:12.520
And I don't know, do you want
to say anything about it?

02:55:12.520 --> 02:55:13.820
See if you can?

02:55:13.820 --> 02:55:15.120
&gt;&gt; Ayanna Legros: Yeah,
can people like hear me?

02:55:15.120 --> 02:55:16.420
&gt;&gt; Alejandra Bronfman:
Can you hear her?

02:55:16.420 --> 02:55:17.720
Yeah?

02:55:17.720 --> 02:55:19.020
&gt;&gt; Ayanna Legros: Oh wow.

02:55:19.020 --> 02:55:20.890
Okay. Great.

02:55:20.890 --> 02:55:24.920
Well good afternoon everyone.

02:55:24.920 --> 02:55:26.260
So, my Ayanna Legros.

02:55:26.260 --> 02:55:28.100
I am a first year PhD student in
the History Department at Duke.

02:55:28.100 --> 02:55:30.510
So, there are definitely
some overlaps

02:55:30.510 --> 02:55:35.580
between Craig and I's narrative.

02:55:35.580 --> 02:55:41.140
But I'll just open
up with something

02:55:41.140 --> 02:55:43.860
out of Columbia Universities
Daily Spectator Newspaper

02:55:43.860 --> 02:55:45.420
from April 4th, 1986.

02:55:45.420 --> 02:55:49.250
For the past 16 years members

02:55:49.250 --> 02:55:54.900
of New York City Haitian
community have aired [foreign

02:55:54.900 --> 02:55:56.200
language], the Haitian Hour,

02:55:56.200 --> 02:55:57.500
from Columbia student
operated radio station WKCR.

02:55:57.500 --> 02:56:02.470
Broadcast in Creole,
the show purpose

02:56:02.470 --> 02:56:06.380
to keep the Haitian community
in the tri state area informed

02:56:06.380 --> 02:56:08.120
about activities in Haiti and
other U.S. Haitian communities.

02:56:08.120 --> 02:56:18.090
But the shows controversial
politics have brought a host

02:56:18.090 --> 02:56:21.190
death and bomb threats, as
well as threatened lawsuits

02:56:21.190 --> 02:56:22.580
against the shows
inflammatory program director

02:56:22.580 --> 02:56:23.880
and broadcaster [foreign
language]

02:56:23.880 --> 02:56:32.590
volatile leftist content has
raised questions regarding the

02:56:32.590 --> 02:56:36.570
shows compliance with WKCR

02:56:36.570 --> 02:56:37.870
and Federal Communications
Commission, FCC,

02:56:37.870 --> 02:56:39.170
guidelines concerning
the broadcasting

02:56:39.170 --> 02:56:40.530
of political editorials
and monitoring procedures.

02:56:40.530 --> 02:56:47.710
Quote -- in trying to
serve both the New York

02:56:47.710 --> 02:56:49.980
and Columbia communities,

02:56:49.980 --> 02:56:55.910
we entered into an incredible
quagmire of legal, social,

02:56:55.910 --> 02:56:57.320
linguistic, administrative
and punitive problems,

02:56:57.320 --> 02:56:59.700
said Jonathon, WKCR's
station manager in 1985.

02:56:59.700 --> 02:57:05.370
So, [foreign language] ran
between 1969 through 2002

02:57:05.370 --> 02:57:09.180
out of WKCR, which is New York,

02:57:09.180 --> 02:57:12.080
which is Columbia
University's radio station.

02:57:12.080 --> 02:57:16.740
The show was founded by a group
of Haitian exiles slash students

02:57:16.740 --> 02:57:18.400
and was run in Haitian
Creole and at times

02:57:18.400 --> 02:57:19.700
in French and English.

02:57:19.700 --> 02:57:25.250
As the paragraph shares, the
show sought to connect members

02:57:25.250 --> 02:57:30.710
of the Haitian diaspora in
New York across the boroughs

02:57:30.710 --> 02:57:32.060
and disseminated news
Haitian culture and music.

02:57:32.060 --> 02:57:40.990
My interest in this project
was actually an accident,

02:57:40.990 --> 02:57:44.920
in that I was speaking with
one of my dad's friends

02:57:44.920 --> 02:57:46.220
and he mentioned that
these tapes were around.

02:57:46.220 --> 02:57:53.480
And obviously, I
knew about the show.

02:57:53.480 --> 02:57:57.210
As a little girl, I
often attended protests

02:57:57.210 --> 02:58:01.500
with my parents in New
York City regarding issues

02:58:01.500 --> 02:58:02.800
from [foreign language] death

02:58:02.800 --> 02:58:04.100
to [inaudible] being
overthrown and such matters.

02:58:04.100 --> 02:58:13.390
But honestly, I had
forgotten about the show,

02:58:13.390 --> 02:58:14.990
similar to my family members,
because of the reality

02:58:14.990 --> 02:58:16.290
that Haiti was not
going to be a space

02:58:16.290 --> 02:58:17.590
that we could return
to as a family.

02:58:17.590 --> 02:58:19.750
And so, in just a
random conversation

02:58:19.750 --> 02:58:24.940
with my dad's friend, he
mentioned that these tapes were

02:58:24.940 --> 02:58:29.180
around and they're in a
tool shed in Long Island.

02:58:29.180 --> 02:58:35.990
And so, this summer, like
most people who are interested

02:58:35.990 --> 02:58:40.710
in archival projects, I
ended up in someone's garage

02:58:40.710 --> 02:58:42.060
and tool shed kind of
digging through what existed.

02:58:42.060 --> 02:58:49.060
Very similar to Craig, this
interest is really driven

02:58:49.060 --> 02:58:56.910
by a desire to tell a
narrative about democracy,

02:58:56.910 --> 02:58:58.210
both in the United
States and Haiti.

02:58:58.210 --> 02:58:59.510
It's about Creole.

02:58:59.510 --> 02:59:00.810
It's about the diaspora.

02:59:00.810 --> 02:59:02.110
It's about living in exile.

02:59:02.110 --> 02:59:07.140
But, one thing that I
find incredibly unique

02:59:07.140 --> 02:59:11.070
about [foreign language] is
really kind of the desire

02:59:11.070 --> 02:59:12.500
to decolonize a university
space.

02:59:12.500 --> 02:59:17.820
What does it mean to be
a political radio show

02:59:17.820 --> 02:59:22.070
within a university
setting, particularly

02:59:22.070 --> 02:59:26.630
like Columbia University?

02:59:26.630 --> 02:59:32.350
And so, in those conversations
and in my desires of wanting

02:59:32.350 --> 02:59:33.650
to donate this collection,

02:59:33.650 --> 02:59:34.950
I've come across a
series of questions.

02:59:34.950 --> 02:59:37.630
Does Columbia University own
these rights for this show?

02:59:37.630 --> 02:59:47.070
Does, do the owners or creators
of the show own the rights?

02:59:47.070 --> 02:59:51.050
Does WKCR, the radio station
that operates independently

02:59:51.050 --> 02:59:53.450
out of Columbia University
own the rights?

02:59:53.450 --> 02:59:56.310
And so, there are so
many questions in, in,

02:59:56.310 --> 03:00:03.200
in seeking to find a home
for an archival collection.

03:00:03.200 --> 03:00:06.020
And I do want to share
that if there's anything

03:00:06.020 --> 03:00:09.690
that this process
has taught me it's

03:00:09.690 --> 03:00:15.000
that there's a major disconnect
between scholars and archivists,

03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:20.500
in terms of the type of labor
it takes to compose an archive.

03:00:20.500 --> 03:00:24.560
And so, I've become very
appreciative of, you know,

03:00:24.560 --> 03:00:29.980
just the mere action of walking
into a library and speaking

03:00:29.980 --> 03:00:32.050
with an archivist
around what is around.

03:00:32.050 --> 03:00:35.940
And so, if anyone has
any suggestions or ways

03:00:35.940 --> 03:00:43.320
that they can support in
this archive finding a home,

03:00:43.320 --> 03:00:48.560
Alejandra can share my
contact information.

03:00:48.560 --> 03:00:50.340
And I want to thank you all for
allowing me to join in with you

03:00:50.340 --> 03:00:51.640
on this Saturday afternoon.

03:00:51.640 --> 03:00:52.940
&gt;&gt; Alejandra Bronfman:
Thank you.

03:00:52.940 --> 03:00:54.240
[Applause].

03:00:54.240 --> 03:00:56.910
So I think we all
share a lot in,

03:00:56.910 --> 03:01:01.080
of sort of similar
concerns and interests.

03:01:01.080 --> 03:01:04.080
So, I'm just going to
throw it open now for all

03:01:04.080 --> 03:01:06.710
of the panelists, all of
the questions for anybody

03:01:06.710 --> 03:01:09.470
who spoke even earlier.

03:01:13.370 --> 03:01:14.670
Questions, comments.

03:01:14.670 --> 03:01:15.970
Yeah?

03:01:15.970 --> 03:01:18.250
&gt;&gt; What is the name
of the collection

03:01:18.250 --> 03:01:19.550
that is being offered?

03:01:19.550 --> 03:01:20.850
&gt;&gt; Alejandra Bronfman: This one?

03:01:20.850 --> 03:01:22.150
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

03:01:22.150 --> 03:01:23.450
&gt;&gt; Alejandra Bronfman:
It's [foreign language].

03:01:23.450 --> 03:01:24.750
&gt;&gt; Ayanna Legros: It
means the Haitian Hour.

03:01:24.750 --> 03:01:26.050
&gt;&gt; Alejandra Bronfman:
The Haitian Hour.

03:01:26.050 --> 03:01:28.350
Yeah.

03:01:31.600 --> 03:01:33.470
Questions, comments.

03:01:33.470 --> 03:01:35.270
Yeah?

03:01:35.270 --> 03:01:57.140
[ Inaudible ]

03:01:57.140 --> 03:01:59.530
&gt;&gt; Either over the
air or online, right?

03:01:59.530 --> 03:02:00.830
That's a way.

03:02:00.830 --> 03:02:04.180
Sorry. That's, you know,
one way to remind people

03:02:04.180 --> 03:02:05.720
of the importance
of these materials.

03:02:05.720 --> 03:02:07.200
So, I think that's
the other piece

03:02:07.200 --> 03:02:10.150
of the collaboration
circle is, you know,

03:02:10.150 --> 03:02:11.900
are our various options.

03:02:11.900 --> 03:02:14.380
And, you know, this
may go back to some

03:02:14.380 --> 03:02:16.730
of the conversation this
morning about the importance

03:02:16.730 --> 03:02:19.630
of college radio, the importance
of low power FM, right?

03:02:19.630 --> 03:02:22.380
That there are these radio
outlets that we might be able

03:02:22.380 --> 03:02:28.210
to utilize as a way to kind of
complete that circle, right?

03:02:28.210 --> 03:02:31.120
and, you know, bring these
materials back to people,

03:02:31.120 --> 03:02:35.140
which also then is a
reminder of their importance

03:02:35.140 --> 03:02:37.510
if we can deal with, you
know, as was brought up,

03:02:37.510 --> 03:02:40.630
the rights questions and some of
those things that may come up,

03:02:40.630 --> 03:02:42.480
which are of course
going to be part of that.

03:02:42.480 --> 03:02:45.160
But, so, I think there are
a lot of really, you know,

03:02:45.160 --> 03:02:48.680
great opportunities to
do those kind of things.

03:02:48.680 --> 03:02:51.310
And I'll just say really
quickly, I mean, you know,

03:02:51.310 --> 03:02:53.870
my work is mostly in Argentina

03:02:53.870 --> 03:02:57.110
and [foreign language] is
actually doing this great thing

03:02:57.110 --> 03:03:01.060
where they're bringing back old
radionovelas, not super old,

03:03:01.060 --> 03:03:04.200
but from the 60's and 70's,
putting them back on the air

03:03:04.200 --> 03:03:06.880
and putting them up on their
website, so, with information,

03:03:06.880 --> 03:03:08.180
with some documentation.

03:03:08.180 --> 03:03:10.780
So, I mean, they're bringing
it back and, you know,

03:03:10.780 --> 03:03:13.160
using it as content, but
also as a way of kind

03:03:13.160 --> 03:03:16.670
of reminding people of,
you know, bringing some

03:03:16.670 --> 03:03:18.210
of those historical
material back

03:03:18.210 --> 03:03:20.040
into people's consciousness.

03:03:20.040 --> 03:03:22.110
So, I think there's a
lot of interesting things

03:03:22.110 --> 03:03:25.690
that can be done there
in the right situation.

03:03:25.690 --> 03:03:28.690
Thanks.

03:03:28.690 --> 03:03:30.490
&gt;&gt; Alejandra Bronfman: Yeah?

03:03:30.490 --> 03:03:40.430
[ Inaudible ]

03:03:40.430 --> 03:03:41.730
&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.

03:03:41.730 --> 03:03:44.440
In terms of preservation,
I was wondering

03:03:44.440 --> 03:03:47.830
if there's other
strategies besides, you know,

03:03:47.830 --> 03:03:50.650
room temperature rooms and
so forth in terms of tapes.

03:03:50.650 --> 03:03:53.240
Because I'm just thinking about
all the various different,

03:03:53.240 --> 03:03:55.430
particularly in the area
that I'm working in,

03:03:55.430 --> 03:03:58.750
in terms of Spanish language,
bilingual, indigenous programing

03:03:58.750 --> 03:04:01.080
that sometimes is not even
located in a radio station,

03:04:01.080 --> 03:04:02.380
but it's just a program

03:04:02.380 --> 03:04:06.200
that happens once a
week, or once a month.

03:04:06.200 --> 03:04:07.570
And so, trying to think

03:04:07.570 --> 03:04:09.800
about how do we preserve
those programs

03:04:09.800 --> 03:04:11.890
that don't even have a
bigger infrastructure.

03:04:11.890 --> 03:04:14.750
If there's any strategies
that you can offer

03:04:14.750 --> 03:04:18.560
that folks might be able to
take back to be able to utilize,

03:04:18.560 --> 03:04:22.590
either that can still be sort
of DIY or that, you know,

03:04:22.590 --> 03:04:28.360
it doesn't have to be so labor
or capital, you know, intensive.

03:04:28.360 --> 03:04:29.970
&gt;&gt; Antonio Pereira: Right.

03:04:29.970 --> 03:04:31.270
Well, two things.

03:04:31.270 --> 03:04:34.240
I mean for older content
that, the content that's

03:04:34.240 --> 03:04:38.870
on analog media, I don't
think there's an easy answer.

03:04:38.870 --> 03:04:41.890
I mean you are looking at
some kind of a migration

03:04:41.890 --> 03:04:44.910
or digitization process
that is going

03:04:44.910 --> 03:04:47.660
to cost some amount of money.

03:04:47.660 --> 03:04:50.050
There's a, I think from
this point forward approach

03:04:50.050 --> 03:04:53.940
to contents being created
now that could, you know,

03:04:53.940 --> 03:04:57.200
reasonably, and this
could be, you know,

03:04:57.200 --> 03:05:02.890
for an interesting project is to
start setting up some sort of,

03:05:02.890 --> 03:05:05.340
I hate to use the
term best practices

03:05:05.340 --> 03:05:07.640
because that usually means
really expensive practices.

03:05:07.640 --> 03:05:10.650
But, you know, more appropriate
practices that will allow people

03:05:10.650 --> 03:05:12.790
to sort of understand if
we want to preserve this,

03:05:12.790 --> 03:05:14.690
here are some things we
should do at this point,

03:05:14.690 --> 03:05:17.490
the point of creation
that'll make all

03:05:17.490 --> 03:05:21.440
of those necessary
migrations, etcetera,

03:05:21.440 --> 03:05:23.160
simpler and less expensive.

03:05:23.160 --> 03:05:26.380
And I think that would
be relatively easy to do,

03:05:26.380 --> 03:05:29.420
especially in audio, which
we're, you know, we really kind

03:05:29.420 --> 03:05:31.180
of understand the digital world.

03:05:31.180 --> 03:05:32.650
Video is a little
more difficult.

03:05:32.650 --> 03:05:34.340
It's still kind of
wild, Wild West.

03:05:34.340 --> 03:05:38.440
But in the audio world, I
think we could setup a variety

03:05:38.440 --> 03:05:40.290
of suggestions and guidelines

03:05:40.290 --> 03:05:42.870
that would lower the cost
ultimately of preservation.

03:05:42.870 --> 03:05:47.030
It would make the handoffs much
simpler and easier to achieve.

03:05:47.030 --> 03:05:51.050
But, as far as analog goes,
that's, that's still costly.

03:05:51.050 --> 03:05:53.580
I don't know any other
ways around that.

03:06:02.140 --> 03:06:03.830
&gt;&gt; Hi, it's such an
interesting panel.

03:06:03.830 --> 03:06:05.130
Thank you.

03:06:05.130 --> 03:06:07.730
If there is anything
that I've kind

03:06:07.730 --> 03:06:11.520
of learned the last two day is
the significance of undergrads,

03:06:11.520 --> 03:06:13.340
grad students and interns.

03:06:13.340 --> 03:06:16.070
In radio preservation,
there's this need for them

03:06:16.070 --> 03:06:20.220
to do this manual labor that was
also mentioned on this panel,

03:06:20.220 --> 03:06:23.190
which yes provides a
learning experience

03:06:23.190 --> 03:06:28.010
and they get compensated with
credits and learning experience,

03:06:28.010 --> 03:06:31.200
but it's also, we look to them

03:06:31.200 --> 03:06:34.200
for cheap labor in
some way, right?

03:06:34.200 --> 03:06:35.970
But I think this
is the one panel,

03:06:35.970 --> 03:06:38.880
particularly your comments
that kind of made me feel

03:06:38.880 --> 03:06:40.610
that we could shift some

03:06:40.610 --> 03:06:43.960
of the collaboration
dynamics with that.

03:06:43.960 --> 03:06:46.370
And by saying that once
you share collaboration,

03:06:46.370 --> 03:06:47.980
you share authority.

03:06:47.980 --> 03:06:51.720
So, this idea of including
everybody, not just people

03:06:51.720 --> 03:06:55.740
who tap into the archives,
but kind of acknowledging

03:06:55.740 --> 03:06:58.330
who found them, who's
cataloging them,

03:06:58.330 --> 03:07:00.610
who's cleaning them, right?

03:07:00.610 --> 03:07:02.850
I think it'd be really
interesting to kind

03:07:02.850 --> 03:07:06.630
of rethink preservation
by including everybody

03:07:06.630 --> 03:07:08.960
that is a part of every
single step, right?

03:07:08.960 --> 03:07:11.550
Not just the person who
authors the ultimate paper

03:07:11.550 --> 03:07:12.850
or something like that.

03:07:12.850 --> 03:07:14.260
So, it was very thought
provoking panel.

03:07:14.260 --> 03:07:15.560
Thank you.

03:07:15.560 --> 03:07:17.360
&gt;&gt; Alejandra Bronfman: Yeah,
I just want to jump onto that

03:07:17.360 --> 03:07:18.660
because I've been thinking

03:07:18.660 --> 03:07:20.990
as everybody has been speaking
including the first panel

03:07:20.990 --> 03:07:23.140
and then ours and then
your comments as well,

03:07:23.140 --> 03:07:25.190
is that it strikes me
that one of the things

03:07:25.190 --> 03:07:29.360
about these two panels is
about is decolonization, right?

03:07:29.360 --> 03:07:31.720
And decolonizing radio studies,

03:07:31.720 --> 03:07:34.810
decolonizing radio
and all of that.

03:07:34.810 --> 03:07:39.130
And as much as I liked the first
two talks by Michele Hilmes

03:07:39.130 --> 03:07:43.710
and Susan Douglas, that's not
one of the sort of priorities

03:07:43.710 --> 03:07:45.700
that they set for radio
studies and I think

03:07:45.700 --> 03:07:49.760
that we really need make a push
for that, in terms of just look

03:07:49.760 --> 03:07:51.060
at where we are in the program.

03:07:51.060 --> 03:07:53.510
Look at how they've put
us opposite, you know,

03:07:53.510 --> 03:07:55.700
African American studies,
which we would actually benefit

03:07:55.700 --> 03:07:57.650
from all going to that panel.

03:07:57.650 --> 03:08:01.530
So, I think that there's a real
need to kind of keep pushing.

03:08:01.530 --> 03:08:06.340
So, yeah. And especially in
terms of what Robert said

03:08:06.340 --> 03:08:15.580
about de-authorizing the archive
and things like that as well.

03:08:15.580 --> 03:08:16.880
[Inaudible].

03:08:16.880 --> 03:08:18.180
Yeah. [Inaudible].

03:08:18.180 --> 03:08:21.550
Yeah, that's right.

03:08:21.550 --> 03:08:22.850
Yeah.

03:08:22.850 --> 03:08:24.230
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] broader
priorities that are happening

03:08:24.230 --> 03:08:26.890
within the task force.

03:08:26.890 --> 03:08:29.810
And about what exactly it
is that we're doing here.

03:08:29.810 --> 03:08:32.420
So, I mean, I think that those
are bigger questions of us,

03:08:32.420 --> 03:08:36.200
but also power that are
not really being addressed,

03:08:36.200 --> 03:08:38.460
but that we are sort
of underlying a lot

03:08:38.460 --> 03:08:39.760
of what's being discussed.

03:08:39.760 --> 03:08:41.060
&gt;&gt; Alejandra Bronfman:
Yeah, I agree.

03:08:41.060 --> 03:08:43.530
&gt;&gt; Craig Breaden: Can I chime
in on that a little bit?

03:08:43.530 --> 03:08:44.830
&gt;&gt; Alejandra Bronfman: Yeah.

03:08:44.830 --> 03:08:46.130
&gt;&gt; Craig Breaden: We.

03:08:46.130 --> 03:08:47.430
I think whether or not
we get a second grant

03:08:47.430 --> 03:08:48.730
for our Radio Haiti stuff,

03:08:48.730 --> 03:08:50.440
we're going to explore
the YouTube possibility

03:08:50.440 --> 03:08:51.740
for putting the collection
on there,

03:08:51.740 --> 03:08:54.270
which obviously there are a lot
of technical problems with that.

03:08:54.270 --> 03:08:55.780
But we've talked to
YouTube a little bit

03:08:55.780 --> 03:08:57.890
and they're interested
in supporting that.

03:08:57.890 --> 03:09:00.560
And the idea, of course,
is to be rebroadcasting

03:09:00.560 --> 03:09:01.860
that material in Haiti.

03:09:01.860 --> 03:09:03.870
That's essentially
what we'd be doing.

03:09:03.870 --> 03:09:07.730
But, to your question about DIY?

03:09:07.730 --> 03:09:12.490
I love DIY and as an
archivist in a big institution,

03:09:12.490 --> 03:09:14.570
it's not real, it's not
a real popular stance

03:09:14.570 --> 03:09:16.440
because we have all sorts
of standards that we have

03:09:16.440 --> 03:09:18.380
to really [inaudible] to.

03:09:18.380 --> 03:09:23.240
But there are a lot of tools
out there now that you can use

03:09:23.240 --> 03:09:26.850
with some risks, but I got to
tell you that there are risks

03:09:26.850 --> 03:09:30.170
in an institutional
archive like my own as well

03:09:30.170 --> 03:09:32.500
that you need to
take into account.

03:09:32.500 --> 03:09:36.570
But, between YouTube,
Google Drive, Amazon Cloud,

03:09:36.570 --> 03:09:40.560
the things that can be done
DIY to keep your stuff safe

03:09:40.560 --> 03:09:44.200
if you do it with a design,
is something that is,

03:09:44.200 --> 03:09:45.620
is actually possible today.

03:09:45.620 --> 03:09:46.940
The tools are there.

03:09:46.940 --> 03:09:49.810
And I occasionally teach
an oral history workshop

03:09:49.810 --> 03:09:51.980
and I have people come in
from the community, you know,

03:09:51.980 --> 03:09:53.620
or small historical societies

03:09:53.620 --> 03:09:55.970
and they ask me this
question, like what can we do.

03:09:55.970 --> 03:09:58.740
And I say well there are
a lot of tools out there.

03:09:58.740 --> 03:10:00.400
And they know what
the tools are,

03:10:00.400 --> 03:10:04.450
but the important part
is to have a plan.

03:10:04.450 --> 03:10:06.880
And to. And the standards
for metadata

03:10:06.880 --> 03:10:10.020
that we use are really
readily available

03:10:10.020 --> 03:10:12.040
and they can be used
for any collection.

03:10:12.040 --> 03:10:14.230
It doesn't have to
just be in a library.

03:10:14.230 --> 03:10:19.180
So, I really encourage, I really
encourage DIY if it's done

03:10:19.180 --> 03:10:22.070
in a way that has
a design behind it,

03:10:22.070 --> 03:10:23.740
because if that material
ends up going

03:10:23.740 --> 03:10:26.130
to an institutional archive,
like Duke or someplace

03:10:26.130 --> 03:10:30.170
like that, that gives us a real
leg up in the process of trying

03:10:30.170 --> 03:10:32.830
to move those materials
into the archive.

03:10:32.830 --> 03:10:35.740
Even if every, you
know, T isn't' crossed

03:10:35.740 --> 03:10:38.230
and I isn't dotted,
it really helps us.

03:10:38.230 --> 03:10:42.320
And I think actually I had this
conversation with Ayanna as well

03:10:42.320 --> 03:10:46.080
about some basic tools
that can be used.

03:10:46.080 --> 03:10:47.380
So.

03:10:47.380 --> 03:10:49.320
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

03:10:49.320 --> 03:10:50.950
This is. If I am
going to express it

03:10:50.950 --> 03:10:52.260
in quite the way
that will make sense.

03:10:52.260 --> 03:10:55.620
But I. one of the points
that was made earlier

03:10:55.620 --> 03:10:57.680
in the morning session
too was the talk

03:10:57.680 --> 03:11:02.800
about how important global radio
is because it's so valuable

03:11:02.800 --> 03:11:04.260
in third world countries.

03:11:04.260 --> 03:11:07.650
But the truth is that within the
United States it's very valuable

03:11:07.650 --> 03:11:08.950
to communities of color.

03:11:08.950 --> 03:11:12.650
And that's one thing too that,
you know, I've heard in going

03:11:12.650 --> 03:11:14.450
to the different sessions.

03:11:14.450 --> 03:11:19.940
And the value of making
sure that that's archived is

03:11:19.940 --> 03:11:21.430
because they were
talking about worried

03:11:21.430 --> 03:11:23.080
about the future of radio.

03:11:23.080 --> 03:11:28.900
But the truth is that radio is,
is effective tool right now,

03:11:28.900 --> 03:11:30.270
you know, in communities
of color.

03:11:30.270 --> 03:11:32.060
And that's not going
to change too soon.

03:11:32.060 --> 03:11:36.390
Because when you look at
areas like Eastern Washington,

03:11:36.390 --> 03:11:38.760
there is also a digital divide.

03:11:38.760 --> 03:11:42.500
So, it's not like everybody has
access, you know, to internet

03:11:42.500 --> 03:11:45.130
or podcasts or internet radio.

03:11:45.130 --> 03:11:47.110
It's radio that's
the effective tool.

03:11:47.110 --> 03:11:49.690
And its radio that goes
out into, you know,

03:11:49.690 --> 03:11:54.060
the agriculture fields and as
Ines mentioned that the one

03:11:54.060 --> 03:11:55.800
that you hear in
restaurants and so forth.

03:11:55.800 --> 03:11:59.770
So, it's still a very
viable and important means

03:11:59.770 --> 03:12:01.930
of mass communication
for communities

03:12:01.930 --> 03:12:04.230
of color in this country.

03:12:09.420 --> 03:12:12.430
&gt;&gt; I actually, you know, this
is such an interesting idea.

03:12:12.430 --> 03:12:15.600
The idea of putting
archives back on the air.

03:12:15.600 --> 03:12:18.390
I'm letting it kind of
stew and sit with me

03:12:18.390 --> 03:12:21.450
because there's some, you
know, Mexican radio programs

03:12:21.450 --> 03:12:24.460
from the 1920's, 30's that I do
not want to, I don't want to get

03:12:24.460 --> 03:12:26.490
that back on the air now, right?

03:12:26.490 --> 03:12:28.300
and there is such a struggle

03:12:28.300 --> 03:12:33.300
to have fresh contemporary
programming,

03:12:33.300 --> 03:12:36.000
something that was
not used previously

03:12:36.000 --> 03:12:38.380
on Spanish language
broadcast radio

03:12:38.380 --> 03:12:40.720
at least in the United States.

03:12:40.720 --> 03:12:44.240
That, I'm just, I'm having
it stew a little bit.

03:12:44.240 --> 03:12:47.510
In the [foreign language] I
actually heard a presentation

03:12:47.510 --> 03:12:50.720
from [foreign language] who
has done a preliminary analysis

03:12:50.720 --> 03:12:54.440
of some of those shows
and she does amazing,

03:12:54.440 --> 03:12:55.740
amazing archival work.

03:12:55.740 --> 03:12:57.040
Her analysis was amazing.

03:12:57.040 --> 03:13:00.260
But she gave a wonderful
political kind

03:13:00.260 --> 03:13:03.120
of racial analysis of that,
Cuban [foreign language].

03:13:03.120 --> 03:13:05.700
And I'm not sure if you replayed

03:13:05.700 --> 03:13:10.650
that today how listeners
would react.

03:13:10.650 --> 03:13:12.960
Because the political
context is so different

03:13:12.960 --> 03:13:14.770
and depending on the listeners.

03:13:14.770 --> 03:13:18.310
So, I'm kind of thinking of what
little I know of that archive

03:13:18.310 --> 03:13:22.180
and how excited Spanish
language radio listeners are.

03:13:22.180 --> 03:13:24.930
You know, I'm thinking
of like even

03:13:24.930 --> 03:13:28.490
with [foreign language] the 70's
when Latin File was on the air,

03:13:28.490 --> 03:13:30.620
how that was politically
significant

03:13:30.620 --> 03:13:33.620
because it was something
fresh and contemporary.

03:13:33.620 --> 03:13:36.610
And it wasn't something
that somebody pulled out.

03:13:36.610 --> 03:13:39.020
Because I think people
automatically think oh it's

03:13:39.020 --> 03:13:42.230
because of budget cuts or
there's nothing else to fill

03:13:42.230 --> 03:13:45.080
in the content of
it kind of thing.

03:13:45.080 --> 03:13:48.700
So, I love the idea of it,
but I'm letting it stew

03:13:48.700 --> 03:13:51.260
within this other, with all
these other kind of factors

03:13:51.260 --> 03:13:53.800
that I'm kind of thinking about.

03:13:53.800 --> 03:13:56.100
FYI.

03:14:01.060 --> 03:14:02.360
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

03:14:02.360 --> 03:14:04.630
So, I'm Laura [foreign
language] and I work at NPR

03:14:04.630 --> 03:14:10.100
and I manage the archives
and our digitalization labs.

03:14:10.100 --> 03:14:11.400
And two things I want to say.

03:14:11.400 --> 03:14:16.000
One about interns and doing
in house digitization.

03:14:16.000 --> 03:14:17.750
I'm going to the point

03:14:17.750 --> 03:14:21.370
of equipment being
very difficult to find.

03:14:21.370 --> 03:14:26.000
The way we do it, I
have 20 [inaudible] now.

03:14:26.000 --> 03:14:31.230
I ask [inaudible] and email,
I email groups of engineers,

03:14:31.230 --> 03:14:34.170
broadcast engineers,
public radio people

03:14:34.170 --> 03:14:37.690
to ask do you have any
[inaudible] in your garage,

03:14:37.690 --> 03:14:40.600
in your, you know,
basement, whatever.

03:14:40.600 --> 03:14:43.030
Can you give it to me
in any shape or form?

03:14:43.030 --> 03:14:44.740
And I got 15.

03:14:44.740 --> 03:14:47.920
And we had about two or three
and then now I got more.

03:14:47.920 --> 03:14:50.640
So, in total if have 20.

03:14:50.640 --> 03:14:54.370
We are [inaudible] each one and
we are making new ones out of,

03:14:54.370 --> 03:14:57.100
I mean we refurbished them.

03:14:57.100 --> 03:15:01.990
So, that gave us a very
good beginning for our lab.

03:15:01.990 --> 03:15:06.450
So far in two years we
have digitalized 60,

03:15:06.450 --> 03:15:12.410
no 45 thousand hours from
CD and reels, mostly reels.

03:15:12.410 --> 03:15:18.460
About interns, we use, I have
two staff, audio engineers,

03:15:18.460 --> 03:15:21.640
two audio engineers or your
specialist and we work with up

03:15:21.640 --> 03:15:23.060
to three interns per term.

03:15:23.060 --> 03:15:26.110
So, if I find the
right candidate,

03:15:26.110 --> 03:15:28.900
I will have nine
interns in one year.

03:15:28.900 --> 03:15:32.830
But, yes they are not cheap
labor, they are students.

03:15:32.830 --> 03:15:36.370
But they are getting lots of
knowledge and the way I see it,

03:15:36.370 --> 03:15:39.400
I am preparing audiovisual
people for the field.

03:15:39.400 --> 03:15:42.620
Because in the future, all of
you will have to be digitizing.

03:15:42.620 --> 03:15:45.650
All of us in this
conference here.

03:15:45.650 --> 03:15:48.390
Eventually those
archives will have to be.

03:15:48.390 --> 03:15:52.910
And you know what I feel
we will lots of expert,

03:15:52.910 --> 03:15:56.570
because what they are doing
in our labs is high scale.

03:15:56.570 --> 03:15:59.870
We do sometimes 48
tapes in one day.

03:15:59.870 --> 03:16:02.860
So, that is 48 hours.

03:16:02.860 --> 03:16:08.030
And the other good things, most
of these students are women.

03:16:08.030 --> 03:16:11.780
So, we are getting women
in the field as well.

03:16:20.070 --> 03:16:21.370
&gt;&gt; Alejandra Bronfman:
Anything else.

03:16:21.370 --> 03:16:22.670
I guess it's almost
time to be done.

03:16:22.670 --> 03:16:23.970
I just had an idea
as we were talking

03:16:23.970 --> 03:16:26.940
that maybe we'd do this
a little bit informally,

03:16:26.940 --> 03:16:29.740
but maybe we should have
a list server that anybody

03:16:29.740 --> 03:16:31.540
in this room can
join and we can sort

03:16:31.540 --> 03:16:33.330
of keep this conversation going.

03:16:33.330 --> 03:16:35.470
So it doesn't just
happen once a year.

03:16:35.470 --> 03:16:39.040
So, maybe if you just want to
come up and write your name down

03:16:39.040 --> 03:16:43.050
and see if I can sort of create
a list or whatever it is that.

03:16:43.050 --> 03:16:45.080
I think that that
would be really useful.

03:16:45.080 --> 03:16:49.080
But I just want to thank both
panels, everybody on the panels

03:16:49.080 --> 03:16:51.880
for coming and sharing
and talking today.

03:16:51.880 --> 03:16:53.680
Thank you.
