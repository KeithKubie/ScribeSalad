1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:02,583
Okay.

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:07,300
And we're live. What's up Yo, dude,

3
00:00:07,301 --> 00:00:10,330
you're on a rollercoaster ride.
What is it like to be the champ?

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,810
What's the feeling like this is
fresh for you? Oh, well first of all,

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,560
I just want to say, man, it's such an
honor to be here. Um, the honor is mine.

6
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:22,120
I never, I'm gonna I'm
gonna be honest. Um, um,

7
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,230
my thing is I'm just going to
be 100% and totally transparent.

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,840
I was never,
I never really watched the show.

9
00:00:28,841 --> 00:00:30,610
I never really kind of heard of this show.

10
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:33,300
Of course I heard of you and all the
things you do. I'm like, Oh yeah,

11
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,140
it's fear factor guy and all,

12
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:40,170
but I never really heard of this show
until like after like a fight or two in

13
00:00:40,481 --> 00:00:43,240
the UFC and people are like
tagging me and shit. Like,

14
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,420
Yo Joe Rogan's talking by Joe.
Ranga talked about you in pocket.

15
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:49,360
I'm like fucking podcast. Cause I'd
never listened to podcasts at the time.

16
00:00:49,361 --> 00:00:52,720
I was like, oof, what are you talking
about? Until I finally started listening,

17
00:00:52,721 --> 00:00:57,580
I'm like, oh, this dude is for real.
This dude got some, some, some pool.

18
00:00:57,581 --> 00:01:01,030
You've got some people watching this shit.
Random people would tag me.

19
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,750
Oh Joel was talking about you today
on the podcast. I'm like, Oh man,

20
00:01:04,751 --> 00:01:07,480
this guy's for real. And then every
time after that that I see you,

21
00:01:07,481 --> 00:01:09,520
I'm like sub Gel.

22
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,630
Yeah we've been talking about
you for a long time man.

23
00:01:13,631 --> 00:01:15,400
We were just with your friend out there.

24
00:01:15,401 --> 00:01:18,520
We're watching a video of us talking
about you back when you were ranked number

25
00:01:18,521 --> 00:01:22,510
12 and I was saying I think you can
fight for the title right now. Yeah man.

26
00:01:22,511 --> 00:01:26,170
That um,
and I I like to attest it to,

27
00:01:26,171 --> 00:01:29,530
I think because I went back once
I started kind of researching you,

28
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,280
I like to go back and do a little research
and I'm like fucking Joe's been with

29
00:01:33,281 --> 00:01:36,220
this,
this sport for the beginning.

30
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:41,580
Like you were in the back with hair
[inaudible] the hair freaking interview in

31
00:01:43,391 --> 00:01:47,350
the guys yet during the tournament that
we're finding multiple fights and night

32
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,440
and you were interviewing those guys
and I was like damn. Even back there,

33
00:01:50,441 --> 00:01:53,890
Joe had skills. Joel was the
beast interview in these guys.

34
00:01:53,891 --> 00:01:56,830
There was no shaking behind it.
Cause I, you know one thing about me,

35
00:01:56,831 --> 00:02:01,090
I've gotten into comp and commentating
and things like that now and I'm like

36
00:02:01,091 --> 00:02:04,870
Dang Joe, he didn't seem nervous. You
would just like a freaking natural at it.

37
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,840
And the sport was just growing
at that time. I was like,

38
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:10,990
there was nobody watching back then.
It wasn't as much pressure, you know,

39
00:02:10,991 --> 00:02:15,370
it wasn't like coming into it today.
Yeah. Espn paper view, all that deal.

40
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,630
It would be a lot of pressure. But
back then it was just fun. Yeah it was.

41
00:02:19,631 --> 00:02:22,240
It was weird man.
The first one I did was in Dothan,

42
00:02:22,241 --> 00:02:23,790
Alabama and this weird like it was,

43
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,150
I don't know if it was a high
school gym or some small auditorium,

44
00:02:28,151 --> 00:02:30,940
tiny little place. It was
very weird. They have a,

45
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:35,380
you made it look like a freaking certain
little walk in the park. I mean it was,

46
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,310
I was like damn chosen good at the
gentleman doing this shit for a wow. Well,

47
00:02:39,311 --> 00:02:42,110
it's a, it's an interesting
thing to see, you know,

48
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:45,580
to see it progress from 1997
to where it's out of 2019.

49
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,100
The biggest difference is not just,
uh,

50
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,300
the amount of eyes at accounts in amount
of people that are paying attention to

51
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:56,710
the real difference is the level
of athlete. It's a, it's a giant,

52
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,600
giant leap.
Like in no other sport,

53
00:02:58,601 --> 00:03:03,601
I don't think there's another sport
from 1993 to 2019 where the athletes are

54
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:08,560
almost, it's almost unrecognizable. How
much better the fighters are as Lilly,

55
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,480
you know, it's now back in
the day it was like, okay,

56
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,630
you finished your college career,
you finished all this,

57
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:20,440
you've got to the height of whatever
you know, sport you could be,

58
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:24,280
let's start fighting.
And so guys were coming in at 28,

59
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,190
27 starting to learn the tricks.

60
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:31,000
Now you've got freaking
10 year old kids sparring.

61
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:36,250
There's all these crazy videos like little
bitty kids fighting in like Russia or

62
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:40,010
other places. Like they're full on
MMA fighting. Yeah, totally distinct.

63
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,710
That whole promotion. I'm like, man,
by the time these guys get to 1617,

64
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:46,020
they're going to be killers.
Have,

65
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:51,050
if you go back and watch like a boxing
match from like 93 a by a world champion

66
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:53,620
boxer like Marvin Hagler,
perfect example,

67
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:58,650
Marvin Hagler from the 80s
could absolutely hang with
w middleweights like he's,

68
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:02,530
he would fit right in with world
champions today. Absolutely.

69
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,270
But a UFC champ from 93 mean ah,
it's just not the same.

70
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:11,920
It's not by any stretch. It's, it is such
a, back then it was like a, it was wild.

71
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:15,070
It was crazy. But nobody
had endurance. And you know,

72
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:19,430
there was a few guys that had some
skill and certainly our v Orlando VA or

73
00:04:19,431 --> 00:04:22,930
hoists Gracie, there was guys are
really good at their individual arts,

74
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:26,710
but there was no real
complete fighters yet. Yeah.

75
00:04:26,711 --> 00:04:28,690
You got the transition because it was,

76
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,350
everyone came in with their special
skills and that was, that was a big thing.

77
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:37,270
I think UFC even sold that as, oh yeah,
you got the wrestler firing, the calm,

78
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:42,100
the Combo, the sambal guy
and the Jujitsu guy. And, uh,

79
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,121
so that was the thing.

80
00:04:43,121 --> 00:04:47,030
Everyone came in with their one skill
and they put it to the test to see what

81
00:04:47,031 --> 00:04:51,910
you still watch better. It's
freaking crazy. Joe. My first fight,

82
00:04:51,911 --> 00:04:53,680
first time I ever watched a UFC fight,

83
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:59,260
I was visiting John Jones
in college freshman year.

84
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,200
This was our, our, our
freshman year to freshman year.

85
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,380
I was visiting him cause I went to uh,

86
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:07,240
a small school unit when
William Penn University,

87
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:11,110
which was about two hours away from him.
He was at Iowa Central in Fort Dodge,

88
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:16,000
Iowa. So I went to go spend my fall break
a whole week with him just hanging out

89
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,450
because we had met the previous year
in high school and just, you know,

90
00:05:19,451 --> 00:05:22,780
it's two brothers and wrestling. It was
like, hey two brothers, what's up man?

91
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:27,500
Where you go, let's go like shares, like
I'll be, I was like show me too as well.

92
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:30,610
We kept in touch and I want
them to hang out with him.

93
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:35,100
And during that week it was a fight
on someone, like a friend of the team,

94
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,900
something like that invited us to
come to his house and watch it.

95
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:42,190
And we went over there to watch the
fights. I had never really heard of it.

96
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,390
I never really cared.

97
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:47,710
I was just at freshman just trying to
hang out with John and Paul uses around,

98
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,500
this was 2005 to I think,
yeah,

99
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:53,710
2005 so it was like first season
of the ultimate fighter. Yeah,

100
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,160
2005 so we go on,

101
00:05:56,161 --> 00:05:59,090
I think it might've been Randy couture
or somewhat John just reminded,

102
00:05:59,091 --> 00:06:02,690
but I forgot who was fighting and we
went to the House party and watched it.

103
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,710
I really didn't really remember the
fight cause I didn't really care.

104
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:08,000
I never paid attention to it.

105
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,660
I never thought I would ever do something
like that. So I just watched it.

106
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:15,770
And then I remember the guy saying,
hey man, you guys can do this.

107
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,340
Why don't you guys try this?
And I was,

108
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,190
I mean John kind of looked
at each other like hell no.

109
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:26,090
And the way we go and do that shit. You
know, wrestling is controlled. You know,

110
00:06:26,091 --> 00:06:29,420
there's rules, you know, certain
things you can or can't do.

111
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:34,340
There's no way we're doing that. So we
kind of laughed it off and left that day.

112
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,690
Never knew that I freaking,
years later I'd be doing this.
