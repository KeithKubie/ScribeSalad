00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560
I did a little bit of tweeting yesterday, as one does,

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.940
and uh I was talking a bit about my, uh,

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.420
anxiety and depression.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.360
Which are things that I have.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.040
Now you know that.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.320
It's been a long road for me figuring out, kind of,

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.400
what on earth has been going on with my brain.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.220
I've had anxiety I think all my life,

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.660
and depression started when I was around 16,
I wanna say.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.380
Which, coincidentally is when I started YouTube.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.000
Don't know if those two things are connected but... pretty sure they are.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.680
And for a long time I sort of felt like
those were just things that I was,

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.860
like I was just an anxious person,

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.100
I was just a bit of a depressed person sometimes.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.520
But I also didn't really feel comfortable kind of, um,

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.620
admitting that I had any real problems, you know?

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.940
I honestly just thought I was being, you know,

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.920
a bit whiney, you know, I thought,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.860
it's not that I'm depressed, I'm just lazy.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.240
It's not that I'm... you know, anxious I'm...

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.180
I'm just a bit scared, that's the way I am,
I need to, you know...

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.960
man up and- and deal with it.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.380
Part of the reason I was sort of,

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.220
nervous to talk about this topic as well is because

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.360
there is, a kind of, a certain amount of

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.380
bumming out that you're allowed
to do on YouTube it feels like.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.360
It's OK to have problems in videos so long as you can

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.579
find a way to say at the end that you, you know,

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:17.119
you're getting through, you know,
you gotta find the upside.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.800
In the first tweet that I posted with anxiety at least,

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.120
I don't know, there way a way
I could kinda like make it like a

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.960
fun, like, relatable type of thing...

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.600
it just feels like the sort of thing you need to do

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.520
which shouldn't be the way that it
is but that was my feeling initially.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.540
Whereas with depression...
it's just not fun to go through that at all.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.480
There's no way to share that and be like...

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.160
but we're getting through, guys,
and everything's gunna be fine.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.980
You just feel like shit, and...

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.820
then you get through eventually, but...

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.880
that's not the kind of thing that people
wanna hear a lot of the time, I don't think.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.960
It has only been recently that I've been like,
formally diagnosed with these.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.160
And to be honest the first time
I went to see a doctor about it

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.900
I kind of got, like, brushed off.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.140
He was like, eh, this probably isn't a bit deal so...

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.540
maybe go and see a therapist if you can but, I dunno.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.300
And that didn't really feel right to me,
so I went to a different doctor and, uh,

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.180
she formally diagnosed me
with anxiety and depression.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.520
And I'm on medication for it as well now.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.920
Personally, I don't feel like I could
get by if I was just taking medication.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.320
I also see a therapist.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.320
I also try and do things that
I know will make me feel better.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.480
But it's, you know, it's a case of whatever works for you.
I don't feel like I would ever-

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.800
like it's images like this one that you
see and you're just like, well, come on!

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:34.300
Yes, like, sometimes for me going out on a walk
in the nature acts as an anti-depressant, sure!

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.220
It doesn't always work like that. But I also need
to take medication to reach a certain baseline.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.200
But that's just me personally... whatever.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.360
The one thing that medication
really did help me realise though

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.980
was that it was an illness.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.480
It was a very kind of physical way of being like,
you are taking a pill for an issue that you have.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.860
So it's not a part of you.
And separating those two things,

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.340
me from the illness,
was very important for me personally.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.340
When I posted the tweets initially I think the thing that I

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.040
thought I was doing was letting other people know...

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.020
hey, this is a problem that I have,
so if you have it too we can go through this together.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.940
I thought that I was doing it to
try and like help other people.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.000
But what actually happened was
that I just got a really big outpouring

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.640
of support from people on twitter that, um,
I kind of haven't experienced in a while.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.220
And, um, it genuinely made me feel better.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.140
I think part of this is just wanting to really
try and be as honest and authentic as I can.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.620
I still kind of really believe that that's important,

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.140
especially kind of on YouTube these
days where I feel like a lot of people

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.420
do have this weird kind of
like manufactured authenticity.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.760
Like it's like a phoney version of feeling
like you're connecting with someone.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.080
And I don't like that. I kind of want to rail against that.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.940
Even if it does mean I bum people out,
I just really wanna be like...

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.000
this is real. This is who I am.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.700
Anyway, I'm in Toronto. That's what this is.
I'm in an Airbnb right now.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.680
Last time I was here I actually, uh,
had some real problems with my anxiety.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.980
I remember once, I-
all I had to do was go out and get lunch,

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.160
and it took me like a good hour of,
like, sitting and like hyperventilating.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.480
What are all of the thing that could possibly
go wrong if I go out and get some lunch?

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.600
If I go to a resturant I haven't been to before?

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.460
It's like, yeah, rationally it doesn't make any sense.

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.740
But, for me at the time, it was, like, genuinely terrifying.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.240
And I was worried about that happening again, but

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.500
I have definitely found that I am improving.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.860
I've been out multiple times
while I've been here to get lunch.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.860
Although it has been nerve-racking,

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.760
it has not been as bad as it
has been the last time I was here.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.620
That's maybe the positive I can
end this on to make you feel like,

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.040
"Eh! Everything's going to be alright!"

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.100
I hope it will be, but um, you know we'll- we'll see.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.180
I'm just doing my best.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.060
And, uh, yeah.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.280
If you're going through similar things as well,
I feel ya. I really do.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.160
And yeah, sorry that this was a rambly mess,
but I couldn't really...

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.860
this felt like the right way to do it.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.760
Hope you have a great day, uh and

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.500
I'll see you in the next one of these,
whenever that might be.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.720
Who know these days, eh?

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.200
Thanks for watching. Bye, guys.
