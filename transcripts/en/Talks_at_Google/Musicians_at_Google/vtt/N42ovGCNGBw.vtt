[MUSIC - GRACE KELLY]

00:03:36.566 --> 00:03:39.061
[CHEERING]

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:44.554
SPEAKER 1: Do we have
room for one more?

00:03:44.554 --> 00:03:45.970
Grace Kelly, ladies
and gentlemen.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:46.460
GRACE KELLY: Thank you.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.960
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.360
SPEAKER 1: And your
colleagues and friends.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.004
Putting our music
room to very good use.

00:03:55.004 --> 00:03:57.027
I think there's a--
oh, You have it.

00:03:57.027 --> 00:03:58.235
GRACE KELLY: Yeah, I got one.

00:03:58.235 --> 00:03:59.240
SPEAKER 1: It's my
honor and pleasure

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.040
to introduce you to
Grace a little bit more,

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.490
get to know her.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:02.990
If you haven't heard
of Grace Kelly,

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.546
then you haven't
traveled on the T today.

00:04:05.546 --> 00:04:07.470
"Improper Bostonian"
just came out.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.511
GRACE KELLY: Yeah, today.

00:04:08.511 --> 00:04:10.140
SPEAKER 1: Just today.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.500
You are incredibly,
incredibly busy.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.230
And you do a lot of
diversified things.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.370
GRACE KELLY: Yeah.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.339
SPEAKER 1: You're originally
from Boston, moved to LA, now

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.940
in New York.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:20.160
GRACE KELLY: Yes.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.790
SPEAKER 1: But Boston this week.

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:22.516
Why?

00:04:22.516 --> 00:04:24.140
GRACE KELLY: So
yesterday-- is this on?

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.650
This cool?

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.200
You can hear?

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.670
So yesterday-- I'm part of this
documentary about a mentor--

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:32.540
now it's on.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.240
I'm part of a documentary about
a mentor of mine in music.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.850
He passed away, but he's
the late, great saxophonist

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.140
Frank Morgan.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.580
And he was a protégé of the
bebop saxophonist and the king,

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.830
Mr. Charlie Parker.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.860
Frank was asked to join
Duke Ellington's orchestra

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.100
when he was 18.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.790
But he couldn't because his
parents said he was too young.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.748
And he should be one of
those jazz saxophonists

00:04:54.748 --> 00:04:57.020
that everyone knows,
but he spent 30 years

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.700
in and out of San
Quentin due to drugs.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.717
So this is a documentary
about his life.

00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:03.050
And I got to know him in the
last two years of his life.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.050
And we were very close.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.716
We played a lot.

00:05:04.716 --> 00:05:07.330
So that premiered
in Boston at the--

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.220
in Brookline at the Brookline
Coolidge Corner Theatre.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.090
And it was exciting.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.810
So that's why I'm here.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.476
Because it's played
at the LA Film Fest.

00:05:13.476 --> 00:05:14.360
It's played all over.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.837
But that was its first
screening in the area.

00:05:17.837 --> 00:05:19.670
SPEAKER 1: But you'll
also be back in Boston

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:20.010
at the end of the month.

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.060
GRACE KELLY: I will.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.320
So May 22, Sunday May
22, you can put it down

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.570
in your Google Calendars.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.670
I will be at the Berklee
Performance Center

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.460
with a fantastic band of mine.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.970
And we're going to be
celebrating my new CD.

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.240
And it's going to be a
multimedia, visual thing

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.070
and really cool.

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.250
So I hope you guys can come.

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:41.674
It's going to be lots of fun.

00:05:41.674 --> 00:05:42.590
SPEAKER 1: Incredible.

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.570
So a new CD.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:45.320
GRACE KELLY: Yeah.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.060
SPEAKER 1: Is this
with a regular band?

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.670
GRACE KELLY: So
this CD has probably

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.780
20-plus musicians on it--
including special guest

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.434
Jon Batiste sings and
plays harmoni-board on it.

00:05:57.434 --> 00:05:59.600
Michael League, who's the
founder of the band Snarky

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.890
Puppy and plays
bass in that band,

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.040
Shayna Steele, Mocean Worker.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.910
But there's a lot of cats,
including band members of mine

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.340
and then just other
incredible musicians

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.579
that added their talents to it.

00:06:12.579 --> 00:06:14.120
SPEAKER 1: And is
this all originals,

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.440
or is there a mix of
originals and standards?

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.320
GRACE KELLY: It's a mix of it.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.782
There's a good
amount of originals.

00:06:17.782 --> 00:06:19.740
And then there's some of
my favorite standards.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.920
And it's kind of a
thematic CD in the way

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.140
that from the first
track to the last track,

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.210
it goes from
darkness into light.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.060
I called it an emotional
musical journey.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.360
And every song kind of
uncovers more of that.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.311
So that's how I picked
the songs that I wanted.

00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:37.310
SPEAKER 1: So then will
you be touring elsewhere

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.110
to support the album?

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.859
GRACE KELLY: Yeah.

00:06:38.859 --> 00:06:40.282
So I've been doing--

00:06:40.282 --> 00:06:42.740
we're going to be doing some
stuff in the West Coast coming

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:43.240
up.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.630
And we have some gigs.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.464
I've been doing this gig
with Jon Batiste playing

00:06:47.464 --> 00:06:49.130
on "The Late Show
with Stephen Colbert."

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.800
So that's like an everyday
thing Monday through Friday.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.240
So it's been a little bit
tricky to figure out how

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.610
to kind of get it all together.

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.360
But they've been super
flexible in letting

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.190
me go off and perform.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.350
Like today, they were
like, OK, go do your thing.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.624
And then I drive back
to New York tonight,

00:07:05.624 --> 00:07:07.040
and then I'm on
the show tomorrow.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.880
SPEAKER 1: Wow.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.680
GRACE KELLY: So yeah, it's--

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.110
that came up so last
minute for me in December

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:14.490
that it's just been a juggling
act now of being like, OK,

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.459
how can we fit in all
of these great things?

00:07:16.459 --> 00:07:17.750
SPEAKER 1: Gosh, I can imagine.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.540
So then-- but that's not the
only way we'll see you on TV,

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.110
right?

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.901
GRACE KELLY: Right.

00:07:21.901 --> 00:07:24.860
So I was asked in May--

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.980
I think the premier
is May 31, right?

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.690
On NBC, there's
a new show called

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:31.640
"Maya &amp; Marty in Manhattan."

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.250
And it's Martin Short
and Maya Rudolph.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.999
It's kind of an updated
Carol Burnett variety show.

00:07:36.999 --> 00:07:38.790
And I was asked to be
in the band for that.

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.300
So I'm hopping over
to Rockefeller Center

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:41.940
to record that.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:42.020
SPEAKER 1: Sweet.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.311
GRACE KELLY: And that's going
to be six episodes, right

00:07:44.311 --> 00:07:45.995
after "America's
Got Talent" on NBC.

00:07:45.995 --> 00:07:47.030
So you can tune in.

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:49.250
The first episode
will be May 31.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:53.000
And it's supposed to be a lot
of musical guests and comedians,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.245
so I'm guessing it's
going to be really fun.

00:07:55.245 --> 00:07:57.620
SPEAKER 1: But then you're
also on an Amazon show, right?

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.330
GRACE KELLY: Yes, I am.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.390
Yeah, it's been a TV
year, which is great.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:03.181
SPEAKER 1: I'm exhausted
just [INAUDIBLE]..

00:08:03.181 --> 00:08:06.110
GRACE KELLY: So some of you
might know the great "New York

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.510
Times" best-selling
author Michael Connelly.

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:10.790
And he writes these
detective novels.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.620
One of them is
about Harry Bosch.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.080
I mean he's written
20-something books about him.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.170
And it got turned into a TV show
that Amazon Prime picked up.

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:20.180
So season one was
super successful.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.080
People loved it.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.580
It's so well-done.

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:26.450
And then in season two,
it features my band

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:30.032
and me playing in front of the
main character Harry Bosch.

00:08:30.032 --> 00:08:31.490
And I'm playing a
song that I wrote

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:33.365
for him called "Blues
for Harry Bosch," which

00:08:33.365 --> 00:08:34.760
is the first track on the CD.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.340
And so that came out March
11, the whole season.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.710
And it's very binge
watching worthy.

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:42.140
And they just got the green
light for season three too.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.020
But it came about--

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:46.790
Michael Connelly, the
author, wrote an email to me.

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:49.346
And he said, hey, I wrote a
part for you in our TV show.

00:08:49.346 --> 00:08:51.220
Any chance that you
would want to come do it?

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.630
I was like, hmm, let me check.

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.270
Yeah, I'm free.

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:56.680
I'm very free.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.620
SPEAKER 1: You have to
clear it with Colbert.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:58.746
But otherwise, you're free.

00:08:58.746 --> 00:08:59.578
So it's interesting.

00:08:59.578 --> 00:09:00.990
So you work with
Stephen Colbert.

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:01.470
GRACE KELLY: Yeah.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.410
SPEAKER 1: And you're doing this
show with Martin Short and Maya

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:03.590
Rudolph.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:04.340
GRACE KELLY: Yeah.

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.590
SPEAKER 1: All master
improvisers in comedy.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:07.100
GRACE KELLY: Yeah, totally.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.155
SPEAKER 1: You yourself a
master improviser in music.

00:09:09.155 --> 00:09:09.988
GRACE KELLY: Thanks.

00:09:09.988 --> 00:09:12.710
SPEAKER 1: Now what
is that relationship?

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:14.770
Do you get to collaborate
improvisationally

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:15.660
with these folks?

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.100
What is that relationship like?

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.975
GRACE KELLY: Well, it's
just super fun for me

00:09:18.975 --> 00:09:20.720
because I love the
spontaneity of jazz.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.660
And like the fact that
we all just got together

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.120
this afternoon and playing
music that we didn't even

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:30.164
rehearse before today, that's
kind of how Stephen operates.

00:09:30.164 --> 00:09:30.830
It's really fun.

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:32.632
Like certain
moments in the show,

00:09:32.632 --> 00:09:35.090
you might not see it because
it's during commercial breaks.

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:37.700
But for the live audience,
he'll come over to the band.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.310
And he'll start singing
and dancing with us

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:42.590
or just go over to the
piano and start playing.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:46.100
And so it's just the mentality
behind these great comedians

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.090
with the musicians.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:49.250
We're all from the same
language, which I love.

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.341
So it just makes everything
feel much more fluid.

00:09:51.341 --> 00:09:53.090
SPEAKER 1: And then
according to your bio,

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:56.360
you say that not only do you
use improvisational techniques

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.935
or mindset in your music, but
also in the rest of your life.

00:09:58.935 --> 00:09:59.810
GRACE KELLY: Totally.

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:01.226
SPEAKER 1: Can you
give an example

00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:05.400
of some non-musical-related
incident or anything where

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.680
improvisation helped you?

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:07.680
GRACE KELLY: Yeah, yeah.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.590
I mean I think it's
really important--

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:12.260
since I've been studying jazz
and studying improvisation,

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.420
it just kind of
creeps into my life.

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:17.390
And sometimes I'm way more
laid back about situations

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:18.750
than I probably should be.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:20.870
But it's just how
I've been trained.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.760
But there was this
one time years

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.940
ago that I was supposed to go to
the Apollo Theater in New York

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.480
City to go see a show that
featured all the jazz greats.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.480
Like Dave Brubeck was
there, Wynton Marsalis.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.330
The woman putting on the concert
was like, yeah, you can get in.

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:36.620
I'll get you backstage.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.152
So I was super excited.

00:10:38.152 --> 00:10:39.860
And then last minute,
she said, actually,

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.100
all the tickets are sold out.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.650
And we can't get you in.

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:46.250
And so maybe the
non-improvising Grace

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:48.480
would be like, oh shoot,
and just super bummed out,

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.620
and go to my hotel, and
eat Twizzlers and be sad.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.047
But I was with one of
my mentors that night.

00:10:54.047 --> 00:10:56.380
And he said, well, why don't
we go to Roth's Steakhouse.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.880
There's a great
trio playing nearby.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.520
So I was like, OK, cool.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.410
So we went to Roth's.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:01.700
And I had my horn with me.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.510
And the pianist
playing said, hey,

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:05.720
why don't you come
sit in with the band?

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:06.480
He was great.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.440
The trio was awesome.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.080
And then he said, why
don't you stick around

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:09.871
for the second set?

00:11:09.871 --> 00:11:11.480
And we have a
trumpeter coming in.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.045
Is it OK if he sits
in with us too?

00:11:13.045 --> 00:11:13.920
I'm like, sure, cool.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.440
It's your gig.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.460
And then who walks in?

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.495
The trumpeter is Wynton
Marsalis to Roth's Steakhouse--

00:11:19.495 --> 00:11:21.620
in front of like 10 people
who probably didn't even

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:24.036
know who he was because they're
just eating steaks and not

00:11:24.036 --> 00:11:24.980
paying attention.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.914
We played a whole
second set together.

00:11:26.914 --> 00:11:28.580
And then like a week
later, I got a call

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.260
from his people being
like, would Grace

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:34.020
be a guest with Wynton's Jazz
at Lincoln Center Orchestra

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.780
at Rose Hall for three nights?

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:38.570
And that was kind of a case
of really going with the flow.

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:41.932
And something way better
and amazing happened.

00:11:41.932 --> 00:11:43.140
SPEAKER 1: That's so awesome.

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:43.540
GRACE KELLY: Yeah.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.140
SPEAKER 1: I want to
get back to the music

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:46.910
because there's a lot
more music coming.

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:47.120
GRACE KELLY: Yeah.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.078
SPEAKER 1: But I just--

00:11:48.078 --> 00:11:50.999
it's really impressive to
kind of run down your history

00:11:50.999 --> 00:11:52.790
because you wrote your
first song at seven.

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:53.480
GRACE KELLY: Yeah.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.430
SPEAKER 1: You recorded
your first record at 12.

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.910
GRACE KELLY: Yes.

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:58.250
SPEAKER 1: You wrote an entire
arrangement for the Boston Pops

00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:58.880
at 14.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:11:59.450
GRACE KELLY: Right.

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:01.860
SPEAKER 1: And you played at
Obama's inauguration at 16.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:02.580
GRACE KELLY: I'm tired.

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.080
Phew.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.190
That's a lot of stuff.

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.900
SPEAKER 1: Again.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.160
That's whee-- And it's hard
to read anything about you

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.480
without seeing the term prodigy
kind of following you around.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.330
GRACE KELLY: Right.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.350
SPEAKER 1: And I wonder
what your relationship

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:13.031
is to that word.

00:12:13.031 --> 00:12:14.780
How do you feel now
that you're a grownup?

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:19.010
You're in the same industry
as many other adults?

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:20.960
Is that something
that you have a mixed

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.700
relationship with that word?

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.515
Or how has it been to
be a child in jazz?

00:12:25.515 --> 00:12:27.140
GRACE KELLY: It's
funny because I never

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:28.289
put that word upon myself.

00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:30.830
And it was funny when that word
just started floating around.

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:33.810
I mean I remember the first time
I saw it, it was like, what?

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:35.510
I'm not a prodigy.

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:39.430
It's just something that I found
early on, had amazing teachers,

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:41.870
and was lucky to
find a passion that I

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:43.580
was good at from an early age.

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:46.620
But I guess that's what the
outside world was calling me.

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:48.600
So I never took
it too seriously.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.050
But then I did end up
hearing the word quite a lot.

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:54.680
So I think I have many
feelings with the word.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.050
I'm very glad that
I started young

00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:00.080
and was able to
have people start

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.292
to know about my music and
all that from a young age.

00:13:02.292 --> 00:13:04.000
And then at the same
time, I kind of just

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.579
figure I was just practicing,
and doing my thing,

00:13:07.579 --> 00:13:10.120
and trying to work really hard
as I continue to do every day.

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:14.600
And that's-- yeah, call
it whatever you want.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.920
SPEAKER 1: And your
musicianship speaks for itself.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:17.340
So there you go.

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:17.870
GRACE KELLY: Yeah, exactly.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:18.300
Right.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.216
SPEAKER 1: And let's let
it do that some more.

00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:23.607
So Grace Kelly and
the G CAM All Stars.

00:13:23.607 --> 00:13:24.440
Give it up for them.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:24.981
Look at that.

00:13:24.981 --> 00:13:25.930
Innovators issue.

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:27.550
Let's have that word.

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:30.305
GRACE KELLY: I met Diego last
time I was here at Google.

00:13:30.305 --> 00:13:33.445
I played with them
in the cafeteria.

00:13:33.445 --> 00:13:35.570
Now you have this
incredible theater,

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:41.724
which I was saying to Bob is
nicer than a lot of jazz clubs.

00:13:41.724 --> 00:13:43.140
It would be-- jazz
musicians would

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:48.350
be so excited if this got in the
roster of the performing tours.

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:50.090
But anyways, this
next song is Diego's.

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:52.742
So do you want to say
anything about it?

00:13:52.742 --> 00:13:53.450
SPEAKER 2: Enjoy.

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:56.444
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:05.925 --> 00:14:08.919
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:21.912 --> 00:18:24.407
[CHEERING]

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:27.980
GRACE KELLY: Diego's rumba.

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.430
[APPLAUSE]
