The worst.

They are --

00:00:13.412 --> 00:00:14.881 align:start size:56% position:44%
Let's rank them.

Are they worse than
anybody else in show business,

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.252 align:start size:56% position:44%
or what's worse?

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:20.620 size:81% position:41%
Morning deejays are worse.

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:23.389 size:84% position:58% line:85%
Morning deejays, magicians.

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:23.389 align:start size:91% position:9%
Then magicians.

Where do mimes fit into that?

00:00:25.424 --> 00:00:27.126 size:66% position:33%
Mimes aren't
in show business.

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:28.494 align:start size:97% position:3%
Mimes are buskers.

00:00:28.527 --> 00:00:29.962 align:start size:50% position:50%
I like that.

00:00:29.995 --> 00:00:31.297 size:59% position:70%
Well, I got to have
a little of this

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.498 size:59% position:70%
to help me decide
this one.

00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:34.267 size:78% position:39%

I'm thinking, so help me out.

All right.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.177
There were some
critical moments in this case.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.480 size:72% position:36%
First of all, Dorian --
He admitted --

00:00:47.513 --> 00:00:48.815 size:88% position:56%
He said the word "borrowed."

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:49.816 align:start size:97% position:3%
He said "borrowed."

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:50.950 align:start size:72% position:28%
"I borrowed that shit."

00:00:50.983 --> 00:00:51.984 align:start size:78% position:22% line:92%
Yeah.

00:00:50.983 --> 00:00:51.984 align:start size:47% position:53%
He said it.

00:00:52.017 --> 00:00:53.686 align:start position:0% line:85%

...Rob said that
he stole it from the other dude.

00:00:56.288 --> 00:00:57.690 size:81% position:41%
But then he said it's okay

00:00:57.723 --> 00:00:59.692 size:63% position:31%
'cause as soon
as it's published,

00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:01.494 size:75% position:38%
then you can just do it.

00:01:01.527 --> 00:01:04.030 size:84% position:42%
But if it was published,
then Dorian can just do it.

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:05.131 align:start size:44% position:56%
Exactly.

5,000 bucks seems
like a lot to me.

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:14.707 align:start size:78% position:22%
To ask?

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.642 size:63% position:69%
To say,
"Yeah, I want $5,000

00:01:16.675 --> 00:01:18.010 align:start size:78% position:22%
'cause he took my trick."

00:01:18.043 --> 00:01:19.045 size:84% position:42%
Also,
I looked at these drawings.

00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:20.980 size:72% position:64%
Is that a $5,000 sketch
right there?

00:01:21.013 --> 00:01:22.348 align:start size:72% position:28%
No.

00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:25.218 size:69% position:34%
The drawings
do not fully represent

what I saw Dorian doing.

00:01:26.552 --> 00:01:28.354 size:69% position:66%

I don't remember
what the other thing was.
