00:00:00.752 --> 00:00:03.151
- On the sleepy coast of Kep, Cambodia,

00:00:03.151 --> 00:00:05.893
you'll find one of the
world's best crab markets.

00:00:05.893 --> 00:00:08.113
To eat like a local, you choose your crab

00:00:08.113 --> 00:00:10.140
directly from ocean baskets,

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.091
boil them from right before your eyes,

00:00:12.091 --> 00:00:15.292
and feast on all you can
eat crab within the market.

00:00:15.292 --> 00:00:18.633
If you love crab, this is
the Cambodian food trip

00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:21.111
where your dreams will come to life.

00:00:21.111 --> 00:00:23.797
Now that is what you
call a crab steam room.

00:00:23.797 --> 00:00:26.644
I was just bathed in crab steam.

00:00:26.644 --> 00:00:29.894
(easy listening music)

00:00:31.317 --> 00:00:33.355
Good morning. Hope you're
having an amazing day.

00:00:33.355 --> 00:00:35.704
It's Mark Wiens in Phnom Penh, Cambodia

00:00:35.704 --> 00:00:38.678
and today, we're taking
a day trip to a coast,

00:00:38.678 --> 00:00:41.974
to a place called Kep,
and it's famous for crab.

00:00:41.974 --> 00:00:44.306
So we're gonna go on a
crab road trip today,

00:00:44.306 --> 00:00:47.397
and then coming back, we're
gonna go visit a pepper farm.

00:00:47.397 --> 00:00:49.159
This is gonna be an amazing day trip.

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:51.966
And I can't wait to share it with you.

00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:55.216
(easy listening music)

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.133
We just made it to Kep.

00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:18.647
It's actually not that
far away, but it took us

00:01:18.647 --> 00:01:21.444
almost a little bit over
three hours because the road

00:01:21.444 --> 00:01:24.041
conditions are not extremely good.

00:01:24.041 --> 00:01:26.310
And the road moves
pretty slow, and there's

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.440
occasional cows and dogs
that cross the road.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.801
And plenty of obstructions,
but we made it.

00:01:30.801 --> 00:01:32.483
We drove to straight to the local market.

00:01:32.483 --> 00:01:34.289
And as soon as you step out of the car,

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:38.286
you can just, this waft
of smoking grilled seafood

00:01:38.286 --> 00:01:39.742
hits your nose.

00:01:39.742 --> 00:01:41.510
It's a little bit of a makeshift market

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.891
and located right along the ocean front.

00:01:43.891 --> 00:01:46.801
You can smell all the smoke
from the grilling seafood.

00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:49.218
And whoa, lots of squid here.

00:01:50.941 --> 00:01:53.171
But I want to go straight
to the pier first

00:01:53.171 --> 00:01:55.338
to see the crab situation.

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:59.346
(percussive music)

00:02:03.413 --> 00:02:06.406
Wow, this is such an amazing environment,

00:02:06.406 --> 00:02:08.342
such an awesome market.

00:02:08.342 --> 00:02:10.745
Right along the ocean,
and actually I'm standing

00:02:10.745 --> 00:02:12.041
on this deck right now.

00:02:12.041 --> 00:02:14.310
There are just baskets
and baskets of crabs.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.438
They actually grab the
crabs right out of the water

00:02:16.438 --> 00:02:20.114
and they sell them right here on the bank.

00:02:20.114 --> 00:02:24.984
People are here just bargaining
for crabs, fresh crabs.

00:02:24.984 --> 00:02:27.817
(water splashing)

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:37.356
- [Woman] (Speaks in foreign language).

00:02:42.347 --> 00:02:44.375
- So you just gotta come
in here and start digging

00:02:44.375 --> 00:02:46.610
through the crab baskets and there

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.271
are just so many crabs.

00:02:48.271 --> 00:02:49.414
We're trying to look for the big size.

00:02:49.414 --> 00:02:50.539
- [Woman] (Speaks in foreign language).

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:51.721
- (Speaks in foreign language).

00:02:51.721 --> 00:02:55.281
- Oh yeah, look at this guy,
small body but huge pinchers.

00:02:55.281 --> 00:02:56.789
Check that out.

00:02:56.789 --> 00:03:00.788
Okay, and this is oh, okay,
another thing I want to show you

00:03:00.788 --> 00:03:03.402
is that you gotta tell
the difference between

00:03:03.402 --> 00:03:05.182
a male and a female.

00:03:05.182 --> 00:03:06.952
This one I think is a male
crab, because of that,

00:03:06.952 --> 00:03:08.199
it's called an apron.

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:09.533
- One kilo eight dollars.

00:03:09.533 --> 00:03:10.597
- [Man] Eight dollars.

00:03:10.597 --> 00:03:11.545
How about six dollars?

00:03:11.545 --> 00:03:12.378
- Six dollars.

00:03:12.378 --> 00:03:13.211
- No, no.

00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:14.863
- (Speaks in foreign language).

00:03:14.863 --> 00:03:16.473
- (Mumbles).

00:03:16.473 --> 00:03:18.551
- [Man] Okay seven dollars?

00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:19.555
- [Woman] No no no.

00:03:19.555 --> 00:03:22.249
- Crab as fresh as you can possibly get.

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:23.257
- Two kilo.

00:03:23.257 --> 00:03:24.744
- Okay, that's exactly two kilos.

00:03:24.744 --> 00:03:26.460
- [Man] Looks like (mumbles).

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.744
- [Man] (Speaks in foreign language).

00:03:28.744 --> 00:03:31.302
- [Woman] (Speaks in foreign language).

00:03:31.302 --> 00:03:34.765
- Okay (speaks in foreign language).

00:03:34.765 --> 00:03:37.963
That was an energetic situation
but it was pretty fun.

00:03:37.963 --> 00:03:40.260
You just kind of come over here.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.606
You talk to some of the vendors.

00:03:41.606 --> 00:03:43.499
They give you a price and
from what I understand,

00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:45.691
the price really really
fluctuates between the day.

00:03:45.691 --> 00:03:48.225
So it's kind of hard to know
the exact price of the day.

00:03:48.225 --> 00:03:50.744
Today it was eight dollars per kilo.

00:03:50.744 --> 00:03:52.321
And you can bargain.

00:03:52.321 --> 00:03:53.897
We got it to seven dollars per kilo.

00:03:53.897 --> 00:03:57.240
There's a lady cooking right
here on the ocean front.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.407
Let's see if she can cook these crabs.

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.746
(percussive music)

00:04:06.975 --> 00:04:11.142
- [Woman] (Speaks in foreign language).

00:04:12.884 --> 00:04:14.472
- This is absolutely amazing.

00:04:14.472 --> 00:04:17.339
They take the crabs,
they put them into a pot.

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:20.298
Oh, as soon as they're done
boiling, then just drop

00:04:20.298 --> 00:04:22.776
them into a big basket and let them steam.

00:04:22.776 --> 00:04:25.098
And then drop them into a bag.

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:28.187
Oh, that's just fresh boiled crab.

00:04:28.187 --> 00:04:31.718
It's amazing, the smell
of the wood fire smoke

00:04:31.718 --> 00:04:35.166
mixed with the fresh
crab and the sea breeze.

00:04:35.166 --> 00:04:38.822
This is a perfect crab
eating atmosphere here.

00:04:38.822 --> 00:04:43.249
So now you just kind of sit
around and wait and just hold on

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:45.203
and wait for your crab to finish boiling.

00:04:45.203 --> 00:04:48.431
That puff of crab stream, oh wow.

00:04:48.431 --> 00:04:52.431
- (Speaks in foreign language).

00:05:02.242 --> 00:05:04.524
- [Woman] (Speaks in foreign language).

00:05:04.524 --> 00:05:06.160
- Now only only is this a crab paradise

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.458
but you can step over to another stall.

00:05:08.458 --> 00:05:10.680
And just find an abundance of seafood.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.456
There's so much squid.

00:05:12.456 --> 00:05:14.240
There's lot of different types of fish.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.632
And we ordered up a, you can
just kind of pick and choose.

00:05:16.632 --> 00:05:17.838
They grill them.

00:05:17.838 --> 00:05:19.852
And if you order them, then
you put them back on the grill

00:05:19.852 --> 00:05:22.157
for a little while to heat them again.

00:05:22.157 --> 00:05:25.324
And she has so many good looking fish.

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:30.954
Once you finish the mission
of buying all of your seafood

00:05:30.954 --> 00:05:35.307
and getting cooked, next step
is to buy rice and sauce.

00:05:35.307 --> 00:05:38.229
And I love how they put the
sauce in old water bottles.

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:39.693
There's red sauce, there's green sauce.

00:05:39.693 --> 00:05:40.783
But she said that the
green sauce is spicier,

00:05:40.783 --> 00:05:42.526
so we went with the green sauce.

00:05:42.526 --> 00:05:44.723
And the sauce just completes the meal.

00:05:44.723 --> 00:05:47.144
We got all the seafood and you
just come back to the market.

00:05:47.144 --> 00:05:49.450
You can take it all to go
and you can sit somewhere

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:50.786
or you can eat it within the market.

00:05:50.786 --> 00:05:52.491
And you just go to to
one of the drink stalls.

00:05:52.491 --> 00:05:54.006
And they have tables set up.

00:05:54.006 --> 00:05:56.298
You just order drinks and
you can sit at the table

00:05:56.298 --> 00:05:58.948
and devour all of the seafood.

00:05:58.948 --> 00:06:03.038
One of the best gift opening
sessions I've ever had.

00:06:03.038 --> 00:06:05.789
What a just a stunning fish market

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:08.972
seafood devouring environment.

00:06:08.972 --> 00:06:11.597
They even gave us a plate
so we can pile all the crabs

00:06:11.597 --> 00:06:12.776
onto the plate.

00:06:12.776 --> 00:06:15.353
Look at this pile of freshly boiled crabs.

00:06:15.353 --> 00:06:18.552
And they've got the
different types of fish here.

00:06:18.552 --> 00:06:21.681
We've got the bottles
of sauce and we've got

00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:23.400
some rice to accompany it.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.066
We got to begin with crab.

00:06:25.066 --> 00:06:27.542
I'm gonna go for this guy
right here on the top.

00:06:27.542 --> 00:06:28.542
Grab a crab.

00:06:29.512 --> 00:06:32.691
What I love about these
crabs is that their bodies

00:06:32.691 --> 00:06:36.721
are pretty small, but then
those claws are just huge.

00:06:36.721 --> 00:06:39.446
And don't eat the rubber
band, break off the claw.

00:06:39.446 --> 00:06:42.327
We're gonna do a lot of crunching
and munching in this meal.

00:06:42.327 --> 00:06:43.778
I think they're blue swimmer crabs.

00:06:43.778 --> 00:06:45.214
But what's cool about
these crabs is that they're

00:06:45.214 --> 00:06:47.227
really easy to pluck open on your own

00:06:47.227 --> 00:06:49.611
just with your fingers or with your mouth,

00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:52.436
you can crack them and just
kind of break the shells

00:06:52.436 --> 00:06:53.769
are really soft.

00:06:55.672 --> 00:06:57.005
Oh yes. Alright.

00:06:58.805 --> 00:07:01.738
Okay, cheers, (mumbles).

00:07:01.738 --> 00:07:04.635
(pop music)

00:07:04.635 --> 00:07:05.635
Hmm, oh wow.

00:07:07.572 --> 00:07:10.905
The freshness just lights up your mouth.

00:07:11.851 --> 00:07:14.034
(laughing)

00:07:14.034 --> 00:07:16.173
Nuggets just pop out.

00:07:16.173 --> 00:07:17.941
Oh thank you very much.

00:07:17.941 --> 00:07:18.944
- Thank you.

00:07:18.944 --> 00:07:19.964
- Thank you.

00:07:19.964 --> 00:07:22.192
Just nuggets of crab
just slide out with ease

00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:24.250
like you're pulling a
knife out of a sheath.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:27.159
(pop music)

00:07:27.159 --> 00:07:29.589
Oh wow. You can see
that they're male crabs.

00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:32.715
I think what you do is
you removed the apron

00:07:32.715 --> 00:07:34.536
and then you can turn it around.

00:07:34.536 --> 00:07:36.278
Take off the top of the shell here,

00:07:36.278 --> 00:07:38.652
and that removes the whole head and eyes

00:07:38.652 --> 00:07:40.303
and top shell, and then from here,

00:07:40.303 --> 00:07:43.184
what's easiest to do is
just break it in half.

00:07:43.184 --> 00:07:44.774
Just break it in half like that,

00:07:44.774 --> 00:07:47.298
and then, because these
are male crabs, they're

00:07:47.298 --> 00:07:48.991
mostly meat on the inside.

00:07:48.991 --> 00:07:51.766
Although there's a little
big of (mumbles) I believe.

00:07:51.766 --> 00:07:54.742
And you should have
little drumsticks of oh,

00:07:54.742 --> 00:07:56.825
just popping oozing crab.

00:08:00.834 --> 00:08:03.665
It's just unbelievably juicy.

00:08:03.665 --> 00:08:08.626
Oh, that is some of the juiciest
crab I've had in my life.

00:08:08.626 --> 00:08:11.357
One crab down, let's move
into the fish, the trio.

00:08:11.357 --> 00:08:13.524
Stingray skin is very, very thick.

00:08:13.524 --> 00:08:16.752
Oh, look how stringy
that meat is down there.

00:08:16.752 --> 00:08:18.827
Check out that. It looks
like it's chicken breast.

00:08:18.827 --> 00:08:22.994
That is just pulled into
strings of chicken breast.

00:08:25.368 --> 00:08:28.666
It really is like chicken but softer

00:08:28.666 --> 00:08:31.040
and a little more juicy.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.077
Okay, that's really good, but this fish

00:08:34.077 --> 00:08:36.767
would be better with a
little bit of sauce in it

00:08:36.767 --> 00:08:38.361
because it's pretty plain tasting.

00:08:38.361 --> 00:08:40.021
I'm gonna dump sauce into this side

00:08:40.021 --> 00:08:41.786
of my styrofoam container.

00:08:41.786 --> 00:08:44.419
And then we also got some of the red sauce

00:08:44.419 --> 00:08:46.290
which she gave us on
the bottom of the bottle

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:49.316
to eat with the fish over here.

00:08:49.316 --> 00:08:53.483
Oh yeah, it's so fleshy,
it's just like solid meat.

00:08:56.366 --> 00:09:00.948
Okay, the stingray is
really enhanced with sauce.

00:09:00.948 --> 00:09:02.929
Peel back, oh you peel back that skin

00:09:02.929 --> 00:09:05.923
and you just got juicy oily fish flesh.

00:09:05.923 --> 00:09:08.256
(pop music)

00:09:14.154 --> 00:09:15.993
Oh that's butter. Oh that texture

00:09:15.993 --> 00:09:17.905
is just completely different.

00:09:17.905 --> 00:09:20.666
It's so oily and you can feel
those omega threes, those

00:09:20.666 --> 00:09:24.833
fatties, those fatty oils
just overwhelming your mouth.

00:09:26.519 --> 00:09:30.686
That fish has this wonderful
textural quality to it.

00:09:31.851 --> 00:09:34.557
And it is time to now
move into another crab.

00:09:34.557 --> 00:09:37.755
For this crab, I'm gonna
try dipping it in a sauce.

00:09:37.755 --> 00:09:40.991
Oh yes, oh look at that, it just slides.

00:09:40.991 --> 00:09:43.396
Oh, it just slides out and splatters

00:09:43.396 --> 00:09:44.944
with a little juice.

00:09:44.944 --> 00:09:47.297
Give it a nice little dunk in the sauce,

00:09:47.297 --> 00:09:49.002
and a bit sized nugget.

00:09:49.002 --> 00:09:51.335
(pop music)

00:09:53.936 --> 00:09:54.769
Oh, okay.

00:09:57.247 --> 00:09:59.055
That is good with the sauce too.

00:09:59.055 --> 00:10:00.875
Definitely very good with the sauce.

00:10:00.875 --> 00:10:03.079
'Cause that's a nice garlicky compliment

00:10:03.079 --> 00:10:06.457
to the incredibly fresh
and incredibly sweet crab.

00:10:06.457 --> 00:10:08.950
This is some of the easiest
crab that I've eaten too.

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:11.275
It's so easy to peel.

00:10:11.275 --> 00:10:15.442
All you do is literally like
you just crack it with ease.

00:10:18.996 --> 00:10:21.579
Oh that is just crab sensation.

00:10:32.497 --> 00:10:37.136
You can literally just
grab fish by the fistful.

00:10:37.136 --> 00:10:39.755
Look at it, that's an
entire fistful of fish.

00:10:39.755 --> 00:10:42.696
And I'm gonna dump this into the sauce.

00:10:42.696 --> 00:10:44.827
Just kind of wipe up the sauce.

00:10:44.827 --> 00:10:48.827
That might actually be
too much for a one biter.

00:10:50.832 --> 00:10:52.165
Or actually not.

00:10:53.396 --> 00:10:55.729
(pop music)

00:11:00.248 --> 00:11:01.643
- [Man] It's so nice and juicy.

00:11:01.643 --> 00:11:02.476
- Hello.

00:11:02.476 --> 00:11:03.643
- [Man] Hello.

00:11:04.519 --> 00:11:06.686
- [Man] So that is creamy.

00:11:10.448 --> 00:11:11.670
- [Man] Oh yeah.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:15.627
- (Speaks in foreign language).

00:11:15.627 --> 00:11:17.738
- [Man] Two kilos of mango.

00:11:17.738 --> 00:11:19.566
- Thank you.

00:11:19.566 --> 00:11:23.733
She's giving me a sample of
the mangosteen right now.

00:11:25.566 --> 00:11:28.566
Oh yeah, oh that's just juicy sweet.

00:11:30.794 --> 00:11:32.889
This might be one of
the more perfect markets

00:11:32.889 --> 00:11:34.474
in the entire world.

00:11:34.474 --> 00:11:37.500
Not only do they have an
unbelievable fresh selection

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:42.190
of crab, and fish, and
seafood, but it is just loaded.

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:44.893
This market is loaded
with durian right now.

00:11:44.893 --> 00:11:47.539
The only thing that I could
possibly want right now

00:11:47.539 --> 00:11:49.932
after that seafood is durian.

00:11:49.932 --> 00:11:54.099
So Gil and I and Ying are all
gonna break durian together.

00:11:56.315 --> 00:11:59.268
- [Woman] (Speaks in foreign language).

00:11:59.268 --> 00:12:00.629
- Ying, how is it?

00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:01.629
- Very good.

00:12:02.721 --> 00:12:05.162
- Oh that is a proper aroma.

00:12:05.162 --> 00:12:07.773
That's how you want durian to smell.

00:12:07.773 --> 00:12:09.940
Okay I can't wait. Cheers.

00:12:13.925 --> 00:12:14.758
Uh hmm.

00:12:16.994 --> 00:12:18.389
Oh wow.

00:12:18.389 --> 00:12:21.123
I might just stay here
on the ground for the

00:12:21.123 --> 00:12:23.282
rest of the afternoon.

00:12:23.282 --> 00:12:26.161
Oh that's like condensed whipped cream

00:12:26.161 --> 00:12:30.161
with a better wine almost
alcoholic taste to it.

00:12:31.871 --> 00:12:35.331
- Amazing. Dude it has been too long.

00:12:35.331 --> 00:12:38.929
I'm happy to break my
durian fast with this one.

00:12:38.929 --> 00:12:42.008
Amazing, Cambodia, Kampot specific,

00:12:42.008 --> 00:12:43.744
Kampot durian is amazing.

00:12:43.744 --> 00:12:46.414
- I ended up going back
to that same fish stall

00:12:46.414 --> 00:12:48.522
to buy one more fish to take
away for dinner tonight.

00:12:48.522 --> 00:12:50.933
We're gonna bring this back
and eat it for dinner tonight.

00:12:50.933 --> 00:12:52.310
But we gotta go now.

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:54.302
We've spent way too long at this market.

00:12:54.302 --> 00:12:57.533
We just got lost in the
maze of seafood and durian.

00:12:57.533 --> 00:12:59.395
(laughing)

00:12:59.395 --> 00:13:00.635
- (Speaks in foreign language).

00:13:00.635 --> 00:13:02.217
Thank you.

00:13:02.217 --> 00:13:04.550
(pop music)

00:13:17.298 --> 00:13:18.812
We have just arrived.

00:13:18.812 --> 00:13:20.339
That was just about a 15 minute drive

00:13:20.339 --> 00:13:23.190
from the center of Kep
and there are a bunch of

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:24.757
pepper farms in this area.

00:13:24.757 --> 00:13:27.280
We came to one that's
called Sothy's Pepper Farm.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.788
But Kampot and Kep, this area of Cambodia

00:13:29.788 --> 00:13:31.920
is known for having the best pepper.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.600
Growing the best pepper
in the entire world.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.616
A lot of people regard it as
the finest quality pepper.

00:13:36.616 --> 00:13:38.481
Whoa, black pepper corns.

00:13:38.481 --> 00:13:40.130
What are these, these are like pickled?

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:42.354
- This is a green pepper like
pickle with crystal salt.

00:13:42.354 --> 00:13:45.206
- Oh that black pepper is incredible.

00:13:45.206 --> 00:13:46.609
- It's like uh--

00:13:46.609 --> 00:13:48.175
- And these are green
pepper corns with some salt.

00:13:48.175 --> 00:13:49.290
- Yeah.

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:50.623
- Okay, oh yeah.

00:13:52.053 --> 00:13:53.898
- Yummy (laughs).

00:13:53.898 --> 00:13:55.995
- Oh it's so good.

00:13:55.995 --> 00:13:57.016
- [Man] This is amazing.

00:13:57.016 --> 00:13:58.234
- Yeah.

00:13:58.234 --> 00:14:00.188
- Oh that's incredibly fragrant.

00:14:00.188 --> 00:14:02.683
There are three main reasons
why Kampot pepper is known

00:14:02.683 --> 00:14:03.989
to be some of the best in the world.

00:14:03.989 --> 00:14:06.454
Number one is because of
the minerals in the soil

00:14:06.454 --> 00:14:08.194
that is natural here in the environment

00:14:08.194 --> 00:14:09.277
and the climate here.

00:14:09.277 --> 00:14:10.294
- Quartz.

00:14:10.294 --> 00:14:11.294
- And this is quartz?

00:14:11.294 --> 00:14:12.426
- Yeah.

00:14:12.426 --> 00:14:14.194
- And the second reason is
there's a whole association.

00:14:14.194 --> 00:14:15.284
- Yeah.

00:14:15.284 --> 00:14:17.577
- Of Kampot pepper growing association

00:14:17.577 --> 00:14:19.212
and they keep the quality high,

00:14:19.212 --> 00:14:20.702
they set the regulations high.

00:14:20.702 --> 00:14:22.558
And then the third reason is
because of the chemical free.

00:14:22.558 --> 00:14:23.586
- [Man] Yeah.

00:14:23.586 --> 00:14:27.688
- So chemical free growing
using natural fertilizers.

00:14:27.688 --> 00:14:30.579
That really is why
Kampot pepper is regarded

00:14:30.579 --> 00:14:32.847
as the best in the world and I've been

00:14:32.847 --> 00:14:35.216
just snacking on the
pepper this entire time.

00:14:35.216 --> 00:14:37.486
I've eaten handfuls of pepper already

00:14:37.486 --> 00:14:39.433
and my mouth is burning and numb.

00:14:39.433 --> 00:14:42.066
And I love it. It's so good.

00:14:42.066 --> 00:14:43.467
- [Man] How you (mumbles) doing?

00:14:43.467 --> 00:14:44.649
- [Man] We love it.

00:14:44.649 --> 00:14:45.482
- [Man] Alright, I see.

00:14:45.482 --> 00:14:47.004
- [Man] We are durian lovers,

00:14:47.004 --> 00:14:48.718
we have some in the car right now.

00:14:48.718 --> 00:14:49.741
(laughing)

00:14:49.741 --> 00:14:50.915
This is actually a whole eco farm.

00:14:50.915 --> 00:14:52.241
- [Man] Eco friendly, yeah.

00:14:52.241 --> 00:14:54.135
- And it's just blooming with fruit.

00:14:54.135 --> 00:14:57.017
Just mangoes all over, there's jack fruit.

00:14:57.017 --> 00:14:59.432
There's all sorts of edible things

00:14:59.432 --> 00:15:02.363
and then right behind me right here

00:15:02.363 --> 00:15:03.875
is one of the pepper fields

00:15:03.875 --> 00:15:05.320
that we're gonna walk through.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.702
Unfortunately, they have
already done the harvesting

00:15:07.702 --> 00:15:09.647
because it's about to be rainy season.

00:15:09.647 --> 00:15:11.354
So they've done most of the harvesting.

00:15:11.354 --> 00:15:13.019
So there's not a lot of pepper corns

00:15:13.019 --> 00:15:16.797
on the actual vines,
but there's just a few.

00:15:16.797 --> 00:15:18.386
(pop music)

00:15:18.386 --> 00:15:20.697
I just love green pepper, oh it's good.

00:15:20.697 --> 00:15:22.989
And you also just picked,
this will be pepper

00:15:22.989 --> 00:15:24.076
when it grows bigger.

00:15:24.076 --> 00:15:25.158
- That'll be pepper, yes yeah.

00:15:25.158 --> 00:15:29.537
- Ah, that's just a little
tiny baby peppercorn stem.

00:15:29.537 --> 00:15:32.253
- [Man] Yeah, that will
be flower (mumbles) later.

00:15:32.253 --> 00:15:33.503
- Ooh, oh yeah.

00:15:34.898 --> 00:15:36.641
You can definitely taste that it's pepper.

00:15:36.641 --> 00:15:38.049
It kind of goes up your nose a little bit.

00:15:38.049 --> 00:15:39.158
Young pepper leaves.

00:15:39.158 --> 00:15:40.697
- [Man] Yeah, young pepper leaf.

00:15:40.697 --> 00:15:42.447
- Oh cool, thank you.

00:15:47.676 --> 00:15:49.343
Oh, oh it's amazing.

00:15:50.806 --> 00:15:52.893
Has a little bit of a lemon flavor to it.

00:15:52.893 --> 00:15:55.063
The green peppercorns
are the ones that turn

00:15:55.063 --> 00:15:56.131
black when you dry them.

00:15:56.131 --> 00:15:57.134
- [Man] Absolutely yeah.

00:15:57.134 --> 00:15:59.034
- And then the red
peppercorns are more ripe.

00:15:59.034 --> 00:16:00.033
- [Man] Right.

00:16:00.033 --> 00:16:02.021
- The red peppercorns.

00:16:02.021 --> 00:16:04.354
(pop music)

00:16:06.184 --> 00:16:07.715
Oh wow.

00:16:07.715 --> 00:16:12.057
Oh they do have like an almost
fruity pepper taste to them.

00:16:12.057 --> 00:16:14.415
It's a type of spice that does grow on you

00:16:14.415 --> 00:16:15.827
as you keep eating.

00:16:15.827 --> 00:16:18.595
And it just makes your mouth
feel a little bit on fire

00:16:18.595 --> 00:16:21.012
and numbing and it's so good.

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:24.263
(pop music)

00:16:26.309 --> 00:16:31.199
Oh that is a spice overload.
The fruity spice of the vine.

00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:34.292
Check out these durians, oh.

00:16:34.292 --> 00:16:36.352
- They're not ripe yet okay.

00:16:36.352 --> 00:16:39.120
When it's ripe, you smell this one.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.600
- [Man] Oh wow.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.562
- [Man] This is not (mumbles)--

00:16:42.562 --> 00:16:43.538
- Look at this little baby.

00:16:43.538 --> 00:16:44.502
This farm is just gorgeous.

00:16:44.502 --> 00:16:47.972
Full of pepper, there's fruit
trees, durian, rambutan.

00:16:47.972 --> 00:16:50.215
There's herbs all over. Amazing place.

00:16:50.215 --> 00:16:51.048
Ooh.

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:52.823
- Inside.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:58.303
- It's like a pepper walk
in fridge but an oven.

00:16:58.303 --> 00:16:59.255
Okay thank you.

00:16:59.255 --> 00:17:00.523
- [Man] (Mumbles).

00:17:00.523 --> 00:17:01.590
- Okay.

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:03.329
I've already been in a crab steam room

00:17:03.329 --> 00:17:05.555
but now I'm in a pepper steam room.

00:17:05.555 --> 00:17:08.851
This is just a drying room
and it's really hot in here.

00:17:08.851 --> 00:17:11.385
I can feel the humidity and the heat.

00:17:11.385 --> 00:17:13.311
And this is a pepper drying room.

00:17:13.311 --> 00:17:17.051
The pepper aroma is insane
here. It's pepper steam.

00:17:17.051 --> 00:17:19.326
This room is just filled
with pepper steam.

00:17:19.326 --> 00:17:21.939
This is a spice lover's dream come true.

00:17:21.939 --> 00:17:22.930
I could sleep in here.

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:25.779
Look at the size of these
mangoes, just growing.

00:17:25.779 --> 00:17:28.600
Yeah, they're beautiful,
oh this one (laughs).

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.059
- This one (laughs).

00:17:30.059 --> 00:17:33.180
- This one is huge, look
at the size of that mango.

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:35.478
- [Man] Red, black and white.

00:17:35.478 --> 00:17:37.728
(Mumbles), we do quality control.

00:17:37.728 --> 00:17:40.471
- Another reason that
Kampot pepper is so good

00:17:40.471 --> 00:17:42.674
is that it's hand sorted.

00:17:42.674 --> 00:17:44.534
They just sort through the pepper by hand

00:17:44.534 --> 00:17:47.942
picking out all the bad
things and picking out

00:17:47.942 --> 00:17:51.100
all the broken pepper
corns and just choosing

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:52.894
the best quality.

00:17:52.894 --> 00:17:55.318
And that's gonna wrap
up this day trip to Kep

00:17:55.318 --> 00:17:57.394
and to the seafood market.

00:17:57.394 --> 00:18:00.534
That's literally the
definition of a food road trip.

00:18:00.534 --> 00:18:02.650
We just drove straight
to the seafood market.

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:04.557
We bought seafood, we ate seafood.

00:18:04.557 --> 00:18:06.274
Oh and then we had a durian.

00:18:06.274 --> 00:18:08.662
And then we drove to this pepper farm.

00:18:08.662 --> 00:18:12.829
The pepper farm tour was really
really a learning experience

00:18:14.177 --> 00:18:16.049
and the guide is really knowledgeable.

00:18:16.049 --> 00:18:19.371
And the actual tour of
the pepper farm is free

00:18:19.371 --> 00:18:21.538
but then you have an
opportunity to buy pepper.

00:18:21.538 --> 00:18:23.897
This was such a fantastic
day trip from Phnom Penh

00:18:23.897 --> 00:18:26.335
and it was great to get out of the city.

00:18:26.335 --> 00:18:28.502
Uh, all those crabs, okay.

00:18:29.839 --> 00:18:31.661
I'm gonna have to end the video right now

00:18:31.661 --> 00:18:33.563
before I get too excited
again about the crab

00:18:33.563 --> 00:18:35.360
and the durian, and the pepper.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.939
But I want to say a big thank you to you

00:18:36.939 --> 00:18:38.222

00:18:38.222 --> 00:18:40.589

thumbs up if you enjoyed it.

00:18:40.589 --> 00:18:42.085

Goodbye from the pepper
field in Kampot, in Kep.

00:18:53.175 --> 00:18:55.359
