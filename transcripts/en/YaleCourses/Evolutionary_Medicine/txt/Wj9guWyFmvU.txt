Speaker 1:          00:00          Some mental disorders can be viewed as extreme expressions of behaviors that are otherwise normal. The seems to be true for anxiety here. There is an important principle, the smoke detector principal that gives us some insight into our vulnerability seems to be true of depression and obsessive compulsive disorders.

Speaker 2:          00:25          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:25          there are two general kinds of explanation. One is that the disorder is simply the tail of the distribution who said her is normal, selected and adaptive. That generates a population level trade off. I'll remind you of of that image which expresses that idea. The other is that disorder results from the dysregulation of an adjustable system. Anxiety needs to be adjusted to the environment when dysregulated by environmental mismatch in genetic predisposition than a maladaptive behavior can result. So let's have a look at anxiety. Fear and panic are clearly adaptive in appropriate circumstances. Fear of snakes and spiders seems to be innate in some people. Some fear of strangers is probably appropriate. Fear of predators is certainly appropriate. Separation anxiety can help infants to maintain parental support. People who lack the capacity for fear and anxiety would probably not survive very long with exaggerations of fear and anxiety can become pathological.

Speaker 1:          01:39          Hear the smoke detector principle, uh, can give some insight. When a response is cheap and it protects from serious injury, it pays to set the threshold for triggering that response at a very low level. Many false alarms result, but they do not cost very much and virtually all real threats do then trigger helpful responses. The biological systems that react to the threats are built of many components resulting in output distributions that have frequent centers and rare tails. So we can combine that idea with the smoke detector principle. The tails contain the math pathological extreme, such as clinical phobias and anxiety disorders. This insight helps us to understand more than it helps us to treat. I fear, but I think the idea is useful and it's one of Randy nussies real contributions to understanding the evolutionary origins of mental disorders. If the response is cheap, many false alarms may result, but they don't cost much and virtually all real threats do trigger healthful responses when the threshold is set low.

Speaker 2:          02:55          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:55          What about depression? One evolutionary is that depression is a part of normal functional variation in mood. That evolved as a mechanism to allocate effort in proportion to reward. In other words, if you are doing something and you're getting the feedback that it's not working, then depression is one way to mediate withdrawal from that unrewarding situation. This idea fits quite well with the notion of a complex system that produces tales of output, the represent pathological extremes, so the center of the distribution is actually functional and it's a way of keeping people from engaging in activities where they get punished rather than rewarded, but the tails of the distribution are not functional.

Speaker 2:          03:47          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          03:47          both positive manic and negative depressive extremes of mood are then seen as population level tradeoffs with the central region of the distribution of mood variation where variation is normally adaptive and in fact homeostatic, it regulates behavior towards functional ends. We can also take a look at obsessive compulsive disorder from this same general framework. OCD is characterized by ritualistic, repetitive behaviors and fear that a small oversight might lead to disaster. It has substantial heritability and an incidence of about 1% in the population. It may very well represent the tail of a distribution of responses. Who Center is normally adaptive, and that center would be habits. Habits are useful because experience shows they function well and we do not have to think about them. We put ourselves on autopilot and that releases us to think about other things, so we can see. OCD is the exaggeration of a habit that becomes a destructive fixation. To summarize, many mental disorders have easily recognizable counterparts, emotional states and personality features that are part of normal behavior, anxiety, depression, mania, and obsessive compulsive disorder. Or a few of the pathological states that it represent extreme versions of normal behaviors. Milder versions include histrionic, narcissistic, and dependence disorders.
