00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.120
Let's say that Arman
today is 18 years old.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:15.960
And let's say that Diya
today is 2 years old.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.210
And what I am curious
about in this video

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.920
is how many years will it
take-- and let me write this

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:31.390
down-- how many
years will it take

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:43.370
for Arman to be three
times as old as Diya?

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.330
So that's the
question right there,

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.985
and I encourage you to try to
take a shot at this yourself.

00:00:53.985 --> 00:00:55.610
So let's think about
this a little bit.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.840
We're asking how many
years will it take.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.960
That's what we don't know.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.410
That's what we're curious about.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.480
How many years will
it take for Arman

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.900
to be three times
as old as Diya?

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.480
So let's set some variable--
let's say, y for years.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:17.520
Let's say y is equal
to years it will take.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.160
So given that, can we
now set up an equation,

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.350
given this information,
to figure out

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.360
how many years it will take
for Arman to be three times as

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.510
old as Diya?

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.140
Well, let's think about how
old Arman will be in y years.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.290
How old will he be?

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.150
Let me write here.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:48.900
In y years, Arman is
going to be how old?

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.450
Arman is going to be--
well, he's 18 right now--

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.070
and in y years, he's
going to be y years older.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.130
So in y years, Arman is
going to be 18 plus y.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.720
And what about Diya?

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.430
How old will she be in y years?

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.490
Well, she's 2 now,
and in y years,

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.160
she will just be 2 plus y.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.790
So what we're curious about,
now that we know this,

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.960
is how many years will it
take for this quantity,

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.170
for this expression, to be
three times this quantity?

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.990
So we're really curious.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.590
We want to solve for
y such that 18 plus y

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.922
is going to be equal
to 3 times 2 plus y.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.030
Notice, this is
Arman in y years.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.820
This is Diya in y years.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.720
And we're saying that what
Arman's going to be in y years

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.990
is three times what Diya
is going to be in y years.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.780
So we've set up our equation.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.530
Now we can just solve it.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.067
So let's take this step by step.

00:02:56.067 --> 00:02:57.650
So the left hand
side-- and maybe I'll

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.024
do this in a new
color, just so I

00:02:59.024 --> 00:03:01.410
don't have to keep switching--
so on the left hand side,

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.450
I still have 18 plus y.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.830
And on the right hand side,
I can distribute this 3.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.040
So 3 times 2 is 6.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.920
3 times y is 3y.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.820
6 plus 3y.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.660
And then it's always nice
to get all of our constants

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.750
on one side of the equation,
all of our variables

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.460
on the other side
of the equation.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.974
So we have a 3y over here.

00:03:21.974 --> 00:03:24.390
We have more y's on the right
hand side than the left hand

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.720
side.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.360
So let's get rid of the
y's on the left hand side.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.901
You could do it
either way, but you'd

00:03:27.901 --> 00:03:29.420
end up with negative numbers.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.800
So let's subtract
a y from each side.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:39.380
And we are left with, on
the left hand side, 18.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.410
And on the right hand side
you have 6 plus 3 y's.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.700
Take away one of those y's.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.210
You're going to be
left with 2 y's.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.270
Now we can get rid of
the constant term here.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.300
So we will subtract
6 from both sides.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.546
18 minus 6 is 12.

00:03:57.546 --> 00:03:59.670
The whole reason why we
subtracted 6 from the right

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.630
was to get rid of this, 6
minus 6 is 0, so you have 12

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.290
is equal to 2y.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.742
Two times the number of
years it will take is 12,

00:04:06.742 --> 00:04:08.700
and you could probably
solve this in your head.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.750
But if we just want a
one-coefficient year,

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.290
we would divide
by 2 on the right.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.040
Whatever we do to one
side of an equation,

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.590
we have to do it
on the other side.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.450
Otherwise, the equation will
not still be an equation.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:27.800
So we're left with y is equal
to 6, or y is equal to 6.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.880
So going back to the
question, how many years

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.220
will it take for Arman to be
three times as old as Diya?

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.540
Well, it's going
to take six years.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.450
Now, I want you to verify this.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.210
Think about it.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.480
Is this actually true?

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.570
Well, in six years, how
old is Arman going to be?

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.080
He's going to be 18 plus 6.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.040
We now know that
this thing is 6.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.530
So in six years,
Arman is going to be

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.230
18 plus 6, which
is 24 years old.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.300
How old is Diya going to be?

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:07.150
Well, she's going to be 2
plus 6, which is 8 years old.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.160
And lo and behold, 24 is,
indeed, three times as old

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.000
as 8.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.170
In 6 years-- Arman
is 24, Diya is

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:20.329
8-- Arman is three times as
old as Diya, and we are done.
