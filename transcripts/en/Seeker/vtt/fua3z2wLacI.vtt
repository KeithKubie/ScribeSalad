00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.140
There are treaties in place like the Montreal
Protocol and Paris Agreement to help stem

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.870
the rise of global temperatures and greenhouse
gases.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.030
But we might have other tools for managing
climate change at our disposal, one of which,

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.940
oddly, comes from Pluto.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.820
In July of 2015, the New Horizons spacecraft
flew by Pluto.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.120
Among the wealth of data the spacecraft gathered
was the dwarf planet’s global temperature.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.810
And it was a strange result.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.930
From ground-based measurements taking into
account Pluto’s atmosphere and how much

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.050
that atmospheric composition would reflect
and absorb solar radiation, scientists had

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.570
estimated the planet would be on the order
of about 100 degrees Kelvin.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.250
4But the data that came back said otherwise.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.480
Pluto was colder, on average, just 70 K.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.550
A team of researchers suspects that the cause
is not Pluto’s atmosphere but a haze that

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.240
surrounds the planet.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.360
Among the gases that make up Pluto’s thin
-- or rare -- atmosphere are nitrogen and

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.360
methane.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.930
When UV light from the Sun reaches the atmosphere,
both gases become ionized, kicking off electrons

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.930
in the process.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.060
They then react to form complex hydrocarbons
that are heavy enough to fall to the surface.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.259
These are called “tholins” and they give
Pluto it’s reddish hue.

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:07.900
The haze caused by these heavy particles also
cool the planet.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.930
They have higher solar heating and thermal
cooling rates than gas molecules, and because

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.800
they dominate the atmosphere their impact
is significant.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.220
What’s really interesting here is the degree
to which these particles cool Pluto.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.260
The temperature difference is more than a
factor of 10 greater than the impact humans

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.950
have had on Earth’s atmosphere with things
like emissions and greenhouse gases.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.830
So, what if we took this idea and brought
it home?

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.979
What if a similar process on Earth could curb
global temperature rise?

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.280
Scientists have actually seen a similar phenomenon
on our own planet…

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.330
Called Global Dimming, it’s not caused by
complex hydrocarbons but by a combination

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.000
of natural factors like ash from forest fires
and man-made pollutants in the atmosphere.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.890
These particles attract water molecules that
then form clouds that reflect more sunlight

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.240
back into space.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.470
Less sunlight hitting the ground means less
heating.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.820
There is, however, a major downside.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.870
More clouds and atmospheric water could affect
global rainfall patterns leading to drought,

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.860
which would take a toll plant growth.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.840
And that would have a huge impact on the global
ecosystem.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.879
Throwing particles into the atmosphere might
also conceal the full effect of global warming.

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.489
If the dimming happens in conjunction with
the rise in global temperatures, it might

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.090
mask the severity of our planet’s sensitivity
to greenhouse gases.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.310
But information is our greatest ally.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.170
If we can understand and control global dimming,
it could be another defense against climate

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.290
change.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.599

Crazy geoengineering projects like this are
incredible, and this is just one of many.

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.690
Julian has a run-down of some more, here.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.220
And on global dimming, the amount of sunlight
reaching the surface today is, on average,

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.689
less than it was in the 1950s.
