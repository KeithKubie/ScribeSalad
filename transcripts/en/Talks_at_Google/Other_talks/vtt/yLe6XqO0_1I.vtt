MALE SPEAKER 1: Welcome to all
you Googlers out there.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.970
And a very warm welcome to Lenny
Ravich, who came all the

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.600
way from Israel and is the
author of a great book,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.334
actually, which I read a few
years ago, which is called "A

00:00:27.334 --> 00:00:31.040
Funny Thing Happened on the
Way to Enlightenment."

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.850
Obviously, he is, in addition to
being a psychologist and a

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.470
very impactful speaker,
he's also a humorist.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.420
And we were guaranteed by Avi
that we're going to laugh, and

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.410
that we're going to enjoy
ourself, and that we are all

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.900
going to leave smiling.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.530
And hopefully, by leaving this
room smiling, we will then

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.400
have a positive influence on
everyone else in the office.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.270
And we will all go
home and smile.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.870
And then, we will
have a positive

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.530
impact on our families.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.530
LEONARD RAVICH: Play
it forward.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.340
MALE SPEAKER: And, yeah,
we will pay it forward.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.760
So I look forward to laughing
and smiling and feeling a

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.590
little bit better.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:13.920
So Lenny, over to you.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.680
And thank you very much
for coming to Google.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.940
We're very happy to have you.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:18.926
LEONARD RAVICH: My pleasure.

00:01:18.926 --> 00:01:19.912
My pleasure.

00:01:19.912 --> 00:01:21.391
Thank you.

00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:24.225
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:24.225 --> 00:01:28.070
LEONARD RAVICH: Yes, thank
you very much for coming.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.830
Before I begin, I would like
to ask a question.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.550
How many of you would like to
have a more flourishing life,

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:44.730
a more joyful life, open mind,
feeling good, looking good,

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.040
live longer, live stronger?

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.450
If there's anybody here
like that, would

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.270
you raise your hand?

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.830
OK, you almost forgot.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.200
How many people would not like
to have a more flourishing

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.580
life, live longer,
live stronger,

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:59.670
look good, feel good?

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.650
How many people would not?

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.950
OK, I just want to check if
I was in the right place.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.390
Because I'm going to talk to you
about all of those things

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.430
and how to achieve them.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.880
I will be giving you some
things, which we call

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.420
attitudes, that I've discovered
along my journey.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.130
But first, I'd like to tell you
a little story about how

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.800
this all began.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.050
I was working in Tel
Aviv, in Israel, at

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.850
the Ministry of Education.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.110
I was an inspector, a supervisor
of teachers.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.790
If anybody doesn't know what an
inspector is, it's a person

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.120
that used to be a
teacher and then

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.290
decided not to work anymore.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.430
In 1996, I went out
on pension.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.910
And since I've been out on
pension, I've been having

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.270
nightmares.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.830
I keep dreaming I go back to
the Ministry of Education.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.920
And I start out on a journey of
my own to find out what is

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.150
the one thing that all people
in the world want.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.180
What is the most valuable thing
in our lives, which we

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.200
probably don't think
about too much.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.180
So I started sending out
mails, Facebook, I met

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.780
strangers on planes and
asked this question.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.570
What's most important thing
for you in your life?

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.630
What is the most valuable
thing to you?

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.500
And what do you think the most
common answers were?

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.890
Let me hear what you think.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.016
What were the most
common answers?

00:03:19.016 --> 00:03:20.234
AUDIENCE: Being happy.

00:03:20.234 --> 00:03:20.750
LEONARD RAVICH: I'm sorry?

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:21.750
AUDIENCE: Being happy.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:22.700
LEONARD RAVICH: Being happy.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.493
What is your name?

00:03:23.493 --> 00:03:24.300
AUDIENCE: Tulsi.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.900
LEONARD RAVICH: Susie?

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:25.810
AUDIENCE: Tulsi.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.870
LEONARD RAVICH: Sucie.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.370
AUDIENCE: Tulsi.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.870
Tulsi.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.040
Tulsi.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.380
LEONARD RAVICH: Tulsi.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.170
Tulsi.

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.350
Thank you, Tulsi.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.310
OK, anybody else?

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.572
AUDIENCE: Health.

00:03:37.572 --> 00:03:38.300
LEONARD RAVICH: Again?

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.090
AUDIENCE: Health.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.070
AUDIENCE: Health.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.490
LEONARD RAVICH: Health.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:41.110
Who said that?

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.780
What is your name?

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:42.770
AUDIENCE: [? Clea. ?]

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:43.620
LEONARD RAVICH: [? Pia? ?]

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.035
AUDIENCE: [? Clea. ?]

00:03:44.035 --> 00:03:45.145
AUDIENCE: [? Clea. ?]

00:03:45.145 --> 00:03:45.410
LEONARD RAVICH: [? Clea. ?]

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.522
AUDIENCE: [? Clea. ?]

00:03:47.522 --> 00:03:51.180
LEONARD RAVICH: It's very
clear, [? Clea. ?]

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.100
Being healthy.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.355
OK.

00:03:52.355 --> 00:03:52.990
Anybody else?

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:54.700
AUDIENCE: My family.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.260
LEONARD RAVICH: Again?

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.330
AUDIENCE: My family.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.320
LEONARD RAVICH: Family.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.710
Family.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.870
Your name?

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.232
AUDIENCE: No.

00:03:59.232 --> 00:04:00.705
LEONARD RAVICH: OK.

00:04:00.705 --> 00:04:01.196
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:01.196 --> 00:04:03.325
LEONARD RAVICH: I was going
to get you a family.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.130
OK, so we have happy.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.420
We have healthy.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.320
We have family.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.440
Anybody else?

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.990
AUDIENCE: Meaningful
relationships.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.440
LEONARD RAVICH: Meaningful
relationship.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.399
And you are?

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:19.160
AUDIENCE: Loren.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.600
LEONARD RAVICH: Loren.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.100
And that's Alex.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.810
OK, I almost got you confused.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:22.495
OK.

00:04:22.495 --> 00:04:23.816
AUDIENCE: That's all right.

00:04:23.816 --> 00:04:25.500
LEONARD RAVICH: OK, may
I ask you a question?

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.310
Let's say the most important
thing in life to me is family,

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.350
and I get to have a
wonderful, strong,

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.150
functional, healthy family.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.990
I'd like you to fill in this
one word in a sentence.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.880
If I have all of that,
I will be a [MM]

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.560
person?

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.440
Happy.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.130
Somebody said health, yes?

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.440
If I have health, perfect
health, wake up in the morning

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.188
perfect health every day of my
life, I will be a [MM] person.

00:04:59.188 --> 00:05:00.592
AUDIENCE: Happy.

00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:02.550
LEONARD RAVICH: Happy.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.450
OK, who said happy?

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.700
Happy, OK.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.020
What else did we have?

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.340
We had meaningful
relationship.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.580
If I have a real meaningful
relationship, a long lasting,

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.840
meaningful relationship,
I will be a--

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.720
AUDIENCE: It's a
trick question.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.190
LEONARD RAVICH: Trick
question, isn't it?

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.275
AUDIENCE: Fulfilled.

00:05:23.275 --> 00:05:24.085
LEONARD RAVICH: Fulfilled.

00:05:24.085 --> 00:05:25.880
And if I am fulfilled,
I will be--

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:26.250
AUDIENCE: --happy.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.486
LEONARD RAVICH: Happy.

00:05:27.486 --> 00:05:28.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.300
LEONARD RAVICH: OK, so the one
thing we all want is this

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.300
thing called happiness, or joy,
or positive feelings.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.940
Now, of course we want it.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.330
How many people here
are parents?

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.710
OK.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.810
How many people here are
children of parents?

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.710
If I asked you as a parent, or
any parent in the world, what

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.590
do you want most for
your children?

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.060
I want them to be--

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.000
AUDIENCE: --happy.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.820
LEONARD RAVICH: Happy.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.550
OK, we keep going back
to the same subject.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:59.680
We all want that.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.740
And I'll tell you why and how
to achieve it in some ways,

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.030
the awareness at least.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.850
They asked John Lennon--

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.060
anybody remember John Lennon--

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.835
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:06:08.835 --> 00:06:10.985
LEONARD RAVICH: When he was in
grammar school, John what do

00:06:10.985 --> 00:06:12.970
you want to be when
you grow up?

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.380
And his answer was, I
want to be happy.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.520
So the school officials decided
that John Lennon

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.490
didn't understand
the question.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.070
Later on, John Lennon said
that the school officials

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.460
didn't understand life.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.320
So we all want this thing
called happiness.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.650
And what is it?

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.360
It's something we don't
talk about much.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.540
They don't teach you much in
school or at home about what

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.080
the word feeling is.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.470
It's a feeling.

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:39.930
It's a positive feeling.

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.980
And what does this positive
feeling do for us?

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.840
Why do we want it so badly?

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.830
Number one, it not only
feels good, but

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.840
according to research--

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.390
Dr. Bernie Siegel's book "Love,
Medicine and Miracles,"

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:52.880
anybody read it--

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.950
OK, he says that, as a
general rule, happy

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.840
people don't get sick.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.520
You with me on this?

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.560
OK, it protects your health.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.720
Being happy, being in a positive
state of mind, happy

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.610
people don't get sick.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:06.730
That's what he says.

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.320
According to Barbara
Fredrickson--

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.160
and I recommend that you
read her book, called

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.860
"Positivity"--

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.145
says people who have this
positive feeling, people who

00:07:14.145 --> 00:07:17.490
are feeling this happiness or
this optimism of this hope,

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:20.040
live longer, live stronger.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.370
Remember in the beginning I
asked you, who wants to live

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.400
longer and live stronger,
look good.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.970
This is all researched stuff.

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:31.540
This has been done by her and
her researcher in her book.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.830
So we all want this
positive feeling,

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:35.390
because it gives us health.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:36.800
It gives us long life.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.860
It makes us look good.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.010
It makes us feel good.

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:40.540
It helps us in relationships.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:44.450
It helps us in our family and
all kinds of relationships.

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:48.590
I would like to give you five
attitudes, because thinking

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:51.150
positively is not
going to do it.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:54.550
I once saw a movie called
"American Dream" or something

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.930
where this woman is in a car and
she's putting on her tape,

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:02.920
these empowering tapes, I'm
a strong woman type thing.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.250
And she's over and over going,
I'm a strong woman.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:05.030
I'm a strong woman.

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:06.330
I'm a strong woman.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:11.620
So all these positive thinkings
doesn't really help.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.380
What really helps is attitude.

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.510
And what is an attitude?

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.700
It's a way of looking at life.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:21.000
Because everything you think and
everything you feel has an

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.240
effect on the chemistry
in your body, OK?

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.680
If you're feeling stressed out,
if you're feeling fear,

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:32.890
if you're feeling anxiety or
anger, your body is producing

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:35.159
a chemical called cortisol.

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:37.600
And cortisol is a poison.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.159
Enough days of cortisol, and you
could end up with a thing

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:43.630
called stress-related
illnesses.

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:46.970
And I don't care what your diet
is and how much you jog.

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:49.540
This will get you.

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.305
If you're feeling good, if
you're feeling positive, if

00:08:51.305 --> 00:08:55.010
your feeling's this happy
feeling, what happens is your

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:56.285
body produces endorphins.

00:08:56.285 --> 00:08:57.510
May I have a drink?

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:58.380
Is it OK?

00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:59.630
Thank you.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:06.660
Endorphins lower stress, protect
your immune system,

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.900
and even strengthen your immune
system, making you

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:12.640
strong against colds, against
sicknesses or diseases.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:13.500
You look much better.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.140
You feel much better.

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:19.010
So here are the five
attitudes.

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:22.940
I'd like to know if you
are willing to take at

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.150
least one or two.

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.570
Who is willing to commit to
taking one or two of these

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.890
attitudes back with you, out
of this room and into your

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:31.620
life, and maybe playing
forward?

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.164
Raise your hand.

00:09:34.164 --> 00:09:37.366
OK, the rest of you
can get out.

00:09:37.366 --> 00:09:41.710
OK, the first attitude is, let's
talk about the worst

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:43.642
thing you can do.

00:09:43.642 --> 00:09:47.860
The worst thing you can do is
take yourself seriously, OK?

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.480
Seriousness is a disease,
dis ease.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.440
It's not funny.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.810
My father told me when I was a
kid, he said to me, Lenny--

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:03.840
he used to call me Lenny,
because that's my name--

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.310
this side is a lot more
intelligent than this side,

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:10.188
I'll tell you that.

00:10:10.188 --> 00:10:12.378
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:12.378 --> 00:10:13.680
LEONARD RAVICH: He said,
Lenny, don't

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.920
take yourself seriously.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.540
Nobody else does.

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.290
I said, thanks, Dad.

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:21.230
Anyway, one of the things
that you can do--

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:22.140
and keep this in mind.

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.040
This is an awareness session.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.940
Because only in one hour,
I can't go, boom, you're

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.020
changed, but you can
get an awareness--

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:31.960
and that is, at every
opportunity, laugh at yourself

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.880
and breathe.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.110
By laughing at yourself, you're

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:37.180
not belittling yourself.

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:38.630
You're not lowering
your self-esteem.

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:39.900
You're doing the opposite.

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.540
You're saying to the world,
I'm not perfect.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.440
I made bloopers, mistakes,
defects.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.880
And I have addictions.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.160
I laugh at them.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.350
And I accept myself.

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:50.570
And that's the way it is.

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:53.570
It Is the highest form
of humor that you

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:54.820
can possibly do.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:58.090
And try to think about this
every single day of your life.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:00.450
Any time you make a mistake or
you did something wrong,

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:04.650
instead of saying, oh, stupid,
say, hey, this is fun.

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:06.390
Let me give you an example.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:08.450
When I was a young
man growing up--

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:10.540
I grew up in the
United States--

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.380
and I had a dream.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.660
And that dream was I wanted to
be a radio and television

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.610
announcer, you know, the guy
that sits in front of the

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:21.240
camera and delivers the news,
like a news [INAUDIBLE],

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.836
whatever it is.

00:11:22.836 --> 00:11:26.330
And so I went to school in
Boston, to a school called

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.370
Emerson College, where
they taught theater.

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:32.775
And one of the subjects I
learned was broadcasting,

00:11:32.775 --> 00:11:36.540
where they taught you how to
speak like a radio announcer,

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.230
an American radio announcer.

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:40.220
And you had to speak something
like this.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:49.250
And now, back to our show,
"The Flying Chicken." I

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:53.360
practiced this so much, and I
got into this voice so much, I

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.510
couldn't get out.

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:56.220
It was embarrassing.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:57.050
I would go to a party.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:01.440
Hello, John, how are you, go
home, hello, darling, how

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.690
about a hug?

00:12:04.996 --> 00:12:10.350
I finally got a job at
WAPI TV and Radio

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:11.710
in Birmingham, Alabama.

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:13.550
Anybody know where Birmingham,
Alabama is?

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:18.490
It's down south, next to
Georgia, Louisiana, Texas.

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:20.060
And I was very excited.

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:24.470
My first day at work, I sat
in front of the camera.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:27.310
I had to go on the
air at 8 o'clock.

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:30.930
It is now one minute to 8:00.

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:32.430
The lights come down
in the studio.

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:35.330
And a light goes
up on the door.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:36.660
It says, on the air.

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.860
And then, there's a red
light on the camera.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:41.180
And the camera comes
in slowly.

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:44.280
And there's this woman who has
earphones, and she goes like

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.782
this to me, [POINTING].

00:12:46.782 --> 00:12:48.240
And she points to me.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.730
And then the music starts,
you know the music, the

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:54.050
broadcasting music, da, da
da, da, da, da, da, da.

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:55.470
And I looked at the camera.

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:56.770
And I said this.

00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:59.160
I said, good evening--

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.950
you know, that voice--

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:05.930
and here is the news, read
to you by Leonard Ravich.

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:08.900
Oh, I was delighted.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:10.410
I had achieved my dream.

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:13.020
I had a dream job, you know.

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:14.900
The next day I came
to the studio.

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:16.950
And I noticed that people's
reactions to me were a little

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:18.320
different, that people
were going like this,

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.070
[SNICKERING], like that.

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:20.570
I go, what happened?

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:23.820
I was receiving mail and
telephone calls.

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:27.300
People wanted to speak
to Leonard Garbage.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.330
I said Ravich, they
heard garbage.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.880
I was getting telephone calls.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:37.710
And people wanted to speak to
Leonard Rubbish, Rabbit.

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:39.720
Is Mr. Rabbit there, you know?

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:45.100
One person even sent mail to
Leonard Ravage, R-A-V-A-G-E,

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.040
which means to--

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.300
I looked it up-- it means
to rape and pillage.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.750
And I am completely innocent
of all wrongdoing.

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:58.390
So I got an hour
before I go on.

00:13:58.390 --> 00:13:59.440
And I'm nervous.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:05.080
And the cortisol, you know, and
the stress, what do I do?

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.240
So I thought, I'll
change my name.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.130
Leonard part, I'll keep
the Leonard part.

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:10.550
That's OK.

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:13.840
But I got to change
the garbage.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.980
OK, so Leonard Ra-- you know,
something with a R-A--

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:18.390
Reynolds, no.

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:20.310
Leonard Roberts, no.

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:21.590
Leonard--

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:22.890
I got it--

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:23.963
Raymond.

00:14:23.963 --> 00:14:26.330
OK, that's cool, huh?

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.210
Leonard Raymond.

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:29.710
OK, so I went to everybody's
office.

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:31.740
I'm no longer Leonard Ravich.

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.060
I'm Leonard Raymond.

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:37.810
Everybody looked up and
said, thank God.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.050
Got in front of the camera,
one minute to 8:00.

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:41.080
Lights come down.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.820
Light goes up on the door,
says on the air.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:46.480
The television camera
comes in, red light.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.050
And there's this producer who
goes like this to me,

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:51.460
[COUNTING DOWN WITH FINGERS].

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:54.450
And I hear the music,
da,da,da,da,da,da,da,da.

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:56.580
And it happened just
like this.

00:14:56.580 --> 00:15:00.080
I looked at the camera and I
said, in that broadcasting

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:04.280
voice, good evening, and here
is the news, read to you by

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:05.580
Leonard [MUMBLING].

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:14.770
I became the first radio and
television announcer in the

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:20.650
history of the United States who
forgot his name during a

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:22.900
live broadcast.

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.900
But you had to be spontaneous,
because it's air time.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.710
And it costs a lot of money, so
you have to say something

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:29.130
right away.

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:32.372
So I said, I forgot my name,
but here is the news.

00:15:32.372 --> 00:15:33.216
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:33.216 --> 00:15:34.466
LEONARD RAVICH: Washington.

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:43.040
If I'm not mistaken, I can see
you laughing and hear you.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:47.260
The thing is, are you laughing
at me or are you laughing--

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:48.045
AUDIENCE: With.

00:15:48.045 --> 00:15:49.500
LEONARD RAVICH: --with me?

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.200
Because when you laugh at
yourself, when you make fun of

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.970
yourself, you bring people
closer to you.

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:57.170
It's called intimacy.

00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:00.632
My interpretation of intimacy
is in-to-me-see.

00:16:00.632 --> 00:16:03.730
And the more of you I show
of me, and I show you my

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:06.680
mistakes, I bring you
closer to me.

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.840
And this makes for meaningful
relationships.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:14.280
So the first tool is laugh
at yourself and breathe.

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.820
Now, I want you to take
something back.

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.960
I don't want you just to
experience this in your mind.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.670
I want you to experience
it in your body.

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:24.150
So we're going to do something
right now, an experiment.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.360
Now, experiments are scary.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.260
And why are they scary?

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.390
Because you leave your
comfort zone.

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:32.260
Because you're going to do
something that you don't know.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:33.690
So you have two choices.

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:36.980
One is not to take part
in this experiment.

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:40.270
The other is to walk
into the fear.

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:44.940
Because when you are afraid and
do it anyway, you learn

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:47.130
something new about yourself.

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:49.300
So you have a choice.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.900
If you're uncomfortable and
you don't want to do

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:52.550
it, don't do it.

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.760
If you're uncomfortable and
you still want to do it,

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.530
remember that you're going
to learn something.

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:59.500
Those people who are going to
participate with me, do this.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:02.640
Raise your finger in the air.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.750
And then you bring it down over
here in front of you.

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:07.589
And you do this,
[POINTING AT SELF].

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:10.130
Now, in about 30 seconds,
you're going to

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:11.702
be laughing at yourself.

00:17:11.702 --> 00:17:14.720
You see, you're already
doing it.

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.482
OK, so smile.

00:17:16.482 --> 00:17:17.650
And when I count to three--

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:20.599
I'm going to say 1, 2, 3-- you
go, ha, ha ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:22.190
OK, 1, 2, 3, and, ha, ha, ha,
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:29.930
1, 2, 3, and ha,ha, ha,ha, ha,
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:33.740
1, 2, 3, and ha, ha, ha,
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:36.470
OK, make believe you've got
a flower in your fingers.

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:38.280
Take the flower, put
it under your nose.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.740
Breathe in a very deeply,
and say, aah.

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:42.260
AUDIENCE: [IN UNISON]

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:42.740
Aah.

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:45.898
LEONARD RAVICH: Breathe in
deeply and say, aah.

00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:47.570
LEONARD RAVICH WITH
AUDIENCE: Aah.

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:49.640
LEONARD RAVICH: OK, so we're
going to have something now, a

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.620
tool, to use when you're in
a stressful situation.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.010
Or if you see somebody in the
office taking themselves too

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:57.231
seriously, you go like this,
[POINTING AT HIMSELF], he, he,

00:17:57.231 --> 00:17:58.363
he, he, he, he, he, he,
he, he, he, he.

00:17:58.363 --> 00:18:00.678
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:00.678 --> 00:18:04.740
LEONARD RAVICH: OK, how many of
you have driver's license?

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:08.350
OK, how many of you have
been in a traffic jam?

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:09.570
How many people don't
particularly

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:10.530
like the traffic jams?

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:12.192
They can be stressful.

00:18:12.192 --> 00:18:13.940
OK, this is what you do
in a traffic jam.

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:16.890
OK, everybody together, even
if you have a car or not.

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:20.770
Put your hand on the wheel, the
steering wheel, that is.

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:21.560
Not that wheel.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.080
This wheel.

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.920
And not the other hand,
just one hand.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.350
And you're in a traffic
jam right now.

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:29.170
OK.

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:31.810
And you take your finger
and put it here.

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:33.850
And you say, after me,
I'm in a traffic jam,

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:34.860
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:36.370
1, 2, 3, and--

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:38.685
LEONARD RAVICH WITH AUDIENCE:
--I am in a traffic jam, ha,

00:18:38.685 --> 00:18:40.456
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,
ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:18:40.456 --> 00:18:42.296
LEONARD RAVICH: 1, 2, 3, and--

00:18:42.296 --> 00:18:43.997
LEONARD RAVICH WITH AUDIENCE:
--I am in a traffic jam, ha,

00:18:43.997 --> 00:18:47.156
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha ha, ha,
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:18:47.156 --> 00:18:48.140
LEONARD RAVICH: 1, 2, 3--

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:49.320
LEONARD RAVICH WITH AUDIENCE:
--I am in a traffic jam, ha,

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.710
ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:51.990
LEONARD RAVICH: Take
your flower.

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:53.970
Don't take your hand
off the wheel.

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:54.520
Don't look around.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.850
People will be looking at you.

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:59.130
And breathe in very deeply.

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:00.110
Say, aah.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:00.976
LEONARD RAVICH WITH
AUDIENCE: Aah.

00:19:00.976 --> 00:19:02.050
LEONARD RAVICH: One more time.

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:03.760
Take a deep breath.

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:04.764
LEONARD RAVICH WITH
AUDIENCE: Aah.

00:19:04.764 --> 00:19:05.970
LEONARD RAVICH: OK, you
can take your hand

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:07.420
off the wheel now.

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.060
We're back in the room.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:10.680
And you have a tool.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.040
Whenever you get stressed-- or
anybody in your house, your

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.350
child, your wife, your husband,
your friend--

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:17.630
you can always take
out the flower.

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:18.860
You could always point
your finger,

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.260
laugh, and breathe deeply.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.380
Breathing deeply is just as
important as laughing.

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:27.540
Before we go on, I want to ask
you if there's anybody here

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.670
who feels any differently than
you did when you first came

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:32.380
in, if there's any difference
in your feeling.

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:33.520
Just check your feelings.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.500
I'm going to explain to
men what feelings are.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.640
Men don't know what
feelings are.

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:38.950
This is the truth.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:42.820
Men, feelings are things
that go on inside.

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:44.590
OK.

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:46.940
Anybody feeling anything
differently than you did when

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.430
you first came in?

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:50.195
Yes?

00:19:50.195 --> 00:19:51.140
What What are you feeling?

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:52.361
AUDIENCE: A little lighter.

00:19:52.361 --> 00:19:55.750
LEONARD RAVICH: A little
lighter, a little lighter.

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:57.730
And, anybody else?

00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:58.530
Yes?

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:01.782
AUDIENCE: I think I'm more aware
of what I'm feeling.

00:20:01.782 --> 00:20:03.630
I'm more aware of the
way I'm thinking.

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:05.540
LEONARD RAVICH: You're more
aware now of what you're

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:06.760
thinking and feeling.

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.770
Could you tell me, if you
don't mind, what you're

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:09.820
thinking and feeling?

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:16.764
AUDIENCE: On how I can feel
better, on how I can manage

00:20:16.764 --> 00:20:20.430
stress or the goof ups better.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:22.650
LEONARD RAVICH: How you
can feel better?

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:25.257
AUDIENCE: Yeah, or how I can
manage stress, manage goof

00:20:25.257 --> 00:20:28.812
ups, manage mistakes better.

00:20:28.812 --> 00:20:29.790
LEONARD RAVICH: OK.

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:34.500
And all of that happened
within 10, 15 seconds.

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.130
Light feeling?

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:36.780
You get that?

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.590
That's what we're talking about,
that positivity, that

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:41.440
thing that makes you feel good,
that thing that protects

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.360
your health, the things that
makes you look good and that

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.130
makes you stronger, OK?

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:50.330
15 seconds every day, a couple
times a day, and you've got

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:51.050
that light feeling.

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:52.450
You've got that good feeling.

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:55.050
Before I go on, I'd like
a nice feeling, too.

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:56.980
So please give me a
round of applause.

00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:03.064
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:03.064 --> 00:21:07.910
LEONARD RAVICH: How many people
here have heard of a

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:13.140
person by the name
of Steve Jobs?

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:15.580
I guess you have.

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:16.830
Bless you.

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:19.298
I suggest that you
go into Google--

00:21:19.298 --> 00:21:20.548
Google--

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:25.510
search YouTube.

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:26.670
He's got a speech--

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:28.780
2005--

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:33.550
a commencement speech, Steve
Jobs to the graduating class

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:35.480
of Stanford University.

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.960
I want you to listen to that,
because it's very inspiring.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.040
Anybody heard of that
speech before?

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:43.802
Do you remember the last two
sentences of that speech?

00:21:43.802 --> 00:21:45.260
LEONARD RAVICH: Stay hungry--

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:46.440
AUDIENCE: --stay foolish.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.286
LEONARD RAVICH: Stay foolish.

00:21:48.286 --> 00:21:49.790
Stay hungry, stay foolish.

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:53.280
Now, stay hungry, I guess it
means to be never really

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:56.180
satisfied completely until you
get to your destination,

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:59.180
whatever that is, or satisfy
your passion.

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:01.240
But stay foolish really stunned
me-- and I'll tell you

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.760
why-- when I heard it.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.080
Because my parents, my teachers,
all told me,

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.390
Leonard, be serious.

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:08.940
You're not going to get anywhere
in this world if

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:10.230
you're not serious.

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:12.200
You're not going to succeed
being a clown.

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.530
So I want to do something
right now to have you

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:22.250
experience what it feels like
to do something foolish, and

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:24.470
why did Steve Jobs say that,
and what is that

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:25.710
going to give us?

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:28.510
So I have to look out into the
audience and ask you this.

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:31.830
How many people here, in this
audience, speak a language

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:38.680
other than English, Hebrew,
or Mandarin?

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.080
What language do you speak?

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:41.180
What language do you speak?

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:42.110
AUDIENCE: Portuguese
and Japanese.

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:43.540
LEONARD RAVICH: Portuguese
and--

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:44.490
AUDIENCE: --Japanese.

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:45.390
LEONARD RAVICH: What do
you speak better,

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:46.255
Portuguese or Japanese?

00:22:46.255 --> 00:22:47.272
AUDIENCE: Portuguese.

00:22:47.272 --> 00:22:49.710
LEONARD RAVICH: OK, but you
can speak Japanese, OK?

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:50.680
And your name, again, is?

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:51.575
AUDIENCE: Daniel.

00:22:51.575 --> 00:22:52.440
LEONARD RAVICH: Daniel.

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.820
Daniel, would you mind
coming up here?

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:56.721
Have a nice round of applause
for Daniel?

00:22:56.721 --> 00:22:58.194
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:58.194 --> 00:22:58.685
LEONARD RAVICH:

00:22:58.685 --> 00:23:00.862
Daniel, stand over here so
you'll be closer to the

00:23:00.862 --> 00:23:01.345
microphone.

00:23:01.345 --> 00:23:02.925
First of all, thank
you very much.

00:23:02.925 --> 00:23:03.590
AUDIENCE: You're welcome.

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:05.725
LEONARD RAVICH: This is a
surprise for you, isn't it?

00:23:05.725 --> 00:23:08.110
AUDIENCE: It is, yes.

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:09.630
LEONARD RAVICH: Now, we're
talking about feelings.

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:11.430
So what does it feel like to
stand up in front of your

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:11.960
friends here?

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.856
AUDIENCE: I'm used to
it already, yeah.

00:23:13.856 --> 00:23:16.700
LEONARD RAVICH: I'm
used to it.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.290
It really surprises me.

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:22.610
Because there was
a research done.

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:25.005
The question was, what is the
scariest thing in the world?

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:30.060
What do you think it is?

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:31.960
They thought the scariest thing
in the world was the

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.480
fear of death.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.570
The fear of death
is number two.

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:38.155
The number one fear is--

00:23:38.155 --> 00:23:39.780
AUDIENCE: Is that
being on stage?

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:41.400
LEONARD RAVICH: Yes,
speaking in public.

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.200
AUDIENCE: With Lenny
next to you.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.080
AUDIENCE: With Lenny.

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.710
LEONARD RAVICH: Yeah, right.

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:47.730
Speaking in public is a
fear worse than death.

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:49.950
So the next time you go to a
funeral, just remember, the

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:53.360
guy giving the last speech
over the grave

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.170
would rather be--

00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:58.062
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:58.062 --> 00:23:59.550
LEONARD RAVICH: --in
the coffin.

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:02.320
So we're going to give Daniel
a nice round of applause.

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.560
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.210
LEONARD RAVICH: Daniel, I want
you to do something for me.

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:07.976
We're going to play a scene.

00:24:07.976 --> 00:24:08.700
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:10.820
LEONARD RAVICH: Can you give me,
just explain to me, just a

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:13.730
little bit, a stressful moment
at work, just one little

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:14.780
stressful moment?

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:17.618
AUDIENCE: OK, someone didn't
clean the micro kitchen.

00:24:17.618 --> 00:24:19.983
LEONARD RAVICH: Somebody what?

00:24:19.983 --> 00:24:21.880
AUDIENCE: Someone
ate their stuff.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.386
And then, they just left it
in the micro kitchen.

00:24:24.386 --> 00:24:25.840
LEONARD RAVICH: OK, they
left it in there.

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:26.904
AUDIENCE: And I was
upset, so much.

00:24:26.904 --> 00:24:28.860
LEONARD RAVICH: OK,
you're upset.

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:29.790
So I'm the one who did it.

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:30.653
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:24:30.653 --> 00:24:33.370
LEONARD RAVICH: Now you come
to me, and you are upset.

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:34.090
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:36.520
LEONARD RAVICH: And I want to
talk to me and be upset in

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:36.985
Portuguese.

00:24:36.985 --> 00:24:38.370
AUDIENCE: In Portuguese, OK.

00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:39.540
LEONARD RAVICH: Now,
why Portuguese?

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:41.450
Because I don't know
Portuguese.

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:44.450
But I'm going to be foolish,
and I'm going to speak

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:46.010
Portuguese gibberish to you.

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:46.290
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:48.460
LEONARD RAVICH: But please
don't laugh, OK?

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:51.440
But answer me as if you really
understand me, seriously.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:54.110
And then, I'll answer you, as
if I really understand you,

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:55.715
like me and my wife, OK?

00:24:55.715 --> 00:24:57.010
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:24:57.010 --> 00:25:00.140
LEONARD RAVICH: Because what
happens when you get foolish,

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:01.570
you go into the right brain.

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:03.110
And when you go into the
right brain, there is a

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:04.780
thing called empathy.

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:06.870
And you start to understand
each other even without

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:07.480
understanding each other.

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:09.500
Because you go into a place of

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:11.760
understanding that is not logical.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.580
Am I making myself clear?

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:15.610
Well, you'll see in
just a moment, OK?

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:18.280
You come to my office, and
you're really upset.

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:21.630
And this is in Portuguese, OK?

00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:23.450
I'm on my computer right now.

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:27.250
Act one, scene one,
take one, action.

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:28.170

Thank you very much.

00:26:23.405 --> 00:26:25.054
Wait a minute.

00:26:25.054 --> 00:26:26.428
Let's give him a round
of applause.

00:26:26.428 --> 00:26:28.720
It was great.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:29.840
I would like you to have
this copy of my book.

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:34.430
LEONARD RAVICH: --and give
you a signature.

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:35.660
One thing before you go.

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:36.570
I want you to know something.

00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:37.430
How many people here
know Daniel?

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:38.955
Raise your hand.

00:26:38.955 --> 00:26:39.960
You don't know Daniel.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:42.080
There's one thing about
Daniel you don't know.

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:45.450
Daniel was in a great,
cruel race, the

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:47.580
cruelest race in nature.

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:51.500
He was in the great
sperm race.

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:53.730
There were millions of sperm,
all trying to get to that same

00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:57.200
egg, but Daniel wouldn't
give up.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:02.690
Because only the fastest, best
and healthiest and strongest

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:04.050
get to the egg first.

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:06.370
I'm so sorry that so many of
your brothers and sisters died

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:06.960
along the way.

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.400
AUDIENCE: Lord knows.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.380
LEONARD RAVICH: Do
you have a car?

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:10.836
AUDIENCE: I don't.

00:27:10.836 --> 00:27:12.765
LEONARD RAVICH: Do you have
a motorcycle, bicycle?

00:27:12.765 --> 00:27:13.816
AUDIENCE: I have a bicycle.

00:27:13.816 --> 00:27:15.850
LEONARD RAVICH: Put this
on your bicycle.

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:17.940
And you'll be foolish.

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:21.870
It says, I won the sperm race.

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:24.530
If you're foolish enough to
put this on your bicycle,

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:26.910
you'll take Steve Jobs
seriously, OK?

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:27.830
AUDIENCE: Thank you, Lenny.

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:28.800
LEONARD RAVICH: Thank
you very much.

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.255
OK, nice round of applause.

00:27:30.255 --> 00:27:33.650
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:36.760
LEONARD RAVICH: OK, so what do
we get out of being a little

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.410
bit foolish?

00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:41.300
I can't leave and come over and
talk to you in gibberish,

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:42.420
because it won't pick me up.

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:43.530
The mic won't pick me up.

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:45.300
So I'm just going to
have to ask you.

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:46.960
We were foolish for a while.

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:51.135
And Daniel, for one thing,
was very creative.

00:27:51.135 --> 00:27:52.730
This was a very creative
moment.

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:55.530
It was a moment that we really
connected even though we

00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:57.080
didn't understand
the language.

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:58.790
What did you get out
of being foolish?

00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:02.240
Why did you think that Steve
Jobs wants us to be foolish?

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.430
Anybody feel anything or think
anything or that anything

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:07.860
happened to you while
we were doing this?

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:09.110
What did you get out of it?

00:28:12.181 --> 00:28:13.167
AUDIENCE: We laughed.

00:28:13.167 --> 00:28:14.535
LEONARD RAVICH: Sorry?

00:28:14.535 --> 00:28:15.742
AUDIENCE: We laughed.

00:28:15.742 --> 00:28:17.180
LEONARD RAVICH: OK,
a good laugh.

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:18.430
AUDIENCE: And he didn't
get cornered.

00:28:21.356 --> 00:28:27.496
He wanted to be mad at you and
get you in a discussion, but

00:28:27.496 --> 00:28:29.530
you just, by dismissing--

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:30.410
LEONARD RAVICH: Yeah.

00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:32.170
AUDIENCE: --that seriousness,
you lost it.

00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:33.990
LEONARD RAVICH: OK.

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:36.830
OK, so we got a laugh
lot of it.

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:38.360
Can you think of anything
more important than a

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:40.470
laugh in your life?

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.690
It's pretty important.

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:49.600
OK, so now we have
two attitudes.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:53.370
One is to laugh at yourself
and breathe.

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:55.510
And the other one is
stay hungry, stay--

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:56.380
AUDIENCE: --foolish.

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:58.310
LEONARD RAVICH: Stay foolish.

00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:00.450
You do foolish things.

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:03.110
As a matter of fact,
talk gibberish.

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:05.280
Or just do something foolish,
like putting a little sticker

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:08.380
on your car or your bicycle
that says I won the sperm

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:11.220
race, and you've done it.

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:12.120
And you feel better.

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.750
And you have a good laugh.

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:17.330
Before I go on, may I have a
round of applause, please?

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:20.970
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:24.560
LEONARD RAVICH: About 11 years
ago, I was sitting in a

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:28.830
restaurant of a hotel that
I was staying at.

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:31.740
And the waitress was
taking my order.

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:35.020
And at the end, she said,
will that be all, sir?

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:36.640
And I said, yes.

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:39.140
And she said, thank
you, and left.

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:41.980
Now, where I come from, I
never heard a waiter or

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.440
waitress say to me "thank
you" by taking my order.

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:47.480
Never happened.

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:48.360
So I was curious.

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.230
And so when she came
back, I said,

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:51.510
can I ask you a question?

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:55.600
Is it the policy of this hotel
for you to say to a guest

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.120
"thank you" for taking
my order?

00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:01.280
And she said no, that's what
I got from my home.

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:06.140
We were taught that if I have
a chance to serve someone,

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:10.760
it's an opportunity for me
to get closer to God.

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:12.110
I was stunned.

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:13.850
She said, why did I say
thank you to you?

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:16.140
Because you gave me an
opportunity to get closer to

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:18.830
God by asking me to serve you.

00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:22.200
Now, why did this have
me in such a shock?

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.430
Because it's the first time in
my life I had ever met a

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:30.330
person who looks at service as
something godly or holy, that

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:32.440
actually helping another person
or serving another

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:36.120
person is a holy act.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:38.000
But you know what
she did for me--

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.280
I thought about it-- and she
did it for you, too.

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:44.130
She gave us what our purpose
and mission in life is.

00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:46.440
Our purpose and mission
in life is to serve.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:49.430
Think about what you
do every day.

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:52.910
It's service, OK?

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:55.790
Our purpose and mission in
life is to improve other

00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:57.150
people's lives.

00:30:57.150 --> 00:31:00.260
That's the whole reason around
Steve Jobs, Bill Gates.

00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:02.440
It's all about improving
people's lives.

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:05.280
That's all they wanted to do.

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.480
So our mission and purpose
in life is what?

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.980
Its our meaning in life.

00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:10.590
Everybody needs a meaning.

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:11.710
Let me just tell you
how important

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:14.020
meaning is in your life.

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:19.440
If anybody's ever read a book
called "Man's Search for

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:26.920
Meaning" by Dr. Frankel, Victor
Frankel, he says that

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:30.690
in order to have meaning in
our lives, it gives us the

00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:35.890
reason to live, the reason to
live, to have meaning, OK?

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:37.910
And if your meaning is service,
if your meaning is

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:39.880
helping other people, improving
other people's

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:42.500
lives, that gives you
a meaning in life.

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:45.790
And I want to just tell
you one little story

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:46.960
about having meaning.

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:49.960
And all of you, before you leave
today, I want you to

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:50.720
make that decision.

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:55.490
My meaning in life is, and
finish the sentence.

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:57.820
And I'll tell you
how it's done.

00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:59.710
Across the street from my
house, my apartment--

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:01.500
I live in Tel Aviv--

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:05.470
there is a dry cleaning shop.

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:07.300
I bring my clothes there.

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:08.980
And there's an elderly man.

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:12.550
When I say elderly man, I mean
my age, which is like

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:13.800
extremely mature.

00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:20.770
And I have a show that
I do in Tel Aviv.

00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:23.700
I have a show at the theater.

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:24.880
And I gave them two tickets.

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:27.940
And I said, come to my show
and enjoy yourself.

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:29.600
They came to my show.

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.820
And when I brought my clothes in
the next day, they said, we

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:33.190
were at your show.

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:35.620
And the man said to me,
you know, that you are

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:37.810
performing a mitzvah.

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:39.630
If anybody doesn't know what
a mitzvah is, in the Jewish

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:43.510
religion, a mitzvah is
doing God's command.

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:45.760
It's a command from God.

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.690
He said, you're doing a mitzvah,
because you're making

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:50.280
people laugh, and you're
teaching them how to be happy.

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:51.420
This is a mitzvah.

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:53.045
And he said to me,
you know what?

00:32:53.045 --> 00:32:55.700
I am also performing
a mitzvah.

00:32:55.700 --> 00:33:01.420
I clean your clothes so that you
could go on stage and do

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:02.210
your mitzvah.

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:05.710
Did you see that man did,
that I want you to do?

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:08.500
In that one second, split
second, instead of saying,

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:10.770
I've got to clean
these clothes.

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:11.710
I've got to wash these.

00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:12.900
Look at all this laundry here.

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:15.310
My god, what am I going to do?

00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:15.920
That's what I do.

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:17.280
All day long, I do this.

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:19.020
What meaning does
my life have?

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:21.840
He gave himself that meaning,
that moment.

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:24.570
I clean your clothes so that
you can go on stage clean.

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:26.750
And you do your mitzvah,
and I do mine by

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:27.450
cleaning your clothes.

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:29.940
Were both doing God's command.

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:34.180
So please, before you leave here
today, make up your mind

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:36.130
what your meaning in life is.

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:37.640
My mission and purpose,
and I think it's

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:40.110
yours, too, is service.

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:43.240
It's improving other people's
lives any way you can.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.350
That's the way to happiness.

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:47.050
That's the way to feel good.

00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:48.570
That's the way to positivity.

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:51.300
And before I go on, I'd like
a nice round of applause.

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:55.960
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:57.660
LEONARD RAVICH: OK, I think
we're doing OK.

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:10.639
When I was younger, my father
told me, Lenny, live every day

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:14.360
as if it's your last,
because one day

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.610
you're going to be right.

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:23.020
This was the best advice
I ever got.

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:26.210
Live every day as if it's your
last, because one day you're

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:29.000
going to be right.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.340
Because when you live every
day as if it's your last,

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:34.250
you're giving life some
kind of urgency.

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:38.560
You know, we're not all
going to live forever.

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:40.389
We're here temporarily.

00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:42.659
What we have is a
temporary gift.

00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:49.659
This thing we call life, it's
fun, but it's over.

00:34:49.659 --> 00:34:52.310
And it's only temporary.

00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:53.840
So when you look in the mirror,
and you say, today is

00:34:53.840 --> 00:35:00.080
my last day, let me give you
an example how I do it.

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:03.490
I was in Turkey with my wife.

00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:07.960
And we were in a resort
area called Bodrum.

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:09.210
It's not bedroom.

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:15.100
And she's talking about
going to Pamukkale.

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:16.080
Let's go to Pamukkale.

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.860
And I said, what's Pamukkale?

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:18.920
She said, I read all about it.

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:19.700
It's a beautiful place.

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:21.880
You must come.

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:25.870
It's 12 hours by Turkish
bus there and 12 hours

00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:27.790
by Turkish bus back.

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:31.800
I said, sweetheart, you
go, I'm staying here.

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.130
She said, I am going.

00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:35.720
But why aren't you coming?

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:40.350
And I said, because today's my
last day, and I don't feel

00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:41.600
like dying on a bus.

00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:47.480
So she said, where do you
want to die today?

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.110
Great question.

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:52.090
We should all be asking
ourselves that.

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:53.720
So she said, where do you
want to die today?

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:58.855
I said, next to the pool with
a nice cold glass of beer.

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:03.570
And if the angel of death
doesn't come, I'm going to

00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:04.820
order a hamburger.

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.950
And this is a philosophy
I took from my mother.

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:14.500
My mother used to eat garlic,
garlic, every night before she

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:16.260
went to sleep.

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:18.680
One night, she forgot the
garlic, and here I am.

00:36:21.518 --> 00:36:25.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:26.960
Let me explain it
to this side.

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.033
See, she ate--

00:36:28.033 --> 00:36:29.512
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:29.512 --> 00:36:31.510
LEONARD RAVICH: --she
ate the garlic.

00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:34.270
You see, my father came to bed,
and you know, one night

00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:35.350
she forgot.

00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:35.970
Never mind.

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:36.890
OK.

00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:41.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:42.740
LEONARD RAVICH: I said,
Mom, why do you eat

00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:43.670
garlic every night?

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:46.560
You know what she said?

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:50.680
She said, if the angel of death
comes tonight, I'll wake

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:52.380
up and ask, who is it?

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.110
The angel of death will go,
[SPITTING SOUND], I'll come

00:36:57.110 --> 00:36:59.490
back tomorrow.

00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:04.010
So we have now four tools, four
attitudes, I want you to

00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:04.570
take with you.

00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:06.370
Again, this is just awareness.

00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:08.460
Any one you want to take
with you, laugh at

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:09.970
yourself and breathe.

00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:10.750
Number two, stay hungry--

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:11.910
AUDIENCE: --stay foolish.

00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:13.190
LEONARD RAVICH: Stay foolish.

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:19.580
Three, you've heard the
sentence, Mission Impossible?

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:21.680
Number three is mission
possible--

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:22.590
service--

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:24.840
serving happiness.

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:28.990
And number four is live every
day as if it's your last,

00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:32.400
because one day you're
going to be right.

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.440
I think I have enough time.

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:38.210
Yes, number five.

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:40.110
But don't leave, I've
got a bonus for you.

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:44.270
Number five is this.

00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:49.810
Remember, I told you who wants
to live a more flourishing

00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:52.850
life, happier, healthier life?

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:55.470
OK, I want to give you a
sentence to say to everybody

00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:57.920
who asks you this question.

00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:59.315
And there's going to be a lot of
people who are going to ask

00:37:59.315 --> 00:38:00.120
you this question.

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:01.870
And they're going to ask you,
how are you, hey, how you

00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:03.950
doing, what's up, [GERMAN].

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:10.550
If you say this sentence to
everybody who says, how are

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:14.730
you, or asks you how you are,
the cells in your brain will

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:17.270
begin to change slowly
over time.

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:20.330
Trust me, this goes on.

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:23.120
If you say this sentence, the
cells in your body will begin

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:24.910
to change over time.

00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:25.880
You'll start to think

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:29.430
differently and look different.

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:34.720
Your whole system will
reorganize itself to serve

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:39.340
you, to be happier serving
happiness.

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:41.750
Would you like to learn
that sentence or not?

00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:42.490
AUDIENCE: [IN UNISON]

00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:43.370
Yes.

00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:44.520
LEONARD RAVICH: A little
bit more passion, OK.

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:45.330
AUDIENCE: [IN UNISON]

00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:46.150
Yes.

00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:46.850
LEONARD RAVICH: [SHOUTING]

00:38:46.850 --> 00:38:48.280
Would you like to learn
that sentence or not?

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:49.000
AUDIENCE: [IN UNISON]

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:49.665
Yes!

00:38:49.665 --> 00:38:51.802
LEONARD RAVICH: That's
passion.

00:38:51.802 --> 00:38:54.020
If somebody comes over
to you and says, hi,

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:56.360
how are you, Alex?

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:59.370
The answer is this.

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:13.880
Now is my best moment, because
there is no other moment.

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:16.410
And it's gone.

00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:18.920
Another one's gone.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:21.340
Another one's gone.

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:25.230
So when is your best, most
exciting, most significant

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:26.170
moment in your life?

00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:26.523
When?

00:39:26.523 --> 00:39:26.850
AUDIENCE: [IN UNISON]

00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:27.315
Now.

00:39:27.315 --> 00:39:28.440
LEONARD RAVICH: I
can't hear you.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:28.873
When?

00:39:28.873 --> 00:39:29.090
AUDIENCE: [IN UNISON]

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:30.076
Now.

00:39:30.076 --> 00:39:33.190
LEONARD RAVICH: All
you've got is now.

00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:34.400
I say this to my neighbors.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:36.940
I make sure that everybody knows
this when they ask me on

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:38.220
the bus or in the elevator.

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:39.920
They say, Lenny, how are you?

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:47.610
And I say, now is my best
moment, because there is no

00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:49.560
other moment.

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:52.471
And they say to me, that means
something's wrong with you.

00:39:52.471 --> 00:39:54.926
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:54.926 --> 00:39:56.550
LEONARD RAVICH: Don't
you read the news?

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:02.090
My wife does not
watch the news.

00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:04.810
She records the news.

00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:06.970
Then, she watches it much later,
comes to me and says,

00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:08.280
boy, am I glad that's over.

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:15.650
The past is history,
the future--

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:16.075
AUDIENCE: --a mystery.

00:40:16.075 --> 00:40:18.510
LEONARD RAVICH: A mystery.

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:19.410
All we have is the--

00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:20.520
AUDIENCE: --present.

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:21.130
LEONARD RAVICH: Present?

00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:21.800
What is present?

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:22.150
AUDIENCE: Now.

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.630
AUDIENCE: A gift.

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:24.340
LEONARD RAVICH: A gift.

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:26.920
You give someone a present,
you give a gift.

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:28.490
If you're living in the
present, you're

00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:29.740
living in the gift.

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:32.970
How many people--

00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:35.700
if anybody here right
now feels the gift--

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:38.520
if you feel the gift
right now, applaud.

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:43.420
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:44.510
LEONARD RAVICH: A
little louder.

00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:46.345
Who feels the gift now?

00:40:46.345 --> 00:40:51.809
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:51.809 --> 00:40:53.535
LEONARD RAVICH: I got enough
time for a bonus.

00:40:59.370 --> 00:41:01.150
Did I hear somebody
say something?

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:04.880
Are you enjoying yourself
so far?

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:05.570
AUDIENCE: [IN UNISON]

00:41:05.570 --> 00:41:06.240
Yes.

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:08.330
LEONARD RAVICH: Because
we're about to finish.

00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:09.770
And you can't get me
again after this.

00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:11.826
You know, you'll have
to call me.

00:41:11.826 --> 00:41:13.174
Lenny, come back.

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:22.040
I want you to do me a favor
and start to dream.

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:23.970
And don't go around
with an editor in

00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:25.560
your head or critic--

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:27.600
when you say, you know
what I would love?

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:30.000
I would love, nah, you
can't do that.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.020
Or somebody says, you
can't do that--

00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:36.020
OK, I want you to please
dream and make your

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:38.530
dreams become a reality.

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:39.540
And I'm not just saying that.

00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:41.830
I'm going to do it for
you right now.

00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:44.870
There's nothing here today, that
I said to you, that you

00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:47.890
didn't get instruction exactly
from me how to do it.

00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:51.540
Laughing at ourselves,
being foolish, OK?

00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:53.380
I did it all, because
I want you to see it

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:55.480
and think about it.

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:58.190
And I want you to see right now
and witness somebody who

00:41:58.190 --> 00:42:02.470
has a dream and makes that
dream become a reality.

00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:04.710
Are you ready for this?

00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:07.020
I have a dream right now.

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:12.410
And my dream is that I say
to you, how are you?

00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:17.350
I envision, in my mind's eye,
that all of you yell back,

00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:23.930
with great passion, now is my
best moment, because there is

00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:26.680
no other moment.

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:30.960
And then I envision myself
saying to you, thank you,

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:35.890
Google, for inviting
me into your lives.

00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:39.400
And thank you for coming
into mine.

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:41.840
And then, I envision all
of you standing up--

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:44.624
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:44.624 --> 00:42:49.460
LEONARD RAVICH: --and giving
me a standing ovation,

00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:56.520
screaming, bravo, with
whistles and screams.

00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:58.980
And then you sing to
me, that's the

00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:00.530
way, uh, uh, uh, huh--

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:01.435
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:01.435 --> 00:43:04.142
LEONARD RAVICH: --I like
it, uh, huh, uh, huh.

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:10.090
Now, why is this dream important
for me to come true?

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:13.350
Because when I leave here, I'm
going to call my wife.

00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:16.360
And I know exactly what
she's going to ask me.

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:19.460
Hi, how was it at Google?

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:22.730
And I'm going to say these
words to her, exactly,

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:25.070
Darling, you won't
believe this.

00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:28.865
At the end of my talk,
everybody stood up.

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:34.440
They gave me a standing
ovation.

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:35.400
You won't believe this.

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:38.770
They screamed, bravo.

00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:39.400
Yeah.

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:40.010
Yeah.

00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:42.110
And you know what else?

00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:46.573
They sang to me, that's the way,
uh, huh, I like it, uh,

00:43:46.573 --> 00:43:47.738
huh, uh, huh.

00:43:47.738 --> 00:43:49.602
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:49.602 --> 00:43:51.220
LEONARD RAVICH: And I don't
want to lie to her.

00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:58.400
So don't embarrass me.

00:43:58.400 --> 00:43:59.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:01.980
LEONARD RAVICH: OK, let's make
his dream a reality.

00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:03.340
How are you?

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:08.310
LEONARD RAVICH WITH AUDIENCE:
Now is my best moment, because

00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:10.870
there is no other moment.

00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:13.400
LEONARD RAVICH: And thank you,
Google, for inviting

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:14.710
me into your life.

00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:17.390
And thank you for coming
into mine.

00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:18.826
Get up!

00:44:18.826 --> 00:44:23.756
[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]

00:44:23.756 --> 00:44:26.467
LEONARD RAVICH WITH AUDIENCE:
That's the way, uh, huh, uh,

00:44:26.467 --> 00:44:29.179
huh, I like it, uh,
huh, uh, huh.

00:44:29.179 --> 00:44:31.841
That's the way, uh, huh,
uh, huh, I like it--

00:44:31.841 --> 00:44:32.137
AUDIENCE: -uh, huh, uh, huh.

00:44:32.137 --> 00:44:33.340
LEONARD RAVICH: Thank
you so much.

00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:35.305
Thank you, thank
you, thank you.

00:44:35.305 --> 00:44:40.885
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:40.885 --> 00:44:43.140
LEONARD RAVICH: Right
on time, boom.

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:46.120
MALE SPEAKER 1: Questions?

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:48.231
May I have five minutes
for questions?

00:44:48.231 --> 00:44:49.955
MALE SPEAKER 2: Any questions?

00:44:49.955 --> 00:44:52.920
MALE SPEAKER 1: Does anyone have
any questions for Lenny?

00:44:58.130 --> 00:44:59.115
I guess not.

00:44:59.115 --> 00:44:59.970
LEONARD RAVICH: Yes?

00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:00.360
What is your name?

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:01.250
AUDIENCE: Vicki.

00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:01.890
LEONARD RAVICH: Vicki.

00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:02.470
Yes, Vicki.

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:04.380
I have to stand here,
Vicki, because the

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:05.622
microphones is here.

00:45:05.622 --> 00:45:08.270
AUDIENCE: What is the happiest
moment of your life so far?

00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:09.975
LEONARD RAVICH: Right now.

00:45:09.975 --> 00:45:12.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:14.185
LEONARD RAVICH: Ask me again.

00:45:14.185 --> 00:45:16.220
AUDIENCE: What's the happiest
moment of your life so far?

00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:17.472
LEONARD RAVICH: Right now.

00:45:17.472 --> 00:45:18.678
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:18.678 --> 00:45:22.190
LEONARD RAVICH: Let's
keep doing this.

00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:26.500
Really, I can't think of any
other moment but this.

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:30.900
And I can't think of a happier
moment than right now.

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:34.330
Thank you for the question.

00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:34.970
Yes?

00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:35.355
Yes?

00:45:35.355 --> 00:45:38.150
AUDIENCE: How do you keep your
attitude like that every day?

00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:40.090
LEONARD RAVICH: How do I keep
this attitude every day?

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:46.510
In the morning, I won't get
out of bed until I have

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:51.590
thanked God for everything
I have.

00:45:51.590 --> 00:45:56.970
I go through a tremendous list
of perfect health, family,

00:45:56.970 --> 00:46:00.790
friends, children,
grandchildren.

00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:02.860
And I think, if you do that
every day, it's called an

00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:07.120
attitude of gratitude, I just
simply won't get out of bed

00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:12.520
until I thank God for allowing
me to take what she has given

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:24.080
me and has helped me to give to
you, to take my gifts, what

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:27.345
I do best, what God has given
me, so I'm able to relate it

00:46:27.345 --> 00:46:29.780
to you, to bring today.

00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:31.080
So I'm thankful for this.

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:32.490
I'm thankful for
the creativity.

00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:33.895
I'm thankful for my life.

00:46:33.895 --> 00:46:35.050
I'm thankful for everything.

00:46:35.050 --> 00:46:36.470
And I go through a whole list.

00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:38.500
And every night before I go to
sleep, I go through this whole

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:40.260
list again.

00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:44.120
And this keeps my attitude up
and my feelings good, because

00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:45.930
I have a lot to be
grateful for.

00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:47.460
And it's called attitude
of gratitude.

00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:49.990
And I think that you
all could do that.

00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:52.840
It's better than counting sheep
before you go to sleep,

00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:53.770
you know, [SNORE]

00:46:53.770 --> 00:46:55.060
two, three, and so on.

00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:56.010
Here comes a blessing.

00:46:56.010 --> 00:46:56.420
You know, this.

00:46:56.420 --> 00:47:00.320
And think, you'll find so many
wonderful things about your

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:04.980
life that you have that we
take for granted that you

00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:07.890
could just give thanks
for, OK?

00:47:07.890 --> 00:47:09.270
Does that answer
your question?

00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:10.110
OK.

00:47:10.110 --> 00:47:10.610
Yes?

00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:12.875
AUDIENCE: Just as a follow up,
in particularly difficult

00:47:12.875 --> 00:47:18.135
time, if it happened in any
life, difficult times, how do

00:47:18.135 --> 00:47:19.596
you practice this?

00:47:19.596 --> 00:47:21.720
LEONARD RAVICH: How did I
deal in difficult times?

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:22.412
AUDIENCE: Very difficult
times.

00:47:22.412 --> 00:47:23.860
LEONARD RAVICH: Very
difficult times.

00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:29.540
I had a lot of faith.

00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:35.450
I felt that somehow there was
a certain belief that I was

00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:38.550
going to get through this.

00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:44.090
And in many times in my life, I
think 100% of the time, when

00:47:44.090 --> 00:47:45.750
I really look back
at the difficult

00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:48.160
times, I caused them.

00:47:51.050 --> 00:47:53.610
And the reason I caused
them was because I

00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:54.980
had to learn a lesson.

00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:58.460
If I look back on my life, and
I think of all the monsters

00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:01.300
I've met along the way,
those monsters have

00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:02.870
been my best teachers.

00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:05.850
Those difficult moments have
made me into the human being

00:48:05.850 --> 00:48:08.780
that I am today.

00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:13.170
And so without the difficult
times, I wouldn't have been

00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:16.820
able to be on this journey.

00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:19.080
And if I look back on it
all, I created it.

00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:21.640
Every monster I created.

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:29.580
And I learned, through a movie
I once saw called "Shrek,"

00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:30.840
that everybody--

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:31.620
did you see "Shrek"--

00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:32.660
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:36.930
LEONARD RAVICH: --where the
donkey and Shrek come to take

00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:40.800
the princess and there's
a dragon?

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:43.190
And the dragon is scaring
everybody and breathing fire.

00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:48.920
And the only one that faces
the dragon is the donkey.

00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:51.790
And he looks into her eyes.

00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:54.570
He says, oh, you're
a girl dragon.

00:48:54.570 --> 00:48:56.810
And she goes [PREENING GESTURE].

00:48:56.810 --> 00:49:00.135
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:00.135 --> 00:49:03.250
LEONARD RAVICH: That's the way
I look at my dragons today.

00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:06.320
I try to find something
beautiful, something exquisite

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:11.282
about them, and turn those
dragons into something lovely.

00:49:11.282 --> 00:49:13.240
He finally marries her,
and they have

00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:16.620
dragon-donkey children.

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:17.430
Thank you for coming.

00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:19.470
Really enjoyed it, yes.

00:49:19.470 --> 00:49:21.410
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:23.520
MALE SPEAKER 1: Guys,
there's also books.

00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:27.810
If you want to enjoy
Lenny's humor more,

00:49:27.810 --> 00:49:29.080
there's books for sale.

00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:32.330
And otherwise, thanks
for bringing some

00:49:32.330 --> 00:49:34.000
light into our afternoon.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.300
LEONARD RAVICH: OK,
my pleasure.

00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:35.945
MALE SPEAKER 1: It was
very enjoyable.

00:49:35.945 --> 00:49:36.460
LEONARD RAVICH: Thank you.

00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:37.030
MALE SPEAKER 1: Thank
you very much.

00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:38.280
LEONARD RAVICH: Thank you.
