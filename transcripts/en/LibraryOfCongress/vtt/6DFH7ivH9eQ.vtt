00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.210
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.890
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada: It
is my enormous pleasure

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.690
to give you Matthew Desmond.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:17.060
[ Applause ]

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.360
&gt;&gt; Matthew Desmond: All right.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.450
Hey. Hi. How are you?

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.750
Oh my goodness.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.050
It's so good to be here.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.350
Oh, Carlos.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.690
I've never met Carlos
but I feel like I've --

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.470
you know, he's been in
my life for the last year

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.320
and I remember reading your review.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.780
I remember the exact place
I was when I read it.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.080
I read it on my phone.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.550 position:56%
It was at a faculty thing and my
editor was sitting right next to me.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.100
And it came in and we were just
looking at it and we were amazed

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.170
and you know, book critics
have an incredibly hard

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.680
and often thankless job.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.000
But you know, for kind of
authors like me who have like,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.310
written other books but they've
been for an academic audience

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.610
that are trying to
break out somewhere --

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.640
general audience, you
know and you know,

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.760
a critic that really does
her job or his job right

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.520
so thank you so much Carlos.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.500
Not only for pushing this
book but for, you know,

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.800
your amazing work at the post.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.240
And it's just good to be
with all of you today.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.040
I donated, I got the sticker.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.340
If you donate you get a sticker.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.830
You didn't mention that.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.700
You get a sticker so
I got one, do it.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.000
So, we should just get into it.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.100
So, we live in a weird country.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.160
We are the richest democracy
with the worst poverty.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.630
That's who we are.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.720 position:56%
And there's no other advanced
industrial society that has the kind

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.050
of poverty that we do or the
depths of poverty that we have

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.910
and that's always troubled me.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.890
And I know it's troubled
a lot of you and I wanted

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.000
to understand the role that
housing plays in that story.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.590
And so I thought that
looking at eviction,

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.620
looking at families
forcibly, physically removed

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.020
from their homes was a decent
way of going about that.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.200
So, I started this work
the old -fashioned way.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.500
I moved into a trailer park

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.180
on the far south side
of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.270
Milwaukee's a city in America.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.610
It's in the middle of the country.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.850
It's our 30th most popular city.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.150
Anyone from Milwaukee?

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.470
Any Milwaukee in the house?

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.770
Over here?

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.070
Love you guys.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.800
Can't make stuff up now, though.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.620
So I moved into a trailer park
in the south side of the city

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.150
and I lived there for
about five months.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.210
And then I moved into a roomy
house on the north of the city.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.510
That's Milwaukee's inner city.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.390
And I lived there about 10 months

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.750
and form those neighborhoods I
followed families getting evicted.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.460
And I went everywhere
with those families.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.340
I went to eviction court with them,

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.180
followed them into shelters
and abandoned homes.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.760
I watched their kids, I slept on
their floor, I ate off their table,

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.550
I went to work with them,
church, AA meetings with them.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.820
Several funerals, I was
even there for a birth.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.270
Like there for birth.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.950
Carlos, have you been to a birth?

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.820
Yeah. I know right, I know, yeah.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.710
It's intense.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.650
It's intense.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.930
So, I try to get to know these
families as much as I could

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.420 position:56%
but I knew to really understand how
the low-income housing market works,

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.720
I needed to get as just as tight

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.340
with the landlords doing
the evicting as I did

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.590
with the families getting
evicted and so I did.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.360 position:56%
And so I went to eviction court with
landlords too and I helped them pass

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.050
that eviction notices
and collect rents.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.790
I saw them buy and sell properties.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.870
I understand why you would
buy properties in some

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.280
of the poorest neighborhoods
in the city.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.600
I understand a little but
more what makes landlords tick

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.610
and what ticks them off.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.210
And I try to write a book about
this incredibly complicated

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.240
but central relationship when it
comes to understanding inequality

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.150
in America today, that
between landlords and tenants.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.570
So, I was going about this work
and there are these questions

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.640
that kept springing to mind like
"How often does eviction happen?

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.940
Who gets evicted?

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.930
What are the long-term consequences
of getting tossed from your home?"

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.790 position:56%
But I went looking for some study
release and data that would allow me

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.530
to address those questions
but I just came up empty.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.160
And so I said, "Okay, I need a --

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.340
I needed to do some things
to collect today to myself."

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.690
And one thing that we
did was designed a survey

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.270 position:56%
because Milwaukee area renter study.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.700
We talked to about 1,100 people
all over the city of Milwaukee.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.190
And we send interviews into some

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.900
of the most distressed
neighborhoods in the city.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.140
Those red dots and some of the
most affluent neighborhoods

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.850
in the city, those blue dots.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.300
I had an interviewer mugged.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.690
One was bitten by a dog.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.570 position:56%
That's actually the same guy, Steve.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.390
Steve needs to work on
his situational awareness.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.950
But you know, we worked
really hard for this data.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.730
We got an 84 percent response rate

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.640
which in nerd land
is like really good.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.430
And we asked families like
250 questions about their kids

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.040
and their housing and their health
and their experience with eviction.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.460
I didn't stop there.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.560
We analyzed hundreds of
thousands of evictions records

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.400
that went through the civil court.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.030
We talked to 250 people right after
they're evicted because we wanted

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.330
to know "Why do you get evicted

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.180
but you don't even though you
owe your landlord the exact

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.520
same amount?"

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.620
Analyzing millions of 911 calls,
hundreds of nuisance ordinances

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.360
and I try to put that big data into
conversation with the smaller data.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.660
My notebooks.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.520
Like the things that I was
learning on the ground every day.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.040
Just living alongside tenants
and working alongside landlords.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.530 position:56%
And Evicted in that spirit is really
a book that starts on the ground

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:52.830
and it ends on the ground.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.670
It follows eight families
through the process of eviction.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.750
You know, you meet Scott.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.770
Scott's in the book, you know,
Scott was this kind of nurse

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.180
that got hooked on pain killers and
developed an addiction to heroin.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.150 position:56%
And you kind of see him wrestle with
that addiction throughout the book.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.180
Vanetta's in the book.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.280
You know, Vanetta's a single mom
trying to raise three young kids.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.680
She's working an old country buffet
and her hours got cut and she was

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.830
so terrified of losing her
home and maybe her kids

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.940
to child protected services
that she committed armed robbery

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.240
to pay the rent.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.800
This is someone without
any criminal record.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.550
And in that spirit, in the spirit
of letting the folks that are

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.850
on the front edge of this problem
be our biggest teachers, you know,

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.870
I want to share with you
one person's story today

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.010
and that's Arlene's story.

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.470
So Arlene had a 14 year old son,
Jory, and one day he was cutting

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.240
up throwing snowballs at passing
cars and he smacked this car.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.550
And it was like -- and
this man jumped out.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.920
So, Jory and his cousin
like hightailed it inside

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.860 position:56%
and they locked -- and he locked the
door but the man followed them there

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.160
and he kicked the door in.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.460
he kicked the door down.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.190
And thank God he left before
anything else happened

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.910
but when Arlene's landlord
found out about that she decided

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.190
to evict Arlene and her
boy for damaging property.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.720
So Arlene took her two sons,
Story and Jafaris, who was six,

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.890
to the salvation army
homeless shelter.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.910
Which everyone in Milwaukee
just calls the lodge

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.200
so you can tell your kids, "We're
staying at the lodge tonight."

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.590
Like it's a hotel.

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.450
And from there they're on the
hunt for another place to live

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:21.910
and they found one on 19th street
but there was often no water

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.430
and Jory had to bucket out
what was in the toilet.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.280
Arlene told me, "You know,
it was 525 for a whole house

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.740
and it was quiet and it
was my favorite place."

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.560
When we looked in that survey and
we asked what happens to families

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.970
after they're evicted, one big
thing we found is that they move

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.090
into much worse housing
than they lived in before.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.980
So, if he want to know why
some kids live with lead paint,

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.050
and exposed wires,
no heat, no water,

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.610
one reason is their families
are forced to accept those kinds

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.440
of conditions in the harried
aftermath of an eviction.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.620
So, the city eventually found
Arlene's favorite place unfit

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.920
for human habitation.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.230
They boarded up the windows and the
doors and Arlene and her boys were

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:59.620
on the hunt for another
place to live.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.500
And she told Story like, "We
take whatever we can get."

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.500
Which is what moving looks
like at the very bottom.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.120 position:56%
Just like taking what you could get.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.010
And what Arlene could get is
this drab apartment complex

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:12.430
on Atkinson avenue but she
soon feared for her boys

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.600
because she learned it was
like a haven for drug dealers.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.150
In face the whole block
was drug soaked and hot.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.110
And she feared for Story
because he was goofy

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.610
and had this beautiful smile
and would talk to anyone.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:26.770
So, in Arlene's case, why she
moved, the fact that she was forced

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.130
out of this place was really
important for why she ended

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:30.610
up in such a bad neighborhood.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.680
And we thought, "Can we
test that statistically?"

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.620
And we did and we found that
you can control for a lot

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.130
of different things and
you still see the families

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:40.510
who get evicted move from poor
neighborhoods to even poorer ones,

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.500
from dangerous neighborhoods
to blocks

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.800
with even higher level of crime.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:48.130
Eviction pushes families
deeper into disadvantage.

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.500
So Arlene moved out of
Atkinson as fast as she could.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.640
She found this two
bedroom bottom muted duplex

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.730
on 13th street and Keefe.

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.980
There's a big ol' hole in
the living room window.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.660
There wasn't like a lock
so Arlene had to lock it

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:04.250
with like a plank she
slit into brackets.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:08.610 position:56%
The cargo was just filthy and ground
in but she put on a good face.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:11.860
You know, she hung up curtains
and she took a piece of clothing

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.450
and she stuffed it in
that whole in the window.

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:17.740
So, the rent for this kind
of place, which was located

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.010
in a really poor neighborhood
in Milwaukee,

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:24.220
which is our fourth poorest
city, was 550 dollars a month,

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:27.670
utilities not included
which consumed 88 percent

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:30.180
of Arlene's welfare check.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.680
And she knew that some
months she would have

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.400
to sell her food stamps
to make rent.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.650
And her and the boys would try
to get by on oodles and noodles.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:39.260
You know, when you're paying over
80 percent of your income on rent,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:40.890 position:56%
there's no extra money for anything.

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:44.690
Like no money for clothes
for Jory or toys for Jafaris.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:49.300
Jafaris had this like amazing
ability to transform like a bucket

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:53.070
or a bottle or a dog leash
whatever he could get his hands on.

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:56.880
And the soldiers and tanks,
you know, engaged in warfare.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.330
So, here's the situation,
you know, Arlene is not alone

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.330
in spending the vast majority
of her income on housing.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:07.450
For about 100 years there's
been a consensus in America

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:09.150
that we should spend
about 30 percent

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.550
of our income on housing costs.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:15.710
That gives us enough money to save,
afford enough food, transportation

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:18.500
but that is so far
off in the realities

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.170
of most renting families today.

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:23.830
So, clicker, clicker.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.660
I see the light going on.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.340
We have pros on it.

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:44.790
Are we --

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.600
I can go on.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.900
It's okay.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:51.810
I'm not like PowerPoint addicted.

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.510
But kind of.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:58.340
[ Laughter ]

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:02.220
I'm going to on and I'm
going to let the pros handle.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:07.470
So, for the past 20
years the percentage

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:10.410
of poor renting families spending
30 percent of their income or less

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:11.860
on housing, our widespread standard

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.790
of affordability has gone
down and down and down.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:17.050
But the percentage of poor renting
families spending at least half

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:20.110
of their income on housing has
gone up and up and up to the point

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:22.220
that today the majority

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.710
of poor renting families are
spending half their income

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:28.150
on housing costs and about one in
four of those families are spending

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:33.390
over 70 percent of their income
just on rent and utilities.

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:36.210
So, just imagine that, 70 percent
of your income is just like gone

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:37.510
in the beginning of the month.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.990
If you want a roof over
your head or hot water

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:43.430
under those condition you don't
need to make a huge mistake

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:47.540
or have a big emergency wash over
your life to invite to evictions.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.870
Something as innocent
as snowball can do it.

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:53.680
So, for people like Arlene,
eviction is much more the result

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:57.530
of inevitability than
personal irresponsibility.

00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:59.820
So, how do we get to this place?

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.430
So, there's three ingredients
to this recipe.

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:05.540
One is the one we talk about a lot,
which is for the past two decades,

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.430
really the past four,
the incomes of Americans

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:10.130
of modest means have been plat.

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:13.120
In some areas of the country
they've fallen in real terms.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.810
But as families are watching
their housing costs flat line

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:18.180
or their incomes flat line,
their housing costs were soaring.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:21.980
Between 1995 and today the median
rent in this country adjusting

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.170
for inflation has increased
by over 70 percent.

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:30.060
Cost of fuel and utilities have
increased by 52 percent since 2000.

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:32.460
And so, you have this like gap

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.150
between what low income families
are bringing in and what they have

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.560
to pay for basic shelter needs.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.680
So, then we might ask, and
this is the third ingredient,

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.080
well, where's public housing?

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.910
Or housing assistance of any kind?

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:48.360
And the answer is it's there but
it's only for the lucky minority

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.250
of families that receive it today.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:52.430
So, only about six percent
of poor families that live

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:55.880
in public housing today, that's
that little blue part of the pie,

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:59.120
12 percent receive a
rent reducing voucher,

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.360
which used to be called
section eight vouchers.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.770
But the unlucky majority, the
remaining 75 percent receive --

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:07.810
what's the technical term.

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:13.260
Nothing. Nada, Zippo from state,
local or federal governments.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:14.580
You know, I think that's
be a situation

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.960
that would be utterly
unthinkable when it comes

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.570
to meaning other basic needs.

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:20.550
Imagine if we turned away
three and four families

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:21.850
that apply for food stamps.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:23.260
Like, "I'm sorry, we
don't have enough for you.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:24.780
You have to go hungry."

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:27.860
But that's exactly how we treat
low income families searching

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:29.800
for affordable shelter today.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:34.600
So, Arlene looked up looking for
housing assistance a long time ago.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.130
One day on a whim she stopped by
the housing authority and asked

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:39.000
about the list and she was told

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.170
by the person behind the glass
like, "The list is frozen."

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:45.480
Because on it were 3,500
families who had applied

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.280
for rent assistance five years ago.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.580
And that's not bad.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.630
I mean, the waiting for
public housing in some

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:56.380
of our big cities has not counted
in years, it's counted in decades.

00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:00.610
So, I have two young
children now and if I apply

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:01.910
for public housing today

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:05.160
in this city I would
probably be a grandfather

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.040
by the time my application
came up for review.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.980
So, if Arlene wanted public housing
this is what she'd have to do.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.730
She'd have to wait three or four
years before the list unfroze

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:16.210
and then she'd have to wait
another five or six year

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:18.510
until her name made it
to the top of the pile.

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:21.710
And then she'd just have to pray

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:24.820
that the person reviewing her
application would ignore all the

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:26.880 position:56%
evictions she collected while trying

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.690
to make ends meet unassisted
in the private market.

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:32.610
When we think of the typical poor
family today, we shouldn't think

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:35.140
of them living in public
housing or getting any kind

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:36.690
of help from the government.

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:39.920
We should think of Arlene
because she's the average case.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:45.600
So, on 13th street, Arlene found
this bucket of paint and rollers

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.690
and brushes in the basement and
she gave the walls a fresh coat

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:52.630
but not long after moving in
her sister died and she pitched

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:55.000
in some money for the funeral.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.510
She didn't have the money
but no one else did either

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:00.030
and she gave out of love.

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:02.200
The next month she
missed an appointment

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.750
with her welfare case worker

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:06.340
because the letter announcing
the appointment was mailed

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:10.200
to 19th street or maybe
Atkinson Avenue.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.670
And Arlene's case worker
tried sending in the computer

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:17.660
and Arlene's $620 a month check was
cut, we call it getting sanctioned,

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.410
and by that time she fell
two months behind on rent

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:22.340
and she got the pink papers.

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:27.130
So, Milwaukee is a city of
about 105,000 renter homes.

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:30.770
Every year in Milwaukee landlords
evict about 16,000 people.

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:34.740
That's about 40 people a
day evicted in Milwaukee.

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.550
We've know crunched the numbers
in Cleveland, in Kansas City,

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:40.770
in Chicago, we found rates
similar to Milwaukee's.

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:45.170
New York city you see 60 marshal
evictions every single day.

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:46.470
It's estimated that renters

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:49.960
in over 2.8 million homes
think they'll be evicted soon.

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.980 position:56%
Now, the first time I crunched these
numbers I thought they're wrong

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:54.290
because they are so high.

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:58.300
They're wicked scary,
as we say in Boston.

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:02.210
But these numbers only count
formal court ordered evictions

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:04.780
and there are other ways,
cheaper and quicker ways

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.560
for a landlord to get you out.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.310
So, Joe Prozinski, he was a
building manager in the inner city,

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:11.940
and he said, "You know, Matt,
for every eviction I do that goes

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:14.020
to the court, there are
like 10 that don't."

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:18.050
So, what Joe would do is say
like, "Look, Carlos, you know,

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:20.110
you're behind, man, and
I just I need my money.

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:21.910
I'll tell you what.

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:25.740 position:56%
I'll give you $200 and I'll let you
use my van if you're out by Sunday."

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:28.700
So, if you got to get evicted,
that's not a bad eviction.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:30.350
I met another landlord
that if you're behind,

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:31.990
he'll just take your door off.

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:35.100 position:56%
There are a lot of ways to get a
family out and we worked really hard

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.040
in that survey to capture
all those informal eviction

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.340
that never go through the court.

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:42.950 position:56%
And if you had those up with formal
evictions that are legally processed

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:45.080
and if you count things
like building condemnations,

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:48.260
like what happened to
Arlene's place on 19th street

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:53.150 position:56%
and landlord foreclosures, you learn
that every two years in Milwaukee,

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:57.970
one in eight renters is
evicted, which is crazy.

00:15:57.970 --> 00:15:59.270
One in eight.

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:01.200
Not one in eight single moms, not
one in eight folks in deep poverty,

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:05.500
just one in eight renters
every eight -- every two years.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.940
And like poverty researchers
and journalists like me,

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:12.000
like for a long time we've
written sentences like this.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.690
"Low income families exhibit high
rates of residential insecurity."

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:19.930
And we haven't said why and I
think what we're learning is

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:23.230
that poor folks are moving so
much because they're forced to.

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:25.060
And it's not just a
rhetorical point, you know,

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.490
we have a statistical model
that shows that if you control

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:31.260
for evictions, low income families
don't move more than anyone else,

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.820
which means if we want
more family stability

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:37.580
and we want more community
stability we need fewer evictions.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:41.000
This is a problem that affects
the young and the old, the sick

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.350
and the able bodied, but the face

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:45.580
of our eviction epidemic
is just moms with kids.

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:47.960
Moms with kids, if you go
into any urban housing court

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.610
around the country you just see
like a ton of kids sitting there.

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:55.180 position:56%
Until recently the south Bronx, it's
housing court had a daycare inside

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:58.460
of it because there were so many
kids coming through its stores.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:01.550
And low income African American
women like Arlene and moms

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:05.550
in particular are evicted
at startlingly high rates.

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:07.220
Among Milwaukee renters, one

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.500
in five black women report
being evicted sometime

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:14.010
in their life compared
to one in 15 white women.

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:16.710
And I think that should trouble us.

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:18.950
I think that should
disturb us because it means

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:21.490
that eviction is something
like the feminine equivalent

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:23.210
to incarceration.

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:24.540
Now, we know that many of our poor,

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:27.690
young African American men are
being swept out by the long arm

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:29.170
of the criminal justice system.

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:30.990
They're being locked up.

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:33.330
Many of our poor African-American
women are being locked out

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:35.150
and they're disproportionately
bearing the brunt

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:37.730
of the eviction crisis.

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:41.310 position:56%
This also isn't just a crisis that's
on the north side of Milwaukee

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:42.610
or the south side of Chicago.

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:44.550
This is in poor white communities
which I write about a lot

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:47.060
in my books and Latino
and immigrant communities.

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:50.090
It's in expensive cities like this
one and it's in inexpensive cities

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:51.790
like Milwaukee and
Baltimore and Huston.

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:55.370
One in five of all renters in
America now spends over 50 percent

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:57.200
of their income on housing.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:03.570 position:56%
So, Arlene went to eviction court
and as is court custom in Milwaukee,

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:07.040
she got to stay two extra
days in her apartment for each

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.170 position:56%
of her two days, and those days came
and went and she was ordered to be

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:12.820
out on a day in early January.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:16.960
My Milwaukee friends here will tell
you January is cold in Milwaukee

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.350
and this January was
especially cold.

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:23.820
The weather men had said it would
drop below 40 with the wind chill.

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.790
But if Arlene waited
any longer, you know,

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:30.300
the landlord would call the sheriff
and he would arrive within 10 days

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:34.390
with a judge's order and a
side arm and a team of movers

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:36.370
and they would have piled
everything on the side walk.

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:39.180
And they take everything, like
the meat cuts in the freezer,

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:40.870
the shower curtains, the bible,

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:43.450
the silk plants, Jarafis'
asthma machine.

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:48.800
And so, Arlene just struck out into
the cold and after a lot of calls,

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:53.700 position:56%
you know, she finally found domestic
violence shelter room 30 minutes

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.000
away from Milwaukee.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.400
She just lied about being abused
so she could get her boys a roof

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:02.180
and she was once again on the
hunt for another place to live.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:09.220
So, she called on or applied
to 20 apartments, and then 40,

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:13.700
and then 60, and then 80.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:15.000
I counted.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.890
She was accepted to none of them.

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:20.670
Even in the inner city
many were out of reach.

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:21.970
And the place she could afford,

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:24.740
if she basically tossed
everything she had at the rent,

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:26.040
weren't calling back either.

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:29.870
And part of the reason, besides her
poverty, was her eviction record.

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:33.290 position:56%
So, in Milwaukee your eviction is
published publicly online for anyone

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:38.820
to see and if it's not in your
city there are literally hundreds

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:40.210
of tenant screening
companies waiting

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:41.900
to sell landlords this information.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.090 position:56%
And this is a big deal to landlords.

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:46.040
You know, most land lords
that I spent time with said,

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:48.080
"We're not going to take
anyone with an eviction

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.040 position:56%
within the last two or three years."

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.870
So, this mark, this
blemish of eviction

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:55.740
that follows families is the reason
they are forced into worse housing

00:19:55.740 --> 00:20:00.590
and into worse neighborhoods
after they're evicted.

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:05.250
So finally at the 90th
landlord, Mr. 90 said yes.

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:09.360
He had a one-bedroom
apartment, it was $525.

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.580
Arlene didn't much consider,
like, the conditions of the place,

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:13.880
what the neighborhood was like.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.430
"A house is a house,"
she told Story.

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:21.420
So two months after their eviction
court hearing, they moved in.

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:22.720
And Arlene liked it.

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.980
You know, all the lights worked,
all the cabinets had fixtures.

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:30.290
And when she and the boys had
unloaded a bunch of the stuff,

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:33.300
Arlene just like sat down
on the floor and she found

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:38.020
like a trash bag full of
towels and leaned against it.

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:42.010
And Story came over and, like,
pitched his 14-year-old head

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:47.220
into her shoulder, and Jafaris came
and like snuggled into her lap,

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:52.670
and they just stayed like
that for a long time.

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:54.760
So Arlene got her stuff
out of storage.

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.730
She hung pictures on the wall.

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:58.670
She hung a sign over the
sink to Story that said,

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:01.240
"If you do not clean
up after yourself,

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.010
we are going to have problems."

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:09.150
Do you guys remember
what it's like to 14?

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:10.540
Sucky and brutal.

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:13.480
And it's especially hard to be 14

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.220
and experience long
stretches of homelessness.

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:20.010
Between 7th and 8th grade, Story
went to five different schools.

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:24.020
And at his new school, he
started acting out a little bit,

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:25.900 position:56%
and one day a teacher yelled at him.

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:30.120
And he got mad and he kicked
her in the shin and he ran home.

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.480 position:56%
And the teacher called the principal

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.780
but then she thought it would be
appropriate to call the police,

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:38.050
and when officers visited Arlene
and her boys at the new apartment,

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:44.250
and the landlord found out about
that, he told her she had to go.

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:45.550
It's kids.

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:48.610
You know, kids are a
big part of this story.

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:51.190
They can prolong the time you're
homeless after your eviction,

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:54.330
and they sometimes are the
reason for your eviction.

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:57.310 position:56%
In fact, when we look at that
survey that we did in housing court,

00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:58.820
that survey where we
were trying understand,

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.150
"Why is it that you get
evicted but you don't,

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:03.040
even though you owe your
landlord the same thing?"

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:06.520
What we found was it wasn't
race, it wasn't gender,

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:07.950
it wasn't even how much you owed.

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:09.500
It was kids.

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:11.300
If you lived with children,

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.260
the chance of you getting
evicted tripled [inaudible].

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:16.780
What you're seeing in that
finding is landlord discretion.

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.080
You're seeing the landlord say,

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:21.180
"I'll work with you
but not with you."

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:27.400 position:56%
Because, you know, like, kids, like,
use the curtains for superhero capes

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.570 position:56%
and they flush toys down the toilet.

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:31.440
They cause some guy whose
car's just been smacked

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:34.000
with a snowball to
kick your door in.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.450
They can test positive for lead
poisoning, draw the attention

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:39.110
of child protective
services, the police.

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:42.320
"Kids cause us headache," is
what one landlord told me.

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:46.810
Family discrimination is illegal,
but we know from studies that many

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:50.610
of us don't even recognize that
as a kind of discrimination.

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:57.480
So after that eviction, Arlene
started to unravel a little bit.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:01.690
She told me, "It's like
I got a curse on me.

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:04.190
It won't stop for nothing.

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:08.230
Sometimes I feel my body
trembling or shaking.

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:10.830
I'm tired but I can't sleep.

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:12.410
I'm fixing to have
a nervous breakdown.

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:14.680
My body's trying to shut down."

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:19.940
I recently published a
study that show that moms

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:25.740 position:56%
who get evicted experience higher
rates of depression two years later.

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:27.950
It sticks with you.

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:31.690
And we know that between
2005 and 2010,

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:34.910
years where housing costs were
soaring around our country,

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:36.500
something else was going up to

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:39.280
and those were suicides
attributed to eviction.

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:42.610
They doubled during
that five-year timespan.

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:51.720
Arlene told me, "Just
my soul is messed up.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.460
I wish my life were different.

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:59.410
I wish that when I be an old lady,
I can sit back and look at my kids

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:03.490
and they be grown and
they, you know,

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:06.980
become something, something
more than me.

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:10.760
And we'll all be together
and be laughing.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:14.970
We'll be remembering stuff like
this and be laughing at it."

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:30.090
The home is the center of life.

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:34.400
It's our refuge from work,

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.930
the pressures of school,
Minnesota streets.

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:42.300
We say at home, we're ourselves.

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.390 position:56%
Everywhere else, we're someone else.

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:50.120
At home, we remove our masks.

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.870
In languages spoken
all over the world,

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:55.290
the word for home encompasses
not just shelter but warmth

00:24:55.290 --> 00:25:00.350
and family, community, the womb.

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:03.630
The ancient Egyptian
hieroglyph for home,

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:06.070
it was the same one for mother.

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:10.210
So eviction causes loss.

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:13.900
Families lose not only their
homes, but often their schools,

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:16.240
their community, your stuff.

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.730
It takes a good amount of time
and money to establish a home.

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:21.830
An eviction can delete all that.

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:26.520 position:56%
An eviction comes with this blemish,
which can cause you not to move

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.720
into a safe neighborhood
and to decent housing,

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.210
it can also prevent you from
moving into public housing,

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:32.890
because many of our
public housing authorities,

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:35.830
even though they don't have
to, count eviction as a blemish

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:37.920
or a strike against an application,

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.330
which means we're systematically
denying housing help

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:42.220
to families that need it most.

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:45.850
So we push those families into slum
housing and into bad neighborhoods.

00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:48.560
We have a study that shows
that eviction causes job loss.

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:51.110
I don't know if any of y'all
in this room have been evicted,

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:53.050
but if you have, you know why.

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:55.820
It's such a consuming,
stressful, drawn-out event.

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:58.390
It can cause you to make mistakes
at work, lose your footing

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:01.080 position:56%
in the labor market, and then
there's the effect that eviction has

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.000
on your soul, like
Arlene would put it.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.830
Your mental health.

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:07.100
Now, I think when we add all
that up, we have to conclude

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:10.960
that evictions, which used
to be rare in this country,

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:15.210
which used to draw crowds, they're
not just a condition of poverty.

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:16.510
They're a cause of it too.

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:18.090
They're making things worse
and they're leaving a deep

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:20.050
and jagged scar on
the next generation,

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:24.020
which means we can't fix poverty
in America without fixing housing.

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:27.450
So how do we fix it?

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:30.960
So imagine if every family
in this country had a decent,

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.450
affordable place to leave.

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:35.300
If Arlene didn't have to give 80
percent of her income to rent,

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.910
she could keep her kids fed and
clothed and off the streets.

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:40.460
We know from previous research

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:43.330
that when families finally receive
a housing voucher after years

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:46.660
and years on the waiting list, when
they finally receive this ticket

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:49.160
that allows them to pay only 30
percent of their income on rent,

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.380
instead of 60 or 70, they
do one consistent thing

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:54.270
with their freed-up income.

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:57.640
They take it to the grocery store.

00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:02.870
They buy more food and their kids
become stronger and less anemic.

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:05.050
And they work.

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:07.530
For the lucky minority
of poor families

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:09.220
that benefit from them today.

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:12.170
But the vast majority of our
pour families aren't so lucky,

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:15.960 position:56%
and their kids, with names like Jori
and Jafar, aren't getting enough

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:19.300
to eat because the rent eats first.

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:22.490
And, like, if we can't afford the
freedoms our country offers us

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:25.740
without a roof over our
head, like basic stuff,

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:28.300
the freedom to better ourselves,
to protect our children,

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:32.340
to be part of a community, then
shouldn't access to a decent,

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:35.980
affordable home be part of what
it means to be an American?

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:37.280
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.080
&gt;&gt; We've affirmed --

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:46.080
[ Applause ]

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:50.260 position:56%
We've affirmed provision and old age
and access to 12 years of education

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:54.400
and basic nutrition to be rights
in this country because we believe

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:58.070 position:56%
that human flourishing and vitality
are impossible without those things.

00:27:58.070 --> 00:28:02.100
There is not an argument that says
that you can go without housing

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.490
and still flourish and
be economically mobile.

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:08.390
Housing should be a right in this
country and the reason is simple.

00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:12.030
Without stable shelter,
everything else falls apart.

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:13.330
So then the question becomes, well,

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:15.090
how do we deliver on
that obligation?

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:18.670
And there's a lot of
good news here actually.

00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:20.060
There's a lot of good news.

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:23.030
I mean, just a few generations
ago, there were slums in our cities

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:25.600
and babies were dying
of tuberculosis

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:28.740
and there were outhouses in the
middle of Philadelphia when some

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.200
of y'all were still alive.

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:33.150
We took on a battle with
the slum and we won.

00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:36.050
We won. And I'll be
the first to admit,

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:38.020
and I think the book is pretty
clear out about this fact,

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:40.180 position:56%
that we still have a long way to go.

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:42.710
When I lived in the trailer park,
I didn't have hot water for most

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:45.090
of the time, and I told the
landlord, like, "I am a writer.

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:47.250
I'm going to write about
you and your trailer park."

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:49.490
[ Laughter ]

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:53.180
So imagine what my
neighbors had to endure.

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:56.120
But there's no arguing that
we haven't made huge steps

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.130
in the right direction when
it comes to the quality

00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:00.110
of housing folks are
living in today.

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:01.990
It's just an important
thing to recognize.

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:04.360 position:56%
Because sometimes when you talk
about poverty, the problem can be --

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:06.030
fell so depressing and
feel so entrenched.

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:10.300
It can feel like, "We fought the
war on poverty and nothing works."

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:11.670
And that's just empirically false.

00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:14.310
When we want to take on
big problems as a country,

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:16.420
we have come up with big solutions.

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:19.690
I also just take a lot of heart
that there's organizations all

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:22.990
around this country just putting in
work, driving down eviction rates,

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:26.000
preserving affordable housing,
fighting family homelessness.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.730
So you can go to this website that
we've started called just shelter,

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:32.290
which amplifies that work, and
you can click on DC or Baltimore,

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:35.520
Virginia, wherever you call
home, and you can figure out,

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.440
"Who's working on this
problem in my own backyard?"

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:40.290
You can learn more about what it
looks like in your own community.

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:43.960
Maybe you can get plugged in
with your time or your money.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.440
So what's the bigger picture?

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:48.240
A problem as big as the
affordable housing crisis calls

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.540
for a big solution.

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:52.710
We are bleeding out and it
would be disingenuous of me

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:56.260
to stand here before you and
say a band-aid fix will do it.

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:57.560
Because it won't.

00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:59.220
We need real bold political
leadership here.

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:04.330
We need real moral vision here, so
one idea that would make a dream

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:08.110
of affordable housing, a dream of a
house for every American a reality,

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:09.980
would be to take a program
that we already have

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:13.010
that works pretty darn well, the
Affordable Housing Voucher Program,

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:16.980
and expand it to everyone
below the poverty line.

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:18.650
So the idea is super simple.

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:20.110
It's not even my idea.

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:23.880
You take this program, and if
you fall below the poverty line,

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:25.180
you qualify for it.

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:27.600
And you get a voucher and you
can live anywhere you want,

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:30.600
as long as your housing isn't
too expensive or too shoddy,

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.460
and instead of paying
60 or 70 percent

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:34.570
of your income on housing,
you pay 30.

00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:36.340
The voucher covers the rest.

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:39.550
That would fundamentally change
the face of poverty in America.

00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:41.480
That would make evictions
rare again.

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:43.630
That would drive down
family homelessness.

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:46.280 position:56%
Families finally would receive that,

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:48.920
that you feel when you're only
paying 30 percent of your income

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:52.780
on housing, and be able to
buy enough food and save.

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:56.160
So there's two questions
here that we might ask.

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:59.950
One, would that be a
disincentive to work?

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:02.020
It's a fair question.

00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:03.960
We in the research community
have spent a lot of time

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:06.470
on that question, and there
are some studies that show

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:08.570
that when families
receive housing assistance,

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:12.070
they also experience a slight
reduction in work hours.

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:13.720
I think they want to just
spend a little bit more time

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:15.330
with their kids.

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:17.770
There are way more studies that
don't find any relationship

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:19.070
between those two things.

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:21.340
Nerds like me call it
a null relationship.

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:26.610 position:56%
And I think the status quo is a much
bigger threat to self-sufficiency

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:29.400
and work than any affordable
housing program could be.

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:32.480
I mean, families are crushed
by the high cost of housing.

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.620
They can't afford community
college classes or job training,

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:38.070
so they can get plugged in in
a better place in the economy.

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:40.540
A lot of them can't afford to stay

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:42.640
in one place long enough
to just hold down a job.

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:46.540 position:56%
And just think of all, like, the
brainpower and talent and creativity

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:50.890 position:56%
that we just squander because we ask
someone like Arlene to spend so much

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:53.590
of hers trying to figure out
how she's going to make rent

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:56.650 position:56%
from one month to the next, or where
she's going to live after her kids

00:31:56.650 --> 00:32:00.560
and her are inevitably,
predictably, evicted.

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:04.480
Poverty reduces people
born for better things.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:07.140
Arlene didn't want some small life.

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:10.430
She didn't want to gain the
system and eek out an existence.

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:12.970
In fact, when she finally
found stable housing,

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:16.190
the first thing she did was
start applying for jobs.

00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:18.670
She wanted to work and thrive
and contribute, and a stable,

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:21.400
affordable home would give
folks like Arlene a shot

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:23.670
at realizing their full potential.

00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:29.180
So the second question
is, can we afford it?

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:33.940
It sounds kind of expensive, a
universal housing voucher program.

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:37.250
It's totally expensive.

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:40.410
We can totally afford it.

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:43.810 position:56%
So Bipartisan Policy Center
crunched the numbers a few years ago

00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:46.630
and they found that the kind
of program that I'm advocating

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:50.380
for today would cost us an
additional 22 billion dollars

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:51.680
a year.

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:52.980
22 billion dollars.

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:54.280
Raw number.

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:56.400 position:56%
Doesn't account for the savings we'd
recoup by driving down homelessness,

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.910
rates of depression, rates of
asthma, things we already pay for,

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:00.210
because there's two ways to spend.

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:02.280
We can spend smart
or we spend stupid.

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.860
That's just the raw number.

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:08.380
Now, 22 billion dollars
is not a small figure,

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:10.340
but it's well within our capacity.

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:12.410
We have the money.

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:15.370
We just made decisions
about how to spend it.

00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:19.220
So, every year in this country,
homeowner tax subsidies,

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:23.020
especially the mortgage
interest deduction, they far,

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:26.890
far outpace direct housing
assistance to the needy.

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:30.100
We already have a universal
housing program.

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:32.560
It's an entitlement.

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.440
It's just not for poor people.

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:40.170
So the year that Arlene was evicted
from 13th Street, we, as a nation,

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:43.340
spent about 41 billion dollars
on direct housing assistance

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:46.590
to the needy, things like
public housing in Section 8.

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:49.720
That same year, we spent
about 171 billion dollars

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.440
on homeowner tax subsidies.

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:55.980
That number, 171 billion
dollars, that was equivalent

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:59.270
to the entire budgets of the
Departments of Education,

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:06.480
Veteran Affairs, Homeland Security,
Justice and Agriculture, combined.

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:09.070
It's a rather large number.

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:12.660
Most of that benefit goes to
families with six-figure incomes,

00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:14.980
because if your income is
bigger, your mortgage is bigger

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:17.200
so your deduction is too.

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:20.300
Most white families in America
own a home with a mortgage.

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:23.130
Most Latino and African-American
families do not.

00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:26.780
It is hard to think
of a social policy

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:31.200
that more unblushingly amplifies
our racial and economic inequality

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:33.180
than our current housing
policy does.

00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:36.460
So if we want to spend the bulk of
our public dollars on the affluent,

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:39.910
at least when it comes to housing,
let's just be honest about that.

00:34:39.910 --> 00:34:41.210
Let's just own up to that.

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:43.030
Let's just be like, "Yes, this
is the kind of country you want.

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:44.680
This is our social contract."

00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:47.040
Instead of repeating this
lie that the richest country

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:49.610
on the planet can't
afford to do more.

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:51.510
If poverty persists --

00:34:51.510 --> 00:35:00.280
[ Applause ]

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:02.110
You know, if poverty
persists in America,

00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:04.460
it's not because we lack resources.

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:10.910
We lack something else.

00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:12.570
Okay. So it's one idea.

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:13.880
Like, let others come.

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:17.190
You know, one city has to
build, another has to destroy.

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:18.710
Our cities are different.

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:21.810
You know, what works in DC is
going to fail in Milwaukee.

00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:25.890
LA needs a completely different
thing than Birmingham does.

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:28.460
But I think whatever our
way out of this mess,

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:30.160
one thing for me is certain.

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:36.700
Like, this degree of inequality
and this level of social suffering

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:40.910
and this just, like,
blunting of human potential,

00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:44.230
this cold denial of,
like, a basic human need,

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:49.060
I don't -- like, this isn't us.

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:52.450
Like, this doesn't have to be us.

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:55.500
By no American value is
this situation justified.

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:58.720
There's no ethical code, there's
no holy teaching, there's no piece

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:00.560
of scripture that could be summoned

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:02.780
to defend what we've allowed
our country to become.

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:04.580
Thank you.

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:31.660
[ Applause ]

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:33.320
We have time for questions.

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:37.450
Thanks, sound guys, for getting
through that technical difficulty.

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:39.120
It's really great to
see you guys up here.

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:41.760
Thank you so much.

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:45.230
&gt;&gt; Could you talk about how
you established relationships

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:49.860
that enabled you to be with the
renters and with the landlords?

00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:51.160
&gt;&gt; Matthew Desmond: Yeah.

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.140
So I think living in the
community helped a lot.

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:55.450
I think, you know, Scott
and Lorraine and other folks

00:36:55.450 --> 00:36:58.620
that I wrote about in the book were
my neighbors in the trailer park.

00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:01.760
And the landlords were really keen

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.920
on just people understanding
their work.

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.740
You know, they were
proud of their work.

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:07.680
They often were, like,
self-starters, you know,

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:10.770
and built a kind of
business up from nothing

00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:13.110
and they were interested in that.

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:16.440
That doesn't mean it was easy all
the time, and often, you know,

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:17.900
tenants would not tell me things.

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:19.340
They were afraid I'd
tell the landlord.

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:21.200
Sometimes the landlord
would do the same.

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.630
But I think just spending
enough time with folks

00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:29.350
and really living there
helped do it, yeah.

00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:34.060
&gt;&gt; This is a great book and I love
the combination of quantitative

00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:37.350
and qualitative materials
that you brought together.

00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:40.080
But I'd like to go back to
your last comments here.

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.840
Could you kind of recreate
the historical context

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:46.770
in which the original housing
voucher program came about?

00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:50.760
And are those replicable
in the near future?

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.740
And it's not a negative question,

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:55.100
but just how did it come
about, first of all?

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:56.880
&gt;&gt; Matthew Desmond: Negative
questions are good too, you know?

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.910
Negative questions are good.

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:01.220
And so, but I don't see
it as a negative question.

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:02.950
That's a really important point.

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:08.040 position:56%
So the story of public policy toward
housing is often a story riddled

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:11.020
with, like, really big mistakes,
or that's how it's read anyways.

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:13.910
So, you know, we had a giant, like,

00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:16.810
social experiment called
public housing, which was going

00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:18.490
to replace our sum communities.

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:23.020
And we said, "Why don't we
build giant towers in the middle

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:25.280
of really poor, desolate
areas of our city?

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:29.760
Pruitt-Igoe in St. Louis,
Robert Taylor homes in Chicago.

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:31.410
And so we built these towers up,

00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:34.570
and the thing that we often
forget is, like, that was amazing.

00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:37.600 position:56%
Like, when you read the transcripts
of the first residents of those kind

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:40.030
of public housing towers, they
were like, "This is incredible.

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:41.770
This is like Christmas."

00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:43.070
But we defunded it.

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:44.990
We gutted the funding and
soon, like, no one was picking

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:46.930
up the trash and the
elevators weren't working.

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:49.250
And if you were a family
that could move out, you did,

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:53.020
and those towers descended into
incredibly concentrated poverty

00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:54.840
and sometimes even, like, chaos.

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:57.840
You know, Pruitt-Igoe, these
giant towers in St. Louis,

00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:00.300
were destroyed 18 years
after they were erected.

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:05.200
So from those ashes, the Public
Housing Voucher System started

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:10.170
to emerge, and it has become the
main way we provide affordable

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:11.910
housing to families today.

00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:14.960
It's not a perfect system, but
there's no study in the world

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:19.550
that shows that you can offer
families equal quality housing

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:22.140
for a lesser cost than you
can through a voucher program.

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:24.500
So the problem that I always
[inaudible] with when I was trying

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:26.490
to conclude this book,
like, what policy do I want

00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:29.000
to get behind, is the
problem of scale.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.440
There's all sorts of awesome
ways we can address this problem,

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:33.490
but if we want to address
it at scale,

00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:39.220
the voucher program's
the best way to do so.

00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:40.820
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] question.

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:44.340
You made a distinction between
men who are incarcerated and women

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:47.510
who lose their homes, and I just
wanted to point out that the rate

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:52.450
of female incarceration is rising
exponentially in the US right now.

00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:57.590
That aside, what could you
tell me about the landlords

00:39:57.590 --> 00:40:01.690
that would surprise me, given my
sense that these are, you know,

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:04.380
bad people or something like
-- what would, you know,

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:07.460
something that would
make me feel differently?

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:11.020
&gt;&gt; Matthew Desmond: I hope
the book does its best to try

00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:13.940
to capture both sides with
their full complexity,

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:16.470
and I think it's way too easy,
you know, just to say, "Oh,

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:17.770
these landlords are just greedy."

00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:19.070
Or, "Oh, these tenants are just
lazy," depending on where we fall

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:20.370
in the political spectrum.

00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:21.670
You know, from the sidewalk
view, it's really hard.

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:22.970
And so one thing that surprised
me was when I started this work,

00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:24.270
I was like, "Why would you buy
property on 13th Street and Keefe?"

00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:25.570
And when I finished this
work, I was like, "Oh,

00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:26.870
why wouldn't you do that?"

00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:28.170
Because you can make a lot of
money, quite a bit of money.

00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:29.470
And so, you know, the landlord of
the trailer park that I lived in,

00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:30.770
you know, he let me copy his
rent rolls, so I could account

00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:32.070
for vacancies and missed payments.

00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:33.370
I got his mortgage records,
I got his water bill,

00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:34.670
I got his trash collecting
records, I got his eviction costs.

00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:35.970
I'm telling you all this so
you believe me, that, you know,

00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:37.270
the landlord of, like,
the worst trailer park

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:38.570
in the fourth worst
city of Milwaukee,

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:39.870
which is 130-trailers big,

00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:41.170
takes home about 470,000
dollars a year after expenses.

00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:42.470
That, for me, changed the
way I think about poverty,

00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:43.800
because it means, like, poverty
isn't just about low incomes.

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.100
It's also about extractive markets.

00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:46.400
You know, there are winners and
losers, and there are losers

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.700
because there are winners.

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:49.000
And that point isn't
just about landlords.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.300
I think that point is about a
lot of us in the room today,

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:51.600 position:56%
including things like our housing
and our schools and our tax records.

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:52.900
&gt;&gt; Hey, Matt.

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:54.200
Thank you for this
great, great book.

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:55.500
I wanted to say a quick question
about the writing of the book.

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:56.800
Why did you choose not to
include yourself in the book,

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.100
despite doing the same kind of
immersive journalism as a, say,

00:40:58.100 --> 00:40:59.400
a Nickel and Dimed or
something like that?

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:00.700
Did you give it thought?

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:02.000
Did you think it would
change the story?

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.300
Or why aren't you a
character in the book?

00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:04.600
&gt;&gt; Matthew Desmond: I
gave it a ton of thought.

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:05.900
You know, Nickel and Dimed
is a first person because,

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:07.200
like, that's the idea.

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:08.500
Like, I went and I did this.

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:09.800
And I -- it is a form of immersive
journalism, or ethnography,

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.100
but it's also -- I didn't
want the reader to look at me.

00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:12.400
I didn't want the reader
to care about me.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.700
Like, I am not the
important thing in the story.

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:15.000
Arlene and Crystal and
Vanetta and Scott and Lorraine,

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.300
they're the important
people in the story.

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:17.600 position:56%
And so I didn't want, when something
was happening, you thinking,

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:18.900
"How's Matt dealing with this?"

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:20.200
Or, "Where is Matt in the story?"

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.500
I didn't want you to care,
and so I erased myself.

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:22.800
And I write about, like,
the tradeoffs of that kind

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.100
of approach in the end of the book.

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:25.400
I'm being told by the bosses
that I have to wrap it up.

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:26.700
Thank you guys so much --

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:28.000
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
