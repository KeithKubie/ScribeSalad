00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.568
(wind blowing)

00:00:01.568 --> 00:00:04.170
(solemn music)

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:12.712
(engine humming)

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:18.618
When you work with
archaeological objects,

00:00:19.252 --> 00:00:23.089
you are like entering the
world of your ancestors.

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:26.159
(mysterious music)

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:29.128
I like to think that in
a way, they talk to us.

00:00:29.128 --> 00:00:32.064
(mysterious music)

00:00:33.032 --> 00:00:37.236
A Quipu is an accounting
device made of cotton strings

00:00:37.236 --> 00:00:41.106
that used knots to
represent numbers.

00:00:41.106 --> 00:00:43.910
(mysterious music)

00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:48.381
A Quipu is the accountance
of life (laughs).

00:00:49.148 --> 00:00:51.985
(mysterious music)

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:57.890
The Quipus were made in
Inca times by Quipucamayocs.

00:00:57.924 --> 00:01:00.393
(mysterious music)

00:01:01.894 --> 00:01:04.564
The Quipucamayocs, the only
ones who were able to read it,

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:08.731
die and didn't pass the knowledge
to the next generations.

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:12.238
There's a lot of questions
still to get answered.

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:18.111
My biggest hope for Inkawasi
is to be able to excavate

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:19.379
all the site.

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:23.049
(gentle bell music)

00:01:23.182 --> 00:01:24.817
The Quipus are
very well preserved

00:01:24.817 --> 00:01:26.953
because the environment
of the Peruvian coast

00:01:26.953 --> 00:01:28.020
is very arid.

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:32.225
So you have a very
good preservation of
any organic remain.

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:34.160
(gentle bell music)

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.329
This must be 600 years old.

00:01:37.697 --> 00:01:41.401
And as you can see the
preservation is very well.

00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:43.236
(gentle bell music)

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:45.538
We know that the numbers
who found in the Quipus

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:48.107
are the counts of these product.

00:01:48.107 --> 00:01:51.110
(gentle bell music)

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:55.014
[Woman] They have been
buried for 600 years

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:57.884
and so what we do
is the conservation.

00:01:57.884 --> 00:02:02.488
That means keep them clean
and straight so the analyzer

00:02:02.488 --> 00:02:04.457
can come and study them.

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:09.095
I think this discovery would
bring a better understanding

00:02:09.095 --> 00:02:13.266
of Quipus and also in how the
Incas dominate and control

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.935
these local populations.

00:02:17.603 --> 00:02:22.641
Many people say that
because we had no writing

00:02:22.875 --> 00:02:25.378
our culture was not developed.

00:02:26.745 --> 00:02:30.349
But we really have
things like Quipus that show

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.453
that it was a very
developed culture.

00:02:35.854 --> 00:02:38.558
Every time it's exciting
because we are finding them

00:02:38.558 --> 00:02:42.462
in different contexts and
in different situations.

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:43.729
And different sizes,

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:46.232
different shapes, colors, knots.

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:49.502
So we can have a very
big data of these Quipus.

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:51.671
So we can compare them and
get any kind of insight

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:55.008
to see how to read them
or how to understand them.

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:56.676
(gentle bell music)

00:02:56.676 --> 00:03:00.146
The first one when you
see them like really dirty

00:03:00.146 --> 00:03:03.549
spaghetti and then the
end they are just like

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.186
"take me a picture," they
are so pretty.(laughs)

00:03:07.186 --> 00:03:11.357
I think the Quipus
are grateful (laughs).

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:14.961
(gentle upbeat music)

00:03:19.098 --> 00:03:20.934
(paper tearing)

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:23.269
(paper tearing)
