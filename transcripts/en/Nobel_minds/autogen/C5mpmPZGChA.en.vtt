just about one of them because of course

the physiology and medicine prize was
 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.030
the physiology and medicine prize was
given about the function of vesicles

given about the function of vesicles
 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:49.100

is very important in the sense that it's

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270
is very important in the sense that it's
 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.710
is very important in the sense that it's

up here we know almost nothing about

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860
up here we know almost nothing about
 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.010
up here we know almost nothing about
their structure how they are attached

but it's a molecule what's actually two

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259
but it's a molecule what's actually two

and then they're tied together by strand

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000
and then they're tied together by strand
 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.749
and then they're tied together by strand
to form a coiled coil which holds the

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759
to form a coiled coil which holds the
 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.710
to form a coiled coil which holds the
vesicle and what the physiology and

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720
vesicle and what the physiology and
 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.020
vesicle and what the physiology and
medicine lectures were mainly about this

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030
medicine lectures were mainly about this
 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.830
medicine lectures were mainly about this
how the vesicles open enclosed to give

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840
how the vesicles open enclosed to give
 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.620
how the vesicles open enclosed to give
to give up their cargo at just the right

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630
to give up their cargo at just the right
 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.370
to give up their cargo at just the right
time this is concerned with how they

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380
time this is concerned with how they
 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.950
time this is concerned with how they
move around and again this is a cartoon

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960
move around and again this is a cartoon
 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.540
move around and again this is a cartoon
and we'll just watch it the microtubules

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550
and we'll just watch it the microtubules
 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.270
and we'll just watch it the microtubules
down below and that

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280

two globular feet and here's a real time

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190

hundred times under thousand times white

where they kinesin molecules are

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209
where they kinesin molecules are
 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.770
where they kinesin molecules are
actually moving on the microtubule but I

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780
actually moving on the microtubule but I
 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.080
actually moving on the microtubule but I
now want to focus more specifically on

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090
now want to focus more specifically on
 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.540
now want to focus more specifically on
how kinesin functions and if you look

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550
how kinesin functions and if you look
 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.160
how kinesin functions and if you look
carefully at this you can see that

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170
carefully at this you can see that
 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.000
carefully at this you can see that
kinesin walks in the sense that we walk

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010
kinesin walks in the sense that we walk
 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.370
kinesin walks in the sense that we walk
it puts the left foot forward and then

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380
it puts the left foot forward and then
 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.470
it puts the left foot forward and then
it puts the right foot forward and then

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480
it puts the right foot forward and then
 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:02.480
it puts the right foot forward and then
the left foot forward

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490
 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:10.900
now

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910
 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.620
so that it is walking in one sense but

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630
so that it is walking in one sense but
 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.880
so that it is walking in one sense but
of course it's not surprising that um

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890
of course it's not surprising that um
 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.500
of course it's not surprising that um
this these two molecules tied together

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510
this these two molecules tied together
 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.860
this these two molecules tied together
don't walk really very well and to me

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870
don't walk really very well and to me
 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.110
don't walk really very well and to me
what the way they're walking is much

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120
what the way they're walking is much
 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.220
what the way they're walking is much
more like a person who has artificial

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230
more like a person who has artificial
 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.470
more like a person who has artificial
legs who sort of walks forward like this

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480
legs who sort of walks forward like this
 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.470
legs who sort of walks forward like this
but that a molecule molecule ER system

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480
but that a molecule molecule ER system
 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.960
but that a molecule molecule ER system
without all the things we have to make

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970
without all the things we have to make
 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.830
without all the things we have to make
our feet work and do this is amazing to

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840
our feet work and do this is amazing to
 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.870
our feet work and do this is amazing to
me
