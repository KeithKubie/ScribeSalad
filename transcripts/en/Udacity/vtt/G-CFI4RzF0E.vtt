00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.192
So now we know one hour and four minutes really equals 16 15ths hours. So, now

00:00:05.192 --> 00:00:10.950
our total time is in only the units of hours. Knowing this, what equation can

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.552
we write to solve for x? The equation needs to involve the time going upstream,

00:00:15.552 --> 00:00:19.630
the time going downstream, and the total amount of time.
