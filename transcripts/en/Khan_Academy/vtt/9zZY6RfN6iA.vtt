00:00:00.306 --> 00:00:02.073
- [Instructor] Let's say
that we have some country,

00:00:02.073 --> 00:00:04.929
let's call it Utenslandia,
that can only produce

00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:08.464
one of two goods or some
combination of them.

00:00:08.464 --> 00:00:10.547
So it can produces forks,

00:00:12.428 --> 00:00:15.508
or it could produce spoons.

00:00:15.508 --> 00:00:17.882
And so this axis is the quantity forks,

00:00:17.882 --> 00:00:19.668
this axis is the quantity of spoons

00:00:19.668 --> 00:00:21.944
and let's say that if it
puts all of its energy

00:00:21.944 --> 00:00:24.788
into forks, well it would
produce that many forks

00:00:24.788 --> 00:00:27.836
and no spoons, and but
then if tried to focus

00:00:27.836 --> 00:00:31.493
some of its energy, some
of its resources on spoons,

00:00:31.493 --> 00:00:33.850
well then it would produce fewer forks

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.882
and then the more spoons it produces,

00:00:35.882 --> 00:00:38.076
it will produce fewer and fewer forks

00:00:38.076 --> 00:00:41.706
all the way to the point that
if it only focused on spoons,

00:00:41.706 --> 00:00:42.997
well it could produce that many

00:00:42.997 --> 00:00:45.099
but then it would produce no forks.

00:00:45.099 --> 00:00:46.878
What this curve is, and we touched on it

00:00:46.878 --> 00:00:51.295
on other videos, this is the
production possibilities curve

00:00:51.295 --> 00:00:55.989
for our country of Utenslandia
that makes utensils

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.508
and obviously, most countries
are much more complex,

00:00:58.508 --> 00:01:01.100
they don't only produce some
combination of two things

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.761
but this helps us, this is a nice model

00:01:03.761 --> 00:01:06.951
for understanding what
countries might be capable of.

00:01:06.951 --> 00:01:09.754
Now one way to understand this production

00:01:09.754 --> 00:01:12.337
possibilities curve is it shows

00:01:13.256 --> 00:01:15.819
what can be efficiently
produced by this country.

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:19.711
If it efficiently utilized
all of its resources,

00:01:19.711 --> 00:01:23.488
then it will produce some
combination of forks and spoons

00:01:23.488 --> 00:01:27.217
that sit on the production
possibilities curve.

00:01:27.217 --> 00:01:28.996
So this point right over here,

00:01:28.996 --> 00:01:31.292
this combination of spoons which would be

00:01:31.292 --> 00:01:35.019
that many spoons and that many forks,

00:01:35.019 --> 00:01:38.565
this combination over here,
this would be efficient.

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:40.678
That point x would be

00:01:40.678 --> 00:01:44.537
an efficient production for Utenslandia.

00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:48.040
So at this point right over
here, let's call that point y.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.826
Now what happens if Utenslandia goes

00:01:50.826 --> 00:01:52.817
into some type of recession.

00:01:52.817 --> 00:01:56.262
For whatever reason, it's
not able to use its resources

00:01:56.262 --> 00:01:58.323
as efficiently, and we're
talking about resources,

00:01:58.323 --> 00:02:00.204
we're talking about
land, we're talking about

00:02:00.204 --> 00:02:01.849
maybe its factories, we're talking about

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:04.084
the materials it has, maybe its labor,

00:02:04.084 --> 00:02:05.445
well on that situation, let's say

00:02:05.445 --> 00:02:07.233
it was operating efficiently here

00:02:07.233 --> 00:02:09.550
but then the recession happens

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.913
and so it then it
operates right over here,

00:02:11.913 --> 00:02:14.069
let's call this point right over here z,

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.270
this would be an inefficient
use of its resources,

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.758
sitting behind the production
possibilities curve.

00:02:19.758 --> 00:02:23.739
So this is inefficient, just like that.

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.232
And so one question you might have

00:02:25.232 --> 00:02:28.199
is well what about points that are beyond

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:29.754
the production possibilities curve

00:02:29.754 --> 00:02:33.391
like point, let's just call
that point a right over there.

00:02:33.391 --> 00:02:34.946
What about that point?

00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:37.688
Well, unless you have more inputs,

00:02:37.688 --> 00:02:39.852
unless you have more land, more capital,

00:02:39.852 --> 00:02:43.111
more labor, if you don't
change the resources here,

00:02:43.111 --> 00:02:43.944
this is actually going to be

00:02:43.944 --> 00:02:47.564
an unattainable point for Utenslandia.

00:02:47.564 --> 00:02:49.372
But let's say you really wanna reach it,

00:02:49.372 --> 00:02:50.803
how can that happen?

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:53.363
Well, you can actually have investment

00:02:53.363 --> 00:02:56.431
or you could have more land or more labor.

00:02:56.431 --> 00:02:59.560
So let's think about that scenario.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.530
So let me draw the two axes.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.395
So that's my fork axis,
that's the quantity of forks

00:03:04.395 --> 00:03:06.569
that Utenslandia will produce in the year.

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.402
This will be the spoon
axis, right over there.

00:03:12.168 --> 00:03:16.557
And let's draw our original
production possibilities curve.

00:03:16.557 --> 00:03:18.304
So I'll try to make it look pretty similar

00:03:18.304 --> 00:03:20.547
to what we had before.

00:03:20.547 --> 00:03:23.078
So that's our original
production possibilities curve.

00:03:23.078 --> 00:03:24.135
Another way of thinking about it

00:03:24.135 --> 00:03:25.444
is it's showing the trade off

00:03:25.444 --> 00:03:28.097
between producing forks and spoons.

00:03:28.097 --> 00:03:29.608
You can actually think about

00:03:29.608 --> 00:03:31.693
what is the opportunity cost of producing

00:03:31.693 --> 00:03:33.989
an incremental spoon in terms of forks.

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.817
How many forks do you have to trade off

00:03:35.817 --> 00:03:37.382
because remember,
there's scarcity at play.

00:03:37.382 --> 00:03:39.708
You don't have an infinite amount of metal

00:03:39.708 --> 00:03:42.464
to produce things with, an
infinite amount of labor,

00:03:42.464 --> 00:03:44.130
an infinite amount of factories.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.871
But let's say Utenslandia,
they are able to get

00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:49.392
some more land on which
to build factories,

00:03:49.392 --> 00:03:51.342
maybe they build some more factories

00:03:51.342 --> 00:03:53.057
so capital goes up, maybe some people

00:03:53.057 --> 00:03:55.059
migrate to Utenslandia.

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:58.712
So in that situation,
you would have growth

00:03:58.712 --> 00:04:01.562
and your production possibilities curve

00:04:01.562 --> 00:04:04.560
would actually shift outward.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.601
So here, we are showing,

00:04:06.601 --> 00:04:08.339
let me make it a little bit,

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:11.042
we are showing a
situation right over here,

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:13.732
this is still a production
possibilities curve

00:04:13.732 --> 00:04:16.893
but we're showing what
happens when you have growth.

00:04:16.893 --> 00:04:19.370
And once again, what are
the drivers of growth?

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.026
Well this could be the amount
of land that you have goes up.

00:04:23.026 --> 00:04:26.939
The amount of capital
that you have goes up.

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:29.731
Capital could be things like factories,

00:04:29.731 --> 00:04:31.907
it could be machinery,

00:04:31.907 --> 00:04:36.079
you could have people, more
people are able to help produce

00:04:36.079 --> 00:04:38.032
the spoons or forks.

00:04:38.032 --> 00:04:40.723
You could just have better technology

00:04:40.723 --> 00:04:43.233
for producing spoons and forks.

00:04:43.233 --> 00:04:44.066
Sometimes people will even

00:04:44.066 --> 00:04:45.531
talk about entrepreneurial spirit,

00:04:45.531 --> 00:04:47.023
that people are able to
figure out better ways

00:04:47.023 --> 00:04:48.620
of combining these resources

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.277
so that you could produce
more spoons or forks.

00:04:52.277 --> 00:04:54.703
But let's imagine now the other scenario.

00:04:54.703 --> 00:04:58.198
Let's imagine a scenario where Utenslandia

00:04:58.198 --> 00:05:00.948
gets into a war with Platelandia.

00:05:01.913 --> 00:05:05.625
And Platelandia sends their bombers in

00:05:05.625 --> 00:05:10.461
and starts destroying some of
the factories of Utenslandia

00:05:10.461 --> 00:05:12.583
and so what will happen in that situation?

00:05:12.583 --> 00:05:14.910
So before the war, this is that production

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.121
possibilities curve for Utenslandia.

00:05:18.121 --> 00:05:21.715
But now, because of the
war, maybe Platelandia

00:05:21.715 --> 00:05:25.421
is able to take some
land from Utenslandia,

00:05:25.421 --> 00:05:29.609
maybe it's able to destroy
some of the factories

00:05:29.609 --> 00:05:31.254
and other forms of capital,

00:05:31.254 --> 00:05:35.257
maybe people flee Utenslandia
so there's less labor.

00:05:35.257 --> 00:05:37.199
And maybe for whatever reason,

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:39.361
they can support less technology

00:05:39.361 --> 00:05:41.953
or they forget how to use
some of their technology

00:05:41.953 --> 00:05:44.867
'cause the war is so long and protracted.

00:05:44.867 --> 00:05:49.034
Well in that situation, your
PPC, you would see contraction.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.842
And contraction, I could depict it,

00:05:52.842 --> 00:05:56.225
let me shift my PPC, my
production possibilities curve

00:05:56.225 --> 00:05:58.058
inward just like this.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.939
So this is a situation where
we are seeing contraction.

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:06.708
So big picture here, your
production possibilities curve

00:06:06.708 --> 00:06:08.221
is exactly what it says it is.

00:06:08.221 --> 00:06:12.162
It shows what can a, what
is the potential combination

00:06:12.162 --> 00:06:16.205
of, in this case, goods
that this nation can produce

00:06:16.205 --> 00:06:18.533
and if you're sitting on the curve,

00:06:18.533 --> 00:06:20.696
it shows that that nation, that country

00:06:20.696 --> 00:06:23.012
is efficiently using its resources.

00:06:23.012 --> 00:06:24.486
If you're sitting within the curve,

00:06:24.486 --> 00:06:26.578
it's inefficiently using its resources.

00:06:26.578 --> 00:06:28.570
And if you're on the right of the curve

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.850
or beyond the curve,
well that's a situation

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.225
where if you don't change the inputs,

00:06:34.225 --> 00:06:37.153
all else equal, this would
actually be unattainable.

00:06:37.153 --> 00:06:39.675
The way that you actually
do attain, get to points

00:06:39.675 --> 00:06:42.844
beyond the curve, is by
shifting the curve itself.

00:06:42.844 --> 00:06:45.538
By having more land,
more capital, more labor

00:06:45.538 --> 00:06:48.760
or more technology which we
see in this middle scenario.
