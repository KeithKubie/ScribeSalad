00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.760
In 1983, Paul Mockapetris proposed a distributed
database of internet name and address pairs,

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.840
now known as the Domain Name System (DNS).

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.330
This is essentially a distributed “phone
book” linking a domain’s name to its address,

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:04.550
allowing you to type in something like todayifoundout.com
instead of the IP address of the website.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.260
The distributed version of this system allowed
for a decentralized approach to this “phone

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.260
book.”

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.110
Previous to this, a central HOSTS.TXT file
was maintained at Stanford Research Institute

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.310
that then could be downloaded and used by
other systems.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.710
Even by 1983, this was becoming a problem
to maintain, which ultimately led to the Domain

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:27.710
Name System.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.380
In these Wild West days of the internet when
domain names first began to be registered

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.500
for commercial use, with symbolics.com kicking
things off when it was registered to Symbolics

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:44.649
Computer Corp. on March 15, 1985, few people
had any idea how big the internet was going

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:46.090
to be in the coming decades.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.890
As a result, the value of domain names was
underestimated to an almost comical degree.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.729
Examples of domain names that were snapped
up in the halcyon days of the early 1990s

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:05.170
by savvy internet denizens include Beer.com,
(sold in 2004 for $7 million), Hotel.com (sold

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:13.090
in 2011 for $11 million) and the subject of
today’s article- Sex.com.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.930
This particular domain was registered by one
Gary Kremen for free thanks to the National

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.400
Science Foundation footing the bill at the
time.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.290
While Kremen has run or invested in a myriad
of successful businesses since, he is perhaps

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.200
best known today as the creator of Match.com,
which presently brings in a few hundred million

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.200
dollars per year.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.970
Although, funny enough, owing to his removal
as CEO by an amazingly inept board who likewise

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.360
demonstrated a spectacular lack of vision
and undervaluation of the website, Match.com

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:50.390
was sold for a mere $7 million in 1998 (about
$10.7 million in today’s dollars), with

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.670
Kremen only getting about $50,000 of that
for his idea and effort in building the site.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.099
(A little over a year later it sold again
for about $50 million with little changes

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.330
to the site in the interim, with Kremen noting
of the previous sale that he vehemently argued

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.110
against, “Talk about mispricing.”)

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.070
But we’re not here to talk about Match.com.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:15.090
Rewinding back to 1994, Kremen, a holder of
bachelor’s degrees in computer science and

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.430
another in electrical engineering, as well
as an MBA from Stanford Business School, saw

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.960
great potential in online businesses, and
thus had made a practice of snapping up domains

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.510
that he thought would work great for various
e-businesses he had ideas for.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.890
So when he noticed sex.com was available,
he nabbed it via the registrar Internic, which

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.120
was later acquired by Network Solutions.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.480
Of course, at the time, himself having long
struggled to find a steady girlfriend, Kremen

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.930
was busy attempting to give the world of dating
a major upgrade via introducing the aforementioned

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:52.210
online dating service, match.com, so set aside
sex.com to do something with later.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.260
Important here is that when Kremen did register
sex.com, while he named his non-incorporated

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.270
company Online Classifieds as the owner of
the domain, he put himself as the sole point

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:03.310
of contact.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.270
Seemingly, this should have made it pretty
difficult for someone to steal sex.com from

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.150
him, but at the time, as noted, few people
had any real notion that domains should have

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.010
value, even, as it turns out, Network Solutions.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.161
In fact, at least according to their later
legal argument in a case with Kremen, they

00:04:19.161 --> 00:04:24.600
stated they considered domains more like phone
numbers than property someone owned.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.480
Enter Stephen Cohen.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.750
Besides supposedly having a Juris Doctor degree
from Southern California Law School, over

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.380
the course of his life Cohen’s been involved
in a shockingly high number of schemes.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.090
For example, according to a lawyer friend
of his, one Roger Agajanian, Cohen even once

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.139
successfully impersonating a judge in Colorado
for several years, including, to quote, “[letting]

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.960
people off all the time” while acting as
a judge.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.319
While he was arrested countless times over
the years for his many exploits, he was particularly

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:58.300
adept at not only staying out of jail, but
also weaseling out of actually coughing up

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:05.229
any money to people he’d defrauded and creditors
via, according to Agajanian, “playing procedural

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.470
games” and hiding acquired assets until
those he’d conned just gave up trying to

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.659
get anything out of him.

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:17.509
Fast-forwarding a bit to the late 1980s, and
an Orange Country sheriff, Gary Jones, had

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:22.590
been trying to catch Cohen at something for
years, ever since discovering he’d been

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.740
stealing expensive cars from people via pretending
to impound them when the people fell behind

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.719
on payments, as well as operating a phony
law firm.

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:35.289
During the ordeal, Cohen even allegedly had
the audacity to threaten Sheriff Jones’

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:38.361
family if he didn’t back off, which, to
quote Jones, “made it personal, so every

00:05:38.361 --> 00:05:40.910
time that guy sneezed, I knew.”

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.550
But even under such close scrutiny, he still
seemingly had little trouble keeping up his

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.220
various illegal activities.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:52.199
But in 1991, the master conman finally had
a stint in prison, at the Federal Correctional

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:57.509
Institution, Lompoc, in California, for his
involvement in a bankruptcy fraud scheme,

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:02.129
where, among other duplicitous activities,
he brazenly posed as a variety of different

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:03.219
lawyers in the case.

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:08.039
We could go on for pages on the various fascinating
activities Cohen got up to over the decades

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:12.900
as he mastered the craft of being not only
a conman but also someone who seemingly could

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.699
give the world’s top lawyers a lesson in
how to exploit the U.S. legal system to get

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:27.849
away with almost anything, but today we’re
just going to focus on one of his little escapades-

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:29.500
the sex.com heist.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.559
On February 1, 1995, Cohen was released from
prison.

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:37.469
Seemingly not long after, he set his sites
on acquiring sex.com.

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:41.009
Rather than make an offer to the rightful
owner, Kremen, to buy it or even create a

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:44.279
partnership of some sort (which actually might
have really worked out for both Cohen and

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:47.499
Kremen, as it turns out), he seems to have
decided he’d rather just steal it.

00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:52.559
To do so, he settled on an ingeniously simple
plan, which he put into motion on October

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:54.080
15, 1995.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:59.430
Cohen began by forging a letter from the president
of Kremen’s Online Classifieds, Sharon Dimmick.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.159
Using a fake, seemingly official looking letterhead,
in the letter Dimmick, on behalf of Online

00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:07.101
Classifieds, noted that Kremen had been fired
and that they were “relinquishing” all

00:07:07.101 --> 00:07:09.110
rights to Sex.com to Cohen.

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.069
Moreover, in the letter, it stated that:

00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:14.719
“Because we do not have a direct connection
to the internet, we request that you notify

00:07:14.719 --> 00:07:19.009
the internet registration {sic} on our behalf,
to delete our domain name sex.com.

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:24.279
Further, we have no objections to your use
of the domain name sexcom and this letter

00:07:24.279 --> 00:07:30.439
shall serve as our authorization to the internet
registration to transfer sex.com to your corporation.”

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:32.330
Of course, Sharon Dimmick didn’t exist,
but that didn’t matter here.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.349
When Cohen presented the letter to Network
Solutions, the latter, with remarkable credulity

00:07:34.349 --> 00:07:38.210
(particularly given that a company with “online”
in their name wouldn’t have access to the

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:41.129
internet, even in 1995), transferred the domain
to Cohen’s company, Sporting Houses Management,

00:07:41.129 --> 00:07:46.449
just two days later on October 17th, without
ever bothering to even try to contact the

00:07:46.449 --> 00:07:51.150
one person who actually was listed as a contact
and had registered the domain in the first

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:52.499
place- Gary Kremen.

00:07:52.499 --> 00:07:56.080
Kremen would later note that on October 18,
“I woke up… and it was gone…

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.960
It’s like someone forging the title to your
house and then taking it over.”

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.319
Naturally, he contacted Network Solutions
to ask what had happened and to get the domain

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:09.059
back, noting that he’d never authorized
any such transfer, but they claimed they had

00:08:09.059 --> 00:08:13.650
an internal policy to not get involved in
any dispute about ownership of domains and

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:16.030
refused to transfer it back.

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:20.319
(Presumably he’d have had much better luck
if he just wrote them a letter on Cohen’s

00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:23.259
behalf telling them to transfer the domain
back…)

00:08:23.259 --> 00:08:27.409
Of course, Cohen wasn’t about to give up
his new asset, leaving Kremen no alternative

00:08:27.409 --> 00:08:30.520
but to sue and try to get the courts to make
him.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:35.000
Beyond initially not being sure if he wanted
to so publicly associate himself with online

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.400
porn via suing Cohen for sex.com back, the
other problem was that Kremen knew the legal

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:45.060
battle would be extremely expensive and he
didn’t have the money at the time to pursue

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.060
the case.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.890
So he put it on the backburner for a while.

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:53.110
On top of this, when Kremen later began seriously
looking into suing, he was contacted by a

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:55.250
lawyer from the Patent and Trademark Office.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:09:00.970
Said lawyer advised him that suing Cohen would
be a pointless act because Cohen had trademarked

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:05.630
sex.com, retroactive to 1979 when Cohen had
first started using the term, meaning that

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:09.320
thanks to that trademark, there was almost
no chance Kremen would win, even if he had

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.320
been the one who’d originally registered
sex.com.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.761
If you’re now wondering how Cohen could
have been using sex.com all the way back in

00:09:13.761 --> 00:09:18.010
the late 1970s, he claimed on his trademark
application that he had been running an electronic

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:23.290
bulletin board called The French Connection
back in 1979, which was, to quote, a board

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:26.630
for “swingers, nudist camps, and alternative
lifestyles.”

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:30.900
Essentially a hookup electronic bulletin board
and where sex.com, supposedly short for Sex

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.010
Communications, was being used by Cohen.

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:37.550
Cohen would later claim, “It was a very,
very lucrative business.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:40.080
It’s what became Sex.com today.”

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.940
It is known that Cohen really did once run
such an electronic bulletin board service

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:49.850
and later a real-world swingers meeting place
in Orange County in the late 1980s called

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:50.960
“The Club”.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:55.300
This is definitively known, among other reasons,
because in 1990 Cohen was arrested for operating

00:09:55.300 --> 00:10:00.800
such a sex club in a residential zone, though
was later somehow found not guilty by a jury.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.910
As to whether “sex.com” ever had anything
to do with any of this, it’s generally thought

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:05.910
unlikely.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:10.480
Whatever the case, according to Kremen, while
Cohen really did file for such a trademark

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:15.030
once he acquired sex.com, it would later turn
out that the Patent and Trademark Office lawyer

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.830
Kremen had been discussing the matter with
and who for a time successfully dissuaded

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:23.910
him from attempting the lawsuit was none other
than the conman who’d stolen sex.com in

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:26.020
the first place- Stephen Cohen.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:30.170
In any event, Kremen did not initial pursue
legal action and in the interim Cohen attempted

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:35.130
to create the “Caesar’s Palace of brothels”
and even a fantasy sex island with sex.com

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:38.810
being the web presence for these business
ideas.

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:43.550
But all such plans fell through, and he simply
began offering subscription porn on sex.com,

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:46.430
as well as running very lucrative ads as well.

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:50.990
On top of that, even though he’d not actually
been granted the trademark for sex.com, he

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:55.850
nonetheless began suing everyone using related
terms in their brands and the like.

00:10:55.850 --> 00:11:00.530
As Cohen put it in an interview, “We’ve
got lawsuits filed left and right for trademark

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:01.530
infringement.

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.910
We’re constantly filing new lawsuits.

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:04.910
Constantly.

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:09.150
We have teams of lawyers at Ocean Fund who
do nothing but file lawsuits.”

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:12.760
(This seemingly actually was lucrative in
its own right, with some website owners at

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:17.120
the time simply choosing to take a deal instead
of pay all the legal fees needed to take the

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.650
matter to court.)

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:22.970
Speaking of Ocean Fund, around this same time,
Cohen sold sex.com to a company called Sand

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:27.950
Man Internacional in Mexico, a subsidiary
of Ocean Fund International, based in the

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:29.250
British Virgin Islands.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:33.560
Naturally, though the paper trail is surprisingly
difficult to follow, presumably by design,

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:38.070
it would appear this was all just a way for
Cohen to move ownership of the domain to an

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:41.770
entity, which he owned, based outside of the
United States.

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:46.290
However, Cohen’s lawsuits here would be
the beginning of his undoing in the sex.com

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:47.290
heist.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:51.160
You see, while Kremen couldn’t afford to
go after Cohen himself, Cohen was making himself

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:55.720
a lot of enemies in the world of online porn-
some of which agreed to team up with Kremen

00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:00.610
to cover legal costs of getting the sex.com
domain taken away from Cohen.

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:05.370
And so it was that in the summer of 1998,
Kremen finally decided to sue to get the domain

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:06.370
back.

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:10.280
Soon enough, however, many of the porn moguls
that agreed to go into the battle with Kremen

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:15.540
abandoned the cause, but one lawyer, Charles
Carreon, decided to stick it out with Kremen,

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.810
despite Kremen’s lack of ability to pay.

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:22.610
Later, when Cohen sued Kremen for defamation,
Carreon had the bright idea to leverage certain

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:26.940
terms in Kremen’s home owners insurance
plan with State Farm to obligate them to defend

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.780
Kremen in the defamation case.

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:33.160
With State Farm’s large team of crack lawyers
now on his side, the runaround Cohen was giving

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.930
the court system began to fall apart.

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:40.340
Around the same time, Kremen stated he was
able to “liquidate the dot-com stock I had

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.370
and put it all on red to beat [Cohen]”.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:47.130
At this point, it was personal, no doubt partially
fueled by the fact that apparently Cohen had

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:51.800
a fun little habit of randomly calling Kremen
to taunt him or otherwise just mess with him

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.300
in a variety of ways.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:57.850
Cohen didn’t help himself later when he
was caught on camera posing as one of Kremen’s

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:03.370
lawyers and stealing 113 pages of his own
bank records that Kremen’s legal team had

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:07.490
uncovered, which, by the way, apparently included
definitive records of him transferring some

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:14.490
$25 million made from sex.com offshore- and
this was just a portion of what he probably

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:15.850
actually made.

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:19.670
When this theft was revealed, for the first
time, the court system started considering

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:25.010
that maybe the smart looking, smooth talking,
Network Solutions backed Cohen wasn’t the

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:29.840
upstanding businessman he appeared to be and
the eccentric, socially awkward Kremen, who

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.400
looked pretty much as you’d expect a stereotypical
middle aged computer nerd in the 1990s to

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.140
look, might actually not be crazy.

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:39.600
But while this court battle was being waged,
as you might have guessed from that $25 million

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:45.800
figure previously stated, Cohen was making
the most of his stolen property- at its peak,

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:51.770
according to Cohen- so take this with a huge
grain of salt- earnings were around $225 million

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:57.030
per year thanks to having about 9 million
subscribers paying $25 a pop, plus additional

00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:02.130
revenues from advertising, which he claimed
brought in about $1 million per month.

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:05.370
As Cohen once bragged in an interview, “Let
me make it real simple for you.

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:06.830
Our audience is not America.

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:08.330
It’s the whole world.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:13.660
There’s only one word in the whole world
that everyone understands – sex.

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:17.290
You type the word ‘sex,’ you come to Sex.com.”

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:21.350
Of course, Cohen could have been making up
these fantastical sums, but based on estimated

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:25.940
traffic at the time, which included somewhere
in the vicinity of 140 to 700 million page

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:29.890
views per month at its peak, and revenues
that Kremen would later receive in ads when

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:35.830
he got sex.com back, it’s generally thought
Cohen made around $100 million from sex.com

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:40.170
in the five years he controlled the domain,
though given his absolute refusal to share

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:44.650
such financial records with the courts, even
when ordered, it’s difficult to say for

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:45.650
sure.

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:49.110
Whatever his real earnings, being well versed
in the law and able to afford the best lawyers

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:53.700
to boot, Cohen successfully dragged out the
case for two years, making a variety of arguments

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:57.890
such as that because Kremen’s Online Classifieds
was not an officially registered company at

00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:04.020
the time he listed it as such when acquiring
sex.com, it could not have possibly ever owned

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:05.020
sex.com.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:08.650
One of Cohen’s lawyer’s added to this,
“Thus, Online Classifieds’ allegation

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:14.760
that it was the owner of the Sex.com URL has
no basis in fact and is tantamount to perpetrating

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:15.770
a fraud.”

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:19.870
Yes, they brazenly accused Kremen of fraud
in the case…

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:24.470
Finally, in November of 2000, the courts ordered
that the ownership of sex.com should revert

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:30.030
back to Kremen and that Cohen owed Kremen
a total of $40 million of the then estimated

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:34.970
$100 million in revenue Cohen had supposedly
made in the five years he had possessed sex.com.

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:39.950
Further, the court added in an additional
$25 million punitive damage award, bringing

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:43.550
the total owed to Kremen to $65 million.

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:47.900
Naturally, Cohen had no interest in paying
a dime to Kremen.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:53.520
Although the district court “froze” Cohen’s
known assets (read: issued an order on paper),

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:57.810
this seems to have posed little impediment
to Cohen who had seemingly already planned

00:15:57.810 --> 00:15:59.660
ahead for such a contingency.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:03.440
Beyond leaving the country, he’d already
wired everything liquid to a variety of accounts

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:07.520
offshore and even stripped his real estate,
which would soon be awarded to Kremen after

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:12.940
another extended court battle, of everything
of value (including doors and toilets).

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.970
Later the mansion was vandalized directly
before Kremen was to take possession of it,

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:20.060
with it generally thought Cohen was behind
that.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:23.890
As to why Cohen officially claimed he could
not pay anything to Kremen, despite having

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:28.990
made a boatload of money off of sex.com, it
would appear directly after losing the court

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:33.520
battle all his companies had suddenly gone
completely bankrupt at the same time his own

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:37.440
personal finances also mysteriously went to
zero…

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:41.810
Although the court ordered Cohen to return
to the U.S. and show cause for his apparent

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:45.460
contempt, he ignored the order and remained
out of the country.

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:49.810
He did, however, briefly get arrested in Mexico
for trying to smuggle some money back into

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:53.650
America, but would state after being caught
that he’d simply been trying to pay back

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:58.010
Kremen as the court had ordered him too before
authorities got in the way…

00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:02.260
The trial court then declared him a fugitive
from justice and an arrest warrant was issued,

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.480
but it couldn’t be served.

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:10.630
About this time, Kremen himself posted a “Wanted”
poster with a $50,000 reward on sex.com, which

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:12.699
only played into Cohen’s hands.

00:17:12.699 --> 00:17:16.480
Cohen then claimed he not only couldn’t
return to the United States, but that the

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:21.260
arrest warrant should be rescinded because
between that and the reward for his capture,

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:25.880
the authorities and bounty hunters outside
of his Mexico residence were allegedly engaging

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:31.620
in gunfights to see who would apprehend him
– which posed a threat to his and other

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:32.620
lives.

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:35.419
The trial court was nonplussed and refused
his request.

00:17:35.419 --> 00:17:39.810
Cohen managed to keep himself out of the reach
of U.S. authorities for about five years,

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:44.860
despite, according to Kremen, regularly still
calling to taunt him over the sex.com heist

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:49.370
and even once offering Kremen shares in the
controversial file sharing system Earthstation

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:51.540
5 Cohen helped found.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:56.470
Naturally, Kremen had no interest in taking
stock in one of Cohen’s companies over actual

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:57.470
money.

00:17:57.470 --> 00:18:01.790
Things changed when Cohen was arrested in
2005 in Mexico for violating immigration laws.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:06.090
You see, Kremen had discovered that Cohen
had divorced his wife, Rosa, which meant he

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:08.600
needed a different visa to stay there.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.880
Naturally, Kremen made this fact known to
U.S. Marshals, once of which chose to pursue

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.050
the matter, resulting in Cohen being arrested
when he attempted to acquire said correct

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:15.340
visa in person.

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:19.750
You see, when standing in the immigration
office, Cohen didn’t yet have the visa,

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:24.710
so was officially in violation of Mexican
immigration laws and in a location authorities

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:25.770
knew he’d show up at.

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:29.390
And so it was that he was shipped back to
the United States where he spent a surprisingly

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:33.640
short time in prison before being released
on December 5, 2006.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:39.940
So Kremen finally got some of that money,
right?

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:44.790
Nope, Cohen claimed poverty and backed it
up with documentation showing he had no assets

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:45.930
or money to speak of.

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:49.309
Of course, sifting through the massive paper
trail of at least 12 companies around the

00:18:49.309 --> 00:18:53.670
world and various individuals, including family
members, Cohen seems to have used to hide

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:57.450
some pretty massive sums of money after his
sex.com escapade, the courts weren’t, and

00:18:57.450 --> 00:18:58.450
aren’t, buying it.

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:02.080
At least as recently as 2011, which is the
last court rulings we could find connected

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:07.240
to the case, the matter was still ongoing,
with some of the bank accounts of said people

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.370
closely connected to Cohen, and containing
some rather enormous sums of money, having

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:10.370
been frozen.

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:13.250
In terms of whether Kremen would actually
ever get access to the many millions of dollars

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:17.390
in said frozen accounts, let alone the millions
more Cohen is thought to have stashed around

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:20.150
in unknown accounts, this is still up in the
air.

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:21.870
But Kremen states he told Cohen during one
of the conversations he’s had with him when

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:27.350
Cohen calls to taunt, “I tell him it’s
going to happen with or without lube, so lie

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:29.780
down and get it over with…”

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:33.140
To date, however, he’s still waiting on
the now over $80 million owed here including

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:34.140
interest.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.530
But don’t feel too bad for Kremen.

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:38.450
You see, beyond eventually getting to run
his own version of sex.com, making a cool

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:41.760
half a million dollars per month from it before
the dot.com bubble burst, and later selling

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:48.830
it for $14 million in 2006 ($17.5 million
today), there was still the matter of Network

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:54.870
Solutions who had transferred ownership of
his very valuable property without ever notifying

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:57.450
him in any way they were doing this.

00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:02.460
Thus, he set his sites on Network Solutions
and its parent company, VeriSign, who acquired

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:07.220
Network Solutions for a whopping $21 billion
in 2000.

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:13.340
He alleged four causes of action in this particular
law suit, including breach of contract and

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:15.870
conversion (taking someone’s property).

00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:20.050
The trial court rejected the breach of contract
claims because Kremen never paid for the domain

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:24.610
name registration (again, back then you could
register for free thanks to the National Science

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:30.260
Foundation), so there was no “consideration,”
that is, something of value Kremen paid in

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.990
exchange for the domain name.

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:35.200
This was upheld on appeal.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:39.431
Network Solutions also argued, with some success
initially, that it was akin to a phone company,

00:20:39.431 --> 00:20:42.790
with domain names essentially being phone
numbers.

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:47.800
As a lawyer for Network Solutions, Phil Sbarbaro,
stated, “A domain name is not property,

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.190
it’s a service.”

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:53.290
However, the trial court’s rejection of
the conversion claim was overturned by the

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:54.290
Court of Appeals.

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:59.020
The Ninth Circuit noted that while traditionally
the tort of conversion only applied to tangible

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:03.710
items (like a car), but not intangible things
(like information or the right to enforce

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:08.850
a license or registration), this was an old-fashioned
view of property and its value; accordingly,

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:13.900
the appellate court reversed the trial court’s
rejection and returned the claim, ruling that

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:18.140
Network Solutions was indeed liable for damages
here owing to having transferred ownership

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:20.780
of property without any authorization.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:24.740
This was a landmark case as, from a legal
perspective, many of the laws pertaining to

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:30.100
real property now applied to domains, finally
affording domain owners some concrete legal

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:32.200
protections concerning their property.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.990
Within a year, Kremen and VeriSign settled
the claim, reportedly for an amount in excess

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:40.410
of $15 million ($20.5 million today).

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:45.980
Then, of course, there was the matter of Kremen’s
sale of jobs.com, housing.com, autos.com,

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:52.380
sex.net, computer.com, a sale of a patent
he held for dynamic web pages for a cool $1.25

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:56.940
million, and money made from several companies
he created and sold in the last few decades.

00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:02.240
On top of that, Cohen’s former 8,900 square
foot mansion in Rancho Sante Fe that was awarded

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:06.870
to Kremen, which he lived in for a time, sold
for $4 million in 2009.

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:09.780
He also has variously been awarded other bits
and pieces of Cohen’s assets when they can

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:11.810
be tracked down and after lengthy legal battles
in which Cohen does everything possible to

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:12.900
drag things out as long as he can.

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:17.190
On that note, Kremen has stated he’s not
yet gotten enough back in said liquid assets

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:21.920
to pay his legal fees (in excess of $5 million)
throughout the saga.

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:26.600
More recently, Kremen’s taken to investing
in dozens of renewable energy startups.

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:34.100
So ya, financially, he’s doing alright despite
not having the $65 million plus interest Cohen

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:35.100
owes him.

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:38.820
By all accounts the two still semi-regularly
converse though, generally in the form of

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:43.290
taunting one another over the latest events
in their joined, sordid saga.

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:48.680
Money isn’t everything and despite his enormous
success over the years, Kremen was still in

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:53.390
search of love well over a decade after getting
fed up with 900 number dating services and

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:56.750
deciding to found Match.com to solve the problem
for people such as himself.

00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:00.980
As you might imagine, as a very rich bachelor
in Southern California, particularly one who

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:06.230
used to own and run a quasi-porn site in sex.com,
he had little trouble finding women wanting

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:09.160
to spend as much time with him as he liked.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:14.490
But by his mid 40s, fed up with that lifestyle,
and instead wanting someone who’d love him

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:19.140
for him and not the size of his wallet, he
offered his friends a deal- if one of them

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:23.480
could find him a wife, he’d give said finder
and family an all expense paid trip to Hawaii.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:27.470
This actually worked and he was introduced
to one Dr. Petia Atanassova, who became Petia

00:23:27.470 --> 00:25:28.020
Kremen when they got married in 2008…

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:32.929
Unfortunately it would appear according to
court records that on January 29, 2014, the

00:25:32.929 --> 00:25:37.580
couple filed for divorce, though the case
is still ongoing over four years later…

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:41.330
But there too, it’s not all bad news, he
did have two great kids in the interim.

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:44.929
And speaking of kids, while he might not have
made much money off of Match.com, thanks to

00:25:44.929 --> 00:25:50.320
it, Kremen has boasted he was able to help
make over a million babies… indirectly of

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.770
course.

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:57.340
As previously noted, Companies in the early
1990s were often so ignorant of the internet

00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:02.300
as a whole, let alone its potential as a tool
for advertising, sales and PR, that in the

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:08.500
latter days of 1993 about half of all Fortune
500 companies had failed to even register

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.470
their own name online.

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:13.950
Companies started to cotton on to the value
of domain names and the internet in the latter

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:19.800
days of 1994 when a writer for Wired magazine
called Joshua Quittner registered McDonalds.com

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:25.550
and, in a fascinating time capsule of an article,
jokingly mentioned he might try to sell McDonalds.com

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:26.809
to Burger King.

00:26:26.809 --> 00:26:30.870
Before registering the domain, Quittner repeatedly
reached out to McDonald’s to politely inform

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:34.860
them that the domain was available and they
needed to grab it quickly before someone else

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:35.860
did.

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:39.920
At Quittner’s urging, Jane Hulbert of McDonald’s
media relations discussed the matter with

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:40.970
higher ups in the company.

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:41.970
The result?

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:42.970
Hulbert stated her superiors’ reaction to
her queries about McDonald’s plans concerning

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:44.080
the internet and the McDonald’s domain name
was, “No one seems to know anything about

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.160
[the internet]…”

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:49.510
Quittner ultimately decided to just register
McDonalds.com himself, even though it wasn’t

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:54.190
yet clear from a legal standpoint if this
constituted trademark infringement or not,

00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:57.250
something that was at the time still being
fleshed out in court.

00:26:57.250 --> 00:27:01.360
(He did ultimately give the domain to McDonald’s
after the company agreed to provide free high-speed

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.750
internet to a public school in Brooklyn.)

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:08.500
Quittner likewise reached out to Burger King
encouraging them to register BurgerKing.com

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:09.840
before someone else did.

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:13.580
He stated Burger King’s initial response
when he mentioned the internet was, “[Is

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:51.130
that] some kind of information thing, like
Prodigy?”
