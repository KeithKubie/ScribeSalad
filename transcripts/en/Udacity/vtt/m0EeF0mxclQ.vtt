00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.830
And to this SVG, we can begin inserting shapes.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.190
Let us revisit what we know about visual encodings, and try to

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:12.300
recreate one circle from the Gapminder Wealth &amp; Health of Nations example.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.190
Let us start by trying to recreate the circle that represents China.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:24.413
As you can see here, China has a life expectancy of 75 years and

00:00:24.413 --> 00:00:29.486
income per person, GDP per capita of 8,347 and

00:00:29.486 --> 00:00:33.534
a total population of 1.35 billion.

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:38.160
When faced with creating any visualization based on data,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.431
you need to figure out a way to transform data values, in this case,

00:00:43.431 --> 00:00:47.964
life expectancy of 75, income per person of 8347,

00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:52.690
into the appropriate coordinates on the x and y plane.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.650
Since we're building a visualization in the browser,

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.810
we often have to map the values of our data to pixel values.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:06.320
Since D3 was created exactly for this purpose, it has many convenience functions

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.040
for converting data values into its corresponding pixel value.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.550
The most commonly used functions for

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.820
this purpose in D3 can be found in the d3.scale module.
