00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.110
The Grand Canyon.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.193
Enormous,

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:06.963
iconic,

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:08.823
breathtaking.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.450
2019 marks Grand Canyon National
Park's 100th anniversary.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.273
But how did it get to be
such a beloved destination.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.200
Archeological artifacts
suggest that people lived

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.250
in and around the canyon
some 12,000 years ago.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.410
Today, it's still
considered a sacred place

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.380
to 11 Native American tribes,

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.533
despite being moved on to
reservations in the 1800's.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.330
The United States didn't
really explore the area

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.150
until the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.950
seated over 500,000 square
miles of land to the US.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.493
Including the Grand Canyon.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.030
So, in 1857 the US
government sent an expedition

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.283
led by Lieutenant Joseph Ives
to explore the Colorado River.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.417
While Ives admired the scenery
in his report he wrote,

00:00:57.417 --> 00:01:00.977
"The region is, of course,
altogether valueless.

00:01:00.977 --> 00:01:03.827
"Ours has been the first, and
will doubtless be the last,

00:01:03.827 --> 00:01:06.767
"party of whites to visit
this profitless locality."

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.920
History proved Ives wrong,
but throughout the late 1800's

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.560
companies struggled to
make the area profitable.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.580
And few were considering
this harsh landscape

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.373
as a tourist destination.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.930
Even so, President Benjamin Harrison

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.510
saw the need to protect
this inspiring place,

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.090
and created the Grand Canyon
National Forest Reserve

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.383
in 1893.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.320
The Grand Canyon's popularity
grew tremendously after that.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.790
In 1901, a new rail line ran directly

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.430
to the Grand Canyon Village

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.030
where most tourists, to
this day, start their visit.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.620
A comfortable train ride, and
the brand new El Tovar hotel

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.680
enticed the elite class
to visit the Grand Canyon.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.863
Including President Theodore Roosevelt,

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.750
during his 1903 visit he
emphasized the importance

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.747
of preserving the Grand
Canyon in a speech,

00:01:59.747 --> 00:02:04.107
"Leave it as it is. You cannot
improve on it; not a bit.

00:02:04.107 --> 00:02:08.530
"The ages have been at work on
it, and man can only mar it."

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.810
And, in 1908 Roosevelt
declared the Grand Canyon

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.393
a national monument.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.180
During this time, more visitors made use

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.680
of the traditional Native
American walking trails

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.633
like, the Bright Angel Trail,
for mule rides and hiking.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.683
And more people meant more lodging.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.570
Architect Mary Elizabeth Jane Colter

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.190
was hired to design many of the parks

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.683
most iconic buildings.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.730
Her ground breaking
work earned the nickname

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.733
Grand Canyon's architect.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.170
And finally three years after

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.620
the National Park Service was created.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.480
On February 26th, 1919,

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.750
President Woodrow Wilson

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.550
signed the Grand Canyon National Park

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.313
into law, making it the
nation's 17th national park.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.160
Over 37,000 people visited
the newly enshrined park

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.453
in its first year.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.853
Today, the park has hosted
more than 211 million guests.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.463
But all this momentum led
to some growing pains.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.243
Commercial flights,

00:03:11.243 --> 00:03:13.720
which were gaining
popularity in the 1950's,

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.340
would treat passengers to
a view of the Grand Canyon

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.343
while en route to their destination.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.010
This led to disaster in June of 1956

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.820
when two commercial planes
crashed over the Grand Canyon,

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.550
killing all 128 people on board.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.600
It was the deadliest aviation
disaster of the time,

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.740
and motivated congress
to regulate the then

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.673
largely uncontrolled skies.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.140
The 21st century has brought
its own set of challenges.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.270
Helicopter tours have increased so much,

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.250
that a part of the canyon

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.243
has been nicknamed helicopter alley.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.470
And development companies are proposing

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.020
new retail and lodging,

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.850
which might interrupt the
natural beauty of the canyon.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.930
But, conservationists and Native Americans

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.860
are fighting to preserve the
natural integrity of the park,

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.610
just like they have in the past,

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.533
for future generations to enjoy.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.560
Through it all, the Grand Canyon

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.470
has solidified itself in the hearts

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.280
and minds of Americans.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.450
And to this day, it's
one of the most visited

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.523
national parks in the country.
