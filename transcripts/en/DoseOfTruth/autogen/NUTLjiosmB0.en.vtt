that's rumination because it's it's an

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450
that's rumination because it's it's an
 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.240
that's rumination because it's it's an
automatic process it's an unconscious

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250
automatic process it's an unconscious
 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.310
automatic process it's an unconscious
process then you know that the balance

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320
process then you know that the balance
 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.960

there's so much chaos and pain in their

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230
there's so much chaos and pain in their
 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.729
there's so much chaos and pain in their
life

become dysregulated that it's starting

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379
become dysregulated that it's starting
 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.020
become dysregulated that it's starting
to pop up into consciousness and

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030
to pop up into consciousness and
 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.140
to pop up into consciousness and
dominate it so now the in yang symbol is

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150
dominate it so now the in yang symbol is
 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.610
dominate it so now the in yang symbol is
interesting for a variety of other

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620
interesting for a variety of other
 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.759
interesting for a variety of other
reasons too because the taoist believed

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769
reasons too because the taoist believed
 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.360
reasons too because the taoist believed
that that symbol represents being now

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370
that that symbol represents being now
 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.339
that that symbol represents being now
being is not the same thing as objective

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349
being is not the same thing as objective
 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.460
being is not the same thing as objective
reality being is what you experience as

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470
reality being is what you experience as
 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.710
reality being is what you experience as
a conscious creature that's being and

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720
a conscious creature that's being and
 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.289
a conscious creature that's being and
for the Taoist being is made up of these

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299
for the Taoist being is made up of these
 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.899
for the Taoist being is made up of these
two elements order and chaos and the

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909
two elements order and chaos and the
 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:46.009
two elements order and chaos and the
reason for that it's quite

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019
reason for that it's quite
 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.420
reason for that it's quite
straightforward the reason for that is

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430
straightforward the reason for that is
 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.210
straightforward the reason for that is
wherever you go and whenever you live

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220
wherever you go and whenever you live
 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.330
wherever you go and whenever you live
and whoever you are each environment

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340
and whoever you are each environment
 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.069
and whoever you are each environment
that you're in is composed of things you

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079
that you're in is composed of things you
 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.319
that you're in is composed of things you
understand and things that work the way

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329
understand and things that work the way
 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.750
understand and things that work the way
you expect them to and things you do not

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760
you expect them to and things you do not
 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.180
you expect them to and things you do not
understand and that can be that can pull

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190
understand and that can be that can pull
 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.130
understand and that can be that can pull
the rug out from you at any moment and

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140
the rug out from you at any moment and
 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.229
the rug out from you at any moment and
so you can say in some sense that these

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239
so you can say in some sense that these
 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.869
so you can say in some sense that these
symbolic representations are

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879
symbolic representations are
 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.030
symbolic representations are
representations of the most unchanging

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040
representations of the most unchanging
 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.880
representations of the most unchanging
elements of being so the most real

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890
elements of being so the most real
 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.920
elements of being so the most real
things because you know a typical modern

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930
things because you know a typical modern
 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.420
things because you know a typical modern
person look at this and think well those

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430
person look at this and think well those
 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.699
person look at this and think well those
aren't real it's like they are real in

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709
aren't real it's like they are real in
 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.800
aren't real it's like they are real in
fact they're hyper real because one of

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810
fact they're hyper real because one of
 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.199
fact they're hyper real because one of
the things that defines real is that

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209
the things that defines real is that
 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.479
the things that defines real is that
it's permanent and it is permanent no

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489
it's permanent and it is permanent no
 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:27.860
it's permanent and it is permanent no
matter where you go there are things you

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870
matter where you go there are things you
 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.210
matter where you go there are things you
know and things you don't know and it

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220
know and things you don't know and it
 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.440
know and things you don't know and it
doesn't matter who you are it's

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450
doesn't matter who you are it's
 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.909
doesn't matter who you are it's
permanent so it's part of the

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:31.919
permanent so it's part of the
 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:35.720
permanent so it's part of the
existential landscape of human being now

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730
existential landscape of human being now
 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.069
existential landscape of human being now
the other thing that's there's two other

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079
the other thing that's there's two other
 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.420
the other thing that's there's two other
things that are quite cool about the

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430
things that are quite cool about the
 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.300
things that are quite cool about the
yin-yang symbol and one is that the each

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310
yin-yang symbol and one is that the each
 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.159
yin-yang symbol and one is that the each
of the the black pays he has a little

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169
of the the black pays he has a little
 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:44.689
of the the black pays he has a little
white dot in it and the white Paisley

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:44.699
white dot in it and the white Paisley
 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:46.250
white dot in it and the white Paisley
has a little black dot in it and the

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260
has a little black dot in it and the
 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.960
has a little black dot in it and the
reason for that is the Daoists also

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970
reason for that is the Daoists also
 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.240
reason for that is the Daoists also
recognized quite well that chaos could

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250
recognized quite well that chaos could
 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.460
recognized quite well that chaos could
turn to order at any moment you know so

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470
turn to order at any moment you know so
 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.229
turn to order at any moment you know so
a new order can arise out of a chaotic

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239
a new order can arise out of a chaotic
 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.059
a new order can arise out of a chaotic
structure that's like a that's a

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069
structure that's like a that's a
 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.789
structure that's like a that's a
revolution in some sense but by the same

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799
revolution in some sense but by the same
 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.740
revolution in some sense but by the same
token if you're in a place that's

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750
token if you're in a place that's
 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.360
token if you're in a place that's
orderly and predictable something can

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370
orderly and predictable something can
 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.009
orderly and predictable something can
happen that casts you into a chaotic

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019
happen that casts you into a chaotic
 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.839
happen that casts you into a chaotic
situation right away so there's a

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849
situation right away so there's a
 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.849
situation right away so there's a
dynamic even though these two things

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859
dynamic even though these two things
 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.890
dynamic even though these two things
oppose each other in some sense there's

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900
oppose each other in some sense there's
 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.720
oppose each other in some sense there's
a continual dynamic interplay between

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730
a continual dynamic interplay between
 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.939
a continual dynamic interplay between
them and then the final thing that's

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:13.949
them and then the final thing that's
 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:16.009
them and then the final thing that's
quite interesting about this symbol this

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019
quite interesting about this symbol this
 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.830
quite interesting about this symbol this
is a mind-boggling Lee brilliant idea is

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840
is a mind-boggling Lee brilliant idea is
 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.409
is a mind-boggling Lee brilliant idea is
that because the dao also means the way

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419
that because the dao also means the way
 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.279
that because the dao also means the way
and the way is the line between the two

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:24.289
and the way is the line between the two
 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:27.410
and the way is the line between the two
and so what that indicates is

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420
and so what that indicates is
 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.050
and so what that indicates is
is a brilliant idea is that the optimal

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060
is a brilliant idea is that the optimal
 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.750
is a brilliant idea is that the optimal
position for a human being isn't in

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760
position for a human being isn't in
 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.690
position for a human being isn't in
chaos or in order because if it's too

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700
chaos or in order because if it's too
 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.910
chaos or in order because if it's too
much order then it's totalitarian and if

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920
much order then it's totalitarian and if
 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.190
much order then it's totalitarian and if
it's too much chaos then its disgust and

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200
it's too much chaos then its disgust and
 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.340
it's too much chaos then its disgust and
fear and emotional pain and depression

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350
fear and emotional pain and depression
 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.590
fear and emotional pain and depression
so where's the proper place and the

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600
so where's the proper place and the
 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.470
so where's the proper place and the
Daoist answer is right on the line where

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480
Daoist answer is right on the line where
 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.090
Daoist answer is right on the line where
you have one foot in order so that

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100
you have one foot in order so that
 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.800
you have one foot in order so that
you're fairly stable and you have

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810
you're fairly stable and you have
 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.900
you're fairly stable and you have
another foot in chaos so that new and

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910
another foot in chaos so that new and
 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.640
another foot in chaos so that new and
interesting and compelling and

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650
interesting and compelling and
 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.320

transforming things are happening to you

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330
transforming things are happening to you
 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.360
transforming things are happening to you
and one of the things that you might

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370
and one of the things that you might
 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.820
and one of the things that you might
note is that your nervous system

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830
note is that your nervous system
 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.010
note is that your nervous system
basically tells you when you're there

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020
basically tells you when you're there
 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.710
basically tells you when you're there
and the way it tells you is by making

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720
and the way it tells you is by making
 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.210
and the way it tells you is by making
you interested in whatever it is that

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220
you interested in whatever it is that
 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.550
you interested in whatever it is that
you're engaged in because the fact that

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560
you're engaged in because the fact that
 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.800
you're engaged in because the fact that
the thing that you're engaged in grips

the thing that you're engaged in grips
 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.020
the thing that you're engaged in grips

it's something that happens to you is
 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.270
it's something that happens to you is
because your nervous system which is

chaos and order is telling you that if
 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.860
chaos and order is telling you that if
you're engaged and interested you are at

you're engaged and interested you are at
 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.960
you're engaged and interested you are at
in the place where the balance between

in the place where the balance between
 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.540
in the place where the balance between
chaos and order is is perfect now you

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550
chaos and order is is perfect now you
 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.750
chaos and order is is perfect now you
think about that it's no use reading a

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760
think about that it's no use reading a
 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.760
think about that it's no use reading a
paper that you cannot understand at all

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770
paper that you cannot understand at all
 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.680
paper that you cannot understand at all
even though hypothetically that would be

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690
even though hypothetically that would be
 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.900
even though hypothetically that would be
a tremendously informative paper right

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910
a tremendously informative paper right
 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.880
a tremendously informative paper right
but you can't understand it because it's

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890
but you can't understand it because it's
 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.800
but you can't understand it because it's
all chaos to you and then there's

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810
all chaos to you and then there's
 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.860
all chaos to you and then there's
absolutely no reason reading a paper the

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870
absolutely no reason reading a paper the
 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.230
absolutely no reason reading a paper the

the information out of it it's going to
be boring okay so what do you want well

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:55.950
be boring okay so what do you want well
 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:57.290
be boring okay so what do you want well
you want a paper that you can almost

you want a paper that you can almost
 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.530
you want a paper that you can almost
understand so there's you know your the

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:00.540
understand so there's you know your the
 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.390
understand so there's you know your the
frameworks the cognitive frameworks that

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400
frameworks the cognitive frameworks that
 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.420
frameworks the cognitive frameworks that
you have at hand are sufficient for you

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430
you have at hand are sufficient for you
 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:06.980
you have at hand are sufficient for you
to take the next step into the unknown

to take the next step into the unknown
 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.710
to take the next step into the unknown
and the paper will will inform you of

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720
and the paper will will inform you of

and the paper will will inform you of
that and so those are the sorts of
