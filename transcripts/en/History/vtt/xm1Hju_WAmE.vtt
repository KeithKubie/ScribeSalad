00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.040
[music playing]

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.460
You know, just about
every car guy has found

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:04.330
themselves in this
position, man, that Brann

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:05.960
has found himself in.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.290
His Cadillac, Twinkletoes,
needed some work done on it.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.670
He found a guy, laid
out a pile of money.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.880
Car's in no better shape
than it was before.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.460
So he brought the car to us.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.210
We can't go back in
time and fix the old,

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.880
but we can certainly
fix this Cadillac

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.670
and make it gorgeous
just like Brann wanted.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.250
I know he was a
little nervous handing

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.500
the car over again
to another shop, man,

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.080
but this baby is beautiful.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.250
And he's here today to get
reunited with Twinkletoes.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.080
Ryan, my man, bring
out Twinkletoes!

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.500
[music playing]

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.080
Oh-ho, even from the front!

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.000
Ho-ho!

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.170
[laughing]

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.080
Oh, damn!

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.420
Oh, [bleep]!

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.420
Oh, my god!

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.000
DANNY (VOICEOVER):
Brann's Cadillac was

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.500
a really great car that
just had some bad luck, man.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.670
We took that blue base, stripped
it down, and started all over.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.250
After straightening
out the body,

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.000
Ryan created a paint design
that would make this Caddy

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.500
dazzle with extreme pimpness.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.540
We freshened up that
engine and transmission

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.120
and added new brakes and
suspension components.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.580
Polly went crazy on the custom
blue and white zodiac interior

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.290
and the vinyl top.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.460
Lastly, the etched windshield in
tribute to Brann's manager Nick

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.960
on the trunk lid put this
project over the top.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.710
I absolutely love how
this car turned out, man.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.460
This ride is cool, clean,
and fit for a rock star.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.290
[stuttering]

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.620
My mind is absolutely blown.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.250
This is insane.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.960
Oh, dude.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.380
There he is.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.620
Very controversial.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.960
Let's talk about
that for a sec

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.790
while we got you right here.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.080
Yeah, that's my
boy, Nick John.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.880
One of our best
friends, our manager.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.620
Just one of our very,
very closest friends.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.750
Unfortunately, passed away,
like, a week and a half ago.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:48.920
So sorry for that loss.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.460
Yeah.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.000
And so I said, man, it
would be the coolest tribute

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.330
to have one of his catchphrases
that everybody that

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.920
knows him and loves him knows--

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.670
very controversial-- put
on the car somewhere.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.120
So that looks
absolutely perfect,

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.670
and it just warms
my heart to see it.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.830
And so happy that I'll be able
to take him to the restaurant

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.000
too.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.830
Keep him with
you all the time.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.750
Yeah, all the time.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.170
And Ryan-- jeez!

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.960
[laughing]
Dude.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.250
This car.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.790
I have to give props
to the body shop,

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.830
because this is
not a little car.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.170
This is not like a Chevette.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.460
This is, like, 10 miles
of car altogether.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.500
Yeah, that's about--

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.540
I think about 20 feet of steel.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.710
And this sucker is straight.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.880
The body lines are sharp
enough to cut your arms off.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.540
So sick!
- Uh-huh.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.290
Uh-huh.
- I love this.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.880
I've never even seen this
kind of detail before.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.040
Originally, you wanted
lots and lots of flake.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.380
Yeah, yeah.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.040
But with the baby
blue, lots of flakes

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.790
just seemed a little too much.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.040
So I gave it the proper sprinkle
of flake in the right places

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.120
to where it really catches
your eye rather than it

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.540
just being a disco ball.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.040
I didn't necessarily
do patterns.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.380
I didn't really do scallops.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.380
I just kind of did both
a blend of the two.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.170
- So Twinkletoe's up there.
- Yeah.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.210
Dude, dude, that's
etched in the glass.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.460
- Are you kidding me?
- That's not a sticker me

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.710
That's not a sticker.
That's etched.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:05.540
Dude!

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.120
That is so sick.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.750
I'm gonna get straight
up harassed in Atlanta.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.830
[laughing]
- Yes, you will.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:12.880
You will be harassed.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.040
You are, you are.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.540
I want you to see
under the hood.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.250
You're gonna love this,
because everything

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.330
is like a factory Cadillac.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.210
Wow.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.080
Everything is original.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.540
It smells like a new engine.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.250
Absolutely.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.580
Kevin, why don't you shoe him
some of the interior over here.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.210
- Yeah.
- I'll drop the hood down.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.420
Come check this.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.380
[laughing] Yeah, man!
Yes.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.880
Look at this man in this car.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.580
You look so proper in this car.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.580
Feeling good in there?

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.080
Oh, yeah.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.920
- Sparkly enough for you?
- Oh, yeah.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.540
[laughing]

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.250
There you go.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.920
There you go, lean back.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.250
Get that lean, baby!

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.080
Come on.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.380
[laughing]

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.960
Amazing.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.420
I'll hit the button, if
you guys will grab the trunk.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.290
The 70 has a lot
of little things.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.210
Whoa.

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.420
Bam!

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.620
Plenty of room
for all your stuff.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.920
Amazing.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.290
Thump.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.620
This is just blowing
my mind completely.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.710
You guys have done it again.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:08.710
That's what we like to hear.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:09.790
It's amazing.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.790
This makes me so, so happy.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.750
And in less than
10 years, right?

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.120
Yeah, you did it in
less than 10 years.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.460
- Not bad.
- That's commendable.

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.210
[laughing]

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:20.790
Let's do this, man.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.960
Let's go to the office, let's
get your paperwork done.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:24.960
Yes, paperwork.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.620
Twinkletoes is going home.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.120
(SINGING) Twinkletoes.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.170
[laughing]

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.920
You know, it's
always great help

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.670
a car lover get out of a jam.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.330
And it's even cooler when
that car lover happens to be

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.460
a Grammy award winning rocker.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.830
It just makes it better.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.170
Is it OK if Ryan puts
it back in the garage?

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.960
You know what?
I'm gonna leave it right here.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.580
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it's ready to go.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.120
Let's just sit there and
look at it for a while, man.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.250
Pull up a chair, crack a
cold one, stare at a car.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.080
Absolutely.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.960
That's what to do.
