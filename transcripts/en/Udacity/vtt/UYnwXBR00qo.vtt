00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now, we have a function that depends on two variables.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The temperature depends on time as well as on position.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The typical way to visualize this is to use a 3-dimensional drawing.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
For every time and every position, we go up by the value of the function, and so in the end,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
we get some kind of curve surfers that describes the function.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The partial derivative with respect to time computes the rate of

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
change as time increases, but we leave x constant.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The slope of this tangent line is the partial derivative with respect to time.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The partial derivative with respect to x keeps the time constant

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and only looks at what happens when we change x towards the slope of such a line.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
In the end, it boils down to computing regular derivatives and simply leaving

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
all the variables fixed that are not mentioned.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
If you form the partial derivative with respect to T, we treat x as though it was a constant.

00:00:56.000 --> 09:59:59.000
If you form the partial derivative with respect to x, you treat T as though it was a constant.
