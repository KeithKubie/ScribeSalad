00:00:01.868 --> 00:00:04.637
- Guys, Macaulay Culkin
is back, I'm so excited.

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:06.139
(audience cheers)

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:09.609
I know, it is not Home Alone
6, My Parents are now Deceased.

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:10.443
(audience laughs)

00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:13.113
He is, (laughs)

00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:15.882
They would be, they'd be
super old now, you guys,

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:18.251
they'd be super old.

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:19.753
- [Doug] Catherine
O'Hara is alive.

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:20.920 align:start size:69% position:31%
- What?
- Nothing.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.355
(audience laughs)

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:23.857 align:start size:97% position:3%
- No, I mean, I'm not talking
about Catherine O'Hara,

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:25.625 align:start size:97% position:3%
I'm talking about the actual
family, The McCallisters,

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:27.794
because Home Alone was
a documentary, Doug.

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:29.295
(audience laughs)

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:32.198
But Macaulay Culkin is now
in a pizza-themed cover band

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:35.769 align:start size:94% position:6%
that just released the
premiere video on MUZU.TV.

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:38.671 align:start position:0%
Comedians, what is this
pizza-themed cover band called?

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:42.208 align:start size:84% position:16%
Is it A, The Red Hot
Chili Pepperonis?

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:44.344
B, The Pizza Underground?

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:46.112
C, The Mamas and the Papa Johns?

00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:47.180 align:start size:81% position:19%
(bell rings)
(audience laughs)

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.481
Moshe Kasher.

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:50.583
- It happens to be B,
The Pizza Underground

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:52.652 align:start size:97% position:3%
because I have bought
every CD they've ever made,

00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:54.120
which is not even one.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.122 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Chris] Well, that is
correct, The Pizza Underground

00:00:56.122 --> 00:01:00.393
is the correct answer.
(cheers and applause)

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:04.364 align:start size:81% position:19%
It is a Velvet
Underground-themed
pizza cover band.

00:01:04.364 --> 00:01:06.066
Do we have some video of that?

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.568
(kazoo music)

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:16.342
Lou Reed was so upset to not
have kazoo in the original

00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:18.244 align:start size:84% position:16%
Walk on the Wild Side.
(laughs)

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:21.815 align:start size:97% position:3%
And, can I point out that
the big news about this video

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:23.216
is that Kevin McCallister

00:01:23.216 --> 00:01:25.585 align:start size:84% position:16%
finally got his very
own cheese pizza.

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:28.054
(laughs and applause)

00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:31.891
He's just playing
a kazoo through it.

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:33.960 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Doug] And then he
decided to decorate with it?

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.528
(laughs)

00:01:35.528 --> 00:01:36.763
- He didn't say he
was gonna eat it,

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:38.398
he just wanted to
put it on his face.

00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:40.967 align:start position:0%
- [Doug] His band should be
called The Wet Bandits, I think.

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:42.535
(Chris laughs)

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:44.571
- [Chris] No, Doug,
that's not cool, man.

00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:46.139
They tortured that kid,

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:47.874
that's why they sat on those
Christmas ornaments outside,

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:49.375
to ruin them.

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:52.912 align:start size:97% position:3%
Is this a good move for
Macaulay Culkin career-wise?

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:54.047 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Pizza on his face?
- Yeah!

00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:56.182
(laughs)

00:01:56.182 --> 00:01:58.852
- Well, I guess when
you put it that way.

00:01:58.852 --> 00:02:01.121
It's an awesome idea.

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:02.422 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Moshe] He went
from dating Mila Kunis

00:02:02.422 --> 00:02:05.992
to just being a pizza
face, it's a good move.

00:02:05.992 --> 00:02:08.995
- [Doug] Take that,
ya filthy animal
