about it and you start acquiring more
and more both a lot of images and then a

00:52:58.230 --> 00:52:58.240
and more both a lot of images and then a
 

00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:02.370

lot of other what about the the other
 

00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:05.039
lot of other what about the the other
dots on the map I mean if you could help

00:53:05.039 --> 00:53:05.049
dots on the map I mean if you could help
 

00:53:05.049 --> 00:53:08.190
dots on the map I mean if you could help
us I mean that's kind of part of for me

00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:08.200
us I mean that's kind of part of for me
 

00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:09.720
us I mean that's kind of part of for me
anyway what makes it all so overwhelming

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:09.730
anyway what makes it all so overwhelming
 

00:53:09.730 --> 00:53:12.240
anyway what makes it all so overwhelming
is just the idea that that there are all

00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:12.250
is just the idea that that there are all
 

00:53:12.250 --> 00:53:14.250

these other this was a medium-sized town

00:53:14.250 --> 00:53:14.260
these other this was a medium-sized town
 

00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:18.140
these other this was a medium-sized town
right and and so when you look at the

00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:18.150
right and and so when you look at the
 

00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:21.569
right and and so when you look at the
the larger context can you give us some

00:53:21.569 --> 00:53:21.579
the larger context can you give us some
 

00:53:21.579 --> 00:53:24.089
the larger context can you give us some
sense about what was unusual and and

00:53:24.089 --> 00:53:24.099
sense about what was unusual and and
 

00:53:24.099 --> 00:53:25.710
sense about what was unusual and and
what was typical about this especially

00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:25.720
what was typical about this especially
 

00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:28.589
what was typical about this especially
in terms of that I mean for me want one

00:53:28.589 --> 00:53:28.599
in terms of that I mean for me want one
 

00:53:28.599 --> 00:53:30.000
in terms of that I mean for me want one
of the things that so extraordinary is

of the things that so extraordinary is
 

00:53:30.010 --> 00:53:31.950
of the things that so extraordinary is
this longer history of violence right

00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:31.960
this longer history of violence right
 

00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:34.200
this longer history of violence right
that goes back many decades before the

00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:34.210
that goes back many decades before the
 

00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:37.490
that goes back many decades before the
Holocaust and so yeah so yeah

00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:37.500
Holocaust and so yeah so yeah
 

00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:41.220
Holocaust and so yeah so yeah
medium-sized it depends how you compare

00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:41.230
medium-sized it depends how you compare
 

00:53:41.230 --> 00:53:46.440
medium-sized it depends how you compare
what you compare it to but it had let's

00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:46.450
what you compare it to but it had let's
 

00:53:46.450 --> 00:53:48.599
what you compare it to but it had let's
say ten thousand eight thousand

00:53:48.599 --> 00:53:48.609
say ten thousand eight thousand
 

00:53:48.609 --> 00:53:50.880
say ten thousand eight thousand

the town today it's very similar to many

00:54:15.450 --> 00:54:15.460
the town today it's very similar to many

other towns in the region there are of

00:54:18.690 --> 00:54:18.700
other towns in the region there are of
 

00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:24.870
other towns in the region there are of
course differences some curious so one

00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:24.880
course differences some curious so one
 

00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:27.549
course differences some curious so one
difference is that this is

00:54:27.549 --> 00:54:27.559
difference is that this is
 

00:54:27.559 --> 00:54:29.979
difference is that this is
not a particularly hilly region but

00:54:29.979 --> 00:54:29.989
not a particularly hilly region but
 

00:54:29.989 --> 00:54:34.599
not a particularly hilly region but
buchiach' is built-in in this valley of

00:54:34.599 --> 00:54:34.609
buchiach' is built-in in this valley of
 

00:54:34.609 --> 00:54:37.209
buchiach' is built-in in this valley of
the stripper river so it has many hills

00:54:37.209 --> 00:54:37.219
the stripper river so it has many hills
 

00:54:37.219 --> 00:54:42.039
the stripper river so it has many hills
and that meant that when people had to

00:54:42.039 --> 00:54:42.049
and that meant that when people had to
 

00:54:42.049 --> 00:54:45.009
and that meant that when people had to
hide and they did it both say during the

00:54:45.009 --> 00:54:45.019
hide and they did it both say during the
 

00:54:45.019 --> 00:54:49.509

Turkish siege in the late 17th century
 

00:54:49.519 --> 00:54:52.059
Turkish siege in the late 17th century
and during the German occupation it was

00:54:52.059 --> 00:54:52.069
and during the German occupation it was
 

00:54:52.069 --> 00:54:53.769
and during the German occupation it was
easier to hide there because you could

00:54:53.769 --> 00:54:53.779
easier to hide there because you could
 

00:54:53.779 --> 00:54:56.859
easier to hide there because you could

dig from your house directly into the
mountain because the houses were built

00:54:58.779 --> 00:54:58.789
mountain because the houses were built
 

00:54:58.789 --> 00:55:01.679
mountain because the houses were built
on their own the slopes of the mountain

00:55:01.679 --> 00:55:01.689
on their own the slopes of the mountain
 

00:55:01.689 --> 00:55:03.579
on their own the slopes of the mountain
another thing that makes it different

00:55:03.579 --> 00:55:03.589
another thing that makes it different
 

00:55:03.589 --> 00:55:05.439
another thing that makes it different
from some other towns in the region is

00:55:05.439 --> 00:55:05.449
from some other towns in the region is
 

00:55:05.449 --> 00:55:07.539
from some other towns in the region is
that the next major town that I

them and there was competition between
them but by and large it's very similar

this criminal nature although it becomes
but has an ideological aspect to it and

00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:41.630
but has an ideological aspect to it and
 

00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:45.730
but has an ideological aspect to it and
that kicks in particularly as I argue in

00:56:45.730 --> 00:56:45.740
that kicks in particularly as I argue in
 

00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:47.860
that kicks in particularly as I argue in
World War one so it's from World War one

00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:47.870
World War one so it's from World War one
 

00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:53.080
World War one so it's from World War one
that the the things change dramatically

00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:53.090
that the the things change dramatically
 

00:56:53.090 --> 00:56:57.490
that the the things change dramatically
a butcher chain in many many other towns

00:56:57.490 --> 00:56:57.500
a butcher chain in many many other towns
 

00:56:57.500 --> 00:57:00.040
a butcher chain in many many other towns
in this region both because of the

00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:00.050
in this region both because of the
 

00:57:00.050 --> 00:57:02.440
in this region both because of the
violence of the war which is extremely

00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:02.450
violence of the war which is extremely
 

00:57:02.450 --> 00:57:04.960
violence of the war which is extremely
violent there and we know you know we

00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:04.970
violent there and we know you know we
 

00:57:04.970 --> 00:57:06.820
violent there and we know you know we
all read stories about the Western Front

00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:06.830
all read stories about the Western Front
 

00:57:06.830 --> 00:57:09.190
all read stories about the Western Front
that's what most people in the West read

00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:09.200
that's what most people in the West read
 

00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:10.930
that's what most people in the West read
but the war there was extremely funny

00:57:10.930 --> 00:57:10.940
but the war there was extremely funny
 

00:57:10.940 --> 00:57:13.990
but the war there was extremely funny
and because the war ends with the fall

00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:14.000
and because the war ends with the fall
 

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.150
and because the war ends with the fall
of the empires and the creation of

00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:16.160
of the empires and the creation of
 

00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:18.400
of the empires and the creation of
nation-states and these nation-states

00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:18.410
nation-states and these nation-states
 

00:57:18.410 --> 00:57:21.070
nation-states and these nation-states
see themselves as nation-states burdened

00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:21.080
see themselves as nation-states burdened
 

00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:23.710
see themselves as nation-states burdened
with these large minorities which they

00:57:23.710 --> 00:57:23.720
with these large minorities which they
 

00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:25.710
with these large minorities which they
want either to integrate or to kick out

00:57:25.710 --> 00:57:25.720
want either to integrate or to kick out
 

00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:29.680
want either to integrate or to kick out
okay I mean one thing it does seem I

00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:29.690
okay I mean one thing it does seem I
 

00:57:29.690 --> 00:57:32.950
okay I mean one thing it does seem I
mean it's not rare right but I mean

00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:32.960
mean it's not rare right but I mean
 

00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:35.530
mean it's not rare right but I mean
there was the the worst period was at

00:57:35.530 --> 00:57:35.540
there was the the worst period was at
 

00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:40.210
there was the the worst period was at
the very end when the Germans first are

00:57:40.210 --> 00:57:40.220
the very end when the Germans first are
 

00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:42.310
the very end when the Germans first are
driven back but then managed to not at

00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:42.320
driven back but then managed to not at
 

00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:44.320
driven back but then managed to not at
the very end but in 1944 they managed to

00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:44.330
the very end but in 1944 they managed to
 

00:57:44.330 --> 00:57:47.650
the very end but in 1944 they managed to
reoccupy this area is that something

00:57:47.650 --> 00:57:47.660
reoccupy this area is that something
 

00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:49.750
reoccupy this area is that something
where everywhere had happened was was

00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:49.760
where everywhere had happened was was
 

00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:52.240
where everywhere had happened was was
something that and then you know people

00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:52.250
something that and then you know people
 

00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:53.920
something that and then you know people
come out right they come out from hiding

00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:53.930
come out right they come out from hiding
 

00:57:53.930 --> 00:57:55.540
come out right they come out from hiding
yeah and then now they're they're

00:57:55.540 --> 00:57:55.550
yeah and then now they're they're
 

00:57:55.550 --> 00:57:56.080
yeah and then now they're they're
vulnerable

00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:56.090
vulnerable
 

00:57:56.090 --> 00:57:57.910
vulnerable
and almost all of them in this case

00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:57.920
and almost all of them in this case
 

00:57:57.920 --> 00:57:59.680
and almost all of them in this case
anyway are wiped out is that is that a

00:57:59.680 --> 00:57:59.690
anyway are wiped out is that is that a
 

00:57:59.690 --> 00:58:02.290
anyway are wiped out is that is that a
pattern that you've seen more broadly

00:58:02.290 --> 00:58:02.300
pattern that you've seen more broadly
 

00:58:02.300 --> 00:58:06.160
pattern that you've seen more broadly
well they this case is rather unique in

00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:06.170
well they this case is rather unique in
 

00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:10.000
well they this case is rather unique in
the sense that the Germans are pushed

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:10.010
the sense that the Germans are pushed
 

00:58:10.010 --> 00:58:13.540
the sense that the Germans are pushed
out and then because of the turn of

00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:13.550
out and then because of the turn of
 

00:58:13.550 --> 00:58:17.800
out and then because of the turn of
military events that they come back what

00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:17.810
military events that they come back what
 

00:58:17.810 --> 00:58:20.440
military events that they come back what
is interesting here is that when they

00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:20.450
is interesting here is that when they
 

00:58:20.450 --> 00:58:24.010
is interesting here is that when they
are pushed out 800 no one has the exact

00:58:24.010 --> 00:58:24.020
are pushed out 800 no one has the exact
 

00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:26.260
are pushed out 800 no one has the exact
figure so it's somewhere between 600 and

00:58:26.260 --> 00:58:26.270
figure so it's somewhere between 600 and
 

00:58:26.270 --> 00:58:28.930
figure so it's somewhere between 600 and
a thousand so let's say 800 Jews who

00:58:28.930 --> 00:58:28.940
a thousand so let's say 800 Jews who
 

00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:31.120
a thousand so let's say 800 Jews who
were residents of buchiach' come out of

00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:31.130
were residents of buchiach' come out of
 

00:58:31.130 --> 00:58:33.700
were residents of buchiach' come out of
hiding now compared to a thousand that's

00:58:33.700 --> 00:58:33.710
hiding now compared to a thousand that's
 

00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:39.190
hiding now compared to a thousand that's
not an so great but compared to survival

00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:39.200
not an so great but compared to survival
 

00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:42.100
not an so great but compared to survival
rate in general in this region it's

00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:42.110
rate in general in this region it's
 

00:58:42.110 --> 00:58:44.410
rate in general in this region it's
quite extraordinary that so many had

00:58:44.410 --> 00:58:44.420
quite extraordinary that so many had
 

00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:47.550
quite extraordinary that so many had
survived so the first question is why

00:58:47.550 --> 00:58:47.560
survived so the first question is why
 

00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:51.220
survived so the first question is why
did so many succeed in surviving a

00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:51.230
did so many succeed in surviving a
 

00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.980
did so many succeed in surviving a
butcher

00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:51.990
butcher
 

00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:55.280
butcher
like other towns what was the cause and

00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:55.290
like other towns what was the cause and
 

00:58:55.290 --> 00:58:57.130
like other towns what was the cause and
different people give different answers

00:58:57.130 --> 00:58:57.140
different people give different answers
 

00:58:57.140 --> 00:59:00.200
different people give different answers
so some people say well it's because

00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:00.210
so some people say well it's because
 

00:59:00.210 --> 00:59:02.660
so some people say well it's because
there was a Jewish resistance and the

00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:02.670
there was a Jewish resistance and the
 

00:59:02.670 --> 00:59:06.320
there was a Jewish resistance and the
Jewish resistance had intimidated polish

00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:06.330
Jewish resistance had intimidated polish
 

00:59:06.330 --> 00:59:09.520
Jewish resistance had intimidated polish
and particularly you Ukrainian denounces

00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:09.530
and particularly you Ukrainian denounces
 

00:59:09.530 --> 00:59:12.890
and particularly you Ukrainian denounces
Jew hunters who denouncing Jews for

00:59:12.890 --> 00:59:12.900
Jew hunters who denouncing Jews for
 

00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:15.050
Jew hunters who denouncing Jews for
money to the Germans and they had tried

00:59:15.050 --> 00:59:15.060
money to the Germans and they had tried
 

00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:17.210
money to the Germans and they had tried
to assassinate them they killed a couple

00:59:17.210 --> 00:59:17.220
to assassinate them they killed a couple
 

00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:21.140
to assassinate them they killed a couple
of them and so the denounces were

00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:21.150
of them and so the denounces were
 

00:59:21.150 --> 00:59:23.930
of them and so the denounces were
intimidated another argument is the

00:59:23.930 --> 00:59:23.940
intimidated another argument is the
 

00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:27.320
intimidated another argument is the
opposite that in in buchiach' relations

00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:27.330
opposite that in in buchiach' relations
 

00:59:27.330 --> 00:59:29.810
opposite that in in buchiach' relations
before the war were better than in many

00:59:29.810 --> 00:59:29.820
before the war were better than in many
 

00:59:29.820 --> 00:59:32.780
before the war were better than in many
other towns and it is a fact that when

00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:32.790
other towns and it is a fact that when
 

00:59:32.790 --> 00:59:36.859
other towns and it is a fact that when
the Germans arrived in early July 1941

00:59:36.859 --> 00:59:36.869
the Germans arrived in early July 1941
 

00:59:36.869 --> 00:59:39.980
the Germans arrived in early July 1941
there is no massive pogrom in buchiach'

00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:39.990
there is no massive pogrom in buchiach'
 

00:59:39.990 --> 00:59:42.230
there is no massive pogrom in buchiach'
and there is in many other towns it does

00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:42.240
and there is in many other towns it does
 

00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:44.630
and there is in many other towns it does
not happen in buchiach' and it's not

00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640
not happen in buchiach' and it's not
 

00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:46.160
not happen in buchiach' and it's not
that the Ukrainians don't take over they

00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:46.170
that the Ukrainians don't take over they
 

00:59:46.170 --> 00:59:48.290
that the Ukrainians don't take over they
do and there is violence but there's no

00:59:48.290 --> 00:59:48.300
do and there is violence but there's no
 

00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:50.450
do and there is violence but there's no
massive killing so that may be an

00:59:50.450 --> 00:59:50.460
massive killing so that may be an
 

00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:52.609
massive killing so that may be an
indication that in that town relations

00:59:52.609 --> 00:59:52.619
indication that in that town relations
 

00:59:52.619 --> 00:59:54.410
indication that in that town relations
were relatively better than in other

00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:54.420
were relatively better than in other
 

00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:57.890
were relatively better than in other
towns but but that is rather unique the

00:59:57.890 --> 00:59:57.900
towns but but that is rather unique the
 

00:59:57.900 --> 01:00:00.290
towns but but that is rather unique the
second aspect of it is of course that

01:00:00.290 --> 01:00:00.300
second aspect of it is of course that
 

01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:02.960
second aspect of it is of course that
then the Germans come back and when the

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:02.970
then the Germans come back and when the
 

01:00:02.970 --> 01:00:04.820
then the Germans come back and when the
Germans come back all the people came

01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:04.830
Germans come back all the people came
 

01:00:04.830 --> 01:00:05.840
Germans come back all the people came
out of hiding

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:05.850
out of hiding
 

01:00:05.850 --> 01:00:09.050
out of hiding
a the exhausted one has to understand

01:00:09.050 --> 01:00:09.060
a the exhausted one has to understand
 

01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:10.640
a the exhausted one has to understand
they were in hiding they're malnourished

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:10.650
they were in hiding they're malnourished
 

01:00:10.650 --> 01:00:13.010
they were in hiding they're malnourished
they'd usually been in the holes in the

01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:13.020
they'd usually been in the holes in the
 

01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:15.710
they'd usually been in the holes in the
ground they cannot walk they're very

01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:15.720
ground they cannot walk they're very
 

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:17.480
ground they cannot walk they're very
very weak so it's very hard for them to

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:17.490
very weak so it's very hard for them to
 

01:00:17.490 --> 01:00:20.990
very weak so it's very hard for them to
escape the Soviets were retreating tell

01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:21.000
escape the Soviets were retreating tell
 

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.460
escape the Soviets were retreating tell
them don't worry about it we'll be back

01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:22.470
them don't worry about it we'll be back
 

01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:24.680
them don't worry about it we'll be back
in in a day or two and of course they

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:24.690
in in a day or two and of course they
 

01:00:24.690 --> 01:00:28.090
in in a day or two and of course they
don't come back between April and July

01:00:28.090 --> 01:00:28.100
don't come back between April and July
 

01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:32.390
don't come back between April and July
so and thirdly their hiding places are

01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400
so and thirdly their hiding places are
 

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:36.349
so and thirdly their hiding places are
no no so it's very easy to hunt them

01:00:36.349 --> 01:00:36.359
no no so it's very easy to hunt them
 

01:00:36.359 --> 01:00:39.620
no no so it's very easy to hunt them
down and most of them are killed within

01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:39.630
down and most of them are killed within
 

01:00:39.630 --> 01:00:42.950
down and most of them are killed within
the next first few days after the German

01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:42.960
the next first few days after the German
 

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:47.630
the next first few days after the German
reoccupation so it gives you a whole

01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:47.640
reoccupation so it gives you a whole
 

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:52.430
reoccupation so it gives you a whole
variety of aspects that are relatively

more complicated it's just like we

01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:09.890
more complicated it's just like we

think it's there's a long way to go but

01:14:10.930 --> 01:14:10.940
think it's there's a long way to go but
 

01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:15.430
think it's there's a long way to go but
you know I I would say the same time I

01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:15.440
you know I I would say the same time I
 

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:20.740
you know I I would say the same time I
mean I know a number of young and not so

01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:20.750
mean I know a number of young and not so
 

01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:23.110
mean I know a number of young and not so
young Ukrainians who would like very

01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:23.120
young Ukrainians who would like very
 

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:26.500
young Ukrainians who would like very
much to change this and who are doing

01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:26.510
much to change this and who are doing
 

01:14:26.510 --> 01:14:29.290
much to change this and who are doing
their best it's very difficult to do now

01:14:29.290 --> 01:14:29.300
their best it's very difficult to do now
 

01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:31.209
their best it's very difficult to do now
there is an anti-semitic discourse in

01:14:31.209 --> 01:14:31.219
there is an anti-semitic discourse in
 

01:14:31.219 --> 01:14:33.310
there is an anti-semitic discourse in
Western Ukraine as there is also in

01:14:33.310 --> 01:14:33.320
Western Ukraine as there is also in
 

01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:36.490
Western Ukraine as there is also in
Lithuania it's very hard to do that but

01:14:36.490 --> 01:14:36.500
Lithuania it's very hard to do that but
 

01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:38.830
Lithuania it's very hard to do that but
I would just be careful about

01:14:38.830 --> 01:14:38.840
I would just be careful about
 

01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:40.919
I would just be careful about
generalizing because I think one has to

01:14:40.919 --> 01:14:40.929
generalizing because I think one has to
 

01:14:40.929 --> 01:14:43.689
generalizing because I think one has to
also work with a positive and there is a

01:14:43.689 --> 01:14:43.699
also work with a positive and there is a
 

01:14:43.699 --> 01:14:48.850
also work with a positive and there is a
positive there and there has been some

01:14:48.850 --> 01:14:48.860
positive there and there has been some
 

01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:52.990
positive there and there has been some
sort of tendency to dismiss Ukraine

01:14:52.990 --> 01:14:53.000
sort of tendency to dismiss Ukraine
 

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.820
sort of tendency to dismiss Ukraine
completely and I don't think it says

01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:54.830
completely and I don't think it says
 

01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:57.070
completely and I don't think it says
anyone's interest to just say well the

01:14:57.070 --> 01:14:57.080
anyone's interest to just say well the
 

01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:00.189
anyone's interest to just say well the
Ukrainians forget about it there is work

01:15:00.189 --> 01:15:00.199
Ukrainians forget about it there is work
 

01:15:00.199 --> 01:15:01.689
Ukrainians forget about it there is work
to be done there and I think it can be

01:15:01.689 --> 01:15:01.699
to be done there and I think it can be
 

01:15:01.699 --> 01:15:20.890
to be done there and I think it can be
done and should be encouraged and then

01:15:20.890 --> 01:15:20.900
done and should be encouraged and then
 

01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:23.709
done and should be encouraged and then
can you like give few examples in your

01:15:23.709 --> 01:15:23.719
can you like give few examples in your
 

01:15:23.719 --> 01:15:26.200
can you like give few examples in your
research that undermines this argument

01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:26.210
research that undermines this argument
 

01:15:26.210 --> 01:15:30.100
research that undermines this argument
the most prominent ones so you know when

the most prominent ones so you know when

the most prominent ones so you know when
I years ago when I started thinking

01:15:31.870 --> 01:15:31.880
I years ago when I started thinking
 

01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:33.610
I years ago when I started thinking
about this project this was the main

01:15:33.610 --> 01:15:33.620
about this project this was the main
 

01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:38.110
about this project this was the main
question that interested me because I I

01:15:38.110 --> 01:15:38.120
question that interested me because I I
 

01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:41.290
question that interested me because I I
went on a tour I visited some seminars

01:15:41.290 --> 01:15:41.300
went on a tour I visited some seminars
 

01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:44.890
went on a tour I visited some seminars
in Germany that were friends colleagues

01:15:44.890 --> 01:15:44.900
in Germany that were friends colleagues
 

01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:47.169
in Germany that were friends colleagues
were teaching courses on the Holocaust

01:15:47.169 --> 01:15:47.179
were teaching courses on the Holocaust
 

01:15:47.179 --> 01:15:49.689
were teaching courses on the Holocaust
and I was interested how is that done in

01:15:49.689 --> 01:15:49.699
and I was interested how is that done in
 

01:15:49.699 --> 01:15:58.450
and I was interested how is that done in
Germany this is 1517 years ago and the

01:15:58.450 --> 01:15:58.460
Germany this is 1517 years ago and the
 

01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:00.340
Germany this is 1517 years ago and the
courses were really interesting and the

01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:00.350
courses were really interesting and the
 

01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:01.900
courses were really interesting and the
students were very dedicated and they

01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:01.910
students were very dedicated and they
 

01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:04.689
students were very dedicated and they
read a lot and the read only material

01:16:04.689 --> 01:16:04.699
read a lot and the read only material
 

01:16:04.699 --> 01:16:05.950
read a lot and the read only material
about the perpetrators

01:16:05.950 --> 01:16:05.960
about the perpetrators
 

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:07.870
about the perpetrators
there is no memoirs they read nothing

01:16:07.870 --> 01:16:07.880
there is no memoirs they read nothing
 

01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:08.370
there is no memoirs they read nothing
about

01:16:08.370 --> 01:16:08.380
about
 

01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:10.680
about
they read only about Germans and when I

01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:10.690
they read only about Germans and when I
 

01:16:10.690 --> 01:16:12.390
they read only about Germans and when I
asked them why they said well because we

01:16:12.390 --> 01:16:12.400
asked them why they said well because we
 

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:15.750
asked them why they said well because we
need to know why we ancestors did that

01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:15.760
need to know why we ancestors did that
 

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:17.070
need to know why we ancestors did that
that's what we want to know I said yes

01:16:17.070 --> 01:16:17.080
that's what we want to know I said yes
 

01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:19.410
that's what we want to know I said yes
but genocide is a two-sided thing I mean

01:16:19.410 --> 01:16:19.420
but genocide is a two-sided thing I mean
 

01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:21.270
but genocide is a two-sided thing I mean
the the people kill and the people get

01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:21.280
the the people kill and the people get
 

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:24.090
the the people kill and the people get
killed and and what about them they said

01:16:24.090 --> 01:16:24.100
killed and and what about them they said
 

01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:26.459
killed and and what about them they said
well for them they didn't exist for the

01:16:26.459 --> 01:16:26.469
well for them they didn't exist for the
 

01:16:26.469 --> 01:16:27.959
well for them they didn't exist for the
killers the Jews didn't exist they

01:16:27.959 --> 01:16:27.969
killers the Jews didn't exist they
 

01:16:27.969 --> 01:16:30.780
killers the Jews didn't exist they
dehumanize them so and in a sense they

01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:30.790
dehumanize them so and in a sense they
 

01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:33.270
dehumanize them so and in a sense they
accepted that argument and I thought

01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:33.280
accepted that argument and I thought
 

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:36.450
accepted that argument and I thought
that once when you write about genocide

01:16:36.450 --> 01:16:36.460
that once when you write about genocide
 

01:16:36.460 --> 01:16:38.430
that once when you write about genocide
all about war for that matter about any

01:16:38.430 --> 01:16:38.440
all about war for that matter about any
 

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:40.890
all about war for that matter about any
violence and you write about it only for

01:16:40.890 --> 01:16:40.900
violence and you write about it only for
 

01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:43.640
violence and you write about it only for
one side you aren't you become complicit

01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:43.650
one side you aren't you become complicit
 

01:16:43.650 --> 01:16:46.280
one side you aren't you become complicit
because you see things only through that

01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:46.290
because you see things only through that
 

01:16:46.290 --> 01:16:50.250
because you see things only through that
perspective and I said eh I don't think

01:16:50.250 --> 01:16:50.260
perspective and I said eh I don't think
 

01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:52.979
perspective and I said eh I don't think
that's really good history and B I don't

01:16:52.979 --> 01:16:52.989
that's really good history and B I don't
 

01:16:52.989 --> 01:16:56.100
that's really good history and B I don't
believe it's true I don't think it it

01:16:56.100 --> 01:16:56.110
believe it's true I don't think it it
 

01:16:56.110 --> 01:16:58.290
believe it's true I don't think it it
did happen it can happen but it doesn't

01:16:58.290 --> 01:16:58.300
did happen it can happen but it doesn't
 

01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:00.479
did happen it can happen but it doesn't
consistently happen and it's not that

01:17:00.479 --> 01:17:00.489
consistently happen and it's not that
 

01:17:00.489 --> 01:17:03.689
consistently happen and it's not that
dehumanization is is the answer that you

01:17:03.689 --> 01:17:03.699
dehumanization is is the answer that you
 

01:17:03.699 --> 01:17:05.340
dehumanization is is the answer that you
dehumanize a group and then what's the

01:17:05.340 --> 01:17:05.350
dehumanize a group and then what's the
 

01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:07.350
dehumanize a group and then what's the
problem you just killed him because you

01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:07.360
problem you just killed him because you
 

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:09.209
problem you just killed him because you
still have to come to it to a child and

01:17:09.209 --> 01:17:09.219
still have to come to it to a child and
 

01:17:09.219 --> 01:17:11.189
still have to come to it to a child and
shoot them in the head and the brain

01:17:11.189 --> 01:17:11.199
shoot them in the head and the brain
 

01:17:11.199 --> 01:17:18.450
shoot them in the head and the brain
still spatter so this was the question

01:17:18.450 --> 01:17:18.460
still spatter so this was the question
 

01:17:18.460 --> 01:17:19.979
still spatter so this was the question
for me and it's a general question it's

01:17:19.979 --> 01:17:19.989
for me and it's a general question it's
 

01:17:19.989 --> 01:17:21.600
for me and it's a general question it's
a question about human psychology it's a

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:21.610
a question about human psychology it's a
 

01:17:21.610 --> 01:17:26.100
a question about human psychology it's a
question about violence in general and

01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:26.110
question about violence in general and
 

01:17:26.110 --> 01:17:28.470
question about violence in general and
it's a question about genocide and about

01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:28.480
it's a question about genocide and about
 

01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:30.540
it's a question about genocide and about
the Holocaust and it was particularly

01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:30.550
the Holocaust and it was particularly
 

01:17:30.550 --> 01:17:32.100
the Holocaust and it was particularly
prominent in speaking about the

01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:32.110
prominent in speaking about the
 

01:17:32.110 --> 01:17:34.430
prominent in speaking about the
Holocaust and especially in Germany for

01:17:34.430 --> 01:17:34.440
Holocaust and especially in Germany for
 

01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:36.780
Holocaust and especially in Germany for
reasons that we don't have to go into

01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:36.790
reasons that we don't have to go into
 

01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:43.649
reasons that we don't have to go into
further than what I said now my sense is

01:17:43.649 --> 01:17:43.659
further than what I said now my sense is
 

01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:50.810
further than what I said now my sense is
that when you look balanced more closely

01:17:50.810 --> 01:17:50.820
that when you look balanced more closely
 

01:17:50.820 --> 01:17:59.330
that when you look balanced more closely
you will often find other types of

01:17:59.330 --> 01:17:59.340
 
 

01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:01.979
 
interaction between the killer and the

01:18:01.979 --> 01:18:01.989
interaction between the killer and the
 

01:18:01.989 --> 01:18:06.479
interaction between the killer and the
killed and what I found when I started

01:18:06.479 --> 01:18:06.489
killed and what I found when I started
 

01:18:06.489 --> 01:18:08.220
killed and what I found when I started
doing this research I just wanted to see

01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:08.230
doing this research I just wanted to see
 

01:18:08.230 --> 01:18:09.689
doing this research I just wanted to see
what was the relationship between the

01:18:09.689 --> 01:18:09.699
what was the relationship between the
 

01:18:09.699 --> 01:18:12.240
what was the relationship between the
the killers and the killed right but

01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:12.250
the killers and the killed right but
 

01:18:12.250 --> 01:18:15.560
the killers and the killed right but
what I found was that intimacy an

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:15.570
what I found was that intimacy an
 

01:18:15.570 --> 01:18:19.459
what I found was that intimacy an
intimate relationship creates can create

01:18:19.459 --> 01:18:19.469
intimate relationship creates can create
 

01:18:19.469 --> 01:18:21.390
intimate relationship creates can create
proximity closeness

01:18:21.390 --> 01:18:21.400
proximity closeness
 

01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:24.840
proximity closeness
fashion and can create particularly

01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:24.850
fashion and can create particularly
 

01:18:24.850 --> 01:18:28.500
fashion and can create particularly
gruesome violence and I think that in

01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:28.510
gruesome violence and I think that in
 

01:18:28.510 --> 01:18:30.540
gruesome violence and I think that in
part I was influenced when I started

01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:30.550
part I was influenced when I started
 

01:18:30.550 --> 01:18:32.760
part I was influenced when I started
thinking about it also by events that

01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:32.770
thinking about it also by events that
 

01:18:32.770 --> 01:18:35.250
thinking about it also by events that
were happening at the time in Bosnia and

01:18:35.250 --> 01:18:35.260
were happening at the time in Bosnia and
 

01:18:35.260 --> 01:18:37.979
were happening at the time in Bosnia and
Rwanda where you see gratuitous violence

01:18:37.979 --> 01:18:37.989
Rwanda where you see gratuitous violence
 

01:18:37.989 --> 01:18:40.740
Rwanda where you see gratuitous violence
it's not just that you go and kill your

01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:40.750
it's not just that you go and kill your
 

01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:45.209
it's not just that you go and kill your
neighbors you rape them you you torture

01:18:45.209 --> 01:18:45.219
neighbors you rape them you you torture
 

01:18:45.219 --> 01:18:47.430
neighbors you rape them you you torture
them you kill the children in front of

01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:47.440
them you kill the children in front of
 

01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:49.979
them you kill the children in front of
the parents why why do you have to do

01:18:49.979 --> 01:18:49.989
the parents why why do you have to do
 

01:18:49.989 --> 01:18:53.700
the parents why why do you have to do
those things that's that's often part of

01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:53.710
those things that's that's often part of
 

01:18:53.710 --> 01:18:57.240
those things that's that's often part of
genocide by wine and that has to do and

01:18:57.240 --> 01:18:57.250
genocide by wine and that has to do and
 

01:18:57.250 --> 01:18:59.610
genocide by wine and that has to do and
I started thinking about it precisely

01:18:59.610 --> 01:18:59.620
I started thinking about it precisely
 

01:18:59.620 --> 01:19:02.790
I started thinking about it precisely
with the fact that you know them so it's

01:19:02.790 --> 01:19:02.800
with the fact that you know them so it's
 

01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:05.640
with the fact that you know them so it's
not just that it's easier to kill when

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:05.650
not just that it's easier to kill when
 

01:19:05.650 --> 01:19:08.430
not just that it's easier to kill when
you dehumanize it's when you know people

01:19:08.430 --> 01:19:08.440
you dehumanize it's when you know people
 

01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:10.620
you dehumanize it's when you know people
the nature of the killing is different

01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:10.630
the nature of the killing is different
 

01:19:10.630 --> 01:19:14.700
the nature of the killing is different
and it's and that you can see again and

01:19:14.700 --> 01:19:14.710
and it's and that you can see again and
 

01:19:14.710 --> 01:19:16.979
and it's and that you can see again and
again in many genocides now in the

01:19:16.979 --> 01:19:16.989
again in many genocides now in the
 

01:19:16.989 --> 01:19:20.459
again in many genocides now in the
Holocaust we I I actually used that term

01:19:20.459 --> 01:19:20.469
Holocaust we I I actually used that term
 

01:19:20.469 --> 01:19:22.890
Holocaust we I I actually used that term
in in a book I wrote industrial killing

01:19:22.890 --> 01:19:22.900
in in a book I wrote industrial killing
 

01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:25.860
in in a book I wrote industrial killing
so we we tend to talk about industrial

01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:25.870
so we we tend to talk about industrial
 

01:19:25.870 --> 01:19:28.020
so we we tend to talk about industrial
killing and it is a unique aspect of the

01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:28.030
killing and it is a unique aspect of the
 

01:19:28.030 --> 01:19:30.149
killing and it is a unique aspect of the
Holocaust in terms if you compare to

01:19:30.149 --> 01:19:30.159
Holocaust in terms if you compare to
 

01:19:30.159 --> 01:19:32.459
Holocaust in terms if you compare to
other genocides but as I said much of it

01:19:32.459 --> 01:19:32.469
other genocides but as I said much of it
 

01:19:32.469 --> 01:19:35.310
other genocides but as I said much of it
didn't happen that way much of it

01:19:35.310 --> 01:19:35.320
didn't happen that way much of it
 

01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:40.110
didn't happen that way much of it
happened very intimately and so if you

01:19:40.110 --> 01:19:40.120
happened very intimately and so if you
 

01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:44.189
happened very intimately and so if you
want examples of that for me the most

01:19:44.189 --> 01:19:44.199
want examples of that for me the most
 

01:19:44.199 --> 01:19:47.490
want examples of that for me the most
striking examples are of people and and

01:19:47.490 --> 01:19:47.500
striking examples are of people and and
 

01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:49.410
striking examples are of people and and
