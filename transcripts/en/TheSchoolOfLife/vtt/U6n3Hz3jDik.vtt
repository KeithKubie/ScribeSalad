00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.620
It may not seem like it, but teasing done
with affection and skill is a profound human

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.269
accomplishment. There’s nasty teasing, of
course – in which we pick away at a sore

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.890
spot in someone’s life. But here we’re talking
of the affectionate version, something

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.900
generous and loving – which feels good to
be on the receiving end of.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.850
It may be lovely to be teased when, for example,
you’re a teenager and in a grumpy, sullen

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:34.600
mood, and your kindly dad nicknames you Hamlet,
Shakespeare’s Danish prince of gloom. Or

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.719
when you’re 45 and pretty serious in business
and your old university friends come around

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.920
and call you by that name they made up for
you aged 19, the night you failed dismally

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.530
trying to pick up a German girl who was in
town.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.839
All of us get a bit unbalanced in one way
or another: too serious, too gloomy, too jokey.

00:00:54.839 --> 00:01:01.140
And so we all benefit from being tugged back
towards a healthier mean. The good-teaser

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.120
latches onto and responds to our distinctive
imbalances and gets compassionately constructive

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.640
about trying to change us: not by delivering
a stern lesson, but by helping us to notice

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.110
our excesses and laugh at them. We sense the
teaser trying to give us a useful little shove

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.380
in a good (and secretly welcome) direction
and therefore know that, at its affectionate

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:31.990
best, teasing is at once sweet and constructive.
The English literary critic Cyril Connolly

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:38.670
once famously said: Imprisoned in every fat
man a thin man is wildly signalling to be

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.640
let out.
It’s a general idea with multiple variants:

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.060
inside the fussy, over formal individual there’s
a more relaxed person looking for an opening;

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.170
there’s an ambitious, eager self quietly
despairing within the lazy man; the gloomy,

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.820
disenchanted cynic harbours a more cheery,
sunny sub-self in need of more recognition.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.420
The teasing remark speaks over the head of ones dominant personality to the subordinated side

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.049
of the self, whom it helps to release and
relax. There’s a moment in The Line of Beauty

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:18.379
– a novel by Alan Hollinghurst, set in the
1980s – in which Nick, the charming young

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:23.519
central character, is invited to a grand party
and meets the British Prime minister, Margaret

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:30.790
Thatcher. Everyone is slightly terrified of
her, but Nick warmly and teasingly suggests

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.150
she might like to dance to a pop song. The
other guests are horrified – she’s meant

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.139
to be obsessed by stringent economic reform
and hard-nosed politics – but after a brief

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:46.160
inner struggle, she replies with a smile:
‘You know, I’d like that very much.’

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.569
(Perhaps if, in reality, there had been more
people to tease her, the pop-loving, dancing

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.769
side of Mrs Thatcher might have played a greater
role in national affairs – and history would

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.040
have been different).
When we enjoy being warmly teased, it’s

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.689
because the teasing remark emerges from a
genuine insight into who we are. This person

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:11.510
has studied us and put their finger on a struggle
that’s going on in us; they’ve taken the

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.230
part of a nice – but currently under-supported
– side of who we are. It’s pleasing because

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.780
normally others don’t see much past the
front we put on for the world. Typically,

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.810
the world just thinks we are gloomy, or stern,
or intellectual, or obsessed by fashion. The

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.489
teaser does us the favour of recognising that
the dominant front isn’t telling the whole

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:39.460
story; they’re kind enough and perceptive
enough to see past the surface. Perhaps the

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.810
most instructive question we can ask – the
one that teaches us most about the value of

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:51.239
affectionate teasing – is simply: what do
I need to be teased about? .
