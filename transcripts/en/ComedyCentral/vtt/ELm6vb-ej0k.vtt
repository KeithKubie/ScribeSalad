00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.973
AND HE HAS
THE BEST BURGER IN TOWN.

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:07.941 line:0%
 
- I HAVE THE BEST BURGERS
IN L.A.

00:00:07.975 --> 00:00:09.243
- SO I PAID HIM A VISIT
WITH A WAY

00:00:09.276 --> 00:00:11.478
TO GET EVERYONE
TO TRY HIS BURGER.

00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:14.548
MY PLAN WAS A GUARANTEE:
TRY THE BURGER,

00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:16.550
AND IF YOU DON'T THINK
IT'S THE BEST IN L.A.,

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:20.020
GUSTAVO WILL GIVE YOU
$100 CASH OF HIS OWN MONEY.

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:22.789
- I DON'T KNOW.

00:00:22.823 --> 00:00:24.291
- IT IS THE BEST, RIGHT?
- IT'S THE BEST.

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:27.628
- OKAY, GREAT.
SO THEN WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:29.563
- WELL,
I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE--

00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:31.798
- UNLESS YOUR BURGER
ISN'T THE BEST.

00:00:31.832 --> 00:00:35.135
- UH, WELL, UM--

00:00:35.169 --> 00:00:36.303
- WAIT,
IS YOUR BURGER THE BEST?

00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:38.105
- OF COURSE,
IT'S THE BEST.

00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:41.341
- 'CAUSE NO BURGER PLACE
HAS EVER MADE A CLAIM LIKE THIS,

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:46.113
BUT YOU CAN,
'CAUSE YOU'RE THE BEST.

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:48.081
- WELL,
IT SOUNDS GOOD.

00:00:48.115 --> 00:00:50.217
- YEAH
- IT SOUNDS GOOD.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.387
- GUSTAVO AGREED TO PUT UP
HIS OWN CASH FOR THE PROMOTION,

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.855
AND IT WAS
SUCH AN AMAZING OFFER,

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:56.690
THAT I WAS EASILY ABLE
TO LAND US

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:59.393
ON L.A.'S MOST LISTENED-TO
MORNING RADIO SHOW.

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:01.562
- [radio announcer]
95.5 KLOS.

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:04.064
- COME OVER,
TRY OUR--OUR BURGERS.

00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:07.301
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT,
IT'S GONNA BE $100 BILL.

00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:08.769
- WOW, THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.
- THAT'S--

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:09.870
THAT'S A LOT OF BALLS,
GUSTAVO...

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:11.572
- YEAH.
- 100 BUCKS, 'CAUSE I MEAN,

00:01:11.605 --> 00:01:13.307
AREN'T YOU--I MEAN,
WHEN'S THIS PROMOTION HAPPENING?

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.542
- IT'S GONNA HAPPEN TODAY AT--
- TODAY?

00:01:15.576 --> 00:01:17.110
- YEAH.
- I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR

00:01:17.144 --> 00:01:18.111
HOW IT TURNS OUT. OKAY.
- ALL FAITH, ALL RIGHT.

00:01:18.145 --> 00:01:19.379
- AND I TRUST HIM,

00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:20.547
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY
TRIED THE BURGER.

00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:21.915
I DON'T EAT RED MEAT
RIGHT NOW.

00:01:21.949 --> 00:01:23.317
- WHAT?
- WHAT?

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.551
- SO I MEAN,
WHEN HE SAYS IT'S THE BEST,

00:01:24.585 --> 00:01:27.087
I--YOU KNOW,
I BELIEVE THAT IT'S THE BEST.

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:28.555
- OKAY.
- CAN I ASK,

00:01:28.589 --> 00:01:30.858
HOW MANY PEOPLE
ARE LISTENING RIGHT NOW?

00:01:30.891 --> 00:01:32.259
both: MILLIONS.
- MILLIONS?

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:33.260
- YEAH.
- MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:34.461
ARE LISTENING TO THIS RIGHT NOW,
GUSTAVO.

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:37.865
- THAT'S CRAZY.
- YEAH, THAT IS.

00:01:37.898 --> 00:01:40.300
- LET'S GO TO FREDDY
ON LINE TWO.

00:01:40.334 --> 00:01:42.803
HELLO, FREDDY. WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THIS PROMOTIONAL IDEA

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:44.171
THAT L.A. BURGER'S
THROWING ON.

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:46.607
- I THINK
IT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.709
LET ME TELL YOU MY BACKGROUND,
FIRST OF ALL--

00:01:48.742 --> 00:01:51.144
- WELL, I--WHO CARES
ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND, FREDDY?

00:01:51.178 --> 00:01:54.114
[laughter]
ALL RIGHT, NEXT CALLER, PLEASE.

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:55.983
- STEVE ON LINE TWO.
HELLO, STEVE.

00:01:56.016 --> 00:01:57.651
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THIS IDEA?

00:01:57.684 --> 00:02:01.688
- WELL, I ADMIRE, YOU KNOW,
HIM STANDING BY HIS PRODUCT,

00:02:01.722 --> 00:02:04.725
BUT I THINK
THAT SOMEBODY CAN BE DISHONEST

00:02:04.758 --> 00:02:08.495
AND LIE ABOUT THE BURGER.
THEY CAN JUST SAY, "YOU KNOW,

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:10.597
I'VE HAD OTHER BURGERS
I THINK ARE BETTER."

00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:12.599
- I COULD SEE THAT GUSTAVO
WAS GETTING NERVOUS

00:02:12.633 --> 00:02:14.067
DURING THE RADIO SHOW,

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:15.769
SO AFTER,
I HAD A TALK WITH HIM.

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:18.705
- SO I SAW YOU WERE
A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS IN THERE.

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.309
- UM, A LITTLE.
[chuckles]

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:25.345
- WELL, I DON'T WANT THIS TO BE
A STRESSFUL EXPERIENCE FOR YOU,

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.348
SO I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
EVEN THOUGH IT'S UNLIKELY

00:02:28.382 --> 00:02:31.585
I THINK PEOPLE
WILL CLAIM THE $100,

00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:34.755
I'LL PERSONALLY PUT UP
MY OWN MONEY IF THEY DO,

00:02:34.788 --> 00:02:36.990
BUT IT'S ONLY BECAUSE
I TRUST YOU

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.893
WHEN YOU SAY IT'S THE BEST.
IT IS THE BEST, RIGHT?

00:02:39.927 --> 00:02:41.361
- IT IS THE BEST, YES.

00:02:41.395 --> 00:02:42.696
- SO WE WON'T
BE PAYING A LOT.

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:45.732
- WE'RE NOT GONNA PAY
THAT MUCH MONEY...AT ALL.

00:02:45.766 --> 00:02:48.602
- OKAY, SO NO RISK ON YOU,
IT'S ALL ON ME.

00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:50.270
both: [laugh]
