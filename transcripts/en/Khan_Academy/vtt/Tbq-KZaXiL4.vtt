00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.040
I think we have a decent idea of
how a signal is transmitted

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.620
along the neuron.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.800
We saw that a couple of
dendrites, maybe that one and

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.000
that one and that one, might
get excited or triggered.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.960
And when we say it gets
triggered, we're saying that

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.800
some type of channel
gets opened.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.290
That's probably the trigger.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.790
That channel allows ions to be
released into the cell-- or

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.120
actually, there are situations
where ions can be released out

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.550
of the cell.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.700
It would be inhibitory, but
let's take the case where ions

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.820
are released into the cells in
an electrotonic fashion.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.510
It changes the charge or the
voltage gradient across the

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.750
membrane and if the combined
effects of the change in the

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.280
voltage gradient is just enough
at the axon hillock to

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.790
meet that threshold, then the
sodium channels over here will

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.030
open up, sodium floods in, and
then we have the situation

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.160
where the voltage becomes
very positive.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.090
Potassium channels open up to
change things again, but by

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.710
the time we went very
positive, then that

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.320
eletrotonically affects
the next sodium pump.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.730
But then we have the situation
where that will allow sodium

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.360
ions to flood in and then
the signal keeps getting

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.550
transmitted.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.240
Now the next natural question
is, what happens at the neuron

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.590
to neuron junctions?

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.640
We said that this dendrite gets

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.550
triggered or gets excited.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.050
In most cases, it's getting
triggered or excited by

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.810
another neuron.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.340
It could be something else.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.550
And over here, when this axon
fires, it should be exciting

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.520
either another cell.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.760
It could be a muscle cell or--
in probably most cases of the

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.820
human body-- it's exciting
another neuron.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.050
And so how does it do that?

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.140
So this is the terminal
end of the axon.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.535
There could be the dendrite of
another neuron right here.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.430
This is another neuron with its
own axon, its own cell.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.400
This would trigger the
dendrite right there.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.190
So the question is, how
does that happen?

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.130
How does the signal go from one
neuron's axon to the next

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.990
neuron's dendrite?

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.770
It actually always doesn't
have to go from axon to

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.449
dendrite, but that's
the most typical.

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.460
You can actually go from axon to
axon, dendrite to dendrite,

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.040
axon to soma-- but let's just
focus on axon to dendrite

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.340
because that's the most
traditional way that neurons

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.180
transmit information from
one to the other.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.990
So let's zoom in.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.700
Let's zoom in right here.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.610
This little box right there,
let's zoom at the base, the

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.740
terminal end of this axon
and let's zoom in

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.020
on this whole area.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.010
Then we'll also zoom in-- we're
also going to get the

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.370
dendrite of this next neuron--
and I'm going to rotate it.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.320
Actually, I don't even
have to rotate it.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.950
So to do that, let me draw
the terminal end.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.090
So let's say the terminal end
looks something like this.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.215
I'm zoomed in big time.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.090
This is the terminal
end of the neuron.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.160
This is inside the neuron and
then the next dendrite-- let

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.485
me draw it right here.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.800
So we've really zoomed in.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:17.100
So this is the dendrite
of the next neuron.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.710
This is inside the
first neuron.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.080
So we have this action
potential that

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.640
keeps traveling along.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.580
Eventually for maybe right over
here-- I don't know if

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.970
you can zoom in-- which would
be over here, the action

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.680
potential makes the electrical
potential or the voltage

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.480
potential across this membrane
just positive enough to

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.410
trigger this sodium channel.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.610
So actually, maybe
I'm really close.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.750
This channel is this
one right here.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.340
So then it allows a flood of
sodium to enter the cell.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.560
And then the the whole
thing happens.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.780
You have potassium that can then
take it out, but by the

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.340
time this comes in, this
positive charge, it can

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.930
trigger another channel and it
could trigger another sodium

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.240
channel if there's other sodium
channels further down,

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.750
but near the end of
the axon there are

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.470
actually calcium channels.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.200
I'll do that in pink.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:23.680
So this is a calcium channel
that is traditionally closed.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.960
So this is a calcium
ion channel.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.545
Calcium has a plus 2 charge.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.230
It tends to be closed, but
it's also voltage gated.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.960
When the voltage gets high
enough, it's very similar to a

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.670
sodium voltage gated channel is
that if it becomes positive

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.640
enough near the gate, it will
open up and when it opens up,

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.400
it allows calcium ions to
flood into the cell.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.450
So the calcium ions, their
plus 2 charge, to

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.180
flood into the cells.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.270
Now you're saying, hey Sal, why
are calcium ions flooding

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.980
into the cells?

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.660
These have positive charge.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.530
I just thought you said that the
cell is becoming positive

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.130
because of all the sodium
flowing in.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.300
Why would this calcium
want to flow in?

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.890
And the reason why it wants to
flow in is because the cell

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.940
also-- just like it pumps out
sodium and pumps in potassium,

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.990
the cell also has calcium ion
pumps and the mechanism is

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.120
nearly identical to what I
showed you on the sodium

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.090
potassium pump, but it just
deals with calcium.

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.550
So you literally have these
proteins that are sitting

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:31.820
across the membrane.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.720
This is a phospobilipid
layer membrane.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.560
Maybe I'll draw two layers here
just so you realize it's

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.470
a bi-layer membrane.

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:42.525
Let me draw it like that.

00:05:42.525 --> 00:05:47.020
That makes it look a little bit
more realistic, although

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.670
the whole thing is not
very realistic.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.776
And this is also going to
be a bilipid membrane.

00:05:52.776 --> 00:05:56.660
You get the idea, but
let me just do it to

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.400
make the point clear.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.620
So there are also these calcium
ion pumps that are

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.100
also subsets of ATPases, which
they're just like the sodium

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.180
potassium pumps.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:13.720
You give them one ATP and a
calcium will bond someplace

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:20.240
else and it'll pull apart the
phosphate from the ATP and

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.950
that'll be enough energy to
change the confirmation of

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.720
this protein and it'll
push the calcium out.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.040
Essentially, what was the
calcium will bond and then

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.500
it'll open up so the calcium
can only exit the cell.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.350
It's just like the sodium
potassium pumps, but it's good

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.880
to know in the resting state,
you have a high concentration

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.200
of calcium ions out here and
it's all driven by ATP.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.170
A much higher concentration on
the outside than you have on

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.870
the inside and it's driven
by those ion pumps.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.980
So once you have this action
potential, instead of

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:54.360
triggering another sodium gate,
it starts triggering

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.630
calcium gates and these calcium
ions flood into the

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:01.190
terminal end of this axon.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:05.810
Now, these calcium ions, they
bond to other proteins.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.980
And before I go to those other
proteins, we have to keep in

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:12.230
mind what's going on near this
junction right here.

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.840
And I've used the word
synapse already--

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.100
actually, maybe I haven't.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:21.240
The place where this axon is
meeting with this dendrite,

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.490
this is the synapse.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.680
Or you can kind of view it as
the touching point or the

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.020
communication point or
the connection point.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.480
And this neuron right
here, this is called

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.920
the presynaptic neuron.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:40.730
Let me write that down.

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.660
It's good to have a little
terminology under our belt.

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.250
This is the post-synaptic
neuron.

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:02.740
And the space between the two
neurons, between this axon and

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.680
this dendrite, this is called
the synaptic cleft.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:15.700
It's a really small space in the
terms of-- so what we're

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.900
going to deal with in this video
is a chemical synapse.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.450
In general, when people talk
about synapses, they're

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:23.260
talking about chemical
synapses.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.880
There also are electrical
synapses, but I won't go into

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:26.810
detail on those.

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:29.470
This is kind of the most
traditional one that people

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:30.650
talk about.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:34.669
So your synaptic cleft in
chemical synapses is about 20

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:38.460
nanometers, which
is really small.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:45.620
If you think about the average
width of a cell as about 10 to

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:49.150
100 microns-- this micron
is 10 to the minus 6.

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.160
This is 20 times 10 to
the minus 9 meters.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.290
So this is a very small distance
and it makes sense

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:56.950
because look how big
the cells look next

00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:58.040
to this small distance.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:02.210
So it's a very small distance
and you have-- on the

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:05.370
presynaptic neuron near
the terminal end,

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:06.750
you have these vesicles.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:07.770
Remember what vesicles were.

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:13.920
These are just membrane bound
things inside of the cell.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.120
So you have these vesicles.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:20.760
They also have their
phospobilipid layers, their

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.360
little membranes.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.590
So you have these vesicles so
these are just-- you can kind

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:25.350
of view them as containers.

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:31.020
I'll just draw one more
just like that.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:34.060
And they can train these
molecules called

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:36.520
neurotransmitters and
I'll draw the

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:41.280
neurotransmitters in green.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.790
So they have these
molecules called

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:45.140
neurotransmitters in them.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:48.410
You've probably heard
the word before.

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:53.050
In fact, a lot of drugs that
people use for depression or

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:59.380
other things related to our
mental state, they affect

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.100
neurotransmitters.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.720
I won't go into detail there,
but they contain these

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.710
neurotransmitters.

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:08.810
And when the calcium channels--
they're voltage

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:11.360
gated-- when it becomes a little
more positive, they

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.310
open calcium floods in and what
the calcium does is, it

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:19.820
bonds to these proteins that
have docked these vesciles.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:26.170
So these little vesicles,
they're docked to the

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:30.430
presynpatic membrane or to this
axon terminal membrane

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:30.820
right there.

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:33.520
These proteins are actually
called SNARE proteins.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.290
It's an acronym, but it's also
a good word because they've

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:39.540
literally snared the vesicles
to this membrane.

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.470
So that's what these
proteins are.

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:45.810
And when these calcium ions
flood in, they bond to these

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:50.970
proteins, they attach to these
proteins, and they change the

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:53.850
confirmation of the proteins
just enough that these

00:10:53.850 --> 00:11:00.610
proteins bring these vesicles
closer to the membrane and

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:03.090
also kind of pull apart the
two membranes so that the

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:04.040
membranes merge.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:07.180
Let me do a zoom in of that
just to make it clear

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:08.370
what's going on.

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:11.700
So after they've bonded-- this
is kind of before the calcium

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:16.070
comes in, bonds to those SNARE
proteins, then the SNARE

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:20.190
protein will bring the vesicle
ultra-close to

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:22.580
the presynaptic membrane.

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:25.710
So that's the vesicle and then
the presynaptic membrane will

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:32.370
look like this and then you
have your SNARE proteins.

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:34.560
And I'm not obviously drawing it
exactly how it looks in the

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.210
cell, but it'll give you the
idea of what's going on.

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:42.000
Your SNARE proteins have
essentially pulled the things

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.510
together and have pulled them
apart so that these two

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:45.780
membranes merge.

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.050
And then the main side effect--
the reason why all

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:51.350
this is happening-- is it allows
those neurotransmitters

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:54.070
to be dumped into the
synaptic cleft.

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.980
So those neurotransmitters
that were inside of our

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:01.360
vesicle then get dumped into
the synaptic cleft.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.630
This process right here
is called exocytosis.

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:12.170
It's exiting the cytoplasm,
you could say, of the

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:14.210
presynaptic neuron.

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:17.130
These neurotransmitters-- and
you've probably heard the

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:20.560
specific names of many of
these-- serotonin, dopamine,

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.770
epinephrine-- which is also
adrenaline, but that's also a

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:26.130
hormone, but it also acts
as a neurotransmitter.

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:29.380
Norepinephrine, also both
a hormone and a

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:29.830
neurotransmitter.

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:32.820
So these are words that you've
probably heard before.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:36.070
But anyway, these enter into
the synaptic cleft and then

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:43.780
they bond on the surface
of the membrane of the

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.100
post-synaptic neuron
or this dendrite.

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:53.890
Let's say they bond here, they
bond here, and they bond here.

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:56.560
So they bond on special proteins
on this membrane

00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:02.000
surface, but the main effect of
that is, that will trigger

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.200
ion channels.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:07.880
So let's say that this neuron
is exciting this dendrite.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:11.540
So when these neurotransmitters
bond on this

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:14.780
membrane, maybe sodium
channels open up.

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:18.650
So maybe that will cause a
sodium channel to open up.

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:20.240
So instead of being voltage
gated, it's

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.050
neurotransmitter gated.

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:24.950
So this will cause a sodium
channel to open up and then

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:29.350
sodium will flow in and then,
just like we said before, if

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:31.970
we go to the original one,
that's like this getting

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:34.680
excited, it'll become a little
bit positive and then if it's

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:38.870
enough positive, it'll
electrotonically increase the

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.250
potential at this point on the
axon hillock and then we'll

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:45.600
have another neuron-- in this
case, this neuron being

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.370
stimulated.

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:48.070
So that's essentially
how it happens.

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:49.160
It actually could
be inhibitory.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:54.860
You could imagine if this,
instead of triggering a sodium

00:13:54.860 --> 00:14:00.340
ion channel, if it triggered
a potassium ion channel.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:04.450
If it triggered a potassium ion
channel, potassium ion's

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:06.400
concentration gradient will
make it want to go

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.900
outside of the cell.

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.740
So positive things are
going to leave the

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:11.870
cell if it's potassium.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:14.430
Remember, I used triangles
for potassium.

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:18.430
And so if positive things leave
the cell, then if you go

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:21.550
further down the neuron, it'll
become less positive and so

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:25.520
it'll be even harder for the
action potential to start up

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.050
because it'll need even more
positive someplace else to

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:30.370
make the threshold gradient.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.300
I hope I'm not confusing
you when I say that.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.960
So this connection,
the way I first

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.240
described it, it's exciting.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.140
When this guy gets excited
from an action potential,

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:39.620
calcium floods in.

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:43.680
It makes these vesicles dump
their contents in the synaptic

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:49.680
cleft and then that will make
other sodium gates open up and

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.930
then that will stimulate this
neuron, but if it makes

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:55.050
potassium gates open up, then
it will inhibit it-- and

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:59.520
that's how, frankly, these
synapses work.

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.600
I was about to say there's
millions of synapses, but

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.480
that'd be incorrect.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.840
There's trillions of synapses.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.870
The best estimate of the number
of synapses in our

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:18.990
cerebral cortex is 100 to 500
trillion synapses just in the

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:19.860
cerebral cortex.

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:22.450
The reason why we can have so
many is that one neuron can

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:25.840
actually form many, many,
many, many synapses.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.740
I mean, you can imagine if this
original drawing of a

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.760
cell, you might have a synapse
here, a synapse here, a

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:30.600
synapse there.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:33.680
You could have hundreds or
thousands of synapses even,

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.120
into one neuron or going
out of one neuron.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.240
This might be a synapse with
one neuron, another one,

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.250
another one, another one.

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:42.260
So you'd have many, many, many,
many, many connections.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:47.220
And so synapses are really what
give us the complexity of

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:50.400
what probably make us tick in
terms of our human mind and

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:50.980
all of that.

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:53.390
But anyway, hopefully you
found this useful.
