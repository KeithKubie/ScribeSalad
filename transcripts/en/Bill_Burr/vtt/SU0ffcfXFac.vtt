00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.070
Hey,
what's going on i's Bill Burr.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:09.420
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.
And I am checking in on you.

3
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.700
Um,
you know I do this show.
I usually,
you know how I do,
I usually uh,

4
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.030
talk here to myself.
I usually babble.

5
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.150
I usually ramble and then I try to read out loud,

6
00:00:21.151 --> 00:00:26.151
but every once in awhile I have a special guest and a,

7
00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:30.780
this is one of these Thursdays.
Um,
this man is here to promote his new book.

8
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.890
Everybody is awful except for you.
That will be uh,

9
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.640
you can preorder now and it's going to be available on Amazon,

10
00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:43.380
Barnes and nobles and all that stuff.
Please welcome Jim Florentine.
Everybody.

11
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.960
It's good to see a bell and thanks for having me back man.

12
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.080
He liked how I did the big buildup.
I said the book,
I did the whole thing.

13
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.860
I was waiting for everybody to sit back and try and guess who the hell it was

14
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.650
going to be,
you know,
and then,
then I,
then I dropped the name on it.

15
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.460
That's old school showbiz right there.
That is cause then like who could it be?

16
00:00:59.461 --> 00:01:01.800
Maybe it's,
you know,
someone hasn't talked in a while.

17
00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:05.700
Maybe he's getting a Louis CK exclusive.
Maybe Louise coming back.
Yeah.

18
00:01:05.701 --> 00:01:08.700
Maybe he's coming back and he's going to do what I'm bill's podcasts and you

19
00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:11.370
know,
we were just talking about,
they might as well dive in.

20
00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:15.330
That whole me too thing.
It's just like obviously had to happen everything,

21
00:01:15.331 --> 00:01:18.960
but it is such like a bullying environment.
Even like the bullshit,

22
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.820
if it's a bullshit one,
you can't say anything.
Like recently one came out,

23
00:01:23.821 --> 00:01:24.690
it was just like,
all right,

24
00:01:24.691 --> 00:01:28.590
this just seemed like this woman wanted a famous boyfriend and it didn't happen

25
00:01:28.591 --> 00:01:32.460
and then the end she went on her friend's blog or some shit and trash to this

26
00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:36.900
guy,
and I can't even name names before all these fucking lunatic start coming at

27
00:01:36.901 --> 00:01:41.130
like there's no,
there's no like,
hey,
hey,
hey,
let's,
let's,

28
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.360
let's examine this.

29
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.140
It's just all this person said that that means that's how it happened.

30
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.700
That's how the whole thing went down and let's burn down this person's life and

31
00:01:50.701 --> 00:01:55.260
their entire bill ability to earn a living.
It's a little nuts.
Absolutely.

32
00:01:55.261 --> 00:01:58.530
And being me being a single guy out there,
absolutely.
You don't know.

33
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.650
This is what you do like sign in triplicate before you'd be like,
I'm trying to,

34
00:02:02.651 --> 00:02:04.570
I'm trying to get like,
you know,
shacks contract.

35
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.380
He used to sign or Michael Jordan or whatever supposedly had a thing where they

36
00:02:07.381 --> 00:02:10.860
would sign like they're Osisko okay,
you go into the hotel room next door,

37
00:02:10.861 --> 00:02:14.160
you know what's going to happen?
Sign here.
Yes.
This self,

38
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.870
this is so here's the consent.

39
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.360
You're a good center water and then you know what you're going in there and you

40
00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:20.460
guys are gonna have sex and that's it.
What about funny,

41
00:02:20.461 --> 00:02:23.430
one of the funnier things that I've read as far as like just all this extreme

42
00:02:23.431 --> 00:02:27.960
mindset that's out there about politics that's out there,
about,

43
00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:29.760
about this me too stuff.
Everything is just,

44
00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:31.930
you have to be like all away on the other side of Rome,

45
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.330
against the wall all the way on.
The other one is um,
Oh God,
dude,

46
00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:38.850
I'm getting so old.
I literally forgot my point right in the middle of it.

47
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.560
I swear to God.
I was going to make the greatest point.
I literally just fucking,

48
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.330
what the fuck was it?
Oh,
I know.
This is going to be a lot of this by the way.

49
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.550
Uh,
uh,

50
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.870
coercion is not consent is what they said.

51
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.780
When you coerce somebody into doing something that is not consent.

52
00:02:57.781 --> 00:03:00.130
So I was thinking like,
okay,
does that mean I don't have to pay

53
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.000
<v 1>my bank loan?
This is fucking month on my Alma Mater,
my car loan.</v>

54
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.690
Hey Buddy,
you don't want this man.
You want the turbo man,

55
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:09.820
you come around the corner,
they're here and that engine,

56
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.190
the whole fucking world is coercion.
Everybody,
our whole business,

57
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.150
everything you,
anytime you sell anything,
any of it.

58
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.470
Half the Shit my wife does to me,
dude.

59
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:27.280
If coercion is not consent in women actually stuck by that,

60
00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:31.390
would brunch still exist?
And that's a good point.
No,
no guy.

61
00:03:31.391 --> 00:03:34.360
If you actually could see,
do you want to go to that?
No,
I do not.

62
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.440
And then she can be like,
Oh,
I'm on mine.
That's coercion.

63
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.660
Like cause you immediately,
you're like,
oh

64
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.030
<v 0>fuck.
I don't want her to cry.
Anytime a guy goes to Brown,</v>

65
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.750
she's taken the bullet on something.
Oh my word.
The worst is when they come up,

66
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.410
they said it's going to be like 40 minutes.
Is that going to be,

67
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.950
can you still stand like you have the option to say no.
I mean,
I say no.

68
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.130
That's why I fight with my wife so much.
No,
let's get outta here.
Yeah,
we could.

69
00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.870
I can literally Google how to make fucking,
no pun intended,
eggs Florentine.

70
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.040
Go to the supermarket.
It's eggs and steam.
Fucking spinach on an English muffin.

71
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.020
I can figure this out.
No,
but I just as a fun RB on here,

72
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.960
so look,
obviously it's great that there's a form now that all,
all these,
these,

73
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.260
these,
these,
some of this shit,

74
00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:20.290
this guy's did like who the fuck knew people did that?
I mean,

75
00:04:20.291 --> 00:04:22.880
I knew there was fucking creeps out there,
but like now it's just,

76
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.360
it's getting to the point,
but with not,
it's not getting to the point,

77
00:04:25.361 --> 00:04:29.230
but there's been a few where there's a few things where it's like you couldn't

78
00:04:29.231 --> 00:04:30.520
handle that amongst yourselves.

79
00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:34.390
Like did I need to know all the gory details of what you guys did here?

80
00:04:34.391 --> 00:04:36.280
And then there's other ones that are just complete bullshit,

81
00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:39.190
but I still don't feel that we're at a place where you can actually say that

82
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.460
because I think if you do,
then then what?
Then you're a rapist.

83
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.630
<v 1>Yeah.
Then yeah,
absolutely.
You can donate and you have understand women now,</v>

84
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.230
they just said,
we just want the guys to listen.
We don't want them to respond.

85
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.950
Don't come back like you're in a relationship and when your girls complained

86
00:04:54.951 --> 00:04:58.010
about something,
that wall,
I know how to fix it.
But just listen.

87
00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.210
<v 0>That makes sense.
If what they're saying is true.
Yeah,</v>

88
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.910
exactly know if you,
but if you're telling a fucking,

89
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.540
if you're talking about apples and you say in their oranges and then you're

90
00:05:11.881 --> 00:05:15.450
telling me I'm supposed to shut the fuck up and then watch somebody I know lose

91
00:05:15.451 --> 00:05:19.410
their fucking life,
their career,
that doesn't make sense either.

92
00:05:19.411 --> 00:05:22.890
And I feel like a lot of people feel that and everyone's choosing like self

93
00:05:22.891 --> 00:05:25.670
preservation.
Like,
sorry,
I keep hitting the table here.
Like,
uh,

94
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.970
I like the Golden Globes,
right when you went to that,
it's like,
dude,

95
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.080
if you didn't have a black shirt underneath the of Tuxedo,
I mean you,
you,

96
00:05:34.081 --> 00:05:37.950
you are finished.
That meant you advocated sexual assault that night.

97
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.210
Then you had a word of pin.
Okay.
Time's up thing.
But here's the thing,

98
00:05:42.211 --> 00:05:45.810
you literally could have just sexually assaulted somebody but wore a black shirt

99
00:05:45.811 --> 00:05:50.370
and had the pen and no one would fuck with you.
Right.
So I don't eat,
I don't,

100
00:05:50.371 --> 00:05:53.700
I'm old.
I,
so I don't,
I don't get what's going on anymore.
I don't get it.

101
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.040
Sorry man.
You're here to sell a book.
No,
no.
I'm want to get

102
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.840
<v 1>into,
no,
I do want to get into it.
No,
absolutely.
I mean there's,</v>

103
00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.890
the story that we're talking about is just insane.
You know,
there was,

104
00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.930
there was oral sex performed both time,
two times on each,
on each other.

105
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.770
And then when he wanted to have intercourse,
she,
he's,
she's like,
Nah,

106
00:06:12.771 --> 00:06:16.130
I don't know.
And he's like,
all right,
we'll hang or whatever like that.

107
00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:20.720
And then he had a funny line.
No,
I though it was a funny joke.
So he goes,

108
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.220
come on,
let's just have intercourse cause everybody,
and she goes,
you know what,

109
00:06:24.221 --> 00:06:26.390
I,
I'd rather wait for the second date for that.

110
00:06:26.391 --> 00:06:29.840
And he was at his place and he goes,
so if I pour you a new glass of wine,

111
00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.360
is that considered a second day?
That's a fucking funny line.

112
00:06:32.361 --> 00:06:36.230
And a guys throwing it out there,
it's a desperate Lonnie.
It is funny.

113
00:06:36.231 --> 00:06:37.190
And then she goes,
no.
And then,

114
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.110
and then they hung out for a little longer and she goes,

115
00:06:39.111 --> 00:06:41.510
I'm just going to go home.
She wasn't upset.
He goes,
okay,

116
00:06:41.511 --> 00:06:44.570
I'll get you a car service center in a car.
Texted the next day.

117
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.350
I had a good time.
He last night.
Well I did.
And then that's how it started.

118
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.470
Some of these,
these,
these,
these,
uh,
what do you call them?

119
00:06:51.471 --> 00:06:53.410
The cougars after a show.
Like if you want,

120
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.040
if you go out and you're selling anything,
dude,

121
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.800
you gotta get manhandled when you're out there.

122
00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.360
Bowman handled once a weekend and happens to me,

123
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:03.770
cause I sell merchandise after show once a weekend.
Oh yeah.
Grab my ass.

124
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.500
Literally something.
If you did it like over put Po,
Po,

125
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.460
put your hand on my wife's tit.
No,
it's okay.
Or a girl goes,
hey,

126
00:07:10.461 --> 00:07:13.100
put it on my tits.
Come.
We'll be funny.
Or every time,

127
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:17.240
all the time you got to come out after a show now you know like when those guys

128
00:07:17.241 --> 00:07:20.250
wear that suit where you fucking dismantle a bomb,

129
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.910
you've got to come up happening.
All made a lit.
Well tell me,

130
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.730

Cause I already like,
I love the title,

131
00:07:25.731 --> 00:07:30.130
it's everybody.
Everybody is awful and then parentheses except you to,

132
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.140
I like how I heard that was everybody,
you know,

133
00:07:33.141 --> 00:07:36.920
on Facebook going on and on about how great they are and like how the world's so

134
00:07:36.921 --> 00:07:40.710
awful and you know,
I don't know,
just having the whole,
you know,

135
00:07:40.711 --> 00:07:44.300
Selfie the selfie generation.
Yeah.
That's basically what it is.

136
00:07:44.301 --> 00:07:46.610
It just calling people out bad Facebook posts,
you know,

137
00:07:46.611 --> 00:07:50.030
people brag and people looking for attention,
you know,

138
00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:51.590
you know the per person that posts so,

139
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.370
and I'm on my way to the hospital and they just leave it at that.
I go,
okay,

140
00:07:55.371 --> 00:07:58.100
so now you're going to get 50.
What's wrong yet?
Where are you?
Okay,

141
00:07:58.101 --> 00:08:01.730
if I lived in New Jersey,
I'd be there for you,
but I can do,

142
00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:04.130
please keep us updated.
Is Everything okay?

143
00:08:04.131 --> 00:08:07.850
And then at the end it was just a sore throat.
Oh yeah.
You know what I mean?

144
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.910
It's never,
you always figure out these,
these,

145
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.700
these things like this crank Yankers all the way to this.

146
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:18.200
You always fun terrorizing telemarketers.
You always find like that,

147
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.170
that thing that,
that people are like,
I don't know what's,

148
00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.090
I've always see whenever you do a project,

149
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:27.140
I always think I wish right fucking there was hanging right there and you just,

150
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:31.850
you up like this.
You've done the,
um,
the uh,
uh,
what was,

151
00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:34.760
what was the show on VH one?
I just went blank.
That metal show.
That metal show.

152
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:37.880
Yeah.
Yeah.
How did you know that there was going to be,
you know,

153
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:41.960
like there was a bunch of people like me who wanted to know what Bobby blots or

154
00:08:41.961 --> 00:08:45.410
was doing.
I was like,
I was so excited to see all those guys.

155
00:08:45.411 --> 00:08:49.970
Like there was such a huge part of my life and I,
you know,
a part of my life,

156
00:08:49.971 --> 00:08:53.000
you know,
when you're a teenager,
he's a drama for rat by the way,

157
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:55.440
as a paint just being a teenager where

158
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:59.760
<v 0>there's sort of all of this exciting stuff and then all of this scary and</v>

159
00:08:59.761 --> 00:09:04.350
depressing shit all happening at the same time and that music was so great and

160
00:09:04.351 --> 00:09:07.650
so fun that like,
I mean all of those guys in those,

161
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:11.790
those bands to me are on the same level of like the fonts were like when I was a

162
00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:14.700
really little kid,
like the Fonz,
I had the trading cards and they like,

163
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.250
literally you're looking at somebody like made my childhood happier.

164
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:21.090
When I watched your show,
that metal show,
I was like,
oh my God,

165
00:09:21.091 --> 00:09:25.620
I fucking loved that guy.
Like what?
What is,
uh,
is it just how your brain works?

166
00:09:25.621 --> 00:09:27.870
Like how do you always seem to,
to,
to find,

167
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:28.481
<v 2>I don't know.</v>

168
00:09:28.481 --> 00:09:32.350
I think we just got into the good time VH one classic was like looking for one

169
00:09:32.351 --> 00:09:34.710
original program that didn't have anything on it.

170
00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.620
Just show them repeats of just old music videos and we pitched like a heavy

171
00:09:38.621 --> 00:09:41.800
metal talk show like the tonight show for ACDC fans.
They said,
okay,

172
00:09:41.801 --> 00:09:45.370
we'll give you money for one pilot.
We pulled Lita Ford out of retirement.

173
00:09:45.371 --> 00:09:47.980
She was like,
didn't do anything for like 20 years.
She was living on an island,

174
00:09:47.981 --> 00:09:51.830
raising her kids.
So we had her as a pilot episode where like,
all right,

175
00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:56.110
there's no,
she's back on the road.
She never sees her kids.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Great.

176
00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.590
Mommy.
She goes to being a great mom till we get,
we gave her exposure.
It's like,

177
00:09:59.591 --> 00:10:00.740
oh damn,
I got a career.

178
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:03.610
And next thing I know she put three albums out in the last nine years.
Oh,

179
00:10:03.611 --> 00:10:07.750
that's awesome.
And then,
uh,
you know,
and luckily to head of like VH one classic,

180
00:10:07.751 --> 00:10:11.500
this guy used to be a d,
like a metal DJ up in Buffalo.
He goes,
I love this show.

181
00:10:11.501 --> 00:10:14.830
Put It on the air.
You know,
it's going to be a shitty bar budget.

182
00:10:14.831 --> 00:10:16.300
And I remember my manager goes,

183
00:10:16.301 --> 00:10:19.060
this is the worst contract I've ever seen in my life.

184
00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:21.520
You sure you want to sign us?
Like go,
yeah,
look,
whatever.
Who Cares?

185
00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:26.440
At least we'll be on the air.
And we did 140 episodes.
What?
Seven seasons?
Who is,

186
00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.250
uh,
some of your favorites that,

187
00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:31.360
cause I knew that you were kind of already in that world a little bit like a lot

188
00:10:31.361 --> 00:10:34.150
of you guys like you Norton and all those kinds of big Jay,

189
00:10:34.151 --> 00:10:36.670
you guys seem to like know brewer.
Broer yeah,

190
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.280
I seem to know like rock stars and stuff like that.

191
00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.950
You were kind of already in that world,
but when you went there,

192
00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:46.210
what was like your bucket list of guests and were you able to get most of them?

193
00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.630
Yeah,
I mean with Tony Iommi,
you know,
we got Geezer Butler,

194
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:54.580
Ronnie James Dio before he passed away was on twice.
Then we get Marilyn Manson.

195
00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:57.910
You know,
we've got Tom Morello from rage against the machine.
I'm a huge fan.

196
00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.760
We had Steve Harris from iron maiden,
so every,

197
00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:04.090
every season was somebody different.
Like you gotta be kidding.
Sammy Hagar,

198
00:11:04.091 --> 00:11:05.140
Michael Anthony,

199
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.090
you know I loved about Steve Harris was even people who had no new,
nothing

200
00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:14.050
<v 0>about music would be like,
that guy's an unbelievable bass player.
Yeah,
he was.</v>

201
00:11:14.051 --> 00:11:16.870
Yeah,
his fingers just flying.
Um,

202
00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:20.740
actually iron maiden was the one that when I first wanted to play drums,

203
00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.710
it was their drum.
Nicko mcbrain that was one of those,
uh,

204
00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:27.730
one of those screen from a long beach,
you know,
that they filmed to whatever.

205
00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:29.140
And uh,

206
00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.320
I just remember when they finally went behind him because he used to always see

207
00:11:32.321 --> 00:11:33.010
the honors,
right?

208
00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:36.050
<v 2>Yeah.
You can never see him.
He's buried in the sand and I saw the legs moving.</v>

209
00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:36.310
Yeah,

210
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:37.750
<v 0>too.
I was like,
that looks fucking cool.</v>

211
00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:42.190
And I already failed on guitar because he actually had to like no notes and shit

212
00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:45.640
like that.
And just coming from more of a sports background,
I was that guy.

213
00:11:45.641 --> 00:11:46.750
He just kind of beat the shit

214
00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:51.700
<v 2>I know.
After,
after that looks like fun after a,
you know,
a big patriot loss,</v>

215
00:11:51.701 --> 00:11:54.220
you can know palm pounding the drums.
Oh,
speaking

216
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.420
<v 1>of which hat,
what do you,
I know you're a,
an,
there's a famous story about you.</v>

217
00:11:58.421 --> 00:12:00.720
You're a huge Miami Dolphin Fan.
This,

218
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:05.730
this story that Keith Robinson is told me probably a dozen times and I never

219
00:12:06.431 --> 00:12:09.190
stopped them because I love it was you were on a,

220
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:13.660
you're on some flight watching a dolphin game and you will,
you are going,

221
00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:14.980
please tell me it's true,
right.

222
00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.940
You were landing in the stewardess told you to shut your phone off or whatever

223
00:12:18.941 --> 00:12:22.980
you were watching you,
you refuse to cause yeah,
it was an important part.

224
00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.520
It's like,
this is before cell phones.

225
00:12:24.521 --> 00:12:26.950
I have one of those little TVs with the antenna,
you know,

226
00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:30.930
it's a little bar and it was a play.
It was a dolphin to off Bobby Kelly.

227
00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.690
He's buying the next thing.
He always had that shit.
This was like an,

228
00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.440
I don't know,
probably 99 it was a,

229
00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:38.610
well I worked 98 when Montana was on the chiefs,

230
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:43.060
there was a dolphin chief playoff game and I was on a flight from Florida and it

231
00:12:43.061 --> 00:12:46.000
was on like the local ABC cause there's a playoff game,
right?

232
00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:49.240
So I have one of those little old school TVs when an antenna and I watched it

233
00:12:49.241 --> 00:12:52.030
under a blanket the whole game because I didn't have to switch.

234
00:12:52.031 --> 00:12:53.440
Like if my mom were in South Carolina,

235
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:57.940
I've got to find the ABC affiliate there and then we'll have Mike and I'm

236
00:12:57.941 --> 00:13:00.940
switching around like this and I and Baltimore.
I got to find the other church.

237
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:04.070
So I watched the whole game and the woman came over like 20 minutes left.

238
00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:07.060
You have a TV on,
shut that off.
It's going to affect the plane.
I go too bad.

239
00:13:07.061 --> 00:13:11.620
I go with it.
I go,
it's 2121 and Merinos driving with two minutes left.

240
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.200
She goes,
you've got to Chicago.
I'm not shutting it off.
I don't care.

241
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:15.430
And even when the plane landed,

242
00:13:15.431 --> 00:13:18.310
I still watching the whole thing and they won like right as the plane landed.

243
00:13:18.311 --> 00:13:19.690
I'm like,
yes.
Oh,

244
00:13:19.691 --> 00:13:23.980
that's why it was pre nine 11 it was pre nine 11 and I had that little,
yeah.

245
00:13:23.981 --> 00:13:26.950
And you couldn't have any,
any kind of electronic device on the plane?
No,

246
00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.640
but I'm saying if now a few said no.
Oh yeah.
That would have been like,
you know,

247
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:32.630
like the CIA.
Absolutely.

248
00:13:32.631 --> 00:13:36.130
I would just say would come on and fucking been waiting for me when I learned it

249
00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:39.550
.
But yeah,
I would not shut the TV off on the note.
I will add it on the black.

250
00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.610
I didn't get car to like 20 minutes left in the flight.
I watched the whole game.

251
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:46.270
My girlfriend at the time,
we sit next to me.
I was screaming,
she was miserable.

252
00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.710
She was way to end a bad trip and I get too bad breaking up again anyway when I

253
00:13:50.711 --> 00:13:54.220
get back.
Oh,
I didn't know.
Oh,

254
00:13:54.221 --> 00:13:56.230
I thought you wanted like a jet blue because I was thinking,

255
00:13:56.231 --> 00:13:58.720
well why wouldn't they just shut the thing?
I'll add your own teeth.

256
00:13:58.721 --> 00:14:01.430
And my own little TV.
I brought it just in case they go to,

257
00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:03.660
I was already doing the math am my good.
If they win,

258
00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:06.670
they're going to play on Saturday at four 30 might.
That's when my flight is.

259
00:14:06.671 --> 00:14:09.550
So I'm bringing my TV,
just the case.
And that's exactly what happened.

260
00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:12.450
<v 0>Wow.
Do you know what the only the Patriots beat Seattle.</v>

261
00:14:12.451 --> 00:14:15.270
I was flying from Sydney,
Australia to like Auckland,

262
00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:19.140
New Zealand and I missed the whole game cause I was thinking that it's the super

263
00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:22.770
bowl.
They show it around the world,
they're going to have it on.
Like,
you know,

264
00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:26.370
they had TVs,
all they had was soccer.
I was like,
you gotta be kidding me.

265
00:14:26.371 --> 00:14:30.180
So when I got off the plane,
I knew it was towards the end of the game,

266
00:14:30.181 --> 00:14:34.740
but I just had to know.
So I told,
I asked my wife,
I go,
uh,
I go,

267
00:14:34.741 --> 00:14:37.260
what's the score?
And she's like,
Oh,

268
00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:42.030
I'm says the Patriots are winning.
And I was like,
really?
You know,

269
00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.270
cause I was still,
you know,
after those two giant losses,
I was like,
Oh God,

270
00:14:45.271 --> 00:14:49.260
now he's going to be three and three,
you know,
fuck.
And,
um,
I go,

271
00:14:49.261 --> 00:14:52.640
how much time's left?
And she's like,
um,

272
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:57.130
<v 1>it's says it's over.
I ain't go no way.
And then it looked that way.</v>

273
00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:00.230
They fucking started screaming in the middle of New Zealand,
look like a maniac.

274
00:15:00.231 --> 00:15:05.231
And then it went back to the hotel and they were just showing the Superbowl and

275
00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:07.670
this weird channel with no commercials.

276
00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.370
And I watched it twice back to back.

277
00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.490
And then I watched it again the next morning and I couldn't,
like,

278
00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:17.750
I had no idea about that whole play in the end or anything like that.
But,
uh,
um,

279
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:21.380
anyways,
getting back to the initial thing I was gonna ask you,
a lot of people,

280
00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:26.450
you know,
are talking about the Jaguars and the defense,
you know,
and uh,

281
00:15:26.451 --> 00:15:27.950
they go into New England,
you know,

282
00:15:27.951 --> 00:15:30.950
nobody thought that they were going to go into Pittsburgh.
Well,
some people did,

283
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.520
but they went in there,
they won there,
they beat buffalo bills,

284
00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:38.720
but they beat the bills.
And it was like this snooze fest.
And then,
you know,

285
00:15:38.721 --> 00:15:41.840
they went into,
uh,
the Steelers and they had like a shootout.

286
00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:44.840
So everybody's talking about how great their defenses,
and I'm still like,

287
00:15:44.841 --> 00:15:48.590
they just gave up like 40,
41 points,
but the week before,
who the fuck are they?

288
00:15:48.591 --> 00:15:53.540
So Jim Florentine,
Amanda brought a TV on a fucking plane in 1999.

289
00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:58.790
What is your gut feeling of patriots or a patriots?
Absolutely.

290
00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:02.900
You,
you don't win in Foxborough and you know,
in Patriots Gillette Stadium,

291
00:16:02.901 --> 00:16:04.880
you don't,
when they're a championship game,

292
00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:08.540
you think Bella checks does feels we're looking past the Jaguars waiting for the

293
00:16:08.541 --> 00:16:12.700
championship game.
Always fucking do they always do it.
If you see him,

294
00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:15.260
we came out that year,
we played them.
They had already,

295
00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.630
they had already bought their fucking plane.
Like that's the,
you know,

296
00:16:17.631 --> 00:16:18.464
the urban myth.

297
00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:22.130
They've had already bought the plane tickets and hotel reservations down in New

298
00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:24.800
Orleans.
Um,
that,
yeah,

299
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:29.420
we've got bet Belicheck to prepare for Blake Bortles.
They've got no shot.

300
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:31.040
Yeah.

301
00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.460
I don't care what kind of defense they're running back there running back got

302
00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:36.010
hurt too.
Yeah.
With that defense looks good but to do,

303
00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.300
but that's all right Birdie,
we'll pick them apart.
I find some.

304
00:16:38.301 --> 00:16:39.320
But last week they did not look.

305
00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:43.610
Some guy will come off the practice squad tomorrow and oh catch 10 passes on

306
00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.070
Sunday is a thing.
How long can we do this?

307
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:49.500
We just keep doing it until he doesn't have a number one.
This isn't,

308
00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:51.440
we don't have a number one receiver right now.

309
00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:56.750
I'm with Edelman being out the whole year and uh,
you know,

310
00:16:56.751 --> 00:17:00.620
I know we got Gronk he's a tight end but like are,
you know there's just,

311
00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.930
there's a lot of passes.
They,
I don't know.
No,

312
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.170
there's the one guy he fucking stops.
It's like keep running,

313
00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.260
keep it and not have time to see Brady going.
Like just keep fucking running.

314
00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:11.300
So I don't know like this,
this game scares me.

315
00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:15.020
This game scares me cause they can do the whole fad diet chapter till then I

316
00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:17.630
suppose to bay here I got nothing to lose.
But Baba Baba Baba,

317
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:21.020
I'm getting all nervous about that now.
I think that they had their run,

318
00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:23.480
I mean if the bills had any kind of quarterback,

319
00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:24.860
they should have been won that game.

320
00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:28.610
The first playoff game and Pittsburgh was waiting from New England.

321
00:17:28.611 --> 00:17:30.770
They overlooked that there weren't prepared you sort of first quarter,

322
00:17:30.771 --> 00:17:34.990
they weren't even but you know their head was in a different game.
Patriots good.

323
00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.330
The only problem they could have as maybe if they play Minnesota in Minnesota

324
00:17:38.331 --> 00:17:40.790
because the game will be a home game.
As long as I was nervous about it.

325
00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:44.300
It's like the saints,
like I called that saints game.
I called and I was like,

326
00:17:44.301 --> 00:17:47.300
drew Brees is going to go in there.
He gets no respect.

327
00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:49.920
He's like the third all time passer and all that shit.

328
00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:52.470
He's going to go in there and I kept saying that,
you know,

329
00:17:52.471 --> 00:17:54.840
all these Minnesota fans,
we're going to go to the mall of America,

330
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:56.670
go into the giant Kleenex store,

331
00:17:56.671 --> 00:17:59.670
and they were going to be crying and everything and exactly what the fuck I said

332
00:17:59.671 --> 00:18:03.690
was going to happen until that last play with 14 seconds left,

333
00:18:03.691 --> 00:18:08.250
which I have never ever in the history of watching people fuck up.

334
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.610
I have never seen anybody do what that poor kid did.

335
00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:16.880
It's like he put his head down and stop looking at the guy and then he throws,

336
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:21.420
he basically threw a block,
took out his own fucking guy.
It's just,

337
00:18:21.421 --> 00:18:26.220
I've never,
I still cannot fucking believe that that happened.
We,
uh,

338
00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.850
I was watching the game,
a bunch of friends of ours at 17,
nothing half time,

339
00:18:29.851 --> 00:18:31.980
and my brother gambles.
He's like,
all right,
look,

340
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:34.740
there's 10 to one odds you want to put on,
on the saints,

341
00:18:34.741 --> 00:18:37.370
come back and win this game.
So we put,
um,

342
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:39.930
like $2,000 in a pot.

343
00:18:39.931 --> 00:18:44.160
So I would've won 800 bucks if they would've just made a talk right there.

344
00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:45.480
Fred was five,
right?

345
00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.540
There's Greg was five but we had to just sort of saying to win the game from the

346
00:18:48.541 --> 00:18:51.150
second half they were down 79th and a half time.
I go,
I'll do that.

347
00:18:51.151 --> 00:18:54.360
So they had to,
when the half a win the game when the whole game at 17 nothing.

348
00:18:54.361 --> 00:18:59.130
I'm like I'll put 880 bucks in.
I would've won 800 bucks and I'm watching that.

349
00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:02.700
We're all,
can you guys doing?
We're like,
yes.
All right,
good.

350
00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:06.000
We got this or you owe this and right now I'm only down this and this and then

351
00:19:06.001 --> 00:19:07.260
we'll watch the last play.
Like

352
00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:13.290
picture it all you guys walking and talking to the narrow with buying your

353
00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:16.380
wife's furs and stuff.
When I say what I say,
don't buy anything.

354
00:19:16.381 --> 00:19:19.890
Don't take it back and out of here.
Oh my God.

355
00:19:19.891 --> 00:19:24.120
That's fucking do I wish you guys had the reaction video that you guys just

356
00:19:24.121 --> 00:19:27.410
talking about all this shit.
I was already crossing off my bets on my car.
I cool.

357
00:19:27.411 --> 00:19:29.090
I'm only down 30 for the day.
I'm this,

358
00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:32.480
you took this and we're just already figuring out like,
we got this,

359
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:33.770
that's one of those games.

360
00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:37.500
I immediately went to youtube to see people's reactions to it and these fucking

361
00:19:37.501 --> 00:19:38.334
nerds,

362
00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:42.570
we're like their first people that put their up and it was the worst reaction

363
00:19:42.571 --> 00:19:46.860
ever.
They're like,
oh my God.
Wow,

364
00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:50.100
that's crazy.
They already monetized it and everything.

365
00:19:50.101 --> 00:19:51.300
I was so fucking mad at him.

366
00:19:51.301 --> 00:19:56.301
I wanted to see saints fans crying and Viking fans crying because I figured like

367
00:19:57.931 --> 00:20:01.500
the best reaction video I ever saw was when,
when Auburn,

368
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.020
my favorite one and wound Auburn caught that,

369
00:20:04.021 --> 00:20:08.430
that field goal that came up short against Alabama and the dude ran the whole

370
00:20:08.431 --> 00:20:11.160
thing back like Alabama was kicking to uh,

371
00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:15.120
to win the game and it was a long field goal.

372
00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:17.190
And if they miss who gives a shit,
we go into overtime.

373
00:20:17.191 --> 00:20:20.750
I believe that was the scenario and it came up short and you can return it in.

374
00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.650
The Auburn Guy fucking caught it and I,

375
00:20:22.651 --> 00:20:25.590
they caught him sleeping and he ran it like a 105 yards back.

376
00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:27.540
And my favorite one was these two girls.

377
00:20:27.541 --> 00:20:31.620
One was for ob and one was for Alabama and the one screen we can go the other

378
00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.030
ones like freaking out and then the end,

379
00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:36.570
the fucking Auburn girl looks to the Alabama girl who's just totally stunned.

380
00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:41.710
She was like,
y'all just lost.
Great.

381
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:46.360
So,
um,
anyways,
I keep forgetting to talk about the book.
So,
um,

382
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:50.260
you can preorder this thing.
Wait,
where do they go?
They go to Itunes,

383
00:20:50.261 --> 00:20:52.420
they go to I book.
What do you,
where do you go from Amazon?

384
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:57.190
It's all the links up on Amazon.
Oh,
the link is up on Amazon.
It's Jim Florentine.

385
00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:00.410
Everybody is awful except you and comes out February 20th.
Just me.

386
00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:02.680
It's basically based off my podcast where I just,
you know,

387
00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:07.600
people send in like bad Facebook posts or like vanity plates,
you know,

388
00:21:07.601 --> 00:21:09.210
awful vantage.
This is some of this stuff.

389
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:12.640
Bed of Hennessy pussy power wash,

390
00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:17.170
awful Facebook rule number 10,
drown us in dumb ass details.

391
00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.540
Oh this is fucking great.
And I,

392
00:21:19.541 --> 00:21:23.560
these are actual Facebook posts by people I posted and then I just,
you know,

393
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:27.780
just take them,
take them down.
Oh my God.

394
00:21:27.781 --> 00:21:32.420
The weather posts in Ohio,
you know,
Mother Nature,
you know,
go away.
Okay.

395
00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:35.310
Do you know what's funny is earlier this year I went to this fucking award show,

396
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:37.460
<v 3>uh,</v>

397
00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:39.470
<v 1>in one of these ones that was not televised.</v>

398
00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:43.820
That's the level that I'm at in this business,
right?
So I had a friend of mine,

399
00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:46.640
he's got k,
man,
this is going to be like this big fucking thing,
blah,
blah,
blah,

400
00:21:46.641 --> 00:21:49.010
blah,
blah.
You know,
eventually maybe it'll be a big award show.

401
00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:53.040
Do you want to go with,
my wife loves music and he had a double date club,
blah.

402
00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:58.130
Blessing.
All right,
let's go.
So right before we're going to go,

403
00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:01.320
the other couple has to cancer cause simple shits and I,

404
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:03.950
we're going to this fucking thing that I,
you know,
like,
oh Jesus Christ.

405
00:22:03.951 --> 00:22:07.330
So we show up,
dude.
I swear to God,
every fucking person say,

406
00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.530
say 20 people want awards that night.

407
00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:14.660
19 people crate and talked about how hard it was and everything they went

408
00:22:14.661 --> 00:22:17.540
through and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And I was just sitting there.

409
00:22:17.541 --> 00:22:22.400
I just wanted to yell out,
you're in your 20s
how hard can you,

410
00:22:22.401 --> 00:22:27.380
10 years ago you were in high school and you're accepting of fucking award and

411
00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:31.310
you've got to hit album.
How fucking hard.
Good.
How are going to have Ben?

412
00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:37.010
I was like almost 20 years and still on a fucking Futon,
right?
Nothing.

413
00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:37.940
I don't know.
I was,

414
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.590
I was paying my bills with change at 36 years old and oh Jesus.

415
00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.840
Taking it down there to change thing at the supermarket,

416
00:22:44.841 --> 00:22:48.720
you know like they take like 8 cents off a dollar.
That was paying my at 36 yeah.

417
00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:52.780
And here's the thing,
like who gives a fuck?
Like I don't know.
I like,

418
00:22:52.781 --> 00:22:54.980
I don't know.
The entertainment business is difficult.

419
00:22:56.120 --> 00:23:00.230
Like is it easy for somebody else?
Nobody goes into this business.

420
00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.090
Even if you make it in two seconds,

421
00:23:02.091 --> 00:23:06.440
then all that means is you are going to get fucking slammed back down to the

422
00:23:06.441 --> 00:23:08.300
ground.
Because when you start to dip,

423
00:23:08.301 --> 00:23:10.970
you're not gonna know how to handle it and you're going to fucking freak out.

424
00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:15.470
It's better to get punched in the face repeatedly as you're walking up the hill.

425
00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:17.930
Other than to just be on the chair lift,

426
00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:21.590
go right up to the top and the first time you'll drop a ski or something like

427
00:23:21.591 --> 00:23:23.820
that,
all that you just going to go right down the other side of the mountain.

428
00:23:23.821 --> 00:23:26.780
So I actually,

429
00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:30.860
it was one of the few times where I was semi ruining something.

430
00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:34.640
Did your wife know you were annoyed?
Yeah,
but she thought it was funny.
She did.

431
00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:38.360
She didn't think it was funny because right from right in the beginning it was

432
00:23:38.361 --> 00:23:42.050
annoying.
I got there and this like I'm standing there,
you know the panic,

433
00:23:42.051 --> 00:23:42.731
you know when you,
you,

434
00:23:42.731 --> 00:23:45.410
you get like you're on like the guest list and you know they're going to your

435
00:23:45.411 --> 00:23:48.040
name and the psycho.
I don't see it.
And then they found it.
It was like,

436
00:23:48.041 --> 00:23:50.330
I had like this relief and all of a sudden the security guys just like,

437
00:23:50.331 --> 00:23:53.270
excuse me sir,
sir,
I'm going to need you to clear this and we need to clear it.

438
00:23:53.271 --> 00:23:55.490
And I'm thinking like,
I'm in this totally open area.

439
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:59.720
This woman had the fucking walked by.
It was just like some,
I dunno,

440
00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:01.310
I dunno who the fuck it was,

441
00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:05.360
but like she literally had 10 feet on either side of us and the guy was still

442
00:24:05.361 --> 00:24:07.830
telling me I needed to get further up against like,

443
00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:11.990
do you want me to become part of the paint?
I don't know.
So sorry.

444
00:24:11.991 --> 00:24:16.430
This is just podcast is becoming about me complaining.
No,
no,
no.
That's perfect.

445
00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:18.980
That's what it should be.
I don't know.

446
00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:20.650
Every once in a while I want to have a guest and I tried.

447
00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:25.540
I want to lighten it up or something.
How is the uh,
lighten it up?
Okay.
How's,

448
00:24:25.541 --> 00:24:30.440
how's The New York comedy scene?
It's great.
It's been,
have you been,
uh,

449
00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:33.350
you know,
I moved away and believe it or not,
like over 10 years ago.

450
00:24:33.351 --> 00:24:37.780
So when I go back now,
I don't know who a lot of the new people are all,

451
00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:41.000
all of the,
uh,
does a ton of them.
Yeah.

452
00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:43.790
As it should be in a good,
you know,
to good though.

453
00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.010
It's thrive in men has all the clubs,

454
00:24:46.011 --> 00:24:50.150
they're packed and I really liked to stand the stand is my club in the city and

455
00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:54.980
his great love that place.
And there's,
there's a danger fields I still love.

456
00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:59.330
I haven't walked in there and 15 years and then the New York Comedy Club,

457
00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:03.450
uh,
Al doesn't own it anymore.
No,
it's gotten better.
All right.

458
00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.090
It's actually a decent gig.

459
00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:09.290
And then they got the village on the ground is like the comedy cellar and they

460
00:25:09.291 --> 00:25:12.530
got like three or three like they did when I was in New York.

461
00:25:12.531 --> 00:25:15.860
The seller had the cellar,
they had a,

462
00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:20.570
the y I don't think they had the village is a village underground.

463
00:25:20.571 --> 00:25:23.330
I don't think they had that.
No.
He had like,
yeah,
they'll like,

464
00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:26.540
like playing monopoly.
Like they keep it,
they got three rooms.

465
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:30.260
You like 10 shows on a Saturday night.
It's incredible.

466
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:34.910
I remember I used to be so jealous of,
uh,
when I was living with Bobby Kelly.
Um,

467
00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:38.480
we would both have nine shows,
but I would be all over the city and he would,

468
00:25:38.481 --> 00:25:40.160
he would have three at the Boston,

469
00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:43.760
three at the was three at the cellar and he didn't have to take one cab.

470
00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:47.910
He could just walk to all of them and he,
you know,
you got paid 50 bucks a seat.

471
00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:52.400
Yeah.
So we have nine fifties and I'd have a bunch of twenties and fives.

472
00:25:52.401 --> 00:25:55.850
I'll smash together from jumping in cabs going from the strip down to the cellar

473
00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:00.170
backup to stand up New York.
Um,
can you do that anymore?

474
00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:03.770
I know they kind of switched away.
They,
some of those guys.
Yeah.

475
00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:07.250
You could still do what it's.
Um,
I,
I try to stay like one club,

476
00:26:07.251 --> 00:26:09.680
one or two maybe in New York comedy club to stand.

477
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:13.310
I don't feel like running around,
like rushing around,
you know,
I'm not,

478
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.730
I'm not my twenties anymore where I'm just jumping on.
I started doing this,

479
00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:19.550
running into another cycle back over here.
I'm like,
oh good.

480
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:22.700
And you know what I mean?
I'm working on my shit.
I know what I need to do.

481
00:26:22.701 --> 00:26:24.500
I'm like,
sometimes I look just like to stay in the same,

482
00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:26.600
it's like I'll do three shows that I did New Year's Eve.

483
00:26:26.601 --> 00:26:30.290
I did four shows at the stand to stay there all night.
Oh,
it's perfect.

484
00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.700
Other than the only thing that sucks is when they are in between shows and it

485
00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:36.500
gets a little pack.
But then they put him downstairs and you find,
yeah.

486
00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:37.641
What do you,
uh,

487
00:26:37.641 --> 00:26:40.520
how much stand up do you do with all these like TV shows and books and all that

488
00:26:40.521 --> 00:26:42.630
type?
How often do you get to get two weekends or a,

489
00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:43.980
I'm on the road two weekends a

490
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.390
<v 2>month.
Oh,
that's good.
Yeah.</v>

491
00:26:45.391 --> 00:26:49.380
And I do a one weekend in New York and then I take one weekend off.

492
00:26:49.381 --> 00:26:54.120
So I got my son one weekend a month alone also during the week to seven.

493
00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:56.580
That's amazing.
He's already getting into stand there.

494
00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:59.920
He's been on stage like five times and he plays like from your like restaurant,

495
00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:02.460
like the coolest kid ever.
Drums sing.
And now,

496
00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:06.090
now he's all about stand up now because I took them out.
Uh,
I,

497
00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:09.390
there was a show to Ronnie be Bennington does a show,

498
00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:13.600
his radio show at the hard rock in New York every year does a live show.

499
00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:16.860
There's 400 people.
It's sold out.
I'm going to get a segment where you go,
oh,

500
00:27:16.861 --> 00:27:20.730
comedians go up and tell an old joke.
So I brought my son with me and he goes,

501
00:27:20.731 --> 00:27:24.120
look,
if you want to go on stage,
you could tell an old joke is okay,
I will.

502
00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:27.210
And he went up there.
I introduced him to the place,
went nuts.

503
00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:30.030
He grabs the mic and I didn't even tell him.
I say,
he goes,
Oh,

504
00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.700
you guys ready to hear a funny joke?
And I'm like,
man,

505
00:27:32.701 --> 00:27:35.540
he's already working on a crowd.
It plays cause not something as a host.

506
00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:38.910
I know what he tells a joke and the play and it gets an applause break and he's

507
00:27:38.911 --> 00:27:41.730
up there and he did and we stood up on safe for another 10 minutes.

508
00:27:41.731 --> 00:27:44.910
He felt that ever since then he's like,
dad,
got a show tonight.
Come on,

509
00:27:44.911 --> 00:27:48.090
go get a show.
Let's just go get a show.
Just,
you know,
on stage,
right.

510
00:27:48.091 --> 00:27:50.490
You can go down to the club and go,
yeah,
I could come on.

511
00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:52.080
We've got to do which one are we do want to show,

512
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:55.770
<v 1>you know it's going to be funny is that when he has to do like a book report</v>

513
00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:59.130
about nervous,
she would get,
he's going to be like all amped up to do what?

514
00:27:59.131 --> 00:28:02.160
He's going to be psyched.
When I was in school I would just be like,

515
00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:05.520
I would be so scared.
And then she wouldn't call it,

516
00:28:05.521 --> 00:28:07.500
the teacher wouldn't call on me.
It'd be like,
thank God.

517
00:28:07.501 --> 00:28:10.590
And then I see my buddy go up and then when he'd be done I'd be like,
ah,
fuck.

518
00:28:10.591 --> 00:28:15.480
I wish I was him because it would be over.
And uh,
I had like a horrible,

519
00:28:15.481 --> 00:28:19.150
I had horrible fucking,
uh,
I guess was that stage fright?
Yeah.

520
00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:22.280
<v 2>Public speaking.
Yeah.
I mean speaking,
once I knew I wanted to do comedy,</v>

521
00:28:22.281 --> 00:28:23.900
it took me a year to get on stage.

522
00:28:23.901 --> 00:28:26.060
You get the balls to get on stage because I was petrified.

523
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:30.780
<v 1>That's what I did.
I gave myself a,
I made a new year's resolution in 1992.</v>

524
00:28:30.781 --> 00:28:34.080
I was like,
at some point in this year,
I gave myself a whole year to do.

525
00:28:34.081 --> 00:28:35.920
It was funny,
but the second I did it,
uh,

526
00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:40.740
all of a sudden there was a talent contest like in January and I just signed up

527
00:28:40.741 --> 00:28:44.640
for it.
And,
uh,
it was like a month out.
And then there was so many guys,

528
00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:48.810
they pushed it.
And so I started like right in the beginning of March.
And uh,

529
00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:52.790
yeah,
like horrible,
horrible,
like I wish,
like I actually hadn't,

530
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:56.340
I think that's great for a kid to,
um,

531
00:28:57.150 --> 00:29:01.290
I think it's great from to meet a lot of people,
you know,
like,
um,

532
00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:04.110
like we've had a lot of people come over the first year and my daughter's life.

533
00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:08.670
And um,
so like when people come over,
she's not really like,

534
00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:13.770
oh my God,
who's that?
It doesn't fuck with their universe.
And then to get them,

535
00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:18.840
you know,
to talk to the adults or speak publicly is something,

536
00:29:18.841 --> 00:29:23.460
I think that's a huge,
that's something I wish,
you know,
I was so fucking shy.

537
00:29:23.461 --> 00:29:26.610
I almost feel like someone needed to do that to kind of nudge me out.

538
00:29:26.611 --> 00:29:29.130
But if they did,
I probably wouldn't have been as fucked up.

539
00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:32.190
I would've become a true,
yeah.
I would have just been some guy.

540
00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:35.170
<v 2>It's funny the way up to management at this point,</v>

541
00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:36.790
and he's only in first grade and one's like,
oh,

542
00:29:36.791 --> 00:29:39.610
so he must be the class clown and classical.
No,
he's not.
I go,

543
00:29:39.611 --> 00:29:42.730
that's why he could be a good comic.
He's not the guy,
you know,
hey,

544
00:29:42.731 --> 00:29:45.610
look at me over here,
because those guys are never good.
Yeah.

545
00:29:45.611 --> 00:29:49.420
There's a lot of hacks in elementary,
you know,
like fart jokes,

546
00:29:49.421 --> 00:29:52.600
a lot of making face.
And those guys that try to do comedy later are terrible.

547
00:29:52.601 --> 00:29:53.650
That is terrible.
That,
you know,

548
00:29:53.651 --> 00:29:56.920
you want the quiet guy that just sitting back and observing everything and

549
00:29:57.130 --> 00:30:00.520
remembering and writing it down.
You don't want the guy jumping on the desk.

550
00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:02.790
That's the guy.
He's going to be a hack.
He's going to do any other guy.

551
00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.230
You end up meeting at your show later and he's just like,
dude,
I was 40.

552
00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:08.110
The Ui should have done this shit.
And you're like,
oh,
go,
go do it.

553
00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:09.380
Or if he does stand up,

554
00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.580
he's the guy who does the arms thing at the end where to go behind the comic and

555
00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:16.150
work the arms
about.
Great.

556
00:30:16.151 --> 00:30:18.520
Was that though the first time you saw it was hilarious.

557
00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:19.900
It was the greatest thing ever because I,

558
00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:24.340
so I had an itch on my crotch and they'd have some hot girl and see that the guy

559
00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:25.460
I know.

560
00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:26.490
<v 0>Do you know one of the,
uh,</v>

561
00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:30.720
one of the most misunderstood comedians of all time,

562
00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:35.790
I believe is Gallagher because everybody looks at him like he was this fucking

563
00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:39.060
guy smashing all this shit.
He was making fun of advertising.

564
00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:42.660
That's what that bit was,
right?
Sledge dramatic.
What the hell is it?

565
00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:45.300
And it didn't work,
but it was all this visual stuff.

566
00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:50.370
But so many people took it at face value.
They just wanted to go like,
oh my God,

567
00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:54.140
<v 2>God,
we're going to get like cottage cheese all in orange juice all over.</v>

568
00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:55.670
They never got the bit.

569
00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:58.470
<v 0>And what killed me is if you watched the beginning of his act,</v>

570
00:30:58.471 --> 00:31:02.970
he had some really,
really good material,
clever material.

571
00:31:02.971 --> 00:31:04.800
I don't what time Patrice rest,

572
00:31:04.801 --> 00:31:09.801
his soul was talking to him on the opie and Anthony Show and he was saying how,

573
00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:16.450
um,
you know,
you need to pick a path.
You know,
it was great.
You,

574
00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:19.950
they're going to do this Carlin stuff or you're going to be the guy smashing

575
00:31:19.951 --> 00:31:23.400
shit.
And like,
he just wasn't able to convey it in a way.

576
00:31:23.401 --> 00:31:27.130
And I remember listening to it,
I was driving,
I was listening to on the radio.

577
00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.550
He's just going like,
yes.
Yes,
exactly.

578
00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:32.760
He had that fucking bit where he sat down in the,
in the school desk.

579
00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:36.510
They did this whole bit where he starts talking about how weird words are

580
00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:40.530
spelled in our legs and our,
uh,
English language.
He started with the word.

581
00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:45.900
I just remember him going like,
something like,
uh,
I ended up going to like it.
Uh,

582
00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:50.730
like heard and then you point here,
is this a bird?
No.
Beard B a r d neat.

583
00:31:50.731 --> 00:31:54.510
When you did the whole fucking thing and in the end he got back to the word that

584
00:31:54.511 --> 00:31:57.750
he started with and then he just does it just all in circles.

585
00:31:57.751 --> 00:32:01.040
And that's why I didn't go to school.
It's like fucking great bit.
Yeah.

586
00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:03.870
For some reason he had to be sitting at a school desk when he did it.

587
00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:07.230
So everybody starts going,
always a prop guy.
I Dunno.

588
00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:10.400
<v 2>No,
I remember he used to do his standup.
I remember seeing like show Tom is a,</v>

589
00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:12.910
Katie was on roller skates.
Right.
Then they do a thing where he was,

590
00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:16.370
he had a giant couch and he put a trampoline in it and shit.
And like every,

591
00:32:16.371 --> 00:32:19.820
so everybody would remember that.
Right.
But in the middle of all that,

592
00:32:19.821 --> 00:32:23.540
he had this [inaudible].
I know he did.
I remember at the Andy we've,
but yeah,

593
00:32:23.541 --> 00:32:26.900
he was almost like Carl and back in a day,
like a good smart material.

594
00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:31.910
That was funny.
Yeah.
But yeah,
you come out on a giant fucking tricycle and then,

595
00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:33.590
and that and then if it gets lost,

596
00:32:33.591 --> 00:32:35.960
the grays and then he retires and he sells his act.

597
00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:39.050
It was brother Gallagher to Gallagher to goes out.

598
00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:42.020
He starts making a fortune and then gala gets jealous.
Goes,
wait a minute,

599
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:44.780
now I want my act back.
He's like,
no,
you sold it to me.

600
00:32:44.781 --> 00:32:48.080
And then they had to go to court and now Gallagher to can't do it anymore.

601
00:32:48.081 --> 00:32:50.090
So get the real Gallagher's back out there.

602
00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:52.930
<v 0>Yeah,
he,
he,
he told him to do it when he couldn't tell.</v>

603
00:32:52.931 --> 00:32:55.960
I think I've heard so many stories and then he told him to stop doing it.

604
00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:59.800
I just meant when that came,
when Gallagher too came to Boston,

605
00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:04.780
it was the funniest fucking thing cause like Gallagher to to the layman sounded

606
00:33:04.781 --> 00:33:09.100
like,
oh he wrote a new hour.
You know what I mean?
Like Ghostbusters,
Ghostbusters,

607
00:33:09.101 --> 00:33:11.320
part two,
Gallagher Gallagher part too.
Right.

608
00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:15.760
So he would go up there and it would be like,
it would,

609
00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:19.390
it wouldn't take any more than three or four minutes.
Like right out of the gate.

610
00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:23.160
It's like,
why does his voice sound so weird?
Cause he kind of looked like him.

611
00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:26.200
If you sat in the back and then people just start what within four minutes,
like,

612
00:33:26.201 --> 00:33:28.840
dude,
this isn't Gallagher.
Who the fuck is this?

613
00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:32.520
And then this murmur would start and he,
that fucking guy would,

614
00:33:32.521 --> 00:33:33.370
wouldn't even address it.

615
00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:35.830
And he would stay up there for an hour as people going like,

616
00:33:35.831 --> 00:33:39.730
who the fuck is this guy?
Um,
I only watched the first 10 minutes.

617
00:33:39.731 --> 00:33:42.700
I had to run out and go do a spot.
But the tension in the room,

618
00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:45.700
but that was back then where you could actually just do 40 member,

619
00:33:45.701 --> 00:33:49.290
45 was closing.
Just do 45 minutes.
Yeah.

620
00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:52.620
Somehow then it became like an hour.
I could still,

621
00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:57.310
I still do 45 a lot of times 45 on the road.
Sometimes I'm,
I'm just,

622
00:33:57.311 --> 00:34:00.040
I'm just going to do 45 yards,
like a club and they got a second.

623
00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:02.870
<v 2>Yeah.
Like a funny bone or something like that.
They've got a second show.</v>

624
00:34:02.871 --> 00:34:07.820
But even sometimes I just feel like doing 45 of 45 is great.
It's the best.
Yeah.

625
00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:11.130
Cause you look down and you got,
you're at 35 I got fucking 10 more.

626
00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:14.140
Not that I want to get off stage where all my God this is going good.
I'm good.

627
00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.090
<v 0>45 minutes to close it.</v>

628
00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:19.870
That's like having a beer in the afternoon and you got nothing to do for the

629
00:34:19.871 --> 00:34:20.920
rest of the fucking day.

630
00:34:20.921 --> 00:34:25.710
You know I'm jealous of his clean comics who get to like uh,

631
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:29.080
like I've heard Reagan we'll do like afternoon,
like a matinee show.

632
00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:33.310
And if I ever for some reason could find enough fucking animals to show up for a

633
00:34:33.311 --> 00:34:36.220
matinee show for me,
I would stop working at night.

634
00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:40.300
I would do a fucking two o'clock.
It's like in radio number.
Oop.

635
00:34:40.301 --> 00:34:43.270
You still always telling me about like doing how afternoon drive is like the

636
00:34:43.271 --> 00:34:47.290
greatest thing because you know you have a life like you can,

637
00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:49.270
if you still want to go out that night,
you can have,

638
00:34:49.271 --> 00:34:50.320
no matter how hard you hit it,

639
00:34:50.321 --> 00:34:53.860
you can sleep cause she's not back on the air until like noon or one or two

640
00:34:53.861 --> 00:34:55.930
o'clock in the afternoon.
But,
um,

641
00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:01.280
I dunno when I get old in my whole crowd turns into like the blue hairs,
uh,

642
00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:05.680
like I will have no fucking problem switching to being the man.

643
00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:07.570
I'll fucking do a,
I'll do an afternoon show.

644
00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:12.080
<v 2>I do a five o'clock or five o'clock and seven 30 easily.</v>

645
00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:15.470
People want to go out early in her.
All the comedy clubs have switched this time.

646
00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:16.550
So like seven o'clock,

647
00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:20.780
seven 30 on a Friday for a show at seven o'clock on a Saturday.

648
00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.220
You want to hate the most,
I hate seven and 10.
Oh yeah.

649
00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:27.680
So much time in between and me absolutely way too much time.

650
00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:31.070
So you get the goody goody showing up at 10 and then you get the fucking meth

651
00:35:31.071 --> 00:35:34.690
heads at seven,
then you get the meth heads at 10.
I always think like,

652
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:38.870
why can we just do seven and nine and nine just exactly.

653
00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:41.750
I'll do for my type 45 we get them in and get 'em out.

654
00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:43.110
Do you need me off so you can

655
00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:47.310
<v 0>turn this room over?
Now that pet peeve of mind,
now we can pitch a ball clubs.</v>

656
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:51.810
When the first show starts late,
it's like how did it start late?

657
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:53.011
You knew what to.

658
00:35:53.011 --> 00:35:55.770
I can see the second show starting late because you know somebody

659
00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:58.650
<v 2>build some drinks and shit.
This is the physical right out of the fucking game.</v>

660
00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:01.650
Yeah,
you don't want to,
you want to put yourself in a hole right off the bat.

661
00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:05.100
If it's seven o'clock there's no reason for it to start at seven 15 just started

662
00:36:05.101 --> 00:36:08.520
at seven the MC has got to take the bullet.
Oh,
I took the bullet.

663
00:36:08.521 --> 00:36:11.700
You took the bullet when your emcee and Sardis motherfuckers got to take it.

664
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.860
Does people still walking in there eating?
Sorry man.

665
00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:17.580
But you know these kids today,
they're all just say,
hey,
can we wait a minute?

666
00:36:17.581 --> 00:36:20.820
Cause I,
you know,
there's people still coming in.
I,
I always go,
yeah,
yeah.

667
00:36:20.821 --> 00:36:22.220
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
Right?

668
00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:25.310
<v 0>Oh my God.
The amount of fucking times.
That's the most amazing thing about that.</v>

669
00:36:25.311 --> 00:36:28.610
Richard Pryor special,
the one that he did down there with the terrorist theater.

670
00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.410
Then when he had the red shirt is he,

671
00:36:30.411 --> 00:36:33.440
when he came out there was still people getting in this seats.

672
00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:35.690
So anybody who's like a nerd for comedy,

673
00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:39.920
like that situation is every situation that an opener gets put in.

674
00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:45.050
He came out as a headliner on his own special dealt with that situation.

675
00:36:45.051 --> 00:36:49.490
They crushed.
I actually think,
you know,

676
00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:53.210
just being a nerd fan of his,
that that put them in the zone.

677
00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:57.010
Cause rather than going out and having to jump into a bit going,

678
00:36:57.020 --> 00:37:00.140
I am shooting a special and here's my first idea.

679
00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:05.380
He went out there and just fucking started riffing and like I think it just

680
00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:11.060
after that,
like that,
it's the greatest special of all time.

681
00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:15.880
And you don't think he had an opener that did time?
No,
he did.
What or who?
I also,

682
00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:18.410
we did,
he had a,
did he have a band?

683
00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:24.230
Um,
I used to know this right cause I remember,
uh,

684
00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:29.210
Eddie Murphy on delirious had the busboys from the movie 48 hours.

685
00:37:29.211 --> 00:37:33.710
He had them open,
uh,
who the fuck did he have?
I used to know this.

686
00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:39.030
It was like Gladys knight or something like that.
It was a singer.
Okay.

687
00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:42.690
And they sang and everybody fucking went out to the bathroom afterwards.

688
00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:48.270
And um,
they were like,
Richard is still coming back to the seats.

689
00:37:48.271 --> 00:37:49.860
He's like,
no,
I want to go out now.
I want to go on now.

690
00:37:49.861 --> 00:37:52.830
Like he just was failing it and they just sent him out there.

691
00:37:52.831 --> 00:37:56.820
And I think that the chaos of it was what he kind of thrived in.

692
00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:01.150
Um,
I dunno,
this is like some nerd shit,
but just this know that I've,

693
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:02.071
that I've read about him,

694
00:38:02.071 --> 00:38:04.310
like when he was in Vegas and everyone was sitting down,

695
00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:07.410
he supposed to wear clean and like thought that whole structure thing about that

696
00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:12.300
he had like a fucking meltdown.
But then you get a more in that the,
the,

697
00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:16.800
the little more chaos that was like,
like more of like his,

698
00:38:16.801 --> 00:38:19.010
his kids' comfort zone was kind of chaos in a way,

699
00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:22.260
it seems just from what I read,
man.
I don't know,
obviously never met the guy.

700
00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:23.810
I'm just saying.
Um,

701
00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:26.350
<v 2>the worst was that,
I'm sure you went through this,</v>

702
00:38:26.410 --> 00:38:30.970
remember when you could still smoke in the comedy clubs to first show Saturday

703
00:38:30.971 --> 00:38:33.850
was a no smoking show and they were always uptight.
Yeah,

704
00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:36.250
they were always a tight ass as weren't a good crowd.

705
00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.870
You knew if you just get through that show,

706
00:38:37.871 --> 00:38:40.660
the second show is going to be great cause they would have drinkers and smokers

707
00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:44.350
and they're fun people and they'll just laugh.
But the first ones are fucking,

708
00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:45.550
they want to be home early.

709
00:38:45.551 --> 00:38:48.340
They go out early and they don't want to put up with any smoke and they were

710
00:38:48.341 --> 00:38:50.710
always fucking tight.
It felt good job always

711
00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:53.910
<v 0>coming out to just get this done.
Let's go to the comedy show.
Yeah,</v>

712
00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:59.060
we'll be home by nine 30 I remember when when when they used to fucking like bye

713
00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:02.250
whole,
I don't know.
My first,
my first eight years of stand up,

714
00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:06.570
that would put me to 2000 right around 2000 they started to have the smoke free

715
00:39:06.571 --> 00:39:09.360
stuff.
Like I had actually had like a smoker's cough a little bit.

716
00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:13.950
I remember I would wake up the next morning back when I had hair and I would get

717
00:39:13.951 --> 00:39:16.020
in the shower and when the water would pour over me,

718
00:39:16.021 --> 00:39:17.490
all this smoke that was in my hair,

719
00:39:17.491 --> 00:39:20.250
I wish I would just breathe it in and it smelled like I fought a fire.

720
00:39:20.251 --> 00:39:24.570
So what I started doing was I,
and I noticed I was getting a cough.

721
00:39:24.571 --> 00:39:26.370
What I started doing was,
uh,

722
00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:30.930
I'd come home after the shows and I would immediately take a shower and that was

723
00:39:30.931 --> 00:39:33.600
just fucking throw my,
you know,
I was still living at home at the time,

724
00:39:33.601 --> 00:39:37.350
eight years.
I know when I was in New York by then,
but like the first,
um,

725
00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:39.330
three years when I was still living at home with my parents,

726
00:39:39.331 --> 00:39:43.140
like I would just throw the clothes right in the fucking hamper and all of that

727
00:39:43.141 --> 00:39:46.100
shit.
And a teeny maybe eyes would be like,
I'm going to being on stage.

728
00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:47.460
My eyes were like burning.

729
00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:49.950
<v 2>Yeah.
The funny bone and Saint Louis was always like,
it was,</v>

730
00:39:49.951 --> 00:39:52.020
it was like a smoke machine.
Like you were at a concert.

731
00:39:52.021 --> 00:39:54.480
It was like Motley Crue starting off,
you know,
shout at the devil.

732
00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:56.100
You couldn't see a foot in front of you.

733
00:39:56.190 --> 00:39:59.280
The whole fucking room smoked and you're like,
Holy Shit.

734
00:39:59.281 --> 00:40:03.340
And yet I do like the ratios on a Saturday.
I'm like,
this is brutal on my,
yeah.

735
00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:04.190
So do you,

736
00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:06.690
<v 0>do you now you finding with doing like stand up with,
uh,</v>

737
00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:08.140
cause when I went back to New York,

738
00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:10.450
I couldn't believe how many groans I was getting.

739
00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:13.750
Like I was getting a lot of groans in,
in,
um,

740
00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:16.570
or just like people like kind of look at each other,

741
00:40:16.571 --> 00:40:20.640
like what the fuck could just blows my mind that young people are like,
they,

742
00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:24.430
they act like old people in clubs now.
And I feel like they are,
they're like,

743
00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:29.890
I dunno like it,
cause they grew up on social media.
Like you just saying shit,

744
00:40:29.891 --> 00:40:32.380
like you're going to get in trouble.
How have you found,

745
00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:35.050
it seems like you think the New York scenes great.
Like I'm out of it.

746
00:40:35.051 --> 00:40:39.430
I just went back for a couple of days and I think I was a little weirded out by

747
00:40:39.431 --> 00:40:41.240
some of the,
uh,
the people there.

748
00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:44.410
Are you finding it that it's because you've been there,

749
00:40:44.411 --> 00:40:47.230
like you could sort of just because you're there every fucking night,

750
00:40:47.231 --> 00:40:48.320
like you don't notice a change?

751
00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:50.910
<v 2>Yeah,
I don't see,
I don't see a change in too much.
I mean,</v>

752
00:40:50.911 --> 00:40:52.650
I don't see a change in out here either.

753
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:55.020
When I do sets at the comedy store and Improv,

754
00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:58.200
I could pretty much do the same set.
I'm really feel it.
Um,

755
00:40:58.201 --> 00:40:59.550
I dunno where you did them,
but I,
you know,

756
00:40:59.551 --> 00:41:02.120
I know like a deer stand or New York comedy club,

757
00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:05.160
they just come in the laugh and there's not really,
no one's really gone,
man,

758
00:41:05.161 --> 00:41:07.860
that crowd sucks.
That's so uptight.
And so you're not,

759
00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:10.130
we're not getting that at all.
It was,

760
00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:13.240
<v 0>I live out here now,
so I'm comfortable,
comfortable out here.</v>

761
00:41:13.241 --> 00:41:15.190
So I feel like la crowds are better than New York,

762
00:41:15.191 --> 00:41:17.440
and it's just because I'm living out here and I'm just used to it.

763
00:41:17.441 --> 00:41:18.460
I think that that's what it is.

764
00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:22.570
<v 2>I always hated la crowds.
When I used to come out 10,
15 years ago,
I would,</v>

765
00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:26.650
you know,
like,
why is this guy so angry on stage?
I just didn't get it.

766
00:41:26.651 --> 00:41:29.860
You know what I mean?
I wasn't physical,
I wasn't smiling all the time and shit.

767
00:41:29.861 --> 00:41:32.680
I'm like,
man,
he's crowds a rough.
And then it turned,
I don't know,

768
00:41:32.681 --> 00:41:34.280
like maybe like seven,
eight years ago

769
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:38.300
<v 1>where just you could do whatever you want in the comics were dirty and edgy and</v>

770
00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:41.360
they laughed at laughed because the laugh factory for so long,

771
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:46.130
this is such a weird thing to say.
It was too happy a place.
It was too well lit,

772
00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:47.241
you know?

773
00:41:47.241 --> 00:41:50.330
And then I saw that thing in the background look like the Warner brothers.

774
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:54.200
Any and that's all folks just still take a big fucking cartoon.

775
00:41:54.201 --> 00:41:57.800
So I'd get in there and you could see the whole fucking Rome.

776
00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:00.770
And then I just got like self conscious when I would go on that stage being
like,

777
00:42:00.771 --> 00:42:05.510
just if you said anything fucked up.
But now I love the club.
Um,

778
00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:07.490
it definitely was,
I,
I,

779
00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:10.730
I tried to stay away from that club because I knew I never did well on there.

780
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:12.380
Do you think that like,
uh,

781
00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:16.250
there's gonna be a backlash to this,

782
00:42:16.251 --> 00:42:21.050
like a sort of like,
I dunno,

783
00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:24.920
cause I'm not saying everything that people get offended by is,

784
00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:29.240
is wrong because that's not accurate.
But um,

785
00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:31.970
the overreaction in this,
this like,

786
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.080
I'm Kinda thinking about every GI generation rebels against the other
generation.

787
00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:39.460
The previous,
I'm kinda thinking like the next group of,

788
00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:43.040
of young kids coming up.
I guess maybe it's wishful thinking.

789
00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:46.910
I'm hoping that they're going to be more like the people I knew in the seventies

790
00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:50.000
and eighties.
I don't think so because this generation,
the young ones now,

791
00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:53.780
they don't drink,
they don't do drugs.
They might smoke a little pot.

792
00:42:53.781 --> 00:42:55.010
They're not like promiscuous,

793
00:42:55.011 --> 00:42:58.070
like the last generation before that where they were,
you know,

794
00:42:58.071 --> 00:43:02.660
having sex early and getting no one 19 year old kids are not going in the woods

795
00:43:02.661 --> 00:43:04.370
and drinking.
You know what I mean?

796
00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:07.130
They're not getting high and not doing mushrooms like we did.

797
00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:10.760
I wish I was smoking pot at 12 years old.
I was drinking,
smoking cigarettes.

798
00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:13.730
When you would hide the beers you all excited like you still,

799
00:43:13.731 --> 00:43:16.340
everybody will be like,
hey,
just steal like three beers to me,
dad.

800
00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:19.370
I'll still three bubba and he put together like this,
this stash.

801
00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:22.250
And then you'd go and you'd bury him in the fucking woods.

802
00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:25.460
Remember when you would go out there and be so fucking cold that they froze,

803
00:43:25.461 --> 00:43:29.310
froze.
And then you'd have to fucking just sit there and just slowly sipping.

804
00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:31.670
Slowly said you wouldn't even be getting drunk interviews.

805
00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:34.700
Giant ice of fucking beer.
Um,

806
00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:38.450
or they get skunked if he left them out there too long,

807
00:43:38.451 --> 00:43:40.610
even it's every weekend was like,
you'd go to the woods,

808
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:44.420
you'd get as fucked up as you possibly could and then the cops would show up

809
00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:45.500
every fucking weekend,

810
00:43:45.501 --> 00:43:49.730
chase you out of there and everyone to leave it in their cars wasted.
I mean,

811
00:43:49.731 --> 00:43:54.230
there has to be a happy medium between that and what the fuck is going on.

812
00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:56.870
I like,
I'm talking about this like I know what kids are doing.

813
00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:01.130
They also doing like fucking ecstasy and meth and shit.
It is pretty nuts.
Yeah,

814
00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:05.470
but I,
I seriously like the,
they're not,
they're not out,

815
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:07.320
you know like drinking and stuff like that.

816
00:44:07.321 --> 00:44:10.000
I got a bunch of nieces and nephews and their friends and stuff like that.

817
00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:12.650
Seed and none of them doing anything.
Don't touch alcohol.

818
00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:15.310
They don't smoked and not even in the women.
Why would you dude,

819
00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:19.730
if there was a flat screen TV in your house,
you know,
and these kids,

820
00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:21.120
a lot of people got like a couple of them.

821
00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:24.600
This is like a fucking TV and like every major room in their house,

822
00:44:24.601 --> 00:44:29.040
you can go online,
talk to people,
play in video games.

823
00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:32.250
You can watch porn on your right on your phone.

824
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:34.790
<v 0>Yeah.
You can watch plane,
you watch a play thing.</v>

825
00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:37.260
The fucked up it is that you can just watch footage of a plane crashing.

826
00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:40.400
Nobody knew what the fuck that looked like and we will grown.

827
00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:41.243
He had to go like he,

828
00:44:41.330 --> 00:44:46.330
there was some war footage but you can just watch you literally see anything.

829
00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:50.310
What does it look like when a guy jumps off the building,
he hits the pavement.

830
00:44:50.311 --> 00:44:51.330
What does that look like?

831
00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:55.100
I don't know what that website is because I was never into the death shit.
Uh,

832
00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:59.940
but you know,
I remember some of the fucking comics I was came up with when,

833
00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:03.360
when all that Isis Shit,
when they was saw on people's fucking heads off,

834
00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:07.260
they would go on and watch it and then they would come in like,
Oh God,

835
00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:10.950
that was so fucked.
I was like,
why would you do that?
Like I actually know,

836
00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:14.790
like I did a bit one time about being on fire,

837
00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:18.660
screaming and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah blah.
And a buddy of mine,

838
00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:21.090
a comic I knew told me,
he goes,

839
00:45:21.091 --> 00:45:23.880
that's actually not the noise people make when they get burned to death.

840
00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:27.690
And he started imitating the noise.
It was even creepier.
And I'm like,

841
00:45:27.691 --> 00:45:30.060
how the fuck do you know that?
And he goes,
ah,
you know,

842
00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:33.090
I've watched some pretty dark shit.
It's like you fucking,

843
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:37.530
somebody got burned to death and you,
you sat and fucking watched it.

844
00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:38.650
I don't know.

845
00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:41.710
<v 2>I saw one isis beheading video.
My brother sent it to me and he's like,</v>

846
00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:44.380
don't worry,
it's not what it is.
It's a joke at the end.

847
00:45:44.381 --> 00:45:47.830
Just watch it through the end just to mess with him this fall and I,
and it was,

848
00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:49.533
it's still,

849
00:45:49.570 --> 00:45:52.540
that was like 15 years ago or 10 years or I still can't get out of my mind.

850
00:45:52.541 --> 00:45:53.980
I never watched that stuff.
Never.

851
00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:56.640
I don't want to want to see anybody get hit by a car on a lot.

852
00:45:56.641 --> 00:45:59.370
I want to see any of that shit.
They live.
Yeah,
they live.

853
00:45:59.710 --> 00:46:02.980
<v 0>It's just kind of why I like the happy medium if you can't handle the car is</v>

854
00:46:02.981 --> 00:46:06.340
somebody getting gored by a bull because it's literally like the only thing

855
00:46:06.341 --> 00:46:10.060
cartoon does not exaggerate is how high you go in the air when the ball hits
you.

856
00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:13.870
Dude,
I,
so I go,
oh fuck,
I don't have my phone.
I left my phone.
This guy fucking,

857
00:46:14.770 --> 00:46:17.800
this dude's running and he's,
he said,
you know what's fucking idiot?

858
00:46:17.801 --> 00:46:20.500
He's in the ring with a bunch of other guys with a bunch of bulls running around

859
00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:22.150
and he didn't have his head on the swivel.

860
00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:25.720
He gets fucking shot up in the air and the bolt takes off and the guy goes into

861
00:46:25.721 --> 00:46:28.570
like a fetal position and then everybody comes and saves him.

862
00:46:28.571 --> 00:46:32.350
And now he's running like looking back to see if the bulls come in.

863
00:46:32.351 --> 00:46:37.330
And as he's looking back,
another bull comes to the guy again.

864
00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:40.420
Yeah,
it was just like if he was an NFL player,
he's like,

865
00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:44.140
he was on special teams or some shit in his,
uh,
his career's going to be over.

866
00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:48.190
I do have to read a little bit of advertising here,
but um,
uh,

867
00:46:48.310 --> 00:46:51.530
I name you say how great it is to see I don't have,
I get to see.
And now that,
uh,

868
00:46:51.970 --> 00:46:55.720
I became a big phony out here in Hollywood.
You know,
when you've got a kid too,

869
00:46:55.721 --> 00:46:58.270
man,
it's a whole other,
yeah.
You know this,

870
00:46:58.271 --> 00:47:01.110
this weekend is my daughter's first birthday.

871
00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:05.800
First Birthday while I'm baking my first cake and my wife had invited all these

872
00:47:05.801 --> 00:47:08.260
people.
There's going to be all these kids there,
but we're going to have a cool,

873
00:47:08.261 --> 00:47:10.660
like it's like adult food,
right?
You know,

874
00:47:10.661 --> 00:47:12.970
if you want some whiskey as something like that,
whatever,
you know,

875
00:47:12.971 --> 00:47:16.450
if the other spouse is cool,
we'll let you drive.
It's fine.

876
00:47:16.451 --> 00:47:20.520
And then we got all this cool shit for the kids.
Our gift bag is,

877
00:47:20.890 --> 00:47:24.010
is like this fucking bag of like gummy bears and just,
I don't know,

878
00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:25.120
kids love gummy bears.
Right?

879
00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:29.020
<v 2>You know,
10 years ago you never thought you'd be baking a cake.
But my theory,</v>

880
00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:30.250
whenever

881
00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:31.840
<v 0>you think like,
I don't know if I could do this,</v>

882
00:47:31.841 --> 00:47:35.030
this is kind of what you do for the kid.
If there's a kid involved,

883
00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:39.580
do you get a pass?
Oh yeah,
no.
My,
my,
my wife said to me,
she's going like,

884
00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:41.680
I don't know,
it's going to be all these people because the recipe,

885
00:47:41.681 --> 00:47:45.420
I had this for like a,
like a two layer cake and they should go,

886
00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:47.500
may want to make it three.
And then she's just like,
well,
you know,

887
00:47:47.501 --> 00:47:50.260
you could just go to the grocery store and do the Dunkin Hines thing.

888
00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:52.780
And I was like,
no,
I'm not fucking doing that.
Right.
All right.

889
00:47:52.810 --> 00:47:54.070
I'm doing this every year.

890
00:47:54.071 --> 00:47:57.670
Like this is one of these things that you got to have on the,

891
00:47:57.730 --> 00:48:01.420
on the resume for like when your kid gets old to be like,
what kind of dad?

892
00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:04.540
What kind of Dad was my dad made me a cake every year.

893
00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:08.560
I gotta at least have that because I'm a fucking lunatic and I know I'm going to

894
00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:13.240
snap.
Well,
my son's got a little person to be around.
I'm an asshole so I,

895
00:48:13.241 --> 00:48:15.610
I at least got to come through with a cake.
Right?

896
00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:18.490
You have to document everything too because they don't believe you.

897
00:48:18.491 --> 00:48:20.170
That's the advice I got from other parents.

898
00:48:20.171 --> 00:48:23.020
Take pictures because they're not going to believe that you took them to

899
00:48:23.021 --> 00:48:26.110
Disneyland every year and all that and you did all the shit with them.

900
00:48:26.111 --> 00:48:30.280
So whenever I take my son anywhere,
an event,
I take a picture.
So I go,

901
00:48:30.281 --> 00:48:33.160
hey mother fucker,
this is what I did at five.
This is what I did at six.

902
00:48:33.161 --> 00:48:34.780
Look what I did.
Dan Marino told me that.

903
00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:38.050
Marino told me that one time cause you know we came out to Mike show and I

904
00:48:38.051 --> 00:48:40.380
didn't even get to see how you get to me and yeah,
I tell me he was,

905
00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:43.660
hey Dan Marino was out and I was in Fort Lauderdale.
I was like fuck,

906
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:47.500
I would love if he came back.
He's such a humble guy.
Oh he's great.
He's funny.

907
00:48:47.501 --> 00:48:50.920
He's awesome man.
I got,
Oh tell him what I've been wanting to tell him forever.

908
00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:54.070
I was like,
dude,
if you played today and your prime with these rules of coverage,

909
00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:58.780
you would throw for 6,000 yards without a problem every season.
And he's Ah man,

910
00:48:58.781 --> 00:49:00.520
I appreciate that.
I appreciate that.

911
00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:04.810
Now he knows he still loves to show off his arm.
He loves to just go,

912
00:49:04.811 --> 00:49:08.140
let me just show you.
When they do those rock and jock things on the Superbowl,

913
00:49:08.350 --> 00:49:12.640
those rappers,
you know like qtip or something and he's firing at him that

914
00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:18.010
he must've watched it.
Dan Marino,
football life,
phenomenal arm goes up,

915
00:49:18.011 --> 00:49:18.844
ball comes out.

916
00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:21.550
It still looked like when they were just showing him throwing the ball.

917
00:49:21.551 --> 00:49:25.360
It looked like they sped up the film.
It's like a,
it's like a fucking a viper.

918
00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:27.430
You can't even see it.

919
00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:31.300
It just fucking goes up on the burnout and it's a tight spiral.
Um,

920
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:35.050
that's funny.
Listen Motherfucker,
I took it here.
I took it here.

921
00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:36.400
You're going to say the towel?
Yeah.

922
00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:40.780
So just take document and take pictures the whole time.
We didn't do anything,

923
00:49:41.050 --> 00:49:42.800
dad.
I'm already worried that,
uh,

924
00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:46.990
when they go through that period where inevitably they hate you because that

925
00:49:47.010 --> 00:49:50.410
gets,
the kid gets to a point where they know enough shit that they think they're

926
00:49:50.411 --> 00:49:53.530
ready to live on their own.
That comes around like,
what?
11,
12,

927
00:49:53.531 --> 00:49:55.480
13 and then you just got,

928
00:49:56.330 --> 00:50:01.300
then you just gotta wait til they're like 26 I think.
And then they kind of like,

929
00:50:01.301 --> 00:50:04.440
oh,
wait a minute.
You know,
it's a rough,
so it seems like it's gonna be,

930
00:50:04.570 --> 00:50:07.250
that's a rugged,
rough 15 years.
Let me read this bullshit.

931
00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:13.140
Stop doing this doctor Phil.
Shit.
Alright.
Aw me undies.
Everybody owe me undies.

932

I opened you fucking first beer.
All right.

934
00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:23.740
[inaudible] you want to look good in your underwear and be comfortable,
right?

935
00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:28.280
But that perfect balance is hard to find down.
Sacrifice a comfort.

936
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:29.570
Why would you do that?

937
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:34.340
Talk about why me undies is the best underwear you will ever own.
Well,

it's got a superhero vibe too.
It's always feel a little stronger when I wear it.

942
00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:52.130
Does that contractually fill my obligation?
There?

943
00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:55.310
Myan will be the most comfortable pair of underwear you will ever own.

944
00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:59.540
Made from sustainably sourced natural soft fabric that is three times softer

945
00:50:59.541 --> 00:51:03.680

Ultimate feel good undies for what you want to feel.

let's wrap this up.

974
00:52:30.051 --> 00:52:34.610
I want to get Jim Florentine Florentine Florentine Florentines,

975
00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:40.070
um,
NFL picks for this weekend.
Patriots.
Jags you already picked the pats.

976
00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:42.890
Now let's talk about the eagles and the Vikings.

977
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:45.880
Two teams that have never won a Superbowl.

978
00:52:45.890 --> 00:52:50.000
Neither the Jaguar three out of 14 said,
not won a super bowl.

979
00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:52.290
<v 1>That's a tough one.
This is going to be,
you know,
cause uh,</v>

980
00:52:52.530 --> 00:52:56.050
two backup quarterbacks in there.
Um,
Minnesota has got a good deal.

981
00:52:56.070 --> 00:53:00.570
You don't know what nick falls is going to show up,
right?
Um,

982
00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:03.710
I'm going to go,
I'm going to go Philly,
you're going to go fill it.

983
00:53:03.730 --> 00:53:06.060
I'm going to go fully at home feeling at home.
Fucking yeah.

984
00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:09.330
Ends all that excitement in Minnesota.
Yeah,
I think so.

985
00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:13.290
And the city of brotherly should have lost that New Orleans game.

986
00:53:13.350 --> 00:53:14.260
They should have,
you know,

987
00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:19.470
lose it and then New Orleans fucked the whole thing up.
So yeah,

988
00:53:20.570 --> 00:53:21.403
I just

989
00:53:22.530 --> 00:53:25.710
imagine if you are a die hard saints fan

990
00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:29.460
<v 0>and that happened,
it would be like,
that would literally be like if you fucking,</v>

991
00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:33.570
if you did a fucking standup special,

992
00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:36.180
you had the greatest special of all fucking time.

993
00:53:36.181 --> 00:53:38.800
And then right at the end of your special,
you went to put the mic on,

994
00:53:38.801 --> 00:53:41.490
the mic stand is somehow you did like a fucking face plant.

995
00:53:42.330 --> 00:53:43.650
I'm trying to think like what you could do,

996
00:53:43.651 --> 00:53:48.390
like you did it or maybe there was no audio.
Oh you have to do is wave.
No,

997
00:53:48.391 --> 00:53:52.320
but you'd have to go and somehow you,
you fucked up.
Are you okay?
Yeah,

998
00:53:54.090 --> 00:53:56.010
no.
In the end you just go,
I like fucking kids.

999
00:53:56.120 --> 00:54:01.010
He would take your dick out and start jerking off.
Maybe it's not that that,
yeah.

1000
00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:05.340
So I think,
yeah,
the eagles maybe a field goal though when it went to a,

1001
00:54:05.490 --> 00:54:10.020
and there'll be Philly and patriots and patriots,
you know.
Okay.

1002
00:54:10.050 --> 00:54:12.390
31 20 something like that.
And like that,

1003
00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:15.340
I'm hoping the Patriots win and Abrasive.

1004
00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:18.960
Mine didn't just look at the quarterbacks.
So that's what you got to do with how,

1005
00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:23.490
who has a better defense eagles or a vikings?
The Vikings,

1006
00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:28.170
I kind of want the vikings are on the road.
They got a better defense and then,

1007
00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:31.230
you know,
they got a backup,
but he's their guy at this point.
Yeah.

1008
00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:34.980
Case Kanombe that's what's making me feel old now is the names of quarterback

1009
00:54:34.981 --> 00:54:38.340
case Carson.
It's just like our generation's gone.
There's no,
there's no,

1010
00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:42.210
Jim says no bills.
No,
not anymore.
There's no Steve,
you remember Steve?
No.

1011
00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:45.590
Steve de Burgh anymore.
Steve de Birds Marino.

1012
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:50.640
You know Steve Young,
you only like I left is like Jay,
uh,

1013
00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:55.850
your Yo Guy Jake.
Oh,
Jay Cutler.
Yeah.
Shakes.
Not In my field.
Goal kickers.
Cody.

1014
00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:59.130
I,
I've never,
there was never a Cody on the dolphins to last year.

1015
00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:03.790
Oh,
they love to see names that,
oh,
everybody born in the 90.

1016
00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:06.420
[inaudible] seem to have like a,
see David started with Clemens?
Oh no,

1017
00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:10.320
he named everything with a k.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
the Cody,
but like it was that.

1018
00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:12.360
All right,
so you pick it up.
I'm going to say,

1019
00:55:13.350 --> 00:55:18.330
I'm hoping the Patriots win and then I have no idea.
Oh,

1020
00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:19.440
such a fucking hard one.

1021
00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:22.410
I would actually say the vikings go in and break the eagles heart,

1022
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:25.380
but the football gods smiled on him last week.

1023
00:55:26.010 --> 00:55:28.260
Am I going to go against the Vikings again this week?

1024
00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:31.800
I can't do that because then if they win,

1025
00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:34.980
I'll have to go against them again if the Patriots win and there'll be chinks in

1026
00:55:34.981 --> 00:55:36.870
my own team.
So do I pick enough?
Fuck that.

1027
00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:38.400
And I don't think there's going to be a,

1028
00:55:38.401 --> 00:55:41.490
a big home field advantage of the vikings going into soup bowl.

1029
00:55:41.490 --> 00:55:44.310
A lot of those are corporate tickets and it doesn't,

1030
00:55:44.410 --> 00:55:48.780
the Patriots can play anywhere,
so it doesn't matter.
Right.
I think,
uh,

1031
00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:54.690
that's a tough one.
That's the game.
Viking sequences a game.

1032
00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:59.580
That's going to be a good one.
I I.
E.
I'm going to say vikings.
I'll pick.

1033
00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:04.470
No,
you took the eagles.
I'll take the vikings.
Fuck it.
I'll take the vikings.
Yeah.

1034
00:56:04.530 --> 00:56:08.790
I just think the old nick falls is going to show up.
Old Nick full shows up.

1035
00:56:10.590 --> 00:56:14.010
But both of those fucking teams,
both those franchises to football,

1036
00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:17.010
God's love to fucking Yank the rug out from underneath.
I know.

1037
00:56:18.570 --> 00:56:23.440
I think there's a chance to stadium I collapsed on the both teams.
Either way.

1038
00:56:23.441 --> 00:56:25.510
It's going to be great,
Jim.
So great to see it.

1039
00:56:25.511 --> 00:56:27.790
