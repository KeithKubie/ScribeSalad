00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:14.310
very dear to my heart is brought
to you by the Centro Primo Levi

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.780

center that does great,

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.370

suspicion of undefined hostility

Why are we here today?

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:30.100
We're here in tribute to Primo
Levi, the Italian scientist

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:33.860
and Auschwitz survivor who became
an exemplary voice of conscious,

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:38.910 position:56%
really one of the first to bring to
a wider audience the reality of life

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:42.290
within the logger, as he
termed the death camps.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:46.430
Levi was an incredibly complex man,
a type of intellectual character

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:49.000
that we rarely encounter today.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.320 position:56%
Intensely literate in literary, his
curiosity equally aroused by science

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:59.330 position:56%
and the natural world as by behavior
and the nature of good and evil.

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:02.210
He wrote short stories,
science fiction, poetry.

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:03.960
He edited dramatic
versions of his work

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.300
for theatrical productions
on stage and radio.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.470
And he began by writing
what he called "plain

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:14.600
or disguised autobiography", about
his experiences in Auschwitz.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.820
And now, thanks to the prodigious
efforts of one of our panelist,

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.100
Ann Goldstein of the New Yorker,
we have the complete works

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:24.070
of Primo Levi, which is the
occasion for this discussion.

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:26.610
It is a collection
of every known work

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:30.330
that Primo Levi wrote now
translated into English.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.210
It includes the most
well-known words,

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:35.070
as well as Levi's private
collection of writings.

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:39.690
In total, the collection spans
three volumes and 3000 pages.

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:41.190 position:56%
How many times did you read it, Ann?

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:42.490
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Quite a number.

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:45.730
But I just want to insert that
I was not the only translator.

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:47.030
This was a great team.

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:49.350
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: We--
Yes, we're going to get to that.

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:55.770
And there are roughly 3000 pages,
200 essays, columns, forwards,

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:58.720
inscription reviews,
works of fiction, poems,

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.100
and each have their articles.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.230
Tracing is evolution
from a narrative writer

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:05.000
to a more analytical writer
at the end of his life.

Welcome, Adam.

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:17.420
And I'd like to about translation
but I first would like to start

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:20.770
with Primo Livo himself, the man,
which is why we're here, and like,

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:24.230
both of you just take a crack at
why he's such a significant figure

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:29.580
in the 20th century literature not
just as a holocaust writer but also

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:34.370
as someone who spoke to
larger issues in literature.

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:36.540
Anne, why don't you start?

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.370
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Well,
of course my--

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:42.630 position:56%
I'm a partisan of Primo Levi because
I spent a lot of time with him.

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:50.920
But I think that he does
have this voice of sort of,

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:55.580
of calmness in the midst
of a lot of uncalmness.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:59.640
I mean he has a very-- in
spite of the terrible things

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:06.290
that he often describes, he's got a
very-- a quiet and, superficially,

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:11.270
I would say dispassionate view of
that-- of what he's talking about.

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:15.450 position:56%
Underneath it, I think there's a lot
of passion, actually, that you find.

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:18.220
But I think that's one
of the things that he--

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:24.150
that he's so amazingly does,
and that-- that's rare I think.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:25.450
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: Adam?

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:26.750
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: Yeah.

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:28.050
I agree entirely with Ann.

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:30.710
But what-- the way I
would think about it is

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:34.610
that Levi was a scientist, and
that was core to what he did.

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:37.640
Of all of his books, my
favorite is "The Periodic Table".

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.940
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Yeah.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.240
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: Which
is an attempt to sort

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.100
of rewrite his personal
history in terms

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:46.470
of the elements of
the periodic table.

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:49.890
And there's something, I think,
that combination of a scientist,

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:54.170
and this isn't exactly the right
word, the dispassionate survey

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:59.270
of experience combined with
his, for lack of a better word,

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:01.840
he's an old-fashioned one,
his humanity at all times,

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.360
and the way those two things
were always intentioned.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:10.740
He's witnessed, as a humanist
and his dry, often ironic,

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:14.500
usually mordant, always
dispassionate voice

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:19.040
as a scientific observer of human
experience and human quality.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.590
I think it's the way those two
things are constantly intention

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:26.770
on his work that makes him not
just a witness but a great author.

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:28.070
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: Right.

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:32.970 position:56%
So this project, Ann, I think it
took maybe 10 years to put together.

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:34.270
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Maybe more.

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:35.570
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: Maybe more?

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:36.870
But can you--

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:38.170
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Yes.

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:39.470

us a little bit about the origins

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:40.770

the project came together

but also what kind of
attracted you to Primo Levi.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.330
You've translated many
other writers--

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:46.630
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Yeah.

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:48.080
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: -- but
what attracted you to Primo Levi?

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.490
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Well,
the project began with--

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:53.130
it was the idea of Robert
Weil, an editor at Norton--

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:55.990
or what is now Liveright,
a part of Norton.

00:13:55.990 --> 00:14:00.010
And he had put together a volume of
the collected works of Isaac Babel.

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:03.880
And he had been-- he had loved
Primo Levi for many years.

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:07.220
I mean been-- felt Primo
Levi was great and compelling

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:10.240 position:56%
and important writer, and he got the
idea that he would the same thing

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.070
for Primo Levi, not realizing

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:15.240
that it was a rather
different-sized task.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:19.240
Primo Levi's work has been
translated into English

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.990 position:56%
in a very sort of haphazard fashion.

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:24.100
His important books had
all been translated.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:27.720
This is a man, the truth
of the periodic table.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.960
But a lot of his-- he wrote
a lot of short stories,

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.260
as you mentioned, and essays.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.330
And those had been published
in English in, as I say,

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:39.040
sort of haphazard piecemeal fashion
in different collections, you know,

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.530 position:56%
three from this book, four from this
book put together into a volume.

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:44.690
And they were not done in the
way that Levi had wanted to.

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:51.230
So when Bob Weil started, when he--
he had this idea, then he asked me

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:56.950
if I would be interested in
come joining him in this idea,

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:59.070
we realized that this was the case.

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:01.540
We hadn't really realized it,
so that it was a much bigger job

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:07.060 position:56%
to collect-- to put the-- all the
books back in their original format.

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:10.710
And then we saw that some things--

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:13.110
there were things that hadn't
been translated, there were a lot

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:16.860
of essays and stories that
haven't even been collected at all.

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:20.770
So then we decided to do
this big project which was

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:24.920
to retranslate everything, put
it in the order in which it had--

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.850
in the-- in chronologic order.

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:29.250
We put all the books together the
way they were originally published

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:33.510
following the Italian
collected works.

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:35.290
So that's what happened.

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:38.340
But Bob first spent about five
years getting the English rights

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:41.350
which were scattered all over the
place in many different places.

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:42.650
So that took some time.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:43.960
And then I joined in 2004.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.400
And then we spent 11
years, I would say.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.700
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: But the--

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.000
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: And then--

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.300
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz:
But the individual books,

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:51.600
they can't be sold
separately, you have to--

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.140
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: No, you
have to buy the whole package.

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:54.440
But it's a deal.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:57.260
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: It's a fabulous
bargain, everybody is doing it.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.890
And if I may just quickly say,
because he's not my editor,

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:02.240
so I have no commercial
allegiance to him.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:05.440 position:56%
Bob Weil is one of those rare people
who's left, in American publishing,

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.150
who actually has this
passionate connection.

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:09.450
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Two books.

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:10.750
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: Two books.

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:12.050
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: Right.

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:13.350
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: Two books.

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:14.650
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Yeah.

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:15.950
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: And it's not
the type that's supposed to--

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:17.250
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Yeah.

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:18.550
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: --
survive, but he does

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:19.850
and he feels hugely passionate--

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:21.150
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Yeah.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:22.450
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: -- about
making literature live.

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:23.750
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Yeah.

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.050
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: So--

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:26.350
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: And then
I would just say that--

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:27.650
so when we realize
the scope of the--

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:28.950
of this as a translation project,
we needed a few more translators,

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:30.250
one of whom is here
today, Michael Moore.

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:32.860
And-- So there were, I always
forget the exact number,

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:36.920
but there were I think 10
or 11 translators plus me.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.740
So it was a big project.

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:41.980 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: And Anne, is there a
uniform edition of Levi in Italian?

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:43.730
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Yes, there is.

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:48.680 position:56%
There's a two-volume, which I think
is about to be three volumes, right?

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.490
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: So--
I'm going to bring Alessandro--

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:52.790
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Yeah.

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:54.090
No, it's OK.

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:55.390
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: So Levi is

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:57.360
such as a meticulous,
careful writer.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:02.460
What were the special challenges
that you faced, or you and team,

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:07.470
shall we say, in bringing from
the Italian to the English?

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:08.770
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: You
know, there's some--

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:10.800
I mean his sentences are complex.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.440
I mean-- I keep doing this.

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.740
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: You're fine.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:16.040
You're find just--

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:19.890
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: His sentences
are complex, his ideas are complex,

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:22.440
but he is also a very clear writer.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.620
So-- But to make-- to balance that,

00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:28.030
to get that into English proper
is sometimes the challenge.

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:29.840
He uses a lot of scientific terms.

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.140
Those are always difficult.

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:34.460
He has-- His descriptions are
very-- often very detailed.

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:36.440
And those can be difficult.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.570 position:56%
So those are some of the challenges,

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:43.650
I mean apart from just the
regular challenges of translation.

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:44.950
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: Right.

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:47.560
Adam, you've written in
the past about translation.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:51.590
What is your sense of the project
here in terms of what's impressive

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:55.140
from the point of view of
a translation perspective?

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.230
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: Well, I have the
huge advantage of not being able

00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:00.460
to read Italian, so I
can opine on the virtues

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:04.000
of this translation
with special authority.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.060
But about a year ago, I guess
it was, I wrote a long piece

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:11.780
about the nature of translation.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:15.510
So I don't know if anybody saw,
but that's-- it was published in--

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:18.300 position:56%
first in French and then in English,
a thing called the "Dictionary

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:21.750
of Untranslatables" which was
a kind of huge encyclopedia

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:25.280
of all the terms that could not
be translated from one language

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.880
to another, although, in fact,

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.420
this book had been very
successfully translated from French

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.560
into English using
all of these things.

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:36.970
So-- And in truth, what the point
in the book really was, is that,

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:41.830
there are particular terms in words
and vocabulary in every language

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:45.550
that is ultimately
translatable but delicate

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:47.510
and fragile in transmission.

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:50.910
And I suspect-- the thing that
struck me, right, reading it,

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:53.080
and I know there's no
answer to this question--

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.380
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Yeah.

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:56.500
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: Levi's tone, at
least as I read it in English,

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.870
is often dryly ironic
in complicated ways.

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:03.610
That he usually is, and
we just saw it in the--

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:04.910
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Yeah.

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:06.210
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: -- in the film.

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:07.510
That's his way--

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:08.810
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Yeah,
sort of his--

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:10.110
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: -- in
addressing the world.

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:11.410
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Yeah.

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:12.710
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: Kind of
caustic understatement.

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:15.340
Is-- And English tends not to
lend itself as easily to that?

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:16.640 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Yeah, that's true.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.540
So, I mean, I think sometimes,
probably, things are more--

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:23.840
are less fine than they might
have been in the original.

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:27.540
But as a translator, you
can only do what you can do.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:29.550
But we, you know, I
mean, we, you know, I--

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:31.660
the translators I went
back and forth with,

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:35.660
all the translators many times
on their books, I mean, you know,

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:37.200
we discuss a lot of things.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:40.560
We had the help of the Primo
Levi Center in New York

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.810
and the Primo Levi Center in Turin.

00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:46.870
So I think that in the end,
of course as a translator,

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:50.930
one of your greatest-- or
should I say nightmares

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:52.370
of second guessing yourself.

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:55.980
But my hope is that
we got to something

00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:01.550
that is less-- that
is pretty accurate.

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:05.930
And not-- But not, but
not dry, I mean not--

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:07.230
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: Literal.

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:08.530
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein:-- literal,
not literal, mind you.

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:09.830
Anyway, I didn't really
answer your question but--

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:11.830
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: You
know, that is the answer,

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:13.350
is that there is no rule.

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:14.650
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: There's no rule.

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:15.950
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: There's a--

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:17.250
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: No.

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:19.840
I mean there's that famous Italian
expression "traduttore, traditore",

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.580
every translator is a betrayer.

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:25.210
So, what can you do when
you're up against that.

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:27.820
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: I don't--
We have a limited amount of time.

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:29.120
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: I'm sorry.

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.420
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: I want to
talk a little bit-- No, it's OK.

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:32.210
I would like to talk about
Primo Levi as a writer.

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:34.780
You know, one of the things
that I find interesting is his

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:39.680
"If This Is a Man" was really one
of the first survivor's memoir,

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.850
I think, first published in 1947.

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:46.360
And it took another 12 years, I
believe, before it's published

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:50.580 position:56%
in the 50s in the United States, and
I think it was arguably really not

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.430
until the mid-80s,
shortly before his death,

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:55.510
that it really became
recognized especially in America

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:58.650
as this gigantic literary figure.

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:03.400
And I'm really curious, for both of
you, you know, was there a reason

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:08.720
that it took so long for Levi to be
really recognized in the way it had

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.020
to do with him as a writer,

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:13.580
it had to do with the holocaust is
a phenomenon and the initial kind

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:17.500
of unwillingness to grapple
with the kind of, you know,

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.590
really the horribleness
of the whole episode.

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:22.130
I don't know, Ann, if you
have any thoughts about that.

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:23.940
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Well, I mean I
think that's one of the reasons

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:29.420
that he wasn't known--
well-known in America anyway.

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:32.070
But the book that made
him famous in America was

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:35.950
"The Periodic Table" was
not the holocaust memoirs.

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:39.440
But, I mean interestingly, the
"If This Is A Man", his first book

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:43.550
which was about his fear in
Auschwitz was originally published

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:45.260
as "Survival In Auschwitz".

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:46.560
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: Absolutely.

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:47.860
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: And at that time,

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:52.660 position:56%
I mean because people were beginning
to, I think, sort of be interested

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:55.030
in or aware of the holocaust, I
mean, I think right after the war,

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:57.950
nobody want to think
about it in Italy or here.

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:02.390 position:56%
But then at that-- when it was first
published in English, that was--

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:05.330
"Auschwitz" was a term that
was-- would attract attention,

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:09.430 position:56%
and then the idea of survival had to
be something positive in America--

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:10.730
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: Right.

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:12.030
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: -- anyway.

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:13.330
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: Yes,
it's an upbeat story--

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:14.630
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Upbeat
story, right, exactly.

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:15.930
But I don't know, what
do you, you know--

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:17.230
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: Well, you
know, I think is, you know,

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:18.530
and I know study closely, Michael.

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:20.990
One of the fascinating
things about the storiography

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:24.500
of the holocaust is, the long
delay, and people understanding.

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.890
It is still startling
thing when you look

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:30.110
at the literature, the
atrocity literature.

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:33.630
That it's literature about
Nazi atrocities after the war,

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:35.590
everything gets kind
of mixed together.

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:40.580
And sort of the most famous film
of the immediate post-war is the

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:41.880
"Dock Out" [assumed
spelling], right,

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:44.580
which was a horrific place
but not distinguished.

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:47.660
Their death camps were not
distinguished clearly at all

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:52.670
from concentrations camps and
from the rest of the lager system.

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:55.560
And so, I think that it
took some clarification.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:59.310
I think it's not an accident that
"The Periodic Table" is the book

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:02.360
that kind of tipped him
over in a certain way,

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:06.200
exactly because Levi seemed
to be a postmodernist.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.100
He seem to belong with Aborjez

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:11.610
or Cortis [assumed spelling]
or someone like that.

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:16.610
Because the organization of that
book was so highly literary with--

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:19.790
was at such a high level
of artifice that it--

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:24.490
unlike say, Elie Wiesel's
testimony which tended

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:30.250
to have a much more direct, you
could give to eighth grade class

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:33.670
and they would understand
the material.

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:37.950
And Levi-- even in, it seems to me,
in the-- in his Auschwitz memoir,

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:42.160
is writing with a literary
self-consciousness that's quite

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.870
remarkable amongst in all of the--

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:45.170
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Yeah.

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:46.470
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: -- in all of
the literature of survival,

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:47.770
and all of the literature
of the holocaust.

00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:49.900
And I think that book
made it more difficult.

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:53.200
But ultimately, when it came-- he
came round again as a writer rather

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.010
than as a witness, and I think
that's one of the reasons why his--

00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:58.460
he seems to occupy a larger place.

00:23:58.460 --> 00:23:59.760
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: Let--

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.060
You know, you actually touched
on something that I am curious

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:03.690
about especially thinking
about ElieWiesel a lot

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:05.980
over the last several months
with his recent death.

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:10.670
You know, he was arguably much
more embraced in the United States

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:12.740
than Primo Levi initially.

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:17.970
And I'm just kind of curious if you
think there is a reason for that.

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:20.100
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Well, you
sort of touched on it really.

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:21.400
I mean--

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.700
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: Yes.

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:24.000
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: --
he's-- you said why.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.780
No. I mean I think he--
it was more direct.

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:31.830
You know, he was sort of more--
a more direct witness, I guess--

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:33.130
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: Right.

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:36.350
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: And I say this with
no-- without any invidiousness.

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:37.650
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: Sure.

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:39.480
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: He dramatized
his role as a survivor in a way

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.920
that you only have to watch Levi.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.800
He's one of the most beautiful
faces I think in the 20th century

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:48.570
in the combination of
sensitivity and intelligence.

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:53.620
And that's a very different kind of
address that the one that Wiesel,

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:56.410
to his credit and without--

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:59.540
essentially popular address
that Wiesel offered and kind

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:03.420
of popular witness and going around
and being with heads of state

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:07.760
and playing that particular kind
of role, nothing wrong about it,

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:10.340
but it's not the role
Levi chose to play at all.

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:12.720
To my mind, I don't
know if you'd agree, I--

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:16.950
the two best essays in English
about Primo Levi are both

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:20.620
by Clive James [inaudible]
colleague of ours at The New Yorker

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:22.680
who often writes about
Italian literature.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:28.290 position:56%
And he talks about Levi I think with
insight and a kind of brilliance

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:33.140
that I recommend to anybody
who's curious about Levi's work.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:37.350 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: You know, one
thing I was curious about, I was--

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:40.120
I did not read the all 3000
pages but a couple of books.

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:44.830
But at the, you know, at the end
of "The Drowned and the Saved",

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:50.530 position:56%
his last published work, Levi had
some very powerful words, I thought.

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:53.750
He said quote-- He
wrote, "It happened once

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:55.980
and it could happen again.

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.230
This is at the heart
of what I have to say."

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:00.320
And so, this is the
mid-80s that he's writing.

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:04.230
And he goes on to describe what
he terms as a precursory signs

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:07.810
that are appearing in 1980s, you
know, things he thought, I think,

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:11.040
might be precursors to
maybe not another holocaust

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.280
but the mass atrocities perhaps.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.920
He talked about violence,
governmental lawlessness,

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:18.190
intolerance, political fanaticism.

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:23.700 position:56%
Then he wrote, "We need to sharpen
our sense and distrust the prophets,

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:27.080
the charismatics, the persons
who speak and write fancy words

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:29.780
without the backing
of sound reasons."

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:32.580
It's very--

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:33.880
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Yell.

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.180
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz:
So I'm really kind

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:39.740
of curious whether you think
Levi, from having, you know,

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:43.160
read the totality of works, whether
you saw Auschwitz as an aberration,

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.690
something unprecedented,
not to be repeated,

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:46.990
or do you think he was writing

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:49.880
with maybe a more preventative,
you know, warning--

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:51.180
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: No, I--

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:52.480
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: -- the
world of what could happen?

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.780
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: I think he was.

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:55.080
I mean he definitely thought
it could happen again.

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.380
I mean that it wasn't--

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:57.680
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: I think that--

00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:58.980
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Yeah.

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.280
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: --
that's one of the things.

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:01.580
That's what's moving in his work
and is very much part of his--

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:02.880
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Yeah.

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.180
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: -- his testimony
as an Italian Jew, is that,

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:05.480
it all happens insidiously.

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:06.780
That's one of the things that--

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.080
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Right.

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.380
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: --
that occurs, right?

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:12.110
It goes from a kind of O Fish
[assumed spelling] pantomime

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:16.320
of power into something--
into a sinister alliance,

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:19.180 position:56%
and that every point along away, you
feel that you're protected from it

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:21.370
because it doesn't
affect you directly.

00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:24.400
And then finally, it
turns to sending someone

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:27.330
who doesn't need self-identify
as a Jew obviously,

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:30.910
but is not whose primary
identity is not as a Jew

00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:34.480
but his primary identity is
as a scientist, and Italian,

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:37.640
a humanist finds himself
in the death camp.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:41.730
And so, I think that is the
recurrent, in the certain sense,

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:46.450
you might almost say, it seems to
me at least that Levi assumes that,

00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:49.530
in a certain sense, fascism is
the default condition of mankind.

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:53.640
That it's always that those
pathogens are always present

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.940
and they're always possible.

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:58.580
They're not aberration
that needs to be explained,

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:02.020
they're the permanent
risk that we have

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:04.600
to immunize ourselves
against perpetually.

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:10.910
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: When he
talks about the sense of shame,

00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:12.930
for example, that the
survivors felt,

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:14.460
he says one of the reasons is--

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:18.790
for that is that it was men who
made Auschwitz and we were all men.

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:22.290
So I think that he's talking
about the fact, what you--

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:23.590
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: Yeah.

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:25.190
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: -- of
it's always being possible.

00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:26.760
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: You know,
one of the things that Levi wrote

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:29.500
about is what he described
as the gray zone.

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:32.030
You know, this was a scale that
he created to challenge kind

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:37.190
of the oversimplification of kind
of the division of the people there

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:39.660
and to victims, bystanders,
perpetuators.

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:43.540
And he didn't-- he, by
acknowledging, you know,

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:47.120
even though his own moral and
ethical compromises which lead

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:48.960
to collaboration with the Nazis.

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:52.830
And he did not, as I said,
exempt himself from the scale.

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:57.830
And he felt guilty for having
survived and for the advantages

00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:59.630 position:56%
that he received compared to others.

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:01.720
And I'm just kind of curious, as
you look through the entirety,

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:04.390
how much of this kind of
self-criticism and willingness

00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:08.530
to kind of look on functionally as
its self is a hallmark of his work?

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:10.270
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: I
think definitely, yeah.

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:12.240
I think he's definitely
would be looking

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:14.650
at himself all the time in a way.

00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:18.410
I mean I think he's-- he's
not a-- he doesn't really--

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:21.830
he doesn't let himself
off the hook ever really.

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:28.050
I think he's very-- I mean many
of his works are autobiographical.

00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:33.220
And even the ones that aren't have
a little hint of autobiography.

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:36.380
Well, all writers, of course,
are always writing themselves.

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:39.030
But, no. But I mean
he as a particular--

00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:42.810
I mean when he's writing about
science, he's writing about many--

00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:45.510
in many ways, he's
writing about himself.

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:48.290
Examining-- This isn't
exactly answering your question

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:51.350
but I mean he does--
I think he does--

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:55.970
he is constantly judging
himself in some way.

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:57.270
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: Yeah.

00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:58.570
I think Anne is exactly right.

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:00.420
I think one of the things that
drive us to them is that his--

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:04.090
the nature of his kind of moral
inquiry is unsparing about himself.

00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:06.230
And I'm talking about
the gray zones.

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:09.450
I think what he has
in mind is, is that,

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:12.800
we don't have the luxury
of simply being victims.

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:16.200
In any extreme human
situation, what you find--

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.580
this is a trivial version
of the same thing, right,

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:23.050 position:56%
relatively trivial version, but it's
something that's make a television

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:25.810
series like "Orange Is The
New Black" so intriguing is

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:29.970
that the unique division of the
imprisoned and the prisoners.

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:33.440
Those who are in prison and
those who are imprisoned breaks

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:35.760
down in the actual reality of it.

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:40.050 position:56%
And though he has no moral ambiguity
about who's good and who's bad,

00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:44.500
nonetheless, human behavior is
complex and not melodramatic.

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:45.800
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Yeah.

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.550
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: He's the
least melodramatic poet

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:50.990
of the most melodramatic
possible situations, and that's,

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:52.610
I think, part of what makes him--

00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:53.910
&gt;&gt; Alessandro Cassin: Absolutely.

00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:58.000
I think that Adam just explained
very well one of touched on,

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.320 position:56%
one of the major differences
between him and Elie Wiesel in terms

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:08.110
of Elie Wiesel identifying with
victim and Levi refusing this role

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:11.700
of a victim or complicating
it at least.

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:13.700
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: Forgive,
I just introduced-- I was--

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:16.070
a little bit later but
you're Alessandro Cassin

00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:17.370
from the Primo Levi Center.

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:18.670
No, please.

00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:19.970
Do you want to add anything else--

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:21.270
&gt;&gt; Alessandro Cassin: No, no.

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:22.570
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz:
-- to the conversation?

00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:23.870
OK. I'm going to give you a
chance before we go to questions.

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:25.170
And you-- the audience should
be thinking of questions.

00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:26.530
I think we have a few
more minutes of discussion

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:28.360
and then we'll open it up.

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:32.780
Just to stay on this idea
of the self-criticism,

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.780
do you think that Levi
thought of writing it all

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:40.360
as a therapeutic thing for himself
or is that maybe a little bit of--

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:41.660
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Little modern--

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:42.960
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz:
Little modernist.

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.260
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Little modern.

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:45.560
I don't know.

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:46.860
I mean I don't think so.

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:48.160
I mean he wrote because
he wanted to--

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.460
he had something that
he wanted to say.

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:55.370
I mean originally he wanted to-- he
felt that it was crucial to report

00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:58.080
on what he had seen at Auschwitz.

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.590
And I think that was
the origin, really.

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:03.960
I mean he talks about the-- I
mean he talks a lot about writing

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:08.490
and about words, about the
importance of language,

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:12.330
and I think all those things are
really why he wanted, why he wrote.

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:14.240
I don't think it was-- I
don't think he thought of it

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.000
as therapeutic necessarily--

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.300
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: Right.

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:18.600
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: -- at all.

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:19.900
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: You
know, one of the things

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:21.280
that is also interesting to me

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:25.800
about Levi is he does not
absolve the German people even

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:30.930
after the holocaust has
ended, and not just the Nazis

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:33.590
but the entire German population.

00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:36.740
Again quoting from the-- at the
end of "The Drowned and the Saved".

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:39.270
You know, "From the beginning,
out of mental laziness,

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:42.240
near-sighted calculations,
stupidity and national pride.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:44.940
They accepted the fancy
words of 'Corporal Hitler'.

00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:46.360
Followed him as long
as he was blessed

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:47.850
by faith and a lack [inaudible].

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:52.680 position:56%
We're devastated by this downfall,
ravaged by grief, misery and remorse

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.180
and rehabilitated a few years later

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:56.570
but unprincipled political
gamesmanship."

00:32:56.570 --> 00:33:00.430
So he wasn't really
buying the idea, I think,

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:04.190 position:56%
that Germany had been rehabilitated.

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:07.530
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: I think that
the catastrophe what we now call

00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:08.830
the holocaust--

00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:10.130
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: Right.

00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:12.550
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: -- of the Second
World War more broadly, it was,

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:15.310
for him, a catastrophe
of European civilization.

00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:18.230
It wasn't just the
Germans were responsible,

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:20.140
though obviously they were.

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:22.430
It was that all of
European civilization

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:25.310
and it's most basic premises,
that's at least how I read them,

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:28.920
had been not only undermined
but in certain-- well, he says--

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:31.020
he said it in what we were
watching a moment ago.

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:34.670
Europe, an idea of Europe, an
idea of European civilization came

00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:37.710
to an end at Auschwitz,
and how do we construct it,

00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:39.680
how to rebuild it after that.

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:42.290
That's one of the things
that makes him so powerful,

00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:44.310
and it's one of the things--
again, this is one of the themes

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:46.900
that I know Clive James
for instance takes up,

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:49.250
that makes his own
personal trajectory,

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:53.590
his own biography compelling
and significant.

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:56.850
You know, did he take his own life.

00:33:56.850 --> 00:34:01.850
That's a question that means a
great deal to us because it touches

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:06.950
on our sense of is there any
expiation, is there any recompense

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:10.410
in bearing witness even as he do.

00:34:10.410 --> 00:34:14.430
And I think it's one of the big
questions that his work presents.

00:34:14.430 --> 00:34:15.730
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz:
Well, before we--

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:20.260 position:56%
before I turn it over to Allesandro,
I did want to ask, as I've said,

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:23.010
there's many books, there's
dozens of articles in a year.

00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:27.020
I just be curious from Ann,
what are some of the [inaudible]

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:31.790
in here that-- I mean obviously
we know the most famous

00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:36.100 position:56%
of the Levi works but, you know,
for a person just dipping into this,

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:38.520
what are the two or three
kind of things that kind

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:39.980
of surprised you in there.

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:42.100
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Well, there's
a collection of stories called

00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:48.350
"Lilith" which has some great
stories, wonderful stories in it.

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:52.120
And then the other book that I
think is also really interesting is

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:56.640
"Other People's Trades"
which is a lot of essay

00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:59.380
which on a huge range of topics.

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:02.160
So those-- I mean there's a
lot in there to keep you busy.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:07.230 position:56%
And I think the science fiction
stories also are really interesting,

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:11.780
some better than others but
they're very-- they're good.

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:15.680
You don't expect them,
I think, from Levi.

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:16.980
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz:
Is the later Levi--

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:18.280
How much different is
he than the earlier Levi

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:20.440
or is there a consistency
through those--

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:21.740
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: I think there's--

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:23.040
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: -- 40 years?

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.340
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: So I
think they're pretty--

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:25.640
there's a pretty solid consistency.

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:28.950
I mean maybe his writing
becomes more writerly [phonetic]

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:30.970
in a way but it's all--

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:32.440
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz:
The tone seems very--

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:33.740
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Yeah, exactly.

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:35.040
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz:
The voice seems to be--

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:37.100
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Yeah, it seems
very-- Yeah, I think it's the same.

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:38.400
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: OK.

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.740
So we're-- I'm grateful
to have Alessandro

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:42.200
from the Primo Levi
Center, and maybe--

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.500
&gt;&gt; Alessandro Cassin: Thank you.

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:44.800
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: -- you
might want to say a few words

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.380
about Primo Levi and this book--

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:47.680
&gt;&gt; Alessandro Cassin:
Yes, thank you.

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:48.980
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz:
-- conversation.

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:50.280
&gt;&gt; Alessandro Cassin: Absolutely.

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:53.460 position:56%
I'd like to thank, first of all,
The Library of Congress, [inaudible]

00:35:53.460 --> 00:36:00.090
and the speakers and the moderator
for a very stimulating discussion.

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:04.100
I'd like to spend just a few
words, really the main mission

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:10.050
of Primo Levi which is to
usher the humanistic legacy

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:12.740
of Primo Levi into the future.

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:18.440 position:56%
By legacy, I mean the fundamental
ethical questions raised by his work

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:22.660
and his far-reaching
analysis of human nature.

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:25.000
I'll get back to this in a minute.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.470
You know, during the past few
months, as all of you know,

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:33.070
many critics and writers have
expressed themselves so eloquently

00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:35.760
and the cultural importance

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:39.860
of Liveright's complete
works of Primo Levi.

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:46.040 position:56%
For me, with an additional
personal important dimension to this

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:51.900
as my father Orion Press
published the first edition

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:55.150
"If This Is A Man"
in English in 1959.

00:36:55.150 --> 00:37:01.160
And so, for me, this event is also
a sort of a closing of a circle.

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:07.640 position:56%
I'd like-- Anne Goldstein can attest
to the challenging-- challenges--

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:11.970 position:56%
the many challenges and complexities
of translating Primo Levi.

00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:16.240 position:56%
I think what's equally
challenging is to understand the way

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:21.690
that Primo Levi became such as
a towering public intellectual,

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:28.250
really a moral compass for post-war
Italy and for our present world.

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:34.980
In this edition, this
edition contributes to this

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:37.410
by including a number
of articles and essays

00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:40.590
in which Primo Levi
directly addresses

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:43.220
and observes the world
that he lived in.

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:48.500
I think by doing this, he
provides us a lens through which,

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:53.720
to better understand and analyze
the ambitions and pitfalls

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:56.010
of modern societies in general.

00:37:56.010 --> 00:38:01.650
Way beyond the holocaust,
this is really what he does.

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:04.580
Primo Levi was a man
of the 20th century.

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:09.100
His-- The arch of his life really
spans from the end of World War I

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:16.570
to the years immediately leading
to the fall of the Berlin Wall.

00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:18.410
Endlessly curious and inquisitive,

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:23.430
Levi had the rare gift
of a true observer.

00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:28.880 position:56%
I think the depth of his vision made
him one of the great commentators

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:32.650
of our times, but back
to his legacy.

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:34.990
When I talk about the
legacy of his work,

00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:39.920 position:56%
I'm referring to his lucid
observations of the human conditions

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:45.010
as seen in some of the most
extreme imaginable circumstances.

00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:50.270
And the cleared eye analysis of
a relationship of the powerful

00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:55.070
with the powerless and then
really the necessary connection

00:38:55.070 --> 00:39:00.010
between the world of
science and the humanities.

00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:04.220
So for the past 15 years,
spearheaded by our director,

00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:11.870 position:56%
Natalia Indrimi, Primo Levi Center
has, you know, has promoted the bait

00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:16.970
around the work around Primo
Levi, and the broader history

00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:19.360
of the Jewish precedence
in Italy really.

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:23.830
Many of our activities derived
directly from the questions

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:29.860 position:56%
that Primo Levi raised, which led
to public programs and universities,

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:34.000
museums, and more recently,
the United Nations.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.250
But what interests us
today is really the future,

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:41.510
how do we bring Primo
Levi to the 21st century.

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:45.130
Our answer is really through books.

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:50.580
So next to the Primo Levi's
own words, his complete works,

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:56.550
we started a small publishing
company, CPL Editions,

00:39:56.550 --> 00:40:02.200
with a grown library titles, the
first 10 of which are available

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.710
for you to browser here later.

00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:07.890
And it's been a privilege
to conceive a series

00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:11.670
for the American audience from
whom the world of Primo Levi,

00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:18.040 position:56%
the world of Italian Jews, is really
something quite remote, even exotic.

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:22.860
So the goal of CPL Edition is
to create this wider context

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:26.180
for the work Primo
Levi, following his lead

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:29.470
in exploring the relationship
between history

00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:32.500
and memory in our society.

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:36.330
I'd like to conclude with
saying that, you know,

00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:39.500
when you talk about Primo
Levi's legacy, inevitably,

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:44.610 position:56%
you're confronting with these large
words, large concepts of categories.

00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:46.350
But what I would like to
leave you with a sense

00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:48.410
of that Primo Levi
really brought all of this

00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:50.830
down to a very personal issue.

00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:53.680
He makes everything
extremely personal.

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:58.020
So far from moralizing
or ever being normative,

00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:01.210
I think that Primo
Levi really teaches how

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:04.290
to ask poignant questions.

00:41:04.290 --> 00:41:05.590
Thank you.

00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:07.390
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz:
Thank you, Alessandro.

00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:12.340
[ Applause ]

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:14.730
So I would like to open
it up to questions.

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:20.270 position:56%
There are microphones in the aisles,

00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:24.440
and please come up
and ask a question.

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:25.740
&gt;&gt; OK.

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:28.920
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz:
Go ahead, sir.

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:33.970
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to ask Anne
and Alessandro especially

00:41:33.970 --> 00:41:38.640
about an impression I had from a
couple of different things I read

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:42.370 position:56%
of Primo Levi and the movie "Truce".

00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:45.710
And that is-- I just
found it very powerful.

00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:50.550
I don't know what it
signifies to you, that when--

00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:53.970
and I think about this in
terms of the suicide as well.

00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:55.600
Or I guess it's controversial,

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:58.010
whether it's a suicide,
not a suicide.

00:41:58.010 --> 00:42:01.650
That when he returns to
his apartment in Turin,

00:42:01.650 --> 00:42:07.500
after all his experience, it
feels like nothing has changed

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.820
from the point of view of
the residence and so forth,

00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:13.420
it's as if it was in
suspended animation.

00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:15.370
And he comes back.

00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:19.370
And from the point of view of the
people around him, you were gone,

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:20.880
you know, now you're back.

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:25.990
Is that a false impression
or is that no, doesn't mean.

00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:27.290
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Well, yes.

00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:31.480
I mean it was-- I think that
was sort of the root of his need

00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:34.300 position:56%
to recount what had happened to him.

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:38.030
That this was something-- I
mean, I guess you could say it--

00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:40.680
put it that way, that it was--
everything else was the same

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:43.440
but of course it wasn't because
there haven't been a war.

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:45.430
I mean-- And everybody
had suffered in that war.

00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:49.330
But I think that was certainly
coming back to Turin was, you know,

00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:53.190
was part of the end to
this sort of normal life

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:55.300
or it wasn't really normal life.

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:57.850
&gt;&gt; Alessandro Cassin: I think most
importantly, he went back to--

00:42:57.850 --> 00:43:00.670
in Italy, had been
devastated by the war.

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:05.930
It was not longer Jewish life
in Europe as they were before.

00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:08.340
So the consequences
of this are gigantic.

00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:09.860
The world that he came back

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:14.040
to really did not resemble
the Italy that he left.

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:16.930
I think that he went through, I
don't know, this transformation,

00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:22.510
but what he found was a transformed
Italy, Turin and Europe really.

00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:34.150
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:38.720
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: Just to repeat to
everyone here the point being made

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:40.520
that is over there--
they've got a mic.

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:42.150
&gt;&gt; I mean he came to Italy.

00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:46.400
He came back to a country that
had 20 years of dictatorship

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:49.760
that after the war had no
acknowledgements whatsoever,

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.060
we begin now.

00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:55.470 position:56%
In 1988, the racial laws were
acknowledged the Italian government.

00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:56.770
&gt;&gt; Alessandro Cassin: Yes.

00:43:56.770 --> 00:44:01.040
Italy had not the equivalent
of Nuremberg trials ever.

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.340
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: Yes sir.

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:04.280
&gt;&gt; Thank you for a
great presentation.

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:08.000
I have a question about
Primo Levi's children.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.900
You don't really hear about them.

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:11.200
I was just wondering.

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:12.500
Maybe Ann Goldstein
would know about this.

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:14.550
What were-- What was
their involvement in this?

00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:19.140
I get that he has a son and
daughter Renzo and Lisa, I think.

00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:21.170 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Well, they
weren't really part of this project.

00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:22.720
I mean they are there.

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:27.520 position:56%
I mean they-- of course, without
them, I guess none of it can happen.

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:32.040
But we weren't directly
involved with them.

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:33.340
&gt;&gt; OK.

00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:34.640
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: OK.

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:35.940
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: Yes.

00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:37.240
Hi, Lisa.

00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:38.540 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Hi. I was just wondering what
Primo Levi's reputation is in Italy.

00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:42.820
Like how has the Italian's
society, culture, government kind

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:44.770
of viewed him over the
years because, of course,

00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:49.600
I'm sure he's been critical
of those previous before.

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:50.900
&gt;&gt; Alessandro Cassin: Yes.

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:52.200
Well, it's a complicated story.

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:55.480 position:56%
You know, they mentioned a bit
about the first edition of his work.

00:44:55.480 --> 00:45:01.520
It took awhile for Italians
acknowledge Primo Levi is something

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:05.460
more than a witness of a show.

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:07.070
Eventually, this happened.

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:11.640 position:56%
And I think the most significant
event in this process of recognizing

00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:14.650
as major voice and
writer were two things.

00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:19.150
One was that there were
school editions of his works,

00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:22.860
his two first books
particularly, so that teachers

00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:27.070
and students really
incorporate his work

00:45:27.070 --> 00:45:31.120
in the curriculum of
the Italian schools.

00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:38.740
The second major event was the
work of Marco Belpoliti a critique

00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:46.180
who was the first person to really
highlight a literary valuable work

00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:47.750
beyond the testimony.

00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:49.050
So it took a long time.

00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:50.350
It took a relatively long time.

00:45:50.350 --> 00:45:53.450
But starting, it's really from
the late '50s, early '60s,

00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:59.780 position:56%
his reputation has grown steadily
and became very, very important now.

00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:02.310
As I was mentioning
before, he also by writing

00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:05.180
in the stamp of-- daily from Turin.

00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:11.020
He became a major voice,
a moral compass.

00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:13.140
So what happened would
be major events

00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:17.830
from the nuclear disaster
[inaudible],

00:46:17.830 --> 00:46:23.570
conflicts in the Middle East,
terrorist activity in the '70s

00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:28.330
in Italy, people would turn
to him as a moral guide.

00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:32.030
So in addition to his
literary reputation,

00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:35.440
he really became a person to look--

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:38.110
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: Yes,
I've often thought in a--

00:46:38.110 --> 00:46:39.940 position:56%
though in a slightly earlier period,

00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:43.330
that his role must have been
very much like Albert Camus' role

00:46:43.330 --> 00:46:45.850
in France in 1940s and 1960s.

00:46:45.850 --> 00:46:47.150
&gt;&gt; Alessandro Cassin:
Yes, with differences.

00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:48.450
But yes, those are very good--

00:46:48.450 --> 00:46:50.770
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: And both working
as journalists, as well as--

00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:52.070
&gt;&gt; Alessandro Cassin: Right.

00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:53.370
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: --
working as [inaudible].

00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:54.670
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: The
one thing that's fascinating

00:46:54.670 --> 00:46:56.680
about this period is, of course,
is he was working fulltime as a--

00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:57.980
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: Chemist.

00:46:57.980 --> 00:46:59.280
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Chemist.

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:00.580
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz:
-- as a chemist.

00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:01.880
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Right.

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:03.180
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz:
That is at the business.

00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:06.030
So his writing was done I guess
in the morning or at night.

00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:07.350
So, over there.

00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:11.910
&gt;&gt; The garden of the
[inaudible] about the plight

00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:14.910
of Italian Jews under fascism.

00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:21.660
I was thinking about the contrast
in Germany, though the [inaudible]

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:27.750 position:56%
of anti-Semitism there, most German
Jewish intellectuals were profoundly

00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:31.150
wedded to German culture of Garte

00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:32.960
and Schiller [assumed
spelling] and so forth.

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:36.050
And I was wondering about Italy.

00:47:36.050 --> 00:47:41.260
Do the Italian Jews generally
and specifically Primo Levi,

00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:46.240 position:56%
did they have that same attachment
to Italian culture and civilization?

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:48.250
&gt;&gt; Alessandro Cassin: Yes.

00:47:48.250 --> 00:47:52.370
I would say absolutely yes.

00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:57.230
Bassani [assumed spelling] as
Primo Levi were really anchored

00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:59.490
to Italian literary tradition.

00:47:59.490 --> 00:48:03.830
I think that if you read Levi's
carefully, you really Danta,

00:48:03.830 --> 00:48:08.810
you find Manzuni, you find
a number of Italian writers

00:48:08.810 --> 00:48:12.110
who influenced them
in a very major way.

00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:15.190
And I think from the
unification of Italy,

00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:17.840
Italians felt very loyal
to the Italian state.

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:22.030
And in this, they incorporated, you
know, Italian culture in general.

00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:24.990
But yes. The question is yes.

00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:26.290
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: Yes, ma'am.

00:48:26.290 --> 00:48:27.590
&gt;&gt; This question is for Ann.

00:48:27.590 --> 00:48:31.720
I've read both Primo Levi and
Elena Ferrante in Italian.

00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:33.330
My Italian is not that good,
but I've struggled through it,

00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:35.880 position:56%
and then I read in your translation.

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:39.170 position:56%
So I was wondering if you could talk
a little bit about the challenges

00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:42.680
of translating because Primo
Levi uses a lot of Hebrew

00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:43.980
or Yiddish terms, and then--

00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:45.280
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: No.

00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:46.580
He doesn't.

00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:47.880
I mean he doesn't use.

00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:49.180
I mean Yiddish is sort of--

00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:50.480
&gt;&gt; I guess in "Lilith" [assumed
spelling] anyway I read that--

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:51.780
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: I'm sorry?

00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:53.080
&gt;&gt; In "Lilith" he used--
it was the--

00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:55.580
well, anyway, maybe you
could talk a little bit some

00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:59.780
of the challenges of
translation and that.

00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:02.360
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Well, I mean I
touched on some of them earlier.

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:07.400
But, yeah, I mean, Levi does
use a lot of scientific terms.

00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:10.770 position:56%
He also, another thing that he does,
is he uses a lot of unusual words.

00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:12.480
He even makes up words.

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:14.780
So those are challenging.

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:18.350
And it's challenging, for example,
when he uses a scientific word

00:49:18.350 --> 00:49:22.790
or an unusual word that
challenges to make it seem

00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:24.850
as though the word is not that--

00:49:24.850 --> 00:49:26.820
in English, it's not
just a bad translation,

00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:28.810
but it's actually an unusual word.

00:49:28.810 --> 00:49:31.260
So that's sort of a particular--

00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:33.350
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: Can I
ask you a question, Ann?

00:49:33.350 --> 00:49:34.650
And in all the years
we've worked together,

00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:36.000
I don't think I've ever asked.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.500
And that is you become
the premier translator

00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:41.200
of Italian into English with--

00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:42.500
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Right.

00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:43.800
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: -- Ferrante
and Levi and many other things.

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:45.100
What made you fall in love?

00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:46.740
You're not of Italian background--

00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:48.040
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: No.

00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:49.340
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: -- at all.

00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:50.640
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Not at all.

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:51.940
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: What made you fall
in love with the Italian language?

00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:53.240
I think Dante.

00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:54.540
I think I just-- I completely
fell in love Dante in,

00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:55.840
I don't know, college or something.

00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:58.580
And I was desperate to
read Dante in Italian.

00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:02.650
And that was the beginning
of my love of Italian.

00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:03.950
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz:
So how old were you

00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:06.650
when you started reading Italian
or start studying Italian?

00:50:06.650 --> 00:50:08.610
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Well,
long after college.

00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:12.620
I didn't learn Italian until I
was well into my 30's actually.

00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:15.440
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: This is
particularly asking-on question,

00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:16.770
but it comes to mind.

00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:20.120
And so-- But Italians
runs more fluent--

00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:22.310
more fluidly from 14th century

00:50:22.310 --> 00:50:23.950
to the present day
than English say would.

00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:25.760
Because if you could read, you
know, if you're reading things in--

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:27.060
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Well, yeah.

00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:28.360
I think-- Well, I don't know.

00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:32.050
I mean, I-- my previous
languages were Latin and French

00:50:32.050 --> 00:50:35.970
and I think was a great
basis for my Dante Italian.

00:50:35.970 --> 00:50:37.690
And then, you know, I mean, I--

00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:41.300
my studying of Italian was a little
bit irregular, so I don't really--

00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:43.410
I'm not sure if I can really
even answer that question.

00:50:43.410 --> 00:50:46.480
But yes, I didn't find it hard
to go from one to the next.

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:48.760
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: Yes, sir.

00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:51.870
&gt;&gt; Do you think Levi
committed suicide

00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:59.420
and if he did commit suicide
what should his readers think

00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:01.630
about that act?

00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:05.420
Was it just a personal
things of his or--

00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:06.720
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Yeah.

00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:08.020
I mean I think he did
commit suicide.

00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:11.350
But I think that the
reasons are very complex.

00:51:11.350 --> 00:51:13.930
They weren't-- It wasn't--
Was it Elie Wiesel who said--

00:51:13.930 --> 00:51:15.230
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: Yes.

00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:16.530
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: -- Auschwitz
finally caught up with him.

00:51:16.530 --> 00:51:17.830
I think that was--

00:51:17.830 --> 00:51:19.130
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz:
Forty years later.

00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:20.430
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Yeah, 40 years
later, I think that was sort

00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:21.860
of a very superficial
reading of it--

00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:26.520
&gt;&gt; Yes. This was a very-- also
opportunistic really but--

00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:27.860
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Yeah, but, well--

00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:33.370
&gt;&gt; I think that I don't think
one can enter the mind of someone

00:51:33.370 --> 00:51:38.660
who is abandon life
however we abandon it.

00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:42.290
And I think that to read
retrospectively the work

00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:48.980 position:56%
and the commitment of an entire life
based on a step that can, you know,

00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:53.480
can be made for-- and
can be taken on the--

00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:57.940
in a moment for many different
reasons, that he was sick

00:51:57.940 --> 00:52:00.260
or he was going through
a very difficult time,

00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:06.540
I mean is really not something
fair to-- and is unfortunate,

00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:09.220
something that many American
intellectuals beginning

00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:13.350
with Wiesel have found
convenient to use.

00:52:13.350 --> 00:52:16.610
And that's really not fair
thing especially in the face

00:52:16.610 --> 00:52:23.120
of a lifetime work such as
the one that Levi left us.

00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:25.290
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: Might I add
something to that if I might?

00:52:25.290 --> 00:52:30.130
That, you know, that it's certainly
a cheap caricature of Levi's life

00:52:30.130 --> 00:52:32.160
and of his end to turn it

00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:35.020
into Auschwitz caught
up with him finally.

00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:36.520
You know, despaired.

00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:40.450 position:56%
In other words, his eloquent witness
was in someway ultimately false

00:52:40.450 --> 00:52:42.360
because even Primo Levi--

00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:43.660
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Right.

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:44.960
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: --
took his own life.

00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:47.310
That's clearly a parody
of his circumstance.

00:52:47.310 --> 00:52:50.890
But in a broader sense, I do think
that the question of suicide,

00:52:50.890 --> 00:52:54.170
why go on living is a central
one in European literature,

00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:56.880
in Camus again and in Levi.

00:52:56.880 --> 00:53:01.810 position:56%
And so thinking about his biography,
in reverse, in a certain way,

00:53:01.810 --> 00:53:05.420
that is, his persistence in
writing, in bearing witness,

00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:09.270
in pursuing a life as a chemist,
as a writer, all of those things,

00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:12.030
isn't cheapened by our
knowledge of his end.

00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:13.330
I don't think we--

00:53:13.330 --> 00:53:14.630
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: No.

00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:15.930
&gt;&gt; Of course--

00:53:15.930 --> 00:53:17.230
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: No, absolutely.

00:53:17.230 --> 00:53:18.530
&gt;&gt; -- the work that takes a toll
and the work Primo Levi did.

00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:19.830
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: Yeah.

00:53:19.830 --> 00:53:21.130
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Yeah.

00:53:21.130 --> 00:53:22.580
&gt;&gt; Unveiling and revealing what
had happened in Italy, in Europe

00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:26.220
and not taking the
position, "OK, I'm the victim,

00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:30.010
those are the perpetrators,
and it'll never again."

00:53:30.010 --> 00:53:32.940
He took the position saying,
we're all human beings--

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:34.240
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: Right.

00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:38.910
&gt;&gt; -- and anyone of us can nurture
and it bring to fruition those--

00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:40.750
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: He
walked a moral tightrope

00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:42.550
for 40 years so that if he--

00:53:42.550 --> 00:53:45.210
[ Multiple Speaker ]

00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:48.350
&gt;&gt; And so he didn't
have anything to sell

00:53:48.350 --> 00:53:51.390
that would be easily
circulatible [phonetic].

00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:55.090
So it's a-- which was very
different from building--

00:53:55.090 --> 00:53:56.390
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: OK.

00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:57.690
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: No uplift.

00:53:57.690 --> 00:53:59.250 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: So I think we
have just a couple of more minutes.

00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:00.550
I see two questions there.

00:54:00.550 --> 00:54:03.840
Why don't you both ask the
question and then we'll wrap it up.

00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:05.140
Go ahead.

00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:09.340
&gt;&gt; My first question-- Well, my
only question, was do you believe

00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:14.920 position:56%
that Primo Levi wrote these books so
he could teach us a lesson of trying

00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:19.190
to repeat our mistakes in the past?

00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:20.870
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein:I don't think
Primo Levi would ever have thought

00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:23.620
that he was teaching
anybody a lesson, but--

00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:27.530
although he was very
interested in talking to--

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:31.760
in talking to children
and in visiting schools.

00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:36.150
But I think that-- I
guess that's the lesson.

00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:38.040
&gt;&gt; Levi wanted to understand how--

00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:40.070
[ Multiple Speaker ]

00:54:40.070 --> 00:54:41.370
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: Yes.

00:54:41.370 --> 00:54:43.010
&gt;&gt; -- society in which
we have certain rights

00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:47.870
in freedoms can be
dismantled, this you wanted.

00:54:47.870 --> 00:54:49.170
&gt;&gt; Did you have a question, sir?

00:54:49.170 --> 00:54:54.090 position:56%
&gt;&gt; If I may follow up on that
point, Primo Levi is a hero of mine,

00:54:54.090 --> 00:54:58.820
kind of personal professional
mentor in this fashion.

00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:03.710 position:56%
He seems to be one of the few people
who have taken on, as you said,

00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:09.610
that existential issue of
Europe ended at Auschwitz.

00:55:09.610 --> 00:55:12.120 position:56%
The civilization ended at Auschwitz,

00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:14.530
that one full statement
you made earlier.

00:55:14.530 --> 00:55:18.790
Given the Nazis' belief
that the Jews

00:55:18.790 --> 00:55:24.170
and Judaism undermine the
natural race, conflict

00:55:24.170 --> 00:55:27.480
and racial progression
that they believed in,

00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:32.600
Primo Levi to me seems-- as a
person who really speaks to that

00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:34.760
and challenges that in a deep way.

00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:38.030
However, I'm not adequate to
really understand how he does

00:55:38.030 --> 00:55:40.820
that effectively, he
does that for me.

00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:45.600
Could you comment on that?

00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:48.050
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: If I'm--
What I would say about it is,

00:55:48.050 --> 00:55:49.830
and it's something that
came up very clearly even

00:55:49.830 --> 00:55:53.120
in the little film we saw a moment
ago and it's stomatic in all

00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:57.130
of Levi's work is that
the pathogens of fascism,

00:55:57.130 --> 00:56:00.100
what happened in his view
are sort of omnipresent.

00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:05.660
These-- They're talking about them
being around in the '80s in Italy

00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:09.470
and that his view is, is that,
we make a mistake if we see it

00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:14.290
as a German aberration or
if we understand it as a--

00:56:14.290 --> 00:56:18.430
one particular is of
one historical period

00:56:18.430 --> 00:56:22.640
that we can escape and
look back on safely.

00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:26.110
That we're forever in ways that
Americans should be thinking

00:56:26.110 --> 00:56:31.300
about very hard at this moment,
that the pathogens of exclusion,

00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:35.080
the pathogens of racism, the
pathogens of indifference,

00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:38.360
pathogens of indifference
to what's going on around us

00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:41.390
because we choose not to
see, it's actually threat

00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:45.480
and it's actual consequences
that those are omnipresent

00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:48.460
and permanent parts of
the human condition.

00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:52.510
And ones that we ignore
at our enormous peril.

00:56:52.510 --> 00:56:57.240
[ Applause ]

00:56:57.240 --> 00:57:00.580
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: Ann,
you want any final words?

00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:01.880
&gt;&gt; Ann Goldstein: No, it's OK.

00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:03.180
&gt;&gt; Michael Abramowitz: OK.

00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:04.480
So thank you all for joining us.

00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:05.780
Thank you the Primo Levi Center.

00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:07.080
Thank you the Library of Congress.

00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:10.720
I did want to say that Adam
is signing books at 2:30

00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:12.870
and Ann is signing books at 1:30.

00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:16.980
I don't think you require
to actually buy the book.

00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:18.640
&gt;&gt; Adam Gopnic: You
should buy the book.

00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:19.940

Levi, "The Complete Works

a very good medicine

00:57:32.890 --> 00:57:35.780
against the pathogens
we were describing.
