00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.990
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.000
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: I'm Anne McLean

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.480
from the library's
Music Division,

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.450
and with me are Annette
Reisinger and Matthias Diener

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.500
from the terrific
Minguet Quartett.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.090
We're really pleased to welcome
them for their first appearance

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.700
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.000
[applause]

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.300
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: Thank you.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.740
Thank you.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.400
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: And as
you'll find out tonight

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.450
in just a moment, the
Minguet is admired

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.060
for beautifully intimate,
expressive playing

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.940
and also an adventurous pursuit
of a huge range of repertoire

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.470
that takes in unknown
masters from the past

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.210
and masters from today.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.300
And we'll be talking a
little bit about some

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.060
of those composers that you're
performing and recording,

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.460
some that I didn't know.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.750
Heinrich Herzogenberg is one.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.060
Unusual. Glenn Gould.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.680
They recorded a work by Glenn
Gould, the pianist, last year.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.240
They worked with Wolfgang
Rihm over a decade

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.130
to record the complete quartets

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.540
and also recorded his
fascinating piece "Et Lux"

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.420
with the excellent
Huelgas Ensemble.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.090
It's an incredible piece.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.110
And January, they'll be
performing Ginastera quartets

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.080
at the Elbphilharmonie, so that
gives you just a little bit

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.380
of a picture.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.370
Tonight, we look
forward to your beautiful

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.020
and interesting program
highlighting the wonderful Czech

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.490
repertoire with works
by [inaudible],

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.170
whom I did not know, Suk,
[inaudible], and Dvorak,

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.240
plus a Mahler arrangement
by you.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.850
So that's a whole
subject in itself --

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.740
the many threads that
connect great Czech composers

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.600
and great quartets.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.650
So first, I wanted to
ask you about the name

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.340
of your group, the Minguet.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.280
I know something about this,
and I'm fascinated by the man

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.580
for whom you're named.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.880
Tell us about him.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.180
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: Yeah.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.500
Actually, he was a
Spanish philosopher.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.420
So in the 18th century.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.530
And he was one of the last
general scientists, you know.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.630
He, it was not only about
science, and, you know,

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.520
real science, and humanity,
but it was still the idea

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.880
of putting everything together.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:15.330
So he wrote textbooks about
optics, about insects.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.230
But also, of course,
about fine arts.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.310
And his major quote and his
major idea was that music,

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.850
or fine art in general,
shouldn't be only

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.690
for the upper 10,000, what
he said, but should be able

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.350
to enjoy for everybody.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.220
So kind of the opposite of
what [inaudible] would stand

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.350
for later -- you know,
the flow of [inaudible],

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.740
which means art is really like
in an own tower of, in German,

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.230
we say [speaking foreign
language], you know.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.900
And it's, and, but so he decided

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.420
and he said it should be
available for everybody.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.730
And as quartet is
a very pure art.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.170
I mean, I always say
it's not like opera.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.660
It's more like poetry.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.660
I mean, 4 people talking to each
other without any substitute,

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.860
like not 40 camels on
the stage or something.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.130
You know, like in operas,
it's just boring 4 peoples,

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.010
but they are playing
the most beautiful music

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.570
and the most exciting music.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.340
And as it was always like
for saloons or for every,

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.790
for very educated people,
this kind of music,

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.170
we decided it should
be, like Minguet said,

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.520
should be available
for everybody.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.040
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger: And
this idea is always more

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.080
and more important.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.840
This year, we had already
the chance to play,

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.650
for example, in South Korea.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:48.950
Now, we are here.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.250
We were in Mongolia.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.550
We were in Hong Kong.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.390
It's not only to go there,
and there, and there,

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.810
but also to bring
the people together.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.660
And for us, it's really great
to be here today and also

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.910
to bring this idea here for--

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.210
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: And
you also play

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.640
in hospitals and prisons, right?

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.220
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger: Sometimes,
if there are some projects, yes.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.680
If we have a chance, we--

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.890
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: Charity
concerts, yeah, of course.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.880
If, and for kids
in schools as well,

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.330
we have a education
program running in Germany.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.860
Actually, founded by a famous
pianist colleague, [inaudible],

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.600
who's probably well
known here as well.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.250
He invented the broken
chord rhapsody in school,

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.750
funnily enough, and so we are
part of this project as well.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.620
So when we come into a city
and we have enough time,

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.390
then in the morning, we go to
schools and play for children

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.620
or students, and hope that they
come in the evening as well.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.940
[laughs] And sometimes,
they does.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.240
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger:
And sometimes,

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.620
we have also the chance to
do this in foreign countries.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.700
For example, we did it for 500
children in India or something.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.000
[laughs] Yeah.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.300
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: You've toured
in India, then, as well.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.600
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: Yes.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.900
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Oh my goodness.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.200
And so, in your spare time,

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.500
I think you also have
a festival, right?

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.800
Is it, it's you who
has the festival?

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.100
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: Yeah,
I just invented recently.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.060
It's in, yeah, near
where we live in Cologne.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.540
We are the quartet that's based
in Cologne, and we are actually,

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.980
over the years, not really
living in Cologne anymore,

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.280
so it'd be a little bit spread,

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.120
and I live outside
Cologne in the countryside.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.750
It's a very beautiful
area between Germany

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.120
and Belgium kind
of on the border.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.730
And very old houses from
1600, really European old.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:38.570
And so -- [laughter] yeah
-- so as, even old for us,

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.720
so I just started a
little festival, yeah,

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.590
to give something back because
I love to live there and I try

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.440
to give something back to
the village people there.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.740
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: So, yeah.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.170
Well, obviously, you're very
busy all over the world,

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.960
and the repertoire
particularly interests me --

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.940
the fact that you've made time
to really study and pursue a lot

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.450
of these people that
we don't know.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.850
And I wanted to start
with [inaudible].

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:05.610
Am I saying this correctly?

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.550
We have actually
on display tonight

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.790
in our glass case a
copious manuscript

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.610
of the piece you are
performing tonight.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:12.910
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: No, really?

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.280
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Yes, we've,
my colleagues found it

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.990
in our collections, and
it's, it probably came

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.640
from an aristocratic household

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.440
where they had regular
music evenings, you know.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.330
And we also have a
whole Czech display --

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.810
[inaudible] and [inaudible] --

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.860
including the autograph

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.280
of the Mahler song
that you transcribed.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.300
And we'll get to
that in a moment.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.970
But I wanted to, [inaudible]
is a name that is so new to us,

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.970
and how long have you
been playing his work?

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.370
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger: It's also
new for us, but [laughs] we,

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.280
[laughs] he was a composer
of the Mannheim [phonetic].

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.520
It's a Mannheim school.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:56.340
And he was a colleague or friend
of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.390
And I discussed with an
organizer of concerts

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:03.980
from [inaudible] some years
ago, and he, which is very close

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:08.330
to the [inaudible] or the Czech
Republic, and he brought me

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.670
to this composer
and to this name,

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:15.040
and it's a good alternative
to Mozart to Haydn

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.250
to show really the music of
the time, not the upper class,

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.900
but the music of the people.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.620
So I think it's very
interesting.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.080
And for me, when, if I can come

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:32.200
to the whole program a little
bit, it's our Bohemian program,

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.790
but all the composers
are international people

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:37.420
in their time.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:44.020
So this [inaudible], he was born
in Prague, but he died in Rome.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.850
And he had a very
colored [laughs] life,

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:50.940
and it was very hard to
travel in this time, to,

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.880
for example, from
Prague to Italy.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.560
And he was on other places too.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:00.210
And he was [inaudible] naturally
as a son-of-law from, of Dvorak.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:04.620
He was also very international,
Dvorak, it's well known.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:12.220
[inaudible], who worked with
so many international things

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:16.740
like the [inaudible] of
Tolstoy, which is Russian.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.390
And Mahler, the story
is also one.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:23.020
And he was born in the
Czech Republic, Mahler.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.320
Yeah, yeah.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.450
So it's really a
complete Bohemian program.

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.670
Yeah. [laughs] In a way.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:30.400
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: As soon as I
saw the Mahler song on there,

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.780
I said, this is exciting.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.670
We've got to choose
this program.

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:37.920
And I want to talk to you a
little bit about how you decided

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.660
to -- do you transcribe
a lot of things?

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:41.320
We'll talk about that.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.790
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger:
That's my Opus 1.

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:44.090
[laughter]

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:45.390
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Okay, okay.

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:49.340
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger: And I did
it only, I had always the dream

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:53.950
to do this because we don't
have repertoire of Mahler,

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:57.500
and it's one of my
famous, my most,

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:01.940
the composers what I
like very, very much.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:05.270
And I'm, my hometown
is where I was born.

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:07.710
It's in the near of all this.

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:10.510
It's [inaudible], so it's
all in front of the Danube

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:12.660
and near the Attersee

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:16.050
where Mahler composed the
second and third symphony.

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:21.440
And in 2011, when there was
the Mahler year of death,

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.760
100 years of death, I
thought it would be very nice

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.340
to bring something
to the people,

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:28.860
especially in the smaller cities

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.980
where they cannot hear
a symphony of Mahler

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:34.810
because it's too
expensive for them.

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:37.420
And I thought perhaps
a little chance

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:42.350
to bring the great harmonic
in this small piece,

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:44.490
and it's very good
to combine it also

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:48.900
with the Second Viennese
School with Webern, and it's,

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:53.340
or with a bridge from
Brahms, from Beethoven,

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:54.640
[inaudible], et cetera.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.440
So it's a, only a
small mosaic stone.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.060
[laughs]

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:00.500
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: You know, I
want to go back to [inaudible]

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:04.030
for just a moment
too, but before we,

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:05.990
let's go back and
forth a moment.

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:10.380
So the Mahler, I was
thinking when I heard this,

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:14.090
the Suk piece, the Balada, that
it had reminded me a little bit

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:17.920
of some of the Mahler harmonies
and ideas in his piano quartet,

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.140
which was also a teenage piece.

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:24.150
You know, this Suk piece you
said was 16, he was 16 or so

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:25.990
when he wrote the piece, but

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:30.610
and my colleague hears
the early Wagner harmonies

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:33.450
of Lohengrin in the Balada too.

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:36.510
So it's a very interesting
piece, and he's somebody

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:38.120
that we don't know enough about.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.920
And as you say, he's a figure
that his history is woven

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.430
through the whole history,

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:46.000
his family history
of Czech quartets.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.230
And was, he was with the
Czech quartet itself, right?

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:50.880
Yeah, the famous quartet.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.410
And I think premiered
some of these works.

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:56.530
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger: It's
a dynasty of violinists.

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:58.610
He, this Josef Suk
-- there are more,

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.870
some different Josef Suks--

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.170
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Yeah.

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:03.470
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger:
Because this--

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:04.770
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Exactly.

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:06.070
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger: Josef Suk,
he was son-in-law of Dvorak,

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:08.800
and sometimes I think
when I hear the music,

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:13.380
he would like to be the
son-in-law of Dvorak,

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.680
so he composed [inaudible].

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:20.090
So because later, he
composed in direction,

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:22.330
already in the direction
of Second Viennese School.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:25.280
There are, he recorded all
his works for string quartet,

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:30.790
and it's really far away from
these sounds of Bohemian sounds.

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:32.090
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Yes,
very modernist.

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:33.390
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger: And
there is another Josef Suk.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.090
He was the son, or son, yeah.

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:37.440
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: The
interesting thing is

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.240
that at this time,
we are talking now,

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.570
we are thinking borders, right?

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:44.010
Czech, Austria, and Germany.

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:47.640
We have to think, in this time,
this was kind of 1 culture,

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.150
or it was really mixed.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.840
When you think, Franz Kafka
was writing in German,

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.930
living in Prague,
writing in German.

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:58.350
Mahler, which is, we
think of, of course,

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:02.040
an Austrian composer,
but born in Czech.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:06.060
And so this is very important
to know that this was kind

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:11.460
of a combination and, of
several cultures and influence.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.900
It's not about nationalism
at all.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.700
So this is very important
that, like you said with the --

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:19.440
and Wagner, of course,
as well coming into it --

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:26.890
and I think the time was ready
for, to improve the harmonic,

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:33.260
into a chromatic, harmonic
[inaudible], which said, okay,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.840
there is nothing, there
is no, I can't go on.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.250
I can't go any further.

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:40.860
That's, you know, after
Mahler, what shall we do?

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.260
It's so tensed already.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:43.670
It's so chromatic.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:46.620
The harmonies, so I
have to do something new

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.120
to be still expressive.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:54.600
But at this time, like Suk,
Mahler, Dvorak, they started

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.970
to explore -- I mean,
even earlier, Schumann --

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:59.160
but there with Schumann, we
are more in the right area.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:04.300
So this is more up,
up, more northern.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.230
But in Czech, they
started really

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:11.290
to experience how far can they
go to expand the harmonic,

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:16.020
the major and minor harmonic
with a lot of chromatic

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.470
like Mahler did, yeah.

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:22.320
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: This, in terms
of the quartet tradition,

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.310
each of these works that
you're playing tonight takes it

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:26.730
in a further step.

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:29.840
Like with [inaudible],
he was a classicist,

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:34.000
but he was a model perhaps
for Mozart and so on,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.760
but he also was doing
symphonies, and opera seria,

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:40.600
and, you know, wind quintets,
but he, they say he's someone

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.270
who helped develop the roots
for this early quartet form,

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:47.630
and I believe I understand
that he, his works were known

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:50.100
as divertimenti, as
Haydn's early ones were

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.400
also divertimenti.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.030
So you have him, and then,
as you say, you have Suk.

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:55.850
Such an interesting figure.

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:59.600
And this too, and going on to
[inaudible], I'm so interested

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.520
in hearing your thoughts
about this piece.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.910
You could talk about it so much
from both the programmatic point

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:08.890
of view exhaustively, [laughs]
and you can also talk about it

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.090
from the structural point
of view, which you must know

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:13.450
so intimately, so I want
to talk about that too.

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:14.750
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: Of course.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:16.270
I think it's a very interesting
program because, yeah,

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:19.810
let's start from
another point of view.

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:23.670
We are all, we have the
tendency in a lot of programs,

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:26.250
a lot of times, when we
play music from the past,

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:29.860
that we just concentrate
on absolutely highlights.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:33.220
And then, we think the whole
time is like that, but it's not,

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.220
and we have to honor

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:40.510
and appreciate all the
kind of ground workers.

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:42.420
I mean, Mozart, outstanding.

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.720
Beethoven, outstanding.

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.020
Schumann, outstanding.

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:48.550
But there have been
loads of other composers

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:52.070
which were very important for
the time and very important

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:55.260
for these highlights
composers as well.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:59.400
I mean, we all know the
drama story about Salieri

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.580
and Mozart, for example.

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:04.470
So, and but this is
very, very important,

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:07.920
and I think it's also
important to play the music

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:12.660
to really understand,
why is Mozart a genius

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.730
and Salieri is absolutely great

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:16.670
but maybe not a genius,
you know?

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:19.700
So, and that's might be
the same as [inaudible].

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:23.290
So he's, he was very, very
important in the time,

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:27.740
and it's not fair to
not play him anymore.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.270
And he's really,
really wonderful.

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:35.700
He's maybe not Beethoven or not
Haydn genius, but he's very,

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:39.600
very good, and it's worth,
absolutely worth playing it.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.540
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: What I heard
you rehearsing was very--

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:42.840
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: Yeah.

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.140
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Interesting
to me, and you, you know,

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:45.440
I wouldn't have known which
composer it was, really,

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:48.550
but it was so graceful,
elegant writing, and so on.

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:49.850
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: Absolutely.

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:51.150
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: We're
looking forward.

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:52.450
It's fun. Through you,

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:54.420
we are discovering something
we didn't have the chance

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.130
to before.

00:15:56.130 --> 00:16:00.110
And before leaving him,
I was going to just say

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:02.670
that people talk
about him as somebody

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.480
that Mozart was very
connected to,

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:05.930
and they had all
these references

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:07.860
in the correspondence to him.

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:10.110
He might look about, I think
there's some references

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:14.070
in our program, but there are
more than 40 comments about him

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:17.670
in the family correspondence,
so he was really an intimate

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:22.990
for a period of time, a major
figure in opera, and the,

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:25.400
the writers who write
about these, of course,

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.780
these kinds of things,
and comment on the letters

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:31.730
so that the letter about
him, when Mozart visited him

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:33.030
in the hospital, I believe,

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:34.940
or after he'd had some
very serious treatments

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.300
for what was most
likely syphilis,

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:42.300
but the letter is very, very
personal and affecting more

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.600
so than much of the
correspondence that you read

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:48.280
from Mozart and very empathetic
with the man's situation.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.930
And he said, how could
I leave my friend,

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:53.170
my dear friend [inaudible]?

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:56.910
So anyway, as you say,
a model and a friend.

00:16:56.910 --> 00:17:00.580
I want to talk with
you too a little bit

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:04.560
about the Czech quartet sound
and that Central European sound.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:09.180
This is a bit of a non segue,
but, non sequitur, but,

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:12.900
you know, you hear these
great, great Czech quartets,

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:17.390
just like German quartets, which
have that deep, rich sound,

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:20.340
and they have a certain
kind of a feel

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:21.980
about the timbre and so on.

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:26.270
We've had so many through
here at the library --

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:29.040
you know, [inaudible]
and so on --

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.450
so do you think that this is
something, from your study,

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:35.770
is this something one
learns about as a style?

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:37.070
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger:
Yes, it is,

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:39.290
and I think there is
still a big difference

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:41.880
between the Czech quartets
and the German quartets

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.350
or the Austrian quartets.

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:46.720
It's very funny because when I
was a child, I had the chance

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.270
to go to concerts very
early with my parents,

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:52.800
and because I'm coming
from the [inaudible], yeah,

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:57.600
from the [inaudible] to the
Czech Republic, only 20 minutes

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:04.570
by car, they came -- also,
before, the wall was gone --

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:08.720
they came to our city for
concerts, and it was, for me,

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:12.970
it, a, I had not the
view in the future

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:14.780
that I will play quartet later,

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.620
so [laughs] I started
still with my violin.

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:21.710
But I remember very good
that the people were very,

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:26.700
very close together and
in very old coat, dress,

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:31.700
so it was very impressive
to see them.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:37.190
It was not a highlight, but
to be together and team,

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:44.120
really deep teamwork I remember
very good to these concerts.

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.420
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener:
Yeah, I think they --

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:49.490
I am a strong believer --
well, nowadays, you know,

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:53.590
we have teachers from
all over the world,

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:55.290
and it's mixed more and more.

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:58.310
And so why is a German
quartet sounding different

00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:00.620
from a French quartet,
and an English quartet,

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:02.330
and the Russian quartet still?

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:05.260
We still might have the teacher.

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:08.140
For example, I had the same
teacher like colleagues playing

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:11.940
in other quartets, so why is,
why are they sounding different?

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:16.640
I'm a strong believer that's
because of the language, yeah.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.220
So it's the same, you know,

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:23.200
why is a Russian composer
writing different in terms

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:27.680
of sounds for songs, for
example, than a German composer,

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:31.990
or why is an Italian opera,
Puccini, sounding so different

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:35.400
from Mozart or Beethoven opera?

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.820
I mean, both, all of them great
composers, but why is it --

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.030
I think it's the language.

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:44.290
It's the sound of the
language is the chromatic --

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:45.590
you know, I have an Indian wife.

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:49.210
She's always saying
Germany, German sounds

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:50.510
so [makes cacophonic sounds].

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:52.310
So, [laughter] and you
can say it like that,

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:54.220
or you can say it's
very structured.

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:58.400
So no -- that's what I prefer.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.670
[laughter]

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:06.230
So, but so no wonder
Bach is German, you know.

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:07.550
It's a fugue, you know.

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:08.850
You have a fugue.

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:11.480
You have 1 voice and
then, mathematically,

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:14.040
you can really count on,
after a couple of [inaudible],

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.460
coming the second voice,

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.770
and then it's coming the first
voice again, the second voice.

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:19.190
It's organized.

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:23.570
It's absolutely organized,
and the art is to make music

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:26.140
out of this structure
because when you keep it

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:29.990
as a structure -- we learn
this at music conservatory.

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:31.290
I can write a fugue,

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:35.570
but my fugue unfortunately
sounds not like a Bach fugue.

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:36.870
So it is--

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:38.170
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger: Not yet.

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:39.470
[laughs]

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:40.770
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: No, yeah.

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:42.070
So this is the, so and I think,

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:44.130
even everything is
so close in Europe.

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:46.780
I mean, it's a couple
of kilometers to France,

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:51.510
to Belgium to the Czech
Republic or, like Annette said,

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:52.850
I was confronted with a lot

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:55.050
of Russian quartets
when I was young.

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:58.990
Borodin Quartet came over,
and they played wonderfully.

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:02.590
And so, but it's still
really unique sound

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:05.860
of every string quartet,
so I think it has

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.430
to do with the language.

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:08.730
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger:
But, sorry,

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:11.050
but also with the political
situation because I remember

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:15.470
that [inaudible], he said
when he found the State Opera,

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:17.310
Berlin Orchestra, he
found an orchestra

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:21.070
with a sound 50 years
before or 80 years before.

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:22.370
It was really old sound.

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:25.080
And he's so happy
with this orchestra,

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:27.130
and he tries I think to--

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:28.920
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: To keep.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.790
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger: To keep
the sound because it was so,

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:35.670
such -- they were in the
east part of Germany.

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:37.780
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: Yeah,
with orchestras, it's much--

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:39.320
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger: It's
very impressive for me.

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:40.620
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Yeah.

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:41.920
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger: Yeah.

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.220
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: Yeah,
I think with orchestras,

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:44.550
it's more, much more difficult
to keep the unique sound.

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:47.610
You see, like, Berlin
Philharmonics, you know,

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:49.700
with [inaudible] had a
absolutely unique sound.

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.510
And nowadays, they have a very
-- well, they are amazing --

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:56.420
but they have a very modern
sound, and I think like 50%

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:58.900
of the orchestra
are international.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.790
It's an international
orchestra, meanwhile.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:03.940
So, but like the Vienna
Orchestra, they still --

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:07.130
especially the woodwinds because
they have an own academy --

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:11.640
and they keep their
special sound, you know.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.610
The oboe has no vibrato.

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:15.160
I think the flute is very --

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.300
they have a special
type of French horn.

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:20.540
So they really keep their old
sound kind of military like.

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:24.040
I mean, really strict while all
the other orchestras are getting

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.020
more and more mixed, you
know, internationally mixed.

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:33.370
So it's, nowadays, it's hard
for me to really divide if it's,

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:37.150
is it Boston Symphony or
Berlin Philharmonics, you know,

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:38.600
when you hear a modern
recording?

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.860
Really, it's difficult, but
when you hear old recording,

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:42.160
it's much easier.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.270
I think, so it's easier with
smaller groups like in a quartet

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:49.790
when they're all coming kind
of from the same country.

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:51.090
Then, it's--

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:52.390
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: I hear them
so well, and I'm very curious,

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:55.410
you know -- thank you for
answering this at this length

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:57.900
because it's fascinating, you
know, to have a perspective

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.160
on this, quartet sounds.

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:02.260
But going back to your
comment about language,

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:05.850
this is fascinating because it
relates directly to this work

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:10.520
that we'll hear tonight because
Janacek, as you know much more

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:15.750
than we, was fascinated with
melodies of Czech speech,

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:18.320
and he called them
speech tunelets.

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:22.190
He transcribed literally
thousands of these snippets

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:25.020
of speech that he heard on the
street, and in shops, and so on,

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:28.910
and he felt fervently
that this was an element

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:30.990
that one could use and
should use in music,

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:32.370
and he was inspired by them.

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:34.540
Some writers say this
is extremely valid

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:35.840
and you can hear it.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.450
Other people say, well, maybe it
was something particular to him.

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:41.350
Well, that relates to
what we're talking about.

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:43.740
One other thing that
just popped in my mind is

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:47.260
that somebody was telling me one
time that for Russian singers,

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:48.740
you know, people always
say, what's the secret

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:51.130
of the great Russian bassists
because they have deep,

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:53.120
incredible, low sound?

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:56.920
And someone who knows about
Russian language said, well,

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:58.830
it might be because they,

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:02.100
the way that people pronounce
Russian involves different

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:06.660
muscles in the lower larynx
and throat, and they use these

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:08.250
in singing in the
cathedrals, the,

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:10.120
you know, liturgy, who knows.

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:13.090
But these things
are all fascinating.

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:14.580
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: Might be
the vodka as well, but yeah.

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:15.880
[laughter]

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.180
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:19.250
So, well, this is a good
segue to talk about the--

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:20.550
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: Yes.

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:21.850
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: [inaudible]
Sonata, Number 1, and it's,

00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:24.260
at least the last 2 quartets
of [inaudible] are just,

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:28.660
and stunningly dramatic,
full of passion, rage, power.

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:33.110
And I would like to hear from
you how you approach these,

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:37.330
the intimate letters and
this one we'll hear tonight,

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:39.120
the Kreutzer Sonata.

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:40.420
[inaudible]

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:41.720
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: Yeah.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.020
I think, well, I
love this subject.

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.320
This is one of my
favorite subjects to talk

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:47.860
about what we call
program music or not.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:53.640
And by the way, about composer's
life and their work as well.

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:54.940
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Yeah.

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:56.240
Oh, yeah.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.540
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener:
This is kind of the,

00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:58.840
one of the same [inaudible].

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:02.490
I am a big fan of looking
at the work sometimes even

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:04.700
without knowing who
the composer is

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:06.850
and without knowing
what time it was.

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:08.150
Just the work.

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:10.320
I think the work is
the most important.

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:14.450
It's not important if
Mozart was ill at this time

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:16.110
and he wrote a certain piece,

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:19.530
or if his wife got a
second child, or whatever.

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:22.370
This is, it might be interesting
for us because we are,

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:25.500
we want to know about
this person

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:28.090
because we're always
trying to keep,

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:30.980
why is he so fantastic
and maybe I'm not?

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:32.280
Or whatever.

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.640
But in, [laughs] it's, so
we have a certain interest

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:38.980
in biographies, but I'm a strong
believer that this has nothing

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:40.350
to do with the work at the end.

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:46.190
I think the work is kind of
a thing which is much more

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:48.160
than the person who
wrote it, you know.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:52.760
The work is much bigger than
the human body who wrote it.

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:55.550
I, it's, he's a,
he was a medium.

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:57.340
He was just writing
it down, you know.

00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:01.880
It's a God-given thing, and it's
written down, and he gave it

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:05.150
to us, and it was, God
chose just a random body

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:06.450
to write it down.

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:08.530
I mean, Stravinsky said
[inaudible] he was,

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:11.080
it was flowing in
3 days through him.

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.750
He was, it was, he
was dictated to do it.

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:15.470
So this is, I mean,
this is the 1 thing.

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:17.560
And then, now, we
come to program music.

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:18.860
I think it's very interesting.

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:21.070
And of course, we have
to talk about Tolstoy.

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:24.900
And it, so, but you can
listen to this work,

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:27.910
and it stays a fantastic piece

00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:32.940
without knowing anything
from the story.

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:34.670
It's the same as [inaudible].

00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:36.110
You can listen to this piece.

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:37.540
It's a fantastic rondo.

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:38.890
You don't have to
know the story.

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:41.690
When I was a child, I
was listening to Tosca,

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:43.710
and I was so touched
by the music,

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:47.830
I didn't had a clue what was
going on, but I loved the music.

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:51.100
And later, when I go to
know the story, I was bored.

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:54.610
I mean, it, the story's
okay, but the music is

00:26:54.610 --> 00:26:56.190
so much better than the story.

00:26:56.190 --> 00:27:00.770
So it's, you can always,
when it's about music,

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:03.310
you can keep the music as it is.

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:04.830
Of course, the story
is touching.

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:08.040
I mean, it's a masterwork,
this novel itself.

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:12.540
And it's fantastic how he made
it and, but the structure,

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:14.670
as you talked about,
the structure,

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:18.410
the music structure is so
perfect, you can listen to it

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:21.510
and enjoy it so much
without knowing the story.

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:22.970
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger:
And the next thing is

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:27.340
that it's not important
how we understand the story

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:30.080
because if I try to
understand the story,

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:32.900
perhaps I associate
my own biography

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:34.730
or something, and
it's so terrible.

00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:38.610
If everybody of the
quartet -- it's so terrible,

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:41.050
[laughs] you have
to stay objective.

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:42.350
It's--

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:43.650
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Yeah.

00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:44.950
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger:
The most important thing.

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:46.250
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: That's
why I wanted

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:47.550
to ask you how you approach
the work rather than--

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:48.850
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger:
By playing emotionally.

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:50.150
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Assuming that
it was one way or another, but--

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:51.450
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: Yeah, we
are sitting not there and say,

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:53.370
you know, oh, this is the piece
where he got into the train.

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:54.670
Really? Is this a train?

00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:55.970
No, I don't think it's a train.

00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:57.270
It can't be the train.

00:27:57.270 --> 00:27:58.570
That is why he's so angry.

00:27:58.570 --> 00:27:59.870
We don't talk about that--

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:01.170
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger:
It's terrible.

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:02.470
Absolutely terrible.

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:03.770
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: At all.

00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:05.070
We just look at the music.

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:06.370
We see that it's
written fortissimo,

00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:07.670
and there's this
crescendo, and there's --

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:09.880
he's writing so absolutely
amazing precisely.

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:13.850
Even, you know, when you hear
the [inaudibly], the first kind

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:17.010
of theme part, [humming]
it's coming 3 times.

00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:20.370
And it's coming every, in
a slightly different tempo.

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:22.980
It's so precisely written,

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:25.170
so you don't have
to know the story.

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:29.390
Maybe the train was a little
bit faster there, so, no.

00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:30.690
[laughter] Forget that.

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:33.150
It really, it's about the music.

00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:36.170
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: And you, there
are these, a lot of people

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:38.850
who study this and talk about
it in terms of architecture.

00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:42.230
And as you say, even if
you don't know architecture

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:45.970
or whatever, you can hear
the 1 person I was reading --

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:49.560
Stedron, I think was the, Milos
Stedron -- talked about montage,

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:53.670
modality, and architecture
in Janocek's work.

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:55.590
And they're just so
brilliant the way

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:57.860
that they're put together, you
don't have to be a musician

00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:59.920
or a composer to perceive it.

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:02.400
But it, that must be
fascinating to study it

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.280
and to be so intimate with it.

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:07.370
And there's so many
things throughout this.

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:11.190
There's, Eugene Drucker I think
from the Emerson Quartet is one

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:14.670
of many commentators who said
there is a canonic melody

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:17.950
relationship to the
Beethoven sonata.

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:20.030
Some people maybe
don't see it as much.

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:22.430
That's 1 thing that's
of interest.

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:25.790
There's fascinating
sul ponticello writing,

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:28.770
and perhaps you'd like
to speak about that.

00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:30.070
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: Yeah,

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:32.900
there are some special
effects, absolutely.

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:37.120
And, but I totally agree it's a,
not a very long piece, but it's,

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:43.120
from the first note until
the last note, it's so full

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:46.860
of tension, and it's the
timing and the construction.

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:49.140
Like you said, the
construction is amazing.

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:54.550
It's a, it's, everything is, the
architecture is just perfect.

00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:57.290
It's not very long, but
the tension and the timing,

00:29:57.290 --> 00:29:59.530
and when he, even the last --

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:01.360
well, I shouldn't
tell it so much

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.800
because you should
experience it --

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.540
[laughter] but it's
the last note.

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:09.100
It's short but a little fermata
on, so it's absolutely great

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:13.830
that it's not a long note, so
he's not releasing you yet.

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:15.130
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger: And
never sentimental ever.

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:16.870
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: Yeah,
it's never sentimental.

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:20.630
He's not whiney thing about
this like the novel is.

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:22.040
It's very objective.

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:24.280
Just looking at it as it is.

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:27.010
And he's not rounding
up at the end.

00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:30.900
At the end of the piece, when
we do it right, you are shocked.

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:33.500
You'll sit there, and the
piece is stopping kind

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:34.800
of in the middle.

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:37.380
We are not giving you
the time to relax again

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:38.970
and to feel good again.

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:40.270
You won't.

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:41.570
You will be shocked.

00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:44.080
And this piece is like that.

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.810
It's a perfect timing.

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:47.970
I think music has a
lot to do with timing.

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:49.920
I mean, it's happening in time,

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.680
so it's about timing
-- energy and time.

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:56.760
And he's a absolutely
great master with it.

00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:58.730
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: And
the timbre too.

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:03.060
I hear so many fascinating
uses of timbre against timbre,

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:05.050
and coming out of
it, and using timbre

00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:08.110
as a structural conception,
you know.

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:11.770
And that there's a lot
of fascinating moments

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:14.150
where you hear these
sort of outbursts.

00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:15.730
And you'll hear them
very clearly.

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:19.300
And some are, like, declamations
getting back to the question

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:23.020
of speech and language, and
he says 1 thing with great,

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:25.950
a great outcry, and then
there's a moment of pathos.

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:27.970
So they're just fascinating.

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:30.230
I don't know how
we're doing on time,

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:32.280
but we could talk a
bit more about this

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:33.580
and about the Tolstoy,

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:35.480
but I know you guys will
have some questions.

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:36.780
Yeah, we have a little
more time.

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:40.650
[laughs] One thing that,
again, we could talk

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:43.850
about a little bit is this
-- oh, a question about,

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:47.370
continuing just for a
moment, about the viola.

00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:50.920
Is, does this quartet have
a big role for the viola

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:54.120
like the second quartet,
the intimate letters?

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:56.400
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener:
I wouldn't say so.

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.390
Not, it's kind of equal.

00:31:58.390 --> 00:31:59.690
I wouldn't say--

00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:00.990
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Because
I know in that one,

00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:04.020
he equates the viola to his,
the woman he was obsessed

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:05.790
with for so long, [inaudible].

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:08.310
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener:
Not exceptional or not

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:09.610
like [inaudible] on a quartet

00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:11.770
where the instrument
of the composers.

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:15.620
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: That was 1
question I had, and about,

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:19.060
in general, I was
curious your thinking

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:23.670
on how you perform Dvorak
and Janocek back to back.

00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:26.130
That is quite a challenge
in a way, you know.

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:28.880
Totally different
but so connected.

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.340
They were friends,
right, I think?

00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:31.640
They knew each other quite well.

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:32.950
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger: Yes,
but for us, really, also,

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:35.850
contemporary music,
it's, all is music,

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:40.660
and we go with the same feeling

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:44.970
and with the same seriosity
[phonetic] to everything.

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:47.550
It's, for us, it's always,
really always the same

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:51.280
from [inaudible] to
contemporary, to premieres.

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:53.470
It's only reading
the score and--

00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:54.770
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Each piece is--

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:56.070
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger: Yeah.

00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:57.370
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Lives
in its own universe.

00:32:57.370 --> 00:32:58.670
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger:
Perhaps a top secret [laughs]

00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:00.280
from our group.

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:03.230
We had times where we just
discussed a lot about pictures

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:05.840
in our brain, and everybody
said, oh, I see this,

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:09.800
and I feel this, and it was
so terrible because, oh no,

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.100
and that's not my idea.

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:14.260
And so we had to, it was
really hours for hours.

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:17.360
And one day, we discussed
and said, no.

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:21.670
Please let us not speak
about pictures in your brain

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:26.320
because also, everybody in the
audience has his own pictures,

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:29.430
and we discussed about the
score and what is written.

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:33.380
We hope that we have the
old text, the, really,

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:35.980
what the composers
wrote in this,

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:37.760
his time, and that's enough.

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:42.260
And we try to realize.

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:44.020
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:47.920
The task, I think to do
with our education as well.

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:49.220
We are one of the quartets --

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:51.080
I saw the colleagues
[inaudible] are coming.

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:53.220
They are another quartet
coming from the [inaudible]

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:58.850
with the great [inaudible]
quartet with [inaudible].

00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:01.630
And, I mean, he's very
well known here, of course.

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:02.930
He's a--

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:04.230
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger:
Our teacher.

00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:05.530
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener:
And he was our teacher

00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:06.830
for many, many years.

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:10.260
And he was a quartet trainer,
outstanding quartet trainer.

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:15.420
I mean, all things quartets
our generation, yeah,

00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:17.490
educated by him, trained by him.

00:34:17.490 --> 00:34:22.650
And he was a big, big fan
of just doing what's written

00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:24.290
in the score, you know.

00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:26.740
Once, I remember
I was asking him,

00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:29.060
shouldn't be this another
color or something,

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:32.110
another more colorful,
another color, darker color?

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:39.480
He was looking at me and
saying, am I a painter or what?

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:42.790
[laughter] You know, he
wasn't even talking in terms

00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:45.480
of colors -- light,
dark, or something.

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:49.580
It was just about
tones, dynamics, tempo,

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:51.500
articulation, and [inaudible].

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:55.100
But this particular in,
you know, he really looked

00:34:55.100 --> 00:35:00.560
at the handwriting to find out
if it's a point or a little,

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:04.280
or could it be a legato,
or maybe more kind

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:07.210
of another thing, you know,
he was absolutely accurate

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:09.670
in this thing, and this
was very, very important.

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:11.110
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger: And he
came always to the lessons

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:15.400
with his Mr. Beat,
which was the metronome.

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.170
Always first, metronome.

00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:18.470
[laughs]

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:19.770
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener:
He was tapping to find

00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:21.360
out if you keep the
tempo and stuff, yeah.

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.320
So this is kind of our school.

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:30.440
So we decided not to talk
too much about our emotions.

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:31.850
And by the way, I mean--

00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:33.150
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger:
But we have.

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:34.450
We have.

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:35.750
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener:
Yeah, we have.

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:37.050
And [inaudible] also.

00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:38.890
I mean, I also saw him
after a great performance

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:40.220
with tears in his eyes.

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:42.810
He, of course, he, I mean, yeah.

00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:47.230
But working and talking about
music, it's more helpful

00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:52.390
to really see -- you know,
we are not really artists

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:55.240
in the sense that we
create something new.

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:57.530
We are just like actors are.

00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:58.990
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger:
Reproducing.

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:00.790
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: Yeah, we
are bringing something to you,

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:03.830
so it's not us tonight.

00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:05.130
We are just delivering.

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:10.400
So our emotions or
my emotions I have

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.110
when I hear the music
I'm playing tonight,

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:15.430
and it's my personal stuff.

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:20.800
I don't want to be in between
the work, the composer's work,

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.760
or let's even keep
the composer out,

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:24.460
as I said before,
about the work.

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:28.040
I don't want to be in the way
of the work and you tonight.

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:32.510
I'm just delivering, and I hope
I do it exactly how the composer

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:33.810
has written.

00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:35.800
I'm not playing it less loud

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:40.020
because I think it's nicer
this way or more loud.

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:43.610
I'm, I try really to do what
the composer was written.

00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:45.290
And it's up to you
how you like it.

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:46.940
I don't smooth things up.

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:51.300
And this is why Annette
said we don't discuss even

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:54.490
about the quality of certain
pieces anymore, and this--

00:36:54.490 --> 00:36:55.790
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger: True.

00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:57.090
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: Brings
us to modern music as well.

00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:58.390
We are delivering.

00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:02.610
We don't decide if it's worth
bringing it on stage or not.

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:07.930
I mean, who am I to decide what
kind of, what quality it is?

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:09.230
You should decide.

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:10.530
I'm just delivering it.

00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:13.330
Without me, you'd never --
when I decide this is a,

00:37:13.330 --> 00:37:17.410
not a good piece, then
it won't come to you.

00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:19.330
And you might like it a lot,

00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:23.050
so who am I to not
give you this piece?

00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:24.790
So I think it's very
important --

00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:27.220
maybe this is a bridge
to the modern music --

00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:30.640
it's, we have, it's like, you
know, like mountain climbers

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:33.340
when they are asked, why are
you climbing on mountains,

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:35.280
their answer is because
they are there.

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:39.800
So the modern music is there,
and it must be performed.

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:41.290
Otherwise, it's not living.

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:43.090
That's what Wolfgang
Rihm said always --

00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:47.680
my music is not there
if it's not played.

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:51.640
And so we have to play it,
and you might like it or not.

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:52.940
So, yeah. But--

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:54.240
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: You're
doing a remarkable job,

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:55.540
really, as I was saying.

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:57.010
You should look at
the recordings

00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:59.980
of these masters that are--

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:01.280
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger:
And we continue always.

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:02.580
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Monuments today.

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:04.790
Yeah, and always growing, and
I wish we had time to talk

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:07.270
about how the string quartet
repertoire is growing,

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:09.070
the techniques, and
all the things

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:12.840
which you are pushing
it to do and so on.

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:15.680
And also, we didn't cover
the Tolstoy sonata with,

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:16.980
I mean, novella.

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:18.280
We didn't get there quite.

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:21.490
But 1 last question, and
that is, do you ever think

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:25.380
of the Dvorak quartet in
American terms in any way?

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:29.160
This is, having said what you've
said, it seems like you don't,

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:31.580
you wouldn't see it as
an American influence,

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:33.450
or American sounds,
or, you know--

00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:34.870
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger:
There are a lot.

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:36.170
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: There are some?

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:37.470
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger: Yeah.

00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:38.770
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Yeah.

00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:40.070
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger: And
especially today, we came by car

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:41.370
from [inaudible], and
I saw some things,

00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:44.140
and I associated it
during the rehearsal.

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:45.440
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Really?

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:46.740
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger: Yes.

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:48.040
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Oh, yes?

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.340
What were they?

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:50.640
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger: Yeah,
because our travels --

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:51.940
and we travel a lot
-- are always also--

00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:53.240
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Oh,
that's right.

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:54.540
The Virginia countryside.

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:55.840
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger: Yeah.

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.140
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: You drove
from, you know, Maryland.

00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:58.440
Salisbury, Maryland you said.

00:38:58.440 --> 00:38:59.740
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger:
Yeah, yeah.

00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:01.040
So we saw already so much from
the landscape, and the people,

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:02.340
and the black people,
and everything is

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:03.640
so inspiring for our job.

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:04.940
[laughs]

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:06.240
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: Yes.

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:08.000
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger:
Also, the language, also.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.390
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: And
it's, of course, there are,

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:11.620
it's a lot of, I mean, he
traveled over the country,

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:14.520
and he talked to the people,
and he listened to the songs.

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:16.870
And, of course, I
mean, it's, yeah.

00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:20.930
It's a lot of American influence
in, and every, but then,

00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:24.470
of course, you always,
as the title is American

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:27.870
and he wasn't American, it
was, but then there's a lot

00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:31.360
of Czech parts in
it as well because,

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.990
sorry to say, he
didn't, he want--

00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:34.290
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger:
[laughs] Staying.

00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:36.090
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: He wanted
to say he was happy to go back.

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:38.920
And he was, yeah, he
suffered in New York.

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:44.380
I mean, he was, it was not --
so he was happy to go back,

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:49.340
and he was very religious,
and he went to the church

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:53.580
in New York, and he found a lot
of other people the same spirit.

00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:56.620
And so, and you hear, so
you hear in this music,

00:39:56.620 --> 00:40:01.140
sometimes you forget that
this music is about chorus,

00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:04.430
church songs as well, and
you can hear them as well.

00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:06.580
Then, on the ship, he
wrote the Cello Concerto

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:10.400
and really looking
forward to his home.

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.700
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger:
But it's really great

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.000
to play this piece here.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.300
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener:
Yeah, it's wonderful.

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:15.600
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger:
It's incredible.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:16.900
[laughs]

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:18.200
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: We're
looking forward too.

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:19.500
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger: Yeah.

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:20.800
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Well,

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.100
just a quick [inaudible] does
someone have a couple questions

00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:23.400
for them before they
get -- yeah, oh, okay.

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:25.200
Yeah.

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:29.280
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:31.820
&gt;&gt; I was struck by your
comments about the contrast

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:34.210
between Slavic and
Germanic quartets.

00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:38.730
It strikes me, as an amateur
quartet player and listener

00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:42.700
to many recordings, that there
is an oral tradition as well

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:44.450
as a written tradition.

00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:48.720
And many of the works of Dvorak
and others came out of a period

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:51.000
of great national spirit.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.870
And when I listen to the
old recordings and when --

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:55.280
the first concert I saw

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:59.270
at the library was the
Smetana Trio here in '71 --

00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:04.280
there's a freedom with tempo
that's very interesting,

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:05.580
and I wonder if, you know,

00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:08.550
how a modern quartet
can acquire that spirit.

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:09.850
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: Yes.

00:41:09.850 --> 00:41:11.150
Yeah, absolutely right.

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:14.980
I, we have a very, very nice and
great colleague, [inaudible].

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:18.280
He's a viola player.

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:21.600
And he told me that he is
telling his students --

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:24.880
and now I'm telling the
same story to my students --

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:29.390
about tempo in German,
German tradition

00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:34.260
and in Romanic tradition, so
French, Italian tradition.

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:36.780
And he said he's always
telling his story.

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:38.450
He said, you know, in Germany,

00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:43.270
when the lights are
red, nobody is going.

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:46.310
It can be 2 o'clock
in the morning.

00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:50.410
No cars. The house
behind you is burning.

00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:52.920
A German is not crossing
the street.

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:57.800
It's red. [laughter] So
when Beethoven is writing a

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:00.140
crescendo, that means crescendo.

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:03.300
And when there's
written subito allegro

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:08.010
without an accelerando
before, it means subito.

00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:11.450
It means that, and the music is
working like that, only that.

00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:12.750
Of course, you can do it,

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:16.260
but then you are leaving
out the chromatic.

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:17.620
In France, it's different.

00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:20.770
When you are at the
-- how's it called?

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:25.350
-- the middle, [inaudible]
it's called,

00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:26.650
[inaudible] it's [inaudible],

00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:28.860
everybody is crossing
the streets is red.

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:30.160
Who cares?

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:33.250
It's traffic anyway, and
the cars go like that.

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:39.100
So nobody, so [inaudible]
it says it's more an advice,

00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:40.620
the light, you know.

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:42.870
Red is an advice, so better
you look when you, well,

00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:45.650
you can walk, but
you better look.

00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:46.950
The same with the music.

00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:50.860
When Ravel or Debussy is writing
a CD, it's more like, well,

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:53.430
depends, you know, how
far you reach there.

00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:57.300
So maybe it would be good
to a CD, but maybe you are

00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:59.500
so slow already, so
why shouldn't you go --

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:01.880
you will feel it,
my friend, you know.

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:04.410
And the music is
working like that.

00:43:04.410 --> 00:43:09.450
That's, and there we are coming
to mentality and language.

00:43:09.450 --> 00:43:11.670
Yeah, it's different,
and it's only a couple

00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:13.330
of kilometers away.

00:43:13.330 --> 00:43:15.390
It's another mentality.

00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:24.400
&gt;&gt; How total is, oh, how total
is your inclination to totally,

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:28.480
to avoid the historical
context in which a piece

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:31.500
or parts of a piece appear?

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:34.030
Take as an example
you are sight reading

00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:36.590
for the first time
the Smetana Quartet.

00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:38.100
You get to the last movement,

00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:43.740
and you have this intrusive
harmonic, prolonged harmonic.

00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:45.990
Would you stop and say,
what's he driving at?

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:47.500
What's he trying to do?

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:50.020
Or would you just go on
and do the best you can

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:56.640
with a very enigmatic kind of
a juncture in the movement?

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:57.940
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: Yeah.

00:43:57.940 --> 00:43:59.240
Yeah, yeah.

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:00.540
That's fantastic question.

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:02.110
We always discuss
about intonation.

00:44:02.110 --> 00:44:05.800
Well, we try to analyze,
you know, function wise,

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:07.650
what is the function
of a certain chord?

00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:09.930
And then, of course, we don't
play it [inaudible] sorry,

00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:11.230
this is getting very--

00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:12.530
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger:
By the way,

00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:14.010
we play from all our repertoire

00:44:14.010 --> 00:44:16.040
from score you will
see this evening.

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.340
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener:
So we always know--

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:19.770
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger: Every
piece we play from score--

00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:22.460
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: So we know
the voices, but we analyze,

00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:25.550
and we are big fans of
playing not [inaudible] well.

00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:28.170
Of course, there
are some music --

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:31.190
sorry, it's getting very
specific -- but we, sometimes,

00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:33.940
we have to play in,
like, in 12 music,

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:36.590
you have to play [inaudible],
but normally, we don't.

00:44:36.590 --> 00:44:40.720
So we always try to analyze
what kind of chord it is

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:42.930
because we are still listening.

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:46.560
Kind of probably everybody
is listening functional.

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:50.410
So we are listening to the
function of certain chords,

00:44:50.410 --> 00:44:54.150
and when it's getting, like
you said, murkily like Wagner,

00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:56.360
you know, the Tristan,
this Tristan chord,

00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:58.210
so what is it, you know?

00:44:58.210 --> 00:45:03.690
Then, we try kind of to figure
out what it is and coming close

00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:06.700
as possible to the
function we listen.

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:10.140
And then, we adjust our
intonation to that, yeah.

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:12.070
Is this what you meant, kind of?

00:45:12.070 --> 00:45:15.350
&gt;&gt; Well, and in a, he had
in mind his hearing loss,

00:45:15.350 --> 00:45:19.220
or so we are told, while the
announcer introduces the piece.

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:22.350
Maybe that's all
fictitious, but the fact

00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:28.050
that he was reminding the
listener of a painful juncture,

00:45:28.050 --> 00:45:30.980
milestone in his life
and his, you know,

00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:34.070
professional career
could be viewed

00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:35.460
as something important for--

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:37.200
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener:
Yes, of course.

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:40.230
It's, again, I think
this is a private thing.

00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:43.460
As I said, I mean, the music
stands for its own, but,

00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:46.820
of course, you feel that
there's something really

00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:48.340
traumatic happened.

00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:51.120
And, of course, I mean,
the title of the piece,

00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:56.060
"From My Life," is saying
everything, so you are really,

00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:59.840
somehow, you have to care
and, you know, so, I mean,

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:03.100
when you read the title, so you
can't say, okay, I don't care.

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:08.270
So a little bit, you are there,
but still, the music is not --

00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:11.200
or let's say the music
is not getting better

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:14.150
when you know exactly
what happened.

00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:18.580
The music is great already and
would be even if you don't know

00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:20.170
that it's biographical.

00:46:20.170 --> 00:46:22.900
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:25.200
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Yep.

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:35.000
&gt;&gt; You mentioned Walter
Levin as your teacher/coach.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.320
I had a small experience
with him myself, and I wanted

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.410
to bring him up because
he did just die in August.

00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:44.910
For, maybe name familiar to some
of the audience, but he was the,

00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:48.560
he was most known as the first
violinist of LaSalle Quartet

00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:52.100
that made many great recordings
on [inaudible] of Haydn,

00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:56.720
Beethoven, Mozart,
but also [inaudible].

00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:00.340
I went to a private
school, which would be

00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:02.160
about the equivalent
of a gymnasium.

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:05.010
I was say 15 in a
string ensemble.

00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:07.000
The headmaster of our school
happened to be friends

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.730
with Walter Levin, so [laughs]
he got him to come to campus

00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:11.570
and coach us in some Mozart.

00:47:11.570 --> 00:47:13.130
It was very brief.

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:16.400
This guy was tough.

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:18.050
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: Yeah.

00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:20.190
&gt;&gt; [laughter] And kind
of like Toscanini was

00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:21.490
with the orchestra.

00:47:21.490 --> 00:47:23.430
I mean, this is how he was
with the string quartet.

00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:26.390
And because he cared so
much about the music.

00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:29.110
And he maybe didn't worry if he
said something a little gruff

00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:31.910
or rough to the musicians
because it was

00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:33.210
in service to the music.

00:47:33.210 --> 00:47:36.320
And if he said, if you played
something and he said, well,

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:38.840
that wasn't bad, that was
like the highest praise.

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:40.330
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:41.630
&gt;&gt; [laughter] So I just wondered

00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:43.920
if you had maybe
a few more stories

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:46.780
about what you got from him.

00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:49.170
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: What,
have some anecdotes about him?

00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:50.470
&gt;&gt; One or two.

00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:51.890
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: Well,
I remembered it's always,

00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:58.520
I remember 1 scene -- okay, the
older he got, he got more mild.

00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:04.180
So, but when I started
studying with him, for example,

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:07.050
he said to a colleague of mine,
I mean, we were all listening

00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:10.600
to the lessons, so the
hole was always full

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:11.990
when he was teaching.

00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:15.230
And so I remember first he was
saying to a colleague of mine,

00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:18.140
to another cellist,
wow, you play wonderful.

00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:22.790
And after that, he was
always criticizing him.

00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:26.240
So first, he gave him a
sweet, and from then on,

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:28.670
he was keeping it
-- and one time,

00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:30.160
what's the name of his wife?

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:31.460
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger: Evi.

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:32.760
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: Evi.

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:37.310
Evi was, Evi, his wife, was very
often with him while teaching.

00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:41.230
And I remember once he said,
turned around and said to Evi,

00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:44.210
you know, it's been a while
since someone cried here

00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:46.560
on the stage, you know.

00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:51.520
So he was really, sometimes
really, really hard.

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:53.240
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger: But
he had also very nice,

00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:54.820
a little boy side.

00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:56.910
I was a little bit
closer to him sometimes,

00:48:56.910 --> 00:49:02.030
and I have some letters with him
where he wrote me very nice also

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:04.280
about his time during
the World War.

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:05.580
I have at home.

00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:06.880
I'm very proud.

00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:11.520
[laughs] And sometimes,
he, one time,

00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:17.800
he said that he had bad dreams
that he cannot play violin.

00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:21.520
So I think he was
also very angry.

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:24.620
And this was where
the both sides --

00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:28.770
this, very hard teacher, and on
the other side, the little boy.

00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:30.070
And so--

00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:31.370
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener:
Yeah, and he was--

00:49:31.370 --> 00:49:32.670
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger:
[laughs] It's very impressive.

00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:33.970
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: Boy like.

00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:35.270
He was fascinated by tennis.

00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:37.640
I remember when we had
lessons during Wimbledon

00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:40.900
or Australian Open, he
wasn't able to teach.

00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:44.530
So he said, well, guys, I care
a lot about [inaudible] quartet,

00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:46.300
but, you know, now
Federer is playing.

00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:48.590
I have to go.

00:49:48.590 --> 00:49:51.710
He's, and then he came back and
said, I wish I could play violin

00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:53.410
like Federer is playing tennis.

00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:56.850
He thought Federer was a genius
when Federer came up first.

00:49:56.850 --> 00:49:59.160
So, because of this
elegant style, you know,

00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:01.420
not really just power,
power play,

00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:03.040
but really elegant playing.

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:05.630
So, yeah. He had
this side as well,

00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:10.600
and he always knew he was
kind of this, at home,

00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:12.490
it was like quartet headquarter.

00:50:12.490 --> 00:50:14.670
He knew exactly -- when
he was getting older --

00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:17.630
he knew exactly, or
especially his wife,

00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:22.820
if he was knowing exactly
on the map worldwide

00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:26.180
where all his quartets
were, you know, touring.

00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:29.880
So I, once, we had a concert in
south of Germany, Badenweiler,

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:35.590
a famous place for quartets when
LaSalle played a lot of times.

00:50:35.590 --> 00:50:38.120
And [inaudible] we were
doing I think [inaudible]

00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:40.000
about [inaudible] quartet.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:44.430
And afterwards, we had a dinner
together, and I was sitting next

00:50:44.430 --> 00:50:46.550
to Evi, and Evi was
telling me, [inaudible] is

00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:51.440
in Budapest tonight, and I
think this quartet is in Sydney,

00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:53.360
and this one is in
London tonight.

00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:58.690
They know exactly kind of
where the fleet [laughs] is.

00:50:58.690 --> 00:51:02.530
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger: But also,
on this place, I heard [laughs]

00:51:02.530 --> 00:51:05.690
when these both, these
couple were in a room, well,

00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:07.420
there were old wallpapers

00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:10.610
and [inaudible] old programs
from Amadeus Quartet.

00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:14.800
And Evi said to [inaudible],
oh, look, these bad programs.

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:20.370
[laughs] Without Second
Viennese School or something.

00:51:20.370 --> 00:51:21.670
So--

00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:23.090
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: And
maybe last thing, yes,

00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:25.210
it's nice to remember
him, actually.

00:51:25.210 --> 00:51:26.880
&gt;&gt; Annette Reisinger:
Yeah, he was a great--

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:29.040
&gt;&gt; Matthias Diener: And he
was nervous behind the stage.

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:32.510
I remember that when we
played at [inaudible] Festival

00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:36.000
when we were very young at
this and in the first years,

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.300
during the first years.

00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:38.600
He came, we had a
master class with him,

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:41.550
and he came behind stage
and said, did you tune?

00:51:41.550 --> 00:51:42.850
Did you tune?

00:51:42.850 --> 00:51:45.440
[laughs] We said, yes, we are
not doing it for the first time.

00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:46.740
We tuned, really.

00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:52.420
And he was so nervous
for us, kind of, yeah.

00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:53.720
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Well,
thank you so much

00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:57.160
for sharing these fond
memories, interesting ones.
