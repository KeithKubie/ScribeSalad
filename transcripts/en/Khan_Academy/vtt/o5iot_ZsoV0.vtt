00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.536
Male: What I want to do in
this video is introduce you

00:00:02.536 --> 00:00:05.607
to the idea of a consumption function.

00:00:05.607 --> 00:00:07.141
It's a very simple idea.

00:00:07.141 --> 00:00:09.133
It's really just the notion that income,

00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:11.338
income in aggregate in an economy

00:00:11.338 --> 00:00:17.470
can drive consumption in
aggregate in an economy.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.729
Just to make things
tangible, I will construct

00:00:19.729 --> 00:00:24.141
a consumption function for
a hypothetical economy,

00:00:24.141 --> 00:00:27.037
and we can debate whether we
can construct a better one.

00:00:27.037 --> 00:00:29.136
All the numbers don't have to be exactly

00:00:29.136 --> 00:00:30.647
what I'm about to do, but this is just

00:00:30.647 --> 00:00:32.073
to make things concrete in your mind.

00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:33.875
Maybe we have a hypothetical economy

00:00:33.875 --> 00:00:36.334
where consumption is
going to be equal to ...

00:00:36.334 --> 00:00:38.469
well, maybe there's some
base level of consumption

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:41.140
even if there's no aggregate
income in our economy.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.959
It's hard to image, but
let's say there isn't.

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:44.399
There will still be consumption.

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.472
Maybe people can do it by
digging into their savings.

00:00:47.472 --> 00:00:49.138
They're essentially using resources

00:00:49.138 --> 00:00:51.407
that they've already
accumulated in some way.

00:00:51.407 --> 00:00:53.372
Let's say that base level of consumption,

00:00:53.372 --> 00:00:55.803
let's call that 500.

00:00:55.803 --> 00:00:58.619
It could be billions of
dollars or gold coins

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:01.005
or clamshells or whatever the unit

00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:03.375
of measuring economic
activity is in our economy.

00:01:03.375 --> 00:01:06.627
That's our base level of consumption.

00:01:06.627 --> 00:01:10.919
Then let's say if there
is some aggregate income,

00:01:10.919 --> 00:01:12.882
people will spend 60% of it.

00:01:12.882 --> 00:01:14.725
I'm just picking these
numbers somewhat arbitrarily.

00:01:14.725 --> 00:01:17.729
Let's say if there's some above and beyond

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.619
the base level, they're going to spend 0.6

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.613
of any aggregate income they have.

00:01:22.613 --> 00:01:23.998
Actually, to be a little
bit more particular,

00:01:23.998 --> 00:01:27.456
I'll write not just income,
I'll write disposable income.

00:01:27.456 --> 00:01:30.427
I'll want to do that in a different color.

00:01:30.427 --> 00:01:32.744
They will ... that's
not a different color.

00:01:32.744 --> 00:01:34.696
Above and beyond the base level,

00:01:34.696 --> 00:01:40.916
they'll spend 60% of
their disposable income.

00:01:40.916 --> 00:01:44.285
I make the distinction,
just to clarify our model,

00:01:44.285 --> 00:01:46.209
between income and disposable income

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:49.658
because all of the aggregate
income in an economy

00:01:49.658 --> 00:01:54.047
does not end up in consumers' pockets.

00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:56.332
Just for a simplification, you might say,

00:01:56.332 --> 00:01:58.137
"Yeah, some of it ends
up in firms' pockets,"

00:01:58.137 --> 00:01:59.296
but the firms, at the end of the day,

00:01:59.296 --> 00:02:01.088
are owned by individuals, so it can end up

00:02:01.088 --> 00:02:03.462
in individuals' or consumers' pockets.

00:02:03.462 --> 00:02:07.521
But some of it goes off to the government.

00:02:07.521 --> 00:02:09.396
When you think about
income, and if you spend

00:02:09.396 --> 00:02:11.545
any time looking at
your pay stub this will

00:02:11.545 --> 00:02:13.939
become familiar to you,
you have your income

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:15.667
but you don't end up
with all of that in your

00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:17.067
checking account or your pocket

00:02:17.067 --> 00:02:18.268
or your savings account.

00:02:18.268 --> 00:02:21.662
A good fraction of that
is taken out for taxes.

00:02:21.662 --> 00:02:23.665
What you have left over when you subtract

00:02:23.665 --> 00:02:31.396
taxes out of income, that
is your disposable income.

00:02:31.396 --> 00:02:33.401
That's why I write this
here because that's actually

00:02:33.401 --> 00:02:34.547
a more reasonable thing to say.

00:02:34.547 --> 00:02:37.542
People will spend 60% of
their disposable income.

00:02:37.542 --> 00:02:39.326
They obviously can't spend
a fraction of stuff that

00:02:39.326 --> 00:02:42.408
they don't have, the stuff
that's taken out for taxes.

00:02:42.408 --> 00:02:44.328
Just to visualize this, we can draw it.

00:02:44.328 --> 00:02:45.325
This will be a line.

00:02:45.325 --> 00:02:48.129
This might ring a bell from
your early algebra days.

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.183
Just the variables are different.

00:02:50.183 --> 00:02:52.594
Instead of a y, we have a c,

00:02:52.594 --> 00:02:54.211
but that's still the dependent variable.

00:02:54.211 --> 00:02:56.208
It's a function of disposable income.

00:02:56.208 --> 00:02:59.213
In algebra you'll often call
this the independent variable.

00:02:59.213 --> 00:03:01.547
The most typical variable is x.

00:03:01.547 --> 00:03:03.462
It's really the same idea over here.

00:03:03.462 --> 00:03:07.516
Let me draw this a little bit neater.

00:03:07.516 --> 00:03:11.324
We can graph this, what's
essentially going to be a line.

00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:12.259
It doesn't have to be a line.

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:13.885
We just constructed a consumption function

00:03:13.885 --> 00:03:15.661
that happens to be a line.

00:03:15.661 --> 00:03:19.496
This is consumption right over
here in the vertical axis.

00:03:19.496 --> 00:03:21.008
That could be in billions of dollars

00:03:21.008 --> 00:03:22.858
or clamshells or whatever else.

00:03:22.858 --> 00:03:31.469
Then right over here we
have disposable income.

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:34.393
If there is zero disposable income,

00:03:34.393 --> 00:03:38.833
maybe I'll draw a little table over here.

00:03:38.833 --> 00:03:41.060
This is I'll call it disposable income

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.197
and this is consumption.

00:03:42.197 --> 00:03:44.695
If there's zero disposable income,

00:03:44.695 --> 00:03:46.459
then this whole term right over here is 0.

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.433
Then you have 500 billion dollars,

00:03:49.433 --> 00:03:52.392
or whatever our units
are, of base consumption.

00:03:52.392 --> 00:03:56.546
This would correspond to
this point right over here.

00:03:56.546 --> 00:03:59.138
In the horizontal axis
you don't move at all

00:03:59.138 --> 00:04:00.222
because this is 0.

00:04:00.222 --> 00:04:02.073
Vertical axis is 500.

00:04:02.073 --> 00:04:03.742
So you have 500.

00:04:03.742 --> 00:04:09.800
Let's say disposable income is 1,000

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.931
whatever our units are.

00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:11.996
So this is 500.

00:04:11.996 --> 00:04:14.804
Let's say this is 1,000
billion clamshells.

00:04:14.804 --> 00:04:16.745
This could be in billions of clamshells.

00:04:16.745 --> 00:04:18.204
I don't want to keep having to say that

00:04:18.204 --> 00:04:19.498
over and over again.

00:04:19.498 --> 00:04:21.464
What is our consumption
going to be in our units?

00:04:21.464 --> 00:04:24.488
Our consumption is going to be equal to

00:04:24.488 --> 00:04:30.329
500 + 0.6 x 1,000 which is equal to

00:04:30.329 --> 00:04:35.536
500 + 600 which is equal to 1,100.

00:04:35.536 --> 00:04:39.199
That would correspond,
this right over here,

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.906
would correspond to; so 1,000,

00:04:42.906 --> 00:04:44.599
so this might be 1,000 on this axis

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:47.666
so this would be 1,100 to
this point right over here.

00:04:47.666 --> 00:04:54.125
That would be the
coordinate: 1,000; 1,100.

00:04:54.125 --> 00:04:55.554
This is a line.

00:04:55.554 --> 00:04:56.801
Two points make a line.

00:04:56.801 --> 00:05:01.071
In this particular case we have

00:05:01.071 --> 00:05:03.136
a consumption function that looks

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:06.001
something like this.

00:05:06.001 --> 00:05:07.345
We picked two points to draw it.

00:05:07.345 --> 00:05:08.794
If you remember a little
bit of your slope,

00:05:08.794 --> 00:05:11.470
you could view this as your y intercept,

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.152
or in this case your c intercept,

00:05:13.152 --> 00:05:15.299
and that your slope would be the .6,

00:05:15.299 --> 00:05:17.213
and we'll talk more about
that in future videos

00:05:17.213 --> 00:05:18.886
when we dig into the marginal propensity

00:05:18.886 --> 00:05:20.739
to consume a little bit more.

00:05:20.739 --> 00:05:22.136
But the one thing I just want to highlight

00:05:22.136 --> 00:05:23.479
is it's a very simple idea.

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:26.218
This does not have to be
the consumption function.

00:05:26.218 --> 00:05:28.385
The consumption functions
that we tend to study

00:05:28.385 --> 00:05:31.058
in introductory economics
classes will look like this.

00:05:31.058 --> 00:05:33.225
It will be a line that
has some intersection,

00:05:33.225 --> 00:05:34.804
some base level of consumption.

00:05:34.804 --> 00:05:36.810
But one could argue it
might be very different.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.136
Maybe the consumption
function looks like this.

00:05:39.136 --> 00:05:41.737
Maybe when income is low,

00:05:41.737 --> 00:05:44.044
for every incremental dollar of income,

00:05:44.044 --> 00:05:47.803
people are probably going to spend a lot.

00:05:47.803 --> 00:05:49.744
As they become richer
and richer and richer,

00:05:49.744 --> 00:05:51.133
as their income goes higher and higher,

00:05:51.133 --> 00:05:52.676
they're going to spend less and less

00:05:52.676 --> 00:05:54.805
a fraction of their disposable income.

00:05:54.805 --> 00:05:56.381
Essentially what I'm describing here

00:05:56.381 --> 00:05:58.609
is a marginal propensity
to consume changes.

00:05:58.609 --> 00:06:00.640
In our first model, we had a very basic

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.284
marginal propensity to consume.

00:06:02.284 --> 00:06:03.381
It was constant.

00:06:03.381 --> 00:06:07.672
For every incremental
dollar, .6 of that got spent.

00:06:07.672 --> 00:06:09.667
So we had a marginal propensity to consume

00:06:09.667 --> 00:06:13.141
that was constant of 0.6.

00:06:13.141 --> 00:06:15.057
Marginal propensity to consume.

00:06:15.057 --> 00:06:16.636
But, you could argue, that maybe a more

00:06:16.636 --> 00:06:18.742
complex model is justified.

00:06:18.742 --> 00:06:20.923
That when you have a very high marginal

00:06:20.923 --> 00:06:23.591
propensity to consume, when
people have very little

00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:25.407
because they have a very
low standard of living,

00:06:25.407 --> 00:06:27.662
they really want to just
get a little bit more

00:06:27.662 --> 00:06:29.555
just so they can live a decent life,

00:06:29.555 --> 00:06:31.746
but as they get more and
more income they say,

00:06:31.746 --> 00:06:34.462
"Hey, I'm starting to max
out my standard of living,

00:06:34.462 --> 00:06:38.462
"I'll save more and more
of it for a rainy day."
