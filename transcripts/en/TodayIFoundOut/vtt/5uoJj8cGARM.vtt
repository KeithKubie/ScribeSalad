00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.860
The Dogs Aboard the Titanic

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.160
On April 15, 1912, the legendary, ill-fated
ship RMS Titanic sank.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.060
It remains, to this day, the most famous disaster
in maritime history.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.919
There were approximately 2,223 passengers
aboard the ship, of which 1,502 perished.

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:26.710
(Some sources site the figures at 2,228, with
1,503 dying.)

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.300
Besides humans, a dozen dogs were aboard the
ship on its luckless maiden voyage.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.000
Just three survived.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.650
How were three dogs saved in lifeboats when
there wasn’t enough room for all the human

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:38.780
passengers?

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.710
The three dogs that survived the Titanic disaster
were all extremely small.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.080
The dogs were so small, it is probable that
no one even noticed them when they were carried

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.500
aboard the lifeboats.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.980
Two of the dogs were Pomeranians, the third
was a Pekinese.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.829
One little Pomeranian was named “Lady”
and was bought by Titanic passenger Miss Margaret

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:57.940
Hayes in Paris.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.850
“Lady” shared a cabin with Miss Hayes
and was wrapped in a blanket and carried onto

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.420
a lifeboat by her when the order was given
to evacuate.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.420
The fabulously wealthy family the Rothschilds
owned the other Pomeranian that survived.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.220
The Pekinese was named “Sun Yat-Sen” and
was brought on board by the Harper family

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.290
(of the New York publishing firm Harpers &amp; Row.)-
only first class passengers had dogs aboard.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.190
One family even received an insurance payment
in the amount of $300 (about $7000 today)

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.330
for their two dogs that didn’t survive the
sinking of the ship.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.320
Wealthy passenger William Carter was traveling
with his wife, Lucille, and two children.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.010
Their daughter Lucy’s King Charles Spaniel
was insured for $100 and their son Billy’s

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.990
Airdale for $200.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.159
The children begged to take the dogs when
evacuating, but Carter insisted they were

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.740
too big and assured his distraught children
that their dogs would be fine in the ship’s

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.740
kennel…

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.740
LIES!!!

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.869
When the dogs perished, the insurance company
made good on both claims.

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.470
As for the other dogs aboard, those whose
names are known include world-famous millionaire

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.010
John Jacob Astor’s Airdale, “Kitty”.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.579
A woman named Helen Bishop brought a Fox Terrier
named “Dog”.

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:07.939
(How original.)

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.200
Passenger Robert Daniel brought “Gamin De
Pycombe”, his French Bulldog.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.020
There were several other dogs aboard whose
names are not known.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.990
Although a few of canine passengers shared
a cabin with their owners, a majority were

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.230
kept in the ship’s kennel and were cared
for by the Titanic’s crew members.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.650
One particularly sad story involved a Great
Dane owned by 50-year-old Elizabeth Isham.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.130
Miss Isham visited her dog at the ship’s
kennel daily.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.930
When she was evacuating, she asked to take
the dog with her.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.050
When she was told the dog was too large, she
refused to leave the ship without him and

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.720
got out of her lifeboat.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.580
Several days later, the body of an elderly
woman clutching a large dog was spotted by

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.010
the recovery ship Mackay Bennet, and dinghies
were dispatched to round up the bodies of

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.280
the woman and the animal.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.069
Eyewitness accounts and the ship’s log confirm
the sighting and recovery.

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.430
The body of the woman recovered is assumed
to be that of Miss Isham, though this was

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.260
not verified by any other means than noting
the type of dog and putting the story of her

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.739
refusal to leave the ship together with the
fact that they found a woman’s body with

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:17.010
the dead dog.
