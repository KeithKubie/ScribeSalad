[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.350
SPEAKER: So today we are
so lucky to have Andrea

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.130
Nguyen of "The Pho Cookbook."

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.250
Please join me in
welcoming her to Google.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.962
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.234
And with that,
please take it away.

00:00:21.234 --> 00:00:22.275
ANDREA NGUYEN: All right.

00:00:22.275 --> 00:00:23.380
Thank you so much.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.960
We've got a few
extra seats around

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.960
if anybody wants to sit down and
maybe get a better view of what

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.340
I'm going to be working on.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.080
SPEAKER: And feel
free to move stools.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.850
Make yourself at home.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.280
ANDREA NGUYEN: This is
your kitchen space today.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.370
And like with a lot of
classes in teaching--

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.160
I'm a professional cookbook
author and cooking teacher

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.460
and consultant.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.910
And so a lot of what
I do is help people

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.115
become better home
cooks, because I

00:00:53.115 --> 00:00:55.230
am a professional home cook.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.610
I'm not a restaurant chef.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.770
So I'm always
thinking of how can I

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.340
help home cooks figure
out ways to make foods

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.850
that they may or may not be
familiar with, and really

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.050
up their game?

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.470
So "The Pho Cookbook"
is my fifth cookbook.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.130
And I'm Vietnamese by heritage.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.660
I was born in Vietnam.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.830
And when my family
fled Vietnam in 1975,

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.340
we brought a lot of
our food memories

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.890
with us, because for
a family of seven,

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.950
we only had two
little suitcases.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.410
So imagine carrying
like two backpacks

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.250
worth of your belongings
and going to another country

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.690
to start over.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.270
And so what did we have but the
flavors that my parents wanted

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.990
to recreate.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.530
And they were people in
their forties with five kids.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.370
And so, you know, we weren't
living near a Pho shop.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.010
We couldn't walk out and
get Pho like we used to.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.060
So they ended up making a
lot of the food at home.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.940
And initially we
had to cook a lot

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.650
from an American supermarket,
which back in 1979--

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.710
and some of you may be
old enough to remember--

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.810
it was really sad.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.520
Soy sauce, bad rice,
yucky vegetables.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.470
A lot of that has changed.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.560
And with "The Pho Cookbook,"
because a lot of people

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.820
sense it's like, oh!

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.020
I can't make pho.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.196
I've had people tell
me that it takes hours!

00:02:25.196 --> 00:02:26.820
I've even had Vietnamese
people tell me

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.500
that their parents
tell them, oh my God!

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.750
It takes like an
overnight simmer.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.540
And pho shop owners will say,
I brewed this pho for 18 hours.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.010
Well, when you're making pho at
home for as few as two people

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.460
or up to eight people,
you can really, really

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.250
spend a lot less time, because
you're small batching it.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.220
You're making
artisanal pho at home.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.130
So you don't have to
spend that much time.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.410
So when you work your
way through the book,

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.690
you'll notice that
at the front part

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.940
there is this thing
called a pho manual.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.650
And it explains like 99% of
what I know about making pho.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.070
And the extra 1% is very
boring and distracting.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.650
So I left that out.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.180
For example, like
one man told me

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.969
he had to scrape the bones
off until his knuckles bled

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:15.510
or something.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.174
And I was like, I'm not
putting that in the book.

00:03:19.174 --> 00:03:21.090
I was just like, he said
it's a waste of time.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.050
And I thought, well, yeah.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.620
I think so.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.020
And then after the
pho manual, there's

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.850
a chapter called master pho.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.670
And what it offers are
different ways to make pho.

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.820
So you can spend as
little as 40 minutes

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.520
doctoring up canned broth.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:45.300
So if you could do me a favor
and hand me that can of broth--

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.540
this is audience
participation time.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.425
And I'm not doing any
product placement.

00:03:50.425 --> 00:03:51.300
But stuff like this--

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.040
Swanson's chicken broth.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.890
Or if you're shopping at
Whole Foods, then by all

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.130
means the Whole Foods
365 broth is really good.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.950
You want sort of a
higher sodium broth.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.110
And so there are three
different recipes.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.310
40 minutes, with grocery stores
ingredients like this, and then

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.560
with like Annie Chun noodles--

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.890
if you're shopping at a regular
market, it's very good--

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:14.790
you can have pho.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.240
Chicken, vegetable, or beef.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.370
There is another
method of making pho

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.510
using a pressure cooker.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.670
How many of you own
pressure cookers?

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:24.570
The instant pot.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.952
How many are you
instant potters?

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.896
So you can spend like
an hour and a half,

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:33.770
if you're using an
instant pot, please reduce

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.490
the amount of water by one cup.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.990
OK?

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.470
Just saying that,
because the instant pot

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.100
has this maximum fill
line, as you know.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.540
And you can go up to that point.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.500
And it also retains pressure
for a very, very long time.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.020
So you can kind of save
yourself a little time.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.350
And it's not venting.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.330
So you should get
the same quantity

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.580
with one cup less water.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.830
Just saying.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.920
If you're using something like
a pressure cooker to make pho,

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.580
you can do it in an hour and
a half from beginning to end.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:13.280
And you can also then
freeze your broth.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.900
And there are
instructions on how

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.260
to do that so that you could
have what I call the pho

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.740
bank at your disposal.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.000
My mother now lives
off my frozen pho bank.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.930
She's 82.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.500
She gets to rest.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.990
But anyway.

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.320
And then the last
method of making pho

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.970
is with an old school simmer.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.500
That's where you have--

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.620
it's a weekend project.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.120
OK.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.630
Pressure cooker pho,
that's a weeknight project.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.530
You can make weekend
pho on a weeknight.

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.760
Doctoring up quick pho
from using canned broth.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.850
That could be like a lunchtime
thing, or a weeknight thing.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.270
But when you have time,
brew from scratch.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.500
And what we're going to
have serving you here today

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:10.770
is a vegan beef version of pho.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:18.650
But I also wanted to talk
about making classic beef pho

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.110
old school using a stockpot.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.129
So we're talking then like four
or five hours worth of time.

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:25.170
But most of it's passive.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.770
You can text.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:26.400
You can work.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.920
You can take your dog on a walk.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.600
Whatever.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.270
And one of the first
things that you

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.000
want to start doing
when you're making pho--

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.060
and regardless of
different kinds.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.560
And what I'm going
to talk about applies

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.440
to pho across the board.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.150
The aromatics.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.780
Basically we're talking
onion and ginger.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.640
Get yourself some plump ginger.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.110
And in my recipes
I'll say chubby.

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.490
Chubby, you know, like the
size of your big toe chubby.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.890
And I think we all get a
sense of what that means.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.210
If you're using a scale--

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.910
and a scale unfortunately
never lies--

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.170
one inch of ginger is
approximately one ounce.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.990
So you'll find
sometimes like, whoa,

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:12.740
that ginger looks like
it's really chubby.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.900
But because it's
got like maybe--

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.510
it's just really
dense or too watery.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.050
But you really get
up to that one ounce

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.850
for that gingery quality.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:25.670
And then you want
to get that going.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:30.050
Traditionally we would
put that on a brazier.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.020
You can use onion, yellow onion.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.650
Or you can also use a shallot.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:41.240
So in Vietnam, you and I
would be squatting next

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:46.190
to a charcoal brazier, because
we don't have indoor grills.

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.960
We don't have ovens that we
could use a broiler element.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.170
We don't have gas
stoves, a lot of us.

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:54.320
But we do have grills.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.610
You can use an indoor grill.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:59.770
At home I have a gas range.

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:02.850
So I'm just going to put
it directly on the grill.

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:06.860
So this business about
charring the aromatics.

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:08.270
What is it?

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:11.840
I think it is the
only aspect of pho

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.720
that the Vietnamese really
borrowed from the French

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.270
in terms of culinary technique.

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:21.170
There's a lot of
discussion about oh, pho

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:26.390
comes from France because it
sounds like a French word, pho.

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:29.810
Like pot-au-feu, like fire.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:32.539
Well, the French
were in Vietnam when

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:36.360
pho developed, which was in the
early part of the 20th century.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:40.490
So we're talking in
late 1800s, early 1900s

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:41.850
in the northern part of Vietnam.

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:44.480
So Vietnam is this
very long country.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.680
Hanoi's up here.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.170
And this is where all the
pho action was happening.

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:49.640
And the French were around.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.250
And they like their beef.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:55.190
So they were slaughtering
a lot of cows.

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:56.990
And they left the scraps--

00:08:56.990 --> 00:09:02.640
things like bones.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.140
OK.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.970
So these are like bones.

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:09.020
I'm going to-- it's
coming from here.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.820
OK.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:12.770
Sometimes they're
called femur bones.

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:13.730
So marrow bones.

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:15.920
I'm just going to pass these
around so that you get a sense.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.378
A lot of times like
with cookbooks,

00:09:17.378 --> 00:09:19.460
they don't explain what
things look like to you.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:22.460
And they're like, oh, just
go out and get a femur bone.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:25.340
And you're like, what
does that look like?

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.700
That is a marrow
bone or a femur bone.

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:33.040
And if it happens to
include the socket,

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.170
that's called a knuckle bone.

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:40.390
So just remember our biology
classes, our skeletons

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.140
and stuff.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:46.600
And I'm going to talk while
I'm doing some of this stuff.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.940
The other thing is sometimes
there are neck bones.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.520
So if someone can
pass that along there.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.910
I have my certain range, you
guys, that I get to move into.

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:58.390
But like I-- yes, please.

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.450
Google makes pho and
cooks other things

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:03.610
with these amazing,
amazing bones.

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:07.300
So as a home cook, you are not
going to be accessing bones

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.080
like this.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.210
And please, cutting
them is not something

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.340
you want to try at home.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:16.210
It requires a saw like a
butcher saw, like a band saw.

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:18.310
And at markets
like Asian markets,

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:19.810
you'll see that
they're running them

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:22.660
through the saws like this.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:27.400
But this is like an entire
cervical spine of the cow.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.070
And so you can
blend bones-- marrow

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:32.470
bones, knuckle
bones, neck bones.

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:35.800
Neck bones contribute
meaty flavor.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.870
Marrow bones contribute fat.

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:42.157
Knuckle bones contribute
sort of like some tendons.

00:10:42.157 --> 00:10:44.740
For all of you who like tendon,
you can just scrape the tendon

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.390
off the knuckle bones.

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:48.520
Who needs to go buy tendon?

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.830
That's what a pho shop does.

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.030
You're not opening a pho shop.

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:55.700
If you were, you wouldn't
be working at Google.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:56.200
So.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.550
SPEAKER: I don't know.

00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:00.996
Some entrepreneurial
Googlers out there.

00:11:00.996 --> 00:11:02.840
It's not a conflict of interest.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:03.590
ANDREA NGUYEN: No.

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:04.510
No.

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:07.105
But you've got pho shops
going on here on the campus.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.460
There are a lot of
impurities in these bones

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:13.670
that you're dealing with.

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:15.580
So oftentimes when I'm
making pho at home,

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:20.080
I've got my aromatics
going on one burner.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:24.310
And at the same
time, I do this thing

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:27.220
where I parboil the bones.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:30.910
So what happens is I blanch--

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:33.820
parboiling means you're
putting something in water.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.860
And then you're bringing
it up to a boil.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:37.690
And then you're going
to turn off the heat.

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:39.010
What does that do?

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:41.920
That is called scum.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:45.940
It is not going to do anything
to contribute to your broth

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:47.830
but to dirty it up.

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:48.700
No bueno.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.880
We do not-- think of this
like the scuzzy stuff

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.800
that you see in the ocean.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:57.190
And you're like, I do not
want to wade into that.

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:59.800
This is not what you
want in your broth.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:05.880
And when you do this, I have
to operate an induction burner

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.304
while I'm talking.

00:12:07.304 --> 00:12:08.220
SPEAKER: It's a trick.

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:08.928
That whole thing.

00:12:08.928 --> 00:12:10.200
I can never get it to work.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.600
It's not just you.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.360
ANDREA NGUYEN: So typically,
I'll bring this to a boil,

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.190
let it go for a little bit.

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:20.460
And then I will take
it over to the sink

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:21.840
and then just dump it out.

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:29.420
And what this allows
me to do is very,

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:37.600
very easily remove any kind of
scuzziness that would otherwise

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:43.300
really cloud up my broth.

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.234
And you would be
using a lot more bones

00:12:45.234 --> 00:12:46.150
than what I have here.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:55.160
But I wanted you to see
that once that you do this,

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.050
you brew your broth, and
number one, the flavor

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:00.390
is not going to be off
because of the bones.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:04.940
There.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:06.430
You can pass it around
if you guys can see

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:07.850
what blanched bones looks like.

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:09.460
But it's a lot cleaner.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:11.650
And same thing with chicken.

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:14.470
Just parboil them, dump
it out, spray it down.

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:17.290
This is what that sprayer is
really good for in your sink.

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:19.870
They don't tell you that
when you buy your house

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:21.640
or buy a new
kitchen faucet sink.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.170
But that's what you're doing.

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:24.300
And yes.

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.500
AUDIENCE: How long do
you parboil them for?

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.000
ANDREA NGUYEN: Two
to three minutes.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:28.600
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:28.840
ANDREA NGUYEN: Yeah.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.970
I did it less because
these bones, were just

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:31.930
like two of them.

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:33.640
And I had them sitting around.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.070
But parboiling, once
you strain the broth,

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:39.260
man, it is really
lovely and clear.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:44.410
So with aromatics, so
you're going to let

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:49.240
them go until they
start blackening.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.570
And you're through with
the blackening when

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:55.420
you're looking about like this.

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:58.540
It's a little CSI-looking.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:59.920
Right?

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:06.230
But you're looking
to char the outside.

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:10.930
You're not looking to cook
the entire thing, because you

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:12.370
want some of that rawness.

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:14.440
All this charring
does is convert

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:19.390
some of the harsher
qualities of the onion

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:24.690
and the ginger or the
shallot to a sweet level.

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:29.980
And that imparts this beautiful
sweetness to the broth.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:32.470
So take your time to do that
when you're doing old school.

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:35.110
If you're pressure cooking
it, what I found, my friends,

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:37.000
is that it does not matter.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.620
Skip the charring.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:40.540
Because the pressure
cooker, it's

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:44.110
like the Beavis and
Butt-head of appliances,

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:46.420
because it's literally
cooking under pressure.

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.640
It's got this gasket that
goes on really, really

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.810
tight on the top.

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:50.790
And it's like, uh!

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:51.550
Like this.

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:54.190
There is nowhere for
that steam to escape.

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:57.070
Whereas in a regular
pot, we can go ahead

00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:58.900
and let the steam escape.

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:02.080
Whether the lid's on or not,
there is steam escaping.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.690
But in a pressure cooker,
that steam's going nowhere.

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:07.300
So it moves really fast
and it moves really hot.

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:10.900
So it's expressing
flavors a lot more rapidly

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:12.670
and with more force.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:15.580
As a result, it wipes
out all the nuances

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.380
that you would
get in doing this.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.000
So there's a
technique that I have

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.460
in preparing the pressure cooker
pho where you get to skip this.

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:25.330
Just so that you know,
so that you don't always

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.420
have to do the same methods.

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:31.570
There are different
work-arounds.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:34.660
And so once that you
get the aromatics

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:38.650
to this level, what
you're going to do

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:40.360
is you're going to peel it.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:47.560
And I oftentimes give it
a little rinse under water

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.830
to soften the skin.

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:52.420
I'm just gonna turn that off.

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:57.300
And then you can use a peeler.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.600
Or you can use a knife.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:04.540
But you want to get all
of that brownness off.

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:11.641
And let's see if I can
use one of these guys.

00:16:11.641 --> 00:16:12.140
Yeah.

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:12.681
Look at that.

00:16:12.681 --> 00:16:15.380
You want to get that
stuff off of there.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.450
And if you're standing
over your sink,

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:20.180
it's really smart to do this
while you're over your sink.

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:24.700
Then you can just let the
stuff drop right in there.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.040
But you want to get
all of the charred bits

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:31.532
off, because that
will impart color.

00:16:31.532 --> 00:16:32.740
Is that what you were saying?

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:33.710
AUDIENCE: I said,
it smells good.

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:34.835
ANDREA NGUYEN: Oh,
it smells good.

00:16:34.835 --> 00:16:36.293
You're like, it
smells really good.

00:16:36.293 --> 00:16:37.690
And I'm hungry.

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:40.510
I wish she would just hasten up.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:43.870
Pho is all about
patience, my dear.

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:44.660
No, it is.

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:46.240
And you know, I'm
going to tell you.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.710
I've been making
and eating pho--

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:51.370
well, I've been eating
pho since I was 5 and 1/2.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:55.450
But I've been making pho
probably for about 12 years

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:59.930
since I started
writing my first book.

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:01.930
And I was like, you
know, if I'm going

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:04.690
to be a respectable
Vietnamese cook,

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.940
I need to learn how to make pho.

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:10.569
And then I realized
that it just took

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:14.533
practice and a lot of eating.

00:17:14.533 --> 00:17:19.630
And there's also travel too,
because everywhere I go,

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:24.280
I try to find a pho
shop to stop by.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:28.099
And there's a lot of stories
about pho that are really cool.

00:17:28.099 --> 00:17:31.030
So like I talked to
this guy who talked

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:33.430
about his scraping the bones.

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:36.010
And he was a man in Hanoi
who was like a former cop.

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:39.520
And he's like, I think I
want to open a pho shop.

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:43.000
And so he went and he
apprenticed for months

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.191
with this master pho vendor.

00:17:45.191 --> 00:17:46.690
And then at the end
of the line he's

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:48.830
like, it's really a lot of work.

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:50.500
I don't think I want to do this.

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:54.350
But he learned the thing about
the bone-scraping business.

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:54.850
Anyway.

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:59.020
So you get your
onion to this level.

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:04.330
And then what you want to
do is cut it into chunks.

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:07.480
And then you want to
just give it a smack.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:10.570
If you have a meat
mallet, otherwise

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:12.910
known as a meat tenderizer,
that thing that's

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:15.400
like a hammer for the kitchen?

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.610
Use that on this.

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:17.770
It's OK.

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:21.710
Because otherwise sometimes
when I use a knife,

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:23.020
it kind of goes flying.

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:31.080
And what I'm going to
do is-- like that--

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:38.766
is I'm going to pass this around
so that you guys can smell it.

00:18:38.766 --> 00:18:40.300
Here you go.

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:43.480
So there's a certain
sweetness, sweet spiciness.

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:48.200
And that's what
imparts flavor to pho.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.462
Now let's talk about the spices.

00:18:50.462 --> 00:18:52.420
And you would do the same
thing with the onion.

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:54.970
And if you're working
with shallot, then by all

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:57.460
means they're smaller.

00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:00.460
This is what I would
call a small shallot.

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:04.210
In Vietnam, the shallots
are about this small.

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:04.870
They're tiny.

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:08.440
And they look like
red boiling onions.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:12.060
In America where everything's
bigger, buy bigger shallots.

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:16.150
In fact, in the recipes, you'll
see me say, by huge ones.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:20.670
Because then it'll
take less time.

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:25.670
And it imparts a flavor that's
a little bit stronger than onion

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:26.170
is.

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:27.820
Onion's a little bit sweeter.

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:33.400
And so Vietnamese cooks like
my mother came to America

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:37.930
and found that their beloved
shallot now cost a lot more.

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:40.270
This is like the typical
onion in Vietnam.

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:43.160
Yellow onions are
very expensive.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.120
But over here in the States,
yellow onion is affordable.

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:47.460
And shallot is expensive.

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:50.020
So people did a switcheroo.

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:51.220
This is a little sweeter.

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:53.330
This is a little
bit more pungent.

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:57.310
So the flavors of American pho--
what we're all pretty much more

00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:58.330
used to--

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:03.320
is really based upon this
hyphenated experience.

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:10.010
And so the pho story is one
that we can plug into at many,

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:12.214
many different levels
is what I'm saying.

00:20:12.214 --> 00:20:13.630
And just because
you're Vietnamese

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:15.755
does not mean that you need
to know how to make pho

00:20:15.755 --> 00:20:17.920
or that you're going
to make it well.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.910
All it takes is
practice and a lot

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:27.010
of just figuring out like
teasing out what goes into pho.

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:28.630
So first we got the aromatics.

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:32.230
Then you've got your
beef bones there.

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:35.290
Or if you're making a vegetarian
one, you've got vegetables.

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:40.180
And in this beautiful bowl
are all of the vegetables

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:46.460
that we used for the vegan pho
broth that you'll be tasting.

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:50.320
There's also a beef pho
one that you'll be tasting.

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:55.540
But the only thing that may
actually be interesting to you

00:20:55.540 --> 00:21:00.010
is what the hell is an
apple doing in here?

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:02.470
The apple is in the broth.

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:05.110
And you'll see in the
recipes, because I needed

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:07.390
a little natural sweetness.

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:09.640
So Vietnamese food, like
a lot of Asian food,

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.460
is a balance of savory sweet.

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:16.190
So naturally, hey, I'm going
to use a little MSG, right?

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:17.690
Sort of like mother's
little helper.

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:21.920
But a lot of us don't
want to use MSG.

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:26.410
Or maybe it's not like a
regular American kitchen item.

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:28.090
But you need that
little sweetness.

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:31.120
And so traditionally
you would get that

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:36.790
from using this stuff, which
is Chinese yellow rock sugar.

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:42.080
And it's available
at Asian markets.

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:46.600
And they look like a gemstone
that you can maybe make

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.815
a ring out of for your partner.

00:21:49.815 --> 00:21:53.020
Or sometimes they're
like these big chunks.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.184
But this is the packaging
that it comes in.

00:21:55.184 --> 00:21:57.100
And get the yellow stuff,
not the white stuff.

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:58.640
Because the yellow stuff--

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.810
it has a little
better rounder flavor.

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:04.150
It's a semi-refined
sugar, if you're

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:07.420
interested in glycemic issues.

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:09.310
But do you need that?

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:10.630
Not necessarily.

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:15.280
If you use a Fuji
apple, then you

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:18.880
get that natural
sweetness built in.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:22.310
And you don't really need
to go and get that sugar.

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:23.890
The sugar is very
easy to use, just

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:26.970
like MSG is very easy to use
for that little bit of burst.

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:28.720
And they're different
levels of sweetness.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.320
But I found that when you're
not near an Asian market,

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.480
or you don't want to
go, the little apple

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:35.830
is quite, quite nice.

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:38.170
Make sure you peel
it before you use it,

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:41.330
because there are waxes
and stuff in there.

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:43.600
So you've got your main
featured ingredients.

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.370
Let's talk about the spices.

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:52.600
So typically people are like
oh, pho is all about star anise.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:53.170
No.

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:56.050
That is not the
only spice in pho.

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:56.840
It's a blend.

00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:00.220
It's a dance of spice notes.

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:03.630
And the spices should never
ever hit you on the head.

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:07.324
What happens is a
lot of pho cooks--

00:23:07.324 --> 00:23:08.740
professional and
home cooks-- they

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:11.965
will add the spices toward
the end of the brewing time.

00:23:11.965 --> 00:23:15.250
And sometimes they
kind of go overboard.

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:17.620
And it's like, boom!

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:18.700
Way too much spice.

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:20.245
And you're not
getting the subtleties

00:23:20.245 --> 00:23:23.830
of pho, which is the
beefiness, or the vegetables,

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:25.885
or the chicken, or
even sometimes seafood.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:32.860
So at home you can put those
spices right into your broth

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:33.970
as you're making it.

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:36.970
And they will then
kind of get subsumed

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:40.210
into the layers of flavors
that you're building.

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:41.680
And so what have we got?

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:45.260
Yes we've got our stick star
anise friends right here.

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:51.310
We've also got coriander seed.

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:55.840
In my chicken pho broth, when
I'm starting from raw chicken,

00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:00.880
I use coriander seed, a few
cloves, and also cilantro.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:06.700
Chicken, for obvious reasons, is
a different animal than a cow.

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:08.590
And the flesh is lighter.

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:13.090
So it really cannot
take star anise unless

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:15.820
the chicken's been-- like you'll
see in the rotisserie chicken

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:18.850
pho recipe I use star
anise and cinnamon,

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:21.370
because that's where you
can really like take it.

00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:22.900
Because a roast
chicken or a roast

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:26.080
turkey has a strong flavor.

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.690
Whereas when you're
using raw chicken,

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:29.920
it's much more delicate.

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.980
And you should treat your
proteins appropriately.

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:34.960
And that thing about
chicken not being a cow,

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.220
that came from my mother.

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:37.720
Because one day I was like, Mom.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.940
You know, like everybody's
making their chicken pho

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:41.342
with star anise and cinnamon.

00:24:41.342 --> 00:24:42.050
She looked at me.

00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:45.010
She goes, they're
different animals.

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:47.560
It is so true.

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.420
She's like in her eighties.

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.150
She gets to say what
she wants to say.

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:54.220
So we've got coriander
seed, star anise.

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:56.620
And when you use star
anise, everybody, make sure

00:24:56.620 --> 00:25:00.790
you count the number
of pods, like I say.

00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:03.840
Big whole nice lovely pods.

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.742
And if they're broken, it's OK.

00:25:05.742 --> 00:25:07.450
But if they've got
little ones, then that

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:09.640
doesn't really count as a pod.

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:12.580
So count them up,
cause you don't always

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:13.950
get whole star anise.

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:14.625
Whole cloves.

00:25:20.307 --> 00:25:22.390
In Vietnamese we call this,
[SPEAKING VIETNAMESE],

00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:25.810
which means "fragrant nail."

00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:26.830
It looks like a nail.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.470
It's very strong.

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:32.240
So I just add just
a few of them.

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.820
And use the whole ones.

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:36.790
Get nice plump ones.

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:40.780
These are all spices that you
can find at a regular market

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:45.220
in a bulk foods spice section,
for example at a health food

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:48.070
store, so that you don't
have to commit to buying

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:51.290
entire packages of them.

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:53.560
There's also cinnamon sticks.

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.110
So these are just
regular cinnamon sticks.

00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:57.760
And oftentimes, the
cinnamon that we're

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:01.540
buying in our
regular supermarkets

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:02.590
is coming from Vietnam.

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:03.530
Bonus!

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:06.230
Who would have known?

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:07.840
So pass those along.

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.970
And cinnamon comes
in different sizes.

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:11.350
Sometimes they're slender.

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:12.520
Sometimes they're medium.

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.560
Sometimes they're husky.

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.170
And the amount that
you use will vary

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:19.150
on how much pho you're making.

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:22.260
So you'll see that in the
recipe-- slender, medium,

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:24.610
or husky.

00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:28.300
And there's a weight amount in
the pho manual that you'll see.

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:29.440
Also fennel.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:32.380
Fennel is very
sweet and aromatic.

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:35.860
So that contributes
to pho sometimes too.

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:37.390
The last thing I
want to talk about

00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:41.770
is an unusual pho spice that
you don't see that often

00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:43.000
in the United States.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.670
And it's this stuff.

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:49.000
This is Chinese black cardamom.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.825
And it looks like a nutmeg,
for those of you who

00:26:52.825 --> 00:26:57.910
are familiar with whole spices.

00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:01.870
And you buy it whole
at Chinese markets.

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:06.790
Indian cooking also relies
upon Chinese black cardamom.

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:08.620
And theirs are smaller.

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:11.560
So if you're shopping
at an Indian market,

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:13.600
and you're buying
Indian cardamom,

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:20.800
use a weight amount for your
broth so that you're spot on.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:26.270
Because otherwise they are a
lot smaller than you think.

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:29.960
And of course, I got
it to work, Didi.

00:27:46.337 --> 00:27:47.920
So this, they come
in different sizes.

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:53.530
And you're gonna see there's
like small, medium, and large.

00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:55.120
So what does it
look like inside?

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:08.340
There are these little
pyramid-shaped pods.

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:15.380
It's very mentholly.

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:18.519
I've shown a lot of chefs and
even bartenders black cardamom.

00:28:18.519 --> 00:28:20.060
And some bartenders
are like, oh, I'm

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:24.470
going to shave it into my
cocktail, which then gave me

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:29.360
this other idea, which is
to make a pho spice blend.

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:33.590
So for you to get an association
of what all the spices are

00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:37.150
like together, so I've
brought a couple of samples.

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:40.540
And the smaller one is
made with star anise.

00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:44.150
And in the taller one
it says pho cardamom.

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:47.800
So this one has a little star
anise and some black cardamom.

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:48.960
And so they're different.

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.110
So in the book, I
use this in dishes

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:55.820
where I want to turn
something a little pho-ish.

00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:57.070
So fried rice.

00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:58.440
I want that hit.

00:28:58.440 --> 00:28:58.940
Boom!

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:03.530
Goes into the fried
rice as I'm cooking.

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:05.780
How do I make a pho dumpling?

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:09.830
Put a little pho spice in
there to give it that lift.

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:14.480
And I make a from-scratch
hoisin sauce.

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:18.110
So hoisin sauce typically
uses Chinese five spice.

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:23.570
And the hoisin sauce that is
served oftentimes at pho shops

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:26.594
is really sweet and kind
of yucky, in my opinion.

00:29:26.594 --> 00:29:27.260
I'm just saying.

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:28.160
You may love it.

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:33.410
But it can have a much more
sophisticated complexity

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:36.140
if you make it
yourself out of miso.

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:39.690
So I'm going to throw some
of pho spice in there.

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:41.660
I also use it in a cocktail--

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:43.970
a pho michelada beer cocktail.

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:47.470
I rim the glass
with kosher salt.

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:50.780
You're like, I want one now!

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:58.720
And so this is a great
thing to have around.

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:05.710
And you can keep it in
your cupboard for a while.

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:08.350
If you like it, you can
double it or triple it,

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:09.370
whatever you like.

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:12.417
And it's just a really
nice little thing

00:30:12.417 --> 00:30:13.250
to play around with.

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:15.541
You can mix it with kosher
salt and create your own rub

00:30:15.541 --> 00:30:16.720
for pork.

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:19.090
I also use it to make meatballs.

00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:21.040
You know those snappy
little meatballs.

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:24.190
You can make those meatballs
out of grocery store ingredients

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:26.440
and a food processor.

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.450
And it's no longer mystery meat.

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:30.370
It's really something
that you prepared.

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:34.210
And so there's a lot
going on with pho

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:35.350
that we don't know about.

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:37.990
So foundation stuff.

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:43.340
Let's talk about how to
put a bowl of pho together.

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:46.400
The other thing that I want
to discuss before that is-- so

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.010
your broth is done.

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:49.810
You want to strain it.

00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:56.920
So I am all into
straining through muslin.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:03.160
It is much more ecological
than using paper towel

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:07.060
or cheesecloth, which
oftentimes you cannot recycle.

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:12.070
This little guy, I
have used it for--

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:14.980
I don't know-- two
or three years.

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:17.090
I have different ones.

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:21.080
You buy the fabric
at a fabric store.

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.110
It's unbleached muslin.

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:29.710
And I go home and I tear it into
pieces around 18 by 18 square.

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:35.870
And I launder it in
the washing machine.

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:38.860
And the edges fray
really beautifully.

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:43.390
It traps all the impurities
and just enough fat

00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:45.345
so that you still have
some fat in the broth.

00:31:45.345 --> 00:31:46.120
Cause guess what?

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:47.020
Fat is flavor.

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:49.840
Oftentimes pho broth is
totally devoid of fat

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:51.280
and it's kind of thin.

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:55.030
But you need the
fat for roundness.

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:57.880
And so the muslin does that.

00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:01.060
Right afterwards you can launder
it with regular dish soap,

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:03.010
hang it out to dry or
throw it in the wash.

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:04.120
And you're good.

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:06.160
I use that to make soy milk.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:09.310
Cause I make my own soy milk
sometimes to make fresh tofu.

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:15.250
But I've got to ring out water
from tofu when I'm crushing it.

00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:16.450
Goes in there.

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:17.890
Vegetables.

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:20.110
Like sometimes if you're
pickling something

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:22.540
or you're making an Asian
salad with cucumber--

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:24.850
stuff that has a lot of water--

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:25.990
wring it out that way.

00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.980
Don't use your hands.

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:29.230
I mean, it's almost
kind of like,

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:32.790
just let the muslin
kind of do its thing.

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:33.910
And you can reuse it.

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:37.480
My problem with cheesecloth
is that it oftentimes bulks

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.220
and expands and rips.

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:41.680
And then you can't
re-use it so well.

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:44.890
So strain through muslin.

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:50.170
With ingredients like bones
and stuff, you can go ahead

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:55.570
and you can bulk up your bones
by saving bones from other food

00:32:55.570 --> 00:32:57.010
cooking projects.

00:32:57.010 --> 00:32:58.030
You know?

00:32:58.030 --> 00:33:05.200
And so you can amend
your collection.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:09.460
And one last thing
about the beef pho.

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:14.080
People often ask what is the
best cut for beef pho in terms

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:16.960
of the cooked beef?

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.910
Go brisket.

00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:21.980
And that's a beautiful
chunk right there.

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:26.620
And I'm going to ask you to do
a little extra heavy lifting

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:29.050
for me and hand me the brisket.

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:33.940
So this is what you would
see at a butcher shop.

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:41.500
And I like to get the brisket
from the fattier part,

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:44.450
because it's just going
to have more flavor.

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:46.960
So when you're shopping,
ask the butcher,

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:49.900
can I get the thicker chunk
with a little bit of fat on it?

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:52.030
Because that's
going to add flavor.

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:59.670
And there's very little going
on with pho in terms of--

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:00.546
it's a boiling thing.

00:34:00.546 --> 00:34:02.836
That's why in the book I'm
like, if you can boil water,

00:34:02.836 --> 00:34:03.550
you can make pho.

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:06.645
Because that's about as
technical as it gets.

00:34:06.645 --> 00:34:08.770
But there are certain things
about the ingredients,

00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:11.280
like, you want to choose
your ingredients wisely.

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:15.219
Buy the best bones and the
best brisket, meats and noodles

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:17.199
and stuff that you can afford.

00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:20.900
And then your pho will
taste even better.

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:24.340
And then so that's going on.

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:26.650
So your broth is taking care.

00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:28.150
It's strained.

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:30.280
And when you're
making your broth,

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:34.870
the only salty element
that you have going on

00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:43.389
is salt. You're going to season
the broth at the end with fish

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:49.179
sauce or soy sauce, or I
use Bragg liquid aminos,

00:34:49.179 --> 00:34:55.429
which is a really
umami-intense ingredient.

00:34:55.429 --> 00:35:00.110
And you do that at the end,
because you want that umami

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:02.060
burst to happen at the end.

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:07.490
That expression of I'm
savory to happen then.

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:09.470
I used to put it
in the broth when

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:11.300
I was simmering everything.

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:13.650
And I got some flack for it.

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:15.920
So I did that 10 years ago.

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:22.850
And then when I was researching
pho in Hanoi for a "Saveur"

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:28.040
magazine article
back in 2010, there

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:32.130
were these two chefs who
were in their sixties.

00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:34.040
And they said, sister.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.330
We have your cookbook.

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:36.590
And I was like, oh, great.

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:38.194
That's not a good
beginning, right?

00:35:38.194 --> 00:35:40.610
And they were talking about
"Into the Vietnamese Kitchen."

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:44.120
They said, you know that
pho recipe of yours?

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:47.840
Why do you put your fish
sauce at the beginning and not

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.176
the end?

00:35:49.176 --> 00:35:51.050
And I was like, because
that's how I like it.

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:52.670
And I like how it
flavors the meat.

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:54.170
So they go, no, no, no.

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:54.950
Put it at the end.

00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:58.850
You're going to get
the floral qualities

00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:00.900
of fish sauce that way.

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:01.610
So I went home.

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:02.919
And I was talking to my mom.

00:36:02.919 --> 00:36:03.710
She goes, oh, yeah.

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:05.626
I've been wondering for
years why you do that.

00:36:05.626 --> 00:36:07.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:08.280
So then I tried it out.

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:10.010
And you do.

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:13.460
You get that expression
of savoriness.

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:19.550
And you get the role of those
umami ingredients as a burst

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:20.832
rather than as a layer.

00:36:20.832 --> 00:36:22.790
Because pho otherwise
when you taste the broth,

00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:23.570
you're going, hm.

00:36:23.570 --> 00:36:25.340
It needs a little something.

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:26.870
But then once you
finish it-- it's

00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:29.150
like a finishing salt function.

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:29.780
OK?

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:32.620
So think of it that way.

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:36.200
And so you're going
to season your broth.

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:39.200
Always season your broth
a little bit saltier

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.480
than what you're
comfortable with,

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:45.260
because the rest of the
ingredients are not that salty.

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:48.920
We're talking about
noodles that have just

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:52.190
been-- these are fresh
noodles that Google uses.

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:56.090
When you're using dried noodles
like the ones in the box,

00:36:56.090 --> 00:36:58.250
or these up here--

00:36:58.250 --> 00:36:58.790
sorry.

00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:00.415
You didn't know
sitting there was going

00:37:00.415 --> 00:37:01.790
to be so problematic today.

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:05.000
But I do not have
Wilt Chamberlain arms.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.110
So he's a basketball player
from a very long time ago.

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:14.761
So noodles come in
different widths.

00:37:14.761 --> 00:37:15.260
OK.

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:17.440
So small, medium, large.

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:21.200
Like clothing sizes,
there is no standard.

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:22.290
So you just have to look.

00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:28.310
So think of it as
linguini is small.

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:32.990
Fettuccini is medium, or what
you would use for Pad Thai.

00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:35.950
Pappardelle is large.

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:38.720
For pho soup--
and you would want

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:41.510
to use like small or medium.

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:44.330
The medium width noodles
give you a little bit more

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:46.610
of a mouth feel to them.

00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:48.320
And some people
really like that.

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:52.220
In Vietnam, the difference
between northern and southern

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:54.302
pho is oftentimes the
width of the noodles,

00:37:54.302 --> 00:37:55.760
as well as the
flavor of the broth.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.620
So they're wider in the North.

00:37:57.620 --> 00:37:59.420
And the broth is salty, sweet.

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:01.790
In the South, the
noodles are narrower.

00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:04.970
And the flavor is sweet, salty.

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:09.030
That's part of the regional pho
fight that goes on in Vietnam.

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:11.960
So these are brands
that I really like.

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:13.620
And I picked these
up at Asian markets.

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:17.105
So we're talking about
Ranch 99, Lion, Marina.

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:22.680
If you're traveling to
other parts of the country,

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:29.570
you can also pick H Mart, which
is a really well-known chain.

00:38:29.570 --> 00:38:33.410
So any time that you have--

00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:35.990
sometimes there's a little
bit of scuzz left over

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:37.190
in your broth.

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:41.780
This little guy, which is an
Asian scum skimmer or soup

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:44.859
skimmer, is great for--
it's very, very silky.

00:38:44.859 --> 00:38:46.400
And before I get
this dirty, I'm just

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:50.330
going to pass it around so
that you get to feel it.

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:51.560
It is very smooth.

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:54.890
And it gets that scum right off.

00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:59.330
And it is just a
fabulous tool to get.

00:38:59.330 --> 00:39:00.680
You can order those online.

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:03.080
I believe those are
called soup scummers.

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:07.880
But like my friends and I were
like, get the scum skimmer!

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:11.900
And it's really a
wonderful, wonderful tool

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:18.080
for removing
impurities from broth.

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:20.700
So you've got your noodles.

00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:23.090
And if you're using dry
noodles, what you need to do

00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:24.470
is to soak them first.

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:26.990
You rehydrate them
in hot tap water.

00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:31.640
So let them sit in there
until they're opaque and soft.

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:33.800
And then the beauty
of doing that is

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:37.430
that once they're
rehydrated, and drained,

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:40.040
you can keep them in your
fridge for five days.

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:40.850
Hello!

00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:43.280
Pho any time.

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:43.940
Right?

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:49.790
Some people boil their
noodles before they plate them

00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:51.500
up and make their bowls.

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:54.490
The problem with that is that
you can't have leftovers,

00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:58.540
because cooked rice noodles,
they break under refrigeration.

00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:01.650
So if you soak them, then
you're good to go for five days

00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:03.120
whenever you want pho.

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:04.810
The other things that
you can perhaps--

00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:07.290
so you've got your
protein setup.

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:09.870
So you've got your meats ready.

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:13.350
You've got your-- thank you.

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:21.540
If you're a vegetarian,
then we have tofu.

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:27.630
And you can go ahead and
you can slice everything up.

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:31.150
You've got the onion.

00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:34.490
This is very, very
thinly sliced red onion.

00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:36.870
You can use yellow
onion, if you like.

00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:39.480
You've got cilantro.

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:42.030
And if you prep your
cilantro ahead of time,

00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:45.870
you can wash it, spin
it dry, chop it up.

00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:49.680
You can keep it in the
fridge for a day in advance.

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:50.430
Green onions.

00:40:53.350 --> 00:41:02.950
Use the green part with
the solid white part.

00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:05.260
Some people, traditionally
they would add this

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:10.700
to the simmering pho broth
for a little special treat.

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:12.440
It turns kind of leek-like.

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:14.770
So you could drop that
into your pho broth

00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:19.270
as you are getting things ready.

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:27.100
The reason why you don't
want to use that stuff raw--

00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:30.820
unless you've got these slender,
slender spring onions, like,

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:34.570
we're talking the size of
a wooden pencil slender--

00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:36.280
is that it's very harsh.

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.350
So not good for a date night.

00:41:38.350 --> 00:41:41.290
Date night pho, not good.

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:46.030
So you want to use
just the green part,

00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:47.620
and just very thinly slice it.

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:54.470
And you can do this
prep for the garnish.

00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:57.980
Like I said, a day or
so in advance, or just

00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:01.380
while you're
gathering everything.

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:03.860
Phos are great team projects.

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:05.570
You've got friends,
you have family over,

00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:07.550
set up a pho assembly line.

00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:10.010
Get them all to put
their own bowls together.

00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:13.277
And you just taste the
broth and ladle it over.

00:42:13.277 --> 00:42:14.735
And they can choose
their proteins.

00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:23.700
And then you've got your
tofu or chicken or--

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:26.610
the thing when you're working
with the toppings for pho

00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:29.580
for the protein
elements, they to be thin

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:35.910
enough so that they can be
warmed up by the hot broth

00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:37.170
very quickly.

00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:42.480
The other thing too is that you
need it to be chopstickable.

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:44.400
You can pick it up
with a chopstick.

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:50.190
So I would not say put a chunk
like this into my bowl of pho.

00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:50.730
No!

00:42:50.730 --> 00:42:52.230
Right?

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:54.180
Clearly for the
fact that how can I

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:56.130
eat this with my chopsticks?

00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:58.338
Well, you don't have to eat
pho with your chopsticks.

00:42:58.338 --> 00:43:00.309
You can use a fork if
you like with a spoon.

00:43:00.309 --> 00:43:02.100
But the thing is that
it's just unpleasant.

00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:05.250
And the hot broth is what's
going to warm things up.

00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:08.850
And it's not going to warm
up a block of tofu like this.

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:12.690
It will, however warm up pieces
of tofu that are thinly sliced.

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:22.570
If you have a piece of tofu
that's more like this size,

00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:27.880
or even like this, I'm going
to show you a little very

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:37.900
simple trick, which is if you're
slicing at an angle, like so,

00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:46.590
you're getting these beautiful
pieces that are thin.

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:48.340
It's almost like cutting
a piece of steak.

00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:52.000
But if you just angle it.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.760
Similarly, you can
cut anything this way.

00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:57.790
But it's beautiful for
tofu, because then you're

00:43:57.790 --> 00:44:06.790
going to expose more
surface area to the heat.

00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:08.830
I do this when I'm
making ban mi sandwiches.

00:44:08.830 --> 00:44:10.990
I would never put an
entire piece of tofu

00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:13.030
like this in a ban mi.

00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:17.680
For the same reason you slice up
your meat for a deli sandwich.

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:19.330
Slice it thinly.

00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:21.970
And it'll lay flat
on your bread,

00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:24.160
just like it will lay
flat on your noodles.

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:25.551
All right.

00:44:25.551 --> 00:44:26.050
So.

00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:30.460
You basically have
two pots going--

00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:33.430
one for water and one for broth.

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:37.270
And you bring them up to a boil.

00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:44.090
Meanwhile, with your noodles I
like to portion my noodles out

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:47.600
first into each bowls.

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:48.770
These are tasting bowls.

00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:53.010
So at home you can make
them as large as you want.

00:44:56.280 --> 00:45:02.450
And then I finish tasting
my broth one last time.

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:12.140
And be careful with
broth that's boiling.

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:20.400
You put salt in.

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:24.094
When a pot is boiling,
it will overflow.

00:45:24.094 --> 00:45:25.260
And you have to clean it up.

00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:28.205
I have cleaned that up many,
many times on my stove.

00:45:28.205 --> 00:45:29.830
If you've got an
induction, no problem.

00:45:29.830 --> 00:45:31.288
You're just wiping
the thing clean.

00:45:31.288 --> 00:45:34.220
But think about that.

00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:34.980
All right.

00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:38.760
So this is the other
kind of tool that I love.

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:41.290
This is a noodle dunker.

00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:44.740
Scum skimmer.

00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:45.670
Doodle dunker.

00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:50.140
Well, you'll see like
noodle soup strainer,

00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:51.940
or noodle strainer.

00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:54.865
And the thing with
this is that you can--

00:45:54.865 --> 00:45:57.862
I'll just show you.

00:45:57.862 --> 00:46:01.720
You dunk this in your noodles
in your pot like this.

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:07.600
You can use this
little guy for pastas,

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:09.640
to blanch vegetables,
whatever you want,

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:14.140
because it's never
going to touch.

00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:17.200
You can pull it out very, very
quickly into small portions.

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:20.230
And once that I dump
it into my bowl,

00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:24.029
I shake my bowl to
distribute the noodles.

00:46:24.029 --> 00:46:24.820
And you're dunking.

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:26.020
How long do you dunk for?

00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:27.490
It depends on your noodle.

00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:30.820
These fresh noodles take
very, very little time.

00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:33.910
With the drier ones, if I
were using the wider ones,

00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:36.490
I would dunk them a
little bit longer.

00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:37.370
And also it depends.

00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:38.995
Do you like your
noodle soft, or do you

00:46:38.995 --> 00:46:42.220
like them a little bit chewy?

00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:44.640
I beg your pardon?

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:47.210
Once that they are--

00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:47.710
here.

00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:49.170
I'm just going to
pass that along.

00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:54.580
Once that they have softened
like this in the strainer,

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:56.890
you can also use
some chopsticks.

00:46:56.890 --> 00:46:59.877
And you can just
poke at it and see.

00:46:59.877 --> 00:47:00.376
Yeah.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.860
And then you're going
to add your toppings.

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:14.120
So you arrange your
elements for your bowl

00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:15.890
flat like I'm doing like so.

00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:22.951
Then you've got your onion.

00:47:22.951 --> 00:47:24.200
Then you've got your cilantro.

00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:29.040
Your green onion.

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:30.640
So you've got this going.

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:32.920
If you like black
pepper, this is the time

00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:35.600
to throw some on there.

00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:38.210
Meanwhile, while all
this is happening,

00:47:38.210 --> 00:47:42.800
you've got your
garnish plate going.

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:48.820
And so we've got
various different herbs.

00:47:51.400 --> 00:48:00.980
And Thai basil is not the
only Vietnamese herb for pho.

00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:06.800
In fact, purists will say that
this is a foreign vegetable,

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:09.790
because they're like,
that's like for Thai food.

00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:11.450
Just like sriracha
is for Thai food.

00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:13.820
What's it doing in my pho?

00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:15.110
Those are pho diehards.

00:48:15.110 --> 00:48:18.660
This adds a wonderful,
wonderful fragrance to pho.

00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:23.249
However, you will go very,
very far with regular mint.

00:48:23.249 --> 00:48:23.915
It's refreshing.

00:48:23.915 --> 00:48:26.810
It grows like a
weed, my friends.

00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:28.640
And you can grow it
in a pot very easily.

00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:30.860
And it grows year round
in many, many places.

00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:32.570
You keep it indoors.

00:48:32.570 --> 00:48:35.010
So mint adds a wonderful,
refreshing quality.

00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:39.740
So when you're considering
that garnish plate,

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:44.750
Thai basil, mint, chiles,
lime, sriracha, hoisin sauce,

00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:45.740
whatever you want.

00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:50.990
In terms of the chiles, Fresnos
are wonderful, as well as

00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:52.190
serranos.

00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:55.550
Sometimes jalapenos
taste like bell peppers.

00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:57.180
I know one little
Vietnamese lady,

00:48:57.180 --> 00:49:00.800
she brings her own chilies with
her to Vietnamese restaurant

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:02.762
because she just doesn't
like the jalapeno.

00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:08.510
So Fresnos are just wonderful.

00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:10.240
Got a moderate heat.

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:11.120
Thai chiles.

00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:17.270
If you've got a really
tiny Thai chile like this,

00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:20.050
cut it on the bias.

00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:21.890
Bias just means diagonal.

00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:26.990
Or you can also cut if you
want to in halfsied like this.

00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:29.120
The reason why you don't
want to cut really, really

00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:33.440
tiny, tiny pieces is that once
you put this into your bowl,

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:36.290
it is very, very
difficult to retrieve.

00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:37.620
You will lose it.

00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:40.120
And you may be sorry.

00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:43.280
So have all these
things on a plate.

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:45.590
If you're into beansprout,
have those two.

00:49:45.590 --> 00:49:47.090
You can blanch your
beansprout ahead

00:49:47.090 --> 00:49:51.380
of time using this tool
in your pot of water

00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:54.200
before you do your noodles,
because your noodles

00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:55.550
will cloud up the broth.

00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:57.250
And you don't want
your beansprouts

00:49:57.250 --> 00:50:00.420
to get a noodle starch bath.

00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:03.497
So take all of that
into consideration.

00:50:03.497 --> 00:50:06.080
So the last thing you would do--
and you've got your garnishes

00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:12.694
sitting out there-- your herbs,
your chili sauces and stuff--

00:50:12.694 --> 00:50:14.360
you don't have to
have all these things.

00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:18.530
There is no right or wrong
reason or wrong way to eat pho.

00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:19.280
OK?

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:20.720
And in fact, when
I grew up, there

00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:25.790
was no hoisin sauce or
sriracha, because my parents--

00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:28.400
they're hard core.

00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:31.130
And so all I got was mint
picked from the yard.

00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:36.140
And so there are
many different ways.

00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:39.830
And there's actually
a recipe in the book

00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:43.130
and on the recipe
cards around that

00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:50.030
is for a chili sauce that's
modeled on something sold only

00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:53.110
in Vietnam these days.

00:50:53.110 --> 00:50:56.540
And it's a really great
fun little sauce to make.

00:50:56.540 --> 00:51:01.190
So the last thing you want to do
when the bowl's being assembled

00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:05.750
is step up to your
boiling pot of broth,

00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:06.770
and then ladle it over.

00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:09.860
And when you ladle,
ladle in a circular path.

00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:15.110
Why circular?

00:51:15.110 --> 00:51:18.140
Because then it will
warm everything up.

00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:21.260
All the toppings will
then be warmed if you're

00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:22.610
doing a circular motion.

00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:29.240
And use a ladle that is
appropriate for the size

00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:30.980
of your bowls and stuff.

00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:33.140
And then you're through.

00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:35.260
And you run to
the table and eat.

00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:41.390
And when you're eating pho, I
like to wiggle my noodles up,

00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:44.220
because they get really
compacted at the bottom.

00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:47.990
So that's what we're going
to do today for you here

00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:51.280
at the Google kitchen.

00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:52.150
SPEAKER: Excellent.

00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:53.620
Thank you so much.

00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:55.680
While we're waiting
for tasty treats,

00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:57.100
does anybody have questions?

00:51:57.100 --> 00:52:00.409
Do you toast your
spices, was the question.

00:52:00.409 --> 00:52:01.450
ANDREA NGUYEN: I used to.

00:52:01.450 --> 00:52:04.060
I used to be a spice toaster.

00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:06.040
And so the idea
there is that you're

00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:11.410
helping the oils, the aromatics,
to release their potency.

00:52:11.410 --> 00:52:13.630
Well, if you're
going to be simmering

00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:15.520
that broth for
four to five hours

00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:17.271
or using a pressure cooker--

00:52:17.271 --> 00:52:17.770
no.

00:52:17.770 --> 00:52:19.686
If you're simmering it
for four to five hours,

00:52:19.686 --> 00:52:21.190
I do not toast them,
because they're

00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:25.990
going to be-- it's like a
long steep in that hot water.

00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:29.890
In the pressure cooker, or
when I make a quick broth using

00:52:29.890 --> 00:52:33.610
canned stock, I
do toast it, just

00:52:33.610 --> 00:52:35.350
because I'm working faster.

00:52:35.350 --> 00:52:38.020
So I want to really
bring up those flavors.

00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:42.820
And so I'm going to give
it that little bit of heat.

00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:44.969
SPEAKER: Is it OK to
boil your finished broth?

00:52:44.969 --> 00:52:45.760
ANDREA NGUYEN: Yes.

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:50.170
It is not OK to boil
your simmering broth.

00:52:50.170 --> 00:52:57.580
Reason being is that
if you're boiling--

00:52:57.580 --> 00:53:02.080
let's say I've got my
beef bones and my chicken

00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:03.700
bones in the pot.

00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:06.340
And it's going
really, really harsh,

00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:08.140
what happens is
you're going to be

00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:11.200
blending all of those
impurities in with the broth.

00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:13.810
And that's where you
get the cloudiness.

00:53:13.810 --> 00:53:15.700
You're getting rid of
a lot of the cloudiness

00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:17.740
through that parboiling
business that I

00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:20.590
discussed at the front end,
and also with straining

00:53:20.590 --> 00:53:22.310
through the fabric.

00:53:22.310 --> 00:53:25.480
And that will get you super,
super crystal clear broth,

00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:26.200
I guarantee you.

00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:32.417
But that boiling will
suspend stuff in there

00:53:32.417 --> 00:53:33.250
if you're not clear.

00:53:33.250 --> 00:53:34.819
SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:34.819 --> 00:53:36.610
ANDREA NGUYEN: You
could totally boil that,

00:53:36.610 --> 00:53:37.540
because you've strained it.

00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:38.770
All the impurities are gone.

00:53:38.770 --> 00:53:40.101
It's OK.

00:53:40.101 --> 00:53:40.600
I know.

00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:42.520
It's confusing.

00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:43.510
Yes.

00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:45.970
SPEAKER: Is there any way
to decloud cloudy broth?

00:53:45.970 --> 00:53:47.230
AUDIENCE: Milk.

00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:49.240
ANDREA NGUYEN: Really?

00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:51.030
SPEAKER: Olivia says milk.

00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:53.460
The milk will bond with the
cloudiness and make it float.

00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:55.100
And then what you strain--

00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:55.600
oh!

00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:56.250
Food lab.

00:53:56.250 --> 00:53:56.800
Sure.

00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:57.160
Kenji.

00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:57.740
He would know.

00:53:57.740 --> 00:53:59.239
ANDREA NGUYEN:
Sometimes that works.

00:53:59.239 --> 00:54:00.748
Sometimes it doesn't.

00:54:00.748 --> 00:54:02.080
SPEAKER: Noted.

00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:05.235
ANDREA NGUYEN: And for
example, we actually today--

00:54:09.730 --> 00:54:12.790
you can try straining it
again through a coffee filter.

00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:14.830
You can try egg
whites, which will--

00:54:14.830 --> 00:54:16.930
but you know what?

00:54:16.930 --> 00:54:18.190
It's not going to--

00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:20.260
it's a look thing
more than anything.

00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:22.094
SPEAKER: You should
just eat it, ultimately.

00:54:22.094 --> 00:54:23.301
ANDREA NGUYEN: You know what?

00:54:23.301 --> 00:54:24.470
If it's like dishwater--

00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:25.886
sometimes I'm gonna
tell you this.

00:54:25.886 --> 00:54:26.740
I'll tell you this.

00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:28.810
I go to some of
these pho shops--

00:54:28.810 --> 00:54:30.070
even my favorite pho shops.

00:54:30.070 --> 00:54:32.380
And sometimes at
the end of service

00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:35.440
when they're maybe at
the bottom of the pot,

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:38.470
the broth is cloudy.

00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:43.030
And sometimes too when
you stir up your noodles,

00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:47.510
the starches in the noodles will
make the broth a little cloudy.

00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:52.360
So that cloudiness is not
necessarily a bad thing.

00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:55.137
But sometimes when your
finished broth, if it's cloudy,

00:54:55.137 --> 00:54:55.720
you know what?

00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:59.320
You just move on and
you make another pot.

00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:01.230
I mean, it's just from--

00:55:01.230 --> 00:55:02.950
SPEAKER: That's a
great philosophy.

00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:04.910
We don't take ourselves
too seriously here.

00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:06.160
ANDREA NGUYEN: I don't either.

00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:07.060
Yes.

00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:09.610
SPEAKER: What's your favorite
pho spot in the Bay Area?

00:55:09.610 --> 00:55:12.590
ANDREA NGUYEN: I like this
place down in South San Jose.

00:55:12.590 --> 00:55:14.050
So sort of in the hood.

00:55:14.050 --> 00:55:18.910
And it's called Pho Y.
Just like the letter y.

00:55:18.910 --> 00:55:20.381
Number 1.

00:55:20.381 --> 00:55:22.880
SPEAKER: That's how you know
it's going to be a legit place.

00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:24.320
There's a number in the name.

00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:26.650
ANDREA NGUYEN: All
they serve is pho.

00:55:26.650 --> 00:55:29.260
No rice paper rolls.

00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:31.000
No rice plates.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.270
You just get chicken or beef.

00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:34.870
And the beef is
much, much better.

00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:43.030
It's on East Capital Expressway,
close to the first intersection

00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:46.120
as you're going
towards the mountains.

00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:48.940
And it's like a
moderate sized bowl.

00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:54.490
And you go there on the
weekends around 11:30.

00:55:54.490 --> 00:55:56.470
And everybody is there.

00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:58.510
And it's multicultural.

00:55:58.510 --> 00:55:59.980
It's families.

00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:01.840
They're kind of rude.

00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:03.160
SPEAKER: Again, so legit.

00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:08.500
ANDREA NGUYEN: It's so genuine
and honest in the experience.

00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:10.990
SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:56:10.990 --> 00:56:12.910
ANDREA NGUYEN: As
everybody's getting pho,

00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:17.075
I want to give a big thanks to
our staff here at Kitchen Sync.

00:56:20.050 --> 00:56:23.320
They take such good care of us.

00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:24.520
Any last questions?

00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:27.800
There'll be book signing
after we get a chance to eat.

00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:28.424
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:56:28.424 --> 00:56:30.760
How did you prepare the tofu?

00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:33.040
SPEAKER: How did you
prepare that tofu?

00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:35.980
ANDREA NGUYEN: Well, the way
that I prepare tofu in the book

00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:37.030
is very simple.

00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:43.180
So I get a block
of extra-firm tofu.

00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:48.790
So that's the tofu that is
sold in a tub with water--

00:56:48.790 --> 00:56:51.650
with a moat of water around it.

00:56:51.650 --> 00:56:56.280
And so I'll slice the tofu.

00:56:56.280 --> 00:57:00.970
The tofu that Google
gets is restaurant size.

00:57:00.970 --> 00:57:04.150
So it's a little bit
different than what we see.

00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:05.650
But I get the tofu.

00:57:05.650 --> 00:57:08.680
And I'll cut it into
pieces about this size.

00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:11.440
And then I put it into
a nonstick skillet

00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:14.640
with a little bit of soy sauce.

00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:16.810
In the book, the recipe
is called pan-seared tofu.

00:57:16.810 --> 00:57:20.295
And it's one of my favorite ways
of making a grab and go tofu.

00:57:20.295 --> 00:57:22.240
So you put your tofu in there.

00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:25.360
No need to do that draining
business, all righty?

00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:29.500
Because in the skillet it
will release its liquid.

00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:32.740
Add soy sauce, turn
the tofu a few times.

00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:37.330
And then you turn on your
heat to around medium or so.

00:57:37.330 --> 00:57:41.399
The tofu then will release
its natural liquid.

00:57:41.399 --> 00:57:42.940
So it's draining
right there for you.

00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:45.490
It's then going to
get coated and pick up

00:57:45.490 --> 00:57:50.270
some flavor from the soy sauce.

00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:53.800
And then once that the
tofu looks kind of dryish,

00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:55.990
add a little bit of oil.

00:57:55.990 --> 00:57:59.230
And then you're going to
let that outer coating kind

00:57:59.230 --> 00:58:01.300
of sear and fry a little bit.

00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:03.170
And then once that's done--

00:58:03.170 --> 00:58:06.100
and total cooking time is like
10 minutes-- you are home.

00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:08.290
And then you just cool it.

00:58:08.290 --> 00:58:09.940
And I keep that in the fridge.

00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:12.400
And it lasts for days.

00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:14.140
And I use it for pho.

00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:16.090
I use it for fried rice.

00:58:16.090 --> 00:58:17.350
I'll put it in sandwiches.

00:58:17.350 --> 00:58:21.550
I sometimes just eat it
when I'm feeling hangry.

00:58:21.550 --> 00:58:25.565
So it's like one of my favorite
tofu convenience foods.

00:58:25.565 --> 00:58:27.440
SPEAKER: Thank you so
much for being with us.

00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:28.481
ANDREA NGUYEN: Thank you.

00:58:28.481 --> 00:58:32.290
