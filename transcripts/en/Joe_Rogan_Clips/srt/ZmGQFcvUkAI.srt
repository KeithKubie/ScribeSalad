1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,680
You know, I, I, I agree
with you that I don't,

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:08,430
I don't necessarily think we're getting
stupider or dumber in this country or in

3
00:00:08,431 --> 00:00:09,810
the world in general
because of the Internet,

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,320
but we're definitely getting weirder in
our perceptions of actual world events.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:20,460
And I think, um, every time something
like mass shootings for instance,

6
00:00:20,461 --> 00:00:24,510
like New Zealand, every time one of
these horrific tragedies takes place,

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,280
you see more and more division as I
watch people fight over it on Twitter,

8
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:34,050
people blaming leftwing people,
people blaming right wing people,

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,930
people trying to find some reason.

10
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:42,230
And this one is particularly disturbing
because it appears that at least one of

11
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:47,910
the guys, I don't know their names,
I don't know if they even released,

12
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,720
they withheld the names of
these guys who've done this.
I haven't seen the names.

13
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:56,040
I fought in it. One of them seems
like he's trolling. Like he,

14
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:58,350
he thanked Pewdie Pie and,

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,920
and said that Candace Owens was as big
as inspiration and he's doing that. Well,

16
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,840
I guess we could agree.
Some people are saying that that okay,

17
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:08,070
sign is a white power sign.

18
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:10,860
I know we had this dispute with
Tim Pool where he was saying,

19
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,550
I guess it is a game that some people
do play. What is it called, the game?

20
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,070
The look,
I don't know if there's an official name.

21
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,950
There's some game where if you look under
the table, you see someone doing that.

22
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:22,230
There are a lot of punch you or something.
Something stupid like that.

23
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,830
I saw the Steven Miller photo where
he's doing up his blazer and supposedly

24
00:01:25,831 --> 00:01:29,400
doing the why, but that of that,
is that the evidence enough? No,

25
00:01:29,401 --> 00:01:32,940
and there was a woman in court too that
was doing that where she had her hand

26
00:01:32,941 --> 00:01:34,440
like this and people were saying that.

27
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,220
But that's what people are talking about
rather than, right. Which is ridiculous.

28
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:40,170
Like Ah, evidence, evidence.

29
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,450
But this guy in custody is clearly
making that symbol clearly.

30
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,310
So like, what is he, you know,
he's like some troll murderer,

31
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:53,340
some troll mass murderer,
and he's both,

32
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,470
he's both fucking with everybody.

33
00:01:55,471 --> 00:01:59,520
And a cold blooded ruthless killer of
people that were praying. Yeah. I mean,

34
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:00,840
I think let's not lose sight of that.

35
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:04,430
You have to have some serious hatred to
walk into a mosque and gun down. Yeah.

36
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,290
He's a TTA people in seven people in
the other one. You know that's, yeah,

37
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,250
it's horrific across the board,
top to bottom. It's, it's horrific,

38
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:16,350
but it's also one of those things where
like we see so many of these now that

39
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:21,030
we're, we're starting to get numb.
Whether it's a a Jewish synagogue,

40
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,850
whether it's a, you know, a Muslim temple,

41
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:27,540
whether it's a gay club
where whether whatever it is,

42
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:32,070
it's like you see so many of these mass
murders now that it's just whether it's

43
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:35,610
a school or a movie
theater. I'd like, fuck man.

44
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,280
It's just it all,

45
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:43,281
like you were talking about when you
were filming the news and you're,

46
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:46,410
you're there,
you're watching the bullets fly by.

47
00:02:46,411 --> 00:02:50,910
You hear them fly by your head and you
are just watching it through the Lens.

48
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,190
We are many, many, many,

49
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:57,570
many levels removed from that and we're
sitting here trying to figure out what

50
00:02:57,571 --> 00:02:59,500
to do and we're there.

51
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:02,260
We're not where the bullets and the people
that are there where the bullets take

52
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:02,920
place.

53
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,920
They try to give you a description of
it and even they barely can comprehend

54
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:09,250
what happened.

55
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,960
But,
but also as you said,

56
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,130
we're going straight to the
argument about who to blame.

57
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,940
When did he follow and you
know, rather than, yes.

58
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:19,690
I mean if people spent as much time as
they spend arguing on Twitter at reading

59
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:22,540
[inaudible] I know people say fake news,

60
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:26,230
you know that there are people who you
can trust if they write a 10,000 word

61
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:30,150
piece on Syria for the New Yorker for
example, like you know that they're,

62
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,760
they're being fact check
and maybe it would be

63
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:37,790
better if there was a website where we
curated all of like the bulletproof,

64
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,060
that's terrible way to describe it,
but you know,

65
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,120
Lock Sa Rock solid
investigative journalism's
that are 100% ethical that you

66
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:51,780
could completely rely on for an
accurate assessment of what's happening.

67
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,760
Because it is difficult for
people and when people, they,

68
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,820
they rely on biased websites,
which many of them do,

69
00:03:59,821 --> 00:04:02,940
whether it's biased to the left or bias
to the right, things get even more money.

70
00:04:02,941 --> 00:04:05,430
And there's so many of them.
It's so easy to get,

71
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:10,200
so easy to reinforce your confirmation
bias, Wa whatever, you know,

72
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:14,460
whether it's left brain or right wing,
just find that website, read the comments.

73
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,650
These are my people.
They think like me.

74
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:16,941
And,

75
00:04:16,941 --> 00:04:19,560
and especially now mean it used to be if
you were conservatively and then you'd

76
00:04:19,561 --> 00:04:22,470
read the Wall Street Journal or
Liberal leading New York Times now,

77
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,600
no matter how far off the scale you are,

78
00:04:24,601 --> 00:04:27,200
you can find a pretty professional
looking website. Yeah.

79
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:31,050
That we'll write a story backing up your
prejudice and people aren't looking at

80
00:04:31,051 --> 00:04:33,540
the story thinking, okay, I'm gonna
find out what happened here. Yeah.

81
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:37,520
They're thinking, I know what my gut
feeling tells me I need to find a hit.

82
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,770
Not even a story. A headline. Yeah. That
justifies my gut feeling about this.

83
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,020
And that's as far as it seems to go.

84
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,110
Now,
you as a journalist,

85
00:04:45,111 --> 00:04:49,460
as a person who risked their life
to bring this information to people,

86
00:04:49,461 --> 00:04:51,470
how does this make you feel?
I mean,

87
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,620
is this part of the reason why you
needed to do that? MDME therapy,

88
00:04:54,621 --> 00:04:57,520
not just the fact that you
were, you know, you're,

89
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,190
you really are without better useful,

90
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,130
without a better term shell
shocked. Right? I mean,
you're, you're that, that Dah,

91
00:05:05,131 --> 00:05:06,490
Dah, Dah, Dah. You're there.

92
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,950
There's something that comes out
of that that's gotta be very,

93
00:05:09,951 --> 00:05:13,220
very difficult to recover
from and overcome. Yeah.

94
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,950
But there's also the fact that you're
going over there and bringing this shit

95
00:05:15,951 --> 00:05:17,890
back and it doesn't seem to,
people don't see to

96
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,470
you give a fuck. And that used to be what
kept you going is, is you thought like,

97
00:05:21,471 --> 00:05:23,780
some of my work is going to
make some kind of difference.

98
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:26,810
And when that starts to fade and you
start to think that's not going to happen.

99
00:05:26,811 --> 00:05:27,510
That's,

100
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:31,530
I'm sure your work makes
a lot of difference to the
people that pay attention to

101
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:36,360
it. That I think we're, we're
overwhelmed by bullshit.

102
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:40,620
I think it's everywhere. There's what
I mean bullshit. I mean like nonsense.

103
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,910
You know,

104
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:45,840
Kim Kardashians psoriasis is in the
front page of CNN or something like that.

105
00:05:45,841 --> 00:05:48,240
You know what I mean? It's not nonsense
to her, but you know what I mean?

106
00:05:48,241 --> 00:05:50,490
Like there's, there's stuff that
people are concentrating on.

107
00:05:50,491 --> 00:05:51,750
It's like Jesus Christ,

108
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,050
I mean, yeah, one of our, one of our
docs, Hbo, um, if it got 4 million views,

109
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:05,030
I think that would be considered very
good viewing figures in the country of 360

110
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,940
million people. Yeah. Well
it's very difficult to do

111
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:11,440
get people to watch documentaries
on real world events.

112
00:06:11,441 --> 00:06:14,860
You get them to watch documentaries on
like a sex call from Oregon or something

113
00:06:14,861 --> 00:06:18,200
like that. Like wow. While country
that probably got 10 million. Yeah.

114
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:22,900
It's this, I don't know man. You know,

115
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,380
this New Zealand thing
really had me rattled. I,

116
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:31,840
and you know what is also strange,
people like seem to demand a response.

117
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,490
They demand,
um,

118
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:37,210
people in the public eye to
talk about it and you know,

119
00:06:37,211 --> 00:06:39,310
say thoughts and prayers
or something like that.

120
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,930
But as soon as you say thoughts
and prayers, they'll say
they'll, it's impressive.

121
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,750
We've had that for years and
nothing's actually happened.
It's, yeah. Yeah. It's um,

122
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:51,580
it's very strict, but like
the, I don't know if they,

123
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,370
they're concerned that you're
not horrified. They want
to make sure you are like,

124
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,780
who the fuck isn't, like,
how could you not be,

125
00:06:58,781 --> 00:07:03,010
I don't understand this or is
it just they're just frustrated,

126
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,910
confused themselves.

127
00:07:03,911 --> 00:07:07,930
So just lashing out at any target
they can find or anyone they can find.

128
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,260
And also, you know, I mean, I know the
footage is available of, of, you know,

129
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:15,100
this guy's head cam as he,
as he shot everybody, but,

130
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:19,060
but footage like that has been widely
available for a long time now. Um,

131
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:22,030
and I think that's, that's had a massive,
nothing effect. I mean, you know, the,

132
00:07:22,031 --> 00:07:25,820
the picture of the Syrian refugee
washing up on the beach, you know,

133
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:28,040
it felt like that was
going to have an effect.

134
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:32,150
It felt like that was the picture that
was really gonna gonna change things. No,

135
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:36,170
I'm not sure it then it might have for
a couple days. Yeah. And then more news,

136
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,870
you know, I mean, not, you know,

137
00:07:38,871 --> 00:07:43,700
just to be not completely pessimistic
that when you're doing stuff for vice and

138
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:47,900
Hbo, you do get young people reaching
out to you and saying, oh, I had no idea.

139
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:52,040
I want to be a photographer or a doctor
or maybe that's an effect that's going

140
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,920
to be felt down the room. I don't
know. It feels like there are,

141
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,560
there is a generation of
people growing up thinking,

142
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,890
I'm not going to play by the normal set
of rules like I am going to actually try

143
00:08:00,891 --> 00:08:01,820
and do something about this.

144
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,160
I think I really do believe
you do have an effect.

145
00:08:04,161 --> 00:08:07,130
I think vice certainly has an effect.
I think a lot of this has an effect.

146
00:08:07,131 --> 00:08:11,540
I think it's very difficult to feel that
effect if you're not experiencing it

147
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:15,050
personally. I mean to, to just look
out onto the landscape and say,

148
00:08:15,051 --> 00:08:17,510
how much of an effect is this
having on people? It's hard.

149
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,090
Like where are you getting the
feedback from? How are you,

150
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:23,240
how are you gauging whether or not
this is changing people's perceptions?

151
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,100
Well, sometimes the feedback you
do get is is on Twitter we'll get,

152
00:08:29,101 --> 00:08:33,180
a few lunatics will say, Oh, you
failed to do so. Then you think, wow,

153
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,230
we're really having no impact,

154
00:08:34,231 --> 00:08:36,780
but I think that's an argument
for just not reading the comments.

155
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,990
There's a little bit of
that. And then, you know,

156
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:43,991
I had Renee to rest on recently and she's
done a lot of work covering all these

157
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:48,800
various, uh, Russian troll
farms and how they, uh,

158
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,920
so how they essentially
organize conflict online and,

159
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:56,211
you know,
the,

160
00:08:56,211 --> 00:09:00,570
they set up these things where you have
like a pro Texas movement and they set

161
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:04,440
them up across the street from a pro
Muslim movement and they do it on purpose.

162
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:09,710
And then they have these pro
LGBT movement things online.

163
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:14,220
They organize to attack certain
people in certain groups,

164
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:19,170
diminish certain aspects and defied parts
of the Democratic Party. It's crazy.

165
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,460
Yeah. When you hear about shit like that
on top of all this, you're like, well,

166
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:26,220
okay, uh, just the, the actual news
itself is so difficult to disseminate.

167
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,280
It's so difficult to figure out what
should I pay attention to? What's real?

168
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,030
And then you have this kind
of shit happening on top
of that. You're like, Whoa,

169
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,890
whoa, Whoa, fuck. You know.
