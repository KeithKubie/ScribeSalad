00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.700
What I want to do is think about
whether this expression right

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.520
over here would evaluate
the same way whether or not

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.240
we had parentheses.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.770
So to think about
that, let's first

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.290
think about how
it would evaluate

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.119
if we add the parentheses.

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:14.660
So if we add the
parentheses, we want

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.460
to do what's ever in
the parentheses first.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.140
And so here we have 8 minus
3, which is equal to 5.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:28.360
So this simplifies to 5
times 5 times 8 minus 3.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.140
And now we want to
do the multiplication

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.270
before we do subtraction.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.900
This goes back to
order of operations.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.140
You do your multiplication
and division first.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.160
Well, you do your
parentheses first.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.760
Then if you have multiplication,
division, addition,

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.730
and subtraction
all in a row, you

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.390
want to do your multiplication
and your division first.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.520
So here we're going to
multiply 5 times 8 to get 40,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.920
and then we're going to
subtract 3 to get 37.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.430
Now, let's think about
what this would evaluate

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.350
to if we did not
have the parentheses.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.330
So it would be 8 minus
3 times 8 minus 3.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.260
So we just have to
remind ourselves

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.770
about the order of operations.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.350
The convention is to do
your multiplication first.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.050
So you're actually going to
multiply the 3 times the 8

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.780
before you subtract
it from this 8

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.490
and then before you
subtract this 3.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.260
So we took away the parentheses,
but the order of operations

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.900
say, hey, do this
multiplication first.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.760
We could even put a parentheses
here to emphasize that.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:36.279
So this will become
8 minus 8 minus 24.

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:37.320
Let me write it this way.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.920
8 minus 24 minus 3.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.720
8 minus 24 minus 3.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.520
Now, 8 minus 24 is negative 16.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.010
You subtract another 3, you're
going to get to negative 19.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.380
So clearly, you get very,
very different values

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.142
depending on whether or
not you have parentheses.
