00:00:08.121 --> 00:00:11.452
Chat with a friend about
an established scientific theory

00:00:11.452 --> 00:00:15.690
and she might reply,
"Well, that's just a theory."

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.997
But a conversation about
an established scientific law

00:00:18.997 --> 00:00:22.994
rarely ends with,
"Well, that's just a law."

00:00:22.994 --> 00:00:24.346
Why is that?

00:00:24.346 --> 00:00:27.499
What is the difference 
between a theory and a law,

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:29.721
and is one better?

00:00:29.721 --> 00:00:32.919
Scientific laws and theories
have different jobs to do.

00:00:32.919 --> 00:00:37.191
A scientific law predicts
the results of certain initial conditions.

00:00:37.191 --> 00:00:40.917
It might predict your unborn 
child's possible hair colors,

00:00:40.917 --> 00:00:45.888
or how far a baseball travels
when launched at a certain angle.

00:00:45.888 --> 00:00:50.421
In contrast, a theory tries to provide
the most logical explanation

00:00:50.421 --> 00:00:53.695
about why things happen as they do.

00:00:53.695 --> 00:00:56.746
A theory might invoke
dominant and recessive genes

00:00:56.746 --> 00:01:01.722
to explain how brown-haired parents
ended up with a red-headed child,

00:01:01.722 --> 00:01:07.075
or use gravity to shed light 
on the parabolic trajectory of a baseball.

00:01:07.075 --> 00:01:08.273
In simplest terms,

00:01:08.273 --> 00:01:13.378
a law predicts what happens
while a theory proposes why.

00:01:13.378 --> 00:01:16.328
A theory will never grow up into a law,

00:01:16.328 --> 00:01:20.413
though the development of one
often triggers progress on the other.

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:25.736
In the 17th century, Johannes Kepler
theorized cosmic musical harmonies

00:01:25.736 --> 00:01:29.459
to explain the nature of planetary orbits.

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:33.183
He developed three brilliant laws
of planetary motion

00:01:33.183 --> 00:01:36.874
while he was studying decades 
of precise astronomical data

00:01:36.874 --> 00:01:40.756
in an effort to find support 
for his theory.

00:01:40.756 --> 00:01:43.488
While his three laws 
are still in use today,

00:01:43.488 --> 00:01:48.915
gravity replaced his theory of harmonics
to explain the planets' motions.

00:01:48.915 --> 00:01:51.167
How did Kepler get part of it wrong?

00:01:51.167 --> 00:01:54.569
Well, we weren't handed 
a universal instruction manual.

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:59.623
Instead, we continually propose,
challenge, revise, or even replace

00:01:59.623 --> 00:02:03.563
our scientific ideas 
as a work in progress.

00:02:03.563 --> 00:02:05.493
Laws usually resist change

00:02:05.493 --> 00:02:09.152
since they wouldn't have been adopted
if they didn't fit the data,

00:02:09.152 --> 00:02:14.767
though we occasionally revise laws 
in the face of new unexpected information.

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:18.842
A theory's acceptance, however,
is often gladiatorial.

00:02:18.842 --> 00:02:22.599
Multiple theories may compete
to supply the best explanation

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.978
of a new scientific discovery.

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:26.390
Upon further research,

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.350
scientists tend to favor the theory 
that can explain most of the data,

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.522
though there may still 
be gaps in our understanding.

00:02:34.522 --> 00:02:37.963
Scientists also like 
when a new theory successfully predicts

00:02:37.963 --> 00:02:40.834
previously unobserved phenomena,

00:02:40.834 --> 00:02:44.543
like when Dmitri Mendeleev's theory
about the periodic table

00:02:44.543 --> 00:02:48.040
predicted several undiscovered elements.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.220
The term scientific theory
covers a broad swath.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.363
Some theories are new ideas 
with little experimental evidence

00:02:55.363 --> 00:02:58.000
that scientists eye with suspicion,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.666
or even ridicule.

00:02:59.666 --> 00:03:00.976
Other theories,

00:03:00.976 --> 00:03:04.860
like those involving the Big Bang, 
evolution, and climate change,

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.156
have endured years 
of experimental confirmation

00:03:08.156 --> 00:03:13.136
before earning acceptance by the majority 
of the scientific community.

00:03:13.136 --> 00:03:16.374
You would need to learn more about
a specific explanation

00:03:16.374 --> 00:03:19.934
before you'd know how well 
scientists perceive it.

00:03:19.934 --> 00:03:23.686
The word theory
alone doesn't tell you.

00:03:23.686 --> 00:03:24.842
In full disclosure,

00:03:24.842 --> 00:03:28.339
the scientific community has bet
on the wrong horse before:

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:29.244
alchemy,

00:03:29.244 --> 00:03:30.786
the geocentric model,

00:03:30.786 --> 00:03:32.478
spontaneous generation,

00:03:32.478 --> 00:03:34.143
and the interstellar aether

00:03:34.143 --> 00:03:39.414
are just a few of many theories 
discarded in favor of better ones.

00:03:39.414 --> 00:03:42.118
But even incorrect theories 
have their value.

00:03:42.118 --> 00:03:46.411
Discredited alchemy was the birthplace
of modern chemistry,

00:03:46.411 --> 00:03:48.078
and medicine made great strides

00:03:48.078 --> 00:03:53.184
long before we understood the roles
of bacteria and viruses.

00:03:53.184 --> 00:03:57.379
That said, better theories often lead
to exciting new discoveries

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:01.343
that were unimaginable 
under the old way of thinking.

00:04:01.343 --> 00:04:04.262
Nor should we assume 
all of our current scientific theories

00:04:04.262 --> 00:04:06.596
will stand the test of time.

00:04:06.596 --> 00:04:11.052
A single unexpected result is enough
to challenge the status quo.

00:04:11.052 --> 00:04:14.962
However, vulnerability to some potentially
better explanation

00:04:14.962 --> 00:04:18.236
doesn't weaken 
a current scientific theory.

00:04:18.236 --> 00:04:23.119
Instead, it shields science from becoming
unchallenged dogma.

00:04:23.119 --> 00:04:26.744
A good scientific law 
is a finely-tuned machine,

00:04:26.744 --> 00:04:28.763
accomplishing its task brilliantly

00:04:28.763 --> 00:04:31.749
but ignorant of why it works
as well as it does.

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:36.565
A good scientific theory is a bruised,
but unbowed, fighter

00:04:36.565 --> 00:04:41.808
who risks defeat if unable to overpower
or adapt to the next challenger.

00:04:41.808 --> 00:04:43.061
Though different,

00:04:43.061 --> 00:04:47.854
science needs both laws and theories 
to understand the whole picture.

00:04:47.854 --> 00:04:51.086
So next time someone comments that
it's just a theory,

00:04:51.086 --> 00:04:53.948
challenge them to go nine rounds
with the champ

00:04:53.948 --> 00:04:55.891
and see if they can do any better.
