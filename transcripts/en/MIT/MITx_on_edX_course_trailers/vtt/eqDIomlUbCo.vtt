00:00:00.363 --> 00:00:01.090
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.650
CHRIS CAPLICE: Supply chain management
is the backbone of the global economy.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.760
Regardless of your
role within a firm you

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.910
will interface with the supply chain.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.180
Supply chains span time zones,
continents, cultures, and companies.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.870
Everything that you touch and use
came through some supply chain.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.160
The ability to manage these
far-flung and complex networks

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.990
now are seen as crucial to the
success or failure of a firm.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.000
My name is Chris Caplice and I'm
the Executive Director of the Center

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.560
for Transportation and
Logistics here at MIT.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.560
I'll be your instructor
for the course CTL.SC1x.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.430
Supply Chain and Logistics Fundamentals.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.310
This is the first of three courses
that we will offer in the XSeries

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.230
for supply chain management.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.960
So what is logistics and
supply chain management?

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.610
Basically, it's the art and
science of getting products

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.830
from where they were made to where
you the consumer want them to be.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.340
Firms have become more global in terms
of where they source materials, where

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.840
they manufacture those products and
where they sell their finished goods.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.490
And the need for professionals
who can design, manage and operate

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.610
these complex global supply
chains continues to grow.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.430
So what will you learn
if you take this course?

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.560
Basically, you'll master the
fundamental logistical concept

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.500
and build the intuition needed to
successfully manage a supply chain.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.510
And, specifically, we'll
focus on three core areas.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.850
First, we'll explore
forecasting and demand planning.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.836
This is where all supply chains start.

00:01:22.836 --> 00:01:24.710
You'll learn the strengths
and the weaknesses

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.200
of using different forecasting
methods and understand

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.000
when and how to use each of them.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.890
Second, we'll dive into
inventory management.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.710
And in this phase
you'll learn how to make

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.260
sure your products are in stock,
on the shelf and readily available

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.420
for someone to purchase.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.530
You'll learn how to
determine how much and where

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.500
to keep your products in order to make
the correct trade-off between cost

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.860
and service.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.230
Finally, we'll cover
freight transportation.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.730
We'll show how raw materials, work
in progress and finished goods

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.574
all move across the globe.

00:01:54.574 --> 00:01:57.490
You'll learn how to decide what mode
you're products should travel on.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.250
You'll learn how to calculate the
best way to distribute products

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.480
through various channels to include
large mega-retailers, smaller

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.700
neighborhood stores or
even to individual homes.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.805
I love teaching this course because the
concepts and techniques are universal.

00:02:10.805 --> 00:02:13.550
The approaches and trade-offs
that a global manufacturing

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.340
firm uses in its supply
chain also apply to how

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.240
you decide to buy your groceries.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.505
Supply chain management is
a fascinating, exciting,

00:02:20.505 --> 00:02:22.090
and growing discipline.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.560
I hope that you will decide
to join us and take the course

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.010
c Supply Chain and
Logistics Fundamentals.
