that couldn't have been created before

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:07.019
that couldn't have been created before
 

00:02:07.019 --> 00:02:09.869
that couldn't have been created before
for example we have in medicines we have

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879
for example we have in medicines we have
 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.600
for example we have in medicines we have
the

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610
the
 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.400

great number they say even twenty-five

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410
great number they say even twenty-five
 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.400
great number they say even twenty-five
percent of all medicines that are made

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410
percent of all medicines that are made
 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.310
percent of all medicines that are made
synthesized today are made by one of

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320
synthesized today are made by one of
 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.710
synthesized today are made by one of
these reactions so it's a huge impact on

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720
these reactions so it's a huge impact on
 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.680
these reactions so it's a huge impact on
on the pharmaceutical industry and so

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690
on the pharmaceutical industry and so
 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.770
on the pharmaceutical industry and so
how does this work well the trick is

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780
how does this work well the trick is
 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.170
how does this work well the trick is
that carbons are rather unreactive by

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180
that carbons are rather unreactive by
 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.880
that carbons are rather unreactive by
themselves but if you bring in close

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890
themselves but if you bring in close
 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.940
themselves but if you bring in close
enough together then they can react and

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950
enough together then they can react and
 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.970
enough together then they can react and
palladium has this magic property that

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980
palladium has this magic property that
 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.220
palladium has this magic property that
it can bind to different carbons and

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230
it can bind to different carbons and
 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.680
it can bind to different carbons and
make them come very close together and

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690
make them come very close together and
 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.390
make them come very close together and
then they react on the very mild

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400
then they react on the very mild
 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.970
then they react on the very mild
conditions so it brings carbon atoms

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980
conditions so it brings carbon atoms
 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.040
conditions so it brings carbon atoms
together which allows them to react and

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050
together which allows them to react and
 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.190
together which allows them to react and
Bowl together yes exactly and so could

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200
Bowl together yes exactly and so could
 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.230
Bowl together yes exactly and so could

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.050
chemistry in in Germany which showed
that you can use palladium as a catalyst

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060
that you can use palladium as a catalyst
 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.260
that you can use palladium as a catalyst
for different reactions and he further

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270
for different reactions and he further
 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.990
for different reactions and he further
developed that and made it into a

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000
developed that and made it into a
 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.690
developed that and made it into a
process that worked for making

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700
process that worked for making
 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.920
process that worked for making
carbon-carbon bonds in many different

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930
carbon-carbon bonds in many different
 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.920
carbon-carbon bonds in many different
examples and then the other two made

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930
examples and then the other two made
 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.780
examples and then the other two made
because his reaction cannot be applied

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790
because his reaction cannot be applied
 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.540
because his reaction cannot be applied
to all kind of compounds so then they

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550
to all kind of compounds so then they
 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.759
to all kind of compounds so then they
complement this by finding other way so

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769
complement this by finding other way so
 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.460
complement this by finding other way so
you can make it broader so you can work

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470
you can make it broader so you can work
 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.560
you can make it broader so you can work
with all kind of different organic

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570
with all kind of different organic
 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.680
with all kind of different organic
compounds and under what conditions this

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690
compounds and under what conditions this
 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.140

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040
conditions you say you don't need any
 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.400
conditions you say you don't need any
high pressure high temperature something

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410
high pressure high temperature something
 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.800
high pressure high temperature something
so it can it's a mild temperatures and

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810
so it can it's a mild temperatures and
 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.520
so it can it's a mild temperatures and
and not strange solvents and things like

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530
and not strange solvents and things like
 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.710
and not strange solvents and things like
this and that makes it it doesn't create

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720
this and that makes it it doesn't create
 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.670
this and that makes it it doesn't create
as much waste product and like normal

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680
as much waste product and like normal
 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.590

chemical senses you get a lot of things

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600
chemical senses you get a lot of things
 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.420
chemical senses you get a lot of things
you have to take care of but boron and

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430
you have to take care of but boron and
 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.100
you have to take care of but boron and
sink and so on they are not very toxic

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110
sink and so on they are not very toxic
 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.280
sink and so on they are not very toxic
so it's an idea thing for scaling up in

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290
so it's an idea thing for scaling up in
 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.220
so it's an idea thing for scaling up in
industry and could you give a sense of

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230
industry and could you give a sense of
 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.500
industry and could you give a sense of
when these discoveries were made when

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510
when these discoveries were made when
 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.030
when these discoveries were made when
was this method developed and refined

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040
was this method developed and refined
 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.970
was this method developed and refined
the first one was almost 40 years ago

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980
the first one was almost 40 years ago
 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.250
the first one was almost 40 years ago
hex reactions and the other ones what

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260
hex reactions and the other ones what
 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.159
hex reactions and the other ones what
about 30 years ago and then it took all

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169
about 30 years ago and then it took all
 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.279
about 30 years ago and then it took all
the way up to nineteen ninety before

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289
the way up to nineteen ninety before
 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:24.510
the way up to nineteen ninety before
people really start

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520
people really start
 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.580
people really start
realize how great these things were and

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590
realize how great these things were and
 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.969
realize how great these things were and
then it is just developed very quickly

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979
then it is just developed very quickly
 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.430
then it is just developed very quickly
and so you mentioned pharmaceuticals but

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440
and so you mentioned pharmaceuticals but
 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.619
and so you mentioned pharmaceuticals but
could you give us an idea of of other

00:04:34.619 --> 00:04:34.629
could you give us an idea of of other
 

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:37.230
could you give us an idea of of other
chemicals that are made yes a lot of

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240
chemicals that are made yes a lot of
 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.390
chemicals that are made yes a lot of
agriculture products you know for

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400
agriculture products you know for
 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.820
agriculture products you know for
example to keep a fan di away from

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830
example to keep a fan di away from
 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.909
example to keep a fan di away from
grapes and things like this and then in

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919
grapes and things like this and then in
 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.939
grapes and things like this and then in
plastic industry onion electronics to

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:47.949
plastic industry onion electronics to
 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:50.850
plastic industry onion electronics to
code chips and to make light emitting

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860
code chips and to make light emitting
 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.320
code chips and to make light emitting
compounds and so on so it's a very

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330
compounds and so on so it's a very
 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.270
compounds and so on so it's a very
general thing you can use it all over

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280
general thing you can use it all over
 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.899
general thing you can use it all over
and so you mentioned that the work was

00:04:57.899 --> 00:04:57.909
and so you mentioned that the work was
 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:00.960
and so you mentioned that the work was
done decades ago and the price is being

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970
done decades ago and the price is being
 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.629
done decades ago and the price is being
awarded in the year 2010 what

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639
awarded in the year 2010 what
 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:05.189
awarded in the year 2010 what
developments have they been that made

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199
developments have they been that made
 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:07.170
developments have they been that made
the case for this subject it to be the

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180
the case for this subject it to be the
 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.689
the case for this subject it to be the
prize so convincing this year well we

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699
prize so convincing this year well we
 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:11.760
prize so convincing this year well we
have of course looked at this for quite

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770
have of course looked at this for quite
 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.670
have of course looked at this for quite
a long time now and and but it is a very

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680
a long time now and and but it is a very
 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.980
a long time now and and but it is a very
complicated feed and very many players

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990
complicated feed and very many players
 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.499
complicated feed and very many players
and it took us quite a while to really

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:19.509
and it took us quite a while to really
 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:22.559
and it took us quite a while to really
sort out who was the real first ones and

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:22.569
sort out who was the real first ones and
 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:24.450
sort out who was the real first ones and
the ones versi of the price so that's

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460
the ones versi of the price so that's
 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.170
the ones versi of the price so that's
why it took some time so there are many

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180
why it took some time so there are many
 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.290
why it took some time so there are many
players involved and so I you say it

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300
players involved and so I you say it
 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.029
players involved and so I you say it
took some time to make the decision so

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039
took some time to make the decision so
 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:35.550
took some time to make the decision so
could you go into what the the

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560
could you go into what the the
 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.950
could you go into what the the
committee's rationale was for for

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960
committee's rationale was for for
 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.480
committee's rationale was for for
focusing on the achievements of these

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490
focusing on the achievements of these
 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.320
focusing on the achievements of these
particular chemists in question I mean

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330
particular chemists in question I mean
 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.570
particular chemists in question I mean
of course we make searches you know we

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580
of course we make searches you know we
 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.399
of course we make searches you know we
get nominations and then we order

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:47.409
get nominations and then we order
 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:49.980
get nominations and then we order
investigations from different earlier

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990
investigations from different earlier
 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.420
investigations from different earlier
laureates and so on and let me try to

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430
laureates and so on and let me try to
 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.089
laureates and so on and let me try to
get this together to a coherent picture

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:54.099
get this together to a coherent picture
 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:56.700
get this together to a coherent picture
who should be the best one for this year

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710
who should be the best one for this year
 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.490
who should be the best one for this year
and and we should give the price to the

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500
and and we should give the price to the
 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.040
and and we should give the price to the
best discovery or improvement in

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050
best discovery or improvement in
 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.930
best discovery or improvement in
chemistry and we think this year this

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940
chemistry and we think this year this
 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.469
chemistry and we think this year this
was clearly this thing if you look at

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:07.479
was clearly this thing if you look at
 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:09.240
was clearly this thing if you look at
the three Lords achievements you say

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250
the three Lords achievements you say
 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.100
the three Lords achievements you say
those three achievements from each of

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110
those three achievements from each of
 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.140
those three achievements from each of
the Lord's were the key moments in the

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.150
the Lord's were the key moments in the
 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.730
the Lord's were the key moments in the
development and refinement of this

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740
development and refinement of this
 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.649
development and refinement of this
technique yes and they were quite

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:16.659
technique yes and they were quite
 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:18.749
technique yes and they were quite
independent they haven't been postdoc to

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:18.759
independent they haven't been postdoc to
 

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:20.010
independent they haven't been postdoc to
each other or something so they were

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.020
each other or something so they were
 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.170
each other or something so they were
completely independent in different

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:22.180
completely independent in different
 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.240
completely independent in different
parts of the world we think this is very

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.250
parts of the world we think this is very
 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.939
parts of the world we think this is very
great and my final question is have you

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:26.949
great and my final question is have you
 

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:28.140
great and my final question is have you
spoken to laureates

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150
spoken to laureates
 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.150
spoken to laureates
yes we spoke to them through the

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160
yes we spoke to them through the
 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.710
yes we spoke to them through the
telephone this morning we could reach
