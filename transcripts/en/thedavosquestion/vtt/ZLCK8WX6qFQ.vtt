00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:05.439
So I'm Matthieu Ricard, a Buddhist monk, I
live since 40 years in the Himalayas and the

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:09.590
French interpreter for the Dalai-Lama. So
I'm here in Davos, which is quite surprising

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:15.570
for a Buddhist monk. What I think w can contribute
is to realize what Gandhi said is there is

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.529
enough for everyone's need but there is not
enough for everyone's greed. And I think one

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:29.570
lesson that the present crisis can teach us
is that just the pursuit of self's happiness

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.510
is about to fail. Especially when it's corrupted
with greed. And the lesson that we can take

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.700
from this crisis is that we need to work forward
toward the more altruistic side. More altruistic

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.829
like dealing with people's investments. Not
like what we are doing with the casino. Be

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.719
more concerned and altruistic against peole
flourishing in life. The way the work, the

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.629
environment. And more altruistic for future
generations and what they can care of the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.649
environment. So it seems that altruism or
a more altruistic society is the single answer

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:09.679
to all those three kinds of care. And that
is not sort of an interpret view or idealist

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:15.310
view, but is really in tune to the independence
of the world. So if we can understand the

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.109
proposition of interdependence and seek a
win win situation of exploiting orders, I

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:25.389
think people will have taken serious lessons
from this economic crisis.
