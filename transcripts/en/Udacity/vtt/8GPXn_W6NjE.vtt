00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So congratulations!

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
You've learned about confidence intervals and this is a really cool tool to use

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
when making conclusions from sample data.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It's much better to say here's the mean and here is how confident I am about

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
indicating the interval than just giving the mean, and you learned that the interval size shrinks

00:00:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
as the sample size increases--so eventually, if you have lots of data, we get more and more confident.
