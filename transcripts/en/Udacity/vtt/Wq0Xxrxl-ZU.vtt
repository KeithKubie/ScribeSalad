Great. So now, looked at this way, you can

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.540
think of the k means procedure as actually moving around

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.230
in the space and it follows one of the

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.030
optimization algorithms that we talked about. So here's three of

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.370
the algorithms that we talked about: hill climbing, genetic

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.060
algorithms and simulated annealing. These

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.240
are all randomized, optimization algorithms

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.010
and one of these is kind of a lot like K means so which one do you think it is?

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.540
&gt;&gt; Okay let me think about it.
