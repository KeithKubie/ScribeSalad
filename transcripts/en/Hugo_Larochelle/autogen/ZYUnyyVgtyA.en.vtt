00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.510
in this video we'll introduce the notion

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520
in this video we'll introduce the notion
 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.800
in this video we'll introduce the notion
of a Markov network we've seen before

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810
of a Markov network we've seen before
 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.810
of a Markov network we've seen before
that a conditional random field can be

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820
that a conditional random field can be
 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.290
that a conditional random field can be
written in a slightly different form we

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300
written in a slightly different form we
 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.580
written in a slightly different form we
seen before as essentially a product of

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590
seen before as essentially a product of
 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.890
seen before as essentially a product of
some factors and in the case of the

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900
some factors and in the case of the
 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.720
some factors and in the case of the
linear chain conditional random field

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730
linear chain conditional random field
 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.109
linear chain conditional random field
where we have unary potentials which

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119
where we have unary potentials which
 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.330
where we have unary potentials which
correspond to neural networks then these

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340
correspond to neural networks then these
 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.720
correspond to neural networks then these
factors would corresponds to would

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730
factors would corresponds to would
 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.460
factors would corresponds to would
correspond to these terms here we have

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470
correspond to these terms here we have
 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.010
correspond to these terms here we have
unary factors so the factors that

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020
unary factors so the factors that
 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.979
unary factors so the factors that
involve a single Y and pairwise factors

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989
involve a single Y and pairwise factors
 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.090
involve a single Y and pairwise factors
where this factor involves two adjacent

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100
where this factor involves two adjacent
 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.190
where this factor involves two adjacent
labels two y's so these would be the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200
labels two y's so these would be the
 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.260
labels two y's so these would be the
unary factors this will be the pairwise

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270
unary factors this will be the pairwise
 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.090
unary factors this will be the pairwise
factors a very useful visualization of a

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100
factors a very useful visualization of a
 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.220

given conditional random field model is
 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.430
given conditional random field model is
known as the Markov network so it's a

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440
known as the Markov network so it's a
 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.619

network where the nodes are the random

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629
network where the nodes are the random
 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.740

network for a conditional random field

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490
network for a conditional random field
 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.460
network for a conditional random field
which we've written as a product of

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470
which we've written as a product of
 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.550
which we've written as a product of
factors is that first we would write all

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560
factors is that first we would write all
 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.670
factors is that first we would write all
of the different so we have a node for

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680
of the different so we have a node for
 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.340
of the different so we have a node for
each of the random variable in our

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350
each of the random variable in our
 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.830
each of the random variable in our
models in our case each of the labels if

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840
models in our case each of the labels if
 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.160
models in our case each of the labels if
we had a sequence of length 5 then we

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170
we had a sequence of length 5 then we
 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.810
we had a sequence of length 5 then we
have y 1 y 2 y 3 y 4 y 5 as well as a

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820
have y 1 y 2 y 3 y 4 y 5 as well as a
 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.569
have y 1 y 2 y 3 y 4 y 5 as well as a
node in this case for each of the input

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579
node in this case for each of the input
 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.819
node in this case for each of the input
vector X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 and X 5 so now

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829
vector X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 and X 5 so now
 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.780
vector X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 and X 5 so now
then we would add edges for between each

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790
then we would add edges for between each
 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.749
then we would add edges for between each
random variable that shares a factor in

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759
random variable that shares a factor in
 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.719
random variable that shares a factor in
the product of factor form for our

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729
the product of factor form for our
 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.969
the product of factor form for our
conditional random field for the linear

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979
conditional random field for the linear
 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.730
conditional random field for the linear
chain conditional random field then this

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740
chain conditional random field then this
 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.060
chain conditional random field then this
means that we would have and also for a

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070
means that we would have and also for a
 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.169
means that we would have and also for a
context size of radius 1 context window

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179
context size of radius 1 context window
 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.449
context size of radius 1 context window
grid is 1 then we'd have these diagonal

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459
grid is 1 then we'd have these diagonal
 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.040
grid is 1 then we'd have these diagonal
edges between a

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050
edges between a
 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.930
edges between a
label why and its input at its left so

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940
label why and its input at its left so
 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.400
label why and its input at its left so
then we have also an edge between each

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410
then we have also an edge between each
 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.640
then we have also an edge between each
label and the input at the same position

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650
label and the input at the same position
 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.590
label and the input at the same position
so those are the vertical edges here and

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600
so those are the vertical edges here and
 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.920
so those are the vertical edges here and
similarly we'd have edges diagonal edges

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930
similarly we'd have edges diagonal edges
 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.040
similarly we'd have edges diagonal edges
like this between hy and the label to

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050
like this between hy and the label to
 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.350
like this between hy and the label to
its right so those correspond to the

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360
its right so those correspond to the
 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.220
its right so those correspond to the
this factor here the factor between YK

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230
this factor here the factor between YK
 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.150
this factor here the factor between YK
and XK plus 1 so those were all the

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160
and XK plus 1 so those were all the
 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.860
and XK plus 1 so those were all the
unary factors and then for the pairwise

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870
unary factors and then for the pairwise
 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.540
unary factors and then for the pairwise
factors they would correspond to the

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550
factors they would correspond to the
 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.400
factors they would correspond to the
original edges here between H YK and its

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410
original edges here between H YK and its
 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:03.160
original edges here between H YK and its
neighbour YK plus 1 so what's useful

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170
neighbour YK plus 1 so what's useful
 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.660
neighbour YK plus 1 so what's useful

distribution over y 3 given these five
 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.879
distribution over y 3 given these five
nodes actually does not depend on y 1 so

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889
nodes actually does not depend on y 1 so
 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.760
nodes actually does not depend on y 1 so
I can just ignore ignore it and compute

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770
I can just ignore ignore it and compute
 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.100
I can just ignore ignore it and compute

even a bit more general which is if I

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150
even a bit more general which is if I
 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.490
even a bit more general which is if I
have two nodes well then there are going

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500
have two nodes well then there are going
 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.460

to be conditionally independent if all

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470
to be conditionally independent if all
 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.180
to be conditionally independent if all
the paths between the two nodes contain

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190
the paths between the two nodes contain
 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.029
the paths between the two nodes contain
at least one of the conditioning node so

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039
at least one of the conditioning node so
 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:33.770
at least one of the conditioning node so
one of the node that that I might be

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780
one of the node that that I might be
 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.760
one of the node that that I might be
observing and I'm conditioning over so

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770
observing and I'm conditioning over so
 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.129
observing and I'm conditioning over so
for instance if I'm wondering so imagine

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139
for instance if I'm wondering so imagine
 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.490
for instance if I'm wondering so imagine
in the conditional anything again at

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500
in the conditional anything again at
 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.010
in the conditional anything again at
when we use it while these observe all

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020
when we use it while these observe all
 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.760
when we use it while these observe all
the input now I imagine that I'm also

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770
the input now I imagine that I'm also
 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.270
the input now I imagine that I'm also
observing Y 3 and I want to know whether

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280
observing Y 3 and I want to know whether
 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.620
observing Y 3 and I want to know whether
Y 1 depends on Y 5 in this case there's

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630
Y 1 depends on Y 5 in this case there's
 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:02.360
Y 1 depends on Y 5 in this case there's
one path between y 1 and Wi-Fi so it's

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370
one path between y 1 and Wi-Fi so it's
 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.219
one path between y 1 and Wi-Fi so it's
this path actually I could there are

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:04.229
this path actually I could there are
 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:06.589
this path actually I could there are
other paths I could go like this so

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599
other paths I could go like this so
 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:07.969
other paths I could go like this so
there's more than one path I could go

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:07.979
there's more than one path I could go
 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:10.159
there's more than one path I could go
like this and like that and so on

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169
like this and like that and so on
 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:12.409
like this and like that and so on
well it turns out in this case we can

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419
well it turns out in this case we can
 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:16.430
well it turns out in this case we can
easily see that each path between y 1

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440
easily see that each path between y 1
 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.740
easily see that each path between y 1
and Wi-Fi actually contains one of the

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750
and Wi-Fi actually contains one of the
 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.080
and Wi-Fi actually contains one of the
note I'm conditioning on that is it

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090
note I'm conditioning on that is it
 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.210
note I'm conditioning on that is it
either contains one of the inputs so

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220
either contains one of the inputs so
 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.540
either contains one of the inputs so
each path that goes through an X node

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:25.550
each path that goes through an X node
 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.890
each path that goes through an X node
would be blocked by by the X know that's

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900
would be blocked by by the X know that's
 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.839
would be blocked by by the X know that's
observed that I'm conditioning on and if

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:32.849
observed that I'm conditioning on and if
 

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:34.820
observed that I'm conditioning on and if
I'm assuming I'm also observing this

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:34.830
I'm assuming I'm also observing this
 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.250
I'm assuming I'm also observing this
well then any node that stays up like

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:37.260
well then any node that stays up like
 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.629
well then any node that stays up like
this and goes through y3

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:39.639
this and goes through y3
 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:42.029
this and goes through y3
is going to contain conditioning notes

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:42.039
is going to contain conditioning notes
 

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:43.920
is going to contain conditioning notes
so it's going to be blocked in a sense

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:43.930
so it's going to be blocked in a sense
 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.110
so it's going to be blocked in a sense
and so for that reason we could say that

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:46.120
and so for that reason we could say that
 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.790
and so for that reason we could say that
y1 and Wi-Fi is is independent

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800
y1 and Wi-Fi is is independent
 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.730
y1 and Wi-Fi is is independent
conditionally independent given x1 up to

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:53.740
conditionally independent given x1 up to
 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:58.619
conditionally independent given x1 up to
X 5 and y3 so that's a useful property

00:06:58.619 --> 00:06:58.629
X 5 and y3 so that's a useful property
 

00:06:58.629 --> 00:07:01.350
X 5 and y3 so that's a useful property
of the mark up network it allows us to

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.360
of the mark up network it allows us to
 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.719
of the mark up network it allows us to
identify a lot of conditional

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:03.729
identify a lot of conditional
 

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:10.260
identify a lot of conditional
independencies very easily another thing

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:10.270
independencies very easily another thing
 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.850
independencies very easily another thing
that's important to understand about

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:11.860
that's important to understand about
 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.260
that's important to understand about
conditional random fields is that

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:13.270
conditional random fields is that
 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.689
conditional random fields is that
they're known as undirected graphical

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:15.699
they're known as undirected graphical
 

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:20.700
they're known as undirected graphical
models to be distinguished from directed

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:20.710
models to be distinguished from directed
 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.499
models to be distinguished from directed
graphical models like a hidden Markov

00:07:22.499 --> 00:07:22.509
graphical models like a hidden Markov
 

00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:24.570
graphical models like a hidden Markov
networks and Bayesian networks in

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:24.580

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.140
networks and Bayesian networks in
general and so what this means is that

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:28.150
general and so what this means is that
 

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.050
general and so what this means is that
when I write it in the form of a product

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:31.060
when I write it in the form of a product
 

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.350
when I write it in the form of a product
of factors well all of the factors so

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:34.360
of factors well all of the factors so
 

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.390
of factors well all of the factors so
I'm giving an example here where we are

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:36.400
I'm giving an example here where we are
 

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.689
I'm giving an example here where we are

context window or contact window of size

00:07:42.659 --> 00:07:42.669

1 that only contains the input at the

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:45.310
1 that only contains the input at the
 

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.279
1 that only contains the input at the
current position so in this case I only

00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:47.289
current position so in this case I only
 

00:07:47.289 --> 00:07:49.050
current position so in this case I only
have can think of this as only

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:49.060
have can think of this as only
 

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:53.189
have can think of this as only
containing two types of factors well in

00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:53.199
containing two types of factors well in
 

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:54.899
containing two types of factors well in
this case in the in the conditional

00:07:54.899 --> 00:07:54.909
this case in the in the conditional
 

00:07:54.909 --> 00:07:56.909
this case in the in the conditional
random field these factors only need to

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:56.919
random field these factors only need to
 

00:07:56.919 --> 00:07:58.950
random field these factors only need to
be non-negative so they need to be

00:07:58.950 --> 00:07:58.960
be non-negative so they need to be
 

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.100
be non-negative so they need to be
greater or equal to zero that's the only

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:02.110
greater or equal to zero that's the only
 

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:04.439
greater or equal to zero that's the only
requirement that I have in an undirected

00:08:04.439 --> 00:08:04.449
requirement that I have in an undirected
 

00:08:04.449 --> 00:08:06.899
requirement that I have in an undirected
graphical model is that when I write it

00:08:06.899 --> 00:08:06.909
graphical model is that when I write it
 

00:08:06.909 --> 00:08:11.879
graphical model is that when I write it
as a product of the factors well the

00:08:11.879 --> 00:08:11.889
as a product of the factors well the
 

00:08:11.889 --> 00:08:14.339
as a product of the factors well the
factors themselves they only need to be

00:08:14.339 --> 00:08:14.349
factors themselves they only need to be
 

00:08:14.349 --> 00:08:16.499
factors themselves they only need to be
such that there are always greater and

00:08:16.499 --> 00:08:16.509
such that there are always greater and
 

00:08:16.509 --> 00:08:20.219
such that there are always greater and
equal than zero so that's to be

00:08:20.219 --> 00:08:20.229
equal than zero so that's to be
 

00:08:20.229 --> 00:08:24.570
equal than zero so that's to be
contrasted with a hidden Markov model so

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:24.580
contrasted with a hidden Markov model so
 

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.369
contrasted with a hidden Markov model so
if we visualize it as a Bayesian network

00:08:26.369 --> 00:08:26.379
if we visualize it as a Bayesian network
 

00:08:26.379 --> 00:08:28.589
if we visualize it as a Bayesian network
that is a network where the nodes are

00:08:28.589 --> 00:08:28.599
that is a network where the nodes are
 

00:08:28.599 --> 00:08:31.019
that is a network where the nodes are
the random variables and the edges are

00:08:31.019 --> 00:08:31.029
the random variables and the edges are
 

00:08:31.029 --> 00:08:35.579
the random variables and the edges are
now directed well each edge in this case

00:08:35.579 --> 00:08:35.589
now directed well each edge in this case
 

00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:38.189
now directed well each edge in this case
corresponds to a conditional probability

00:08:38.189 --> 00:08:38.199
corresponds to a conditional probability
 

00:08:38.199 --> 00:08:40.649
corresponds to a conditional probability
in the model that's a property of a

00:08:40.649 --> 00:08:40.659
in the model that's a property of a
 

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:43.259
in the model that's a property of a
Bayesian network in this case for a

00:08:43.259 --> 00:08:43.269
Bayesian network in this case for a
 

00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:47.490
Bayesian network in this case for a
hidden Markov model the this arrow here

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:47.500
hidden Markov model the this arrow here
 

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.280
hidden Markov model the this arrow here
would correspond to the conditional

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:50.290
would correspond to the conditional
 

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:53.490
would correspond to the conditional
would illustrate that

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:53.500
 

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.749
with corresponding conditional

00:08:54.749 --> 00:08:54.759
with corresponding conditional
 

00:08:54.759 --> 00:08:59.910
with corresponding conditional
probability of y2 given y1 and also X to

00:08:59.910 --> 00:08:59.920
probability of y2 given y1 and also X to
 

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.819
probability of y2 given y1 and also X to
the arrow from y2 2 x2 would correspond

00:09:02.819 --> 00:09:02.829
the arrow from y2 2 x2 would correspond
 

00:09:02.829 --> 00:09:04.650
the arrow from y2 2 x2 would correspond
to the conditional probability of x2

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:04.660
to the conditional probability of x2
 

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.679
to the conditional probability of x2
given y2 so the arrows what are they are

00:09:07.679 --> 00:09:07.689
given y2 so the arrows what are they are
 

00:09:07.689 --> 00:09:11.069
given y2 so the arrows what are they are
saying essentially is that in the

00:09:11.069 --> 00:09:11.079
saying essentially is that in the
 

00:09:11.079 --> 00:09:13.920
saying essentially is that in the
genitive story behind the model y2 was

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:13.930
genitive story behind the model y2 was
 

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:17.759
genitive story behind the model y2 was
generated based on y1 only and then x2

00:09:17.759 --> 00:09:17.769
generated based on y1 only and then x2
 

00:09:17.769 --> 00:09:23.569
generated based on y1 only and then x2
was generated based on y2 only so

00:09:23.569 --> 00:09:23.579
was generated based on y2 only so
 

00:09:23.579 --> 00:09:26.160
was generated based on y2 only so
because now if you write in factored

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:26.170
because now if you write in factored
 

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:29.220
because now if you write in factored
form then all the factors will

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:29.230
form then all the factors will
 

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:31.110
form then all the factors will
correspond to these probability

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:31.120
correspond to these probability
 

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:35.309
correspond to these probability
distributions and it means that we do

00:09:35.309 --> 00:09:35.319
distributions and it means that we do
 

00:09:35.319 --> 00:09:37.379
distributions and it means that we do
satisfy the fact that these because

00:09:37.379 --> 00:09:37.389
satisfy the fact that these because
 

00:09:37.389 --> 00:09:39.030
satisfy the fact that these because
their probability distributions they're

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.040
their probability distributions they're
 

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.769
their probability distributions they're
going to be greater and equal than 0

00:09:40.769 --> 00:09:40.779
going to be greater and equal than 0
 

00:09:40.779 --> 00:09:43.769
going to be greater and equal than 0
however in a director graphical model

00:09:43.769 --> 00:09:43.779
however in a director graphical model
 

00:09:43.779 --> 00:09:46.679
however in a director graphical model
the factors also need to sum to one with

00:09:46.679 --> 00:09:46.689
the factors also need to sum to one with
 

00:09:46.689 --> 00:09:49.889
the factors also need to sum to one with
respect to one of the arguments here so

00:09:49.889 --> 00:09:49.899
respect to one of the arguments here so
 

00:09:49.899 --> 00:09:52.199
respect to one of the arguments here so
for instance this factor would sum to 1

00:09:52.199 --> 00:09:52.209
for instance this factor would sum to 1
 

00:09:52.209 --> 00:09:55.800
for instance this factor would sum to 1
with respect to X K because it's a

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:55.810
with respect to X K because it's a
 

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:57.269
with respect to X K because it's a
conditional probability so this

00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:57.279
conditional probability so this
 

00:09:57.279 --> 00:09:59.879
conditional probability so this
distribution over X K and similarly this

00:09:59.879 --> 00:09:59.889
distribution over X K and similarly this
 

00:09:59.889 --> 00:10:02.460
distribution over X K and similarly this
factor between pairs of labels with

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:02.470
factor between pairs of labels with
 

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:04.590
factor between pairs of labels with
something 1 with respect to YK plus 1

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:04.600
something 1 with respect to YK plus 1
 

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.150
something 1 with respect to YK plus 1
because it's a conditional distribution

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:06.160
because it's a conditional distribution
 

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.679
because it's a conditional distribution
over YK plus 1 ok so that's an important

00:10:10.679 --> 00:10:10.689
over YK plus 1 ok so that's an important
 

00:10:10.689 --> 00:10:13.949
over YK plus 1 ok so that's an important
distinction between a directed graphical

00:10:17.649 --> 00:10:19.980
random field which is an undirected
graphical model so now the edges do not

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:19.990
graphical model so now the edges do not
 

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:22.920

correspond to conditional distributions

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:22.930
correspond to conditional distributions
 

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:26.790

they just come on to factors or their

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:26.800
they just come on to factors or their
 

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.590
they just come on to factors or their
associated to factor with factors or

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:28.600

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.780
associated to factor with factors or
combated compatibility function we just

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:30.790
combated compatibility function we just
 

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:33.840
combated compatibility function we just
express a preference for the values that

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:33.850
express a preference for the values that
 

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:36.569
express a preference for the values that
can take each of the random variable in

00:10:36.569 --> 00:10:36.579
can take each of the random variable in
 

00:10:36.579 --> 00:10:39.499
can take each of the random variable in
the factor of compatibility function and

00:10:39.499 --> 00:10:39.509
the factor of compatibility function and
 

00:10:39.509 --> 00:10:43.049
the factor of compatibility function and
in particular if we were to try to

00:10:43.049 --> 00:10:43.059
in particular if we were to try to
 

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:46.079

00:10:46.089 --> 00:10:48.629
identify conditional independencies in
the directed graphical model and so from

00:10:48.629 --> 00:10:48.639
the directed graphical model and so from
 

00:10:48.639 --> 00:10:50.879
the directed graphical model and so from
the Bayesian network it would actually

00:10:50.889 --> 00:10:52.769
the Bayesian network it would actually
be more complicated so there is the D
