00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079
it's actually a pretty obnoxious top of
 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:13.780
it's actually a pretty obnoxious top of
the times and every time I try to like

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790
the times and every time I try to like
 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.270
the times and every time I try to like

saved okay yeah so so it immediately

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410
saved okay yeah so so it immediately
 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.220
saved okay yeah so so it immediately
loses all progress immediately exits the

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230
loses all progress immediately exits the
 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.539
loses all progress immediately exits the
game and this is actually the default

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549
game and this is actually the default
 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.750

screen time we have the game itself just
 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.370
screen time we have the game itself just
exiting doesn't really help and also

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380
exiting doesn't really help and also
 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.349
exiting doesn't really help and also
losing all state could be very very

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359
losing all state could be very very
 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:39.610
losing all state could be very very
frustrating if you're in the middle of

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620
frustrating if you're in the middle of
 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.640
frustrating if you're in the middle of
one of these levels and here is an

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650
one of these levels and here is an
 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.170
one of these levels and here is an
example word push level and it's

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180
example word push level and it's
 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.089
example word push level and it's
actually the game is super super clever

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:49.099
actually the game is super super clever
 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:50.530
actually the game is super super clever
one thing it's also interesting about

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540
one thing it's also interesting about
 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.350
one thing it's also interesting about
this game for me is that there is

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360
this game for me is that there is
 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.830
this game for me is that there is
a large sense of complete randomness to

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840
a large sense of complete randomness to
 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.230
a large sense of complete randomness to
the game as is how close these blocks

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.240
the game as is how close these blocks
 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.450
the game as is how close these blocks
are to each other so the goal in this

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460
are to each other so the goal in this
 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.950
are to each other so the goal in this
particular level by the way is to build

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960
particular level by the way is to build
 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.550
particular level by the way is to build
one word using the blue blocks and they

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560
one word using the blue blocks and they
 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.350
one word using the blue blocks and they
must be used to actually it's using the

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360
must be used to actually it's using the
 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.000
must be used to actually it's using the
orange blocks and so the blue blocks

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010
orange blocks and so the blue blocks
 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.260
orange blocks and so the blue blocks
actually gives you additional monta but

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270
actually gives you additional monta but
 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.880
actually gives you additional monta but
to complete a level you actually need to

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890
to complete a level you actually need to
 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.770
to complete a level you actually need to
hit get make a word with the orange box

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780
hit get make a word with the orange box
 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.530
hit get make a word with the orange box
icic okay in that case and you used it

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540
icic okay in that case and you used it
 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.090
icic okay in that case and you used it
to keep anyway the point is if you use

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100
to keep anyway the point is if you use
 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.830
to keep anyway the point is if you use
the blue blocks they actually have to be

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840
the blue blocks they actually have to be
 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.130
the blue blocks they actually have to be
used together and and so that's that it

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140
used together and and so that's that it
 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.750
used together and and so that's that it
does make things kind of turkey so okay

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760
does make things kind of turkey so okay
 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.550
does make things kind of turkey so okay
so you can see I played this game a lot

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560
so you can see I played this game a lot
 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.930
so you can see I played this game a lot
um clearly today okay all our word games

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940
um clearly today okay all our word games
 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.530
um clearly today okay all our word games
are almost the same to us at this point

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540
are almost the same to us at this point
 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.630
are almost the same to us at this point
so yeah so and you can actually and you

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640
so yeah so and you can actually and you
 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.550
so yeah so and you can actually and you
can move the other letters out of the

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560
can move the other letters out of the
 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.440
can move the other letters out of the
way in different directions by selecting

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450
way in different directions by selecting
 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.050
way in different directions by selecting
top left right or bottom yeah and it has

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060
top left right or bottom yeah and it has
 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.220
top left right or bottom yeah and it has
a nice little animation one of things

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230
a nice little animation one of things
 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:45.630
a nice little animation one of things
that's a little bit unclear is it if you

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640
that's a little bit unclear is it if you
 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.790
that's a little bit unclear is it if you
don't want the the video how to play

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800
don't want the the video how to play
 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.220
don't want the the video how to play
intro that is built into the game and

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230
intro that is built into the game and
 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.080
intro that is built into the game and
some of these things may elude you in

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090
some of these things may elude you in
 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.090
some of these things may elude you in
the in terms of the controls and it

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100
the in terms of the controls and it
 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.550
the in terms of the controls and it
still got a little bit confusing as to

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560
still got a little bit confusing as to
 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.800
still got a little bit confusing as to
what top left right and bottom mean in

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810
what top left right and bottom mean in
 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.050
what top left right and bottom mean in
terms of push direction I think it's one

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060
terms of push direction I think it's one
 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.130
terms of push direction I think it's one
of the things that could be made a lot

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140
of the things that could be made a lot
 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.680
of the things that could be made a lot
clearer in the game itself perhaps a

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690
clearer in the game itself perhaps a
 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.630
clearer in the game itself perhaps a
direction indicator I think right yeah

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640
direction indicator I think right yeah
 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.080
direction indicator I think right yeah
you know Shaw and arrow on the board or

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090
you know Shaw and arrow on the board or
 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.250
you know Shaw and arrow on the board or
something showing you the way the

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260
something showing you the way the
 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.630
something showing you the way the
letters are going to move and we said

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640
letters are going to move and we said
 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.740
letters are going to move and we said
you're actually to care it's really what

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750
you're actually to care it's really what
 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.240
you're actually to care it's really what
happens when you move things out of the

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250
happens when you move things out of the
 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.190
happens when you move things out of the
way so now we are at top direction right

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200
way so now we are at top direction right
 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.430
way so now we are at top direction right
and sea kraits oh yeah English it's okay

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440
and sea kraits oh yeah English it's okay
 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.820
and sea kraits oh yeah English it's okay
i know i put Dame I didn't like the age

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830
 
 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.060
 
okay let's let's try tan okay you see

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070
okay let's let's try tan okay you see
 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.090
okay let's let's try tan okay you see
now top moves the letters from the top

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100
now top moves the letters from the top
 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.550
now top moves the letters from the top
down oh yeah right okay that's and

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560
down oh yeah right okay that's and
 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.350
down oh yeah right okay that's and
that's that's again it's not necessarily

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360
that's that's again it's not necessarily
 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.180
that's that's again it's not necessarily
doesn't mean the lid so that that's how

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190
doesn't mean the lid so that that's how
 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.800
doesn't mean the lid so that that's how
that's how this explains here so we

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810
that's how this explains here so we
 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.909
that's how this explains here so we
explains we move to the right here it's

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919
explains we move to the right here it's
 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:46.680
explains we move to the right here it's
going to move letters in from the right

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690
going to move letters in from the right
 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.800
going to move letters in from the right
that's that's just one and then it's

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810
that's that's just one and then it's
 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.330
that's that's just one and then it's
going to lift stuff from the bottom so

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340
going to lift stuff from the bottom so
 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.440
going to lift stuff from the bottom so
yeah once you figured out and a lot of

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450
yeah once you figured out and a lot of
 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:53.850
yeah once you figured out and a lot of
it is is I actually didn't even know

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860
it is is I actually didn't even know
 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.730
it is is I actually didn't even know
that existed until level five or six and

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740
that existed until level five or six and
 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.159
that existed until level five or six and
so or at least really made full

00:05:59.159 --> 00:05:59.169
so or at least really made full
 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:01.440
so or at least really made full
attention of that so I think a lot of it

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450
attention of that so I think a lot of it
 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:02.129
attention of that so I think a lot of it
is

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:02.139
is
 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:04.379
is
I mean if your user like me who ignores

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:04.389
I mean if your user like me who ignores
 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:07.589
I mean if your user like me who ignores
YouTube videos on the google play market

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:07.599
YouTube videos on the google play market
 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:09.330
YouTube videos on the google play market
you may want to make that more clear

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.340
you may want to make that more clear
 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:10.950
you may want to make that more clear
when you start setting up the game and

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960
when you start setting up the game and
 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.809
when you start setting up the game and
introducing a game to your users ya na

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:12.819
introducing a game to your users ya na
 

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:14.790
introducing a game to your users ya na
de tutorial is nicely integrated into

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800
de tutorial is nicely integrated into
 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.080
de tutorial is nicely integrated into
the game the sense that the YouTube

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090
the game the sense that the YouTube
 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.909
the game the sense that the YouTube
video is a link from the name from the

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919
video is a link from the name from the
 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:23.040
video is a link from the name from the
main page of the game here and so the

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050
main page of the game here and so the
 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.170
main page of the game here and so the
good news at least if you're gotta look

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.180
good news at least if you're gotta look
 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.080
good news at least if you're gotta look
at the camera dude I'm offering any

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090
at the camera dude I'm offering any
 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.420
at the camera dude I'm offering any
place I have I unfortunately have to

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430
place I have I unfortunately have to
 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.589
place I have I unfortunately have to
either look at one or the other I can't

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:31.599
either look at one or the other I can't
 

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:34.490
either look at one or the other I can't
operate this game in in back this mode

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500
operate this game in in back this mode
 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.240
operate this game in in back this mode
I'm supposed to be so yeah the problem

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:39.250
I'm supposed to be so yeah the problem
 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.980
I'm supposed to be so yeah the problem
is also moving this is challenging all

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:40.990
is also moving this is challenging all
 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.339
is also moving this is challenging all
right so but anyways when you're

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:44.349
right so but anyways when you're
 

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:45.809
right so but anyways when you're
operating when you're actually operating

00:06:45.809 --> 00:06:45.819
operating when you're actually operating
 

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:48.659
operating when you're actually operating
the the game you can move you can go

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:48.669
the the game you can move you can go
 

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:51.809
the the game you can move you can go
back using the into the game by actually

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:51.819
back using the into the game by actually
 

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:54.529
back using the into the game by actually
hitting the home key in going back ooh

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:54.539
hitting the home key in going back ooh
 

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:57.059
hitting the home key in going back ooh
that's not fortunate I was going to try

00:06:57.059 --> 00:06:57.069
that's not fortunate I was going to try
 

00:06:57.069 --> 00:06:58.589
that's not fortunate I was going to try
to demonstrate something else um

00:06:58.589 --> 00:06:58.599
to demonstrate something else um
 

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:00.059

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:06.059
a lot of other subtle details I think
it'd be cleaned up to make the game just

00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:46.509
the developer actually went and proposed
 

00:07:46.509 --> 00:07:50.129
the developer actually went and proposed
a the fantastic open-source rendering

00:07:50.129 --> 00:07:50.139
a the fantastic open-source rendering
 

00:07:50.139 --> 00:07:53.159
a the fantastic open-source rendering

couple of problems we get into the
 

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.020
couple of problems we get into the
screen here one is that hitting the back

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:13.030
screen here one is that hitting the back
 

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.420
screen here one is that hitting the back
he actually accepts the games is the

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:15.430
he actually accepts the games is the
 

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:17.010
he actually accepts the games is the
game once again so that's that's

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:17.020
game once again so that's that's
 

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.260
game once again so that's that's
problematic I'm going to go back now

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:19.270
problematic I'm going to go back now
 

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:20.370
problematic I'm going to go back now
it's nice thing you see it's actually

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:20.380
it's nice thing you see it's actually
 

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.050
it's nice thing you see it's actually
remember the tile that I said that I use

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:22.060
remember the tile that I said that I use
 

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.460
remember the tile that I said that I use
but you notice that it didn't actually

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:23.470
but you notice that it didn't actually
 

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.830
but you notice that it didn't actually
remove these other ones again so here's

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:25.840
remove these other ones again so here's
 

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.360
remove these other ones again so here's
the problem if I go back to this screen

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:27.370
the problem if I go back to this screen
 

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:29.640
the problem if I go back to this screen
I can now select six by six tiles here

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:29.650
I can now select six by six tiles here
 

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:31.500
I can now select six by six tiles here
and if I actually hit play you end up

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:31.510
and if I actually hit play you end up
 

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.930
and if I actually hit play you end up
with that yeah so there were a lot of

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:33.940
with that yeah so there were a lot of
 

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:35.340
with that yeah so there were a lot of
just sort of bugs the other problem is

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:35.350
just sort of bugs the other problem is
 

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:37.650
just sort of bugs the other problem is
that is that this key here looks like

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:37.660
that is that this key here looks like
 

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:39.840
that is that this key here looks like
restart in action which is what be

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:39.850
restart in action which is what be
 

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:40.950
restart in action which is what be
really nicely does that but actually

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:40.960
really nicely does that but actually
 

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.300
really nicely does that but actually
what is it also takes you back to the

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:42.310
what is it also takes you back to the
 

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:45.480
what is it also takes you back to the
main menu another other problems this

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:45.490
main menu another other problems this
 

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:46.770
main menu another other problems this
game has when we go back to the main

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:46.780
game has when we go back to the main
 

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:49.170
game has when we go back to the main
menu here get to a non corrupt looking

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:49.180
menu here get to a non corrupt looking
 

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:54.630
menu here get to a non corrupt looking
screen is that this this particular view

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:54.640
screen is that this this particular view
 

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.730
screen is that this this particular view
here sort of feels like an intro to the

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:56.740
here sort of feels like an intro to the
 

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:00.000
here sort of feels like an intro to the
game right but in fact it is all in the

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:00.010
game right but in fact it is all in the
 

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:01.770
game right but in fact it is all in the
same activity and because of that hangs

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:01.780
same activity and because of that hangs
 

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.870
same activity and because of that hangs
back you know get out of both the other

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:03.880
back you know get out of both the other
 

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.890
back you know get out of both the other
things the game does though which is

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:04.900
things the game does though which is
 

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.870
things the game does though which is
pretty really pretty unusual is if you

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:06.880
pretty really pretty unusual is if you
 

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.960
pretty really pretty unusual is if you
actually hit and go back to you know the

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:09.970
actually hit and go back to you know the
 

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:12.270
actually hit and go back to you know the
home screen and then try to go back into

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:12.280
home screen and then try to go back into
 

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.800
home screen and then try to go back into
the game you'll see that the game

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:13.810
the game you'll see that the game
 

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:17.610
the game you'll see that the game
actually has now changed its state right

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:17.620
actually has now changed its state right
 

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:20.940
actually has now changed its state right
and so any like any any exit from the

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:20.950
and so any like any any exit from the
 

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:22.680
and so any like any any exit from the
game at all but however it's interrupted

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:22.690
game at all but however it's interrupted
 

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:24.030
game at all but however it's interrupted
read changes the state so this is

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:24.040
read changes the state so this is
 

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:24.810
read changes the state so this is
something you should know it's

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:24.820
something you should know it's
 

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.670
something you should know it's
definitely worth fixing so first of all

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:26.680
definitely worth fixing so first of all
 

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.530
definitely worth fixing so first of all
we have an on-screen indicator that sort

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:28.540
we have an on-screen indicator that sort
 

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.090
we have an on-screen indicator that sort
of does what a back you would do but

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:30.100
of does what a back you would do but
 

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.680
of does what a back you would do but
actually doesn't and then we have this

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:31.690
actually doesn't and then we have this
 

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:33.900
actually doesn't and then we have this
kind of immediate kill behavior I'm Brad

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:33.910
kind of immediate kill behavior I'm Brad
 

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:36.090
kind of immediate kill behavior I'm Brad
a key and one other thing at least for

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:36.100
a key and one other thing at least for
 

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.800
a key and one other thing at least for
me it's just it actually took me forever

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:37.810
me it's just it actually took me forever
 

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:40.470
me it's just it actually took me forever
to figure out how to actually move the

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:40.480
to figure out how to actually move the
 

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.720
to figure out how to actually move the
tiles because then you know in games

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:42.730
tiles because then you know in games
 

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:43.890
tiles because then you know in games
like this you're always used to like

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:43.900
like this you're always used to like
 

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:45.750
like this you're always used to like
guess your base stuff whereas like oh

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:45.760
guess your base stuff whereas like oh
 

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.430

direction of moves it's kind of weird

00:09:58.170 --> 00:09:58.180
direction of moves it's kind of weird
 

00:09:58.180 --> 00:09:59.820
direction of moves it's kind of weird
because it took me a while to figure

00:09:59.820 --> 00:09:59.830
because it took me a while to figure
 

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:03.090
because it took me a while to figure
that out but definitely like making

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:03.100
that out but definitely like making
 

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.620

guesstures are you I
 

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:11.680
guesstures are you I
that you put in make sure it matches

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:11.690
that you put in make sure it matches
 

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:13.960

to use the gesture detector that's built

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:16.880
to use the gesture detector that's built
 

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.060
to use the gesture detector that's built
into the android framework you can

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:19.070
into the android framework you can
 

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:22.360
into the android framework you can
actually detect that that that kind a

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:22.370
actually detect that that that kind a
 

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:24.070
actually detect that that that kind a
kind of that that kind of gesture which

kind of that that kind of gesture which
 

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.420
kind of that that kind of gesture which
was would be a paging gesture we

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:25.430
was would be a paging gesture we
 

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.120
was would be a paging gesture we
actually call it a guy the name of

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:28.130
actually call it a guy the name of
 

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:29.380
actually call it a guy the name of

not fooling anybody so um so yeah so

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:50.600
not fooling anybody so um so yeah so
 

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:51.940

definitely some gestures i also think

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:51.950
definitely some gestures i also think
 

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:53.170
definitely some gestures i also think
knowing where the solution is it's not

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:53.180
knowing where the solution is it's not
 

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:54.790
knowing where the solution is it's not
clear that the numbers actually should

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:54.800
clear that the numbers actually should
 

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.200
clear that the numbers actually should
be going across or they should be going

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:56.210
be going across or they should be going
 

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:58.930
be going across or they should be going
up and down and at whether one should be

00:11:58.930 --> 00:11:58.940
up and down and at whether one should be
 

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:00.460
up and down and at whether one should be
you know where one should be right i

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:00.470
you know where one should be right i
 

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:01.990
you know where one should be right i
think i think that would also be very

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.000
think i think that would also be very
 

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.340
think i think that would also be very
very useful to actually show the

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:03.350
very useful to actually show the
 

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:07.000
very useful to actually show the
solution but that's kind of that's kind

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:07.010
solution but that's kind of that's kind
 

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:08.970
solution but that's kind of that's kind
of a minor knit day i think most people

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:08.980
of a minor knit day i think most people
 

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.620
of a minor knit day i think most people

understand what a number puzzle is or at
least is that you know sometimes you do

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:15.200
least is that you know sometimes you do
 

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.560

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:18.970
want to solve 123456 and beyond both
solutions are actually acceptable i'm

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:18.980
solutions are actually acceptable i'm
 

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:21.130

she's solving this but yeah I'm not a

00:12:24.019 --> 00:12:24.029
she's solving this but yeah I'm not a

huge fan of the number puzzle and never

00:12:25.699 --> 00:12:25.709
huge fan of the number puzzle and never
 

00:12:25.709 --> 00:12:27.139

puzzled but a really great first effort

00:12:27.139 --> 00:12:27.149
puzzled but a really great first effort
 

00:12:27.149 --> 00:12:28.850

and on and you get a beautifully

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:28.860
and on and you get a beautifully
 

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.879
and on and you get a beautifully
rendered tiles and and again just some

00:12:31.879 --> 00:12:31.889
rendered tiles and and again just some
 

00:12:31.889 --> 00:12:33.079
rendered tiles and and again just some
things to think about the biggest one I

00:12:33.079 --> 00:12:33.089
things to think about the biggest one I
 

00:12:33.089 --> 00:12:35.059
things to think about the biggest one I
think really is is it is a state and

00:12:35.059 --> 00:12:35.069
think really is is it is a state and
 

00:12:35.069 --> 00:12:37.309
think really is is it is a state and
these controls here in order to disable

00:12:37.309 --> 00:12:37.319
these controls here in order to disable
 

00:12:37.319 --> 00:12:38.509
these controls here in order to disable
them when you're actually going back

00:12:38.509 --> 00:12:38.519
them when you're actually going back
 

00:12:38.519 --> 00:12:41.120
them when you're actually going back
here you need to actually go through and

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:41.130
here you need to actually go through and
 

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:42.980
here you need to actually go through and
run through that same disable logic

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:42.990
run through that same disable logic
 

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:44.059
run through that same disable logic
because you really don't want users to

00:12:44.059 --> 00:12:44.069
because you really don't want users to
 

00:12:44.069 --> 00:12:46.519
because you really don't want users to
get to this screen action yeah and also

00:12:46.519 --> 00:12:46.529
get to this screen action yeah and also
 

00:12:46.529 --> 00:12:48.259

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:51.970
you're on a tablet layout and you know
again there's just a lot more that can

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:51.980
again there's just a lot more that can
 

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:55.420
again there's just a lot more that can
be done here people need to see but it

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:55.430
be done here people need to see but it
 

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:59.380
be done here people need to see but it
there you go no its total ride right

00:16:59.380 --> 00:16:59.390
there you go no its total ride right
 

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:01.150
there you go no its total ride right

anyways I don't know much more we've

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:08.870
anyways I don't know much more we've
 

00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:10.020
anyways I don't know much more we've
really much more to say about this

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:10.030
really much more to say about this
 

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:12.550
really much more to say about this
because it is a real-time game this is

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:12.560
because it is a real-time game this is
 

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.380
because it is a real-time game this is
actually one of those really really is

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:14.390
actually one of those really really is
 

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:16.690
actually one of those really really is
actually a good good game for actually

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:16.700
actually a good good game for actually
 

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:19.510
actually a good good game for actually
putting up a dialogue very very rare

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520
putting up a dialogue very very rare
 

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.040
putting up a dialogue very very rare
that I would actually suggest putting up

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:21.050
that I would actually suggest putting up
 

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:23.200
that I would actually suggest putting up
a dialogue right this but this is real

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:23.210
a dialogue right this but this is real
 

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:25.270
a dialogue right this but this is real
time so closing so actually exiting the

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:25.280
time so closing so actually exiting the
 

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.550
time so closing so actually exiting the
game just kind of ruin your ability to

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:27.560
game just kind of ruin your ability to
 

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.830
game just kind of ruin your ability to
play that particular round so it makes

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:29.840
play that particular round so it makes
 

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.540
play that particular round so it makes
sense and it does take you back here to

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:31.550
sense and it does take you back here to
 

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:32.920
sense and it does take you back here to
the level screen and then that takes you

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:32.930
the level screen and then that takes you
 

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:34.600
the level screen and then that takes you
out so that's all that's all good

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:34.610
out so that's all that's all good
 

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:37.210
out so that's all that's all good
navigation wouldn't we the rest the

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:37.220
navigation wouldn't we the rest the
 

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.230
navigation wouldn't we the rest the
games will actually work on the

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:38.240
games will actually work on the
 

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.610
games will actually work on the
transformer prime yes I did promise

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:39.620
transformer prime yes I did promise
 

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:42.250
transformer prime yes I did promise
sorry yeah but after that particular

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:42.260
sorry yeah but after that particular
 

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:43.780
sorry yeah but after that particular
game we did actually have to go through

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:43.790
game we did actually have to go through
 

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:45.730
game we did actually have to go through
some additional effort to get to work

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:45.740
some additional effort to get to work
 

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:48.070
some additional effort to get to work
and again you know being able to test on

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080
and again you know being able to test on
 

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.930
and again you know being able to test on
one on one tablet is always a good thing

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:49.940
one on one tablet is always a good thing
 

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:51.610
one on one tablet is always a good thing
it's kind of unusual because it looks

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:51.620
it's kind of unusual because it looks
 

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:53.170
it's kind of unusual because it looks
like that game is using the framework so

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:53.180
like that game is using the framework so
 

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:55.180
like that game is using the framework so
it's kind of a strange thing to start

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:55.190
it's kind of a strange thing to start
 

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:58.270
it's kind of a strange thing to start
game that's having trouble that is a

00:17:58.270 --> 00:17:58.280
game that's having trouble that is a
 

00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.160
game that's having trouble that is a
good framework

00:17:59.160 --> 00:17:59.170
good framework
 

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:01.840
good framework
alright we are going we're going in in

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:01.850
alright we are going we're going in in
 

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:03.820
alright we are going we're going in in
in in order here so the next game is

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:03.830
in in order here so the next game is
 

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:06.970
in in order here so the next game is
stackable okay so such camps is somewhat

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:06.980
stackable okay so such camps is somewhat
 

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.750
stackable okay so such camps is somewhat
this one actually works so exactly we

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:09.760
this one actually works so exactly we
 

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:13.680
this one actually works so exactly we
switch keys and we're now in a game and

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:13.690
switch keys and we're now in a game and
 

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:17.950
switch keys and we're now in a game and
that ball goal is to make the ball sack

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:17.960
that ball goal is to make the ball sack
 

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:22.180
that ball goal is to make the ball sack
to match the shadows easy right at the

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:22.190
to match the shadows easy right at the
 

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:23.620
to match the shadows easy right at the
bottom of the level it's kind of like

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:23.630
bottom of the level it's kind of like
 

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:26.080
bottom of the level it's kind of like
reverse Tetris so that the object is is

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:26.090
reverse Tetris so that the object is is
 

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:27.850
reverse Tetris so that the object is is
to stack the balls as many as you can

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:27.860
to stack the balls as many as you can
 

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:30.190
to stack the balls as many as you can
without actually having three balls

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:30.200
without actually having three balls
 

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.290
without actually having three balls
connecting at any time and so you're

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:32.300
connecting at any time and so you're
 

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.150
connecting at any time and so you're
supposed to keep stacking until you run

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:34.160
supposed to keep stacking until you run
 

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.860
supposed to keep stacking until you run
out of balls this is going to be really

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:35.870
out of balls this is going to be really
 

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:38.260
out of balls this is going to be really
unfun on my tablet cuz it does make it

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:38.270
unfun on my tablet cuz it does make it
 

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:40.600
unfun on my tablet cuz it does make it
take advantage of accelerant right so

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:40.610
take advantage of accelerant right so
 

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:42.640
take advantage of accelerant right so
usually when I rotate this thing will

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:42.650
usually when I rotate this thing will
 

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:46.380
usually when I rotate this thing will
lose HDMI will turn really careful here

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:46.390
lose HDMI will turn really careful here
 

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:48.940
lose HDMI will turn really careful here
Ian likes to point out how dorky this

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:48.950
Ian likes to point out how dorky this
 

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:50.200
Ian likes to point out how dorky this
looks when I'm actually using the

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:50.210
looks when I'm actually using the
 

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:52.180
looks when I'm actually using the
keyboard with an accelerometer gained it

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:52.190
keyboard with an accelerometer gained it
 

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:55.870
keyboard with an accelerometer gained it
really does but on the other hand yeah I

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:55.880
really does but on the other hand yeah I
 

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:59.980
really does but on the other hand yeah I
tend to to not lose HDMI quite often you

00:18:59.980 --> 00:18:59.990
tend to to not lose HDMI quite often you
 

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:02.710
tend to to not lose HDMI quite often you
do have to push the tap the screen to

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720
do have to push the tap the screen to
 

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.840
do have to push the tap the screen to
release the balls and so part of the

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:04.850
release the balls and so part of the
 

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:06.250
release the balls and so part of the
challenge is actually an arcade live

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:06.260
challenge is actually an arcade live
 

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.650
challenge is actually an arcade live
challenge and part of it and it's kind

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:08.660
challenge and part of it and it's kind
 

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:10.540
challenge and part of it and it's kind
of unfortunately random also so you see

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:10.550
of unfortunately random also so you see
 

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:12.460
of unfortunately random also so you see
if I those three balls touch they get

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:12.470
if I those three balls touch they get
 

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:14.950
if I those three balls touch they get
destroyed right since the balls come in

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:14.960
destroyed right since the balls come in
 

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.810
destroyed right since the balls come in
apparently random colors the challenge

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:16.820
apparently random colors the challenge
 

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:18.550
apparently random colors the challenge
is also somewhat random which is a

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:18.560
is also somewhat random which is a
 

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.650
is also somewhat random which is a
little unfortunate well the one the one

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:20.660
little unfortunate well the one the one
 

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.030
little unfortunate well the one the one
big thing I actually have probably is I

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:22.040
big thing I actually have probably is I
 

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.210
big thing I actually have probably is I
never know when I'm actually done and so

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:24.220
never know when I'm actually done and so
 

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.380
never know when I'm actually done and so
because it says just keep going until

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:26.390
because it says just keep going until
 

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:27.760
because it says just keep going until
there's no more balls but it'd be nice

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:27.770
there's no more balls but it'd be nice
 

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:29.560
there's no more balls but it'd be nice
for the ball counter to be the reverse

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:29.570
for the ball counter to be the reverse
 

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:32.160
for the ball counter to be the reverse
count not how many balls I have going

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:32.170
count not how many balls I have going
 

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:35.170
count not how many balls I have going
down the thing and it's also pretty slow

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:35.180
down the thing and it's also pretty slow
 

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:36.790
down the thing and it's also pretty slow
too I mean for an arcade game that's

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:36.800
too I mean for an arcade game that's
 

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.230
too I mean for an arcade game that's
kind of like all about falling I mean

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:38.240
kind of like all about falling I mean
 

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.940
kind of like all about falling I mean
the cool thing about Tetris was is that

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:39.950
the cool thing about Tetris was is that
 

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:42.190
the cool thing about Tetris was is that
I mean or any game thy building block

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:42.200
I mean or any game thy building block
 

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.320
I mean or any game thy building block
game is that it actually it speeds up

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:44.330
game is that it actually it speeds up
 

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:45.790
game is that it actually it speeds up
right and here you really can't control

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:45.800
right and here you really can't control
 

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.400
right and here you really can't control
the speed of the ball which is a little

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:48.410
the speed of the ball which is a little
 

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:50.020
the speed of the ball which is a little
strange right the other thing yeah I

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:50.030
strange right the other thing yeah I
 

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:52.090
strange right the other thing yeah I
really do want to be able to swipe down

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:52.100
really do want to be able to swipe down
 

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.400
really do want to be able to swipe down
the balls and Bray done but all the

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:54.410
the balls and Bray done but all the
 

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:55.600
the balls and Bray done but all the
thing is you just end up getting a whole

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:55.610
thing is you just end up getting a whole
 

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:57.910
thing is you just end up getting a whole
bunch of blue balls like these in a row

00:19:57.910 --> 00:19:57.920
bunch of blue balls like these in a row
 

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.520
bunch of blue balls like these in a row
this distribution you do end up with

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:00.530
this distribution you do end up with
 

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:01.870
this distribution you do end up with
this with this kind of unfortunate

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:01.880
this with this kind of unfortunate
 

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.850
this with this kind of unfortunate
situation of the balls that's all the

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:03.860
situation of the balls that's all the
 

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:05.350
situation of the balls that's all the
story each other alright so I'm not

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:05.360
story each other alright so I'm not
 

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:06.940
story each other alright so I'm not
really sure what to do about that now

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:06.950
really sure what to do about that now
 

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:08.680
really sure what to do about that now
the game is yet again the goal is to

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:08.690
the game is yet again the goal is to
 

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:11.170
the game is yet again the goal is to
stack up the ball so they do match this

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:11.180
stack up the ball so they do match this
 

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:15.040
stack up the ball so they do match this
the kind of a shadow pattern and that's

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:15.050
the kind of a shadow pattern and that's
 

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:16.270
the kind of a shadow pattern and that's
going to be really hard for me because

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:16.280
going to be really hard for me because
 

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.640
going to be really hard for me because
I'm gonna actually have to destroy some

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:18.650
I'm gonna actually have to destroy some
 

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:20.890
I'm gonna actually have to destroy some
blue balls here yeah cuz he's kind of

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:20.900
blue balls here yeah cuz he's kind of
 

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:22.390
blue balls here yeah cuz he's kind of
run out no but you can keep stacking on

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400
run out no but you can keep stacking on
 

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.500
run out no but you can keep stacking on
the left you can just create a third one

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:23.510
the left you can just create a third one
 

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:25.900
the left you can just create a third one
but the goal is to actually make them

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:25.910
but the goal is to actually make them
 

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:28.930
but the goal is to actually make them
match so that's that's that's the

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:28.940
match so that's that's that's the
 

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:34.960
match so that's that's that's the
challenge here it so what second I

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:34.970
challenge here it so what second I
 

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:37.240
challenge here it so what second I
totally don't understand the goal is to

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:37.250
totally don't understand the goal is to
 

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:38.800
totally don't understand the goal is to
make them match but you also need to get

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:38.810
make them match but you also need to get
 

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:40.000
make them match but you also need to get
them higher yeah I don't think so i

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:40.010
them higher yeah I don't think so i
 

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:41.680
them higher yeah I don't think so i
think i think we don't want them the

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:41.690
think i think we don't want them the
 

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:43.810
think i think we don't want them the
matter was to not make them it's not

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:43.820
matter was to not make them it's not
 

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:45.400
matter was to not make them it's not
made magic to make the balls match the

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:45.410
made magic to make the balls match the
 

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:47.080
made magic to make the balls match the
shadows right but then you're not

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:47.090
shadows right but then you're not
 

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:48.730
shadows right but then you're not
supposed but if you match three of the

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:48.740
supposed but if you match three of the
 

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:50.290
supposed but if you match three of the
same balls and they're gonna destroy

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:50.300
same balls and they're gonna destroy
 

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.150
same balls and they're gonna destroy
everything right right so that's the key

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:52.160
everything right right so that's the key
 

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:53.290
everything right right so that's the key
thing is we want to make the balls match

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:53.300
thing is we want to make the balls match
 

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:54.460
thing is we want to make the balls match
the shadow but we also don't want to go

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:54.470
the shadow but we also don't want to go
 

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:56.740
the shadow but we also don't want to go
above the shadow because if we if we fit

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:56.750
above the shadow because if we if we fit
 

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:58.120
above the shadow because if we if we fit
everything into the shitty then we have

00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:58.130
everything into the shitty then we have
 

00:20:58.130 --> 00:20:59.890
everything into the shitty then we have
to fit all the balls into the shadow oh

00:20:59.890 --> 00:20:59.900
to fit all the balls into the shadow oh
 

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:02.740
to fit all the balls into the shadow oh
ok that's oh so what you're saying is is

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:02.750
ok that's oh so what you're saying is is
 

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:04.720
ok that's oh so what you're saying is is
if you were to stack it so you've got

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:04.730
if you were to stack it so you've got
 

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:07.510
if you were to stack it so you've got
two rows right now if you were to stack

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:07.520
two rows right now if you were to stack
 

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:11.020
two rows right now if you were to stack
it 3i that's no good yes ok and you just

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:11.030
it 3i that's no good yes ok and you just
 

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:13.300
it 3i that's no good yes ok and you just
get exactly that tags exactly match the

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:13.310
get exactly that tags exactly match the
 

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:15.730
get exactly that tags exactly match the
puzzle there right and because the ball

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:15.740
puzzle there right and because the ball
 

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:17.650
puzzle there right and because the ball
the roll the ball distribution seems to

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:17.660
the roll the ball distribution seems to
 

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:20.080
the roll the ball distribution seems to
be pretty random it can be kind of a

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:20.090
be pretty random it can be kind of a
 

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:21.310
be pretty random it can be kind of a
random difficulty I think one of the

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:21.320
random difficulty I think one of the
 

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:23.050
random difficulty I think one of the
challenges with building a game life

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:23.060
challenges with building a game life
 

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:24.430
challenges with building a game life
threat is getting it difficult to

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:24.440
threat is getting it difficult to
 

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.170
threat is getting it difficult to
consistent in two teams that I think

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:26.180
consistent in two teams that I think
 

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:28.630
consistent in two teams that I think
that struggle with with randomness are

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:28.640
that struggle with with randomness are
 

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:31.360
that struggle with with randomness are
this game inward push both right both of

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:31.370
this game inward push both right both of
 

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:33.610
this game inward push both right both of
them really get you very different

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:33.620
them really get you very different
 

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:35.770
them really get you very different
levels of challenge depending on the

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:35.780
levels of challenge depending on the
 

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:37.630
levels of challenge depending on the
level depending where random numbers you

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:37.640
level depending where random numbers you
 

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.270
level depending where random numbers you
get so this game actually does have

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:40.280
get so this game actually does have
 

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.310
get so this game actually does have
physics though which is kind of yeah so

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:42.320
physics though which is kind of yeah so
 

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:43.570
physics though which is kind of yeah so
you'll see that if there's actually real

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:43.580
you'll see that if there's actually real
 

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:45.760
you'll see that if there's actually real
physics going on when the balls fall

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:45.770
physics going on when the balls fall
 

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:47.830
physics going on when the balls fall
which sometimes example in sometimes

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840
which sometimes example in sometimes
 

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.990
which sometimes example in sometimes
yeah I think they use box2d so probably

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.000
yeah I think they use box2d so probably
 

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:50.860
yeah I think they use box2d so probably
yeah I

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:50.870
yeah I

yeah I
they say that idea they said on the

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:52.370
they say that idea they said on the
 

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:54.580
they say that idea they said on the
about notes if you look carefully hit up

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:54.590
about notes if you look carefully hit up
 

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:56.530
about notes if you look carefully hit up
so did complete the beginner level there

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:56.540
so did complete the beginner level there
 

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:58.510
so did complete the beginner level there
as you see which is cool but also yeah

00:21:58.510 --> 00:21:58.520
as you see which is cool but also yeah
 

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:00.820
as you see which is cool but also yeah
takes a while so yeah we've now wait

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:00.830
takes a while so yeah we've now wait
 

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:02.320
takes a while so yeah we've now wait
spent buddy I know some things to note

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:02.330
spent buddy I know some things to note

about this this game sort of uses

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:04.360
about this this game sort of uses
 

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:08.020
about this this game sort of uses
android things so if you click in the

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:08.030
android things so if you click in the
 

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:09.549
android things so if you click in the
back key one sweet offense again we just

00:22:09.549 --> 00:22:09.559
back key one sweet offense again we just
 

00:22:09.559 --> 00:22:11.650
back key one sweet offense again we just
egg to the game immediately but they're

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:11.660
egg to the game immediately but they're
 

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.450
egg to the game immediately but they're
so and you this game is just again not

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:13.460
so and you this game is just again not
 

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:15.250
so and you this game is just again not
not modifying the standard activity

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:15.260
not modifying the standard activity
 

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:16.660
not modifying the standard activity
behavior and it does a lot of things in

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:16.670
behavior and it does a lot of things in
 

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:18.580
behavior and it does a lot of things in
the same activities a select level is

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:18.590
the same activities a select level is
 

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:20.620
the same activities a select level is
also done yet kitty hitting the back key

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:20.630
also done yet kitty hitting the back key
 

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:23.350

so you see that's another equity how

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:34.790
so you see that's another equity how
 

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:36.250
so you see that's another equity how
hitting the back he does the right thing

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:36.260
hitting the back he does the right thing
 

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:38.260

takes you back here to where we were so
this is another another game that's

00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:39.500
this is another another game that's
 

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:43.060
this is another another game that's
navigationally challenged and so just

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:43.070
navigationally challenged and so just
 

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:44.350
navigationally challenged and so just
think you know again it just doesn't

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:44.360
think you know again it just doesn't
 

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:45.850
think you know again it just doesn't
make sense if i hit select level it

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:45.860
make sense if i hit select level it
 

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:47.799
make sense if i hit select level it

like what do i do if i don't want to

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:55.520
like what do i do if i don't want to
 

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.590
like what do i do if i don't want to
select any what you select the same

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:56.600

thing so again i think from it from an

00:22:58.900 --> 00:22:58.910
thing so again i think from it from an
 

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:00.100
thing so again i think from it from an
android perspective it doesn't make

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:00.110
android perspective it doesn't make
 

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:02.049
android perspective it doesn't make
sense putting it okay at the bottom here

00:23:02.049 --> 00:23:02.059
sense putting it okay at the bottom here
 

00:23:02.059 --> 00:23:04.390
sense putting it okay at the bottom here
the high scores is no necessary it's not

it's not needed when we just really do

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:09.860
it's not needed when we just really do

it's not needed when we just really do

out of the damage point so that's all I

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:13.010
out of the damage point so that's all I
 

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:15.040

with what's fun about this games it is a

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:52.660
with what's fun about this games it is a
 

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:55.500
with what's fun about this games it is a
2d game but it's using it as far as the

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:55.510
2d game but it's using it as far as the
 

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:57.330
2d game but it's using it as far as the
user's input and control it is but it is

00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:57.340
user's input and control it is but it is
 

00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:00.240
user's input and control it is but it is
it isn't done in 3d space with 3d birds

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:00.250
it isn't done in 3d space with 3d birds
 

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:02.490
it isn't done in 3d space with 3d birds
and some really nice looking graphics

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:02.500
and some really nice looking graphics
 

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.080
and some really nice looking graphics
and they actually get a little bit of

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:04.090
and they actually get a little bit of
 

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:06.870
and they actually get a little bit of
benefit from that to the the backgrounds

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:06.880
benefit from that to the the backgrounds
 

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.550
benefit from that to the the backgrounds
look are fuzzy ate a little blurry

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:08.560
look are fuzzy ate a little blurry
 

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:09.330
look are fuzzy ate a little blurry
because they're a little lower

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:09.340
because they're a little lower
 

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:13.860
because they're a little lower
resolution than this device but the the

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:13.870
resolution than this device but the the
 

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:16.110
resolution than this device but the the
actual game looks very very high

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:16.120
actual game looks very very high
 

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.880

so do you think it's actually that

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:20.630
so do you think it's actually that
 

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:23.830
so do you think it's actually that
they're blurry because of the device or

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:23.840
they're blurry because of the device or
 

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.659
they're blurry because of the device or
do you think it's an intentional depth

00:25:25.659 --> 00:25:25.669
do you think it's an intentional depth
 

00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:26.890
do you think it's an intentional depth
of field effect I don't think it's

00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:26.900
of field effect I don't think it's
 

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:28.270
of field effect I don't think it's
intentional but I think it works very

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:28.280
intentional but I think it works very
 

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.669
intentional but I think it works very
well for their that's that was my

00:25:30.669 --> 00:25:30.679
well for their that's that was my
 

00:25:30.679 --> 00:25:32.380
well for their that's that was my
feeling maybe I could be wrong there but

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:32.390
feeling maybe I could be wrong there but
 

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:35.710
feeling maybe I could be wrong there but
it felt it felt like like a graphic so

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:35.720
it felt it felt like like a graphic so
 

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.000
it felt it felt like like a graphic so
in this case we can there's actually a

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:37.010
in this case we can there's actually a
 

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:40.180
in this case we can there's actually a
shorter path upon when we and so hipster

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:40.190
shorter path upon when we and so hipster
 

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:42.700
shorter path upon when we and so hipster
editing things about this it looks like

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:42.710
editing things about this it looks like
 

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:44.919
editing things about this it looks like
we I can't get the shorter path this

00:25:44.919 --> 00:25:44.929
we I can't get the shorter path this
 

00:25:44.929 --> 00:25:46.690
we I can't get the shorter path this
right so there's you have to wait oh I

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:46.700
right so there's you have to wait oh I
 

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:48.250
right so there's you have to wait oh I
know as we have to wait till they wait

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:48.260
know as we have to wait till they wait
 

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.260
know as we have to wait till they wait
until until they get into the right

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:50.270
until until they get into the right
 

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:55.830
until until they get into the right
place right actually there's actually

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:55.840
 
 

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.240
 
her dad right leaves the shortest path

00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:58.250
her dad right leaves the shortest path
 

00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:01.360
her dad right leaves the shortest path
um so again the game is the game is

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:01.370

at the beginning which is a little bit

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:39.750
at the beginning which is a little bit
 

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:41.900
at the beginning which is a little bit
unfortunate because you don't even

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:41.910
unfortunate because you don't even
 

00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:43.250

realize that sound is playing at the
beginning of the music because it's very

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:44.370
beginning of the music because it's very
 

00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:46.550
beginning of the music because it's very
very good which is very which is nice

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:48.180
and I can see how that would be useful
 

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:51.410
and I can see how that would be useful
but it's also something but that was a

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:51.420
but it's also something but that was a
 

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:52.820
but it's also something but that was a
little bit jarring when I was actually

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:52.830
little bit jarring when I was actually
 

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:55.070
little bit jarring when I was actually
in the middle of playing it but you know

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:55.080
in the middle of playing it but you know
 

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:56.450
in the middle of playing it but you know
that's a really minor issue I mean

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:56.460
that's a really minor issue I mean
 

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:58.490
that's a really minor issue I mean
honestly that I did not find anything

00:33:58.490 --> 00:33:58.500

maybe future down yeah maybe ready to be
feature now but I think what's really

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:06.090
feature now but I think what's really
 

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:08.030

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:13.400
uses of time to I mean a lot of its I
mean it's definitely very well thought

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:13.410

guide done it in 3d and you get the idea

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:10.940
guide done it in 3d and you get the idea
 

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:12.760
guide done it in 3d and you get the idea
of how these kinds of games to work all

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:12.770
of how these kinds of games to work all
 

00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:13.810
