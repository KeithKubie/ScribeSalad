00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.020
Based on the young adult book trilogy about
a dystopian America

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:17.790
divided into competitive sections, this doe-eyed
teenage heroine must lead a revolt against

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.010
a ruthless dictator who--

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.950
Wait, guys, we did this one already.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.150
It's The Hunger Games.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.770
"No, John, it's not The Hunger Games."

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.500
It's not? Are you sure? Because it looks and sounds
exactly like the Hunger Games.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.520
"Yeah, there's no fight to the death in this
one."

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.390
So, it's the same movie but without the actual
games? That sounds horrible.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.190
Divergent.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.979
Enter a world inspired by a woman who read
The Hunger Games and said to herself: "I can

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:46.940
change that slightly and make a ton of money!"

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.110
Journey to an overly-complicated future where
every teenager's career is determined by a

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.780
test that places them into one of five factions,
each based on a single personality trait --

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.140
unless they test positive for more than one,
which makes them a Divergent, but it's different

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.760
from being factionless which basically means
you're homeless.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.640
But the test doesn't matter because they can
choose whatever faction they want, which leads

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.000
to another series of tests.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.720
"There are two stages of training. You'll
be trained separately from the Dauntless born,

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.190
but you'll be ranked together. After initiations
rankings will determine what jobs you move

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.460
into."

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.430
"The rankings will also determine who gets
cut. At the end of each training the lowest

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.760
ranking --"

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.260
Ugh. The bowl of names in the Sorting Hat
were a lot more straight-forward.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.920
Gryffindor!

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.000
Volunteer as tribute to one of five factions
each named after a different SAT word.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.330
There's Abnegation,

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.750
The District 12s,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:36.530
Erudite,

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.430
The Slytherins,

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.520
Amity,

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.490
The Hufflepuffs,

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.720
The... Other One,

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.960
and Dauntless, the cool faction that plays
games,

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.050
gets tattoos,

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.380
and does parkour that every teen would choose
to join.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.340
Because no teenager in the right mind with
ever choose to be a f***ing farmer.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.780
Meet Tris, a secretly Divergent Abnegate turned
Dauntless who's just as insufferable as this

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:59.330
sentence.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.100
She's a heroine you're not embarrassed
to like, who's smarter than Bella and more

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.400
decisive than Katniss.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.890
But that won't stop her from getting her
ass kicked.

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.920
A lot.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.939
Witness a creepy romance bloom between Tris
and her much, much older trainer with an equally

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:20.819
dumb name.

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.230
"My name's Four."

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.109
"Four like the number?"

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:28.590
And thrill as these rebellious Divergents
uncover an evil conspiracy to eradicate an

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.379
entire district --

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:32.219
I mean, faction.

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:37.170
Watch things heat up as Shailene Woodley and
this super hot tattooed hunk make out,

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.230
while fighting against Miles Teller

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.959
who she made out in The Spectacular Now,

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.909
and being related to Ansel Elgort

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:47.280
who he made out with in The Fault In Our Stars.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.760
Eeeesh.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.659
It's like a quarter quell of guys Shailene's
porked.

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.980
Sit back for a film full of things that are
obvious attempts to pander to teenage girls

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:55.749
like

00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:57.969
staring at yourself in the mirror,

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:01.109
having perfect hair no matter how much you work
out,

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.329
hot older boys who see how special you are
on the inside,

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.889
"I know exactly who you are."

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:10.779
and telling them that choosing your clique
is the most important decision you ever make.

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:13.090
"Faction before blood."

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.409
So get ready to be left hanging, while our
two love interests outsmart the evil government,

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:23.120
then ride off on a train into a uncertain
future.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.480
Guys, I'm telling you. We did this already.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.780
Starring

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.720
Kattris,

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.239
I am Number Four,

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.129
The Fault in our Co-Stars,

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:32.790
Kilometers Teller,

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:33.689
Old Rose,

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:36.150
Mekhi Phive Minutes of Screen Time,

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.700
Kat Von D,

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.340
and Cinna's Daughter.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.469
Not the Hunger Games.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.000
Yikes, one kid with hepatitis and they're
all going down!
