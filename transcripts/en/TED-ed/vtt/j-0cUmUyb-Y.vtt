00:00:31.085 --> 00:00:33.847
Big data is an elusive concept.

00:00:35.987 --> 00:00:38.675
It represents an amount of digital information,

00:00:38.675 --> 00:00:40.845
which is uncomfortable to store,

00:00:40.845 --> 00:00:41.973
transport,

00:00:41.973 --> 00:00:43.851
or analyze.

00:00:43.851 --> 00:00:45.766
Big data is so voluminous

00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:48.474
that it overwhelms the technologies of the day

00:00:48.474 --> 00:00:50.899
and challenges us to create the next generation

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.004
of data storage tools and techniques.

00:00:59.557 --> 00:01:01.336
So, big data isn't new.

00:01:01.336 --> 00:01:03.694
In fact, physicists at CERN have been rangling

00:01:03.694 --> 00:01:08.093
with the challenge of their ever-expanding big data for decades.

00:01:09.431 --> 00:01:11.754
Fifty years ago, CERN's data could be stored

00:01:11.754 --> 00:01:13.506
in a single computer.

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:15.660
OK, so it wasn't your usual computer,

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.077
this was a mainframe computer

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:19.387
that filled an entire building.

00:01:21.494 --> 00:01:22.663
To analyze the data,

00:01:22.663 --> 00:01:25.611
physicists from around the world traveled to CERN

00:01:25.611 --> 00:01:28.637
to connect to the enormous machine.

00:01:31.075 --> 00:01:33.928
In the 1970's, our ever-growing big data

00:01:33.928 --> 00:01:36.678
was distributed across different sets of computers,

00:01:36.678 --> 00:01:38.708
which mushroomed at CERN.

00:01:38.708 --> 00:01:40.150
Each set was joined together

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.678
in dedicated, homegrown networks.

00:01:42.678 --> 00:01:44.464
But physicists collaborated without regard

00:01:44.464 --> 00:01:46.413
for the boundaries between sets,

00:01:46.413 --> 00:01:49.302
hence needed to access data on all of these.

00:01:49.302 --> 00:01:51.287
So, we bridged the independent networks together

00:01:51.287 --> 00:01:54.379
in our own CERNET.

00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:57.227
In the 1980's, islands of similar networks

00:01:57.227 --> 00:01:58.771
speaking different dialects

00:01:58.771 --> 00:02:01.311
sprung up all over Europe and the States,

00:02:01.311 --> 00:02:04.402
making remote access possible but torturous.

00:02:04.402 --> 00:02:06.546
To make it easy for our physicists across the world

00:02:06.546 --> 00:02:08.951
to access the ever-expanding big data

00:02:08.951 --> 00:02:10.744
stored at CERN without traveling,

00:02:10.744 --> 00:02:12.043
the networks needed to be talking

00:02:12.043 --> 00:02:13.413
with the same language.

00:02:13.413 --> 00:02:17.208
We adopted the fledgling internet working standard from the States,

00:02:17.208 --> 00:02:18.584
followed by the rest of Europe,

00:02:18.584 --> 00:02:20.752
and we established the principal link at CERN

00:02:20.752 --> 00:02:23.255
between Europe and the States in 1989,

00:02:23.255 --> 00:02:26.041
and the truly global internet took off!

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.371
Physicists could easily then access

00:02:30.371 --> 00:02:32.183
the terabytes of big data

00:02:32.183 --> 00:02:33.846
remotely from around the world,

00:02:33.846 --> 00:02:35.225
generate results,

00:02:35.225 --> 00:02:37.520
and write papers in their home institutes.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.021
Then, they wanted to share their findings

00:02:39.021 --> 00:02:40.813
with all their colleagues.

00:02:40.813 --> 00:02:42.416
To make this information sharing easy,

00:02:42.416 --> 00:02:45.358
we created the web in the early 1990's.

00:02:45.358 --> 00:02:47.196
Physicists no longer needed to know

00:02:47.196 --> 00:02:48.833
where the information was stored

00:02:48.833 --> 00:02:51.402
in order to find it and access it on the web,

00:02:51.402 --> 00:02:53.536
an idea which caught on across the world

00:02:53.536 --> 00:02:55.912
and has transformed the way we communicate

00:02:55.912 --> 00:02:57.580
in our daily lives.

00:03:00.226 --> 00:03:01.633
During the early 2000's,

00:03:01.633 --> 00:03:03.623
the continued growth of our big data

00:03:03.623 --> 00:03:06.914
outstripped our capability to analyze it at CERN,

00:03:06.914 --> 00:03:10.499
despite having buildings full of computers.

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:12.805
We had to start distributing the petabytes of data

00:03:12.805 --> 00:03:14.387
to our collaborating partners

00:03:14.387 --> 00:03:17.139
in order to employ local computing and storage

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:19.974
at hundreds of different institutes.

00:03:19.974 --> 00:03:22.269
In order to orchestrate these interconnected resources

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.313
with their diverse technologies,

00:03:24.313 --> 00:03:26.064
we developed a computing grid,

00:03:26.064 --> 00:03:27.640
enabling the seamless sharing

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.068
of computing resources around the globe.

00:03:30.068 --> 00:03:34.459
This relies on trust relationships and mutual exchange.

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.752
But this grid model could not be transferred

00:03:36.752 --> 00:03:39.036
out of our community so easily,

00:03:39.036 --> 00:03:41.330
where not everyone has resources to share

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.206
nor could companies be expected

00:03:43.206 --> 00:03:45.959
to have the same level of trust.

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.254
Instead, an alternative, more business-like approach

00:03:48.254 --> 00:03:50.090
for accessing on-demand resources

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.798
has been flourishing recently,

00:03:51.798 --> 00:03:53.466
called cloud computing,

00:03:53.466 --> 00:03:55.342
which other communities are now exploiting

00:03:55.342 --> 00:03:57.342
to analyzing their big data.

00:03:57.342 --> 00:04:00.329
It might seem paradoxical for a place like CERN,

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:01.900
a lab focused on the study

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.071
of the unimaginably small building blocks of matter,

00:04:05.071 --> 00:04:08.448
to be the source of something as big as big data.

00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:10.530
But the way we study the fundamental particles,

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.143
as well as the forces by which they interact,

00:04:13.143 --> 00:04:15.246
involves creating them fleetingly,

00:04:15.246 --> 00:04:17.614
colliding protons in our accelerators

00:04:17.614 --> 00:04:19.041
and capturing a trace of them

00:04:19.041 --> 00:04:21.314
as they zoom off near light speed.

00:04:21.314 --> 00:04:22.308
To see those traces,

00:04:22.308 --> 00:04:25.756
our detector, with 150 million sensors,

00:04:25.756 --> 00:04:28.231
acts like a really massive 3-D camera,

00:04:28.231 --> 00:04:30.341
taking a picture of each collision event -

00:04:30.341 --> 00:04:32.891
that's up to 14 millions times per second.

00:04:32.891 --> 00:04:35.424
That makes a lot of data.

00:04:37.194 --> 00:04:39.353
But if big data has been around for so long,

00:04:39.353 --> 00:04:41.980
why do we suddenly keep hearing about it now?

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.691
Well, as the old metaphor explains,

00:04:43.691 --> 00:04:46.479
the whole is greater than the sum of its parts,

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.256
and this is no longer just science that is exploiting this.

00:04:50.256 --> 00:04:51.860
The fact that we can derive more knowledge

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.190
by joining related information together

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.741
and spotting correlations

00:04:55.741 --> 00:04:59.132
can inform and enrich numerous aspects of everyday life,

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:00.160
either in real time,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.451
such as traffic or financial conditions,

00:05:02.451 --> 00:05:04.206
in short-term evolutions,

00:05:04.206 --> 00:05:06.333
such as medical or meteorological,

00:05:06.333 --> 00:05:08.058
or in predictive situations,

00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:11.078
such as business, crime, or disease trends.

00:05:13.369 --> 00:05:16.432
Virtually every field is turning to gathering big data,

00:05:16.432 --> 00:05:18.769
with mobile sensor networks spanning the globe,

00:05:18.769 --> 00:05:21.056
cameras on the ground and in the air,

00:05:21.056 --> 00:05:24.067
archives storing information published on the web,

00:05:24.067 --> 00:05:26.196
and loggers capturing the activities

00:05:26.196 --> 00:05:28.895
of Internet citizens the world over.

00:05:28.895 --> 00:05:31.486
The challenge is on to invent new tools and techniques

00:05:31.486 --> 00:05:33.439
to mine these vast stores,

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:35.240
to inform decision making,

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.496
to improve medical diagnosis,

00:05:37.496 --> 00:05:39.706
and otherwise to answer needs and desires

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:43.663
of tomorrow's society in ways that are unimagined today.
