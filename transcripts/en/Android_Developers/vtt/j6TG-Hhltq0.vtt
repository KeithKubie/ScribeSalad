00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.374
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.720
FRANCOIS ALLIOT: I
really think developing

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.090
a game is like writing a novel.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.770
I studied literature, but
I also studied history.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.490
You can play with history using
cliche, if you want to be funny

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.700
and to create a gap between
something that's old

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.190
and something that's modern.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.260
I really think that coding and
writing are of the same nature.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.610
You have some way
to name things,

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.600
to structure your
logic, which is very

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.595
similar to writing a sentence.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.690
I developed "Reigns" in my
house, me and my computer.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.990
I launched the first version
the week my son was born.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.910
It was a great deadline for me.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.440
"Reigns" was a
nine month project,

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.630
so it's like a pregnancy.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.880
That was a stressful time.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.060
My life changed
because of my son.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.910
I really wanted to be
present in this life.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.664
Working as an indie
game developer

00:01:07.664 --> 00:01:08.580
is very good for that.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.920
It's very easy to
work on your own.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.950
That is not how you make games.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.170
You can't design
every little point.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.000
You have to have the skill
of being able to go to people

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.380
and show your stuff.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.960
It brings a new
perspective and new ideas.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.480
That's super important.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.320
Once you are able
to try new things,

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.360
it gives freedom, so I may
go to work wherever I want,

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.065
and I'm able to work with people
from everywhere in the world.

00:01:46.065 --> 00:01:49.420
I look back on the journey I've
been on in such short time,

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.060
and it's a little overwhelming.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.860
"Reigns" is a mix of Tinder
and "Game of Thrones."

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.530
Swipe your own adventure.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.620
We used a lot of evocation.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.170
With just a few words
and a few sentences,

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.240
you should be able to imagine
yourself in the skin of a king.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.910
I think the first time I
was happy with the game

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.080
was when I saw someone playing
and they started to laugh,

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.568
and that's the moment I knew
we had something different.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.240
Google Play was helpful
to build success,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.160
to push the game at that
very crucial moments

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.790
and pave the way for
1.5 million downloads.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.630
The Google Play indie game
contest was very good for that.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.330
It's importance for your
exposure to go and try things.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.300
You have to make the most of
every opportunity you're given.

00:02:50.548 --> 00:02:53.415
The industry of mobile
games is quite new.

00:02:53.415 --> 00:02:55.980
We know our users
are hungry for it.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.390
They want more
stories, more "Reigns."

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.530
We're only scratching the
surface of what we can do.
