so for example there is a fungus that
lives<00:03:57.300><c> inside</c><00:03:57.480><c> of</c><00:03:57.660><c> ants</c><00:03:58.140><c> called</c><00:03:59.070><c> cordyceps</c>

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 align:start position:0%
lives inside of ants called cordyceps
 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.020 align:start position:0%
lives inside of ants called cordyceps
now<00:04:00.690><c> the</c><00:04:01.170><c> fungus</c><00:04:01.530><c> has</c><00:04:01.680><c> to</c><00:04:01.830><c> get</c><00:04:02.040><c> from</c><00:04:02.490><c> one</c><00:04:02.520><c> ant</c>

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 align:start position:0%
now the fungus has to get from one ant
 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:09.800 align:start position:0%
now the fungus has to get from one ant
to<00:04:03.270><c> the</c><00:04:03.360><c> next</c><00:04:03.950><c> and</c><00:04:05.450><c> what</c><00:04:06.450><c> it</c><00:04:06.570><c> does</c><00:04:06.810><c> is</c><00:04:07.220><c> it</c><00:04:08.810><c> it's</c>

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 align:start position:0%
to the next and what it does is it it's
 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.350 align:start position:0%
to the next and what it does is it it's
going<00:04:10.140><c> to</c><00:04:10.260><c> shower</c><00:04:10.680><c> its</c><00:04:11.160><c> spores</c><00:04:11.640><c> down</c><00:04:12.060><c> on</c>

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
going to shower its spores down on
 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.070 align:start position:0%
going to shower its spores down on
healthy<00:04:13.170><c> ants</c><00:04:14.420><c> well</c><00:04:15.420><c> what</c><00:04:15.540><c> that</c><00:04:15.690><c> means</c><00:04:15.900><c> is</c>

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
healthy ants well what that means is
 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.289 align:start position:0%
healthy ants well what that means is
that<00:04:16.109><c> it's</c><00:04:16.470><c> got</c><00:04:16.590><c> to</c><00:04:16.859><c> get</c><00:04:17.010><c> up</c><00:04:17.250><c> above</c><00:04:17.640><c> those</c><00:04:17.910><c> ants</c>

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 align:start position:0%
that it's got to get up above those ants
 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.840 align:start position:0%
that it's got to get up above those ants
so<00:04:19.260><c> how</c><00:04:19.470><c> does</c><00:04:19.530><c> it</c><00:04:19.739><c> do</c><00:04:19.890><c> that</c><00:04:19.920><c> what</c><00:04:20.310><c> it</c><00:04:20.400><c> does</c><00:04:20.609><c> is</c>

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 align:start position:0%
so how does it do that what it does is
 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.540 align:start position:0%
so how does it do that what it does is
it<00:04:20.910><c> infects</c><00:04:21.750><c> an</c><00:04:21.930><c> ant</c><00:04:22.109><c> so</c><00:04:22.560><c> spore</c><00:04:22.920><c> gets</c><00:04:23.160><c> into</c><00:04:23.430><c> an</c>

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 align:start position:0%
it infects an ant so spore gets into an
 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.400 align:start position:0%
it infects an ant so spore gets into an

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
mature immune system yet so there's
 

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.370 align:start position:0%

nothing there to keep toxoplasma in
 

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:23.380 align:start position:0%
nothing there to keep toxoplasma in
check<00:10:22.650><c> and</c><00:10:22.950><c> so</c>

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:23.390 align:start position:0%
check and so
 

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.630 align:start position:0%
check and so
replicate<00:10:23.870><c> like</c><00:10:24.050><c> crazy</c><00:10:24.320><c> can</c><00:10:25.220><c> cause</c><00:10:25.400><c> brain</c>

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:25.640 align:start position:0%
replicate like crazy can cause brain
 

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:30.370 align:start position:0%
replicate like crazy can cause brain
damage<00:10:25.850><c> it's</c><00:10:26.390><c> it's</c><00:10:26.750><c> not</c><00:10:27.050><c> a</c><00:10:27.080><c> good</c><00:10:27.290><c> thing</c><00:10:29.380><c> yeah</c>

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:30.380 align:start position:0%
damage it's it's not a good thing yeah
 

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
damage it's it's not a good thing yeah
so<00:10:30.770><c> so</c><00:10:31.580><c> there</c><00:10:31.790><c> we</c><00:10:31.910><c> are</c><00:10:31.940><c> a</c><00:10:32.830><c> billion</c><00:10:33.830><c> people</c>

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:34.010 align:start position:0%
so so there we are a billion people
 

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:36.310 align:start position:0%

toxoplasma in their brains and we know

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:42.140 align:start position:0%
that it can affect a mammal brains and
 

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.950 align:start position:0%
that it can affect a mammal brains and

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:06.980 align:start position:0%
it's it's evidence that can't be just
