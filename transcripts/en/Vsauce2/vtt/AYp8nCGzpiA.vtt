00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.630
Vsauce!

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:02.790
Kevin here.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.790
Teleport to Mars and hop into your flying
car.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:06.790
Maybe.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:12.019
Our expectation that sci-fi technologies would
become reality -- like flying cars and Moon

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:17.480
colonies -- came from the pace of innovation
leading up to the Cold War Space Race.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.420
If man can go from flying across the Atlantic
Ocean to landing on the Moon in only 50 years,

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.279
then surely by 2015 we’ll all have flying
cars.

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.460
Well, the problem with flying cars is basically
everything.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.641
Current models are really roadable aircrafts,
because combining a great plane and a great

00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:40.620
car creates something that’s neither.&nbsp;

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.710
Safety is also an issue.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.940
Driving in two dimensions is already dangerous
with over 1.2 million fatalities worldwide

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.370
each year - and cars falling out of the sky
would make matters worse.&nbsp;

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.890
Realistically, flying cars have to be completely
automated.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.030
What we really need is a scientific breakthrough
that solves taking off and landing from your

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.049
driveway without giant noisy propellers, or
that keeps us from having to drive carplanes

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:15.900
to the airport... like somehow manipulating
quantum gravity, which at this point is still

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.130
theoretical.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.189
Teleportation is actually possible - it’s
just really hard.

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:26.619
Quantum teleportation allows us to transmit
the state of an atom or photon over long distances,

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.729
with the current record being a photon teleported
over 88 miles.

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.149
The process works something like this: You
have three photons with quantum states A,

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.950
B and C. B and C are entangled and remain
entangled whether they’re in the same room

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.969
or one is on Mars.

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:50.630
You basically measure the photons and use
that information to turn to C into A, and

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.549
effectively teleport the subatomic particle
state data of A -- not its actual physical

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.789
matter -- to Mars.

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.880
The problem with teleporting a human is the
amount of data we’re made up of.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:11.310
A calculation by the University of Leicester
puts us at approximately 2.6 x 10^42 bits

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:18.710
- and transferring that on a bandwidth of
30GHz would take 350,000 times longer than

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.730
the universe has existed.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.310
Also, to teleport this way, you would have
to die and be reconstructed, which raises

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.130
concerns about the human soul, spirit or consciousness
and whether that’s all just data that can

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.450
be measured and copied.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.810
And you can’t teleport to a place humans
have never been before - you could only teleport

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.430
to a lab stocked with a pile of atoms waiting
to re-construct you.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.010
Space colonies require a massive amount of
will and investment.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.760
A recent study suggests that a minimum of
10,000 people are needed to provide the genetic

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.250
diversity a self-sufficient space colony requires.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:05.320
A fleet of 25 ships holding 3 passengers each
with a roughly two year round-trip time would

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.080
take 266 years to transport 10,000 people
to Mars.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.690
It would be much easier to start by setting
up a dome colony on the Moon, sections of

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.750
which get almost eternal light for solar power
and greenhouses.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.040
Other parts of the Moon even have access to
large deposits of water ice - although it’s

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.010
so widely distributed, we’d need to develop
a way to harvest it.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.690
While there, we’d learn everything from
paraterraforming, which is creating a pressurized

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.260
air-tight roof, to how lunar gravity affects
pregnancies.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.770
We can take that knowledge to Mars, which
may hold the key to discovering extraterrestrial

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.710
microbial life.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.760
This could show us a different model for biology.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.560
Life on Earth all has roughly the same chemical
makeup, so comparing it to a new biological

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.640
system would greatly advance our understanding
of biotechnology and medicine.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.620
So the universe could be filled with single
planet species that have gone extinct…but

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.240
we don’t have to be one of them.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.750
And as always - thanks for watching!
