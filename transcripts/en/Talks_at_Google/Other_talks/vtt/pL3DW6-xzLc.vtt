00:00:07.332 --> 00:00:08.540
SHANEE NISHRY: Hey, everyone.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.230
Good to have you here.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.090
You may heard of him as the man
who will make you live forever,

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.940
or at least until
you get hit by a car.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.680
But here he is, Aubrey de Grey.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.546
AUBREY DE GREY:
Thank you, Shanee.

00:00:24.546 --> 00:00:26.370
I like the way that
Shanee introduces me.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.690
It's great.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.935
I've had the good fortune to be
introduced by her twice today.

00:00:30.935 --> 00:00:31.670
All right.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.330
So thank you for coming.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.800
I'm going to try and
tell you all about what

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.350
we are doing at SENS
Research Foundation.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.250
I have already made
my first mistake,

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.790
which to leave the
clicker on my chair.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.150
So as Shanee said, we are
interested in stopping you

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.690
from getting sick
as you get old.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.180
It has been a source
of frustration to me

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.440
that we get sick as we get
old, for quite some time.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.330
And an even greater
source of frustration

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.410
that it isn't a sort of
frustration for everybody.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.200
So I'm trying to change that.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.630
But also, of course, actually
change the facts of the matter,

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.380
to try to actually
deliver medicines

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.760
that will allow us
to stay healthy.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.530
And so I'm going to spend
the next hour telling you

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.620
all about how.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.440
First of all, the success story.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.980
So this is, simply
for illustration,

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.360
statistics from the USA
showing the proportion

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.790
of the population that are
over the age of 65, which

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.660
was way down at 8% or
so in 1950 and it's

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.520
projected to be up around 22% in
2050, which is pretty dramatic.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.360
And, of course, this is
a cause for celebration,

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:53.350
because it is the consequence
of a great deal of success

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.810
over the past 100 or 150
years in bearing down

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.340
on the diseases that
used, historically,

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.500
to kill an awful lot
of people in infancy,

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.700
or in childbirth, and so on.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.845
And the result is that
pretty much everybody

00:02:06.845 --> 00:02:10.840
is surviving long enough to
reach the age of 65 or more.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.730
But it also has, of course,
created some problems.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.290
The economic
problems are perhaps

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.432
foremost in many
people's minds right now.

00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:22.390
And again, here, I'm just
showing US statistics

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.330
for illustration.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.788
But, of course, it's the same
throughout the industrialized

00:02:25.788 --> 00:02:26.500
world.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.029
We have this problem that
even though the economy has

00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:32.320
been growing nice and fast--
I'm going to use this one,

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.696
where you can actually
see my pointer.

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:37.480
I've never understood why these
screens can't made to actually

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.700
reflect a laser point of
light, even-- whatever.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.030
So, yes.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.080
So this is the US economy,
the red line going up

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.340
at a nice, steady rate.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.290
And if you look at the rate of
medical expenditure in the US

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.380
over the same time period, which
is the last 50 years or so,

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.280
then it looks perfectly
manageable really.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.830
It doesn't look
particularly scary.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.120
But it's a great
deal scarier if you

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.930
take the trouble to divide
one by the other, which

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.880
is where the green
line comes from.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.090
And the green line shows
obviously therefore

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.670
the proportion of the GDP that
is being spent on medical care.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.090
And it's gone up from
5%, 50 years ago,

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.700
to 18%, which is
extremely scary.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.690
And, of course,
is the reason why

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.784
we have all these concerns
about pension funds

00:03:21.784 --> 00:03:23.700
running out of money,
and Medicare running out

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.290
of money, and so on.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.580
So the question is,
first of all, why?

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.800
Why have we got this
situation in the first place?

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.940
Putting it in starker
terms, why have the diseases

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.970
and disabilities of old age,
which, of course, dominant

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.180
medical expenditure today, why
have they been so much more

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.170
resistant to
medical intervention

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.980
than the infectious diseases
that we have more or less

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.510
entirely eliminated over
the past century or so?

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.650
This is actually
pretty paradoxical

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.760
when you think about it.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.770
And in order to
answer this question,

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.860
the first thing I
think we need to do

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.420
is to ask ourselves
what is aging anyway?

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.940
What is the ultimate substrate
for these age-related diseases?

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.130
So I'm going to give you
a definition of aging

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.950
now, that I'm going to be
using for the rest of the talk.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.730
And this definition
is specifically

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.100
geared to trying to eliminate
the distractions that often

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.416
come when aging is discussed.

00:04:21.416 --> 00:04:23.040
There are many
definitions of aging out

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.450
there that really do more harm
than good because they just

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.860
confuse the issue.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.070
But this one brings it
down to its essentials.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.760
And I think it's useful.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.570
Essentially, what
I'm trying to do here

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.320
is to emphasize that the
aging of living organisms

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.250
is really no different
at the bottom line

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.900
from aging of inanimate
subjects, like cars,

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.530
or airplanes, or whatever.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.500
It is simply a fact of
physics, never mind biology,

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.830
that machines with
moving parts do

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.070
themselves damage
as a side effect

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.080
of their normal operation.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:03.970
And it's also a fact of physics
that that damage accumulates

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:09.030
and, therefore, eventually
it exceeds the level

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.880
that the machine is
set up to tolerate.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.672
So that's true for a car.

00:05:13.672 --> 00:05:14.755
It's true for an airplane.

00:05:14.755 --> 00:05:16.088
And it's true for a human being.

00:05:16.088 --> 00:05:18.610
It's true for the human body.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.570
The human body does a lot
of different types of damage

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.780
to itself, which I'll be getting
onto over the next while.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.120
And, therefore, we are
subject to a whole bunch

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.050
of different eventual
failure modes,

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.840
so to speak, of the body.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.420
And that's really
all it's about.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.250
So really what that
means is that we

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.700
must address a very
fundamental misconception that

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.820
is prevalent within
society today concerning

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.800
the diseases of old
age on which we spend

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.380
so much money, diseases
like Alzheimer's, and most

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.440
cancers, and
cardiovascular disease,

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.941
and type 2 diabetes, and
osteoarthritis, and so on,

00:05:58.941 --> 00:06:01.160
and so forth.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.670
These diseases are normally
viewed as diseases.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.810
In other words, they're
viewed as, in some sense,

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.600
similar to infections,
and potentially amenable

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.720
to the same kind of
medical interventions

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.070
that infections are amenable to.

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.650
But they're not.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.580
They're actually
all part and parcel

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.440
of one single process,
the accumulation of damage

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.670
that the body does to
itself in the course

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:27.690
of its normal operation.

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.690
So not only are
they, as we all know,

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.420
widespread and staggeringly
costly, but they are universal.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.280
The only way that you will
not get a particular disease

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.500
of aging is if you die
beforehand of something else.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.360
You are going to get it.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.275
And furthermore, they
not medically curable

00:06:45.275 --> 00:06:47.330
in the strict sense
of the word "curable."

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:48.788
What do I mean by
the strict sense?

00:06:48.788 --> 00:06:51.960
I simply mean that we cannot
eliminate them from the body

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.330
in the way that we can
eliminate an infection.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.172
If you eliminate an
infection, then the person

00:06:57.172 --> 00:06:58.880
isn't going to suffer
from that infection

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.120
again unless they
get reinfected.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.020
But you can't do
that with things

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.790
that are a side effect of
being alive in the first place,

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:09.330
other than by eliminating being
alive in the first place, which

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.380
would kind of defeat the object.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.460
So let's not do that.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.580
But that does not
necessarily mean

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.430
that we can't address
the diseases of old age

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:20.560
using medicine.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.250
It just means that we have
to rethink our starting point

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.350
in designing the medical
interventions that we

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:27.290
might be use.

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.710
I'd like to put it this
way, even more starkly.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:33.150
Most people think of
the various causes

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.977
of ill health along the lines
that I'm showing in this table.

00:07:36.977 --> 00:07:38.435
There are various
types of disease.

00:07:38.435 --> 00:07:40.680
There's infections,
communicable diseases.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.570
And there are
congenital diseases

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.290
that a small
proportion of us have

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.816
because we got dodgy DNA
of one sort or another one.

00:07:48.816 --> 00:07:51.780
And then there are the
chronic age-related diseases,

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:56.000
which are the subject of
so much concern and so much

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.770
expenditure today.

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.670
And then, in most
people's minds,

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:01.680
there is this completely
separate category

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.810
called aging itself,
which is composed

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:07.710
of these nonspecific, rather
poorly defined things,

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:10.820
like sarcopenia, which
is the decline of muscle

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.430
mass in the elderly;
or a gain of fat mass;

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:16.630
or a decline in function of
the immune system, these things

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.100
that we don't really
think of diseases.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.810
That's what most people
have in their minds when

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:23.070
it comes to ill health.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.850
But it's nonsense.

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:28.494
This is the way that we ought to
be thinking about all of this.

00:08:28.494 --> 00:08:29.910
All the columns
are the same here.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:32.710
It's just where the black
line is that's changed.

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:35.370
There are diseases and
then there's aging.

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:38.880
But the diseases of old
age are part of aging.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.409
The only difference between
column three and column four

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:45.070
here is that column
three consists

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:47.580
of those aspects of aging
that we have taken the trouble

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:50.030
to give disease-like names to.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.320
Its purely semantic and no more.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.320
That is an absolutely
fundamental thing

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.860
that I'm going to be leaning
on for the rest of the talk.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:59.943
So I wanted to make sure
you have it in your heads

00:08:59.943 --> 00:09:02.500
very clearly at the outset.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.076
Now, what does this
mean in economic terms?

00:09:05.076 --> 00:09:07.700
I mean we can look at it in many
terms, humanitarian of course.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.332
But let's just do it
in terms of economics.

00:09:10.332 --> 00:09:11.790
And here, for the
moment, I'm going

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:14.980
to move away from medical
expenditure to the expenditure

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.650
on medical research
because, unfortunately, it's

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:20.870
the same story, perhaps
in even starker terms.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:23.081
And again, I'm going to
use US statistics just

00:09:23.081 --> 00:09:25.080
for illustration, because
I happen to have them.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.810
But again, this is
absolutely the same

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:28.910
across the industrialized world.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:31.290
So the NIH, the National
Institute of Health,

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:34.440
is the counterpart of
the Medical Research

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.500
Council in the UK.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:40.240
It's the government body that
is responsible for essentially

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.290
all public expenditure
on medical research.

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:47.370
And it has a nice healthy
budget of $30 billion a year.

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:51.060
But only 3% of that
budget is spent

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.510
on aging, the National
Institute on Aging.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.670
That is pretty bad
news given that

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:58.210
the vast majority of
medical expenditure

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:00.150
and, of course, suffering
caused by disease

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.850
and so on, in the US,
is driven by aging.

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:04.340
It doesn't make sense.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.250
But that's how it is.

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:07.370
That's bad.

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:10.440
But it's not nearly
as bad as it gets.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.590
Even within the National
Institute on Aging,

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:15.920
only about one sixth of that
budget, that $1 billion,

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.980
is spent on understanding
the biology of aging.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:22.720
The rest goes on specific
research on Alzheimer's disease

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:28.240
and/or geriatric medicine,
or even social gerontology,

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.260
studying how to preserve the
dignity of the elderly, things

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.140
like that.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:32.650
Which is all very well.

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:33.650
They're important stuff.

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:38.180
But it's not what would actually
give the bang for the buck.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.690
So it's a disgrace
that it's so small.

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:42.800
And that's not the
end of the story.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.040
The fact is that even
within the Division

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.920
of Aging Biology of
the NIA, of the NIH,

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.990
the amount that's actually spent
on doing something about aging

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:54.812
is way under the 10%.

00:10:54.812 --> 00:10:56.520
That number, $10
million, I've got there,

00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:00.100
is a very generous estimate.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.060
Really, that's amazing.

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:05.934
Most gerontology consists of--
it's a bit like seismology.

00:11:05.934 --> 00:11:07.350
People who study
earthquakes, they

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:09.990
understand that what they
study is bad for you,

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:13.030
but they're not proposing to
actually do anything about it.

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:15.710
It's all about just getting
out of the way really.

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:17.870
So it's a bit sad.

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:20.270
I mean to put it in real
perspective, what we're talking

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:22.890
about here is that my little
foundation, the SENS Research

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:25.820
Foundation that's been created
around my work, which has only

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.380
existed for a few
years, and we only

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.340
have a budge of $4
or $5 million a year,

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:34.350
it's on the same order
as the US government.

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:35.780
That is fairly shocking.

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:37.570
So something better
be done really.

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:40.811
And that's why I go around the
world giving talks like this.

00:11:40.811 --> 00:11:42.854
This is essentially
where we are today.

00:11:42.854 --> 00:11:45.270
If you look at the bottom of
this diagram, what I'm saying

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:46.680
is what I told you already.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.720
Metabolism causes
damage, causes pathology.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.950
In other words, the
network of processes

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:54.400
that keep us alive from
one day to the next,

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.790
which is what biologists
call metabolism,

00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:02.100
causes various types of
molecular and cellular change

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.510
to the composition and
structure of the body, which

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:05.780
I'm calling damage.

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:07.240
And that damage accumulates.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.140
And eventually, when it
exceeds a certain threshold,

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:11.760
it impacts the
function of the body.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.280
And that's when the diseases
and disabilities of old age

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.070
begin to emerge and to progress.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:21.530
And all of what
we try to do today

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:26.390
to attenuate and alleviate
the pathologies of old age

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:29.500
consists of what I'm calling
here the geriatrics approach,

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:30.770
geriatric medicine.

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:34.370
It means, in a nutshell,
completely ignoring everything

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:36.490
that I've told you in
the last five minutes.

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:39.890
It means pretending that
the diseases of old age

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:42.990
are just like infections and
can be eliminated from the body.

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:45.629
It's obviously
complete nonsense.

00:12:45.629 --> 00:12:47.420
First of all, for the
reason I've told you,

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.980
namely the damage, it's
continuing to accumulate.

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:52.350
So obviously,
anything that comes

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:54.580
under the geriatrics
heading is going

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:57.530
to become progressively less
effective as time goes on

00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:00.670
and as the damage becomes
more and more irresistible.

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:03.000
And secondly, because the
pathologies of old age

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.427
are quite numerous.

00:13:04.427 --> 00:13:06.510
You're not supposed to be
able to read this slide.

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:07.670
Don't worry.

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:11.170
This is simply a nice selection
of the things that go wrong

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:14.600
with us as we get older and
that we would rather didn't.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.170
So it's completely hopeless.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:18.980
But we spent a spectacular
amount of money on it.

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:22.050
Now, I am by no means the
first person to point this out.

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:24.530
For the past 100 years, there
have been a few people out

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:28.480
there trying to get people to
understand that actually if we

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.020
want to do anything
about aging, we

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:33.190
have to intervene at an earlier
stage in the chain of events,

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:35.190
in the chain of events
that I've just shown you.

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.840
And that's what has given
rise to what I'm calling here

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.590
the gerontology approach,
which is the approach favored

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:45.521
and pursued by that rare
breed of people who study

00:13:45.521 --> 00:13:48.020
the biology of aging with a
view to actually doing something

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.800
about it in due course.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.450
However, that approach
has also failed completely

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:56.390
to deliver any kind
of actual impact

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:58.010
on the ill health of old age.

00:13:58.010 --> 00:13:59.170
Why should it be?

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:01.960
Well, what is the
gerontology approach?

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:05.420
It consists of essentially
trying to clean up metabolism,

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:09.210
trying to slow down the
rate at which metabolism

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:10.670
creates damage.

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:12.527
And that sounds
like a great idea.

00:14:12.527 --> 00:14:14.110
Because certainly
if we could do that,

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:16.420
it would postpone the age
at which the damage reaches

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.770
a pathogenic quantity.

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:21.630
But there's a couple of problems
with the gerontology approach

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:22.185
too.

00:14:22.185 --> 00:14:27.150
The first problem is that
it's only slowing down

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:28.750
the accumulation of damage.

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:33.860
So that means that the
later you start the therapy,

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:36.700
the less benefit
you're going to see.

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.270
The less time you're
going to have to extend,

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:43.430
before the pathogenic
threshold is reached.

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:45.690
And that's a bit of a
shame because some of us

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:48.440
may already have the misfortune
to be in middle age or older

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:51.650
by the time that the therapies
in question are even developed.

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:53.360
So that's a bit of a shame.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.240
But worse than that,
the gerontology approach

00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:00.070
suffers a problem that is rather
analogous to this problem,

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:04.750
namely-- there we
go-- this problem.

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:07.930
Metabolism is
rather complicated.

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:12.217
This is a simplified
diagram of a small subset

00:15:12.217 --> 00:15:14.300
of what we know about how
metabolism really works,

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:15.730
about how the body works.

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:17.330
And as you can see,
it's a bit hairy.

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:20.260
And as engineers, or as people
who work with engineers,

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:24.510
I'm sure you will understand
that it's pretty implausible

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:26.550
that we would be
able to, in some way,

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:32.820
tweak this vast network
of uncommented spaghetti

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:36.890
code in a manner that would
stop it from doing the thing we

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:39.240
don't want it to do,
namely creating damage,

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.110
without also stopping
it from doing stuff

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:44.620
that we do want it to do,
like keeping us alive.

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:46.010
So it's a waste of time really.

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:47.593
There's no way in
the world that we're

00:15:47.593 --> 00:15:49.219
going to actually
make this work.

00:15:49.219 --> 00:15:51.760
But if that the end of my story,
I wouldn't be standing here.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:52.420
You knew that.

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:54.600
So what's the "get out?"

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.530
How do we extract
ourselves from this?

00:15:56.530 --> 00:16:00.080
Well, ultimately what we do
is we go back to the analogy

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.030
that I started with
some minutes ago.

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:04.870
This car is more
than 100 years old.

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:07.050
And, of course, there
aren't many cars like this.

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:11.140
But they're not all that rare.

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:13.610
The point I want to
highlight about this car

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:18.510
is that it was not
designed to last 100 years.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:21.830
It was designed to last maybe
10 or 15 years before it would

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:25.590
fall apart and you
go and get a new one.

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:29.470
And the reason it's lasted
so long is understood.

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:33.815
We all know that the way that
enthusiasts allow their cars

00:16:33.815 --> 00:16:38.430
to live a long time is by
doing really comprehensive

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:40.740
preventative
maintenance on them,

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.830
by simply repairing the
damage that the cause does

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:46.870
to itself as a side effect of
its normal operation, a phrase

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:50.040
that you may recognize
from a few minutes ago.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:55.050
Now, that means that
we can realistically

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:59.230
ask ourselves, well,
maybe we could actually

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:01.097
do the same thing
to the human body.

00:17:01.097 --> 00:17:03.180
Maybe we could engage in
preventative maintenance.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.790
And if it was sufficiently
comprehensive,

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:07.480
maybe it would have
the same effect.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:12.859
It would greatly extend
the healthy longevity

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:17.560
of the machine that we call the
human body beyond the longevity

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:21.130
that it was initially set
up to be able to achieve.

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:25.020
This is what that means in terms
of comparing and contrasting

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:26.760
with the other approaches.

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:30.670
Rather than trying to slow down
the rate at which metabolism

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:34.910
creates damage, as the
gerontology approach tries

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:38.280
to do, or indeed the rate at
which damage creates pathology,

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.320
as the geriatrics
approach tries to do,

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:44.420
instead the proposal is to
uncouple those two processes

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:45.590
from each other.

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:48.330
To actually go in and
periodically repair the damage

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:51.990
so that the damage, even though
it's still being created,

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:55.290
never actually reaches
the pathogenic threshold.

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:58.080
What I'm going to be trying
to persuade you of today,

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:02.980
in the rest of the talk, is that
this approach is very much more

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:04.790
favorable than the other two.

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:09.840
That we have a realistic
chance of pulling it off

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:12.590
within the foreseeable future.

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:14.510
So in order to go
on to that, I'm

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:16.804
going to now start talking
about actual biology.

00:18:16.804 --> 00:18:18.720
I'm not going to get too
technical, obviously.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.540
But I'm going to try to give
you a feel for what this is all

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.330
about.

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:25.170
The first thing we
have to do is to define

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:28.570
the problem in concrete terms,
in down-to-earth, actual

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:30.030
biological terms.

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:32.450
And that is what
this table does.

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:34.980
Here we have a
list of seven types

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.970
of damage, seven
categories of damage.

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:38.910
And as you can see,
each of these things

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:42.340
is a genuine, bona fide,
physical, biological thing.

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:46.570
Cell loss simply means
cells dying and not

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:49.380
being automatically
replaced by the division

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.690
of other cells, a
very simple concept.

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:55.730
And this is a
classification which

00:18:55.730 --> 00:19:00.250
I have been using for this
purpose for quite some time.

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:02.590
Now, you may have a
couple of questions

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:04.200
about this classification.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.987
And I want to answer
them right at the outset.

00:19:06.987 --> 00:19:09.070
The first question you may
have is, well, hang on,

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:12.080
what's so useful about
this classification?

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:15.442
You recognize, as I've
already, in fact, highlighted,

00:19:15.442 --> 00:19:16.900
that there's an
awful lot of things

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.320
that happen during aging.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.820
There are, indeed, an awful lot
of different types of damage

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:21.970
that gone on.

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:24.970
So a thousand things can be
classified, can be grouped,

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:27.360
into seven different categories
in many different ways.

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:30.280
What's so useful about this
one, you may be asking yourself?

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:34.590
The answer is that within
each of these categories

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:39.120
there is a particular generic
type of intervention that

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:43.750
exemplifies, that illustrates,
the maintenance approach.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:47.430
That within each category
there may many examples.

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:50.430
But all of them can be,
in principle anyway,

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:54.400
addressed by, broadly
speaking, the same therapy,

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.440
differing only in details
from one example to another.

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.252
That's the absolutely
fundamental thing

00:19:59.252 --> 00:20:01.460
that you're looking for in
any kind of classification

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:03.330
of a problem into subproblems.

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:06.140
So that's what this
classification is all about.

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:10.470
The second question you
may have is, well, hang on,

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:12.170
how do we know that
this is exhaustive?

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:14.253
How do we know that there
isn't an eighth category

00:20:14.253 --> 00:20:15.280
and a ninth one?

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:18.070
And, of course, we
can't absolutely know.

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:22.070
But the good news
is that we have

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:26.740
at least a good circumstantial
argument that it probably

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.470
is an exhaustive classification.

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:30.240
What is that
circumstantial argument?

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:30.830
Here it is.

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:33.020
It's been the same
classification

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.100
for more than 30 years.

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:38.070
All of these things
have been major topics

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:41.260
of research and discussion
within gerontology

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:43.630
since at least the early 1980s.

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:46.979
Now, one could say, well, that's
not really a fair argument

00:20:46.979 --> 00:20:48.520
because people
weren't really looking

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.900
to classify damage in
this way back then.

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:52.170
And that's kind of true.

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:54.370
But it's increasingly
not true because the fact

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:57.150
is I've been out there,
making a nuisance of myself

00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:59.460
and challenging
people to actually

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:01.290
come up with other
categories to add

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:03.390
to this list for more
than a decade now.

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:05.815
And I do seem to be
getting away with it.

00:21:05.815 --> 00:21:09.710
I am like, you know,
getting away with it.

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:10.900
So that's pretty good news.

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.483
I mean it's a
circumstantial argument.

00:21:12.483 --> 00:21:14.400
But it's quite
compelling really.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:18.570
Now, I'm going to spend a
few minutes now highlighting

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:22.470
the relationship between
damage and pathology.

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:26.010
And this is really important
because ultimately it's

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:27.370
where the rubber hits the road.

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:30.170
At the end of the day, we need
to actually convince ourselves

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:32.700
that if we could repair all
of these types of damage,

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:35.360
we genuinely would
have this effect

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.780
on the various
pathologies of old age.

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.990
What I want to
emphasize to you here

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:45.390
is that the relationship
between damage and pathology

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:49.606
is, in some cases, quite
complex, but it is established.

00:21:49.606 --> 00:21:50.775
It is well known.

00:21:50.775 --> 00:21:52.150
The stuff I'm
going to be talking

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:53.525
about in this
particular section,

00:21:53.525 --> 00:21:56.860
for the next couple of minutes,
is not innovative ideas

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:59.060
without portfolio, that
SENS Research Foundation

00:21:59.060 --> 00:21:59.990
has put forward.

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:02.560
These are things that no
one working in these field

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.150
would dispute.

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:07.580
So let's start with cancer.

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:09.290
Cancer is the simplest example.

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:11.880
Because in this case, it's
pretty much a one to one

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.700
relationship between the
pathology and the damage.

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.210
There's this one
category of damage

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:18.220
that I define as
division-obsessed cells,

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:22.120
in other words, having too many
cells because there are cells

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.990
which are dividing when
they're not supposed to.

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:26.824
That's pretty much the
definition of cancer.

00:22:26.824 --> 00:22:28.573
So it's a nice,
straightforward one to one

00:22:28.573 --> 00:22:30.140
relationship between
a type of damage

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:32.920
and a type of
age-related disease.

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.829
But, in general, it's
not quite like that.

00:22:34.829 --> 00:22:36.120
So the heart is a good example.

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.920
The heart is an
organ that can go

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.740
wrong in a whole bunch of
different ways in old age.

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:43.610
And it turns out that the
different ways it can go wrong

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:46.840
are driven by different
types of damage.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.690
So let's first of all
take atherosclerosis,

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:51.470
the accumulation
of fatty deposits

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:54.190
in the major arteries,
which leads, of course,

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:57.910
to heart attacks and
strokes, and therefore

00:22:57.910 --> 00:22:59.470
to the major killers,
the number one

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:02.320
killer of the Western world.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.970
That comes down, at the end of
the day, to this thing here,

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:07.580
I'm calling intracellular
junk, molecular garbage

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:09.790
that accumulates within cells.

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:11.440
In particular, what
happens here is

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.610
that there are a type
of white blood cell,

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:15.710
called a macrophage,
which goes into the artery

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:17.979
wall for the purpose of
clearing up detritus.

00:23:17.979 --> 00:23:19.020
And it's very good at it.

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:22.600
But the macrophage gets
poisoned by contaminants

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.252
in that detritus,
which eventually

00:23:25.252 --> 00:23:27.460
cause it to become more of
a problem than a solution.

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:29.630
And I will come back
to that at some length

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:32.500
later on because we've done
some quite important work

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:35.460
in addressing that over
the past few years.

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:38.630
The second type of way
that the heart can go wrong

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:41.950
during old age is
arteriosclerosis,

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:44.810
which is the stiffening
of the major arteries.

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:47.920
This is something that is very
important in terms of pathology

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:51.250
because it leads to increased
blood pressure in the elderly,

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:53.770
and therefore to things
like kidney failure.

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:58.830
And the ultimate molecular
driver of arteriosclerosis

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:01.570
is this thing at the bottom,
in pink, the stiffening

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:03.990
of this lattice of proteins
called the extracellular

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:07.540
matrix, which essentially
gives each of our organs

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:09.677
their shape and physical
properties that it has.

00:24:09.677 --> 00:24:11.510
And, in particular, the
extracellular matrix

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:15.590
of the major arteries is
extremely essential in terms

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:17.590
of giving them the
elasticity that they

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:21.460
need to dampen the pulsation of
the heart, of the heart beat,

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:26.170
and thereby protect the more
fragile capillaries and smaller

00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:30.070
parts of the circulation
from the blood pressure.

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:32.320
So that's arteriosclerosis.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.280
The extracellular
matrix becomes less

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:36.950
elastic as a result of
chemical modifications.

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:38.730
And we need to fix that.

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:41.820
Then there's amyloidosis,
which actually

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:43.660
has been discovered
quite recently

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:46.290
to be a major killer
of the really elderly.

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:49.080
People who live more
than 105, 110, it

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.520
turns out that most of them,
certainly half of them,

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:56.680
die of a disease called senile
cardiac amyloidosis, which

00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:00.120
is essentially the accumulation
of molecular garbage

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:03.560
outside the cell, that
thing I wrote in blue here.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.460
That's all about
a type of protein

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:10.160
that gets into this kind
of fibers that essentially

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:13.670
weaken the joints between
the various muscle cells that

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:17.480
make the heart up and
weaken its ability to beat.

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.900
So that's rather bad for
you, eventually, of course.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:23.110
And then finally
there is cell loss.

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:25.220
The heart actually does
not beat on its own.

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:27.320
It only beats when
the brain tells it to.

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.880
And the cells in the heart
that mediate that signal,

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.660
they're called pacemaker cells.

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:35.340
And it turns out that they
don't maintain their numbers

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:36.000
during age.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.010
They die progressively.

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:38.700
And eventually, you
haven't got enough of them

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.491
and the heart stops
listening to the brain.

00:25:40.491 --> 00:25:42.440
And it just doesn't
beat anymore.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.380
So that's another way
that the heart can stop.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.460
So, as you can see,
the relationship here,

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:48.850
between damage and this
particular type of pathology,

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:51.060
is quite a complicated
one, a many to one

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:52.580
relationship for sure.

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:55.930
But, like I said earlier,
it's really well understood.

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:58.450
And that's the important
thing I want to get across.

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:00.690
The same with
Alzheimer's disease.

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:04.360
Alzheimer's disease was defined
about 100 years ago or more,

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.190
as the combination
of these two things

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:08.370
here, a type of
junk inside neurons

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:11.866
called tangles and another
type outside called plaques.

00:26:11.866 --> 00:26:13.740
And now, of course, we
also know that there's

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:16.420
a lot of cell death in
Alzheimer's disease.

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:18.380
So again, a complex
relationship, but a well

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.170
understood one.

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:22.900
The big thing to take into
account here and to emphasize

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:25.560
is that these
nonspecific aspects

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:28.410
of aging, that we don't give
disease-like names to, the same

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:29.246
applies.

00:26:29.246 --> 00:26:31.120
Most of these things--
pretty much everything

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.350
except division-obsessed
cells-- ultimately

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:37.610
can be linked causally to
various types of decline

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:39.260
in function, like
loss of muscle,

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:41.404
or loss of immune
function, and such like.

00:26:41.404 --> 00:26:42.570
So this is really good news.

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:44.972
We have a very clear
idea of this linkage.

00:26:44.972 --> 00:26:46.680
All right then, enough
about the problem.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.290
Let's go to the solution.

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:52.446
So what is the preventative
maintenance approach?

00:26:52.446 --> 00:26:55.510
It falls into these
four types of approach,

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:57.380
replace stuff
that's gone missing;

00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:58.850
remove stuff that
has accumulated,

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:01.230
that you don't want;
sometimes in situ repair

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:05.094
of stuff that you don't want
to remove or to replace;

00:27:05.094 --> 00:27:06.260
and sometimes reinforcement.

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:08.970
That means essentially breaking
the link between damage

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:12.610
and pathology, somehow
doing something to the body.

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:15.080
That means that the damage
can still accumulate,

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:18.670
but it no longer actually
has any pathogenic effects.

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:22.680
And when we come down to
specifics, it's all about this.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.260
So I won't go through
this in detail.

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:26.680
I'm going to touch on a
couple of the examples

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.870
here in a moment, to look at
the details of the pathologies.

00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:32.820
But essentially what
I'm showing here

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:35.550
is that we know exactly how
to do this in principal.

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:37.610
Some of this, much
more than in principle.

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:39.200
Lets take cell loss.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:45.190
The main way-- the generic way
to restore cellularity, cell

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:49.050
number, to a given tissue is,
of course, stem cell therapy.

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:51.550
That's true for cell
loss during aging,

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:54.760
just as it is in terms of
any kind of acute trauma

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:57.680
or injury for which stem
cell therapy may originally

00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.200
have been developed.

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.430
Parkinson's disease is
a great example of this.

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:04.160
It's a disease in which
cells in one particular part

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.420
of the brain die
unusually rapidly.

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:10.520
And stem cell therapies
for Parkinson's, they

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.857
were first attempted
nearly 20 years ago,

00:28:12.857 --> 00:28:15.440
when we really didn't know what
we were doing with stem cells.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:18.720
But even then, they sometimes
worked really, really well.

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.230
And now, there's a
great deal of resurgence

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:23.530
of interest in this and new
clinical trials going on.

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:27.150
And I think there's quite a
good chance, at least 50%,

00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:29.185
that within as little
as 10 years from now,

00:28:29.185 --> 00:28:31.310
we will be able to say that
Parkinson's disease has

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:33.767
been cured.

00:28:33.767 --> 00:28:35.683
So I won't go on to the
others now because I'm

00:28:35.683 --> 00:28:37.790
going to touch on some
of them in detail.

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:39.720
What I'm going to do
is talk about how far

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:40.670
advanced they are.

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:43.410
And I'm going to start with the
ones that are most advanced.

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:47.370
So I'll just mention clinical
trials for stem cell therapy.

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:49.370
These are already in
progress, in certain cases.

00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:50.078
And that's great.

00:28:50.078 --> 00:28:51.080
That's wonderful.

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:53.000
And actually, it's
the main reason

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.370
why SENS Research Foundation
doesn't do anything

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:57.450
to speak of, hardly
anything, in the whole area,

00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:01.860
because our contribution
would be a drop in the ocean.

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:04.160
Another case that
I want to highlight

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:07.370
in a little more detail
consists of this business

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:11.880
of molecular garbage outside
the cell, which in general comes

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.460
down to this thing
called amyloid.

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:16.650
Amyloid, as I mentioned earlier,
accumulates in the heart and it

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:19.070
also accumulates in the
brain during Alzheimer's.

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:21.110
That's what female plaques are.

00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:24.800
And 15 years ago, or so, it was
determined, at least in mice,

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:28.330
that one could get rid of this
stuff just by immunization.

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:30.560
Essentially, one could
trigger the immune system

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.130
to engulf the material,
get it inside the cell,

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:34.900
inside phagocytic cells.

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:38.140
And this was enough to get
rid of it, to remove it,

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:40.570
because the machinery
for breaking things down

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:42.370
inside the cell is
much more powerful

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:44.430
than what exists outside.

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:46.860
And this moved, in the case
of Alzheimer's disease,

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:48.480
very rapidly to clinical trials.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.230
And those clinical
trials got to phase III

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:52.630
and reported just a year ago.

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:56.960
And the reaction
was frustrating.

00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:00.260
The trials did not achieve
their clinical endpoints.

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:02.470
That isn't what was frustrating.

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:05.060
I would have been
absolutely amazed

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:07.610
if people, given these
treatments to get rid

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:09.630
of plaques, had
actually exhibited

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:13.780
any significant restoration
of cognitive function.

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:14.760
Why?

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:17.300
Because it's not the whole
of Alzheimer's, dummy.

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:20.532
I mean Alzheimer's is these
three things that happen.

00:30:20.532 --> 00:30:21.990
It's not just
amyloid accumulating.

00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:24.570
It's also tangles accumulating
inside the cell, which

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:25.931
was not targeted by the therapy.

00:30:25.931 --> 00:30:27.305
And so there was
no reason why we

00:30:27.305 --> 00:30:28.980
would expect them to go away.

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:30.430
And similarly,
the cells that had

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:33.300
gone missing, that had died,
were not being replaced.

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.120
There's no clear
chain of causation.

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:36.920
It's not as if we
already had any reason

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:38.600
to believe that if
you remove plaques

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.575
then the tangles would
go away on their own

00:30:40.575 --> 00:30:42.970
or the cells would
somehow regenerate.

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:45.470
I think it's a bit like what
I'm saying at the bottom there.

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:48.710
It's a bit like saying let's
take a car apart and put

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:50.490
the individual
components out in a line.

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:52.390
And then let's pour
burning petrol over them

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:55.150
and we'll expect to see
some kind of motion.

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:58.520
It wouldn't happen really.

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:02.570
So it's frustrating that medical
researchers and scientists

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:06.140
are often rather careless
in their evaluation of how

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:09.510
technology is supposed to work,
especially divide and conquer

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:12.480
technology of this kind.

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.910
Let me talk about another case.

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:17.175
And here I'm going to emphasize
the role of the private sector

00:31:17.175 --> 00:31:20.650
and especially the role
called of venture capital.

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:22.760
Because obviously
in the IT world,

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.250
you guys are quite
tuned into all of that.

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:27.970
And you may be
wondering already why

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:30.670
does a nonprofit, such as
SENS Research Foundation,

00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:33.601
really need to exist, if
all of this is so clear?

00:31:33.601 --> 00:31:35.100
So I'm going to
talk about this case

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:36.640
because it's an
interesting, kind

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:39.670
of intermediate,
transitional case.

00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:41.147
It concerns
death-resistant cells,

00:31:41.147 --> 00:31:42.730
which is a category
that I've defined,

00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:45.702
that simply means "the other
way of having too many cells."

00:31:45.702 --> 00:31:47.410
You can have too many
cells because cells

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:49.159
are dividing when
they're not supposed to.

00:31:49.159 --> 00:31:51.660
That's what cancer is, as
I mentioned a moment ago.

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:55.130
Or you can have too many
cells because cells are not

00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:57.294
dying when they are supposed to.

00:31:57.294 --> 00:31:59.710
People often overlook that
because they think, well, cells

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:01.000
are not supposed to die, right?

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:01.680
But that's not true.

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.305
It turns out of there
are certain parts

00:32:03.305 --> 00:32:05.510
of the body in which
cells are absolutely

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:10.240
required to die in order for
the whole system to function.

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:12.894
So we'd like to be able to
get rid of these things.

00:32:12.894 --> 00:32:14.310
And for a long
time now, I've been

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:15.750
saying that the way to
do this is with something

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:17.640
called suicide
gene therapy, where

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.860
you use engineered
viruses to introduce

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:23.430
a toxic gene into cells.

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:26.840
This gene creates a protein that
will actually kill the cell.

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:30.090
And the way you do it is by
ensuring that the protein is

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:32.110
only synthesized
within the cell,

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:35.060
in the case where the cell has
got into this bad state, where

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:37.100
you'd like to get rid of it.

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:41.210
So this is something that
is routine in the lab,

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:42.680
in mouse experiments.

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:44.110
But it's very
dangerous and so it

00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:47.680
hasn't got to prime
time for the clinic yet.

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:48.333
But it will.

00:32:48.333 --> 00:32:48.833
It will.

00:32:48.833 --> 00:32:51.890
So that was the thing I was
interested in making happen.

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:54.045
And the good news is that
a couple of years ago,

00:32:54.045 --> 00:32:56.420
a group at a very prestigious
institution called the Mayo

00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:59.405
Clinic, actually had a
go at pretty much that.

00:32:59.405 --> 00:33:01.530
What they did was, since
they were working in mice,

00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:04.130
they didn't actually need to
resort to this engineered virus

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:07.070
business of suicide
gene therapy.

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:09.940
They just introduced the
suicide gene transgenetically

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:12.530
so that it was in
every cell in the mouse

00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:14.990
from the time the
mouse was conceived.

00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:19.260
And what they did was they made
a combination of two things.

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:22.400
First of all, they
introduced a second mutation

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.430
into these mice, a
different mutation,

00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:27.440
which caused these
death-resistant cells

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:29.930
to accumulate much,
much more rapidly

00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:31.420
than they normally would.

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:33.740
But which did not
cause any other aspect

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:35.880
of aging to be accelerated.

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:39.250
So these mice basically died of
having too many death-resistant

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:40.400
cells.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.639
And they died pretty quickly.

00:33:41.639 --> 00:33:43.430
They died at less than
half the normal age.

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:46.800
This mouse at the bottom
here is such a mouse.

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:47.900
It's less than a year old.

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:51.320
And it's only got about a
month to live, if it's lucky.

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:54.970
And you can see, it's
very unhealthy already.

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:59.000
So what they did was,
this research group,

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.270
they engineered this suicide
gene into these mice.

00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:05.090
And they engineered this in what
we call a drug inducible way.

00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:07.540
In other words, in such
a manner that they could

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:09.610
activate that gene,
but only, of course,

00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:11.940
in the cells that
they wanted to kill,

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:16.080
by giving the mice some simple
drug in their drinking water.

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.946
Until that time,
even the bad cells

00:34:17.946 --> 00:34:19.820
would not actually die
because they would not

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:23.250
express the suicide gene.

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:26.400
So what they did was they
waited until, let's say, halfway

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:29.770
through these mice's lifespan
before giving them the drug

00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:32.820
and activating the suicide
gene, so that a whole bunch

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:35.250
of these cells would
already be in existence.

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:37.600
And the result was very nice.

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.900
The top mouse there
is one like that,

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:41.198
same age as the bottom one.

00:34:41.198 --> 00:34:42.989
And as you can see,
it's perfectly healthy,

00:34:42.989 --> 00:34:44.739
doing very fine.

00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:47.540
And they measured the
relative health of these mice

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:48.874
in all manner of different ways.

00:34:48.874 --> 00:34:51.164
This graph on the right is
just one of the dozen things

00:34:51.164 --> 00:34:51.860
they did.

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:54.400
It's to do with muscle mass.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.100
So this was all very good news.

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:58.150
Now, here's the
interesting thing.

00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:00.250
They did this in an
academic institution.

00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:03.140
But they decided to go out
and start a startup company.

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:06.700
And they got VC money
really pretty fast.

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:07.792
Why is that interesting?

00:35:07.792 --> 00:35:10.000
The reason it's interesting
is because the experiment

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.990
was extraordinary preliminary.

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:14.890
First of all, it was in mice.

00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:17.340
And we all know that
stuff that's in mice often

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:20.650
takes quite a long time to
translate to the clinic.

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:23.940
Second of all, they were working
in this artificial system

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:27.970
where they had accelerated
one aspect of aging very, very

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:28.950
dramatically.

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:32.080
So there's no evidence from
this experiment showing

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:35.640
that the senescent cells,
these death-resistant cells,

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:38.480
are actually all that bad
for you in a normal mouse,

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:39.940
in a normal lifespan.

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:44.850
So this was really a
bit of a leap of faith.

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:46.620
The third thing that
was very preliminary

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:50.320
about this experiment was that
it was a transgenic experiment,

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:54.910
where they introduced this gene
into the mice that allowed them

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:58.200
to kill the relevant cells
at a point of their choosing.

00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:01.600
Now, tells us absolutely
nothing about what

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:04.987
the actual plausibility is
of the company's business

00:36:04.987 --> 00:36:07.070
plan, which is to create
an actual pharmaceutical,

00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:10.387
a small molecule drug that
would do the same thing.

00:36:10.387 --> 00:36:11.970
There's absolutely
no way that there's

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:13.345
any evidence from
this experiment

00:36:13.345 --> 00:36:15.300
that that is even possible.

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:17.680
And the fourth thing is that
even if you forget all this

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.930
and you just presume investors
were stupid or at least

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:22.425
they thought that their eventual
customers would be stupid,

00:36:22.425 --> 00:36:24.690
that they might be going
for some kind of very

00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:28.424
superficial bottom line, that
bottom line would be longevity.

00:36:28.424 --> 00:36:30.840
There's one thing I haven't
told you about this experiment

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:31.690
so far.

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:34.430
You probably think that
these mice at the top, right,

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:37.100
probably lived a normal
life, like 2 and 1/2 years,

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:39.600
as it gained certainly a year
for the mouse at the bottom.

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:40.850
That turns out not to be true.

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:42.830
It's actually the case
that the mice at the top

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:45.145
died after a year, same
as the mice at the bottom.

00:36:45.145 --> 00:36:47.020
Because it turned out
that was something else

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:49.500
than the gene did,
that the mutation did,

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:51.490
that caused the
accelerated accumulation

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:54.086
of death-resistant
cells, that was not

00:36:54.086 --> 00:36:55.460
to do with
death-resistant cells.

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:57.710
It just basically
made the heart unhappy

00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:59.180
and so they died anyway.

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:02.400
So on every single measure
that you could think of,

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:06.370
this is a massively
preliminary experiment.

00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:07.640
But they got their money.

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.460
How did they do it?

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:13.460
I think that the answer is
a very encouraging answer.

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:17.410
Namely, that investors,
smart investors,

00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:22.000
who are looking at things to
do with the eventual delivery

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.520
and development of anti-aging
medicine that actually works,

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:30.410
have been paying
attention to the numbers.

00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:32.430
They've started paying
attention to the fact

00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:38.720
that the real anti-aging
industry to come,

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.950
the anti-aging industry
consisting of therapies that

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:44.130
work, is going to be
the biggest industry

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:46.470
ever, by a very large margin.

00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:50.100
It's going to be the
industry of all time.

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:52.609
So that, of course,
means that if you

00:37:52.609 --> 00:37:54.650
want to get into it, if
you want make money, then

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:58.450
your calculations of decisions
about whether to go for it

00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:01.310
or not will use
different numbers.

00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:03.500
You will be willing
to accept higher risk.

00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:05.890
You will be willing to
accept a longer time-frame

00:38:05.890 --> 00:38:09.070
before access, all those things.

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:10.370
That seems to be happening now.

00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:13.340
That's why this kind of
thing is actually occurring.

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:16.210
And it's very
heartening, indeed.

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:16.710
All right.

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:19.680
So you may think,
well, OK, that's great.

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:21.180
So even something
really preliminary

00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:22.846
is getting funded by
the private sector.

00:38:22.846 --> 00:38:25.170
Why does SENS
Research Foundation

00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:28.640
need to exist as a nonprofit,
funded by philanthropy?

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:31.170
Well, I'm afraid the
answer is that even

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:33.630
though some things are moving
forward nicely like this,

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:36.920
and they are in the position
also being able to get money

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:40.260
out of venture capital, a lot
of things that need to be done

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:42.970
are still at an earlier
stage than that.

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:44.820
At early enough
that I don't think

00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:48.450
the calculations are
going to fly for a while.

00:38:48.450 --> 00:38:51.210
The mission statement of
SENS Research Foundation

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:54.420
is that we want to create a
rejuvenation biotechnology

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:55.350
industry.

00:38:55.350 --> 00:38:56.320
Don't get me wrong.

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:58.080
We definitely want
that to happen.

00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:00.980
But there are some things where
it's not ready for prime time

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:02.500
yet in the private sector.

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:04.750
And I'm going to give you
an example here because it's

00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:06.590
a good example of the stuff
that we've been doing.

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:08.330
It's showing very
good proof of concept.

00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:11.232
But it still has a
little way to go.

00:39:11.232 --> 00:39:13.990
And it's do with this
thing, molecular garbage

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.891
inside the cell.

00:39:14.891 --> 00:39:16.640
And it comes back to
the number one killer

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:20.020
in the Western world,
atherosclerosis.

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:21.750
Atherosclerosis, as
I mentioned earlier,

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:24.180
starts with white blood
cells, a particular type

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:27.800
of white blood cell called
a macrophage-- excuse

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:31.720
me-- going into the artery
wall and clearing up garbage,

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:32.963
clearing up detritus.

00:39:32.963 --> 00:39:34.120
And it's very good at it.

00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:36.370
It basically recycles
various materials

00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:38.970
and exports them
back out for reuse.

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:40.810
But there are
certain contaminants

00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:43.760
in that detritus which
the macrophage is not

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.000
equipped to handle.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.850
And those contaminants
poison the macrophage.

00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:49.866
And eventually, it doesn't work.

00:39:49.866 --> 00:39:52.240
The particular part of the
macrophages that stops working

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.570
is this thing called
the lysosome, which

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:57.720
is kind of the garbage
disposal machinery of the cell.

00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:01.582
And it's really
an important part.

00:40:01.582 --> 00:40:03.040
So when the lysosome
stops working,

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:04.500
the cell stops being
able to do things

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:05.490
that it used to be able to do.

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:07.073
And eventually it
turns into this kind

00:40:07.073 --> 00:40:09.700
of undead thing called
a foam cell, which

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:11.200
is what we have showing here.

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:15.720
This is the first visible
stage in atherosclerosis.

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:17.990
And actually, all of
us have foam cells

00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:21.220
in our major arteries,
even as young kids.

00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:23.887
But we don't have
very many of them.

00:40:23.887 --> 00:40:26.220
And when we don't have very
many of them, lo and behold,

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:27.420
they're not harmful.

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:29.180
But eventually there's too many.

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:31.304
And the environment,
the other cells around,

00:40:31.304 --> 00:40:32.470
start to get a little angry.

00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:35.730
They get inflamed and bad
things start happening.

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:37.646
More white blood cells
pile in, in an attempt

00:40:37.646 --> 00:40:38.520
to solve the problem.

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:40.550
But they got poisoned
as well, so they

00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:41.729
become part of the problem.

00:40:41.729 --> 00:40:43.020
And the plaque grows and grows.

00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:45.280
And eventually you end up
with the plaque bursting.

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.640
And that's when you got
heart attacks and strokes.

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:49.660
So what could we do about this?

00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:51.896
Well, about 15
years ago I proposed

00:40:51.896 --> 00:40:54.270
that what we really need to
do to stop this kind of thing

00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:56.060
happening-- and a
similar kind of thing

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:59.110
happens with different toxic
molecules in, for example,

00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:01.390
macular degeneration,
the number one

00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:04.940
cause of blindness
in the elderly.

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:06.900
The thing we need
to do is simply

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:10.680
equip the relevant cells
that are being poisoned

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:15.070
with additional machinery
for breaking things down.

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:16.890
So that, in particular,
they can break down

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:19.130
the things that
are poisoning them.

00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:22.830
And it turns out that that's
not so hard as all that.

00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:24.660
In the case of
atherosclerosis, there

00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:26.450
is just one particular compound.

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:28.710
It's called
7-Ketocholesterol, which

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:32.030
appears to be responsible for
at least most of the problem.

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:34.840
It's not by any
means the only thing

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:37.250
that accumulates in
macrophages over time.

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:39.410
But it does seem to
be the most important

00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:42.460
in terms of its abundance
and its toxicity.

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:46.040
And what we decided to
do was to take a leaf out

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:49.117
of the book of environmental
decontamination, not even

00:41:49.117 --> 00:41:50.200
a biomedical field at all.

00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:52.350
So, of course, no one
working in gerontology

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:54.040
knew anything about this.

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:57.000
But what we did was we
simply used the idea

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.070
that you might be able to find
bacteria in the environment,

00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:04.800
in the soil, that could
break down the material that

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:09.020
is poisoning these
macrophages, this compound

00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:10.690
7-Ketocholesterol.

00:42:10.690 --> 00:42:13.290
Now our idea was not,
I should emphasize,

00:42:13.290 --> 00:42:15.020
that having found
such bacteria, we

00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:16.720
would inject them into the body.

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:18.630
I have to think that
might have side effects.

00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:20.760
But what we decided
to do instead

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.970
was, once we found
such bacteria,

00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:27.120
we would identify the genetic
basis for that capability,

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:29.210
the genes and enzymes
that they had,

00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:33.180
that allowed them to break
down these compounds.

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:35.580
And then we would introduce
those genes and enzymes

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:38.410
into human cells,
thereby augmenting

00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:40.970
the capacity of those
cells to break things down.

00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:42.610
So here's the first step.

00:42:42.610 --> 00:42:44.911
And as you can see, this
paper came out in 2008.

00:42:44.911 --> 00:42:46.410
It was actually the
first paper that

00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:50.240
was published out of
work funded by us.

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:51.950
And it went very nicely.

00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:53.430
We found bacteria
that did the job.

00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:55.210
What you're seeing
here is what's

00:42:55.210 --> 00:42:56.790
called an enrichment
culture, where

00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:58.956
we take a whole bunch of
different bacterial strains

00:42:58.956 --> 00:43:01.470
and we give them this
stuff, 7-Ketocholesterol.

00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:03.920
And we don't give them
anything else to live on.

00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:07.220
The idea here is that if
they can break down 7KC,

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:10.150
then they can grow because they
can extract energy from it.

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:11.550
And if they can't, they can't.

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:13.060
So most of these strains can't.

00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:15.350
They just there like lemons,
doing exactly nothing.

00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:17.490
But a couple of them
are doing very fine.

00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:20.320
You've got a couple of strains
there which after only 10 days,

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:23.672
have consumed the
entire material.

00:43:23.672 --> 00:43:25.270
So that's great.

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:27.569
Then we're got to, as I say,
find the genes and enzymes

00:43:27.569 --> 00:43:28.360
that they're using.

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:29.984
And that turned out
not to be too hard.

00:43:29.984 --> 00:43:31.910
This is one way
the way we did it.

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:33.180
It's called mass spectrometry.

00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:35.710
We essentially identified
the breakdown products

00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:39.700
that the bacteria are creating
in the process of breaking down

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:41.250
the original substance.

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:44.160
And that allows us to infer what
enzymatic reaction is occurring

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:46.745
and used by informatics to
identify candidate genes.

00:43:46.745 --> 00:43:47.870
There are other approaches.

00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:50.090
We also used expression
analysis to find

00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:52.650
which genes were being activated
when we gave them the 7KC,

00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:53.280
and so on.

00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:55.200
All these methods seemed
to work pretty well.

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.325
The long and short of it
was we had a few candidate

00:43:57.325 --> 00:43:59.920
genes by about 2010.

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:02.690
That's when things
started getting tricky.

00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:05.300
Step three in this
process is the hard one,

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:08.360
which is to actually get
these enzymes to work

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:09.444
in a human cell.

00:44:09.444 --> 00:44:11.360
The reason that's hard
is because humans cells

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:12.760
are very different
from bacteria.

00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:15.400
Bacteria doesn't
even have lysosomes.

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:16.152
But we managed it.

00:44:16.152 --> 00:44:18.360
First of all, we actually
had to do the localization.

00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:20.401
We have to get our enzymes
to go to the lysosome.

00:44:20.401 --> 00:44:22.580
And this shows that
we could do that.

00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:26.052
The red on the left is a stain
for the lysosome in cells.

00:44:26.052 --> 00:44:27.760
The middle one is our
engineered protein.

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:30.194
And the fact that they're
overlapping reasonably well

00:44:30.194 --> 00:44:31.610
shows us that
plenty of our enzyme

00:44:31.610 --> 00:44:32.776
is going to the right place.

00:44:32.776 --> 00:44:33.664
So that's all good.

00:44:33.664 --> 00:44:35.080
But at the end of
the day, we also

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:36.680
had to show that it worked.

00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:40.830
And that was what we were able
to show maybe 18 months ago.

00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:43.190
This graph is a
summary of the results.

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:46.670
Essentially what it says
is that if you give cells

00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:49.500
a completely insupportable
amount of 7KC,

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:51.140
on the right-hand
end here, then it

00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:52.550
doesn't matter what you've
done to them in terms

00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:53.758
of giving them extra enzymes.

00:44:53.758 --> 00:44:54.910
They die anyway.

00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:57.300
But if you give them a
relatively modest amount

00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:00.350
of this toxic
molecule, then the fact

00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:02.580
that the right-hand bar
of each of these groups

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:05.760
is higher than the other
bars, that basically says

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:08.735
that the cells which
have the enzyme

00:45:08.735 --> 00:45:11.090
seem to be targeted to the
right part of the cell,

00:45:11.090 --> 00:45:12.750
the lysosomes are projected.

00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:16.605
They survive better than other
negative control cells, cells

00:45:16.605 --> 00:45:18.980
that don't have an enzyme, or
they have the wrong enzyme,

00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:22.120
or they have the enzyme not
targeted to the right place.

00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:24.077
So this is a extremely
good proof of concept.

00:45:24.077 --> 00:45:25.160
We're very happy about it.

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:26.540
We have a couple
more steps to go

00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:28.415
before we think we would
be able to take this

00:45:28.415 --> 00:45:30.030
to the private sector.

00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:32.007
First of all, we
would need to get

00:45:32.007 --> 00:45:33.590
this working in a
different cell type.

00:45:33.590 --> 00:45:35.620
We did this in
fibroblasts, which

00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:37.820
happened to be
easy to work with.

00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:39.700
But we need to get it
to work in macrophages.

00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:41.220
Then we need to
move to mouse models

00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:44.236
of cardiovascular
disease and show

00:45:44.236 --> 00:45:45.730
that it's protective
there as well.

00:45:45.730 --> 00:45:46.910
But we're well on our way.

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:51.230
I think I can probably trust you
to understand that this really

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:54.440
is a very effective
proof of concept.

00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:56.010
And we learned a lot more.

00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:58.640
We only have $4 million
a year, or thereabouts.

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:00.570
But we are spending
it very efficiently.

00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:03.980
We have a headquarters in
Mountain View, California,

00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:05.830
just a couple of miles
from the Googleplex,

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:09.210
that has a few thousand square
feet of lab space, where

00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:10.829
we do three of our
major projects.

00:46:10.829 --> 00:46:12.620
And we have more than
a dozen other project

00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:14.200
at various universities
around the world.

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:15.940
That one I just
described to you happens

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:19.160
at Rice University in Houston.

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:21.250
We also have an educational
arm, which I always

00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:22.750
like to mention
because I think it's

00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:25.310
very important to understand
that we're trying to grow

00:46:25.310 --> 00:46:28.419
the next generation of
rejuvenation biotechnologists.

00:46:28.419 --> 00:46:29.960
So that's something
that you can read

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:31.850
about at the website, of course.

00:46:31.850 --> 00:46:35.240
Now, I thought I should mention
a little bit about credibility.

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:37.710
Because maybe 10 years
ago-- some of you

00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:40.780
have already come across
me-- it was actually

00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:43.230
pretty tough to
sell this concept.

00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:46.120
I think you already got the
idea from my early remarks

00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:47.950
that the whole
maintenance approach is

00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:52.300
a big departure from what people
had previously been thinking.

00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:54.110
People who were
working in gerontology

00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:58.600
viewed this whole idea of damage
repair as a complete solution,

00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:01.970
as a very, very
implausible idea.

00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:04.430
It was as far away from
the historical thinking

00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:07.300
as the geriatric
medicine approach was.

00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:10.620
So I had to do a
lot of education.

00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:11.680
And it took a while.

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:15.280
But the good news is that it
really has been very effective.

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:17.840
We are now in the very
heartening position

00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:20.830
of having this kind of research
advisory board, of very

00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:23.830
obviously explicit
endorsers of our approach.

00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:27.390
Every single one of these people
are really, really prestigious

00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:30.690
dignitaries in their various
biological disciplines.

00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:33.180
Now, there are obviously
still a few people out there

00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:34.930
who just refuse to be
educated about this.

00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:37.230
But by and large, the
credibility barrier

00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:40.540
has been breached, which
is very nice to know.

00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:42.372
But still, we're got to do more.

00:47:42.372 --> 00:47:44.330
One thing we have to do,
of course, is publish.

00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:47.320
We have to demonstrate
the validity of what we're

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:49.304
doing in the traditional manner.

00:47:49.304 --> 00:47:50.970
And that's, of course,
what we're doing.

00:47:50.970 --> 00:47:53.350
So these are just a small
selection of the papers

00:47:53.350 --> 00:47:54.767
that we've published recently.

00:47:54.767 --> 00:47:57.350
That one at the top is the one
I've just mentioned, of course,

00:47:57.350 --> 00:48:01.660
the rescue of cells
from 7-Ketocholesterol.

00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:03.480
But we've done a
lot more than that.

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.230
A couple months ago,
we had a lovely paper

00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:07.660
in a very prestigious journal,
"The Journal of Biological

00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:11.180
Chemistry," showing
that we could address

00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:13.870
senile cardiac amyloidosis
using antibodies

00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:15.655
that would break the stuff down.

00:48:15.655 --> 00:48:17.030
A couple of other
examples there.

00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:18.460
So things are going nicely.

00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:21.650
But, of course, there's
still a very long way to go.

00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:22.560
I'm pretty much done.

00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:25.960
And I'm just going to spend a
few minutes on other matters.

00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:27.520
The first thing I'm
going to tell you

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:29.690
is what I'm not
going to tell you.

00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:31.470
In other words,
I don't really do

00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:33.590
the sociological considerations.

00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:34.819
I do have to.

00:48:34.819 --> 00:48:37.360
Some of you probably know that
I do a brutal amount of media.

00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:39.130
I do probably 100
interviews a year.

00:48:39.130 --> 00:48:41.930
And the bulk of my time
in those interviews

00:48:41.930 --> 00:48:45.005
is spend answering questions
along the lines of, oh, dear,

00:48:45.005 --> 00:48:46.750
where are we going to
put all the people,

00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:52.174
or won't dictators live forever,
or won't we all get bored?

00:48:52.174 --> 00:48:53.840
Shall we say, I have
become a little bit

00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:56.640
bored myself of these questions.

00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:59.680
I regard them as being
ultimately founded

00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:04.040
on a degree of
myopia with regard

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:07.700
to the importance of this
work, a degree of ability

00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:10.200
to put out of one's mind
the fact that we have

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:12.070
quite a bad problem
today with aging,

00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:16.650
namely a problem of 100,000
people every single day

00:49:16.650 --> 00:49:17.520
dying of it.

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:18.977
That's 2/3 of all deaths.

00:49:18.977 --> 00:49:20.560
In the developed
world, it's something

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:23.104
like 90% of all deaths.

00:49:23.104 --> 00:49:24.770
And, of course, it's
not just the death.

00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:26.603
It's also all the
suffering that most people

00:49:26.603 --> 00:49:29.530
have for a long period of
time before they die of aging.

00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:32.070
So it's fairly obvious that
this is not really the right way

00:49:32.070 --> 00:49:32.820
to think about it.

00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:34.736
We shouldn't be thinking
about these problems.

00:49:34.736 --> 00:49:37.170
We should be thinking about
this, that if we were actually

00:49:37.170 --> 00:49:38.920
to move to a
post-aging world, we

00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:42.896
would have no
age-related ill health.

00:49:42.896 --> 00:49:44.520
People's health would
not be a function

00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:46.230
of how long ago they were born.

00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:49.010
The elderly would still be
contributing wealth to society,

00:49:49.010 --> 00:49:50.980
so these therapies would
pay for themselves.

00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:53.470
The elderly would not be a
burden on their kids anymore.

00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:56.050
This is obviously something
that a lot of the elderly

00:49:56.050 --> 00:49:57.540
worry about a great deal.

00:49:57.540 --> 00:49:59.605
So that's kind of
the way I think.

00:49:59.605 --> 00:50:03.210
All right then, so the
final point, call to action.

00:50:03.210 --> 00:50:04.590
What can you guys do?

00:50:04.590 --> 00:50:07.380
As far as I'm concerned,
this is really

00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:12.402
where I want to place
emphasis because whenever

00:50:12.402 --> 00:50:14.110
I give a talk like
this, or an interview,

00:50:14.110 --> 00:50:16.276
I feel I do get people inside.

00:50:16.276 --> 00:50:18.150
I do get people to
understand that, yes, this

00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:19.900
is a really important
problem, and yes, we

00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:22.830
do have a respectable
chance to actually solve it.

00:50:22.830 --> 00:50:26.260
But I need to actually
make sure that we solve it

00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:28.620
faster than we otherwise would.

00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:31.840
And at the end of the day, it
all comes down to these things.

00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:35.480
The first thing is,
ultimately it all costs money.

00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:37.931
10 years ago, 15 years
ago, when I started out,

00:50:37.931 --> 00:50:39.180
I had three problems to solve.

00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:41.210
I need a plan for
how to solve aging,

00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:43.400
and that's what I've
been telling you today.

00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:44.180
I needed people.

00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:46.270
I needed the
world's best experts

00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:49.100
in the various
scientific areas to be

00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:51.020
enthusiastic about
working on this.

00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:53.170
And that, I have demonstrated.

00:50:53.170 --> 00:50:55.120
We already have now, very much.

00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:57.030
But, at the end of
the day, these people

00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:59.650
are still, by and large,
sitting on their hands,

00:50:59.650 --> 00:51:02.260
waiting for the resources
to actually get on with it.

00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:04.840
Because we only have perhaps
one tenth of the budget

00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:07.390
that we would need to be
able to fund everything

00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:09.160
that really needs to be funded.

00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:13.017
And that is absolutely the
number one problem right now.

00:51:13.017 --> 00:51:14.600
Obviously, I'd like
you to learn more.

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:16.650
I've only had an hour.

00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:19.330
That's not nearly enough time
to do justice to all that we do.

00:51:19.330 --> 00:51:21.913
Anyone who wants to get involved
in terms of actually learning

00:51:21.913 --> 00:51:24.359
more about it through our
educational initiative,

00:51:24.359 --> 00:51:26.400
please go and have a look
at that at the website,

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:27.900
at sens.org.

00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:30.490
But ultimately, it's
all about advocacy.

00:51:30.490 --> 00:51:31.050
Hands up.

00:51:31.050 --> 00:51:33.620
Anyone here who
doesn't know anyone

00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:36.660
who's richer than you are?

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:37.540
All right.

00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:41.396
So it's all about changing
people's minds, right?

00:51:41.396 --> 00:51:43.020
It's all about changing
people's minds.

00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:44.720
The more people we
have on-side, who

00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:46.930
understand about the
importance of this mission,

00:51:46.930 --> 00:51:49.100
the faster it's going to happen.

00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:52.890
And I spent a lot of
my time getting people

00:51:52.890 --> 00:51:54.720
to understand how
important this is.

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:57.424
If the people that I were
able to bring on-side,

00:51:57.424 --> 00:51:59.340
were to go out and bring
other people on-side,

00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:01.290
and so on and so
forth, we would solve

00:52:01.290 --> 00:52:03.320
this problem a
great deal faster.

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:05.590
I wrote this book
several years ago.

00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:07.189
It's very comprehensive.

00:52:07.189 --> 00:52:08.230
I call it semi-technical.

00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:10.060
What that basically
means is you don't

00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:12.760
have to be a trained
biologist to understand it,

00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:16.150
but you probably won't be
reading it in one sitting.

00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:19.140
It's quite dense.

00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:22.980
It doesn't cut any corners
at all on the science.

00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:24.895
And it was written
several years ago.

00:52:24.895 --> 00:52:26.270
But it's still
fairly up to date.

00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:28.080
That is not because
there has been

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:29.990
inadequate progress
in the meantime.

00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:31.460
The progress has been wonderful.

00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:35.230
But what it is is
because the progress

00:52:35.230 --> 00:52:38.290
has been pretty much the type
of progress that we predicted

00:52:38.290 --> 00:52:39.076
would happen.

00:52:39.076 --> 00:52:41.450
In other words, this is, again,
another piece of evidence

00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:43.616
that the SENS paradigm is
standing the test of time.

00:52:43.616 --> 00:52:45.752
So that's all very heartening.

00:52:45.752 --> 00:52:47.210
I think I should
also mention this.

00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:49.460
Incidentally, if any of you
are going be in California

00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:51.650
a few weeks from now--
but I guess you probably

00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:54.920
have friends who are-- and
anyone that you might want

00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:57.520
to recommend to come
to our conference,

00:52:57.520 --> 00:52:59.400
I would very much
encourage you to do that.

00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:02.540
This conference is happening
just-- maybe 10 miles south

00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:07.146
of the Googleplex,
August 21st to 23rd.

00:53:07.146 --> 00:53:08.520
And, of course,
it will cover all

00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:13.100
of the science of
what we're doing,

00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:14.680
of rejuvenation biotechnology.

00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:16.840
But also we'll have
extensive participation

00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:18.460
from industry, from
regulatory people,

00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:20.110
from policymakers, and so on.

00:53:20.110 --> 00:53:21.941
So it's going to be
quite a gathering.

00:53:21.941 --> 00:53:23.940
And, of course, lots of
laypeople there as well.

00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:26.231
And I very much encourage
you to encourage other people

00:53:26.231 --> 00:53:26.954
to do that.

00:53:26.954 --> 00:53:27.620
I'll stop there.

00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:29.995
And I think there's probably
a bit of time for questions.

00:53:29.995 --> 00:53:31.170
Thank you very much.

00:53:31.170 --> 00:53:32.640
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:36.070 --> 00:53:37.060
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:40.290
So in the field
of cancer, we see

00:53:40.290 --> 00:53:42.875
that there are some cancers
that have been very-- well, have

00:53:42.875 --> 00:53:44.460
been tackled extremely
well in the last 100 years,

00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:46.210
others that become
very resistant and very

00:53:46.210 --> 00:53:47.810
difficult to deal with.

00:53:47.810 --> 00:53:50.860
Do you see the same things
likely to happen when we tackle

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:53.164
aging more generally, in
that some diseases will be

00:53:53.164 --> 00:53:55.080
eradicated quickly and
others will take a much

00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:56.872
longer time to get rid
of, and a long tail.

00:53:56.872 --> 00:53:57.746
AUBREY DE GREY: Yeah.

00:53:57.746 --> 00:53:59.100
That's a really great question.

00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:04.580
So first of all, let me give
you my take on where cancer sits

00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:07.230
within the whole universe
of problems of aging.

00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:09.850
My view is that concept
is by far the hardest

00:54:09.850 --> 00:54:11.200
aspect of aging to fix.

00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:14.310
It's the one that has natural
selection on its side.

00:54:14.310 --> 00:54:16.650
And that makes it--
any cancer that's

00:54:16.650 --> 00:54:18.730
big enough to be
clinically relevant has

00:54:18.730 --> 00:54:22.630
a trillion different individual
engines of genetic creativity

00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:23.180
in it.

00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:25.380
It's really a
tough nut to crack.

00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:28.460
Now a lot of people, because
of largely the kind of evidence

00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:30.310
that you described,
they don't like

00:54:30.310 --> 00:54:32.290
to think of cancer as a
single disease anymore.

00:54:32.290 --> 00:54:34.206
They like to think of
it as family of diseases

00:54:34.206 --> 00:54:36.810
that we just happen to give
some collective name to.

00:54:36.810 --> 00:54:38.690
But the fact is that's
not really fair.

00:54:38.690 --> 00:54:41.330
Because there are some things
that cancers have in common.

00:54:41.330 --> 00:54:42.830
And in particular,
there's one thing

00:54:42.830 --> 00:54:46.010
that absolutely all cancers
have in common, namely

00:54:46.010 --> 00:54:48.220
the fact that they need
to figure out a way

00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:50.520
to grow the ends of
their chromosomes.

00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:52.500
Chromosomes get shorter
when a cell divides

00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:54.710
and there needs to be a
way to compensate for that.

00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:57.960
There's only two ways that
cancers ever use to do that.

00:54:57.960 --> 00:54:59.726
And we're well on
our way to being

00:54:59.726 --> 00:55:01.100
able to stop that
from happening.

00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:03.540
So that's essentially the way
that we're going about it.

00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:06.745
In general when you talk
about the relative degree

00:55:06.745 --> 00:55:10.956
of difficulty of coping
with aspects of aging,

00:55:10.956 --> 00:55:11.830
I think you're right.

00:55:11.830 --> 00:55:14.449
There are definitely things
that are harder than others.

00:55:14.449 --> 00:55:16.490
And actually, the last
part of the reason-- well,

00:55:16.490 --> 00:55:18.989
in fact, most of the reason why
SENS Research Foundation was

00:55:18.989 --> 00:55:21.480
set up, was precisely to
mitigate that problem.

00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:23.700
To ensure that we work
on the hottest things

00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:25.980
and that they don't
get left behind

00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:29.710
and we just fix the easy things
and end up where we were.

00:55:29.710 --> 00:55:32.410
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:55:32.410 --> 00:55:34.120
AUDIENCE: If you had
like a crystal ball,

00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:36.661
how long do you think it will
take until you've got something

00:55:36.661 --> 00:55:39.250
that you say actually we'll
be able to live for 100 years?

00:55:39.250 --> 00:55:39.530
AUBREY DE GREY: Yeah.

00:55:39.530 --> 00:55:40.950
You ask that question
in exactly the way

00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:42.090
that an engineer should ask it.

00:55:42.090 --> 00:55:44.040
In other words, I haven't
the slightest fucking clue

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:45.460
because it's a long way away.

00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:48.894
But, of course, you
want an estimate.

00:55:48.894 --> 00:55:51.060
And actually you're quite
right to ask the question.

00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:55.629
Because a lot of gerontologists
would just refuse to answer.

00:55:55.629 --> 00:55:57.670
They would say it's
irresponsible to get people's

00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:59.084
hopes up, or
something like that.

00:55:59.084 --> 00:56:01.000
And I say, on the contrary,
it's irresponsible

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:06.340
not to give an estimate because
however bad my estimate is

00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:08.980
going to be, yours is going
to be even worse, right?

00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:12.740
And therefore, I'm got to give
as good an estimate as I can.

00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:14.230
So my estimate is this.

00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:17.170
I think we have at
least 50/50 chance

00:56:17.170 --> 00:56:20.670
of getting the technologies
that I described today

00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:24.720
working reasonably well within
the next 20 to 25 years.

00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:25.360
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:26.276
AUBREY DE GREY: Right.

00:56:28.610 --> 00:56:30.750
And the technologies that
I describe today I think

00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:34.310
will probably give about
30 additional years

00:56:34.310 --> 00:56:35.680
of healthy life.

00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:37.770
And, of course, they
will give those years

00:56:37.770 --> 00:56:40.700
to people who are already in
middle age or older, 60, 70,

00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:43.587
or even maybe 80, at the time
that the therapies arrive.

00:56:43.587 --> 00:56:45.170
So that means most
people in this room

00:56:45.170 --> 00:56:47.430
have a relatively good
chance of benefiting.

00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:48.840
Two caveats.

00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:51.100
The first caveat,
everything I just said

00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:54.940
is only going to be true if
research in the next five

00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:58.650
or 10 years goes a lot faster
than it's currently going.

00:56:58.650 --> 00:57:00.860
The funding limitation
that exists at the moment,

00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:02.990
I estimate is
slowing things down

00:57:02.990 --> 00:57:05.070
by roughly a factor of three.

00:57:05.070 --> 00:57:08.800
In other words, over the past
10 years, the amount of progress

00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:11.540
we've made towards getting
proof of concept of these things

00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:14.200
in the lab and so on, has
probably only advanced

00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:16.670
by about three years
relative to where

00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:20.920
it could have gone if only
science had been limiting.

00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:23.290
The second caveat is
the probabilities.

00:57:23.290 --> 00:57:25.510
So I can tell you
the 50-50 estimates.

00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:28.010
But I want to tell you right
now the variance is high.

00:57:28.010 --> 00:57:30.210
I think there's at
least a 10% chance

00:57:30.210 --> 00:57:32.237
that we won't get
there for 100 years.

00:57:32.237 --> 00:57:32.820
But who cares?

00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:35.627
A 50% chance is perfectly
enough to be worth fighting for.

00:57:35.627 --> 00:57:36.252
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:57:36.252 --> 00:57:36.751
Thank you.

00:57:38.839 --> 00:57:41.380
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much
for this very interesting talk.

00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:42.310
AUBREY DE GREY: Thank you.

00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:43.810
AUDIENCE: Actually
about a year ago,

00:57:43.810 --> 00:57:46.390
we set up this company called
Calico, the California Life

00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:46.890
Company.

00:57:46.890 --> 00:57:48.515
And we set it to up
work independently.

00:57:48.515 --> 00:57:50.565
And I was just
wondering, first of all,

00:57:50.565 --> 00:57:51.940
how do you view
this development?

00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:53.140
And secondly, if you
already had the chance

00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:54.216
to work with them so far?

00:57:54.216 --> 00:57:55.090
AUBREY DE GREY: Yeah.

00:57:55.090 --> 00:57:56.890
Actually, I was very
surprised that no one

00:57:56.890 --> 00:57:59.670
at the talk I gave at
lunchtime asked about Calico.

00:57:59.670 --> 00:58:01.380
But, yes, Calico
was, as you say,

00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:05.940
set up my Larry and
Sergey about a year ago.

00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:08.296
Well, my view of
that development

00:58:08.296 --> 00:58:09.920
was expressed in
"Time" magazine, which

00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:11.980
was where the thing
was announced.

00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:14.650
"Time" got me to write the
reaction piece, so to speak.

00:58:14.650 --> 00:58:18.030
And I was pretty effusive.

00:58:18.030 --> 00:58:20.270
I was overjoyed.

00:58:20.270 --> 00:58:21.210
And I am still am.

00:58:21.210 --> 00:58:24.650
I think there is a very
respectable chance that they

00:58:24.650 --> 00:58:29.090
will make a really big
difference, but only a chance.

00:58:29.090 --> 00:58:31.030
It just remains to be seen.

00:58:31.030 --> 00:58:34.160
They are taking their
own really good time

00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:36.140
to decide exactly
where they're going

00:58:36.140 --> 00:58:38.550
to be prioritizing
their efforts.

00:58:38.550 --> 00:58:40.390
And in a way,
that's a good thing.

00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:41.980
The worst thing
that could possibly

00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:45.720
would have been a repeat of
what happened 15 years ago when

00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:47.680
another very wealthy
individual, Larry Ellison,

00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:49.388
decides to do essentially
the same thing,

00:58:49.388 --> 00:58:52.400
albeit in a foundation,
rather than a company.

00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:54.760
He basically went out
and promptly hired

00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:57.150
a veteran gerontologist
from the NIA.

00:58:57.150 --> 00:59:00.210
And the result was
completely predictable.

00:59:00.210 --> 00:59:03.900
15 years and $400 million
later, absolutely nothing

00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:07.370
had been done that wouldn't
have been done anyway.

00:59:07.370 --> 00:59:08.370
And he's given up now.

00:59:11.890 --> 00:59:13.840
So Calico is potentially
a really good thing.

00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:16.170
They've got people at the
top who are, by and large,

00:59:16.170 --> 00:59:18.154
not trained gerontologists.

00:59:18.154 --> 00:59:20.070
And therefore, they know
what they don't know.

00:59:20.070 --> 00:59:22.690
They're making
their own decisions.

00:59:22.690 --> 00:59:26.080
They're not talking to us nearly
as much as we'd like them to

00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:27.690
and as we think they should be.

00:59:27.690 --> 00:59:31.120
But that may change.

00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:32.155
So I'm hopeful.

00:59:32.155 --> 00:59:33.914
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:59:33.914 --> 00:59:34.830
AUDIENCE: Hey, Aubrey.

00:59:34.830 --> 00:59:37.180
If, as you describe,
this might become

00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:38.796
one of the biggest
industries ever--

00:59:38.796 --> 00:59:40.170
AUBREY DE GREY:
The very biggest.

00:59:40.170 --> 00:59:41.586
AUDIENCE: And if,
as you describe,

00:59:41.586 --> 00:59:43.480
you've done a great job
of convincing people

00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:45.280
that it is worthwhile
fighting for it, what

00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:48.180
are, in your opinion, the three
main obstacles to actually get

00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:50.190
the necessary
funding going, which

00:59:50.190 --> 00:59:52.545
seems to be one of the
biggest problems on the way?

00:59:52.545 --> 00:59:53.420
AUBREY DE GREY: Yeah.

00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:56.870
I will actually just stick
with one main obstacle, which

00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:58.640
is something that
I historically used

00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.140
to call the pro-aging trance.

01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:02.660
But my marketing people tell
me that that's too derogatory.

01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:04.284
So I'm not allowed
to say that anymore.

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:09.944
Essentially it's fear.

01:00:09.944 --> 01:00:11.610
It's a combination
of two types of fear.

01:00:11.610 --> 01:00:14.089
Number one, fear of the
unknown, recognition

01:00:14.089 --> 01:00:16.380
that a post-aging world would
be very, very, very, very

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:16.880
different.

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:19.220
And therefore, maybe we ought
to stick to what we know.

01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:21.050
Kind of essentially
the same as what

01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:23.860
happened to resistance to
the Industrial Revolution.

01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:26.780
And secondly, fear of
getting their hopes up.

01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:30.530
People just are not willing
to reengage this battle.

01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:33.640
People, in general, have
made the peace with aging.

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:35.217
They have accepted defeat.

01:00:35.217 --> 01:00:37.800
And when you've accepted defeat,
the last thing you want to do

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.880
is go through all
that stress again.

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:41.840
So that's basically
what it's all about.

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:44.160
People who are otherwise
perfectly well educated

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:46.647
and perfectly rational in
absolutely every other walk

01:00:46.647 --> 01:00:49.200
of life, will say
things and think things

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:51.470
that they would be embarrassed
to say to a small child

01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:54.340
to shut them up, when it comes
to this particular topic.

01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:56.050
And, of course, the
problem is that I

01:00:56.050 --> 01:00:58.430
don't get to talk to everybody.

01:00:58.430 --> 01:01:00.990
Time and time again, I will
be in the company of people

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:03.621
who are not only get
it, but say they get it.

01:01:03.621 --> 01:01:05.620
And they will tell other
people that they get it

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:06.760
and that things are good.

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:09.050
But do they actually run
me a check, not as such.

01:01:09.050 --> 01:01:10.590
Why do they not
write me a check,

01:01:10.590 --> 01:01:13.122
probably because their
wife doesn't want them to.

01:01:18.050 --> 01:01:18.840
AUDIENCE: Hi.

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:22.612
The cost of gene sequencing
has decreased kind of massively

01:01:22.612 --> 01:01:23.570
over the last 10 years.

01:01:23.570 --> 01:01:24.800
And I've seen various
depictions of people

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:26.425
saying that in five
years' time, we'll

01:01:26.425 --> 01:01:28.970
all be getting our gene
sequenced for the cost of $10,

01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:30.095
or whatever.

01:01:30.095 --> 01:01:31.720
Do you think it's a
high chance that we

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:34.430
might find genetic causes
for all these problems,

01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:37.450
like Alzheimer's,
before we find solutions

01:01:37.450 --> 01:01:38.742
that involve damage limitation?

01:01:38.742 --> 01:01:39.616
AUBREY DE GREY: Yeah.

01:01:39.616 --> 01:01:40.260
Great question.

01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:45.050
So I'm going to answer it in
a slightly complicated way

01:01:45.050 --> 01:01:47.340
with two definitions
of the word "solution."

01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:50.760
There will be the
possibility of identifying

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:54.220
genetic factors that are
responsible for the age

01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:57.240
of onset of certain
age-related conditions,

01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:59.280
whether it be Alzheimer's
or anything else.

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:02.740
And then also the possibility
of genetic conditions

01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:06.240
that are simply responsible
for it in a binary way,

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:08.010
for it happening
or not happening.

01:02:08.010 --> 01:02:10.010
So what I can tell you
is that it's very likely

01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:12.490
that we will find the former.

01:02:12.490 --> 01:02:14.610
Albeit, it's not nearly
as easy as people

01:02:14.610 --> 01:02:16.180
were thinking
maybe 20 years ago,

01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:18.375
when [INAUDIBLE] was discovered.

01:02:18.375 --> 01:02:21.090
And it looks like
it will involve

01:02:21.090 --> 01:02:23.079
a lot of different
genes combining

01:02:23.079 --> 01:02:25.120
in different people, each
individual one of which

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:27.140
only makes a small contribution.

01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:29.660
However, we can say
definitively at this point

01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:31.890
that the answer to the
latter question is no.

01:02:31.890 --> 01:02:37.550
That the aspects of
metabolism that ultimately

01:02:37.550 --> 01:02:40.050
drive the accumulation of
these various types of damage.

01:02:40.050 --> 01:02:43.030
And therefore the eventual
arrival of these pathologies,

01:02:43.030 --> 01:02:44.820
are non-negotiable.

01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:47.279
Now, the number one
worse thing that we have,

01:02:47.279 --> 01:02:49.070
that drives all these
things, is breathing.

01:02:49.070 --> 01:02:51.030
Breathing is really bad for you.

01:02:51.030 --> 01:02:54.030
But there's not a lot of
choice that we have about it.

01:02:54.030 --> 01:02:56.660
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

01:02:56.660 --> 01:02:57.307
AUDIENCE: Hi.

01:02:57.307 --> 01:02:58.890
You talked a lot
about sort of funding

01:02:58.890 --> 01:03:01.740
and where you get
it from and also

01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:04.360
bringing in the
private market narrows

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:05.710
the diversity of the research.

01:03:05.710 --> 01:03:09.120
So at what stage do you
go to the private markets

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:10.430
and the venture capitalists?

01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:11.070
AUBREY DE GREY: Yeah,
a great question.

01:03:11.070 --> 01:03:13.140
I'm not really sure about
narrowing of diversity.

01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:15.820
I mean in a sense the
continued existence

01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:17.820
of nonprofit participation
in all of this

01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:19.760
is a good protection
against that.

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:23.890
So individual
components of the range

01:03:23.890 --> 01:03:25.510
of things that need
to be done might

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:28.680
go into the private sector,
without necessarily restricting

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:33.320
the ability of other components
to continue being developed

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:35.360
in the philanthropic
sector, so to speak.

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:37.262
That's kind of how it going.

01:03:40.629 --> 01:03:41.650
I think we may be done.

01:03:41.650 --> 01:03:42.150
More?

01:03:45.970 --> 01:03:46.860
AUDIENCE: Hi.

01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:48.970
This may not be of
interest to you at all.

01:03:48.970 --> 01:03:51.720
But sticking you with your
car analogy, if you take a car

01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:53.163
and you drive it
on a smooth road,

01:03:53.163 --> 01:03:56.342
and you keep it away from Sun,
and you put in the right stuff

01:03:56.342 --> 01:03:58.550
that it needs in the engine
and what's in everything,

01:03:58.550 --> 01:04:02.320
it probably accumulates
less damage.

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:03.906
If we look at that
for a human being,

01:04:03.906 --> 01:04:06.280
in the meantime, before your
research is going to save us

01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:09.029
all, what can we be
doing to damage limit?

01:04:09.029 --> 01:04:11.320
AUBREY DE GREY: That's an
absolutely excellent question

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:14.300
and an absolutely excellent
way of expressing the question.

01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:17.660
Because you're absolutely
right, in the case

01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:21.950
of simple man-made machines like
cars, lifestyle matters a lot.

01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:25.570
You can drive a car carefully
and well and it will last a lot

01:04:25.570 --> 01:04:28.590
longer-- quite a lot
longer than if you don't.

01:04:28.590 --> 01:04:30.860
The unfortunate fact
is that it's not

01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:32.347
quite like that
for the human body.

01:04:32.347 --> 01:04:34.180
When I mentioned a
moment ago that breathing

01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:36.570
is really bad for
you, breathing and

01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:38.570
the other non-negotiable
aspects of being alive,

01:04:38.570 --> 01:04:42.017
like eating-- eating anything,
not just eating badly--

01:04:42.017 --> 01:04:48.680
are the overwhelming
majority of the drivers

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:50.177
of the accumulation of damage.

01:04:50.177 --> 01:04:52.760
Of course, there are things that
you can do that are obviously

01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:55.390
bad for you, like smoking or
getting seriously overweight,

01:04:55.390 --> 01:04:58.990
but nothing you mother
didn't tell you.

01:04:58.990 --> 01:05:01.570
If you're basically
averaging healthy,

01:05:01.570 --> 01:05:03.950
then the amount of
additional postponement

01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:06.140
of age-related ill
health that you

01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:08.450
can achieve by any kind
of lifestyle, or diet,

01:05:08.450 --> 01:05:11.260
or exercise modifications,
or whatever,

01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:15.050
is, as far as we can
tell, really tiny.

01:05:15.050 --> 01:05:16.820
And therefore,
there's only one way

01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:20.152
out of this, which is to hasten
the development of therapies

01:05:20.152 --> 01:05:21.110
that we don't yet have.

01:05:21.110 --> 01:05:23.884
In other words, give me
large amounts of money.

01:05:23.884 --> 01:05:26.195
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:26.195 --> 01:05:27.320
Thanks very much everybody.

01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:29.170
[APPLAUSE]
