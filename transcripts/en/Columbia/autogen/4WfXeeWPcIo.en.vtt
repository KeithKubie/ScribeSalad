sell so if we take we research a subject
 

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:44.940
sell so if we take we research a subject
and we take a monograph on it the

into an introductory textbook do you

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:54.190
into an introductory textbook do you
 

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:55.890
into an introductory textbook do you
consult the first-year students and

00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:55.900
consult the first-year students and
 

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:57.450

00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:31.830
make us more aware of the fact that's
 

00:51:31.830 --> 00:51:56.130
make us more aware of the fact that's
all thank you very much

and it seems to me that that what you

00:52:35.559 --> 00:52:35.569
and it seems to me that that what you
 

00:52:35.569 --> 00:52:40.690
and it seems to me that that what you
may be trying to do is create more

00:52:40.690 --> 00:52:40.700
may be trying to do is create more
 

00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:46.589
may be trying to do is create more

level already hollowed out by the
 

00:53:48.319 --> 00:53:51.789

dynamics of the of the university and I
 

00:53:51.799 --> 00:53:53.319

know I'm not telling anything you don't

00:53:53.319 --> 00:53:53.329
know I'm not telling anything you don't
 

00:53:53.329 --> 00:54:02.370
know I'm not telling anything you don't
know but but I'm I'm wondering if the

00:54:02.370 --> 00:54:02.380
 
 

00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:04.150

00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:07.630
concentration of the discourage
on the academic context when that

00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:07.640
on the academic context when that
 

00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:11.190
on the academic context when that
contact seems to have already made a bet

00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:11.200
contact seems to have already made a bet
 

00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:13.720
contact seems to have already made a bet
that that kind of knowledge is not going

00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:13.730
that that kind of knowledge is not going
 

00:54:13.730 --> 00:54:16.750
that that kind of knowledge is not going
to be part of its future is is

00:54:16.750 --> 00:54:16.760
to be part of its future is is
 

00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:20.319
to be part of its future is is
productive yeah that's a great question

00:54:20.319 --> 00:54:20.329
productive yeah that's a great question
 

00:54:20.329 --> 00:54:22.900
productive yeah that's a great question
very important question it's a big one

00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:22.910
very important question it's a big one
 

00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:26.250
very important question it's a big one
as well to try and to try and answer

00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:26.260
as well to try and to try and answer
 

00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:28.420
as well to try and to try and answer
okay I suppose the first thing to say

00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:28.430
okay I suppose the first thing to say
 

00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:31.930
okay I suppose the first thing to say
would be you mentioned manatees and an

00:54:31.930 --> 00:54:31.940
would be you mentioned manatees and an
 

00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:34.059
would be you mentioned manatees and an
oar home which people know about the

00:54:34.059 --> 00:54:34.069
oar home which people know about the
 

00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:37.299
oar home which people know about the
digital humanities I sports I in the

00:54:37.299 --> 00:54:37.309
digital humanities I sports I in the
 

00:54:37.309 --> 00:54:39.400
digital humanities I sports I in the
moment I'm working writing on the

00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:39.410
moment I'm working writing on the
 

00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:40.809
moment I'm working writing on the
digital manatees I'm trying to work out

00:54:40.809 --> 00:54:40.819
digital manatees I'm trying to work out
 

00:54:40.819 --> 00:54:42.970
digital manatees I'm trying to work out
my position in relation to the digital

00:54:42.970 --> 00:54:42.980
my position in relation to the digital
 

00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:44.829
my position in relation to the digital
humanities and the digit Maltese is not

00:54:44.829 --> 00:54:44.839
humanities and the digit Maltese is not
 

00:54:44.839 --> 00:54:48.130
humanities and the digit Maltese is not
one thing it's a whole set of fields

00:54:48.130 --> 00:54:48.140
one thing it's a whole set of fields
 

00:54:48.140 --> 00:54:49.500
one thing it's a whole set of fields
it's not even a field it's you know

00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:49.510
it's not even a field it's you know
 

00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:51.819
it's not even a field it's you know
doing lots of different things but one

00:54:51.819 --> 00:54:51.829
doing lots of different things but one
 

00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:53.799
doing lots of different things but one
of the things I'm curious about is the

00:54:53.799 --> 00:54:53.809
of the things I'm curious about is the
 

00:54:53.809 --> 00:54:56.529
of the things I'm curious about is the
tendency within a digital - to do very

00:54:56.529 --> 00:54:56.539
tendency within a digital - to do very
 

00:54:56.539 --> 00:54:58.390
tendency within a digital - to do very
much what you're talking about

00:54:58.390 --> 00:54:58.400
much what you're talking about
 

00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:00.539
much what you're talking about
so promote a very instrumental

00:55:00.539 --> 00:55:00.549
so promote a very instrumental
 

00:55:00.549 --> 00:55:03.339
so promote a very instrumental
performative kind of knowledge so you'll

00:55:03.339 --> 00:55:03.349
performative kind of knowledge so you'll
 

00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:05.470
performative kind of knowledge so you'll
get techniques and approaches from

00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:05.480
get techniques and approaches from
 

00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:08.380
get techniques and approaches from
computing science and say look we can

00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:08.390
computing science and say look we can
 

00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:10.630
computing science and say look we can
digitize the whole works of Chopin and

00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:10.640
digitize the whole works of Chopin and
 

00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:13.000
digitize the whole works of Chopin and
then we can read through it and look at

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:13.010
then we can read through it and look at
 

00:55:13.010 --> 00:55:15.490
then we can read through it and look at
the data that we can get out of that and

00:55:15.490 --> 00:55:15.500
the data that we can get out of that and
 

00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:17.140
the data that we can get out of that and
I'm kind of curious about that because

00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:17.150
I'm kind of curious about that because
 

00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:19.029
I'm kind of curious about that because
in one hand I want to be open to people

00:55:19.029 --> 00:55:19.039
in one hand I want to be open to people
 

00:55:19.039 --> 00:55:21.130
in one hand I want to be open to people
doing new things and exploring new kinds

00:55:21.130 --> 00:55:21.140
doing new things and exploring new kinds
 

00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:23.859
doing new things and exploring new kinds
of knowledge on the other hand yeah

00:55:23.859 --> 00:55:23.869
of knowledge on the other hand yeah
 

00:55:23.869 --> 00:55:25.660
of knowledge on the other hand yeah
there's a part of me that's kind of okay

00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:25.670
there's a part of me that's kind of okay
 

00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:27.730
there's a part of me that's kind of okay
so we've as we were talking before we've

00:55:27.730 --> 00:55:27.740
so we've as we were talking before we've
 

00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:29.319
so we've as we were talking before we've
digitized that we've got this theater

00:55:29.319 --> 00:55:29.329
digitized that we've got this theater
 

00:55:29.329 --> 00:55:31.690
digitized that we've got this theater
out of the saw what is that it's just

00:55:31.690 --> 00:55:31.700
out of the saw what is that it's just
 

00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:33.130
out of the saw what is that it's just
for us to be more efficient more

00:55:33.130 --> 00:55:33.140
for us to be more efficient more
 

00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:35.529
for us to be more efficient more
performative more instrumental it seems

00:55:35.529 --> 00:55:35.539
performative more instrumental it seems
 

00:55:35.539 --> 00:55:39.180
performative more instrumental it seems
that the humanities in that particular

00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:39.190
that the humanities in that particular
 

00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:41.349
that the humanities in that particular
narrow aspect of the digital humanities

00:55:41.349 --> 00:55:41.359
narrow aspect of the digital humanities
 

00:55:41.359 --> 00:55:45.849
narrow aspect of the digital humanities
is taking on very much you know the walk

00:55:45.849 --> 00:55:45.859
is taking on very much you know the walk
 

00:55:45.859 --> 00:55:47.559
is taking on very much you know the walk
taking from the sciences what the

00:55:47.559 --> 00:55:47.569
taking from the sciences what the
 

00:55:47.569 --> 00:55:49.299
taking from the sciences what the
government telling us to do or

government telling us to do or
 

00:55:49.309 --> 00:55:50.769
government telling us to do or
businesses telling us to do is like

00:55:50.769 --> 00:55:50.779
businesses telling us to do is like

search this do that so one of the things

00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:53.510
search this do that so one of the things

I'm trying to work out with a lot of my

00:55:55.390 --> 00:55:55.400
I'm trying to work out with a lot of my
 

00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:59.799
I'm trying to work out with a lot of my
project is can we think of a digital

00:55:59.799 --> 00:55:59.809
project is can we think of a digital
 

00:55:59.809 --> 00:56:02.170
project is can we think of a digital
humanities that would be different that

00:56:02.170 --> 00:56:02.180
humanities that would be different that
 

00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:03.940
humanities that would be different that
would be what we would think in the

00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:03.950
would be what we would think in the
 

00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:05.740
would be what we would think in the
humanities is more interesting than that

00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:05.750
humanities is more interesting than that
 

00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:07.960
humanities is more interesting than that
without kind of the flip side to that as

00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:07.970
without kind of the flip side to that as
 

00:56:07.970 --> 00:56:10.029
without kind of the flip side to that as
going back to we all need to read more

00:56:10.029 --> 00:56:10.039
going back to we all need to read more
 

00:56:10.039 --> 00:56:12.400
going back to we all need to read more
books in really long books and disappear

00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:12.410
books in really long books and disappear
 

00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:14.230
books in really long books and disappear
for days on end and just really study

00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:14.240
for days on end and just really study
 

00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:16.000
for days on end and just really study
because otherwise our brains are all

going to get this kind of neurological

00:56:17.109 --> 00:56:17.119
going to get this kind of neurological
 

00:56:17.119 --> 00:56:18.030
going to get this kind of neurological
turn and we

00:56:18.030 --> 00:56:18.040
turn and we
 

00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:19.920
turn and we
concentrate on anything and we've all

whatever overhead you have you've
 

01:10:44.469 --> 01:10:46.649
whatever overhead you have you've
stripped it down people are doing the

01:10:46.649 --> 01:10:46.659
stripped it down people are doing the
 

01:10:46.659 --> 01:10:50.010
stripped it down people are doing the
work for free whatever office you have

01:10:50.010 --> 01:10:50.020
work for free whatever office you have
 

01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:52.319
work for free whatever office you have
would be covered by the university and

01:10:52.319 --> 01:10:52.329
would be covered by the university and
 

01:10:52.329 --> 01:10:56.030
would be covered by the university and
then the website and you wouldn't have

01:10:56.030 --> 01:10:56.040
then the website and you wouldn't have
 

01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:58.169
then the website and you wouldn't have
presumably marketing costs because

01:10:58.169 --> 01:10:58.179
presumably marketing costs because
 

01:10:58.179 --> 01:11:00.419
presumably marketing costs because
you're doing those you're sending out

01:11:00.419 --> 01:11:00.429
you're doing those you're sending out
 

01:11:00.429 --> 01:11:02.729
you're doing those you're sending out
emails or however you're you're doing it

01:11:02.729 --> 01:11:02.739
emails or however you're you're doing it
 

01:11:02.739 --> 01:11:04.770
emails or however you're you're doing it
on the website so you're stripping down

01:11:04.770 --> 01:11:04.780
on the website so you're stripping down
 

01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:07.859
on the website so you're stripping down
a lot of costs but eventually there are

01:11:07.859 --> 01:11:07.869
a lot of costs but eventually there are
 

01:11:07.869 --> 01:11:12.020
a lot of costs but eventually there are

else so what I guess what I'm getting at
 

01:11:16.929 --> 01:11:19.140
else so what I guess what I'm getting at
is that universities have to recognize

01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:19.150
is that universities have to recognize
 

01:11:19.150 --> 01:11:22.200
is that universities have to recognize
that there are that they would have to

that was the one thing I was skeptical
about I don't think that your print

01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:32.260

these obscure research monographs you
 

01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:50.069
these obscure research monographs you
know probably you might sell 5 or 10 or

know probably you might sell 5 or 10 or
 

01:11:50.079 --> 01:11:51.629

market via the traditional publishers

01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:27.830
market via the traditional publishers
 

01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:30.610
market via the traditional publishers
for that field they can't get them to

01:19:30.610 --> 01:19:30.620
for that field they can't get them to
 

01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:32.800
for that field they can't get them to
take their books because traditional

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:32.810
take their books because traditional
 

01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:35.140
take their books because traditional
publishers are having to at least make

01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:35.150
publishers are having to at least make
 

01:19:35.150 --> 01:19:38.230
publishers are having to at least make
ends meet if not make a profit and so

01:19:38.230 --> 01:19:38.240
ends meet if not make a profit and so
 

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:39.490
ends meet if not make a profit and so
it's harder and harder for them to get

01:19:39.490 --> 01:19:39.500
it's harder and harder for them to get
 

01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:40.420
it's harder and harder for them to get
the kind of books that they want

01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:40.430
the kind of books that they want
 

01:19:40.430 --> 01:19:42.160
the kind of books that they want
published so they're coming to us as a

01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:42.170
published so they're coming to us as a
 

01:19:42.170 --> 01:19:44.230
published so they're coming to us as a
means of doing that so that's kind of

01:19:44.230 --> 01:19:44.240
means of doing that so that's kind of
 

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:46.960
means of doing that so that's kind of
one reason why people are turning to

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:46.970
one reason why people are turning to
 

01:19:46.970 --> 01:19:48.580
one reason why people are turning to
open access we were having a discussion

01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:48.590
open access we were having a discussion
 

01:19:48.590 --> 01:19:50.440
open access we were having a discussion
between us and the open humanities

01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:50.450
between us and the open humanities
 

01:19:50.450 --> 01:19:53.820
between us and the open humanities
people and there's a certain push with

01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:53.830
people and there's a certain push with
 

01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:56.380
people and there's a certain push with
certain parts of the world Pitt parts of

01:19:56.380 --> 01:19:56.390
certain parts of the world Pitt parts of
 

01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:58.330
certain parts of the world Pitt parts of
the world you know probably not the UK

01:19:58.330 --> 01:19:58.340
the world you know probably not the UK
 

01:19:58.340 --> 01:20:01.120
the world you know probably not the UK
or America but places who where they

01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:01.130
or America but places who where they
 

01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:03.670
or America but places who where they
feel a little bit on the margins so

01:20:03.670 --> 01:20:03.680
feel a little bit on the margins so
 

01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:05.920
feel a little bit on the margins so
there's a lot of open access things

01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:05.930
there's a lot of open access things
 

01:20:05.930 --> 01:20:07.720
there's a lot of open access things
happening in Australia for example and

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:07.730
happening in Australia for example and
 

01:20:07.730 --> 01:20:09.160
happening in Australia for example and
one of the things people were saying is

01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:09.170
one of the things people were saying is
 

01:20:09.170 --> 01:20:10.570
one of the things people were saying is
well maybe because they feel quite far

01:20:10.570 --> 01:20:10.580
well maybe because they feel quite far
 

01:20:10.580 --> 01:20:12.340
well maybe because they feel quite far
away and it's hard to get their things

01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:12.350
away and it's hard to get their things
 

01:20:12.350 --> 01:20:14.560
away and it's hard to get their things
distributed and out there so this is a

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:14.570
distributed and out there so this is a
 

01:20:14.570 --> 01:20:16.990
distributed and out there so this is a
really good way of doing that so there's

01:20:16.990 --> 01:20:17.000
really good way of doing that so there's
 

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.060
really good way of doing that so there's
lots of reasons why particular fields

01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:19.070
lots of reasons why particular fields
 

01:20:19.070 --> 01:20:20.620
lots of reasons why particular fields
are going for it

01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:20.630
are going for it
 

01:20:20.630 --> 01:20:25.360
are going for it
the sciences are dominated it again for

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:25.370
the sciences are dominated it again for
 

01:20:25.370 --> 01:20:26.950
the sciences are dominated it again for
various reasons because it's easy as I

01:20:26.950 --> 01:20:26.960
various reasons because it's easy as I
 

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:28.780
various reasons because it's easy as I
was saying with journal articles there's

01:20:28.780 --> 01:20:28.790
was saying with journal articles there's
 

01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:30.420
was saying with journal articles there's
also a sense where they were already

01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:30.430
also a sense where they were already
 

01:20:30.430 --> 01:20:32.590
also a sense where they were already
exchanging preprints of their work

01:20:32.590 --> 01:20:32.600
exchanging preprints of their work
 

01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:34.270
exchanging preprints of their work
because if you're in science there's a

01:20:34.270 --> 01:20:34.280
because if you're in science there's a
 

01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:37.540
because if you're in science there's a
certain importance and spirits attached

01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:37.550
certain importance and spirits attached
 

01:20:37.550 --> 01:20:39.070
certain importance and spirits attached
to being the first to discover something

01:20:39.070 --> 01:20:39.080
to being the first to discover something
 

01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:43.180
to being the first to discover something
and you know in there's a sense of if

01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:43.190
and you know in there's a sense of if
 

01:20:43.190 --> 01:20:45.340
and you know in there's a sense of if
you discover a cure for cancer it's

01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:45.350
you discover a cure for cancer it's
 

01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:46.540
you discover a cure for cancer it's
important to kind of get it out there

01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:46.550
important to kind of get it out there
 

01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:49.390
important to kind of get it out there
quite quick rather than if I produce a

really interesting reading of dollars

01:20:51.190 --> 01:20:51.200
really interesting reading of dollars
 

01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:54.700
really interesting reading of dollars
you know if it takes 18 months for that

01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:54.710
you know if it takes 18 months for that
 

01:20:54.710 --> 01:20:58.300
you know if it takes 18 months for that
to come out I think it's a great loss

01:20:58.300 --> 01:20:58.310
to come out I think it's a great loss
 

01:20:58.310 --> 01:21:00.510
to come out I think it's a great loss
but you know most of the people would

01:21:00.510 --> 01:21:00.520
but you know most of the people would

but you know most of the people would
prioritize one than the other so there's

01:21:03.130 --> 01:21:03.140
prioritize one than the other so there's
 

01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:04.150
prioritize one than the other so there's
a sense of where the sciences have

01:21:04.150 --> 01:21:04.160
a sense of where the sciences have
 

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:05.920
a sense of where the sciences have
always been much quicker to get this

already circulating it so something like

01:21:10.580 --> 01:21:10.590
already circulating it so something like
 

01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:12.350
already circulating it so something like
an open access repository like archive

01:21:12.350 --> 01:21:12.360
an open access repository like archive
 

01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:14.719
an open access repository like archive
just gonna formalize that or made that

01:21:14.719 --> 01:21:14.729
just gonna formalize that or made that

just gonna formalize that or made that
possible okay I have the question to

01:21:24.379 --> 01:21:24.389
possible okay I have the question to
 

01:21:24.389 --> 01:21:27.140
possible okay I have the question to
what extent the scholars from developing

01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:27.150
what extent the scholars from developing

countries or rising powers are involved
 

01:21:29.130 --> 01:21:31.459
countries or rising powers are involved
in this because quite obvious cost is a

01:21:31.459 --> 01:21:31.469
in this because quite obvious cost is a
 

01:21:31.469 --> 01:21:33.290
in this because quite obvious cost is a
major issue here and it would seem that

01:21:33.290 --> 01:21:33.300
major issue here and it would seem that
 

01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:36.259
major issue here and it would seem that
they should be very important actors and

01:21:36.259 --> 01:21:36.269
they should be very important actors and
 

01:21:36.269 --> 01:21:38.449
they should be very important actors and
and collaborated in this open access

01:21:38.449 --> 01:21:38.459

effort sure again there's not one

effort sure again there's not one
blanket answer to that so somebody like

01:21:46.370 --> 01:21:46.380
blanket answer to that so somebody like

because she didn't know he was a

01:21:51.169 --> 01:21:51.179
because she didn't know he was a
 

01:21:51.179 --> 01:21:53.689
because she didn't know he was a
novelist writer he was up for the Nobel

01:21:53.689 --> 01:21:53.699
novelist writer he was up for the Nobel
 

01:21:53.699 --> 01:21:54.919
novelist writer he was up for the Nobel
Prize this year we were a bit

01:21:54.919 --> 01:21:54.929
Prize this year we were a bit
 

01:21:54.929 --> 01:21:56.719
Prize this year we were a bit
disappointed they didn't get that would

01:21:56.719 --> 01:21:56.729
disappointed they didn't get that would
 

01:21:56.729 --> 01:21:58.279
disappointed they didn't get that would
been great have someone in OHP with a

01:21:58.279 --> 01:21:58.289
been great have someone in OHP with a
 

01:21:58.289 --> 01:22:03.620
been great have someone in OHP with a
Nobel Prize and so he made a decision

01:22:03.620 --> 01:22:03.630
Nobel Prize and so he made a decision
 

01:22:03.630 --> 01:22:06.229
Nobel Prize and so he made a decision
sometime core it comes from Kenya and he

01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:06.239
sometime core it comes from Kenya and he
 

01:22:06.239 --> 01:22:08.299
sometime core it comes from Kenya and he
made a decision that he wouldn't write

01:22:08.299 --> 01:22:08.309
made a decision that he wouldn't write
 

01:22:08.309 --> 01:22:11.689
made a decision that he wouldn't write
in English anymore because that's the

01:22:11.689 --> 01:22:11.699
in English anymore because that's the
 

01:22:11.699 --> 01:22:14.209
in English anymore because that's the
colonial language and he was just going

01:22:14.209 --> 01:22:14.219
colonial language and he was just going
 

01:22:14.219 --> 01:22:18.919
colonial language and he was just going
to rewrite in Kikuyu is his language and

01:22:18.919 --> 01:22:18.929
to rewrite in Kikuyu is his language and
 

01:22:18.929 --> 01:22:20.660
to rewrite in Kikuyu is his language and
so we're publishing that series with him

01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:20.670
so we're publishing that series with him
 

01:22:20.670 --> 01:22:23.540
so we're publishing that series with him
but also he's going to write in those

01:22:23.540 --> 01:22:23.550
but also he's going to write in those
 

01:22:23.550 --> 01:22:25.219
but also he's going to write in those
language and publish but it's not going

01:22:25.219 --> 01:22:25.229
language and publish but it's not going
 

01:22:25.229 --> 01:22:26.899
language and publish but it's not going
to be just from that language translated

01:22:26.899 --> 01:22:26.909
to be just from that language translated
 

01:22:26.909 --> 01:22:28.879
to be just from that language translated
into English or translated into a French

01:22:28.879 --> 01:22:28.889
into English or translated into a French
 

01:22:28.889 --> 01:22:30.799
into English or translated into a French
it would be from that language into

01:22:30.799 --> 01:22:30.809
it would be from that language into
 

01:22:30.809 --> 01:22:33.439
it would be from that language into
another language that is outside the

that court about open access it's not
 

01:22:42.539 --> 01:22:44.989
that court about open access it's not
kind of it's not this thing that
