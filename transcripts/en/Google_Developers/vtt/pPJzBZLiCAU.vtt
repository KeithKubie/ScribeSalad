I'm Timothy Jordan,
and this is your update

00:00:04.721 --> 00:00:07.140
about the coolest
developer news from Google.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.740
Make sure not to miss a
single episode by subscribing

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.990

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.830
Done?

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.020
OK, good.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.770
It's been a couple
weeks since Google I/O,

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.978
and there's a few updates
that you might have missed.

00:00:17.978 --> 00:00:19.060
Here they are.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.100
SyntaxNet, the world's
most accurate parser,

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.730
is now open source.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.350
It's a neural network framework
implemented in TensorFlow

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.300
that provides a foundation for
natural language understanding

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.420
systems.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.890
The release includes
all the code

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.980
needed to train new
models on your own data

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.250
as well as Parsey McParseface,
a parser already trained

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.780
to analyze English text.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.220
Actually, it's the most accurate
model of its kind in the world.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.540
Visit the post for more
information and the GitHub

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.600
link.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.710
Make big, unusual, and
interactive displays controlled

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.880
through a web page using the
newly open source library

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.760
AnyPixel.js.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.130
The Google Creative Lab
built it for a really cool

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.050
interactive display made from
6,000 light-up arcade buttons

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.780
acting as interactive pixels.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.830
Check out the video
and grab the code

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.180
from the post, linked below.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.210
Project Tango has a
new tutorial project

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.920
that enables you to
place virtual cats

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.170
in your augmented
reality environment.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.830
It's got a simple
interface and, well, cats.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.280
Lots and lots of cats.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.370
In Daydream Labs,
the Google VR team

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.860
is exploring the possibilities
of virtual reality

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.400
and sharing what they
learned with the world.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.540
In this recent post, they
describe one of their app

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.690
experiments, a keyboard made
out of tiny virtual drums

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.330
that works really well.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.140
Check it out.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.280
The Mobile Ads Garage
is a new series

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.280
that covers how to use the
Mobile Ads SDK to display ads

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.079
from AdMob and DoubleClick
for Publishers.

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:46.870
Check out the series
and the newest episode

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.110
now available with a
detailed explanation

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.570
of the interstitial ad
lifecycle, how to load ads,

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.140
and how to display at
just the right time.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.030
Every year, there are
trillions of searches on Google

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.260
and over half of those
searches happen on mobile.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.040
And across the
millions of websites

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.910
using Google Analytics today,
we're seeing more than half

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.020
of all web traffic now coming
from smartphones and tablets.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.900
To help marketers succeed
in this mobile-first world,

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.410
we have redesigned AdWords from
the ground up and rethought

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.300
everything from
creatives and bidding,

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.076
to workflow and measurement.

00:02:21.076 --> 00:02:22.450
Check out the post
for highlights

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.140
