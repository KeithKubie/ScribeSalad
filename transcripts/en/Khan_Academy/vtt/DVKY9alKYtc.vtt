00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.500
- [Instructor] In previous
lessons, we've talked about

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.894
how polls and surveys are used
to measure public opinion,

00:00:06.894 --> 00:00:09.110
but the important thing to recognize

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.590
is that they are estimates
of public opinion.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.220
Ideally, they're done as
scientifically as possible,

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.640
as statistically robust as
possible, but even then,

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.220
they might not give an accurate picture.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.560
And perhaps one of the most
famous recent examples of that

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.989
is the 2016 election.

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:29.462
In this chart, which I got
from Real Clear Politics,

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:32.656
you have the results of many of the polls

00:00:32.656 --> 00:00:36.350
of Monday, November 7, 2016.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.670
You might recognize that as the day before

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.600
the 2016 presidential election.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.360
And if you were to just look at this chart

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.760
from the day before the
presidential election,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.020
who would you think
would win the presidency?

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.750
As you can see, most of these polls

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.170
have Hillary Clinton having more support

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.630
among likely voters than Donald Trump,

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.710
but we know what happened on election day.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.870
Donald Trump won the election.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.387
Why did that happen?

00:01:04.387 --> 00:01:07.130
Well, there's a lot of potential theories,

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.840
and political pundits continue to debate

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.380
why this happened.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.340
One idea is that polls, when
they randomly sample people,

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.190
they're trying to randomly
sample likely voters.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.151
And some people theorize that
there might have been a group

00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:23.264
that voted in this election

00:01:23.264 --> 00:01:26.450
that the pollsters did
not view as likely voters

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.953
but they voted nonetheless,
and amongst that group,

00:01:28.953 --> 00:01:31.656
they voted disproportionately Trump.

00:01:31.656 --> 00:01:34.010
Another idea is that
maybe someone else about

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.000
the sampling techniques
wasn't completely random,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.890
that for some reason, it might have skewed

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.830
in favor of people who
leaned towards Clinton

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.740
instead of people who
leaned towards Trump.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.034
Another idea is that these
are national poll results,

00:01:48.034 --> 00:01:51.820
while we elect our president
through the electoral college.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.070
So it might be more interesting to look at

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.550
especially some of the swing
states what were happening,

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.249
but even there, it was a surprise
for most political pundits

00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:02.480
in terms of who won many of those states.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.540
So the big picture here is
is that polls and surveys

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.820
can be valuable.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.717
They can start to paint a picture of

00:02:08.717 --> 00:02:12.000
where the public's views on things are,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.870
but you should not view
them as indisputable truth.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.300
They are samples from the population,

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.300
and it is hard to do a truly
random, unbiased sample.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.627
And even when you do that,

00:02:22.627 --> 00:02:24.745
you're not even sure if
people are going to tell you

00:02:24.745 --> 00:02:26.760
who they're really going to vote for.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.420
And even if they do tell the truth

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.260
of who they're thinking for
voting for at the moment,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.093
we don't know.

00:02:32.093 --> 00:02:34.220
Maybe their minds change by the time

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.833
they actually go to vote.
