00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.740
Cheese predates written history.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.049
Ancient Egyptians loved cheese so much that
depictions of the cheese-making process were

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:12.540
painted in tombs.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.350
Homer’s Odyssey talks about how Cyclops
stored his cheese.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.720
The Greeks and Romans used cheese as a delicious
currency.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.600
During the Middle Ages, if there was cheese
on the dinner table, it meant the family was

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.710
of at least moderately wealth.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.990
(For more on all this, see: A Brief History
of Cheese) While cheese has been around for

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.240
ages, many cheeses we eat today were invented
over the last five hundred years.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.860
A few were even invented in the United States,
Monterey Jack cheese being one of them.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.560
So, how did Monterey Jack get its unique name?

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.540
Before we get into that, we must go back about
three hundred years to the Spanish monasteries

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.190
of California.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.010
In the 18th century, Spanish missionaries
began their takeover of California.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.510
It was on July 16, 1769 when the first Catholic
mission was founded at present-day San Diego.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.020
Over a sixty year period starting in 1769,
twenty one outposts were settled by Catholic

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.050
priests of the Franciscan order to spread
their beliefs among the local population.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.220
The second one established, after San Diego,
was in today’s Monterey, California.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.990
The Spanish missionaries’ very much desired
to be self-sufficient.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.500
Although they didn’t quite achieve this
(some financial support came from the “Pious

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.540
Fund of Californias” established in 1697
by Spain; later, this would become the subject

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.920
of litigation between the US and Mexico),
they brought supplies, foodstuffs, seeds,

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.820
and livestock into California never before
seen in the Americas.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.420
For example, grapes, apples, and figs were
grown for the first time in this part of the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.860
world at this time.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.030
These fruits had originated in Asia, but had
come over to Europe before this as a product

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.030
of trade.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.200
Oranges (also originally from Asia) actually
were planted for the first time in North America

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.390
in the Gulf Coast and Caribbean regions about
150 years prior (approximately in the early

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.170
17th century) , but made their first appearance
on North America’s west coast due to Spanish

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.170
missionaries.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.710
Livestock, like cattle, were also part of
the European colonization of America.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.209
Arriving in the mid-17th century from Europe,
cattle were a huge food and supply source

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.640
(e.g. leather) for the settlers.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.620
Of course, milk also came from these cows.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.980
Any fresh milk that wasn’t used was preserved
by converting it into cheese.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.470
In Monterey, the cheese they made was soft,
creamy, and light and became part of the Spanish

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.090
missionaries’ regular diet.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.540
They called it, “Queso blanco pais,” or
“the country peasant white cheese.”

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.950
Hence, the Monterey part of the name “Monterey
Jack,” with the town itself named after

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.450
the viceroy of New Spain, Gaspar de Zúñiga
Acevedo y Fonseca, the 5th Count of Monterrey.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.670
(The latter “Monterrey” ultimately derives
from the Galician “Monterrei,” essentially

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.200
meaning “mountain king.”)

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.020
But what about Jack?

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.519
Fast forward about seventy years, to 1841,
when a Scottish immigrant by the name of David

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:52.680
Jack arrived in New York.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.370
He became a storekeeper with his two brothers,
who had already been in America.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.430
It’s not clear exactly what their store
sold, but at some point they became army contractors

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.709
and hosted military personal, including one
Robert E. Lee.

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.050
Apparently unsatisfied with store life and
having heard about the great fortunes to be

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.920
made in the California Gold Rush, in 1848,
Jack made his way west.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.840
Before he left, though, he bought $1,400 (about
$37,169 today) worth of revolvers in hopes

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.920
of selling them out west to “law-abiding
and lawless alike.”

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.090
He did exactly that and made a heady profit.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.569
His gold speculating wasn’t as profitable,
though, and like so many others he moved to

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.260
San Francisco to try to make ends meet.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.350
He became a customs agent and found his way
to Monterey on a business trip.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.620
Jack fell in love with the central coast town
and officially moved there, but he struggled.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.200
In fact, he went back to Scotland for a year
when his father passed away.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.750
But he returned, determined to become a rich
member of the community.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.800
In 1821, Mexico gained their independence
from Spain after an eleven year war to earn

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.800
the right.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.890
In order to encourage expansion, the Mexican
government continued what the Spaniards had

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.030
started by issuing land grants, or ranchos,
to individuals.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.230
These individuals were allowed to settle,
farm, and use the land however they sought

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.230
fit.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.360
In 1846, only twenty five years after Mexico’s
independence, the US Army invaded the Mexican

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.870
territories of New Mexico and California and
the Mexican-American war began.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.180
This wasn’t the first time the United States
had forcibly tried to take land from Mexico.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.180
In 1845, America had “annexed” Texas.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.660
Within twenty two months, the US had won the
war and their territorial expansion to the

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.700
Pacific Coast was complete.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.750
The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo allowed at
least somewhat of a conciliatory end to the

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:39.750
war.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.710
The treaty called for several major concessions
on both sides.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.730
Mexico was to cede California, New Mexico,
and the rest of Arizona to the US, plus it

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.300
recognized the US’s claim to Texas.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:56.340
In return, the US would pay Mexico $15 million
(about $398M today), offer citizenship to

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.370
any Mexican living in those lands, and still
uphold the rancho system set up by the Mexican

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.370
government.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.960
While these promises, in theory, were kept,
the United States government found a way around

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.270
that last provision.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.870
US government-run commissions were set up
to determined who actually owned the ranchos.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.690
The rancho owners were forced to provide documentation,
deeds, and records in order to prove that

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.300
this was their land.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.580
Many could not do this due to the years that
had past since coming into ownership and the

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.980
lack of need for this type thing while Mexico
was still in charge.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:26.998
Historians believe that this was a simple
US-controlled land grab, taking land by instituting

00:05:26.998 --> 00:05:27.998
rules and regulations that were unfair to
rancho owners.

00:05:27.998 --> 00:05:29.199
This is where we go back to Mr. David Jack.

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:35.389
In 1853, with the US still sorting out all
the land grants, the pueblo of Monterey attempted

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:39.860
to make its claim that the land belonged to
the town, not the US government.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.640
They hired Delos Rodeyn Ashley as their lawyer.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.810
He would later to go on to be California’s
treasure and a Nevada Congressmen.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.310
He actually won their claim for them, but
demanded nearly a thousand dollars in fees.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.419
The town was broke and was forced to auction
off its lands anyway to pay Ashley.

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:57.620
On February 9, 1859 at 5 pm, the auction commenced.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.160
The sole bidders were Ashley and David Jack.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:05.430
They purchased every single inch of land in
Monterey that day, nearly 30,000 acres, for

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.030
$1002.50.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:12.290
Thus, Ashley got his money from the city,
and then some when he later turned over his

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.180
rights to the land to Jack.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.050
It was not hard to believe that this was some
sort of set-up.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.419
A suit concerning the auction and subsequent
purchase went all the way to the Supreme Court

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:24.320
and became known as “The Rape of Monterey.”

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.170
David Jack quickly profited on his purchase
through farming, grazing, and charging obscene

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.130
taxes on those who had built on it.

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.090
He was ruthless.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:37.000
Jack acquired even more land and immediately
began foreclosing on properties.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.080
He did this by posting foreclosure notices
on hard-to-find parts of individual properties

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.960
and in a different language- as in, if it
was a Mexican owner, the notices were in English.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.440
If they were English speaking Americans, they
were in Spanish.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.930
These lands hosted many types of business
that Jack now “owned,” including 14 different

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:59.430
dairies that were operated by Spanish and
Portuguese dairymen within the Monterey lands.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.389
When they had excess milk, they preserved
it by turning it into cheese, the special

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:06.650
“Queso blanco pais,” or “the country
peasant white cheese,” much like their missionary

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:07.650
forefathers.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:11.060
Well, since Jack co-owned these dairies, he
claimed this cheese as his own.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.789
He slapped his name on it and called it “Jack’s
Cheese.”

00:07:13.789 --> 00:07:17.300
Soon, the cheese began selling across California
and the west coast.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.539
In order to identify where it came from, people
began calling it “Monterey Jack” cheese.

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:25.160
As you can imagine, David Jack was just fine
with this.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:30.270
To this day, it’s still called Monterey
Jack cheese and derivatives, such as Colby-Jack

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:36.539
(a mixture of Colby and Monterey Jack cheese)
also exist, a homage to a ruthless, corrupt

00:07:36.539 --> 00:08:04.020
California landowner who claimed an old cheese
recipe

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.580
as his own.
