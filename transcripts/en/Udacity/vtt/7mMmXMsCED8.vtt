00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.360
All right. There are a bunch of new concepts here.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.650
Let's start with init.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.430
Init creates a repository and

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.830
doesn't directly relate to any of the other concepts currently on the map.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.370
So it seems pretty straightforward.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.430
We just want to connect it to repository.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.190
Since it does something with repository, it creates it.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.220
This is an operates on connection.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.200
There's only spot that makes sense for init, given this.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.280
The rest of these are a little bit trickier.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.140
Let's think about the staging area.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.610
You put things into the staging area before you make a commit.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.896
So it's pretty related to the concept of a commit.

00:00:29.896 --> 00:00:30.514
Git add and

00:00:30.514 --> 00:00:34.860
git status both work on the staging area to help you make the commits.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.410
Both of these are going to have operates on connections to the staging area.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.100
Status also shows you what's in your working directory, so

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.120
it'll have an operates-connection to working directories as well.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.000
So this gives us enough information to fill in all of these.
