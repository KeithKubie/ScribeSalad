what do we sound like

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240
what do we sound like
 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.110
what do we sound like
can you describe it and then the other

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120
can you describe it and then the other
 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.099
can you describe it and then the other
question I thought I can't think a

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109
question I thought I can't think a
 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.750
question I thought I can't think a
real-time chip and never left I'm

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760
real-time chip and never left I'm
 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.130
real-time chip and never left I'm
curious what you think space malleable

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140
curious what you think space malleable
 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.070
curious what you think space malleable
thank you

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080
thank you
 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.410
thank you
hi Kiki you want to know what did the

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420
hi Kiki you want to know what did the
 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.300
hi Kiki you want to know what did the
early universe sound like well this has

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310
early universe sound like well this has
 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.160
early universe sound like well this has
actually been simulated I have a friend

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170
actually been simulated I have a friend
 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.880
actually been simulated I have a friend
his name is mark whittle whi ttae if you

look up mark Whittle big bang on Google

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680
look up mark Whittle big bang on Google
 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.340
look up mark Whittle big bang on Google
you will find his webpage and it has a

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350
you will find his webpage and it has a
 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.990
you will find his webpage and it has a
recording you could listen to of the

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000
recording you could listen to of the
 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.970
recording you could listen to of the
sound of the Big Bang of course it's

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980
sound of the Big Bang of course it's
 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.860
sound of the Big Bang of course it's
accelerated quite a lot so you can

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870
accelerated quite a lot so you can
 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.889
accelerated quite a lot so you can
listen to the expanding universe in a

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899
listen to the expanding universe in a
 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.319
listen to the expanding universe in a
few seconds but it sounds like a roaring

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329
few seconds but it sounds like a roaring
 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.569
few seconds but it sounds like a roaring
noise with a pitch that diminishes

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579
noise with a pitch that diminishes
 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.970
noise with a pitch that diminishes
rapidly with time as the universe

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980
rapidly with time as the universe
 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.939
rapidly with time as the universe
expands the things go slower so you can

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949
expands the things go slower so you can
 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.950
expands the things go slower so you can
listen to a simulated Big Bang on the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960
listen to a simulated Big Bang on the
 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.290
listen to a simulated Big Bang on the
Internet it's a remarkable simulation

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300
Internet it's a remarkable simulation
 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.960
Internet it's a remarkable simulation
that he's done the other thing you

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970
that he's done the other thing you
 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.429
that he's done the other thing you
wanted to know is what does outer space

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439
wanted to know is what does outer space
 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.710
wanted to know is what does outer space
smell like was this not a question of

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720
smell like was this not a question of
 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.480
smell like was this not a question of
what does the space station smell like

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490
what does the space station smell like
 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.460
what does the space station smell like
because that of course smells like what

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470
because that of course smells like what
 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.710
because that of course smells like what
did we take with us but if you want to

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720
did we take with us but if you want to
 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.620
did we take with us but if you want to
know what is the outer space before

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630
know what is the outer space before
 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.630
know what is the outer space before
stars and planets exist I smell like

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640
stars and planets exist I smell like
 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.340
stars and planets exist I smell like
then you would want to go to different

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350
then you would want to go to different
 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.840
then you would want to go to different
places and find out what are the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850
places and find out what are the
 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.140
places and find out what are the
chemicals that are there so places like

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150
chemicals that are there so places like
 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.330
chemicals that are there so places like
the Orion Nebula which you can see with

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340
the Orion Nebula which you can see with
 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.120
the Orion Nebula which you can see with
your own eyes in the sword of Orion our

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130
your own eyes in the sword of Orion our
 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.740
your own eyes in the sword of Orion our
places where there are abundances of

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750
places where there are abundances of
 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.749
places where there are abundances of
molecules of many kinds well over a

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759
molecules of many kinds well over a
 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.340
molecules of many kinds well over a
hundred organic molecules have been

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350
hundred organic molecules have been
 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.219
hundred organic molecules have been
discovered in space and some of them you

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229
discovered in space and some of them you
 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.780
discovered in space and some of them you
would be able to smell if you had enough

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790
would be able to smell if you had enough
 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.319
would be able to smell if you had enough
of them so just imagine that that you

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329
of them so just imagine that that you
 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.270
of them so just imagine that that you
could actually compress those a

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280
could actually compress those a
 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.389
could actually compress those a
molecules from outer space into some air

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399
molecules from outer space into some air
 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.280
molecules from outer space into some air
so you could actually have a chance to

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290
so you could actually have a chance to
 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.170
so you could actually have a chance to
live and smell them you would smell

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180
live and smell them you would smell
 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.560
live and smell them you would smell
ammonia it would smell chemical

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570
ammonia it would smell chemical
 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.530
ammonia it would smell chemical
compounds like benzene like many are

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540
compounds like benzene like many are
 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.539
compounds like benzene like many are
what we call aromatic hydrocarbons I

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549
what we call aromatic hydrocarbons I
 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.280
what we call aromatic hydrocarbons I
think it would smell like a chemistry

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290
think it would smell like a chemistry
 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.289
think it would smell like a chemistry
lab there would be sulfurous ones it

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299
lab there would be sulfurous ones it
 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.570
lab there would be sulfurous ones it
would smell bad there would be some that

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580
would smell bad there would be some that
 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.880
would smell bad there would be some that
are poisonous like carbon monoxide which

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890
are poisonous like carbon monoxide which
 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.350
are poisonous like carbon monoxide which
is extremely abundant so you

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360
is extremely abundant so you
 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.840
is extremely abundant so you
wouldn't want to smell it for very long

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850
wouldn't want to smell it for very long
 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.670
wouldn't want to smell it for very long
but anyway you would smell the

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680
but anyway you would smell the
 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.740
but anyway you would smell the
constituents of interstellar chemistry

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750
constituents of interstellar chemistry
 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.620
constituents of interstellar chemistry
and there are any remarkable surprises

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630
and there are any remarkable surprises
 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.290
and there are any remarkable surprises
out there about that people imagine that

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300
out there about that people imagine that
 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.450
out there about that people imagine that
those chemicals are responsible for the

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460
those chemicals are responsible for the
 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.180
those chemicals are responsible for the
presence of carbon and the possibility

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190
presence of carbon and the possibility
 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.460
presence of carbon and the possibility
for life here on earth so it matters a

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470
for life here on earth so it matters a
 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.230
for life here on earth so it matters a
lot to us about that interstellar

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240
lot to us about that interstellar
 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.750
lot to us about that interstellar
chemistry
