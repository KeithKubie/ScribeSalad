1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,640
Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich
and this is Radiolab,

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,230
the podcast Jad Abumrad who's
normally at my side is still at home,

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,040
eking out the very end of his paternity
leave with his brand new baby.

4
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:12,990
So I've been very careful
not to disturb him,

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,600
which means though I do have to
find somebody else to fight with.

6
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:19,550
And I did manage to get into a nice
little tussle with Richard Dawkins, uh,

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,600
one of the great defenders
of Charles Darwin.

8
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:25,230
He's the Charles Simoni professor of
public understanding of science at Oxford.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,890
He also comes from a long
line of Combative Englishman,

10
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:32,640
including a guy who tried to burn down
an Ivy League college in the United

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,630
States. In fact,

12
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:37,380
why don't we begin with a
little biographical sketch
of Richard Dawkins that I

13
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,770
used to introduce him to an audience
at the 92nd street y in New York City.

14
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:44,310
And then we'll get onto the discussion.
I told them the Dawkins is Greek, Greek,

15
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:46,200
Greek. Great, great, great,
great, great, great grandfather.

16
00:00:46,201 --> 00:00:47,940
Going back to the 17 hundreds

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,230
was the major commander of the British
forces who fought George Washington here

18
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:57,120
in the American revolution. And it was
Richard Doxins Dawkins' his great, great,

19
00:00:57,121 --> 00:00:58,530
great, great, great,
great. Whatever. Sure.

20
00:00:58,531 --> 00:01:03,510
Henry Clinton who hired Benedict
Arnold to be the British spy who almost

21
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:06,930
captured west point, which is Washington
stronghold. Didn't do it though,

22
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,350
cause they cut the spies and so forth.
It was Dawkins. Great, great, great,

23
00:01:09,351 --> 00:01:09,661
great, great,

24
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:12,960
great grandfather who commanded the
British occupation forces here in New York

25
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:17,040
City in 1777 78 it was his Greek,
Greek, Greek, a Greek big man,

26
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:20,400
father who authorized rating parties
on a variety of seashore communities.

27
00:01:20,401 --> 00:01:23,730
If you live in them, please hold
your fire egg harbor in New Jersey,

28
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,210
attacked by his great, great
grandfather, new Bedford, Massachusetts,

29
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,810
a part of Martha's vineyard called
Vineyard Haven. Most insidiously,

30
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,910
he okayed and attack on new haven,

31
00:01:32,911 --> 00:01:37,860
Connecticut with the plan to burn
down Gail College. Fortunately,

32
00:01:37,861 --> 00:01:40,890
his forces as they often were,
were repulsed. Ultimately,

33
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,530
Sir Henry Clinton lost
the war and went home.

34
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,150
But sir, Henry's great, great, great,

35
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:49,890
great grand son Richard Dawkins has been
back to America over and over and over

36
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:53,700
again to do battle with more modern
Americans when he calls the most

37
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:57,630
scientifically illiterate
populace outside the third world.

38
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,240
So Richard Dawkins does not mince words.
And when we began our conversation,

39
00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:04,860
which was about evolution
in Charles Darwin,

40
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,990
he opened with a surprisingly
forceful statement.

41
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,060
As an academic scientist,

42
00:02:10,061 --> 00:02:13,840
I am a passionate Darwinian
believing that natural selection is,

43
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,150
if not the only driving
force in evolution,

44
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,920
certainly the only known force capable
of producing the illusion of purpose,

45
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:26,130
which so strikes all who
contemplate nature bopped at
the same time as I support

46
00:02:26,801 --> 00:02:28,450
Darwinism as a scientist,

47
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,900
I am a passionate anti Darwinian when
it comes to politics and how we should

48
00:02:33,941 --> 00:02:35,800
conduct our human affairs.

49
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:40,540
So He's, he's given us something of
a riddle. I mean, he loves Darwin,

50
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:44,050
but he also loads the styling.
And then for extra spice,

51
00:02:44,051 --> 00:02:46,840
he wants you to know that anybody
who thinks there's a purpose,

52
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,130
a reason why we live and look and
behave the way we do is under a terrible

53
00:02:51,131 --> 00:02:55,030
illusion. There is no purpose to our
existence. No reason why we're here.

54
00:02:55,031 --> 00:02:58,780
That's basic. Darwin, he's
has, sorry, I thought, okay,

55
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,190
I'll let's do the purpose

56
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,940
thing first. This the Darwin's theory
I think does a very good job on,

57
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:08,230
because it can tell you why something is
shaped the way it is or as the color it

58
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:10,660
is or does the function is
because, because, because,

59
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:15,010
but if you step back and you ask the
bigger question, what's it all for?

60
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:16,690
This happens involves your daughter.

61
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,470
Your daughter is driving around with
you and you're looking, she sees us.

62
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:24,880
She's six years old. She sees a, a
field of flowers. You say to her, well,

63
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:28,540
what do you think they're
for? She says, well,

64
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:33,100
to make the world pretty and to help
bees make honey for us, you think, well,

65
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,960
I was sorry to tell him
that this wasn't true.

66
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,260
And I explained to her that the
flowers are not there to make the world

67
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:41,710
beautiful and they are not there
to delight bees or anything else.

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,160
They're in the world to copy
their DNA. So a six year old.

69
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,453
Yeah.

70
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,470
But essentially what you're doing
there is furious addressing.

71
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:54,120
You're opening the eye notion to her
that the world is a purposeless in

72
00:03:54,121 --> 00:03:59,121
different machine where the meaning of
things is not clear if it exists at all.

73
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,660
You found that, I think kind of
brave to say to your daughter, look,

74
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,440
step by step into the wind
of exciting, exciting.

75
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,360
I mean it's a far more exciting view
of LAUSD to understand what they're,

76
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,040
what they're really doing
and, and a six year old,

77
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,710
she had no problem understanding
that. I explained it to her,

78
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:22,330
but,

79
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:26,930
but to come to your, what,
what's it for question it,

80
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,490
it's a piece of massive
presumption to think that the,

81
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:33,730
what is for question
deserves an answer. There's,

82
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,530
there's no reason at all why
something should have a fall about it.

83
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,780
If I said to you, what is the Sun
for? Or what is Mount Everest for,

84
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,270
you would say then because
silly it's not, it's not the,

85
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,500
it's not inappropriate question,
but because it's flowers, um, you,

86
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:54,180
you sort of feel that there ought to
be or what is it for question? No,

87
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,450
actually I think it's a harder question
than that. I think human beings,

88
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:03,990
I think most human beings have some deep
impulse to explain their being here to

89
00:05:05,561 --> 00:05:10,561
wonder about the origins of here and
the destiny of them and here and that

90
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:13,540
question,

91
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:18,420
the meaning of it all is not
a silly question. It's not,

92
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,450
that's not a silly question and it
has a perfectly good answer. Uh,

93
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,730
which is not an answer to be
couched in the language of purpose.

94
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,690
It's an answer to be couched in the
language of scientific causation.

95
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,470
What brought us all to
be here? What is the,

96
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:36,160
the explanation for our existence that
has a perfectly good scientific answer.

97
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:37,480
Uh,

98
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,620
and you go back in evolutionary time to
the origin of life and then you go back

99
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:44,440
before the origin of life
to the origin of the world,

100
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:48,900
the origin of the solar system, the
origin of the universe, and that,

101
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,820
that it becomes deeply mysterious.
Needless to say, it's not,

102
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:55,760
it's not a question I could
even begin to answer. And I,

103
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:59,030
I don't think that at the
present stage physics can either,

104
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,300
but to the extent that
there's going to be an answer,

105
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,480
it's going to come from science and that
is a deeply satisfying kind of answer

106
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:10,850
to the question, why are we here?

107
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:16,270
We already have in principle the answer
to that question and it is not an answer

108
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,660
of the form. We are here in
order to achieve some purpose.

109
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,250
It's an answer of the form we are here
because something happened which led to

110
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:28,900
something else that happened, which led
to something else that happened. Uh, um,

111
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,110
are you, uh, let me just
ask you the harder question.

112
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,820
Is this hard looking in this telling
your six year old, this leads to,

113
00:06:37,821 --> 00:06:42,020
this leads to this, this kind of reduction
is way of thinking about everything.

114
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:47,010
Does that seem to you to be less
than joyously imaginative? No, I,

115
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:51,880
I know, um, I think that's
kind of super romantic, um, to,

116
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:56,510
to actually understand that flowers, uh,

117
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,030
devices, beautiful devices,

118
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:04,060
elegant devices which are shaped precisely
to attract insects and hummingbirds,

119
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,050
uh,

120
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:11,050
and bats to take pollen
from one to another.

121
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,900
That is such a mind blowing
thought compared to the
team sort of washed out view

122
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:22,640
that flowers are just sort of
nice things to have around.

123
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,333
Um,

124
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,570
don't encourage him. So I lost that round,
at least with the New York audience.

125
00:07:31,571 --> 00:07:34,510
And I know there are a lot of you
listening who kind of agree with those New

126
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:37,840
Yorkers that, you know, this is,
this is the name of the game. If, if,

127
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,980
if you know the details of the glorious,
beautiful details, that's enough.

128
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,410
If you've been listening to
this podcast long enough,

129
00:07:44,411 --> 00:07:48,610
you know that for some of us it's
not quite enough. But anyway,

130
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,740
um, I then asked about the second
proposition. I asked him, well,

131
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:57,310
what does it mean when you say
that you're a passionate Darwinian?

132
00:07:57,311 --> 00:08:00,520
And at the same time a
passionate NT Darwinian

133
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,570
as an academic scientist,

134
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:07,630
I believe that Darwinism not only is
the true explanation for why evolution

135
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,800
happened in particular, why evolution
led to the spectacularly elegant,

136
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,693
beautiful,

137
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
complicated and apparently
designed structures that we see.

138
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,590
It's therefore a theory of immense
elegance, of immense power,

139
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,290
of immense scientific beauty.

140
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,940
But if you try to apply the lesson of
Darwinism as the social Darwinists did to

141
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,620
human society,

142
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:45,550
then you end up with a kind of
super Thatcherism you end up with,

143
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,550
or it, or even Hitler,

144
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,380
for example, he said there
are people who love die.

145
00:08:53,381 --> 00:08:55,920
When he mentioned the
science fiction writer, wells

146
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,840
wells assume that survival of the fittest
means that only the fittest and the

147
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:04,620
best creatures get to survive.
But Darwin didn't say that.

148
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:07,080
He didn't use the phrase survival
of the fittest and his book.

149
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:11,010
And he didn't ever say that evolution
is there to make better and better

150
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:15,510
creatures. As you just heard Richard
Dawkins say, evolution isn't for anything.

151
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,850
But when hg wells red dye,

152
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:22,851
when he decided Darwin was teaching us
to get rid of our less fit brothers and

153
00:09:23,101 --> 00:09:23,934
sisters,

154
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:29,030
the new republic where wells outlines
his Darwinian utopia contained some blood

155
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:33,700
chilling lines so unpleasant that I
find it hard to read them aloud perhaps.

156
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,460
I mean, it's such a striking thing
I bring myself to. It's pretty bad.

157
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:42,960
I'm sorry, I'm having trouble if
I [inaudible]. Here we are. Um,

158
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:47,280
and how will the new republic
treat the inferior races?

159
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,640
How will it deal with the
black, the Yellow Man, the Jew,

160
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:55,770
those swarms of black and brown and
dirty white and yellow people who do not

161
00:09:55,771 --> 00:09:58,680
come into the new needs
of efficiency? Well,

162
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:03,120
the world is a world and not a charitable
institution and I take it they will

163
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:08,040
have to go. And the ethical system
of these men, of the new republic,

164
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,210
the ethical system which will dominate
the world state will be shaped primarily

165
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:16,440
to favor the procreation of what is
fine and efficient and beautiful in

166
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:20,850
humanity, beautiful and strong
bodies, clear and powerful minds.

167
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,640
And the method that
nature has followed here,

168
00:10:23,641 --> 00:10:27,540
the two in the shaping of the world
whereby weakness was prevented from

169
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,910
propagating weakness is death.

170
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:35,430
The man of the new republic will have an
ideal that will make the killing worth

171
00:10:35,431 --> 00:10:36,264
the while.

172
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,800
That was hg wells in something like 1,902,

173
00:10:43,651 --> 00:10:46,530
I forget exactly when it
was published, but, um,

174
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,780
I understand this,

175
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:53,970
you mean your notion about
Auntie Darwinian is that
in our brains we have these

176
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:59,541
tendencies to make war against people
who are not like us to assign different

177
00:10:59,671 --> 00:11:04,460
roles to men and women to perhaps
favor our biological children over his

178
00:11:04,461 --> 00:11:05,310
stepchildren.

179
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:10,370
And in our brains we have the other
places where we might make war against the

180
00:11:10,621 --> 00:11:12,060
tendencies that we've
in here against that.

181
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:17,320
Um, I think that's right. I mean, you
put the dilemma rather well that, um,

182
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,760
here we do have our evolved tendencies
which have these unpleasant features and

183
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:27,861
it must be in some sense elsewhere in our
brain that we have the desire to fight

184
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,054
them.

185
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:34,740
And I think it comes after
a long period of education.

186
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:35,550
Uh,

187
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:40,550
we have moved away from the
mores of our wild ancestors and,

188
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,240
uh, thank goodness we have,

189
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,500
I'm not quite sure it's a very difficult
historical process to wonder quite how

190
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,450
that's happened, but it very clearly has,

191
00:11:51,451 --> 00:11:55,270
I mean like contraception in itself
is good enough evidence that, um,

192
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,440
that we do go against
Darwinian principles. Um,

193
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,150
so it can be done.

194
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:06,210
And the fact that most of us spend most
of our lives striving for purposes,

195
00:12:06,971 --> 00:12:11,500
striving for goals which have nothing to
do with propagating ourself as genes is

196
00:12:11,501 --> 00:12:13,870
further evidence that it can be done. So

197
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:18,600
notion then is that we are, we live
in a world carved by these forces,

198
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:23,730
but our job in part is to
recognize the good from the bed,

199
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,880
choose and fight for the good.
Well, as we understand it, this is

200
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,810
my suggestion. I mean,

201
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,240
you obviously that's a matter of
taste whether you want to do that,

202
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:36,160
but most people who live in, in civilized
society do, do want to do that. And,

203
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,100
uh, I would,

204
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:42,550
I would like to live in the sort of
society which is not run on Darwinian

205
00:12:42,551 --> 00:12:47,530
principles while fully acknowledging that
the brains and bodies that we possess

206
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,870
were put there by Darwinian
principles in the first place. Yeah.

207
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,440
You mentioned in the reading,

208
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,320
there's something about this
unique gift of foresight.

209
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:01,350
Now as I understand how how normal
evolution works is you're in a particular

210
00:13:03,521 --> 00:13:05,680
place, a specific environment.

211
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:10,090
It gets cold say and you got a few
more feathers than the other bird.

212
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,670
So you have that advantage of
having a few more feathers.

213
00:13:12,671 --> 00:13:15,430
So he should be shivers, shivers and
dies and you go out and have a baby.

214
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:19,090
Now cause I this idea,

215
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:23,170
whoever is [inaudible] it's based
in time in this moment. Yeah.

216
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:27,610
Now you said something about how human
beings have the unique gift of foresight.

217
00:13:27,611 --> 00:13:30,280
How does that, well, the, the,
the example you [inaudible]

218
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:34,060
give of the bird with the most feathers
surviving and laying the most eggs,

219
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,150
that's exactly how it would work.
And there is no foresight there,

220
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,660
but human beings can
look ahead and say, well,

221
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,430
in a few decades time it's going
to get cold as an ice age forecast.

222
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:50,670
So let's develop some new
technology that will coach.

223
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,940
We could do, Oh yes. Um, that,

224
00:13:54,941 --> 00:13:59,530
that's foresight and
foresight has literally never
happened before in the whole

225
00:13:59,531 --> 00:14:00,900
history of life. Yeah.

226
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:05,720
But if people with this foresight
decide, okay, let's breed a,

227
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,160
a set of flying horses so that we can
leave the cold places and gallop off to

228
00:14:10,161 --> 00:14:15,130
the warm places at that point. Is
Evolution as you understand it over they,

229
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,040
in other words,

230
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:21,190
does that new ingredient adding
foresight to the mix take away one of the

231
00:14:21,711 --> 00:14:25,070
essential bits of this that
somehow it happens without a plan.

232
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,250
Now there was a plan. Yeah. Um, I presume,

233
00:14:28,251 --> 00:14:31,670
I don't need to say to this sophisticated
audience that you're an example of

234
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:35,220
that making horses that flies
a hypothetical and, and um, um,

235
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:38,900
well I have a horse that flies in the
second row, but he's quiet at the moment.

236
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,360
Um, yes. Um, it,

237
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:46,430
it does suggest that theoretically in
future centuries perhaps evolution could

238
00:14:47,401 --> 00:14:52,401
take an entirely new human guided term
and you really could plan for the future

239
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:59,180
of evolution. Well, let me ask you
the tougher question. If you know,

240
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:01,160
and I know that we as a group,

241
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:06,190
as a species are capable of
creating flying horses or whatever,

242
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:10,790
does that then take us above all the
other animals and above all the other

243
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:15,140
plants and give us back our special
place that Darwin sort of made thought

244
00:15:15,141 --> 00:15:16,430
tumbled us from? Yes.

245
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,550
I think that there are lots
of big differences between
humans and other species

246
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,400
and lots of big differences between
each species and each other species,

247
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:25,160
but humans are especially
differently different.

248
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:30,670
And one of the respects in which that's
true is exactly what you've said.

249
00:15:30,771 --> 00:15:32,090
I think there are others too.

250
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,330
But the big, big,

251
00:15:33,331 --> 00:15:36,960
big difference as Professor Dawkins and
when we finished our conversation at the

252
00:15:36,961 --> 00:15:38,960
y, he and his wife, the actress Lala Ward,

253
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:44,160
kind of gave her the final
dramatic flourish. They did
a reading from his book,

254
00:15:44,161 --> 00:15:45,120
a devil's chaplain,

255
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,250
but he insists that our great advantage
as a species is we finally have the

256
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:54,270
brainpower to make our
own future for ourselves.

257
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,490
For Good Darwinian reasons.

258
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:01,730
Evolution gave us a brain whose size
increased to the point where it became

259
00:16:01,771 --> 00:16:06,240
capable of understanding its
own provenance of deploring,

260
00:16:06,241 --> 00:16:09,810
the moral implications, and
to fighting against them.

261
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:29,020
The Shark may out swim you the Cheetah
out run you the swift out fly you the

262
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:34,010
kappa, not climb you the elephant
out power you, the redwoods,

263
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,370
and speaking about gifts.

264
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,550
When it comes to
internalizing the very cosmos,

265
00:17:39,551 --> 00:17:44,260
we turn to the Alfred p Sloan Foundation
and to the National Science Foundation

266
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:47,560
and of course to the corporation
for public broadcasting.

267
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,850
I'm Robert Krulwich. Chad, we'll
be back with the very soon.

268
00:17:51,851 --> 00:17:55,330
I'm thinking you better
be so long. For now.
