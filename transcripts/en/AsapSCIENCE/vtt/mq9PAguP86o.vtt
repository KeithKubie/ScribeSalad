00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:05.259
For centuries hypnotism has been explored
as a therapeutic or entertaining tool, but

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:11.139
it has a reputation of being fake and shrouded
in mysticism. So what does science say? Is

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:12.880
hypnosis a real thing?

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.990
Take a second to close your eyes and imagine
a lemon. Imagine the smells of that lemon,

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:24.340
it’s colour, it’s shape. Picture the texture
and feel the lemon on your skin. Now take

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.099
a knife and slowly cut into it, releasing
the juices. Take the slice you just cut and

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.329
squeeze the lemon into your mouth. Now open
your eyes.

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.070
Is your mouth watering at all? You see, despite
being presented in the media as a form of

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.329
mind control, scientific researchers describe
hypnotism differently. Hypnotism is a state

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.760
of consciousness involving highly focused
attention minimizing competing thoughts and

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.170
allowing an enhanced ability to respond to
suggestions. Hypnosis, from a scientific perspective

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.579
then, is similar to the kind of focus your
brain feels when reading a book or watching

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.190
a television show, where the rest of the world
seems to “slip away”.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.000
And research has shown that it’s actually
capable of shutting down our automatic responses.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.090
Like reading words right in front of us. In
this test, try and say the name of the colour,

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.220
not what’s written on screen (TEST). So
in this case you’d say “Blue” as fast

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:29.060
as possible. Try it on your own. Kinda tricky,
right? This is known as the Stroop effect.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.710
It’s difficult because our automatic process
of wanting to read the words trips us up in

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.220
our ability to name the colour quickly. However,
if the words were in another language like

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.619
dutch, then you would have no problem naming
the colours as the word doesn’t have meaning

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.850
to you...unless you speak dutch.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.149
In one study hypnotized participants were
given the stroop test after being told that

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.070
would see the words as gibberish and meaningless.
As a result the stroop effect was temporarily

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.890
eliminated, and participants could name the
colour without error or delay. When this test

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.219
was run in an fMRI, participants showed lower
activation in the anterior cingulate cortex

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:08.649
- an area in the brain involved in resolving
conflict and competing demands; as well as

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.620
a reduction in the visual cortex, which is
crucial for recognizing words.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.760
The Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility
shows that hypnotizability follows a normal

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.610
bell curve distribution. Very few people experience
no sensation during hypnotism, many people

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.050
will respond to ideomotor-ideosensory direct
suggestions, such as lifting your arm involuntarily,

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.620
and a small group of people will respond to
cognitive suggestions which impact memory

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.569
and perception and can create hallucinations
and selective amnesia.

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.599
It’s can even be used to modulate pain.
In one study, while hypnotized, participants

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:47.750
were given a painful heat stimulus on their
right hand and rated their pain. They were

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.640
then told they would be given the same heat
stimulus, when it was actually a non painful

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.230
temperature, and they rated their level of
pain the same. In fact, their brain showed

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.400
the same level of activation in the anterior
cingulate cortex.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.269
Scientists have also scanned the brains of
people faking leg paralysis as if hypnotized,

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.050
and then again later when they were actually
hypnotized, and saw increased brain activation

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.659
in the right orbitofrontal cortex, right cerebellum,
left thalamus, and putamen. Meanwhile, when

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:19.920
faking it, they showed no such changes - which
suggests hypnosis has a different neural basis

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.269
than those imitating it.

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:27.709
So while many hypnotists or subjects could
seemingly fake hypnosis, under a brain scan

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.379
it becomes clear who is lying and who is actually
hypnotized.

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:36.310
