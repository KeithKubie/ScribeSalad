daily sustainable development conference
 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.329
daily sustainable development conference
recently only two weeks ago and

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:27.339
recently only two weeks ago and

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:39.019
are absolutely for the question is how
 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:43.829
are absolutely for the question is how
can you make systems and approaches and

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:43.839
can you make systems and approaches and
 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:48.340
can you make systems and approaches and
parts of a broader global deal where as

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350
parts of a broader global deal where as
 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.119
parts of a broader global deal where as
many parts as possible are credible

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129
many parts as possible are credible
 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.609
many parts as possible are credible
where you have accountability where they

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:54.619
where you have accountability where they
 

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:58.570
where you have accountability where they
can be measured and where countries have

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.580
can be measured and where countries have
 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.060
can be measured and where countries have
what we will call real commitments the

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070
what we will call real commitments the
 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.370
what we will call real commitments the
question is one of seeking to find ways

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380
question is one of seeking to find ways
 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.260
question is one of seeking to find ways
to overcome the big gaps between a key

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270
to overcome the big gaps between a key
 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.890
to overcome the big gaps between a key
countries on the notion and on the

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900
countries on the notion and on the
 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.770
countries on the notion and on the
interpretation of legally binding we

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780
interpretation of legally binding we
 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.920
interpretation of legally binding we
have examples of legally binding

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930
have examples of legally binding
 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.210
have examples of legally binding
agreement of a global or international

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220
agreement of a global or international
 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.450
agreement of a global or international
nature which are not followed up and we

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460
nature which are not followed up and we
 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.420
nature which are not followed up and we
have other agreements which are followed

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430
have other agreements which are followed
 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.810
have other agreements which are followed
up without them being in the strict

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820
up without them being in the strict
 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.320
up without them being in the strict
sense and you know legal sense binding

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330
sense and you know legal sense binding
 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.460
sense and you know legal sense binding
so I what we have to look for is

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470
so I what we have to look for is
 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.210
so I what we have to look for is
sufficient credibility consensus

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220
sufficient credibility consensus
 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:52.020
sufficient credibility consensus

building they inspire leaders so not

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530
building they inspire leaders so not
 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.040

think it in itself will be enough unless

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190
think it in itself will be enough unless
 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.420
think it in itself will be enough unless
we have leaders committing and

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430
we have leaders committing and
 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.280
