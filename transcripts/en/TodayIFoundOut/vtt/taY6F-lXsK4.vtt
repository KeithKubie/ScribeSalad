00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:16.020
In the world of physics the name F.D.C. Willard
is simultaneously treated with both reverence

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.820
and derision. On one hand, he co-authored
an often cited paper on low temperature physics

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.369
at age 7 and was the sole author of another
entire paper on the subject in French just

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.950
a few years later at age 12. On the other
hand, he was also a cat.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.680
The story of Willard’s foray into the world
of low temperature physics began in 1975 when

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.010
his eventual co-author, Professor Jack H.
Hetherington, asked a colleague at Michigan

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.480
State University to read over a paper he’d
written, Two-, Three-, and Four-Atom Exchange

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.920
Effects in bcc 3He.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.609
After reading over the paper, Hetherington’s
colleague came back with some unfortunate

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:55.829
news- while the content of the paper itself
was sound, Hetherington had made a rather

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.460
silly mistake. You see, throughout the paper,
he had often referred to himself using the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.670
words “we” and “our”. Normally this
wouldn’t have been a big deal; however,

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.159
the journal Hetherington was submitting the
paper to, Physical Review Letters, had a general

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.250
rule in place that stated papers with a singular
author shouldn’t use the first person plural.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.030
Being the 1970s, Hetherington had typed up
the entire paper using a typewriter, so fixing

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.891
this mistake would have taken him more time
than he was willing to invest in it. Being

00:01:22.891 --> 00:01:27.530
someone with a PhD in physics, Hetherington
was no dummy and came up with an easy solution-

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.140
he decided to make his pet Siamese cat, Chester,
a co-author.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.689
Wanting to give his furry friend a little
more credibility, Hetherington stylised Chester’s

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.420
name as “Felis Domesticus Chester, sired
by Willard” which was shortened to “F.D.C.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.420
Willard”.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.189
Hetherington’s ruse worked and a few months
later on the 24th of November in the 35th

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.670
edition of Physical Review Letters, they published
“Two-, Three-, and Four-Atom Exchange Effects

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.119
in bcc 3He” co-authored by one J. H. Hetherington
and his colleague, F. D. C. Willard.

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.179
The fact that the mysterious F.D.C. Willard
was actually just a cat was first revealed

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:06.259
publicly when, according to Hetherington,
“a visitor to [the university] asked to

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.789
talk to me, and since I was unavailable asked
to talk with Willard. Everyone laughed and

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.490
soon the cat was out of the bag.”

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:13.490
pawprints
F.D.C. Willard’s “Signature”

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.680
It was made more widely known when Hetherington
was sent several copies of the paper to sign

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.310
and he decided to double down on his ploy
by daubing Chester’s paw in ink and slapping

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.180
it on the page. One of these copies ended
up being sent to physicists in Grenoble who

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.170
were planning on inviting Professor Willard
to the “15th International Conference on

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.980
Low Temperature Physics” in 1978. However,
upon seeing the inky paw print on the page

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.590
and realising that Willard must be a cat,
the group making up the list of who to invite

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.920
decided that neither Willard nor Hetherington
should be included on their roster that year.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.480
Even more controversy followed when it emerged
that Hetherington’s wife was sharing a bed

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.280
not only with her husband, but F.D.C. Willard
as well, sometimes at the same time…

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.590
Despite the public relations problem, F.D.C.
Willard continued his work in academia, helping

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.790
out his colleagues by being present in numerous
debates about low energy physics with his

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.390
input being described as “helpful” by
his co-workers in private and official correspondence.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.240
Willard’s contributions to science didn’t
go overlooked by his peers in other areas

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.210
either. For example, in Organic Chemistry:
The Name Game, Willard was mentioned; they

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.300
stated: “Although [his] future in physics
is uncertain, we like his style and hope he

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.300
gets tenure.”

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.160
And, in fact, on November 26, 1975, the chairmen
of the physics department at Michigan State

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.420
University, Dr. Truman O. Woodruff, wrote
a letter to Hetherington stating,

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.280
I should never have had the temerity to think
of approaching so distinguished a physicist

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.330
as F.D. C. Willard, F.R.S.C., with a view
to interesting him in joining a university

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.400
department like ours, which after all, was
not even rated among the best 30 in the 1969

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.180
Roose-Anderson study. Surely Willard can aspire
to a connection with a more distinguished

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.180
department.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.570
However, heartened by your view that he might
conceivably deign to look with favor on the

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.440
modest opportunity that we have to offer,
I do beseech you– his friend and even collaborator–

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.640
at the most propitious possible time (say,
some evening when the brandy and cigars are

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.420
going around) to raise the question with him
(with all possible delicacy, I need hardly

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.130
add). Can you imagine the universal jubilation
if in fact Willard could be persuaded to join

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.040
us, even if only as a Visiting Distinguished
Professor?

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.910
Given there are no records of F.D.C. Willard
on the university’s payroll, we can only

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.419
assume he turned up his nose and walked away
from such a delectable opportunity, as cats

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:27.200
are wont to do. That said, Hetherington did
refer to Willard as the university’s “Rodentia

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.690
Predation Consultant”. On top of this, Willard
was often cited as being instrumental to a

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.890
number of “departmental experiments related
to angular momentum and gravitational forces”

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.650
by Hetherington’s peers in Michigan.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.410
This wasn’t the end of his academic career,
though. In 1980, Willard dusted off his pen

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.180
and effortlessly authored the paper, “L’hélium
3 solid. Un antiferromagnétique Nucléaire”

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.703
entirely in French for the magazine, “La
Recherche”.

00:04:45.703 --> 00:04:49.330
In reality, the paper had been written by
a collective of researchers from France and

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.660
America, including Hetherington, who couldn’t
agree on certain elements of its content.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.360
When no satisfactory compromise could be reached
between the members of the group, Hetherington

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.070
suggested they make F.D.C. Willard the sole
author so that if anyone found fault with

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.040
it, none of their names would be sullied.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.210
Sadly, F.D.C. Willard passed away in 1982
at approximately 14 years old, but his legacy

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.420
lived on in the world of science thanks to
the fact that the paper he co-authored actually

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.389
ended up being fairly influential and often
cited for its scientific merits.

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:22.600
When later asked why he made his cat a co-author
on the paper, beyond the aforementioned need

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.660
of not wanting to take the time to fix the
instances of the royal “we”, Hetherington

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.530
explained that “most of us are paid partly
by how many papers we publish, and there is

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.190
some dilution of the effect of the paper on
one’s reputation when it is shared by another

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.560
author. On the other hand, I did not ignore
completely the publicity value, either. If

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.960
[the paper] eventually proved to be correct,
people would remember [it] more if the anomalous

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.940
authorship were known. In any case, I went
ahead and did it and have generally not been

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.139
sorry. Most people are amused by the concept,
only editors, for some reason, seem to find

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:55.000
little humour in the story.”

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.980
In the end, to honor F.D.C. Willard’s role
in helping to break down the barriers keeping

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:03.420
felines out of human science careers, the
American Physical Society announced on April

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:08.990
1, 2014 that all papers authored by cats would
be made “freely available” for the public

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.840
to read henceforth. They also added that “Not
since Schrödinger has there been an opportunity

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:44.740
like this for cats 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.930
in physics.”
