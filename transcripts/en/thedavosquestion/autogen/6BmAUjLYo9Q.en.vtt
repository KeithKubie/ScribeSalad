00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.220
so the world is facing unprecedented

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:03.230
so the world is facing unprecedented
 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.590
so the world is facing unprecedented
problems we have a short-term crisis

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600
problems we have a short-term crisis
 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.950
problems we have a short-term crisis
which is an economic crisis of

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960
which is an economic crisis of
 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.410
which is an economic crisis of
substantial proportions and we have a

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420
substantial proportions and we have a
 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.530
substantial proportions and we have a
long-term fiscal problem the world is

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540
long-term fiscal problem the world is
 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.560
long-term fiscal problem the world is
facing which is that governments have a

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570
facing which is that governments have a
 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.420
facing which is that governments have a
tremendous burden of debt and the

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430
tremendous burden of debt and the
 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.150
tremendous burden of debt and the
question is what can we do about this

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160
question is what can we do about this
 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.429
question is what can we do about this
and so when we think about the short

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439
and so when we think about the short
 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.140
and so when we think about the short
term we need to be thinking about

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150
term we need to be thinking about
 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.570
term we need to be thinking about
creating jobs and in the long term we

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580
creating jobs and in the long term we
 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.429
creating jobs and in the long term we
need to think about addressing one of

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439
need to think about addressing one of
 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.880
need to think about addressing one of
the key issues for progress fiscal

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890
the key issues for progress fiscal
 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.389
the key issues for progress fiscal
problems which is low health and paying

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399
problems which is low health and paying
 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.660
problems which is low health and paying
for health care and improving the health

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670
for health care and improving the health
 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.470
for health care and improving the health
of our older populations and our our

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480
of our older populations and our our
 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.860
of our older populations and our our
council is working on genetic solutions

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870
council is working on genetic solutions
 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.650
council is working on genetic solutions
to this problem and what that means is

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660
to this problem and what that means is
 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.770
to this problem and what that means is
that if we can invest now we can create

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780
that if we can invest now we can create
 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.979
that if we can invest now we can create
opportunities for innovation in this

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989
opportunities for innovation in this
 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.650
opportunities for innovation in this
field and the promises that if we do it

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660
field and the promises that if we do it
 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.600
field and the promises that if we do it
right we'll be able to create a happier

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610
right we'll be able to create a happier
 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.990
right we'll be able to create a happier
healthier society and actually turns out

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000
healthier society and actually turns out
 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.030
healthier society and actually turns out
that when you do that it actually ends

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040
that when you do that it actually ends
 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.969
that when you do that it actually ends
up costing less money so if we're able

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979
up costing less money so if we're able
 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.359
up costing less money so if we're able
to achieve our ends and develop the new

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369
to achieve our ends and develop the new
 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.390
to achieve our ends and develop the new
model that we're looking for then we can

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400
model that we're looking for then we can
 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.310
model that we're looking for then we can
help contribute to solving both of these

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320
help contribute to solving both of these
 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.610
help contribute to solving both of these
problems simultaneous
