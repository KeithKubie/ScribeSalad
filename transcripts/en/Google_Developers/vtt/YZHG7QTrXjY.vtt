00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.540
RUPERT WHITEHEAD:
What we have today

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.545
is a ton of different agencies
here all focusing on mobile,

00:00:09.545 --> 00:00:11.711
and they're here to learn
from one another as well

00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:13.460
as the experts that
we've got in the room.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.875
So you'll see that we cover
a wide range of topics.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.840
WM LELER: We are looking
for agencies to build apps

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:21.890
with our new product.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.440
One-on-one conversations
with people work really well.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.150
If that's all we
had done all day,

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.892
that would have been
worth the whole day.

00:00:27.892 --> 00:00:29.600
RUPERT WHITEHEAD: We
need to get agencies

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.650
learning from one another.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.390
And so what we've done
here is split them

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.360
out into lots of different
groups, CXOs and founders

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.476
in one corner talking
about the kind of issues

00:00:37.476 --> 00:00:38.600
that are important to them.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.030
We've also got developers
in another corner talking

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.610
about the issues that are most
important to them as well.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.651
MARK THOMAS: It was kind
of like group mentoring.

00:00:45.651 --> 00:00:47.720
It was interesting to
get different opinions,

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.990
similar problems.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.580
I look to follow the
discussions after this event.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.620
STEFAN GERSTMEIER: To
liase with other agencies,

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.340
to learn from their experience,
having access to the Google

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.285
experts here like the UX
Review, helps us a lot.

00:01:01.285 --> 00:01:02.660
PRAMADA SAHU: I'm
looking forward

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.060
to interact with
people, to network,

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.152
to understand how we can become
a certified Google agency.

00:01:08.152 --> 00:01:09.860
ALEX CARNESSA: I like
this approach where

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.710
the coffee break has more time.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.150
First, because I'm Italian
and I love coffee, second,

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.338
because I really like this part
of the program where agencies

00:01:17.338 --> 00:01:18.004
meet each other.

00:01:18.004 --> 00:01:20.290
So I'm looking forward to
meet other people, actually.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.206
ROSALIE HARAN: We talked
about different tools

00:01:22.206 --> 00:01:23.870
that we're using,
challenges of working

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.496
with remote teams
who might be getting

00:01:25.496 --> 00:01:26.754
a little fatigued and bored.

00:01:26.754 --> 00:01:28.170
ANTHONY GALVIN:
When we do well is

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.537
when we do something
that's new and exciting,

00:01:30.537 --> 00:01:32.120
and working with a
company like Google

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.620
gives us loads of opportunity
to do new, interesting things.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.036
RUPERT WHITEHEAD:
It's really nice

00:01:36.036 --> 00:01:37.550
to see people who
would otherwise

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.730
be competing with one
another sitting down together

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.560
and learning from one another.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.960
When agencies partner
together and learn together,

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.840
they have so much more
that they can gain than

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.907
by going it alone.

00:01:48.907 --> 00:01:50.740
WM LELER: Can you tell
I'm happy about this?

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.190
You know, it's like [LAUGHS]
