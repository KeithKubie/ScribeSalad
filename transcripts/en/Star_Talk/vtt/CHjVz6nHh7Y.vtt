00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.406
- Welcome to StarTalk here at Bam.

00:00:02.406 --> 00:00:04.656
(cheering)

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:14.920
Yes, it is now my incredibly
great pleasure to bring on,

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.909
your host, a wonderful man,

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:17.989
a hero to science.

00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:19.288
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:19.288 --> 00:00:21.486
Neil Degrasse Tyson.

00:00:21.486 --> 00:00:23.736
(cheering)

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:44.480
As promised.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.737
(laughing)

00:00:45.737 --> 00:00:47.068
There's Neil.

00:00:47.068 --> 00:00:51.006
I will now bring on our
two comedic guests tonight.

00:00:51.006 --> 00:00:53.128
Ladies and gentlemen Michael Ian Black.

00:00:53.128 --> 00:00:55.824
(cheering)

00:00:55.824 --> 00:00:56.657
- Hello.

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:58.888
Thank you Gene.

00:00:58.888 --> 00:01:00.221
- Hello Michael.

00:01:02.818 --> 00:01:04.469
And the always delightful,

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:05.849
Paul Rudd.

00:01:05.849 --> 00:01:08.069
(cheering)

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:10.319
(laughing)

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.483
Welcome Paul.

00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:25.879
- Just to remind you--

00:01:25.879 --> 00:01:27.371
- So handsome.

00:01:27.371 --> 00:01:30.152
(laughing)

00:01:30.152 --> 00:01:33.148
- Remind you of what StarTalk is,

00:01:33.148 --> 00:01:33.981
it is a,

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.496
(laughing)
- Paul Rudd fuck fest.

00:01:37.496 --> 00:01:40.368
- Whoo!
(laughing)

00:01:40.368 --> 00:01:42.139
- [Eugene] Set that wrong.

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:45.076
- We like to have fun with science.

00:01:45.076 --> 00:01:48.499
And we always have comedic
co-hosts and we go live.

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:49.939
We have more than one.

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:51.272
And now for our,

00:01:53.355 --> 00:01:55.968
science, this is the science
side of the house right here.

00:01:55.968 --> 00:01:57.528
(laughing)

00:01:57.528 --> 00:01:58.361
- Sorry.

00:02:02.656 --> 00:02:03.575
- First let me introduce,

00:02:03.575 --> 00:02:05.397
this is her second time,

00:02:05.397 --> 00:02:07.824
as a guest on StarTalk Live.

00:02:07.824 --> 00:02:11.136
She's a professor of
cognitive neuroscience

00:02:11.136 --> 00:02:13.219
at Columbia Presbyterian.

00:02:15.637 --> 00:02:17.056
Heather Berlin, come on Heather.

00:02:17.056 --> 00:02:19.026
(cheering)

00:02:19.026 --> 00:02:21.276
(clapping)

00:02:31.168 --> 00:02:32.877
I stumbled, not 'cause I
didn't remember her name,

00:02:32.877 --> 00:02:35.067
but in fact it's Mount
Cyanide Medical Center,

00:02:35.067 --> 00:02:36.488
not Columbia so,

00:02:36.488 --> 00:02:38.147
my apologies there.

00:02:38.147 --> 00:02:39.928
It's your second time, thank you.

00:02:39.928 --> 00:02:40.848
This is a neuroscience show.

00:02:40.848 --> 00:02:42.408
We have one more guest.

00:02:42.408 --> 00:02:43.241
And she's,

00:02:45.157 --> 00:02:47.928
I'm a big fan of hers in many ways.

00:02:47.928 --> 00:02:51.096
You've seen her on
television, know of her.

00:02:51.096 --> 00:02:52.406
Please welcome,

00:02:52.406 --> 00:02:54.637
warm Brooklyn welcome,

00:02:54.637 --> 00:02:57.157
to Mayim Bialik from The Big Band Theory.

00:02:57.157 --> 00:03:01.657
(cheering)
(clapping)

00:03:12.796 --> 00:03:14.247
- This is a hell of a lineup.

00:03:14.247 --> 00:03:15.927
(laughing)

00:03:15.927 --> 00:03:16.877
I'm just saying what they're thinking.

00:03:16.877 --> 00:03:18.336
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:18.336 --> 00:03:21.136
So we're gonna talk about the brain,

00:03:21.136 --> 00:03:23.427
the whole next 90 minutes,

00:03:23.427 --> 00:03:24.528
three segments,

00:03:24.528 --> 00:03:25.816
we're gonna talk about the brain.

00:03:25.816 --> 00:03:28.316
And you're here because Mayim,

00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:31.976
you have a PhD in Neuroscience.

00:03:31.976 --> 00:03:35.227
You don't only portray
one who does on T.V.

00:03:35.227 --> 00:03:36.477
You actually have one, right.

00:03:36.477 --> 00:03:38.816
- Yes I'm a doctor and I play one on T.V.

00:03:38.816 --> 00:03:40.848
(laughing)
- You do both.

00:03:40.848 --> 00:03:41.807
You do both.

00:03:41.807 --> 00:03:44.638
And so, you also have a new
book that just came out,

00:03:44.638 --> 00:03:46.108
on being a vegan.

00:03:46.108 --> 00:03:46.941
- Correct.

00:03:46.941 --> 00:03:48.219
(cheering)

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:49.800
- We have 12 vegans in the audience.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.633
- Hey we're in Brooklyn.

00:03:50.633 --> 00:03:51.466
There's plenty.

00:03:51.466 --> 00:03:53.429
(laughing)

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:54.617
- And I try to say,

00:03:54.617 --> 00:03:55.450
how do like,

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.730
how weed veganism into StarTalk.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:58.563
And,

00:03:58.563 --> 00:04:01.598
(laughing)

00:04:01.598 --> 00:04:02.800
- By just discussing it.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.619
(laughing)

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:06.960
- So and I noticed,

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.799
that the United States actually has plans,

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.381
unfunded though they are plans to,

00:04:12.381 --> 00:04:14.221
go to Mars by 2030.

00:04:14.221 --> 00:04:15.054
And if you're on Mars,

00:04:15.054 --> 00:04:16.901
there are not gonna be
bringing cows with them.

00:04:16.901 --> 00:04:17.941
- You just found the perfect way,

00:04:17.941 --> 00:04:19.327
to incorporate it into this evening.

00:04:19.327 --> 00:04:20.337
(laughing)

00:04:20.337 --> 00:04:23.189
- And so in fact, they're
developing vegan recipes,

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:24.096
to go to Mars.

00:04:24.096 --> 00:04:25.676
Because the first colonists there,

00:04:25.676 --> 00:04:28.458
they want to be able to
eat sort of efficiently,

00:04:28.458 --> 00:04:29.557
as it were.

00:04:29.557 --> 00:04:31.157
- Not damage the environment of Mars.

00:04:31.157 --> 00:04:34.138
(laughing)

00:04:34.138 --> 00:04:35.927
- But don't we need to damage
the environment of Mars,

00:04:35.927 --> 00:04:37.589
to make Mars habitable.

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:38.789
(laughing)

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:39.858
Isn't that the entire point.

00:04:39.858 --> 00:04:41.247
- Mars is just one cow away

00:04:41.247 --> 00:04:42.687
from being a place people could live.

00:04:42.687 --> 00:04:45.007
(laughing)

00:04:45.007 --> 00:04:46.069
- Wait, wait and so it's an interesting,

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:47.447
what does damage mean?

00:04:47.447 --> 00:04:49.157
If you change what it is,

00:04:49.157 --> 00:04:50.607
that's damaging it technically.

00:04:50.607 --> 00:04:52.156
If you turn Mars into Earth,

00:04:52.156 --> 00:04:54.287
you totally messed with it right?

00:04:54.287 --> 00:04:57.178
So I don't know if that's a
good thing or a bad thing.

00:04:57.178 --> 00:04:59.647
- But was Mars actually
like Earth at one point?

00:04:59.647 --> 00:05:00.837
- We don't know,

00:05:00.837 --> 00:05:03.098
but we have evidence that
it had running water.

00:05:03.098 --> 00:05:03.931
- Right.

00:05:03.931 --> 00:05:06.669
- So something bad
happened on Mars long ago.

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:07.502
And so,

00:05:07.502 --> 00:05:08.335
- George Bush.

00:05:08.335 --> 00:05:10.585
(laughing)

00:05:12.293 --> 00:05:13.126
It's just a theory.

00:05:13.126 --> 00:05:15.376
(laughing)

00:05:17.423 --> 00:05:20.506
- So are you a candidate for NASA to,

00:05:21.485 --> 00:05:23.885
retain as an advisor in this capacity?

00:05:23.885 --> 00:05:25.285
- No.
(laughing)

00:05:25.285 --> 00:05:27.145
- Why, you just wrote a book on veganism.

00:05:27.145 --> 00:05:29.165
- No I wrote a book on the vegan things,

00:05:29.165 --> 00:05:31.565
that I feed non vegans that they enjoyed.

00:05:31.565 --> 00:05:33.314
It has nothing to do with Mars,

00:05:33.314 --> 00:05:34.620
or space.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.844
I should be on that side of the room,

00:05:36.844 --> 00:05:38.125
to talk about it.

00:05:38.125 --> 00:05:38.994
Not this side.

00:05:38.994 --> 00:05:40.834
- Okay so it's tasty vegan food,

00:05:40.834 --> 00:05:42.346
for the skeptic I guess.

00:05:42.346 --> 00:05:44.154
- Sure, I mean,

00:05:44.154 --> 00:05:46.146
I write for a website called Kveller.

00:05:46.146 --> 00:05:47.455
And I would often write about,

00:05:47.455 --> 00:05:48.934
recipes that I had made vegan,

00:05:48.934 --> 00:05:49.912
just kind of in passing.

00:05:49.912 --> 00:05:52.242
And people wanted me to publish them.

00:05:52.242 --> 00:05:53.975
I'm not like a fancy celebrity chef.

00:05:53.975 --> 00:05:55.575
I never look like this.

00:05:55.575 --> 00:05:57.234
I usually am in sweats and an apron,

00:05:57.234 --> 00:05:58.997
in my kitchen.

00:05:58.997 --> 00:06:01.546
So I wasn't looking to be a
celebrity chef and say like,

00:06:01.546 --> 00:06:02.626
this is how you should eat.

00:06:02.626 --> 00:06:04.335
It will make your family perfect.

00:06:04.335 --> 00:06:05.615
But what I know is what,

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:07.295
I've sort of cooked my whole life,

00:06:07.295 --> 00:06:09.495
and things that I've made
vegan that taste good.

00:06:09.495 --> 00:06:11.226
This still has nothing to do with science.

00:06:11.226 --> 00:06:12.226
But I'll be done talking soon.

00:06:12.226 --> 00:06:13.247
(laughing)

00:06:13.247 --> 00:06:14.207
- Well it does have to do with it,

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:15.664
because being a vegan means you're eating,

00:06:15.664 --> 00:06:18.331
efficiently given the ecosystem.

00:06:19.647 --> 00:06:20.480
That matters.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.313
- Right.

00:06:21.313 --> 00:06:22.258
So one of the reasons that some people,

00:06:22.258 --> 00:06:23.466
do choose to eat vegan,

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:25.745
is out of sort of deference to the planet,

00:06:25.745 --> 00:06:28.218
and environmental concerns.

00:06:28.218 --> 00:06:31.277
It shouldn't cost more to store food,

00:06:31.277 --> 00:06:33.015
than it does to actually
give it to people.

00:06:33.015 --> 00:06:34.505
And sometimes that happens.

00:06:34.505 --> 00:06:35.975
- Yeah and so I'm just saying,

00:06:35.975 --> 00:06:38.655
if you make food that non
vegan people are happy with,

00:06:38.655 --> 00:06:40.426
that makes you a really valuable person.

00:06:40.426 --> 00:06:41.259
- Why thank you.

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:42.644
(laughing)

00:06:42.644 --> 00:06:44.885
Am I the most valuable person?

00:06:44.885 --> 00:06:45.718
- I don't know.

00:06:45.718 --> 00:06:47.095
I just wanted to call
that to your attention.

00:06:47.095 --> 00:06:49.826
Because NASA has an advanced technology,

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:51.786
advanced food technology project.

00:06:51.786 --> 00:06:52.796
- Should I be holding this like you are?

00:06:52.796 --> 00:06:53.629
- Oh no you don't have to.

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:55.005
- Everyone's holding one but me.

00:06:55.005 --> 00:06:56.282
Okay I'll hold it.

00:06:56.282 --> 00:06:57.946
- Speaking of someone
with a perfect family,

00:06:57.946 --> 00:06:59.317
I have a question about veganism.

00:06:59.317 --> 00:07:01.567
(laughing)

00:07:02.445 --> 00:07:05.035
Is apple wood bacon, is that vegan?

00:07:05.035 --> 00:07:07.285
(laughing)

00:07:08.237 --> 00:07:09.655
- It's got the word apple in it.

00:07:09.655 --> 00:07:10.893
It must be healthy.

00:07:10.893 --> 00:07:12.586
- Okay good.

00:07:12.586 --> 00:07:14.235
- I was just thinking of your book,

00:07:14.235 --> 00:07:16.015
Pesto Pasta for Martians.

00:07:16.015 --> 00:07:16.848
- Yes.

00:07:16.848 --> 00:07:17.681
(laughing)

00:07:17.681 --> 00:07:18.765
- That was what you were working on right.

00:07:18.765 --> 00:07:20.245
(laughing)

00:07:20.245 --> 00:07:22.603
I really think that you should
jump in on this conversation.

00:07:22.603 --> 00:07:24.411
(laughing)

00:07:24.411 --> 00:07:25.845
- So if you go to Mars,

00:07:25.845 --> 00:07:28.112
it takes six to nine months to get there,

00:07:28.112 --> 00:07:29.293
and then you have to wait for,

00:07:29.293 --> 00:07:30.874
the planets to realign.

00:07:30.874 --> 00:07:33.063
- By then you can digest
the meat you ate last night.

00:07:33.063 --> 00:07:34.902
(laughing)

00:07:34.902 --> 00:07:35.735
Sorry.

00:07:35.735 --> 00:07:38.623
(laughing)

00:07:38.623 --> 00:07:39.456
Sorry.

00:07:39.456 --> 00:07:42.095
(laughing)

00:07:42.095 --> 00:07:42.928
- I just want to point out,

00:07:42.928 --> 00:07:46.666
that most people are more omnivores,

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:47.594
and don't just.

00:07:47.594 --> 00:07:49.383
Like nobody just, anyway go on.

00:07:49.383 --> 00:07:51.633
(laughing)

00:07:52.593 --> 00:07:53.426
- So no, you're there.

00:07:53.426 --> 00:07:54.975
It takes that long to get there,

00:07:54.975 --> 00:07:57.113
and then you're there for
the planets to align again.

00:07:57.113 --> 00:07:59.202
That's another year and
half, two years or so.

00:07:59.202 --> 00:08:00.845
So it's a three, four year,

00:08:00.845 --> 00:08:02.066
round trip to do this.

00:08:02.066 --> 00:08:04.511
So, I mean people are thinking
serious and hard about this.

00:08:04.511 --> 00:08:07.586
And until Mars becomes terraformed,

00:08:07.586 --> 00:08:09.434
you're gonna have to sort
of make do with plants,

00:08:09.434 --> 00:08:10.601
and what Paul?

00:08:12.273 --> 00:08:13.106
- I, okay.

00:08:14.123 --> 00:08:15.873
I read this article--

00:08:17.135 --> 00:08:18.645
- Nothing good ever begins that way.

00:08:18.645 --> 00:08:19.653
(laughing)
- I swear to God.

00:08:19.653 --> 00:08:21.154
(laughing)

00:08:21.154 --> 00:08:21.987
- Except I read this,

00:08:21.987 --> 00:08:22.820
article on the internet.
- There's a very,

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:23.653
sketchy magazine.

00:08:23.653 --> 00:08:24.920
I'll throw it out there.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:25.782
- Which magazine?

00:08:25.782 --> 00:08:26.615
- Life.
- We.

00:08:26.615 --> 00:08:27.448
- Oh We.

00:08:27.448 --> 00:08:28.480
(laughing)

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.627
We which is French for life.

00:08:30.627 --> 00:08:32.931
(laughing)

00:08:32.931 --> 00:08:33.764
and it was all about,

00:08:33.764 --> 00:08:34.672
and this was, God I want to say,

00:08:34.672 --> 00:08:35.922
it was about 20 years ago,

00:08:35.922 --> 00:08:38.203
about the terra formation of Mars.

00:08:38.203 --> 00:08:40.702
And they talked about,

00:08:40.702 --> 00:08:43.371
churning oxygen out of the rocks,

00:08:43.371 --> 00:08:45.204
creating some kind of,

00:08:47.331 --> 00:08:48.164
- Atmosphere.

00:08:48.164 --> 00:08:49.112
- Like an at, well.

00:08:49.112 --> 00:08:50.540
(laughing)
Containment atmosphere.

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:51.373
- Atmosphere.

00:08:51.373 --> 00:08:52.206
(laughing)

00:08:52.206 --> 00:08:53.779
- Let's call it an air shield.

00:08:53.779 --> 00:08:55.462
- An air shield.

00:08:55.462 --> 00:08:56.610
That's what I'm thinking.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:58.693
Like an ozone, yeah yeah.

00:08:59.531 --> 00:09:02.832
That they would descend above the planet,

00:09:02.832 --> 00:09:03.880
would trap in the air,

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.832
and we would have these
kind of habit trails,

00:09:06.832 --> 00:09:07.982
green house,

00:09:07.982 --> 00:09:10.091
where we would grow food.

00:09:10.091 --> 00:09:13.729
They would populate Mars with about,

00:09:13.729 --> 00:09:14.862
50 or so people.

00:09:14.862 --> 00:09:16.019
And over time,

00:09:16.019 --> 00:09:18.368
it would turn into judgment city,

00:09:18.368 --> 00:09:22.190
where it's 73 degrees
and sunny all the time.

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:24.120
- And then you could have your
cows that you were missing.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.059
- Yes so you would eventually,

00:09:26.059 --> 00:09:27.059
you would have cows.

00:09:27.059 --> 00:09:29.298
- Cause a cow is a machine to convert--

00:09:29.298 --> 00:09:30.870
- You'd have to have like
10 for every person though,

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:31.859
cause that makes sense.

00:09:31.859 --> 00:09:33.259
(laughing)

00:09:33.259 --> 00:09:35.208
- No a cow is a machine to turn,

00:09:35.208 --> 00:09:36.960
leaves into steak right.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.008
(laughing)

00:09:40.008 --> 00:09:42.189
- In theory, maybe.

00:09:42.189 --> 00:09:43.022
I don't know.

00:09:43.022 --> 00:09:44.080
- That's what that is.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:44.913
What else is a cow?

00:09:44.913 --> 00:09:46.028
- It's what it was made for, apparently.

00:09:46.028 --> 00:09:48.508
(laughing)

00:09:48.508 --> 00:09:50.400
- I guess really the only point.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.430
I just wanted everyone to know,

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:52.847
that I read Life magazine.

00:09:52.847 --> 00:09:55.178
(laughing)

00:09:55.178 --> 00:09:56.208
- Yeah 'cause you certainly
didn't have a question,

00:09:56.208 --> 00:09:57.041
at the end of that.

00:09:57.041 --> 00:09:57.874
- No, no.

00:09:57.874 --> 00:09:58.976
There was no,

00:09:58.976 --> 00:10:00.648
in fact I was kind of,

00:10:00.648 --> 00:10:02.179
I was talking about it,

00:10:02.179 --> 00:10:03.979
not really knowing where
I was gonna go with it.

00:10:03.979 --> 00:10:05.539
- You used a lot of big words though.

00:10:05.539 --> 00:10:06.590
- Terra formation guys.

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:07.939
I don't know just check it out.

00:10:07.939 --> 00:10:09.459
- And atmosphere.

00:10:09.459 --> 00:10:11.888
- Google it.
- Descend.

00:10:11.888 --> 00:10:13.390
- So good luck with the book.

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:14.487
- Thank you.
- and a book tour now.

00:10:14.487 --> 00:10:15.320
- Thank you yes.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.990
- We're grateful to the book tour,

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:18.470
that you were even available
to us here in New York.

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:19.303
- No it's true,

00:10:19.303 --> 00:10:21.062
I'm actually, I'm going
on Howard Stern tomorrow,

00:10:21.062 --> 00:10:22.880
but I did the Today Show and Rachel Ray,

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.651
and all sorts of places that
people talk about cooking.

00:10:25.651 --> 00:10:26.484
- Excellent.

00:10:26.484 --> 00:10:28.182
So good, good.

00:10:28.182 --> 00:10:29.272
- Thank you.

00:10:29.272 --> 00:10:31.410
- So now another thing
we may know you for,

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:33.387
is as Amy Farrah Fowler,

00:10:33.387 --> 00:10:35.240
on the Big Bang Theory.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.490
(cheering)

00:10:39.011 --> 00:10:41.990
Now I actually had a
cameo on Big Bang Theory,

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:43.560
I think it was before you,

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.279
may have been before you
became a regular character.

00:10:45.279 --> 00:10:47.982
- Yeah I was brought on the
season finale of season three.

00:10:47.982 --> 00:10:49.280
And then I was made a regular,

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.200
along with Melissa Rauch,

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.371
who plays Bernadette,

00:10:51.371 --> 00:10:52.982
about midway through season four.

00:10:52.982 --> 00:10:54.500
- Okay great to have
you as a regular there.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.422
- Thank you.

00:10:55.422 --> 00:10:56.630
Thank you.

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:57.640
- I'm a fan of the show.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:58.691
And it's a show,

00:10:58.691 --> 00:11:00.660
if you're not familiar
with the Big Bang Theory,

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.919
it's the number one sitcom on television.

00:11:02.919 --> 00:11:07.079
But, otherwise, if you're not
a T.V. watching community,

00:11:07.079 --> 00:11:09.246
it's a caricature of sort,

00:11:10.279 --> 00:11:12.397
geeks in their lives.

00:11:12.397 --> 00:11:15.621
And they're professors at
I guess that's Cal Tech.

00:11:15.621 --> 00:11:18.310
- It's a group of
physicists and one engineer,

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:19.311
with only a Masters,

00:11:19.311 --> 00:11:21.479
which he's always teased about yes.

00:11:21.479 --> 00:11:22.570
- Yeah and so,

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:24.690
it's a lot of caricature going on there.

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:26.901
And it's been criticized for being,

00:11:26.901 --> 00:11:28.191
for it's stereotypes and I'm thinking,

00:11:28.191 --> 00:11:29.199
it's a T.V. show.

00:11:29.199 --> 00:11:31.261
Just let it do what it has to do.

00:11:31.261 --> 00:11:33.511
You play a I don't want to,

00:11:35.821 --> 00:11:36.789
a sexually frustrated.

00:11:36.789 --> 00:11:39.039
(laughing)

00:11:39.999 --> 00:11:41.431
- Like every woman in science.

00:11:41.431 --> 00:11:44.381
(laughing)

00:11:44.381 --> 00:11:45.338
- Not every woman.

00:11:45.338 --> 00:11:46.558
(laughing)

00:11:46.558 --> 00:11:48.808
(clapping)

00:11:49.701 --> 00:11:51.110
- You preach sister.

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:52.421
- Just to clarify.
- Touche.

00:11:52.421 --> 00:11:53.254
(laughing)

00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:54.087
- You talk girl.

00:11:54.087 --> 00:11:55.071
- Touche.

00:11:55.071 --> 00:11:57.871
(laughing)

00:11:57.871 --> 00:11:59.121
- So it's just,

00:12:00.141 --> 00:12:01.301
what's interesting to me is,

00:12:01.301 --> 00:12:04.221
they each have some kind
of psychological issues.

00:12:04.221 --> 00:12:05.970
I think you're love interest,

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:07.450
who is Sheldon.

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:09.981
I think he comes closest to
what anyone might describe,

00:12:09.981 --> 00:12:12.919
as having Asperger or some other kind of,

00:12:12.919 --> 00:12:14.631
non social behavior.

00:12:14.631 --> 00:12:16.118
- Right so he,

00:12:16.118 --> 00:12:18.288
so all of our characters are,

00:12:18.288 --> 00:12:22.810
in theory, on the neuropsychiatric
spectrum, I would say.

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:25.319
Sheldon often gets talked about,

00:12:25.319 --> 00:12:27.231
in terms of Asperger or OCD.

00:12:27.231 --> 00:12:29.421
He has a thing with germs.

00:12:29.421 --> 00:12:31.570
He has a thing with numbers.

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:34.449
He's got a lot of sort of
that precision that we see,

00:12:34.449 --> 00:12:35.728
in OCD.

00:12:35.728 --> 00:12:37.471
And there's a lot of interesting features,

00:12:37.471 --> 00:12:38.837
to all of our characters,

00:12:38.837 --> 00:12:41.850
that make them technically
unconventional socially.

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:44.431
And I think what's
interesting and kind of sweet,

00:12:44.431 --> 00:12:46.479
and I think should not be lost on people,

00:12:46.479 --> 00:12:49.309
is that we don't
pathologize our characters.

00:12:49.309 --> 00:12:51.661
We don't talk about medicating them,

00:12:51.661 --> 00:12:53.427
or even really changing them.

00:12:53.427 --> 00:12:55.109
And I think that's what's interesting for,

00:12:55.109 --> 00:12:57.589
those of us who are
unconventional people or,

00:12:57.589 --> 00:13:01.170
who know and love people who
are on any sort of spectrum,

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:03.581
we often find ways to work around that.

00:13:03.581 --> 00:13:04.909
It doesn't always need to be solved,

00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:06.087
and medicated and labeled.

00:13:06.087 --> 00:13:07.807
And what we're trying to
show with our show is that,

00:13:07.807 --> 00:13:09.748
this is a group of people who,

00:13:09.748 --> 00:13:12.948
likely were teased, mocked,
told that they will never be,

00:13:12.948 --> 00:13:14.506
appreciated or loved.

00:13:14.506 --> 00:13:16.098
And we have a group of people who have,

00:13:16.098 --> 00:13:18.199
careers, successful careers,

00:13:18.199 --> 00:13:20.226
active social lives that involve,

00:13:20.226 --> 00:13:22.167
things like Dungeons and
Dragons and video games.

00:13:22.167 --> 00:13:23.447
But they also have relationships.

00:13:23.447 --> 00:13:26.865
And that's a fulfilling
and satisfying life.

00:13:26.865 --> 00:13:29.626
And I think that's what we
really try and show on our show.

00:13:29.626 --> 00:13:31.207
- I never thought to,

00:13:31.207 --> 00:13:32.040
yes yes.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:36.637
(cheering)
(clapping)

00:13:36.637 --> 00:13:40.157
Heather, there does seem to
be this trend in society,

00:13:40.157 --> 00:13:41.857
that if someone is some,

00:13:41.857 --> 00:13:44.287
finds themselves on some extreme,

00:13:44.287 --> 00:13:46.397
of some behavior spectrum,

00:13:46.397 --> 00:13:47.896
that you have to put
em back in the middle,

00:13:47.896 --> 00:13:49.075
like everybody else.

00:13:49.075 --> 00:13:52.967
And is that a good, that
can't be a good thing, right?

00:13:52.967 --> 00:13:53.800
- Can I tell you what,

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.538
we in the Church of
Scientology believe about this?

00:13:55.538 --> 00:13:57.788
(laughing)

00:14:00.709 --> 00:14:01.542
- Well,

00:14:03.029 --> 00:14:04.776
I think there's a movement
in psychiatry now.

00:14:04.776 --> 00:14:07.269
So while I think labeling is important,

00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:09.669
in certain respects because
it can help clinicians,

00:14:09.669 --> 00:14:11.658
talk about people in a certain way,

00:14:11.658 --> 00:14:12.949
it can help with treatment.

00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:16.029
But there are other
negative aspects to it.

00:14:16.029 --> 00:14:17.338
People can get,

00:14:17.338 --> 00:14:18.216
labeled with something,

00:14:18.216 --> 00:14:19.549
and it sticks with them for life.

00:14:19.549 --> 00:14:20.382
And the whole--

00:14:20.382 --> 00:14:21.258
- Like psychopath.

00:14:21.258 --> 00:14:23.508
(laughing)

00:14:28.046 --> 00:14:29.087
Not easy to get around.

00:14:29.087 --> 00:14:31.496
(laughing)

00:14:31.496 --> 00:14:34.389
- It's hard to shake that label, yeah.

00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:35.599
- You try and you try.

00:14:35.599 --> 00:14:37.349
(laughing)

00:14:37.349 --> 00:14:38.378
- Difficult to treat psychopaths,

00:14:38.378 --> 00:14:39.349
'cause they don't present.

00:14:39.349 --> 00:14:40.267
I mean the whole.

00:14:40.267 --> 00:14:42.058
(laughing)

00:14:42.058 --> 00:14:44.007
- 'Cause they don't go,

00:14:44.007 --> 00:14:45.207
like psychopath.

00:14:45.207 --> 00:14:46.567
(laughing)

00:14:46.567 --> 00:14:47.669
- Like, I'm a psychopath.

00:14:47.669 --> 00:14:50.226
No so, people normally come for treatment,

00:14:50.226 --> 00:14:51.719
when they're feeling distressed.

00:14:51.719 --> 00:14:52.679
And there are a lot of people,

00:14:52.679 --> 00:14:53.927
who are labeled with a disorder,

00:14:53.927 --> 00:14:55.549
who can get on perfectly fine,

00:14:55.549 --> 00:14:57.269
who don't necessarily need treatment.

00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:58.102
And even now--

00:14:58.102 --> 00:14:59.045
- That is not a disorder.

00:14:59.045 --> 00:14:59.927
It's just an order.

00:14:59.927 --> 00:15:01.602
- Yeah it just has to do
with the amount of distress,

00:15:01.602 --> 00:15:03.189
it's causing to the person.

00:15:03.189 --> 00:15:04.573
And now I think,

00:15:04.573 --> 00:15:07.711
the new DSM, which is the
Diagnostic Statistical Manual,

00:15:07.711 --> 00:15:09.362
that we use to diagnose,

00:15:09.362 --> 00:15:11.060
different psychiatric disorders,

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:12.661
has now actually taken away,

00:15:12.661 --> 00:15:13.639
the label Asperger.

00:15:13.639 --> 00:15:16.141
And now, things like autism or pervasive,

00:15:16.141 --> 00:15:17.090
development disorder,

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:17.923
or Asperger,

00:15:17.923 --> 00:15:20.290
are all put under this name of,

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:21.909
autism spectrum disorders.

00:15:21.909 --> 00:15:23.882
- Well and also Thomas
Insula is trying to do away,

00:15:23.882 --> 00:15:25.158
with the structure of the DSM,

00:15:25.158 --> 00:15:26.450
four or five as we know it,

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:30.789
to say more that we are
all along the lines of,

00:15:30.789 --> 00:15:32.658
many spectrums, right.

00:15:32.658 --> 00:15:34.229
- So yeah, so the way that,

00:15:34.229 --> 00:15:36.333
so Tom Insula is the head of the NIH,

00:15:36.333 --> 00:15:37.408
the National Institute of Health.

00:15:37.408 --> 00:15:39.988
And the way psychiatric
diagnosis is going,

00:15:39.988 --> 00:15:41.349
and the way that I apply for grants,

00:15:41.349 --> 00:15:42.187
let's say to do research,

00:15:42.187 --> 00:15:43.210
is that instead of saying,

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:44.549
I'm gonna study a disorder,

00:15:44.549 --> 00:15:46.738
because a lot of people with different,

00:15:46.738 --> 00:15:47.930
psychiatric problems,

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:49.178
can be labeled as one disorder,

00:15:49.178 --> 00:15:51.440
we're now gonna look at these
different dimensions and say,

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.730
okay is this person having problems,

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:53.880
like emotional instability,

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:55.216
or impulsivity.

00:15:55.216 --> 00:15:58.370
And try to find the neural basis
of those particular traits,

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:00.578
and treat that rather than the disorder.

00:16:00.578 --> 00:16:01.577
- And never think of it as a disorder.

00:16:01.577 --> 00:16:02.410
This is good.

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:05.549
So, the Big Bang Theory is
leading the way in this.

00:16:05.549 --> 00:16:06.490
- We are at the forefront.

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:07.323
- Oh yes.

00:16:07.323 --> 00:16:08.156
(laughing)

00:16:08.156 --> 00:16:09.930
- It's an interesting discussion.

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:12.389
I know I sometimes suffer from depression.

00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:13.222
And when I get stressed out,

00:16:13.222 --> 00:16:14.320
I just burn down a building now,

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.617
instead of taking my pills.

00:16:15.617 --> 00:16:17.280
(laughing)

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:18.280
That works great for me.

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.669
- Did you learn that
from the Big Bang Theory?

00:16:19.669 --> 00:16:21.070
(laughing)

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:21.903
- No.

00:16:21.903 --> 00:16:23.241
(laughing)

00:16:23.241 --> 00:16:24.600
I learned it from burning down buildings.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.072
(laughing)

00:16:26.072 --> 00:16:30.541
- So Mayim, do they have
neuroscience advisor on the show?

00:16:30.541 --> 00:16:31.909
I met the physics advisor there.

00:16:31.909 --> 00:16:34.329
- Dr. Saltzberg, yeah,
David Saltzberg from,

00:16:34.329 --> 00:16:35.752
UCLA, a very fine university.

00:16:35.752 --> 00:16:36.585
- Right.

00:16:36.585 --> 00:16:37.650
Where you got your PhD.

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:39.410
- And my undergrad degree as well.

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:41.392
Yeah we have a physics consultant who,

00:16:41.392 --> 00:16:45.261
he also has a vast knowledge
of general science,

00:16:45.261 --> 00:16:47.640
as those of us who are
trained in science tend to.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.120
We have a smattering of this and that.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.450
- So use him for even the neuro stuff.

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:52.221
- Sometimes I am used.

00:16:52.221 --> 00:16:53.054
- Oh yeah.

00:16:53.054 --> 00:16:55.021
(laughing)

00:16:55.021 --> 00:16:57.759
- I mean we have a really
exceptionally intelligent,

00:16:57.759 --> 00:16:58.610
interesting group of writers.

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:01.530
Many of whom have science backgrounds.

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:03.552
But yes, sometimes I
get strange emails like,

00:17:03.552 --> 00:17:05.421
what part of the brain
needs to be not working,

00:17:05.421 --> 00:17:06.970
for us to have this happen.

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:09.061
Or, what should Amy be doing in her lab?

00:17:09.061 --> 00:17:11.381
Or we had a couple scenes in
the episode we just filmed,

00:17:11.381 --> 00:17:13.730
where I needed to have
three different activities,

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:14.952
that I'm doing in my lab.

00:17:14.952 --> 00:17:17.981
And Amy's lab is not a
perfect neuroscience lab,

00:17:17.981 --> 00:17:19.072
or neurobiology lab.

00:17:19.072 --> 00:17:21.650
So I tried to at least make things look,

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:22.650
authentic for what we're doing.

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:24.616
It's not always perfect.

00:17:24.616 --> 00:17:26.050
I get a lot of interesting comments.

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:27.432
Why would she be doing research,

00:17:27.432 --> 00:17:29.202
in social affect in capuchins,

00:17:29.202 --> 00:17:31.463
if she's also counting spores.

00:17:31.463 --> 00:17:32.296
- I had that question.

00:17:32.296 --> 00:17:33.242
(laughing)

00:17:33.242 --> 00:17:35.322
(talking at once)

00:17:35.322 --> 00:17:36.682
I watched that episode and I was like,

00:17:36.682 --> 00:17:37.515
that's bullshit.

00:17:37.515 --> 00:17:39.765
(laughing)

00:17:42.144 --> 00:17:43.744
Social affect in capuchin monkeys.

00:17:43.744 --> 00:17:45.077
Give me a break.

00:17:47.055 --> 00:17:49.976
- You don't need me to confer on this but,

00:17:49.976 --> 00:17:52.957
the white boards that had equations,

00:17:52.957 --> 00:17:54.726
on the episode that I appear in,

00:17:54.726 --> 00:17:55.559
- Racist.

00:17:55.559 --> 00:17:57.809
(laughing)

00:18:00.096 --> 00:18:00.929
- They used to be black boards.

00:18:00.929 --> 00:18:01.816
What happened?

00:18:01.816 --> 00:18:04.517
(laughing)

00:18:04.517 --> 00:18:07.100
So it had equations drawn from,

00:18:08.014 --> 00:18:08.917
my research.

00:18:08.917 --> 00:18:10.848
And then the guy asked me, he said,

00:18:10.848 --> 00:18:11.986
"Did you recognize something on the set?"

00:18:11.986 --> 00:18:13.236
(laughing)

00:18:13.236 --> 00:18:14.069
- It's a nerd fest over there.

00:18:14.069 --> 00:18:15.086
It's a nerd fest.

00:18:15.086 --> 00:18:16.408
- And it turns out,

00:18:16.408 --> 00:18:18.487
he got equations from another Tyson,

00:18:18.487 --> 00:18:19.818
doing research in astrophysics,

00:18:19.818 --> 00:18:20.818
not from me.

00:18:20.818 --> 00:18:22.438
(laughing)

00:18:22.438 --> 00:18:23.279
So, but that's okay.
- Was it the male model,

00:18:23.279 --> 00:18:24.288
Tyson gay?

00:18:24.288 --> 00:18:25.549
(laughing)

00:18:25.549 --> 00:18:27.698
'Cause he's wonderful.

00:18:27.698 --> 00:18:28.531
A reference nobody got.

00:18:28.531 --> 00:18:30.888
(laughing)

00:18:30.888 --> 00:18:32.389
- So is there a,

00:18:32.389 --> 00:18:34.320
in your own life experience,

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.669
or in the show,

00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:38.600
tell me about women in science.

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.600
How is that treated and thought about?

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:44.029
- Gosh I mean lots of different
ways in my personal brain.

00:18:44.029 --> 00:18:45.600
But in terms of sort of,

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:49.433
presenting or representing
a female scientist,

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:51.528
there were no other neuroscientists,

00:18:51.528 --> 00:18:52.949
at my audition,

00:18:52.949 --> 00:18:55.640
you know when I auditioned
to play Amy Farrah Fowler.

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.138
It was a group of very talented actresses.

00:18:58.138 --> 00:18:59.229
But you know as actors,

00:18:59.229 --> 00:19:01.000
we are paid to play,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.280
whatever's on the page.

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.000
We don't have to really
be that in real life.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.818
So that was really just
sort of an accident.

00:19:06.818 --> 00:19:07.724
I feel very lucky that I had that.

00:19:07.724 --> 00:19:09.076
- I was so disappointed when I learned,

00:19:09.076 --> 00:19:10.966
Raj was not an actual astrophysicist.

00:19:10.966 --> 00:19:11.937
- Yeah no.

00:19:11.937 --> 00:19:12.770
- He was an actor.

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:14.770
- Yeah we're all actors.

00:19:16.257 --> 00:19:17.646
No but I think when people,

00:19:17.646 --> 00:19:18.895
especially criticize or say,

00:19:18.895 --> 00:19:20.337
it's such a stereotype.

00:19:20.337 --> 00:19:23.077
I know people like all those characters.

00:19:23.077 --> 00:19:25.977
I promise, I hang out with them sometimes.

00:19:25.977 --> 00:19:28.926
No I know women like Amy Farrah Fowler.

00:19:28.926 --> 00:19:30.958
I was asked to do,

00:19:30.958 --> 00:19:33.096
a female Jim Parson's impression,

00:19:33.096 --> 00:19:34.006
was literally the audition.

00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:35.748
I had never seen Big Bang Theory.

00:19:35.748 --> 00:19:36.581
And I was told,

00:19:36.581 --> 00:19:38.177
they are looking for a female Jim Parsons.

00:19:38.177 --> 00:19:39.010
I said that's great,

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:39.878
whose Jim Parsons.

00:19:39.878 --> 00:19:42.358
And I Google Jim the night before,

00:19:42.358 --> 00:19:45.446
and I saw about 10 seconds
of him doing his Sheldon bit.

00:19:45.446 --> 00:19:46.615
And I thought, I can do that.

00:19:46.615 --> 00:19:50.057
I know tons of people like that.

00:19:50.057 --> 00:19:51.977
So yeah, so I didn't have to present,

00:19:51.977 --> 00:19:54.228
as a scientist per say that way.

00:19:54.228 --> 00:19:56.657
But Amy is based on,

00:19:56.657 --> 00:19:58.628
a few female professors in particular.

00:19:58.628 --> 00:20:00.036
And a few male professors as well.

00:20:00.036 --> 00:20:00.869
- Out of your own life,

00:20:00.869 --> 00:20:01.806
that you've assembled.

00:20:01.806 --> 00:20:04.246
- Yeah I mean I spent
12 years in academia.

00:20:04.246 --> 00:20:05.956
I've met a lot of interesting people,

00:20:05.956 --> 00:20:07.937
in neuroscience.

00:20:07.937 --> 00:20:09.996
So yeah she's based on a lot of,

00:20:09.996 --> 00:20:12.788
real qualities and real things that exist.

00:20:12.788 --> 00:20:15.427
And there's all sorts of
men and women in science.

00:20:15.427 --> 00:20:17.725
And there were professors
in my department,

00:20:17.725 --> 00:20:19.956
who looked like models,
both male and female.

00:20:19.956 --> 00:20:20.789
And there were those that looked,

00:20:20.789 --> 00:20:22.744
like the characters on Big Bang.

00:20:22.744 --> 00:20:25.596
The fact that we present Amy as sort of,

00:20:25.596 --> 00:20:28.076
frumpy, they dress me
a couple sizes too big,

00:20:28.076 --> 00:20:30.417
and very kind of low
on the aesthetic level,

00:20:30.417 --> 00:20:32.566
that's not a statement
that women scientists,

00:20:32.566 --> 00:20:33.425
can't be attractive.

00:20:33.425 --> 00:20:35.074
That's a very specific thing that,

00:20:35.074 --> 00:20:36.685
our writers wanted to craft,

00:20:36.685 --> 00:20:38.383
for the Sheldon, Amy relationship.

00:20:38.383 --> 00:20:40.596
But the Bernadette character
is a microbiologist.

00:20:40.596 --> 00:20:42.078
And she gets to wear false lashes,

00:20:42.078 --> 00:20:43.164
and she wears,

00:20:43.164 --> 00:20:45.025
fancier clothes than I do.

00:20:45.025 --> 00:20:46.787
But I love that I get to,

00:20:46.787 --> 00:20:48.697
go to work and put on slouchy clothes.

00:20:48.697 --> 00:20:50.034
I don't have to wear Spanx.

00:20:50.034 --> 00:20:52.337
I don't have to spend
long on hair and makeup.

00:20:52.337 --> 00:20:53.236
It's very comfortable,

00:20:53.236 --> 00:20:56.166
to be that kind of person and scientist.

00:20:56.166 --> 00:20:57.336
- I wonder is there any,

00:20:57.336 --> 00:21:01.145
correlation between
extreme science talent,

00:21:01.145 --> 00:21:03.562
and absence of social graces.

00:21:04.784 --> 00:21:06.385
Heather is there any research.

00:21:06.385 --> 00:21:07.218
The reason why I ask it,

00:21:07.218 --> 00:21:08.196
'cause that's the stereotype.

00:21:08.196 --> 00:21:09.985
It's been with us forever.

00:21:09.985 --> 00:21:11.697
And it's exploited on the Big Bang Theory.

00:21:11.697 --> 00:21:13.337
- Name one stereotype that's not true.

00:21:13.337 --> 00:21:15.587
(laughing)

00:21:17.495 --> 00:21:18.662
Fine name two.

00:21:20.806 --> 00:21:22.005
- Well I mean,

00:21:22.005 --> 00:21:23.017
so people in academia,

00:21:23.017 --> 00:21:23.905
there is a stereotype.

00:21:23.905 --> 00:21:25.065
And the reason for the stereotype,

00:21:25.065 --> 00:21:26.556
is there are a lot of people,

00:21:26.556 --> 00:21:28.897
particularly in the
sciences and engineering,

00:21:28.897 --> 00:21:30.945
that think very,

00:21:30.945 --> 00:21:32.566
you have to think very methodically.

00:21:32.566 --> 00:21:34.124
And the types of personalities,

00:21:34.124 --> 00:21:35.576
the types of dedication it takes,

00:21:35.576 --> 00:21:36.956
to be an academic is,

00:21:36.956 --> 00:21:39.057
in essentially you have
to be a bit asocial.

00:21:39.057 --> 00:21:40.766
So I think it attracts people,

00:21:40.766 --> 00:21:42.065
who tend to be a bit asocial,

00:21:42.065 --> 00:21:43.276
think very rigidly.

00:21:43.276 --> 00:21:44.897
You need to be a bit obsessive compulsive,

00:21:44.897 --> 00:21:45.737
about whatever it is,

00:21:45.737 --> 00:21:46.734
that you're studying.

00:21:46.734 --> 00:21:48.766
- But is it that it
attracts asocial people,

00:21:48.766 --> 00:21:52.436
or that the field does
not reject asocial people,

00:21:52.436 --> 00:21:54.268
the way so many other fields would.

00:21:54.268 --> 00:21:55.377
- Well it could be a little--

00:21:55.377 --> 00:21:57.146
- Yes, Neil that's what it is.

00:21:57.146 --> 00:21:59.796
(laughing)

00:21:59.796 --> 00:22:02.796
- Well, there's one false correl ...

00:22:03.987 --> 00:22:06.176
One thing that people think is that,

00:22:06.176 --> 00:22:08.009
that necessitates that high intelligence,

00:22:08.009 --> 00:22:10.419
necessitates these
personality characteristics.

00:22:10.419 --> 00:22:12.180
And that's not particularly true.

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:14.110
There's not a higher,

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:15.659
high corelation between high intelligence,

00:22:15.659 --> 00:22:17.100
and say Asperger.

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:20.358
So I think it's more that it
attracts people to the field,

00:22:20.358 --> 00:22:24.459
rather than it's correlated
per say with high intelligence.

00:22:24.459 --> 00:22:25.473
- So, okay.

00:22:25.473 --> 00:22:26.832
And of course in the Big Bang Theory,

00:22:26.832 --> 00:22:29.593
everyone there is like wicked smart right.

00:22:29.593 --> 00:22:30.694
(laughing)

00:22:30.694 --> 00:22:31.527
That's everybody.

00:22:31.527 --> 00:22:33.777
(laughing)

00:22:35.769 --> 00:22:37.270
- Well it's a bunch of
professors at Cal Tech.

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:38.681
I don't know.
- There you go.

00:22:38.681 --> 00:22:39.572
- Those are smart people.

00:22:39.572 --> 00:22:41.390
- I just skipped over a note here.

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:42.223
I want to go back to it.

00:22:42.223 --> 00:22:43.412
After you got your PhD,

00:22:43.412 --> 00:22:45.020
you were a school teacher.

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:46.262
I taught,

00:22:46.262 --> 00:22:48.470
I designed a curriculum for neuroscience.

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:50.159
I taught in the homeschool
community in Los Angeles,

00:22:50.159 --> 00:22:51.901
for junior high and high school.

00:22:51.901 --> 00:22:53.382
I did basic neuroscience.

00:22:53.382 --> 00:22:54.854
I designed a course on,

00:22:54.854 --> 00:22:56.915
technological advances in neuroscience.

00:22:56.915 --> 00:22:59.203
I also taught high school biology,

00:22:59.203 --> 00:23:00.195
in the home school community.

00:23:00.195 --> 00:23:01.028
- It's so crazy to me,

00:23:01.028 --> 00:23:02.834
'cause our resumes are almost identical.

00:23:02.834 --> 00:23:05.774
(laughing)

00:23:05.774 --> 00:23:06.835
- Yeah I had my--

00:23:06.835 --> 00:23:07.795
- Wait.

00:23:07.795 --> 00:23:08.628
My question.

00:23:08.628 --> 00:23:10.193
What does it mean to homeschool,

00:23:10.193 --> 00:23:12.235
as a teacher that isn't,

00:23:12.235 --> 00:23:13.145
you know what I'm saying.

00:23:13.145 --> 00:23:13.978
- That you don't live there.

00:23:13.978 --> 00:23:15.515
- How do you homeschool--

00:23:15.515 --> 00:23:17.343
- Is there a, yeah exactly.

00:23:17.343 --> 00:23:19.475
Is there a community of homeschool people,

00:23:19.475 --> 00:23:21.633
that all meet up to have
their own secret school.

00:23:21.633 --> 00:23:22.466
- Yes.

00:23:23.394 --> 00:23:24.606
Well so often,

00:23:24.606 --> 00:23:26.675
often for higher level classes,

00:23:26.675 --> 00:23:28.446
like junior high and high school science,

00:23:28.446 --> 00:23:30.174
a tutor or a teacher is hired,

00:23:30.174 --> 00:23:31.574
and you meet usually in a home.

00:23:31.574 --> 00:23:33.465
Sometimes people meet in
parks or community centers.

00:23:33.465 --> 00:23:34.974
- It's a pack of kids there
who are all homeschooled.

00:23:34.974 --> 00:23:37.085
- Yeah I mean I taught
10 high school students,

00:23:37.085 --> 00:23:39.275
who were getting ready to
start taking community college.

00:23:39.275 --> 00:23:41.995
And yeah I was the person
on the Big Bang Theory,

00:23:41.995 --> 00:23:43.594
was their biology teacher.

00:23:43.594 --> 00:23:44.555
It was kind of freaky for them.

00:23:44.555 --> 00:23:45.694
(laughing)

00:23:45.694 --> 00:23:46.804
- Okay and you're also involved,

00:23:46.804 --> 00:23:48.835
in a STEM initiative I've been reading.

00:23:48.835 --> 00:23:50.074
- Yeah I'm the spokesperson for--

00:23:50.074 --> 00:23:51.702
- Science, technology,
engineering, and math.

00:23:51.702 --> 00:23:52.535
- Magic.
- I'm the spokesperson,

00:23:52.535 --> 00:23:54.694
for Texas Instruments which is the--

00:23:54.694 --> 00:23:55.527
- Really?

00:23:55.527 --> 00:23:56.360
- Yeah I've been their spokesperson.

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:57.193
This is my third year.

00:23:57.193 --> 00:23:59.275
So I've had a TI81,

00:23:59.275 --> 00:24:00.108
depends on how old you are,

00:24:00.108 --> 00:24:01.105
what TI version you had.

00:24:01.105 --> 00:24:02.145
(cheering)

00:24:02.145 --> 00:24:04.035
Yay there's people my age.

00:24:04.035 --> 00:24:06.694
- That's the Terminator
that comes back to kill,

00:24:06.694 --> 00:24:07.883
Arnold Schwarzenegger right?

00:24:07.883 --> 00:24:10.133
(laughing)

00:24:10.133 --> 00:24:11.523
He's the scariest one of all.

00:24:11.523 --> 00:24:12.603
- That's the TI82.

00:24:12.603 --> 00:24:13.894
(laughing)

00:24:13.894 --> 00:24:14.966
- What it the TI81,

00:24:14.966 --> 00:24:15.882
say we're not,

00:24:15.882 --> 00:24:17.022
whatever the age you are.
- It's the handheld,

00:24:17.022 --> 00:24:17.855
graphing calculators.

00:24:17.855 --> 00:24:19.755
So I got mine I think when I was 14.

00:24:19.755 --> 00:24:21.875
And that same graphing calculator took me,

00:24:21.875 --> 00:24:23.323
all the way through
junior high, high school,

00:24:23.323 --> 00:24:25.163
into college and grad school.

00:24:25.163 --> 00:24:27.915
But there's a new one
called the TI Inspire,

00:24:27.915 --> 00:24:29.323
that now is in color,

00:24:29.323 --> 00:24:30.374
and you can download images.

00:24:30.374 --> 00:24:32.825
And you can create
parables from basketballs,

00:24:32.825 --> 00:24:34.854
images of basketballs being shot.

00:24:34.854 --> 00:24:35.687
It's exciting.

00:24:35.687 --> 00:24:37.134
And so there's also a bunch of physics.

00:24:37.134 --> 00:24:38.238
(laughing)

00:24:38.238 --> 00:24:39.953
There's a bunch of physics
and chemistry stuff.

00:24:39.953 --> 00:24:41.094
- I had no parable machine.

00:24:41.094 --> 00:24:43.462
(laughing)

00:24:43.462 --> 00:24:44.454
But I had a notebook that was great,

00:24:44.454 --> 00:24:45.902
covered in bands I liked.

00:24:45.902 --> 00:24:47.294
(laughing)

00:24:47.294 --> 00:24:49.202
- Can you type in those letters,

00:24:49.202 --> 00:24:51.603
and then when you hold
it upside it says hello?

00:24:51.603 --> 00:24:52.833
- Yes!

00:24:52.833 --> 00:24:53.782
You can still do that.

00:24:53.782 --> 00:24:54.615
- You know it's good then.

00:24:54.615 --> 00:24:55.494
You know it's a good one.

00:24:55.494 --> 00:24:56.923
(laughing)

00:24:56.923 --> 00:24:57.756
- Yes.

00:24:57.756 --> 00:24:58.589
- In my day,

00:24:58.589 --> 00:25:00.942
there was the TI people,

00:25:00.942 --> 00:25:02.542
and then the HP people,

00:25:02.542 --> 00:25:04.473
who had reverse polish notation.

00:25:04.473 --> 00:25:05.306
- Uh huh.

00:25:05.306 --> 00:25:06.563
- And those were the cool kids.

00:25:06.563 --> 00:25:08.233
There's still that debate going on,

00:25:08.233 --> 00:25:09.662
when I go to conferences, yeah.

00:25:09.662 --> 00:25:10.495
- I'm just saying.

00:25:10.495 --> 00:25:12.494
- In my community, it's between
Twizzlers and Red Vines.

00:25:12.494 --> 00:25:14.744
(laughing)

00:25:17.611 --> 00:25:19.014
- You can spell boob in both.

00:25:19.014 --> 00:25:21.264
(laughing)

00:25:24.863 --> 00:25:26.073
- This is what they do with
the calculators we got.

00:25:26.073 --> 00:25:26.923
- I know.

00:25:26.923 --> 00:25:28.545
(laughing)

00:25:28.545 --> 00:25:29.545
So Mayim,

00:25:29.545 --> 00:25:31.214
there's also,

00:25:31.214 --> 00:25:33.283
everyone has odd relationships
with their parents.

00:25:33.283 --> 00:25:35.793
Yet your, I mean in the show.

00:25:35.793 --> 00:25:36.626
- Oh.

00:25:36.626 --> 00:25:38.465
(laughing)

00:25:38.465 --> 00:25:39.403
- I was like wow.

00:25:39.403 --> 00:25:41.734
(laughing)

00:25:41.734 --> 00:25:42.582
- Your character,

00:25:42.582 --> 00:25:44.473
we don't know your,

00:25:44.473 --> 00:25:46.772
will your family come into it?

00:25:46.772 --> 00:25:48.225
- There was one episode,

00:25:48.225 --> 00:25:50.763
with, the reason I'm laughing,

00:25:50.763 --> 00:25:51.654
it'll be funny in a second.

00:25:51.654 --> 00:25:56.161
There was an episode where Amy
wants to convince her mother,

00:25:56.161 --> 00:25:57.443
that she's dating someone.

00:25:57.443 --> 00:25:59.683
This is before she and
Sheldon were dating.

00:25:59.683 --> 00:26:02.072
So she asks him to pretend
like he's her boyfriend,

00:26:02.072 --> 00:26:03.894
and they Skype with her mom.

00:26:03.894 --> 00:26:05.184
So there was a mom scene.

00:26:05.184 --> 00:26:06.814
And he says to her,

00:26:06.814 --> 00:26:08.743
'cause he's trying to convince Amy's mom,

00:26:08.743 --> 00:26:09.713
that they're dating.

00:26:09.713 --> 00:26:11.934
I just made love to
your daughter's vagina.

00:26:11.934 --> 00:26:14.105
(laughing)

00:26:14.105 --> 00:26:15.705
and that was the end of the Skype call.

00:26:15.705 --> 00:26:18.302
(laughing)

00:26:18.302 --> 00:26:19.135
Sorry.

00:26:19.135 --> 00:26:19.968
Is that okay to say?

00:26:19.968 --> 00:26:21.033
(laughing)

00:26:21.033 --> 00:26:21.993
- It's okay to say.

00:26:21.993 --> 00:26:22.905
- I didn't write it.

00:26:22.905 --> 00:26:23.738
- [Eugene] I don't get it.

00:26:23.738 --> 00:26:25.833
(laughing)

00:26:25.833 --> 00:26:27.214
I'll tell you later.

00:26:27.214 --> 00:26:28.923
- If you can say it on CBS.

00:26:28.923 --> 00:26:30.784
(laughing)

00:26:30.784 --> 00:26:31.865
- Well on the subject of sex,

00:26:31.865 --> 00:26:33.294
in the Big Bang Theory,

00:26:33.294 --> 00:26:34.344
there's a lot of,

00:26:34.344 --> 00:26:35.963
sexual tension everywhere.

00:26:35.963 --> 00:26:38.213
(laughing)

00:26:39.113 --> 00:26:40.750
- In restaurants, in butts.

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:43.225
(laughing)

00:26:43.225 --> 00:26:44.558
- You have some,

00:26:46.374 --> 00:26:47.443
so Mayim,

00:26:47.443 --> 00:26:48.473
- Yes I'm listening.

00:26:48.473 --> 00:26:49.723
- You have this sort of,

00:26:49.723 --> 00:26:52.853
dual attraction to Sheldon and to Penny.

00:26:52.853 --> 00:26:54.283
- Amy is bi-curious.

00:26:54.283 --> 00:26:55.345
- Bi-curious.

00:26:55.345 --> 00:26:56.683
There's a word for that, okay.

00:26:56.683 --> 00:26:57.516
- We're in Brooklyn.

00:26:57.516 --> 00:26:58.349
Of course there is.

00:26:58.349 --> 00:27:00.599
(laughing)

00:27:01.443 --> 00:27:02.305
- It's bi-curious.

00:27:02.305 --> 00:27:04.905
And it's charming to watch that.

00:27:04.905 --> 00:27:06.143
- Yeah there was a lot,

00:27:06.143 --> 00:27:07.093
in season four,

00:27:07.093 --> 00:27:09.145
there was a lot of the,

00:27:09.145 --> 00:27:11.185
understanding that for some people,

00:27:11.185 --> 00:27:12.265
and Amy was one of them,

00:27:12.265 --> 00:27:15.774
who arrive late to social
interactions like that,

00:27:15.774 --> 00:27:17.614
and especially sort of sexual feelings,

00:27:17.614 --> 00:27:19.264
and feelings of intimacy,

00:27:19.264 --> 00:27:21.403
there's an appreciation
of all kinds of beauty.

00:27:21.403 --> 00:27:23.873
And obviously Sheldon is
very attractive to Amy,

00:27:23.873 --> 00:27:25.785
for a lot of reasons but,

00:27:25.785 --> 00:27:27.734
Penny is as well.

00:27:27.734 --> 00:27:29.983
- And there's also Raj,

00:27:29.983 --> 00:27:31.814
I think there's a,

00:27:31.814 --> 00:27:33.224
he's bi- interested, what was the word?

00:27:33.224 --> 00:27:34.057
- Bi-curious.

00:27:34.057 --> 00:27:35.145
- Bi-curious yeah.

00:27:35.145 --> 00:27:37.105
- Are you learning about
bi-curious right now?

00:27:37.105 --> 00:27:38.942
- [Neil] Yeah, yeah.

00:27:38.942 --> 00:27:40.601
- That makes me very happy.

00:27:40.601 --> 00:27:43.441
(laughing)

00:27:43.441 --> 00:27:45.191
- Yes Raj and Howard,

00:27:46.033 --> 00:27:49.222
have a very special relationship.

00:27:49.222 --> 00:27:50.673
- Somebody doesn't go on Craigslist.

00:27:50.673 --> 00:27:52.923
(laughing)

00:27:58.971 --> 00:28:00.690
- Well to take us out
of this first segment.

00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:02.940
(laughing)

00:28:04.261 --> 00:28:05.844
There's an episode,

00:28:06.753 --> 00:28:10.142
the Gothowitz Deviation
I think it was called,

00:28:10.142 --> 00:28:11.691
where there's a discussion,

00:28:11.691 --> 00:28:14.121
about modifying people's behavior.

00:28:14.121 --> 00:28:17.401
And Sheldon modifies Penny's behavior,

00:28:17.401 --> 00:28:19.481
by offering her chocolate.

00:28:19.481 --> 00:28:22.921
And she changes her behavior
like instantly essentially,

00:28:22.921 --> 00:28:23.754
for this.

00:28:23.754 --> 00:28:24.721
And that brings up the question,

00:28:24.721 --> 00:28:26.931
do you modify behavior by training people,

00:28:26.931 --> 00:28:28.281
to learn how to behave?

00:28:28.281 --> 00:28:30.843
Or do you just reward good behavior,

00:28:30.843 --> 00:28:32.571
and punish bad behavior?

00:28:32.571 --> 00:28:33.404
- Depends the behavior.

00:28:33.404 --> 00:28:34.237
I'll let you take it.

00:28:34.237 --> 00:28:35.611
- Where are we on that?

00:28:35.611 --> 00:28:38.028
B.F. Skinner was famous for--

00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:41.281
- Well B.F. Skinner's idea was,

00:28:41.281 --> 00:28:43.259
he took it to very far
extreme, behaviorists.

00:28:43.259 --> 00:28:44.310
They all thought that we're all--

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:45.190
- And he did this with his kids.

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:47.051
- He might have yeah.

00:28:47.051 --> 00:28:48.370
- And you have a new born I understand.

00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:49.550
- I do she's three months old.

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:50.531
- There months old.
- And I'm experimenting,

00:28:50.531 --> 00:28:51.611
with her as we speak.

00:28:51.611 --> 00:28:53.121
- Isn't it fun to be
a scientist with kids?

00:28:53.121 --> 00:28:54.910
- Oh it's amazing.

00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:55.743
I like put her in front of the mirror,

00:28:55.743 --> 00:28:57.459
do you recognize yourself yet?

00:28:57.459 --> 00:28:59.709
(laughing)

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:02.627
She's gonna be messed up.

00:29:02.627 --> 00:29:04.950
(laughing)

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:05.783
- Are these the children who write books,

00:29:05.783 --> 00:29:06.616
about their parents,

00:29:06.616 --> 00:29:08.229
when they get older.
- Exactly.

00:29:08.229 --> 00:29:09.459
My mom was the neuroscientist.

00:29:09.459 --> 00:29:10.321
She messed me up.

00:29:10.321 --> 00:29:11.321
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:29:11.321 --> 00:29:13.441
- No, so his idea was that we're born,

00:29:13.441 --> 00:29:14.336
sort of tabula rasa,

00:29:14.336 --> 00:29:15.169
blank slate.

00:29:15.169 --> 00:29:16.657
And you can make anybody into anything,

00:29:16.657 --> 00:29:17.617
just by training,

00:29:17.617 --> 00:29:18.977
by giving them rewards and punishers,

00:29:18.977 --> 00:29:20.567
and modifying their behavior accordingly.

00:29:20.567 --> 00:29:21.805
Well we know now is that,

00:29:21.805 --> 00:29:24.783
we're born with certain
genetic predispositions,

00:29:24.783 --> 00:29:25.825
to behave in certain ways,

00:29:25.825 --> 00:29:27.897
and then within that sort of,

00:29:27.897 --> 00:29:29.607
within that range of,

00:29:29.607 --> 00:29:32.396
you can modify behavior within
a range that you're given,

00:29:32.396 --> 00:29:33.229
biologically.

00:29:33.229 --> 00:29:35.265
So for even something like
intelligence for example,

00:29:35.265 --> 00:29:36.927
you can be born with a
genetic predisposition,

00:29:36.927 --> 00:29:39.167
to be within a certain IQ range.

00:29:39.167 --> 00:29:41.217
Then your environment can
push you sort of towards,

00:29:41.217 --> 00:29:42.097
the top end of the range,

00:29:42.097 --> 00:29:44.255
or maybe towards the
low end of that range.

00:29:44.255 --> 00:29:45.264
But you'll never exceed.

00:29:45.264 --> 00:29:46.385
So it's almost,

00:29:46.385 --> 00:29:47.697
as everyone says,

00:29:47.697 --> 00:29:49.108
it's a combination of both.

00:29:49.108 --> 00:29:51.577
But there's definitely a
lot of learning that occurs.

00:29:51.577 --> 00:29:52.410
And we knowing now,

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:53.604
from mapping out the brain,

00:29:53.604 --> 00:29:55.497
and looking at the genome that,

00:29:55.497 --> 00:29:57.927
what seems to be most
affected by the environment,

00:29:57.927 --> 00:30:00.064
is the way the brain gets wired.

00:30:00.064 --> 00:30:01.956
So you're born with certain
genetic predisposition,

00:30:01.956 --> 00:30:03.465
in terms of the structures of the brain.

00:30:03.465 --> 00:30:04.365
- We got that in another segment.

00:30:04.365 --> 00:30:05.287
But let me just ask you,

00:30:05.287 --> 00:30:06.120
is it,

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.785
can you teach someone math faster,

00:30:08.785 --> 00:30:10.144
by giving them candy,

00:30:10.144 --> 00:30:11.255
than just by teaching them?

00:30:11.255 --> 00:30:13.305
I'm just wondering.
- Yeah, well actually yeah.

00:30:13.305 --> 00:30:14.138
- Or holding them underwater,

00:30:14.138 --> 00:30:14.985
and being like learn it.

00:30:14.985 --> 00:30:16.395
Learn it!

00:30:16.395 --> 00:30:17.228
And then raising,

00:30:17.228 --> 00:30:18.165
waterboarding I guess,

00:30:18.165 --> 00:30:19.144
I'm describing waterboarding.

00:30:19.144 --> 00:30:20.585
(laughing)

00:30:20.585 --> 00:30:21.497
A towel on the face,

00:30:21.497 --> 00:30:22.607
a little bottle of water,

00:30:22.607 --> 00:30:23.440
and some math.

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.690
(laughing)

00:30:27.465 --> 00:30:28.354
- Well we know that people,

00:30:28.354 --> 00:30:31.796
sort of discount delays with reward.

00:30:31.796 --> 00:30:33.585
So if you give someone
a reward right away,

00:30:33.585 --> 00:30:34.817
they'll put more emphasis,

00:30:34.817 --> 00:30:37.457
they'll want that rather
than waiting for it later.

00:30:37.457 --> 00:30:39.036
- Well I think the issue
there is motivation,

00:30:39.036 --> 00:30:40.425
and not necessarily sort of a,

00:30:40.425 --> 00:30:41.875
skill set and a cognitive ability,

00:30:41.875 --> 00:30:43.985
or a technical ability.

00:30:43.985 --> 00:30:45.105
So the fact is yes,

00:30:45.105 --> 00:30:46.217
candy makes everything better,

00:30:46.217 --> 00:30:47.564
no matter what you're trying to learn,

00:30:47.564 --> 00:30:49.145
because it's a very strong motivator,

00:30:49.145 --> 00:30:50.297
and it's a potent motivator.

00:30:50.297 --> 00:30:51.396
- It might not make you better at math,

00:30:51.396 --> 00:30:53.625
but it might make you study for longer,

00:30:53.625 --> 00:30:54.458
for example.

00:30:54.458 --> 00:30:55.291
- And well also, that's a great example--

00:30:55.291 --> 00:30:56.124
- What would cocaine
do for my math skills?

00:30:56.124 --> 00:30:58.374
(laughing)

00:31:04.036 --> 00:31:06.705
- A kid can learn French
in a week on heroine.

00:31:06.705 --> 00:31:08.955
(laughing)

00:31:12.505 --> 00:31:13.815
Now that's a reward.

00:31:13.815 --> 00:31:16.065
(laughing)

00:31:17.255 --> 00:31:18.145
- So okay,

00:31:18.145 --> 00:31:20.255
so a little of both might help, I guess.

00:31:20.255 --> 00:31:21.775
This is the gold star,

00:31:21.775 --> 00:31:23.495
that children get in elementary school.

00:31:23.495 --> 00:31:24.328
Right that's the--

00:31:24.328 --> 00:31:25.815
- I mean it does work to a certain extent.

00:31:25.815 --> 00:31:27.265
As they said, it'll
help motivate behavior,

00:31:27.265 --> 00:31:29.713
but it won't sort of give you a skill set,

00:31:29.713 --> 00:31:31.193
that you don't sort of have--

00:31:31.193 --> 00:31:32.644
- Well I think that also as parents,

00:31:32.644 --> 00:31:33.665
one of the early things we learn,

00:31:33.665 --> 00:31:35.415
when we're talking about
how we discipline children,

00:31:35.415 --> 00:31:37.345
and water boarding joking aside,

00:31:37.345 --> 00:31:39.385
(laughing)

00:31:39.385 --> 00:31:41.015
threats and fear and punishment and pain,

00:31:41.015 --> 00:31:42.764
are very very strong motivators,

00:31:42.764 --> 00:31:43.854
to change behavior.

00:31:43.854 --> 00:31:46.745
The do you want to
condition a child with fear,

00:31:46.745 --> 00:31:47.633
is a much larger question,

00:31:47.633 --> 00:31:49.335
which is probably not funny at all,

00:31:49.335 --> 00:31:50.324
and I won't go into it.

00:31:50.324 --> 00:31:51.775
- [Eugene] Whoops.

00:31:51.775 --> 00:31:54.025
(laughing)

00:31:55.495 --> 00:31:57.695
- There's positive reinforcement
and negative reinforcement.

00:31:57.695 --> 00:31:59.804
There's also taking away of a positive,

00:31:59.804 --> 00:32:01.585
which can be another way
to help somebody learn.

00:32:01.585 --> 00:32:04.231
So there's a whole variety of
ways you can model behavior.

00:32:04.231 --> 00:32:05.064
- I thought of taking away,

00:32:05.064 --> 00:32:06.555
so someone lives with a positive,

00:32:06.555 --> 00:32:08.793
you threaten to take that away.

00:32:08.793 --> 00:32:09.626
- Like a finger.

00:32:09.626 --> 00:32:11.876
(laughing)

00:32:14.082 --> 00:32:15.593
Don't tell me it's not a positive.

00:32:15.593 --> 00:32:17.843
(laughing)

00:32:19.724 --> 00:32:20.557
I don't have a child,

00:32:20.557 --> 00:32:21.390
so it's fine that I'm saying all of this.

00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:23.375
(laughing)

00:32:23.375 --> 00:32:25.175
- I have two children and it's
fine that you're saying this.

00:32:25.175 --> 00:32:27.705
(laughing)

00:32:27.705 --> 00:32:28.945
- One last question
before we take our first,

00:32:28.945 --> 00:32:30.153
by the way our breaks are short,

00:32:30.153 --> 00:32:32.324
they're just to regroup here.

00:32:32.324 --> 00:32:34.151
So on several episodes--

00:32:34.151 --> 00:32:35.789
- It's gonna get crazy
in about 30 seconds.

00:32:35.789 --> 00:32:36.961
(laughing)

00:32:36.961 --> 00:32:39.859
- On the shows you have live,

00:32:39.859 --> 00:32:41.029
rhesus monkeys or something.

00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:42.259
Are there projected in,

00:32:42.259 --> 00:32:43.620
or are they really on the set?

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:44.453
I'm just curious.

00:32:44.453 --> 00:32:45.961
- They're fantasy monkeys
that you have to imagine,

00:32:45.961 --> 00:32:47.652
and it appears on every screen.

00:32:47.652 --> 00:32:49.980
Yeah we have real capuchin monkeys.

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:51.551
- Wow.

00:32:51.551 --> 00:32:53.940
- I'm a vegan, you shouldn't
ask me too much about that.

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:55.401
(laughing)

00:32:55.401 --> 00:32:56.857
Acting monkeys.

00:32:56.857 --> 00:32:57.690
That's what I am,

00:32:57.690 --> 00:32:58.900
I'm just an acting monkey.

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:00.831
(laughing)

00:33:00.831 --> 00:33:02.751
- On Ed you had real Reese's Pieces right,

00:33:02.751 --> 00:33:04.711
at the crafts service table?

00:33:04.711 --> 00:33:06.789
I remember you talking about that.

00:33:06.789 --> 00:33:09.456
- Did they ever try to grab you?

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:14.452
- When we come back on StarTalk Radio,

00:33:14.452 --> 00:33:15.285
more from,

00:33:17.172 --> 00:33:18.870
the Brooklyn Academy of Music,

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:20.052
StarTalk Radio,

00:33:20.052 --> 00:33:21.260
give it up for our panel.

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:25.760
(cheering)
(clapping)

00:33:27.852 --> 00:33:28.852
- Thank you.

00:33:35.351 --> 00:33:37.039
- I want to thank you all for coming.

00:33:37.039 --> 00:33:39.132
We've got two more segments.

00:33:39.132 --> 00:33:40.129
Each is about a half hour,

00:33:40.129 --> 00:33:42.060
and then we're gonna open
the floor to questions.

00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.631
We have a microphone in aisle,

00:33:43.631 --> 00:33:44.860
'cause that's how we roll.

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:45.693
And,

00:33:46.948 --> 00:33:50.593
can I get the house
lights up just briefly.

00:33:50.593 --> 00:33:52.531
There's someone in the audience
I just want to introduce,

00:33:52.531 --> 00:33:53.364
to you all.

00:33:53.364 --> 00:33:54.260
There's a--

00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:55.100
(cheering)

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:57.311
(laughing)

00:33:57.311 --> 00:33:59.561
(cheering)

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:02.801
Bill Nye!

00:34:02.801 --> 00:34:05.051
(cheering)

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:15.444
- [Mayim] He follows me everywhere.

00:34:15.444 --> 00:34:17.121
♪ Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill ♪

00:34:17.121 --> 00:34:18.908

00:34:18.908 --> 00:34:21.212
(upbeat music)

00:34:21.212 --> 00:34:22.539
- [Voiceover] Science rules.

00:34:22.539 --> 00:34:24.459
(upbeat music)

00:34:24.459 --> 00:34:26.671
♪ Bill Nye the Science Guy ♪

00:34:26.671 --> 00:34:28.321

00:34:32.255 --> 00:34:33.550
- Can we get a seat here.

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:36.790
I'm gonna put Bill on the panel.

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:37.623
Why not?

00:34:37.623 --> 00:34:39.932
(cheering)
- He should probably,

00:34:39.932 --> 00:34:41.791
he should go between science and comedy.

00:34:41.791 --> 00:34:44.041
- Right here, there you go.

00:34:45.228 --> 00:34:46.348
How you doin Bill?

00:34:46.348 --> 00:34:47.338
- Fabulously.
- You happened to be,

00:34:47.338 --> 00:34:48.171
in town.

00:34:48.171 --> 00:34:49.004
Thanks for showing up.

00:34:49.004 --> 00:34:49.837
- Oh sorry, let me.

00:34:49.837 --> 00:34:50.670
- He's following me.

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:52.276
We just did Bill Maher together.

00:34:52.276 --> 00:34:53.847
- I'm great Neil, thanks.

00:34:53.847 --> 00:34:55.316
- Yeah there you go.

00:34:55.316 --> 00:34:56.965
Bill Nye the Science Guy.

00:34:56.965 --> 00:34:59.215
(cheering)

00:35:03.063 --> 00:35:05.313
- I think you--
- Thank you.

00:35:09.018 --> 00:35:10.567
- Now Bill,

00:35:10.567 --> 00:35:12.845
you're not actually the person
I was first gonna introduce.

00:35:12.845 --> 00:35:15.058
(laughing)

00:35:15.058 --> 00:35:17.148
Can we bring the lights
back up again please?

00:35:17.148 --> 00:35:19.398
(laughing)

00:35:21.226 --> 00:35:22.935
So we have in the audience--

00:35:22.935 --> 00:35:24.236
(laughing)

00:35:24.236 --> 00:35:26.100
- President Barack Obama.

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:28.466
(laughing)

00:35:28.466 --> 00:35:29.635
- No he doesn't know
he's being introduced.

00:35:29.635 --> 00:35:31.775
He didn't know this but,

00:35:31.775 --> 00:35:32.826
well Phil Larson,

00:35:32.826 --> 00:35:33.746
please stand up where are you?

00:35:33.746 --> 00:35:35.076
- Phil, Phil.

00:35:35.076 --> 00:35:36.043
- Where are you?

00:35:36.043 --> 00:35:36.956
There he goes.

00:35:36.956 --> 00:35:38.404
Phil Larson everyone is,

00:35:38.404 --> 00:35:41.596
(clapping)
(laughing)

00:35:41.596 --> 00:35:43.984
you don't know who he is yet.

00:35:43.984 --> 00:35:45.343
Hold your applause until
you find out who he is.

00:35:45.343 --> 00:35:46.215
He's,

00:35:46.215 --> 00:35:48.465
(laughing)

00:35:49.346 --> 00:35:51.074
- The first person to ever eat a baby.

00:35:51.074 --> 00:35:53.714
(laughing)

00:35:53.714 --> 00:35:56.152
(talking at once)

00:35:56.152 --> 00:35:59.404
- Phil Larson comes to us
from the president's office,

00:35:59.404 --> 00:36:01.615
of Science and Technology Policy.

00:36:01.615 --> 00:36:02.986
So he's representing The White House here,

00:36:02.986 --> 00:36:04.474
at this StarTalk.

00:36:04.474 --> 00:36:07.641
(cheering)
Thank you.

00:36:11.436 --> 00:36:13.263
Thanks Phil for coming.

00:36:13.263 --> 00:36:14.096
Alright.

00:36:16.316 --> 00:36:18.106
Okay the lights can come down,

00:36:18.106 --> 00:36:20.466
and we will begin the second segment.

00:36:20.466 --> 00:36:21.299
Are you ready?

00:36:21.299 --> 00:36:22.915
Okay.

00:36:22.915 --> 00:36:23.748
We are back.

00:36:23.748 --> 00:36:25.666
StarTalk Radio Live at Bam!

00:36:25.666 --> 00:36:27.916
(cheering)

00:36:31.844 --> 00:36:34.094
(clapping)

00:36:35.124 --> 00:36:36.676
And Bill thanks for joining us.

00:36:36.676 --> 00:36:38.335
- Oh no it is I who must thank you.

00:36:38.335 --> 00:36:39.235
No, no.

00:36:39.235 --> 00:36:40.796
(laughing)

00:36:40.796 --> 00:36:42.335
- So,

00:36:42.335 --> 00:36:44.085
we want to take this,

00:36:45.006 --> 00:36:46.473
deeper into the brain.

00:36:46.473 --> 00:36:48.217
We are all neuroscience today.

00:36:48.217 --> 00:36:51.097
What is, Heather, what is consciousness?

00:36:51.097 --> 00:36:53.417
(laughing)

00:36:53.417 --> 00:36:54.744
- We're gonna start easy
and then build it up.

00:36:54.744 --> 00:36:55.577
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,

00:36:55.577 --> 00:36:57.156
what is consciousness?

00:36:57.156 --> 00:36:58.945
- I mean that's a great question.

00:36:58.945 --> 00:36:59.825
- And self awareness.

00:36:59.825 --> 00:37:01.525
- Don't pull any punches.

00:37:01.525 --> 00:37:02.485
Just let us have it.

00:37:02.485 --> 00:37:03.766
(laughing)

00:37:03.766 --> 00:37:05.006
- You know what my biggest question is.

00:37:05.006 --> 00:37:05.839
- Yeah.

00:37:05.839 --> 00:37:08.089
- How come identical twins,

00:37:09.366 --> 00:37:11.916
don't think they are each other?

00:37:11.916 --> 00:37:13.145
- That's your biggest question.

00:37:13.145 --> 00:37:15.824
(laughing)

00:37:15.824 --> 00:37:18.836
- I mean why am I me and not you?

00:37:18.836 --> 00:37:19.669
And we can say,
- Are you high?

00:37:19.669 --> 00:37:20.836
- 'cause we're different people.

00:37:20.836 --> 00:37:22.316
But if you have an identical twin,

00:37:22.316 --> 00:37:24.065
you're the same person but you're not.

00:37:24.065 --> 00:37:26.136
- Just by that much.

00:37:26.136 --> 00:37:27.297
- So what's up with that?

00:37:27.297 --> 00:37:28.583
- First of all, what is consciousness?

00:37:28.583 --> 00:37:30.425
We can define consciousness
very simply as,

00:37:30.425 --> 00:37:32.486
first person subjective experience.

00:37:32.486 --> 00:37:34.296
So you only are aware that you have it.

00:37:34.296 --> 00:37:35.716
I don't know what your
consciousness is like.

00:37:35.716 --> 00:37:37.897
I only know what it is from internally.

00:37:37.897 --> 00:37:39.956
So what is consciousness.

00:37:39.956 --> 00:37:41.045
First person experience.

00:37:41.045 --> 00:37:42.385
How is it tied to the brain?

00:37:42.385 --> 00:37:44.115
We're still trying to figure that out.

00:37:44.115 --> 00:37:46.623
Now that's different than self awareness.

00:37:46.623 --> 00:37:47.795
So you can be conscious,

00:37:47.795 --> 00:37:49.206
without being self aware.

00:37:49.206 --> 00:37:51.245
- Like in a coma, or asleep.

00:37:51.245 --> 00:37:52.078
- Um, yeah--

00:37:52.078 --> 00:37:53.577
- Like my old boss.

00:37:53.577 --> 00:37:55.827
(laughing)

00:37:58.716 --> 00:37:59.634
- There is--

00:37:59.634 --> 00:38:02.526
(laughing)

00:38:02.526 --> 00:38:04.745
- Bill I don't think you ever had a boss.

00:38:04.745 --> 00:38:06.344
- Oh no I used to have a job.

00:38:06.344 --> 00:38:07.566
- Oh you did, okay.

00:38:07.566 --> 00:38:08.956
(laughing)

00:38:08.956 --> 00:38:10.316
- Well so for example babies.

00:38:10.316 --> 00:38:12.905
They can be conscious, meaning
you can have raw sensations,

00:38:12.905 --> 00:38:14.046
like seeing the color red,

00:38:14.046 --> 00:38:16.076
or feeling something soft,

00:38:16.076 --> 00:38:17.465
or smelling a rose,

00:38:17.465 --> 00:38:18.886
without being aware of oneself,

00:38:18.886 --> 00:38:21.676
or having sort meta cognation,

00:38:21.676 --> 00:38:23.154
like thoughts about other thoughts.

00:38:23.154 --> 00:38:24.614
Or I'm the one having these thoughts.

00:38:24.614 --> 00:38:26.726
- So if we're gonna say another
animal is not conscious,

00:38:26.726 --> 00:38:29.025
but has, is not self aware,
but has consciousness,

00:38:29.025 --> 00:38:29.858
- Exactly.

00:38:29.858 --> 00:38:31.774
- The bee finds the flower and,

00:38:31.774 --> 00:38:32.905
nature goes on.

00:38:32.905 --> 00:38:34.916
- Or there are syndromes also
where we see that people,

00:38:34.916 --> 00:38:38.214
have an experience of being conscious,

00:38:38.214 --> 00:38:39.273
of experiencing things,

00:38:39.273 --> 00:38:40.886
in the environment, correct,

00:38:40.886 --> 00:38:42.665
without a notion of
concrete self awareness.

00:38:42.665 --> 00:38:44.766
- Yeah there's certain
dissociative disorders,

00:38:44.766 --> 00:38:46.686
where people loose their sense of self,

00:38:46.686 --> 00:38:48.185
but they're still conscious.

00:38:48.185 --> 00:38:49.756
So consciousness is very unique.

00:38:49.756 --> 00:38:51.884
You don't need to have
necessarily memory for it,

00:38:51.884 --> 00:38:52.836
you don't need to have self awareness.

00:38:52.836 --> 00:38:53.692
You don't even need language.

00:38:53.692 --> 00:38:55.745
- Alec Baldwin in his New Yorker Essay.

00:38:55.745 --> 00:38:57.676
(laughing)

00:38:57.676 --> 00:38:58.985
Seems to be displaying this.

00:38:58.985 --> 00:39:00.673
Is that right Heather?

00:39:00.673 --> 00:39:01.686
- It's an article you read.

00:39:01.686 --> 00:39:02.519
- Yes.

00:39:02.519 --> 00:39:03.352
(laughing)

00:39:03.352 --> 00:39:04.185
I read articles.

00:39:04.185 --> 00:39:05.574
(laughing)

00:39:05.574 --> 00:39:06.934
- You should check out
this one in Life magazine,

00:39:06.934 --> 00:39:09.584
I read about 20 years ago,

00:39:09.584 --> 00:39:11.046
about the terra formation of Mars.

00:39:11.046 --> 00:39:13.166
I'll tell you about it later.

00:39:13.166 --> 00:39:14.086
This was great.

00:39:14.086 --> 00:39:16.036
- So you're saying a baby
could hear Bruce Springsteen,

00:39:16.036 --> 00:39:18.406
but not know why it's having so much fun.

00:39:18.406 --> 00:39:20.656
(laughing)

00:39:24.543 --> 00:39:26.956
- What about lucid dreaming?

00:39:26.956 --> 00:39:28.865
I mean does that?

00:39:28.865 --> 00:39:30.926
- Yeah, so I mean it's just another form--

00:39:30.926 --> 00:39:31.759
(laughing)

00:39:31.759 --> 00:39:32.592
- There we go.

00:39:32.592 --> 00:39:33.486
No, no.

00:39:33.486 --> 00:39:35.319
You fill in the blank.

00:39:37.057 --> 00:39:38.265
- It's another form of awareness.

00:39:38.265 --> 00:39:39.383
Your brain is in a different state.

00:39:39.383 --> 00:39:42.817
Its conscious, but it's in a
different state of awareness.

00:39:42.817 --> 00:39:45.456
- What is lucid dreaming
as opposed to dreaming,

00:39:45.456 --> 00:39:46.972
and you think a lot about it?

00:39:46.972 --> 00:39:48.712
- Lucid dreaming is sort of when,

00:39:48.712 --> 00:39:50.063
some people are able to be in a dream,

00:39:50.063 --> 00:39:52.434
and know that they're themselves dreaming,

00:39:52.434 --> 00:39:54.282
and the can sort of control their dreams.

00:39:54.282 --> 00:39:55.643
- Can I say been there, done that?

00:39:55.643 --> 00:39:56.476
- Oh yeah.

00:39:57.572 --> 00:39:58.514
Was it good?

00:39:58.514 --> 00:39:59.903
- Well,

00:39:59.903 --> 00:40:00.844
it was pretty good for me.

00:40:00.844 --> 00:40:02.981
(laughing)

00:40:02.981 --> 00:40:05.524
For me it was smokin.
- That's awesome.

00:40:05.524 --> 00:40:07.774
(laughing)

00:40:09.874 --> 00:40:10.707
- Wait, wait,

00:40:10.707 --> 00:40:11.540
so a lucid dream,

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:13.592
is a dream that you're
self aware that you're in?

00:40:13.592 --> 00:40:14.844
- Yeah.

00:40:14.844 --> 00:40:16.434
- I have these all the time where I will,

00:40:16.434 --> 00:40:18.474
I often, well I mean I
speak other languages.

00:40:18.474 --> 00:40:19.884
I speak Spanish and I speak Hebrew,

00:40:19.884 --> 00:40:21.092
and I will often have a dream where I'm--

00:40:21.092 --> 00:40:22.394
- Enough Mayim.

00:40:22.394 --> 00:40:24.644
(laughing)

00:40:29.611 --> 00:40:31.194
We get it.

00:40:31.194 --> 00:40:34.143
- Mayim, the PhD wasn't enough apparently.

00:40:34.143 --> 00:40:34.976
- Anyway.

00:40:36.461 --> 00:40:38.462
Sometimes I will be trying
to consciously figure out,

00:40:38.462 --> 00:40:39.623
how to communicate something,

00:40:39.623 --> 00:40:41.372
in my non native tongue.

00:40:41.372 --> 00:40:42.482
I know that I'm having a dream,

00:40:42.482 --> 00:40:43.570
where I'm trying to communicate,

00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:45.690
and I'm literally computing,

00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:46.791
what to say and how to say it,

00:40:46.791 --> 00:40:47.800
and in which tense.

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:50.500
But I'm very aware that this is going on.

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:51.751
- So normally in a dream state,

00:40:51.751 --> 00:40:53.591
the part of the brain called
the prefrontal cortex,

00:40:53.591 --> 00:40:55.170
is sort of down regulated,

00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:56.770
sort of decreased in activation,

00:40:56.770 --> 00:40:59.210
so that you're normally not
so aware of what's going on.

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:00.850
And these subcortical sort of,

00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:04.180
processes are allowed to come through,

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:05.119
without being monitored.

00:41:05.119 --> 00:41:07.178
- The subcortical processes.

00:41:07.178 --> 00:41:08.071
(laughing)

00:41:08.071 --> 00:41:09.420
- There are subcortical
processes that are,

00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:10.253
- Processes.

00:41:10.253 --> 00:41:11.282
- The limbic system,

00:41:11.282 --> 00:41:12.202
the emotional part.

00:41:12.202 --> 00:41:13.726
- The Amygdala.

00:41:13.726 --> 00:41:14.719
- The Amygdala is part of it.

00:41:14.719 --> 00:41:15.552
- Hey!

00:41:15.552 --> 00:41:16.645
(laughing)
- This is the reptile brain.

00:41:16.645 --> 00:41:18.338
- The reptile brain, yeah.

00:41:18.338 --> 00:41:19.359
- The reptile brain.

00:41:19.359 --> 00:41:21.159
- I know the bit I know.

00:41:21.159 --> 00:41:22.718
(laughing)

00:41:22.718 --> 00:41:23.551
- And normally,

00:41:23.551 --> 00:41:25.187
so it's very active in a dream state,

00:41:25.187 --> 00:41:26.247
this reptile brain,

00:41:26.247 --> 00:41:27.687
this limbic emotional brain.

00:41:27.687 --> 00:41:28.749
And the prefrontal cortex--

00:41:28.749 --> 00:41:30.250
- I have erectile brain.

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:31.439
I'm familiar with that.

00:41:31.439 --> 00:41:32.669
(laughing)

00:41:32.669 --> 00:41:33.919
Is that what you said?

00:41:33.919 --> 00:41:34.838
- But in lucid dreams--

00:41:34.838 --> 00:41:35.957
- Reptile brain.

00:41:35.957 --> 00:41:36.949
- Oh!

00:41:36.949 --> 00:41:39.709
- One thing leads to another.

00:41:39.709 --> 00:41:40.749
- In lucid dreaming,

00:41:40.749 --> 00:41:41.788
you can be in a state,

00:41:41.788 --> 00:41:42.767
where you can actually engage,

00:41:42.767 --> 00:41:44.117
the prefrontal cortex a bit more,

00:41:44.117 --> 00:41:45.476
and have some self awareness,

00:41:45.476 --> 00:41:47.237
infuse this dream state.

00:41:47.237 --> 00:41:49.066
- So we see that on an MRI,

00:41:49.066 --> 00:41:50.055
while somebody's asleep.

00:41:50.055 --> 00:41:52.607
Are we able to do that or,

00:41:52.607 --> 00:41:54.897
can you light it up while
someone's unconscious?

00:41:54.897 --> 00:41:56.066
- So there are a lot of
studies, sleep studies,

00:41:56.066 --> 00:41:57.418
which usually don't use MRI,

00:41:57.418 --> 00:41:58.727
'cause you have to put them in a sort of--

00:41:58.727 --> 00:41:59.836
- Dunk, dunk, dunk.

00:41:59.836 --> 00:42:00.669
- That's very loud.

00:42:00.669 --> 00:42:01.874
They can't sleep, exactly.

00:42:01.874 --> 00:42:03.157
It makes a lot of noise.

00:42:03.157 --> 00:42:04.178
So their EEG studies,

00:42:04.178 --> 00:42:06.527
which look at different
sleep states and dreams.

00:42:06.527 --> 00:42:07.360
Yeah.

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:09.027
- And so, with this,

00:42:11.517 --> 00:42:13.345
so you're telling me
asleep you are conscious.

00:42:13.345 --> 00:42:15.143
In a coma, are you conscious?

00:42:15.143 --> 00:42:16.658
- So that's a really interesting question.

00:42:16.658 --> 00:42:18.938
So there's new studies now,

00:42:18.938 --> 00:42:20.687
that are showing there are
certain people who are in a coma,

00:42:20.687 --> 00:42:22.626
you can actually put them in a scanner,

00:42:22.626 --> 00:42:23.727
the one that makes all the loud noise,

00:42:23.727 --> 00:42:24.560
the FMRI,

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:26.178
and you can say to them okay,

00:42:26.178 --> 00:42:27.184
we want you to imagine either,

00:42:27.184 --> 00:42:28.373
say walking through your house,

00:42:28.373 --> 00:42:30.634
or imagine playing a game of tennis.

00:42:30.634 --> 00:42:31.813
Now they can't respond at all.

00:42:31.813 --> 00:42:34.114
And we know what a healthy
person's brain would look like,

00:42:34.114 --> 00:42:35.402
if they're imagining
walking through the house,

00:42:35.402 --> 00:42:37.002
or imagining playing tennis.

00:42:37.002 --> 00:42:38.210
And there's been some cases of people,

00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:39.043
who we think they're in a coma,

00:42:39.043 --> 00:42:40.082
and nothing's getting through,

00:42:40.082 --> 00:42:41.594
but if you just simply
tell them to imagine this,

00:42:41.594 --> 00:42:44.162
their brain lights up in the
right corresponding ways.

00:42:44.162 --> 00:42:45.402
- So hence this story,

00:42:45.402 --> 00:42:46.541
I thought maybe it was just fiction,

00:42:46.541 --> 00:42:48.402
where you can read books
to a person in a coma,

00:42:48.402 --> 00:42:49.969
and they might still be.

00:42:49.969 --> 00:42:51.421
- Yeah and it's not
every person in a coma.

00:42:51.421 --> 00:42:53.962
So I think they did this
with a whole group of people.

00:42:53.962 --> 00:42:54.832
- If you want to head your bets,

00:42:54.832 --> 00:42:55.665
read the book.

00:42:55.665 --> 00:42:56.498
(laughing)

00:42:56.498 --> 00:42:57.730
Read the book.

00:42:57.730 --> 00:42:58.563
- Yeah, just in case.

00:42:58.563 --> 00:42:59.712
But it was maybe like one out of 50,

00:42:59.712 --> 00:43:01.632
they found this person
really was having awareness.

00:43:01.632 --> 00:43:02.465
- Okay.

00:43:03.918 --> 00:43:04.779
- Do those people,

00:43:04.779 --> 00:43:07.339
are those people more likely
to emerge from the coma?

00:43:07.339 --> 00:43:08.172
- Yeah.

00:43:08.172 --> 00:43:09.005
So exactly.

00:43:09.005 --> 00:43:10.796
They now have something called the PCI,

00:43:10.796 --> 00:43:14.355
which I think is called the
Perdibation Complexity Index.

00:43:14.355 --> 00:43:15.188
But basically--

00:43:15.188 --> 00:43:16.021
- [Neil] Yeah that's it.

00:43:16.021 --> 00:43:16.854
- Yeah that's it.

00:43:16.854 --> 00:43:17.765
(laughing)

00:43:17.765 --> 00:43:19.335
What they did was they,

00:43:19.335 --> 00:43:21.667
so what you do is you actually,

00:43:21.667 --> 00:43:24.417
sort of zap a part of
the cortex with a magnet,

00:43:24.417 --> 00:43:25.346
trans cranial,

00:43:25.346 --> 00:43:26.179
- TMS.
- It's TMS.

00:43:26.179 --> 00:43:27.702
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.

00:43:27.702 --> 00:43:28.535
Exactly.

00:43:28.535 --> 00:43:29.540
And you look at,

00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:32.001
if there's a cacophony of
activation and response to that,

00:43:32.001 --> 00:43:33.132
almost if you hit a bell,

00:43:33.132 --> 00:43:34.861
and you hear it ring and it's really loud,

00:43:34.861 --> 00:43:36.273
you know that there's
a lot of connectivity.

00:43:36.273 --> 00:43:38.652
And those people are more
likely to come out of the coma,

00:43:38.652 --> 00:43:40.721
than if you just give them the TMS,

00:43:40.721 --> 00:43:42.982
and the activation only happens locally.

00:43:42.982 --> 00:43:46.092
And do those people ever have memories,

00:43:46.092 --> 00:43:48.121
of their time in the coma.

00:43:48.121 --> 00:43:49.572
- That varies, that varies.

00:43:49.572 --> 00:43:50.405
Some people--

00:43:50.405 --> 00:43:51.782
- And also this is a very
small N we're dealing with.

00:43:51.782 --> 00:43:54.241
To run the stats on this kind of thing,

00:43:54.241 --> 00:43:56.780
you'd have to take so many
people who would qualify,

00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:58.260
for this kind of coma study.

00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:00.481
It's a very small and I wouldn't be,

00:44:00.481 --> 00:44:01.550
sort of making any frame.

00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:02.383
- No obviously,

00:44:02.383 --> 00:44:03.216
- Not you but,

00:44:03.216 --> 00:44:04.049
- Yeah yeah.

00:44:04.049 --> 00:44:04.882
- Other people.
- Please stop bickering.

00:44:04.882 --> 00:44:05.910
(laughing)

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:07.150
- It's a small N.

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:08.680
That's what you said, a small.

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:09.940
(talking at once)

00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:11.050
- Let the record show,

00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:13.460
Mayim said small N,

00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:15.459
meaning small sample size.

00:44:15.459 --> 00:44:16.292
- It's an integer.

00:44:16.292 --> 00:44:17.125
(laughing)

00:44:17.125 --> 00:44:18.670
It's not gonna be a fraction.

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:19.960
It's not gonna be a rational.

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:21.798
It's gonna be an integer.

00:44:21.798 --> 00:44:22.631
- Let me get back to that.

00:44:22.631 --> 00:44:23.464
(laughing)

00:44:23.464 --> 00:44:24.729
- N, that's a tradition in mathematics.

00:44:24.729 --> 00:44:25.562
(laughing)

00:44:25.562 --> 00:44:26.769
We are geeking out here.

00:44:26.769 --> 00:44:29.478
(laughing)

00:44:29.478 --> 00:44:31.169
- So in terms of the brain,

00:44:31.169 --> 00:44:32.300
we tend to think,

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:33.449
well there was the tabula rasa,

00:44:33.449 --> 00:44:34.529
is it,

00:44:34.529 --> 00:44:36.629
you draw it up and then is
it ossified by adulthood.

00:44:36.629 --> 00:44:38.289
But people there were all these ideas,

00:44:38.289 --> 00:44:40.121
hypothesis running around.

00:44:40.121 --> 00:44:42.100
NASA did a study on neuroplasticity,

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:44.020
your brain in space.

00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:45.620
Okay, told you I'd bring it back to space.

00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:47.139
(laughing)

00:44:47.139 --> 00:44:48.500
So they were checking in space,

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:51.841
you are in zero G and so in zero G,

00:44:51.841 --> 00:44:53.060
your,

00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:54.081
(laughing)

00:44:54.081 --> 00:44:55.601
we have interpretive dance,

00:44:55.601 --> 00:44:56.518
for zero G.

00:44:58.086 --> 00:45:00.336
(laughing)

00:45:05.828 --> 00:45:07.396
Bill that did not happen,

00:45:07.396 --> 00:45:08.708
in the movie Gravity,

00:45:08.708 --> 00:45:09.947
people's hair did not stand up on end.

00:45:09.947 --> 00:45:11.316
- Dude I'm so down.

00:45:11.316 --> 00:45:13.148
This is a radio show,

00:45:13.148 --> 00:45:15.468
so I took the hair and
pushed it up straight,

00:45:15.468 --> 00:45:18.886
as though they could have
done with a little hairspray,

00:45:18.886 --> 00:45:20.585
- [Both] in the movie Gravity.

00:45:20.585 --> 00:45:22.158
- [Neil] Yeah they didn't do it.

00:45:22.158 --> 00:45:22.991
Didn't do that.

00:45:22.991 --> 00:45:24.948
- I mean FCOL.

00:45:24.948 --> 00:45:25.781
For crying out loud.

00:45:25.781 --> 00:45:26.614
- Your sense of balance,

00:45:26.614 --> 00:45:29.817
which requires your body's
awareness of gravity,

00:45:29.817 --> 00:45:31.686
a gravity vector.

00:45:31.686 --> 00:45:34.137
Other things, your vision,

00:45:34.137 --> 00:45:36.646
your sense of day and night,

00:45:36.646 --> 00:45:37.756
because in space,

00:45:37.756 --> 00:45:39.297
if you're orbiting Earth,

00:45:39.297 --> 00:45:41.566
the sun rises and sets every 45 minutes.

00:45:41.566 --> 00:45:42.636
So this could totally mess,

00:45:42.636 --> 00:45:43.876
with your rhythms.

00:45:43.876 --> 00:45:45.977
And they did a study.

00:45:45.977 --> 00:45:47.308
And they found out that the brain has,

00:45:47.308 --> 00:45:48.725
plasticity to it,

00:45:49.566 --> 00:45:52.657
where in fact you will
completely adapt to those,

00:45:52.657 --> 00:45:54.876
to those change conditions.

00:45:54.876 --> 00:45:55.796
Not only that,

00:45:55.796 --> 00:45:58.486
the brain builds new brain cells,

00:45:58.486 --> 00:45:59.468
and in some cases,

00:45:59.468 --> 00:46:02.556
permanently responds to this environment.

00:46:02.556 --> 00:46:03.966
And so because of the permanence,

00:46:03.966 --> 00:46:06.417
of some of these plasticity,

00:46:06.417 --> 00:46:08.276
they're suggesting that you should not,

00:46:08.276 --> 00:46:09.428
bring kids into space,

00:46:09.428 --> 00:46:11.385
'cause they don't know what
a permanent change in a kid,

00:46:11.385 --> 00:46:13.366
would be like as an adult.

00:46:13.366 --> 00:46:14.676
- What is it like in an adult?

00:46:14.676 --> 00:46:15.868
What happens in this?

00:46:15.868 --> 00:46:16.836
What is the--

00:46:16.836 --> 00:46:17.937
- You go crazy.

00:46:17.937 --> 00:46:19.326
(laughing)

00:46:19.326 --> 00:46:21.236
- What's the result of
this neuroplasticity?

00:46:21.236 --> 00:46:23.355
- Well I know people have
their eyes change shape.

00:46:23.355 --> 00:46:25.396
Astronauts have had--

00:46:25.396 --> 00:46:27.257
- Like squares, they become a square.

00:46:27.257 --> 00:46:29.507
(laughing)

00:46:31.708 --> 00:46:33.246
- That sounds kind of cool.
- That thing's for making the,

00:46:33.246 --> 00:46:35.148
when you have the hard boiled eggs,

00:46:35.148 --> 00:46:37.155
and you compress them in the refrigerator.

00:46:37.155 --> 00:46:37.988
- Which part of the eye?

00:46:37.988 --> 00:46:39.526
I need you to be more specific.

00:46:39.526 --> 00:46:40.537
Like the whole eye?

00:46:40.537 --> 00:46:41.606
- Guys who go into space,

00:46:41.606 --> 00:46:43.036
with fighter pilot eyes,

00:46:43.036 --> 00:46:45.057
come back and they don't
have very good close up,

00:46:45.057 --> 00:46:45.890
or distance vision.

00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:48.366
They need glasses when
they get back permanently.

00:46:48.366 --> 00:46:50.326
- I'd be careful though when
you say permanent changes,

00:46:50.326 --> 00:46:51.697
because if you're talking
about neuroplasticity,

00:46:51.697 --> 00:46:52.646
if it can change one way,

00:46:52.646 --> 00:46:53.985
it can also change back another way.

00:46:53.985 --> 00:46:56.057
But I think the reason why not to bring,

00:46:56.057 --> 00:46:58.548
developing brains into space or children,

00:46:58.548 --> 00:47:00.626
is because there're critical
periods of development.

00:47:00.626 --> 00:47:03.006
And if they miss certain
stimuli during that,

00:47:03.006 --> 00:47:04.076
critical period,

00:47:04.076 --> 00:47:05.708
then there could be problems.

00:47:05.708 --> 00:47:06.937
- You're talking about
circadian rhythms correct?

00:47:06.937 --> 00:47:08.337
- Among other things yeah.

00:47:08.337 --> 00:47:09.828
- Okay got it.

00:47:09.828 --> 00:47:11.578
So talking about our,

00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:13.653
I don't want to say awareness,

00:47:13.653 --> 00:47:14.689
I mean it with a lower case a.

00:47:14.689 --> 00:47:16.666
Our awareness of day and night,

00:47:16.666 --> 00:47:18.066
you're saying those things can reset,

00:47:18.066 --> 00:47:20.307
so you have a normal body period,

00:47:20.307 --> 00:47:21.518
that is shorter than what it is,

00:47:21.518 --> 00:47:22.619
if you are on Earth.

00:47:22.619 --> 00:47:23.500
- Not quite a 45,

00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:25.318
well it really disrupts your sleep cycle.

00:47:25.318 --> 00:47:26.151
- Sure.

00:47:26.151 --> 00:47:29.465
- And you don't get as deep
a REM sleep in space as--

00:47:29.465 --> 00:47:30.980
- So all of that developmentally would be,

00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:31.868
really really a bad idea.

00:47:31.868 --> 00:47:33.837
- Not to mention like,

00:47:33.837 --> 00:47:36.028
my kids are a pain in the ass,

00:47:36.028 --> 00:47:37.518
on just like an hour and a half flight.

00:47:37.518 --> 00:47:39.768
(laughing)

00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:43.809
Could you imagine sending them to Mars?

00:47:43.809 --> 00:47:45.569
(laughing)

00:47:45.569 --> 00:47:48.116
- I take it you sort of can imagine.

00:47:48.116 --> 00:47:50.117
- You get like Jet Blue
or you at least get,

00:47:50.117 --> 00:47:51.148
some television something,

00:47:51.148 --> 00:47:52.828
back to the seat.

00:47:52.828 --> 00:47:54.420
(laughing)

00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:55.918
- So here's what I wonder Heather.

00:47:55.918 --> 00:47:58.758
If there's this neuroplasticity,

00:47:58.758 --> 00:48:00.540
where your body can adapt to stress,

00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:02.908
in the ways that were measured in space,

00:48:02.908 --> 00:48:05.318
why don't we adapt more on Earth.

00:48:05.318 --> 00:48:07.948
Why do people stress out and
end up in mental hospitals?

00:48:07.948 --> 00:48:09.219
How much--

00:48:09.219 --> 00:48:10.438
- Wait those are two
very different questions.

00:48:10.438 --> 00:48:11.958
(laughing)

00:48:11.958 --> 00:48:13.180
- I thought he was gonna
ask working a night shift.

00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:15.047
Like isn't it hard to work a night shift.

00:48:15.047 --> 00:48:16.700
- Exactly.

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:17.858
- No, no, why are they
two different questions?

00:48:17.858 --> 00:48:19.569
If your brain can adapt,

00:48:19.569 --> 00:48:20.918
with all this plasticity,

00:48:20.918 --> 00:48:23.638
that the neuroscientist are boasting of,

00:48:23.638 --> 00:48:24.540
then why do we have people,

00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:25.900
just freaking out here on Earth?

00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:27.060
(laughing)

00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:28.408
- Well okay, they're two separate things.

00:48:28.408 --> 00:48:29.278
- Tell me why.

00:48:29.278 --> 00:48:30.361
- So, people,

00:48:32.027 --> 00:48:32.860
so this is one thing.

00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:34.198
I went around and actually met people,

00:48:34.198 --> 00:48:35.209
who had extraordinary abilities,

00:48:35.209 --> 00:48:37.088
way outside the norm of
what we think is possible.

00:48:37.088 --> 00:48:38.647
Extraordinary memory and,

00:48:38.647 --> 00:48:39.668
a tolerance to pain.

00:48:39.668 --> 00:48:40.501
All these things.

00:48:40.501 --> 00:48:41.334
So--

00:48:41.334 --> 00:48:42.167
- You hosted a T.V. show on this.

00:48:42.167 --> 00:48:43.308
- There was a T.V., a
Discovery Channel show,

00:48:43.308 --> 00:48:45.209
called Super Human Showdown.

00:48:45.209 --> 00:48:46.220
And there were people who actually,

00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:47.478
we went around the world to find people,

00:48:47.478 --> 00:48:48.796
with these extraordinary abilities.

00:48:48.796 --> 00:48:49.718
One person could hold his breathe,

00:48:49.718 --> 00:48:51.358
under water for 22 minutes.

00:48:51.358 --> 00:48:52.700
And amazing.

00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:53.636
I saw it there.

00:48:53.636 --> 00:48:54.469
- And not be dead.

00:48:54.469 --> 00:48:55.302
- And not be dead.
(laughing)

00:48:55.302 --> 00:48:56.135
He could actually.

00:48:56.135 --> 00:48:57.049
(laughing)

00:48:57.049 --> 00:48:58.500
- Just checking.

00:48:58.500 --> 00:48:59.860
- Could he talk to fish,

00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:00.860
even just a little?

00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:03.598
(laughing)

00:49:03.598 --> 00:49:06.548
- But it's amazing how far we
can actually push ourselves,

00:49:06.548 --> 00:49:07.700
our physiology and our brains.

00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:09.289
So I think a lot of what
people stress about,

00:49:09.289 --> 00:49:10.980
is they think they can't adapt,

00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:12.692
but really we can adapt well beyond,

00:49:12.692 --> 00:49:15.612
what we think we're capable of doing.

00:49:15.612 --> 00:49:17.870
Why people are in mental
institutions is another question.

00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:18.875
I think there are different,

00:49:18.875 --> 00:49:20.960
there's a lot of different
reasons why people,

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:22.300
go insane so to speak.

00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:25.892
But I don't think it's because
of lack of neuroplasticity.

00:49:25.892 --> 00:49:27.521
Does that make sense?
- I support that completely.

00:49:27.521 --> 00:49:28.753
- Okay as my fellow.

00:49:28.753 --> 00:49:29.852
- Yes.

00:49:29.852 --> 00:49:31.380
- Not even people who are super super sad.

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:33.742
(laughing)

00:49:33.742 --> 00:49:35.400
- Is it because of heavy metal music?

00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:37.484
(laughing)

00:49:37.484 --> 00:49:39.281
- That beat, that beat.

00:49:39.281 --> 00:49:40.114
- As I was saying,

00:49:40.114 --> 00:49:42.172
you can modify the brain,

00:49:42.172 --> 00:49:44.422
within certain biological constraints.

00:49:44.422 --> 00:49:45.760
So if you're born with a
certain predisposition,

00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:47.832
or I mean just structural
differences in the brain,

00:49:47.832 --> 00:49:49.672
you can only push it so far.

00:49:49.672 --> 00:49:51.433
But we can definitely go far
beyond what we think we can,

00:49:51.433 --> 00:49:52.679
where we can go.

00:49:52.679 --> 00:49:54.901
- So do you think,

00:49:54.901 --> 00:49:55.921
if we see someone else,

00:49:55.921 --> 00:49:57.342
who has ability,

00:49:57.342 --> 00:50:01.601
and they're human then can we
also try to have that ability?

00:50:01.601 --> 00:50:02.673
- Again it's within a certain,

00:50:02.673 --> 00:50:04.753
so these super human people who I met,

00:50:04.753 --> 00:50:07.492
they all practice a lot of hours,

00:50:07.492 --> 00:50:08.325
dedicate to.

00:50:08.325 --> 00:50:10.302
But they also had certain,

00:50:10.302 --> 00:50:12.302
like the guy who could hold
his breathe under water,

00:50:12.302 --> 00:50:14.081
had a greater lung capacity in general.

00:50:14.081 --> 00:50:15.361
He started out with that,

00:50:15.361 --> 00:50:16.681
and then he pushed it further and further.

00:50:16.681 --> 00:50:17.862
So I think we can all go further,

00:50:17.862 --> 00:50:20.102
within our particular frames.

00:50:20.102 --> 00:50:20.935
- There's this book the sports gene,

00:50:20.935 --> 00:50:23.993
that talks about sort of the
exceptional athletic ability,

00:50:23.993 --> 00:50:25.033
that we don't really think about,

00:50:25.033 --> 00:50:26.132
when we see Olympic athletes.

00:50:26.132 --> 00:50:28.033
They're at a whole different
physiological level,

00:50:28.033 --> 00:50:30.372
than we even would think about.

00:50:30.372 --> 00:50:31.593
We would think oh,

00:50:31.593 --> 00:50:32.572
Michael Phelps is a great swimmer.

00:50:32.572 --> 00:50:34.982
No, his arms are really really long.

00:50:34.982 --> 00:50:37.092
His feet are practically webbed.

00:50:37.092 --> 00:50:38.620
His body is different than ours.

00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:39.553
(laughing)

00:50:39.553 --> 00:50:40.713
- He's a monster.

00:50:40.713 --> 00:50:43.142
(laughing)

00:50:43.142 --> 00:50:43.975
- It's weird.

00:50:43.975 --> 00:50:46.241
When you watch swimmers
at that high level,

00:50:46.241 --> 00:50:47.724
they go about twice as fast,

00:50:47.724 --> 00:50:50.872
as a normal person swimming.

00:50:50.872 --> 00:50:52.302
- I could swim all day.

00:50:52.302 --> 00:50:53.283
I'll never look like that,

00:50:53.283 --> 00:50:55.532
because I was not born with
a genetic predisposition,

00:50:55.532 --> 00:50:56.700
to have really long arms,

00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:57.593
and webbed feet.

00:50:57.593 --> 00:50:59.073
(laughing)

00:50:59.073 --> 00:50:59.953
- I think you look great.

00:50:59.953 --> 00:51:01.364
Doesn't she look great everybody.

00:51:01.364 --> 00:51:02.564
(laughing)

00:51:02.564 --> 00:51:03.397
That's really what matters.

00:51:03.397 --> 00:51:04.230
I have a question,

00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:06.284
but on a more pedestrian level,

00:51:06.284 --> 00:51:07.422
talking about sports.

00:51:07.422 --> 00:51:08.830
You see certain populations,

00:51:08.830 --> 00:51:10.450
like people from the Dominican Republic,

00:51:10.450 --> 00:51:11.330
which is such a small country,

00:51:11.330 --> 00:51:13.882
but have a large proportion of people,

00:51:13.882 --> 00:51:15.404
entering the major leagues of baseball.

00:51:15.404 --> 00:51:16.801
Is it because they,

00:51:16.801 --> 00:51:18.692
they have peer groups--

00:51:18.692 --> 00:51:20.092
- This is such a dangerous question,

00:51:20.092 --> 00:51:21.651
we know you're about to ask.

00:51:21.651 --> 00:51:22.924
It's so dangerous.
- 'Cause you're gonna,

00:51:22.924 --> 00:51:25.142
change it to synagogue.

00:51:25.142 --> 00:51:26.313
- I was not going into racism,

00:51:26.313 --> 00:51:27.561
although I will if you want me to.

00:51:27.561 --> 00:51:29.273
(laughing)

00:51:29.273 --> 00:51:31.481
No it was about something
somebody else asked,

00:51:31.481 --> 00:51:33.572
about observing other people,

00:51:33.572 --> 00:51:34.652
in peer groups,

00:51:34.652 --> 00:51:36.170
ascending to higher levels,

00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:38.902
and therefore seeing first
hand what's possible,

00:51:38.902 --> 00:51:41.342
does that make you more
susceptible to those possibilities?

00:51:41.342 --> 00:51:42.233
- I think that's, I mean,

00:51:42.233 --> 00:51:43.610
you want it, or do you want me to take it?

00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:44.443
- You can go.

00:51:44.443 --> 00:51:45.276
You go for it.

00:51:45.276 --> 00:51:46.273
(laughing)
- You can take this.

00:51:46.273 --> 00:51:48.319
- I think to keep it simple,

00:51:48.319 --> 00:51:49.313
we're gonna just keep it simple,

00:51:49.313 --> 00:51:51.921
and say that's a huge sociological,

00:51:51.921 --> 00:51:55.301
environmental behavioral
sort of influence.

00:51:55.301 --> 00:51:56.134
But I don't know.

00:51:56.134 --> 00:51:57.129
- I know, I'm writing
my dissertation on it.

00:51:57.129 --> 00:51:58.302
(laughing)

00:51:58.302 --> 00:51:59.135
- I'm sorry.

00:51:59.135 --> 00:52:00.718
Now it's your turn.

00:52:01.732 --> 00:52:02.582
- Well I just think--

00:52:02.582 --> 00:52:03.415
- Well Heather,

00:52:03.415 --> 00:52:04.282
have they found a gene for baseball?

00:52:04.282 --> 00:52:06.551
That's really what he's asking.

00:52:06.551 --> 00:52:09.602
- You're born with certain
genetic predispositions,

00:52:09.602 --> 00:52:12.130
towards maybe better athletic prowess.

00:52:12.130 --> 00:52:13.273
But it gets dangerous--

00:52:13.273 --> 00:52:14.851
- Different distribution of muscle fibers,

00:52:14.851 --> 00:52:16.033
for example in runners.

00:52:16.033 --> 00:52:17.443
- I think what the reason
people are getting sort of,

00:52:17.443 --> 00:52:19.382
the thing we're dancing around,

00:52:19.382 --> 00:52:20.660
it can be very controversial.

00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:21.812
There was a book written,

00:52:21.812 --> 00:52:22.993
called, "The Bell Curve" for example,

00:52:22.993 --> 00:52:24.011
about intelligence.

00:52:24.011 --> 00:52:25.172
And it said okay you know,

00:52:25.172 --> 00:52:26.772
we did this whole study
and looked at populations,

00:52:26.772 --> 00:52:29.404
in X number of people from a
certain type of background,

00:52:29.404 --> 00:52:31.252
have the highest IQ and others don't.

00:52:31.252 --> 00:52:32.593
It really can lead to--

00:52:32.593 --> 00:52:33.426
- Ashkenazi Jews.

00:52:33.426 --> 00:52:35.681
- Well it's happened to be
Ashkenazi Jews, what it was.

00:52:35.681 --> 00:52:36.580
(laughing)

00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:37.513
- Who has the highest IQ.

00:52:37.513 --> 00:52:38.572
- [Heather] Yeah.

00:52:38.572 --> 00:52:39.551
- Yeah!

00:52:39.551 --> 00:52:41.142
(laughing)

00:52:41.142 --> 00:52:42.272
- Wait, wait me too.

00:52:42.272 --> 00:52:44.522
(laughing)

00:52:46.652 --> 00:52:47.485
- Let the record show,

00:52:47.485 --> 00:52:49.532
(laughing)

00:52:49.532 --> 00:52:52.332
let the record show Dr. T.

00:52:52.332 --> 00:52:53.915
I did what I could.

00:52:54.942 --> 00:52:57.993
I did what I could to slip
in a joke about synagogues.

00:52:57.993 --> 00:52:59.273
(laughing)

00:52:59.273 --> 00:53:02.313
And the major league baseball
players that they produce.

00:53:02.313 --> 00:53:03.164
- Is that where you were going with that?

00:53:03.164 --> 00:53:04.302
- That's where I was going,

00:53:04.302 --> 00:53:08.033
because another factor as a baseball fan,

00:53:08.033 --> 00:53:10.513
another very strong
motivator in those countries,

00:53:10.513 --> 00:53:13.582
is this you can play baseball all year.

00:53:13.582 --> 00:53:15.843
And I was just in
Minneapolis this morning.

00:53:15.843 --> 00:53:17.484
It would be very challenging.

00:53:17.484 --> 00:53:19.284
That's 'cause the snow is white,

00:53:19.284 --> 00:53:20.571
the ball is white.

00:53:20.571 --> 00:53:21.404
It's hard.

00:53:21.404 --> 00:53:23.652
(laughing)

00:53:23.652 --> 00:53:25.672
And then you also have the--
- that was being racist.

00:53:25.672 --> 00:53:28.636
(laughing)

00:53:28.636 --> 00:53:31.121
- You also have this
extraordinary motivation of money.

00:53:31.121 --> 00:53:32.490
You can make it in the big leagues.

00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:36.657
And have you ever seen the
World Baseball Classic?

00:53:39.601 --> 00:53:41.241
- Yeah, yeah.

00:53:41.241 --> 00:53:43.292
It's mostly Latin America.

00:53:43.292 --> 00:53:44.932
- Extraordinary players,

00:53:44.932 --> 00:53:46.671
just extraordinary players.

00:53:46.671 --> 00:53:48.953
But it's one more click
to hit it that hard.

00:53:48.953 --> 00:53:49.786
- I'd like to change the topic,

00:53:49.786 --> 00:53:50.920
(laughing)

00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:51.753
to anything.

00:53:51.753 --> 00:53:52.652
- To ice hockey?

00:53:52.652 --> 00:53:54.452
- I want to know about sleep.

00:53:54.452 --> 00:53:55.932
- Let's talk about eugenics for a minute.

00:53:55.932 --> 00:53:58.182
(laughing)

00:54:02.633 --> 00:54:04.132
- Why is it that people from Boston,

00:54:04.132 --> 00:54:05.433
are just so soft?

00:54:05.433 --> 00:54:06.833
(laughing)

00:54:06.833 --> 00:54:09.172
Their face is just a soft beautiful face.

00:54:09.172 --> 00:54:11.422
(laughing)

00:54:12.649 --> 00:54:14.310
- So Heather I want to talk about sleep,

00:54:14.310 --> 00:54:15.393
for a moment.

00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:18.150
Why the hell do we have to sleep?

00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:19.321
What a waste of time that is,

00:54:19.321 --> 00:54:20.154
I think to myself.

00:54:20.154 --> 00:54:21.769
- Did you just say why the
hell do we have to sleep?

00:54:21.769 --> 00:54:22.761
(laughing)
- Yes!

00:54:22.761 --> 00:54:25.740
- We could be literally
learning karate instead.

00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:26.573
(laughing)
- No, I'm just saying,

00:54:26.573 --> 00:54:27.407
(laughing)

00:54:27.407 --> 00:54:28.513
- Every time I sleep I'm like,

00:54:28.513 --> 00:54:30.060
I should be learning karate.

00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:31.348
- I'm reading, I'm learning,

00:54:31.348 --> 00:54:32.181
I'm having fun.

00:54:32.181 --> 00:54:33.129
I say damn, I got to go to sleep,

00:54:33.129 --> 00:54:35.900
be semi comatose for the next eight hours.

00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:37.408
If an alien came to Earth,

00:54:37.408 --> 00:54:39.260
and you're having a great conversation.

00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:40.209
But then say, excuse me,

00:54:40.209 --> 00:54:43.110
I have to lay semi comatose
for the next eight hours.

00:54:43.110 --> 00:54:44.201
I'll get back to you.

00:54:44.201 --> 00:54:46.049
They'll wonder what's wrong with you.

00:54:46.049 --> 00:54:47.201
(laughing)

00:54:47.201 --> 00:54:48.521
- Maybe they go down 16.

00:54:48.521 --> 00:54:49.418
You don't know.

00:54:49.418 --> 00:54:50.361
- Oh I know, maybe.

00:54:50.361 --> 00:54:51.230
- Like a baby.

00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:52.630
- Why do we sleep?

00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:54.990
- The latest theory that we think,

00:54:54.990 --> 00:54:56.670
that most of the neuro
scientific evidence,

00:54:56.670 --> 00:54:57.503
is pointing towards,

00:54:57.503 --> 00:54:59.887
is the way the brain sort
of cleaning itself out.

00:54:59.887 --> 00:55:00.769
So during the day,

00:55:00.769 --> 00:55:02.379
you're taking in all this stimulation,

00:55:02.379 --> 00:55:04.929
and it's almost impossible
for your brain to,

00:55:04.929 --> 00:55:06.240
integrate all of it everyday.

00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:07.310
It would be cluttered.

00:55:07.310 --> 00:55:08.143
So at night what happens,

00:55:08.143 --> 00:55:09.361
is there's sort of a pruning.

00:55:09.361 --> 00:55:11.220
It solidifies the information,

00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:12.500
that it wants to kind of keep,

00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:13.529
and reinforces--

00:55:13.529 --> 00:55:15.140
- Whether or not it's accurate
or correct or anything.

00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:16.618
- Well yeah it depends.

00:55:16.618 --> 00:55:17.641
That's psychopath.

00:55:17.641 --> 00:55:19.640
(laughing)

00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:20.619
- I just had an example.

00:55:20.619 --> 00:55:22.190
(laughing)

00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:24.081
- There's sort of pruning that happens.

00:55:24.081 --> 00:55:26.860
And so without this cleaning out process,

00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:29.230
they looked at people when
you deprive them of sleep,

00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:30.430
and it causes all sorts of problems,

00:55:30.430 --> 00:55:32.777
including it can relate to
things like Alzheimer's.

00:55:32.777 --> 00:55:35.260
Because the plagues and
tangles that form actually,

00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:37.099
that sleep is a kind of way that helps,

00:55:37.099 --> 00:55:38.140
clear out those plagues,

00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:39.849
well things that could potentially form,

00:55:39.849 --> 00:55:40.879
the proteins that conform those.

00:55:40.879 --> 00:55:42.178
- So you're saying people
who don't get as much as--

00:55:42.178 --> 00:55:43.011
- No, well no.

00:55:43.011 --> 00:55:44.409
- I knew you were gonna say that.

00:55:44.409 --> 00:55:45.560
- I'm just asking.

00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:48.140
- To be clear, she's saying
people with Alzheimer's,

00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:50.110
are simply extremely sleepy.

00:55:50.110 --> 00:55:52.360
(laughing)

00:55:55.870 --> 00:55:57.761
- What conclusion are we to draw?

00:55:57.761 --> 00:56:00.247
- If you're sleepy, you're
gonna get Alzheimer's.

00:56:00.247 --> 00:56:01.550
(laughing)

00:56:01.550 --> 00:56:02.510
- That's how science works.

00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:04.760
(laughing)

00:56:06.308 --> 00:56:07.141
- So remember,

00:56:07.141 --> 00:56:07.974
play baseball.

00:56:07.974 --> 00:56:10.230
(laughing)

00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:11.769
- It's complicated.

00:56:11.769 --> 00:56:12.940
- Alright so?

00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:14.540
- Well like for memories for example,

00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:16.287
if you're studying for an exam actually,

00:56:16.287 --> 00:56:17.601
you'll do better if you
get a good night's sleep.

00:56:17.601 --> 00:56:19.620
It's not good to just cram
the whole night before,

00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:22.089
because the brain can then
solidify the associations,

00:56:22.089 --> 00:56:22.990
that were made,

00:56:22.990 --> 00:56:25.310
and get rid of the nonsense and the noise.

00:56:25.310 --> 00:56:27.180
- Alright so,

00:56:27.180 --> 00:56:28.938
but some people sleep five hours,

00:56:28.938 --> 00:56:30.220
others nine.

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:32.809
Should the five hour
person be sleeping more,

00:56:32.809 --> 00:56:34.829
or the nine hour person be sleeping less?

00:56:34.829 --> 00:56:35.870
- That is hard to say.

00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:37.820
There's no, I don't think
there's an exact number on it.

00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:39.569
I mean people, there's a
lot of things out there,

00:56:39.569 --> 00:56:41.481
that say you should get X
number of hours of sleep.

00:56:41.481 --> 00:56:42.841
But really everybody's different.

00:56:42.841 --> 00:56:44.540
Some people just don't
need that much sleep.

00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:45.409
- I don't get a lot of sleep.

00:56:45.409 --> 00:56:46.321
My feeling is if I'm,

00:56:46.321 --> 00:56:48.649
if in general we are
productive, functional,

00:56:48.649 --> 00:56:49.940
getting the things done
that we want to get done,

00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:52.241
there's gonna be some
variability for sure.

00:56:52.241 --> 00:56:54.340
- Okay so also if you don't get sleep,

00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:55.761
that's like a form of torture right.

00:56:55.761 --> 00:56:56.640
Your brain goes crazy.

00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:59.289
- What happens is people
start to hallucinate yeah.

00:56:59.289 --> 00:57:00.978
They start to sort of,

00:57:00.978 --> 00:57:03.400
because again, the brain isn't
able to properly prune out.

00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:05.441
And all the information
can get kind of jumbled.

00:57:05.441 --> 00:57:07.481
- Also if you disrupt REM sleep.

00:57:07.481 --> 00:57:08.314
- Exactly.

00:57:08.314 --> 00:57:09.147
- [Paul] But it is--

00:57:09.147 --> 00:57:10.001
- REM sleep is where
a lot of that happens.

00:57:10.001 --> 00:57:11.100
- It is an individual thing,

00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:12.670
because you have people like Edison or,

00:57:12.670 --> 00:57:14.580
Winston Churchill or these,

00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:15.841
high functioning people,

00:57:15.841 --> 00:57:17.169
who slept for four hours a night,

00:57:17.169 --> 00:57:18.356
or two hours a night.

00:57:18.356 --> 00:57:19.208
- There's actually an extraordinary,

00:57:19.208 --> 00:57:20.189
a large number of people.

00:57:20.189 --> 00:57:21.470
Bill Clinton is another one,

00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:23.348
Margaret Thatcher, they would
only sleep very few hours,

00:57:23.348 --> 00:57:25.676
but then they would take these
power naps during the day.

00:57:25.676 --> 00:57:27.539
And there could be something to that.

00:57:27.539 --> 00:57:29.749
But they all said they at
least they take those little,

00:57:29.749 --> 00:57:31.179
mini naps.

00:57:31.179 --> 00:57:33.857
And that maybe the brain
can sort of revamp itself.

00:57:33.857 --> 00:57:34.888
- They also have a giant staff,

00:57:34.888 --> 00:57:36.168
and many assistants and chefs.

00:57:36.168 --> 00:57:37.408
(laughing)

00:57:37.408 --> 00:57:38.526
- Are you describing mini naps,

00:57:38.526 --> 00:57:42.238
or hooking up periodically
with people throughout the day?

00:57:42.238 --> 00:57:43.167
Both sound relaxing.

00:57:43.167 --> 00:57:44.838
(laughing)

00:57:44.838 --> 00:57:45.671
- Depends on the people.

00:57:45.671 --> 00:57:47.185
(laughing)

00:57:47.185 --> 00:57:48.018
- So what they found was that,

00:57:48.018 --> 00:57:51.219
the REM sleep was disrupted
by astronauts who,

00:57:51.219 --> 00:57:53.586
in orbit see sunrise,
sunset every 45 minutes.

00:57:53.586 --> 00:57:55.147
They couldn't get their rhythms going.

00:57:55.147 --> 00:57:57.387
- They could just pull down
the shades couldn't they.

00:57:57.387 --> 00:57:58.227
- I would've thought.

00:57:58.227 --> 00:57:59.625
I would've thought.

00:57:59.625 --> 00:58:01.578
- Those masks that cover your eyes.

00:58:01.578 --> 00:58:03.008
- Yeah I would've thought.

00:58:03.008 --> 00:58:04.037
You'd think.

00:58:04.037 --> 00:58:06.357
- Well it's all coach
class, that's the thing.

00:58:06.357 --> 00:58:09.416
(laughing)

00:58:09.416 --> 00:58:11.246
- It doesn't come with a little thing.

00:58:11.246 --> 00:58:13.707
- Yeah they don't give
you the little pouch.

00:58:13.707 --> 00:58:15.038
- You're telling me they
flew the space shuttle,

00:58:15.038 --> 00:58:15.918
coach class,

00:58:15.918 --> 00:58:17.027
(laughing)

00:58:17.027 --> 00:58:18.296
and they didn't get the little eye covers.

00:58:18.296 --> 00:58:19.526
- But studies show that
if you deprive people,

00:58:19.526 --> 00:58:21.116
particularly of REM sleep,

00:58:21.116 --> 00:58:22.638
that they have to make up for it later on,

00:58:22.638 --> 00:58:24.774
so that they'll have
more hours of REM sleep,

00:58:24.774 --> 00:58:26.987
when you allow them to sleep later.

00:58:26.987 --> 00:58:29.606
- Okay so this is a feature
of our human species,

00:58:29.606 --> 00:58:31.939
not a failure of our design?

00:58:33.838 --> 00:58:35.357
- Yeah I mean if there was,

00:58:35.357 --> 00:58:36.286
if we could design it better,

00:58:36.286 --> 00:58:37.438
without sleep, that'd be great.

00:58:37.438 --> 00:58:38.616
But so far it's the--

00:58:38.616 --> 00:58:39.478
- But it's all species right?

00:58:39.478 --> 00:58:42.255
There's no species that
does not need sleep.

00:58:42.255 --> 00:58:43.088
- I don't know that.

00:58:43.088 --> 00:58:43.921
I don't know.

00:58:43.921 --> 00:58:45.088
- Sea Jellies.

00:58:45.998 --> 00:58:47.336
Squid.

00:58:47.336 --> 00:58:48.169
- Algae.

00:58:48.169 --> 00:58:49.587
- Fish.

00:58:49.587 --> 00:58:51.734
- There are low metabolic
periods I would say,

00:58:51.734 --> 00:58:53.736
for all sorts of vertebrates
yes, I mean at least.

00:58:53.736 --> 00:58:54.646
- Yeah, yeah.

00:58:54.646 --> 00:58:55.479
- And no well,
- There's always,

00:58:55.479 --> 00:58:56.312
a rest period.

00:58:56.312 --> 00:58:58.086
There's a rest period, even if
it's not what we call sleep.

00:58:58.086 --> 00:58:58.919
There is a rest period.

00:58:58.919 --> 00:59:00.376
- But from an evolutionary standpoint,

00:59:00.376 --> 00:59:01.686
one could ask,

00:59:01.686 --> 00:59:05.056
if it's a big advantage
to need less sleep,

00:59:05.056 --> 00:59:06.878
would these people be more successful,

00:59:06.878 --> 00:59:08.414
become captains of industry,

00:59:08.414 --> 00:59:10.147
and get extraordinarily wealthy.

00:59:10.147 --> 00:59:10.980
- Well there must be something,

00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:13.224
well the answer is there must
be something advantageous,

00:59:13.224 --> 00:59:15.584
I.E. incorporating a tremendous amount,

00:59:15.584 --> 00:59:16.646
of input from the day,

00:59:16.646 --> 00:59:17.854
that can then help you make,

00:59:17.854 --> 00:59:19.164
different kinds of decisions,

00:59:19.164 --> 00:59:20.944
more complicated decisions correct?

00:59:20.944 --> 00:59:21.886
- Yeah.
- The next day.

00:59:21.886 --> 00:59:23.595
- Well I see, so the digested information,

00:59:23.595 --> 00:59:24.724
has more value to you,

00:59:24.724 --> 00:59:25.664
the day after,

00:59:25.664 --> 00:59:27.143
as it's for your survival.

00:59:27.143 --> 00:59:28.854
- If that were
evolutionarily advantageous.

00:59:28.854 --> 00:59:29.687
That's why it,
- I got that.

00:59:29.687 --> 00:59:30.675
That's a good one.
- Would be retained.

00:59:30.675 --> 00:59:31.508
Thank you.

00:59:31.508 --> 00:59:32.492
- But there's some animal,

00:59:32.492 --> 00:59:34.046
I think there's maybe it's dolphins,

00:59:34.046 --> 00:59:35.062
there's some animals that,

00:59:35.062 --> 00:59:36.264
sleep with only half their brain.

00:59:36.264 --> 00:59:37.344
And the other half is alert.

00:59:37.344 --> 00:59:38.584
It's dolphins.

00:59:38.584 --> 00:59:40.946
Part of them is aware for any sort of,

00:59:40.946 --> 00:59:42.695
let's say predator is coming.

00:59:42.695 --> 00:59:43.528
- [Eugene] Samurai.

00:59:43.528 --> 00:59:45.778
(laughing)

00:59:48.495 --> 00:59:50.154
- The people who sleep
with their guns and swords.

00:59:50.154 --> 00:59:51.152
(laughing)

00:59:51.152 --> 00:59:52.545
- Samurai bears.

00:59:52.545 --> 00:59:54.795
(laughing)

00:59:55.684 --> 00:59:57.935
- And is it true lions
sleep 20 hours a day,

00:59:57.935 --> 00:59:59.423
or something like that.

00:59:59.423 --> 01:00:00.256
- I don't--

01:00:00.256 --> 01:00:01.089
- Yeah is that true Heather?

01:00:01.089 --> 01:00:02.735
(laughing)

01:00:02.735 --> 01:00:04.476
- I don't know everything
about everything.

01:00:04.476 --> 01:00:05.924
- You're a cognitive neuroscientist.

01:00:05.924 --> 01:00:07.204
Do lions sleep 20 hours a day?

01:00:07.204 --> 01:00:09.524
(laughing)

01:00:09.524 --> 01:00:10.357
- They do.

01:00:11.304 --> 01:00:13.322
They sleep for 20 hours a day.

01:00:13.322 --> 01:00:14.604
- [Heather] Was that in Time magazine?

01:00:14.604 --> 01:00:16.186
- No I--

01:00:16.186 --> 01:00:17.663
- You went to the zoo with your kids.

01:00:17.663 --> 01:00:19.964
- No, I went on safari once.

01:00:19.964 --> 01:00:20.797
It's true.

01:00:22.415 --> 01:00:23.715
And I remember learning that.

01:00:23.715 --> 01:00:25.965
(laughing)

01:00:27.044 --> 01:00:29.034
And by the way,

01:00:29.034 --> 01:00:30.975
the females do all of the hunting.

01:00:30.975 --> 01:00:33.644
And then the male lions just
go in and then eat first.

01:00:33.644 --> 01:00:34.516
Swat away the kids,

01:00:34.516 --> 01:00:35.884
then they go back to sleep.

01:00:35.884 --> 01:00:37.076
(laughing)

01:00:37.076 --> 01:00:38.123
- Yeah yeah it's just sleep.

01:00:38.123 --> 01:00:39.164
- So they're called,

01:00:39.164 --> 01:00:40.084
and if there's a bunch of em,

01:00:40.084 --> 01:00:41.244
they're called a pride.

01:00:41.244 --> 01:00:42.077
- Wow.

01:00:42.077 --> 01:00:44.236
(laughing)

01:00:44.236 --> 01:00:45.356
- A pride of lions.

01:00:45.356 --> 01:00:47.606
(laughing)

01:00:48.524 --> 01:00:50.024
- Murder of crows.

01:00:51.095 --> 01:00:52.255
- Boring of panelists.

01:00:52.255 --> 01:00:54.505
(laughing)

01:00:58.156 --> 01:01:00.239
- A smack of sea jellies.

01:01:02.036 --> 01:01:04.378
- So Mayim how much of--

01:01:04.378 --> 01:01:05.776
- That sound is disturbing to any,

01:01:05.776 --> 01:01:06.738
oh just to the nerds?

01:01:06.738 --> 01:01:07.571
- We can all hear it,

01:01:07.571 --> 01:01:08.506
so we're all fine.

01:01:08.506 --> 01:01:09.576
(laughing)

01:01:09.576 --> 01:01:11.666
I believe it is feedback.

01:01:11.666 --> 01:01:13.666
- There is a high frequency
sound entered our ear pieces,

01:01:13.666 --> 01:01:14.676
moments ago.

01:01:14.676 --> 01:01:16.945
So Mayim how much sleep
do you get a night?

01:01:16.945 --> 01:01:19.727
- I actually, I'm like a
five or six hour person.

01:01:19.727 --> 01:01:22.056
- As am I, I'm like five
and half hours exactly.

01:01:22.056 --> 01:01:23.767
And I nap some on the weekend.

01:01:23.767 --> 01:01:25.236
But during the week it's
five and half hours.

01:01:25.236 --> 01:01:27.746
- I take a Saturday, a Shabbat
nap for about 20 minutes.

01:01:27.746 --> 01:01:28.826
(laughing)

01:01:28.826 --> 01:01:29.986
I give my kids a cookie,

01:01:29.986 --> 01:01:31.445
and I say I will be a much better mother,

01:01:31.445 --> 01:01:32.797
if I can sleep for 20 minutes,

01:01:32.797 --> 01:01:34.098
on this couch with ear plugs in,

01:01:34.098 --> 01:01:34.931
I promise.

01:01:34.931 --> 01:01:35.764
(laughing)

01:01:35.764 --> 01:01:36.738
- And how old are your kids?

01:01:36.738 --> 01:01:37.984
- Five and half and eight.

01:01:37.984 --> 01:01:38.978
- Whoa, yeah.

01:01:38.978 --> 01:01:41.306
So presumably when they were much younger,

01:01:41.306 --> 01:01:42.346
you get no sleep.

01:01:42.346 --> 01:01:45.864
- Well, yeah, I mean
honestly it's amazing to see,

01:01:45.864 --> 01:01:47.709
what it's like with a newborn.

01:01:47.709 --> 01:01:48.919
I was a breastfeeding mom,

01:01:48.919 --> 01:01:50.645
and I was up literally every two hours,

01:01:50.645 --> 01:01:52.589
for about four or five years,

01:01:52.589 --> 01:01:53.607
literally every two hours.

01:01:53.607 --> 01:01:55.108
- Did you study yourself at that point?

01:01:55.108 --> 01:01:57.669
- I wrote my thesis while
breastfeeding my older one.

01:01:57.669 --> 01:01:59.627
I literally laying down
nursing and typing.

01:01:59.627 --> 01:02:03.206
I was data analysis and
writing and editing my thesis,

01:02:03.206 --> 01:02:04.226
with my first son.

01:02:04.226 --> 01:02:07.393
And yeah, it's amazing to sleep again.

01:02:08.258 --> 01:02:09.238
- And she knows three languages.

01:02:09.238 --> 01:02:11.777
(laughing)

01:02:11.777 --> 01:02:13.167
- Totally impressed.

01:02:13.167 --> 01:02:14.879
(laughing)

01:02:14.879 --> 01:02:17.257
- Just get, so five and half,

01:02:17.257 --> 01:02:18.429
how many hours of sleep for you?

01:02:18.429 --> 01:02:20.698
- Now I have a three month old so,

01:02:20.698 --> 01:02:22.138
and I'm breastfeeding so it's like--

01:02:22.138 --> 01:02:23.309
- This is her most
restful part of the day.

01:02:23.309 --> 01:02:24.949
- I'm sleeping right now actually.

01:02:24.949 --> 01:02:26.378
(laughing)

01:02:26.378 --> 01:02:27.211
- Half your brain.

01:02:27.211 --> 01:02:28.628
You're a dolphin.

01:02:29.527 --> 01:02:30.360
She's a dolphin.

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:31.477
- Bill?

01:02:31.477 --> 01:02:33.109
- I need seven and half.

01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:36.399
Furthermore, I claim I'm
skilled at the power nap.

01:02:36.399 --> 01:02:37.645
I put in the hours.

01:02:37.645 --> 01:02:40.218
I put in the third of an
hours on the power nap.

01:02:40.218 --> 01:02:41.837
- [Neil] Power nap, Paul.

01:02:41.837 --> 01:02:43.085
- It really varies.

01:02:43.085 --> 01:02:45.909
I guess probably about six or seven.

01:02:45.909 --> 01:02:47.098
Although it seems now,

01:02:47.098 --> 01:02:49.138
I am falling asleep for
that 20 minute power nap.

01:02:49.138 --> 01:02:50.319
(laughing)

01:02:50.319 --> 01:02:52.127
I don't mean right now, as we speak.

01:02:52.127 --> 01:02:55.498
At about lie 5:30, six o'clock at night,

01:02:55.498 --> 01:02:57.165
generally if I'm flipping around,

01:02:57.165 --> 01:02:58.748
and watching Pardon the Interruption,

01:02:58.748 --> 01:03:01.439
that I notice that I fall asleep a lot.

01:03:01.439 --> 01:03:02.689
Show on ESPN.

01:03:02.689 --> 01:03:03.679
(laughing)

01:03:03.679 --> 01:03:04.911
- Yeah.

01:03:04.911 --> 01:03:05.810
- About 14.

01:03:05.810 --> 01:03:08.060
(laughing)

01:03:10.231 --> 01:03:12.461
Right around 14 yeah.

01:03:12.461 --> 01:03:14.544
- Yeah like six to eight.

01:03:15.398 --> 01:03:16.231
- Yeah okay.

01:03:16.231 --> 01:03:18.319
- Is that weird?

01:03:18.319 --> 01:03:20.450
I always sleep five and
a half hours, I'm normal.

01:03:20.450 --> 01:03:21.283
(laughing)

01:03:21.283 --> 01:03:22.116
6.4 hours.

01:03:23.010 --> 01:03:24.711
(laughing)

01:03:24.711 --> 01:03:27.101
I'd say five to eight with
a lot of afternoon naps.

01:03:27.101 --> 01:03:29.679
After I type out my weird things.

01:03:29.679 --> 01:03:31.421
(laughing)

01:03:31.421 --> 01:03:32.431
- While breastfeeding.

01:03:32.431 --> 01:03:33.319
- While breastfeeding.

01:03:33.319 --> 01:03:35.569
(laughing)

01:03:37.831 --> 01:03:38.998
- Not a human.

01:03:40.009 --> 01:03:40.909
- A dragon.

01:03:40.909 --> 01:03:42.381
(laughing)

01:03:42.381 --> 01:03:44.250
- I breastfeed a really cute dragon.

01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:45.930
(laughing)

01:03:45.930 --> 01:03:46.861
- Okay, oh by the way,

01:03:46.861 --> 01:03:47.694
when all this is over,

01:03:47.694 --> 01:03:49.450
the bar is open,

01:03:49.450 --> 01:03:51.621
and there's a special
drink that we invented,

01:03:51.621 --> 01:03:52.941
just for this program.

01:03:52.941 --> 01:03:54.599
It's called the Brain Freeze.

01:03:54.599 --> 01:03:56.071
(laughing)

01:03:56.071 --> 01:03:57.711
So you just got up there and
ask for the Brain Freeze.

01:03:57.711 --> 01:03:59.111
We invented it.

01:03:59.111 --> 01:04:01.781
The drink did not exist before tonight.

01:04:01.781 --> 01:04:04.130
And it has sort of the
color of your brain,

01:04:04.130 --> 01:04:05.213
brain matter.

01:04:06.648 --> 01:04:07.959
But it's really tasty.

01:04:07.959 --> 01:04:08.879
- That does sound good.

01:04:08.879 --> 01:04:09.890
(laughing)

01:04:09.890 --> 01:04:11.130
- Mm hmm a gray drink.

01:04:11.130 --> 01:04:13.809
- Kahlua, milk, and nails.

01:04:13.809 --> 01:04:16.439
(laughing)

01:04:16.439 --> 01:04:18.090
- So check it out after the Q and A.

01:04:18.090 --> 01:04:20.410
So you ready to go back in.

01:04:20.410 --> 01:04:21.243
Okay.

01:04:21.243 --> 01:04:22.076
(cheering)

01:04:22.076 --> 01:04:23.079
- Let's do this now.

01:04:23.079 --> 01:04:24.479
(clapping)

01:04:24.479 --> 01:04:25.312
- We're back.

01:04:25.312 --> 01:04:27.019
StarTalk Live at Bam!

01:04:27.019 --> 01:04:31.519
(cheering)
(clapping)

01:04:35.791 --> 01:04:38.999
We are talking about the
science of the brain.

01:04:38.999 --> 01:04:41.021
And I want to know,

01:04:41.021 --> 01:04:43.930
what the future holds for us.

01:04:43.930 --> 01:04:45.370
I've got it written here,

01:04:45.370 --> 01:04:48.953
that we have 100,000
miles of nerve fibers,

01:04:50.179 --> 01:04:52.058
in each brain.

01:04:52.058 --> 01:04:53.717
That's extraordinary.

01:04:53.717 --> 01:04:56.379
That's a hell of a computer.

01:04:56.379 --> 01:04:58.307
But it still has issues.

01:04:58.307 --> 01:04:59.698
(chuckling)

01:04:59.698 --> 01:05:00.531
No I'm serious.

01:05:00.531 --> 01:05:04.586
There's brain failure
in some people, right.

01:05:04.586 --> 01:05:06.067
I mean so,

01:05:06.067 --> 01:05:07.277
what is the hope,

01:05:07.277 --> 01:05:09.465
for really disentangling what all this is,

01:05:09.465 --> 01:05:11.787
and perhaps be able to fix people,

01:05:11.787 --> 01:05:12.620
who have problems.

01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:14.979
You just go in and snip a connection or,

01:05:14.979 --> 01:05:16.546
nip and tuck.

01:05:16.546 --> 01:05:18.584
What is the future of this?

01:05:18.584 --> 01:05:20.928
- Well I mean it's a huge
problem actually to solve,

01:05:20.928 --> 01:05:22.827
to understand how the brain works.

01:05:22.827 --> 01:05:25.179
You're talking about 100 billion neurons,

01:05:25.179 --> 01:05:29.226
with a quatrillion connections,
possible connections.

01:05:29.226 --> 01:05:33.018
So to understand the
workings of the human brain,

01:05:33.018 --> 01:05:34.356
is one of the greatest mysteries,

01:05:34.356 --> 01:05:36.178
and we're all working
on that very very hard.

01:05:36.178 --> 01:05:38.247
But once we understand how it works,

01:05:38.247 --> 01:05:39.786
then just like a mechanic has to know,

01:05:39.786 --> 01:05:40.727
how the car works,

01:05:40.727 --> 01:05:42.344
so that when you bring
it in when it's broken,

01:05:42.344 --> 01:05:44.275
they know how to go
about trying to fix it.

01:05:44.275 --> 01:05:47.807
So knowing the underline
structure is the beginning.

01:05:47.807 --> 01:05:49.705
- But is it that reductionist,

01:05:49.705 --> 01:05:51.887
not to get all philosophical
on you because,

01:05:51.887 --> 01:05:52.804
in physics,

01:05:54.756 --> 01:05:57.956
you can describe each molecule of air,

01:05:57.956 --> 01:05:59.967
careening off of another one,

01:05:59.967 --> 01:06:01.546
but that description doesn't give you,

01:06:01.546 --> 01:06:03.476
the bulk properties of it.

01:06:03.476 --> 01:06:05.247
You need sort of to step back and say,

01:06:05.247 --> 01:06:07.927
this air has a temperature.

01:06:07.927 --> 01:06:10.266
The individual particle
doesn't have a temperature.

01:06:10.266 --> 01:06:12.285
We have macroscopic
descriptions of things,

01:06:12.285 --> 01:06:14.615
that enable us to function.

01:06:14.615 --> 01:06:17.055
Because you can't describe
every single little thing.

01:06:17.055 --> 01:06:18.455
Do you think the brain will,

01:06:18.455 --> 01:06:19.914
be intractable in that way?

01:06:19.914 --> 01:06:21.554
- So there's,

01:06:21.554 --> 01:06:23.034
what you're trying to say,

01:06:23.034 --> 01:06:24.335
is that if we understand
everything about the brain,

01:06:24.335 --> 01:06:25.586
but we understand the mind,

01:06:25.586 --> 01:06:27.026
or is that, that's what
I think you're saying.

01:06:27.026 --> 01:06:27.859
- [Neil] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:06:27.859 --> 01:06:29.725
- So that would mean that,

01:06:29.725 --> 01:06:32.255
some people think that
the mind or consciousness,

01:06:32.255 --> 01:06:34.143
is an emergent property of the brain.

01:06:34.143 --> 01:06:35.231
And there's--

01:06:35.231 --> 01:06:37.063
- It just happens, is that what you mean?

01:06:37.063 --> 01:06:38.842
- Well the emergence out
of the workings of it.

01:06:38.842 --> 01:06:39.675
- Yeah you have,

01:06:39.675 --> 01:06:40.572
if you have enough circuits,

01:06:40.572 --> 01:06:41.405
you're gonna get a mind.

01:06:41.405 --> 01:06:43.493
- You're get this thing
called consciousness.

01:06:43.493 --> 01:06:46.773
There's something called the
easy problem of consciousness,

01:06:46.773 --> 01:06:47.606
which isn't that easy.

01:06:47.606 --> 01:06:48.743
But that is to say,

01:06:48.743 --> 01:06:50.830
if we can correlate every single thought,

01:06:50.830 --> 01:06:52.823
with the actual workings
of neurons in the brain,

01:06:52.823 --> 01:06:54.410
and let's say we can map all that out,

01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:55.243
and we can do.

01:06:55.243 --> 01:06:56.173
We solve the easy problem.

01:06:56.173 --> 01:06:57.773
But there's still gonna be a hard problem,

01:06:57.773 --> 01:06:59.943
of why is it that those neurons firing,

01:06:59.943 --> 01:07:01.461
and those neuron chemical slushing around,

01:07:01.461 --> 01:07:04.271
cause us to have these
subjective experiences.

01:07:04.271 --> 01:07:05.863
And we might not be able to,

01:07:05.863 --> 01:07:07.512
they call it the explanatory gap.

01:07:07.512 --> 01:07:09.352
We might not be able
to fully explain that.

01:07:09.352 --> 01:07:11.411
But I think we have to start somewhere.

01:07:11.411 --> 01:07:12.933
And just understanding the workings,

01:07:12.933 --> 01:07:15.151
of the basic system is
a good place to begin.

01:07:15.151 --> 01:07:16.781
- Can I ask a really, maybe dumb question,

01:07:16.781 --> 01:07:17.792
maybe not?

01:07:17.792 --> 01:07:21.921
Do we know that consciousness
exists in the brain?

01:07:21.921 --> 01:07:23.712
- I would venture to say yes.

01:07:23.712 --> 01:07:24.545
Because--

01:07:24.545 --> 01:07:25.581
- Well hold on, let me just follow up.

01:07:25.581 --> 01:07:28.191
'Cause I know that when you
take out like half your brain,

01:07:28.191 --> 01:07:29.642
you can still function right.

01:07:29.642 --> 01:07:31.581
You can take out the left hemisphere,

01:07:31.581 --> 01:07:33.631
and the right hemisphere will rewire.

01:07:33.631 --> 01:07:35.392
But then if you were to
cut that in half again,

01:07:35.392 --> 01:07:36.672
you only get a quarter of your brain.

01:07:36.672 --> 01:07:37.752
(laughing)

01:07:37.752 --> 01:07:38.901
Would you still have consciousness?

01:07:38.901 --> 01:07:41.141
And then at what point does
your consciousness disappear?

01:07:41.141 --> 01:07:42.973
- How many subjects have
you done this experiment on?

01:07:42.973 --> 01:07:43.806
(laughing)

01:07:43.806 --> 01:07:44.752
- So we do it everyday in the lab.

01:07:44.752 --> 01:07:46.659
- But seriously, what is the N on this?

01:07:46.659 --> 01:07:48.909
(laughing)

01:07:56.931 --> 01:07:58.962
- Yes, when does it move to your feet?

01:07:58.962 --> 01:08:00.950
(laughing)

01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:02.104
- I mean it's a philosophical question.

01:08:02.104 --> 01:08:03.941
People say if you take little bits,

01:08:03.941 --> 01:08:05.112
and parts of the brain away,

01:08:05.112 --> 01:08:05.990
how much can you take away,

01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:07.253
how much of the brain
do you actually need,

01:08:07.253 --> 01:08:08.333
for conscious awareness?

01:08:08.333 --> 01:08:12.042
And some people claim that
you only need the brain stem.

01:08:12.042 --> 01:08:13.042
Well we know that that's not true,

01:08:13.042 --> 01:08:14.392
because if you take a full adult,

01:08:14.392 --> 01:08:15.402
and you take away their cortex,

01:08:15.402 --> 01:08:17.013
or they have a damage to the cortex,

01:08:17.013 --> 01:08:18.562
their not gonna be conscious anymore.

01:08:18.562 --> 01:08:19.842
However there are children,

01:08:19.842 --> 01:08:21.912
who are born without a cortex,

01:08:21.912 --> 01:08:23.121
and they just have their brain stem,

01:08:23.121 --> 01:08:25.171
and they have some semblance,

01:08:25.171 --> 01:08:26.522
of what we might call consciousness.

01:08:26.522 --> 01:08:28.613
- Are these what we call
children of the damned?

01:08:28.613 --> 01:08:30.863
(laughing)

01:08:31.699 --> 01:08:33.696
- You can't joke about anencephaly.

01:08:33.696 --> 01:08:35.897
You can't joke about anencephaly.

01:08:35.897 --> 01:08:37.177
- I didn't know there was a name for it.

01:08:37.177 --> 01:08:39.329
(laughing)

01:08:39.329 --> 01:08:40.217
- But seriously,

01:08:40.217 --> 01:08:42.467
(laughing)

01:08:43.457 --> 01:08:45.399
I'll have conversations,

01:08:45.399 --> 01:08:46.297
with dogs.
- Sounded like they were fine.

01:08:46.297 --> 01:08:47.697
- Yeah.

01:08:47.697 --> 01:08:50.137
- I'll have conversations with dogs.

01:08:50.137 --> 01:08:52.239
I can see dogs are dreaming.

01:08:52.239 --> 01:08:55.322
Dogs experience the joy of discovery.

01:08:57.017 --> 01:09:00.751
But is a dog paralyzed by self doubt?

01:09:00.751 --> 01:09:02.180
Actually, I think I've even seen that.

01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:05.220
(laughing)

01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:08.077
No a dog with especially,

01:09:08.077 --> 01:09:10.169
aggressively disciplining owner,

01:09:10.169 --> 01:09:11.369
seem to be paralyzed.

01:09:11.369 --> 01:09:12.751
Like I can't cross this line,

01:09:12.751 --> 01:09:13.878
or the guy's gonna hit me.

01:09:13.878 --> 01:09:14.711
And so,

01:09:16.207 --> 01:09:17.207
do we study,

01:09:18.628 --> 01:09:20.449
how far back do we go,

01:09:20.449 --> 01:09:21.782
from what is it,

01:09:22.738 --> 01:09:23.649
Rhesus, what's the guy's name?

01:09:23.649 --> 01:09:24.557
- Rhesus monkey?

01:09:24.557 --> 01:09:25.390
- But they have,

01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:26.620
it begins with a K?

01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:27.620
The monkeys?

01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:28.453
- More information.

01:09:28.453 --> 01:09:29.779
- In Amy Farrah Fowler's lab.

01:09:29.779 --> 01:09:30.612
- Capuchin.

01:09:30.612 --> 01:09:31.445
- Oh Capuchin?

01:09:31.445 --> 01:09:33.148
It's a C, not a K.

01:09:33.148 --> 01:09:35.260
(laughing)

01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:36.093
- Duh.

01:09:36.959 --> 01:09:38.380
- Historical science is real!

01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:39.860
(laughing)

01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:40.693
- Oh wow.

01:09:41.809 --> 01:09:43.479
Petersburg reference.

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:44.889
So the Commonwealth of Kentucky.

01:09:44.889 --> 01:09:47.391
So, how far down do we go.

01:09:47.391 --> 01:09:48.391
Then there's a cat.

01:09:48.391 --> 01:09:51.728
Then I've spoken, albeit
briefly with birds.

01:09:51.728 --> 01:09:52.660
(laughing)

01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:54.009
And it's a different deal right.

01:09:54.009 --> 01:09:54.842
- So I think,

01:09:54.842 --> 01:09:55.675
once we--

01:09:55.675 --> 01:09:56.959
- Bill, you're Dr. Doolittle,

01:09:56.959 --> 01:09:59.908
as well as the Science Guy, okay, okay.

01:09:59.908 --> 01:10:02.708
- Once we have a measure of consciousness,

01:10:02.708 --> 01:10:03.839
then we will be able to say,

01:10:03.839 --> 01:10:04.672
does this animal have it,

01:10:04.672 --> 01:10:05.780
does a baby have it?

01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:07.020
When is it emergent.

01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:09.076
But until we have an
understanding of what it is.

01:10:09.076 --> 01:10:10.009
So there are certain theories,

01:10:10.009 --> 01:10:11.119
of consciousness.

01:10:11.119 --> 01:10:12.748
One is that it's a certain,

01:10:12.748 --> 01:10:14.639
when you have a system that
has a certain amount of,

01:10:14.639 --> 01:10:16.988
integrated differentiated information,

01:10:16.988 --> 01:10:18.878
that it will fundamentally
have consciousness.

01:10:18.878 --> 01:10:19.759
That could be a computer.

01:10:19.759 --> 01:10:22.868
That could be any kind of
system, a nervous system.

01:10:22.868 --> 01:10:25.660
So once we have an understanding,
a theory of consciousness,

01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:27.666
then we can measure it
and see what has it.

01:10:27.666 --> 01:10:29.378
- Well and I think it's
important to think about,

01:10:29.378 --> 01:10:31.108
if you take out quote half the brain,

01:10:31.108 --> 01:10:32.757
you're essentially dealing with,

01:10:32.757 --> 01:10:35.655
duplicated structures existing correct.

01:10:35.655 --> 01:10:37.188
So there's gonna be some assymetry,

01:10:37.188 --> 01:10:38.096
between left and right.

01:10:38.096 --> 01:10:40.177
But you're dealing with half of a brain,

01:10:40.177 --> 01:10:41.588
that then is pretty much duplicating,

01:10:41.588 --> 01:10:42.708
all the structures you removed.

01:10:42.708 --> 01:10:45.055
Once you start chopping up that half,

01:10:45.055 --> 01:10:46.999
there's really no more
duplicated structures,

01:10:46.999 --> 01:10:47.987
you can start taking.

01:10:47.987 --> 01:10:48.828
So if there's,
- Prove it.

01:10:48.828 --> 01:10:49.844
- Amygdala left.

01:10:49.844 --> 01:10:51.026
(laughing)

01:10:51.026 --> 01:10:52.838
You can't take away that Amygdala.

01:10:52.838 --> 01:10:54.380
There's nothing to take that place.

01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:56.620
So if you want to start
chopping up cortex,

01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:59.388
or if there's an accident that
compromises part of cortex,

01:10:59.388 --> 01:11:01.049
you have other parts of cortex,

01:11:01.049 --> 01:11:02.420
that are similarly structured,

01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:04.158
that can theoretically take over,

01:11:04.158 --> 01:11:05.169
some of that function.

01:11:05.169 --> 01:11:07.098
Once you start getting into
those limbic structures,

01:11:07.098 --> 01:11:08.009
and the sub limbic structures,

01:11:08.009 --> 01:11:08.842
all that stuff,

01:11:08.842 --> 01:11:09.758
there's no more duplication.

01:11:09.758 --> 01:11:11.140
You can't keep like hacking it in half.

01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:13.500
It's not like a calculous limit.

01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:14.748
Like how much can I leave,

01:11:14.748 --> 01:11:17.398
and still have the person be conscious.

01:11:17.398 --> 01:11:19.430
(laughing)

01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:21.149
- Fundamental theory of calculous.

01:11:21.149 --> 01:11:21.982
- You understood what I said.

01:11:21.982 --> 01:11:23.740
- I understood what you said.

01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:26.340
You can't have a person with
a brain the size of a penny.

01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:27.173
It's too little.

01:11:27.173 --> 01:11:28.006
- But you know what's really interesting.

01:11:28.006 --> 01:11:29.460
(laughing)

01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:30.398
- You were saying chopping
up and chopping up,

01:11:30.398 --> 01:11:31.678
and I was sitting here just actually,

01:11:31.678 --> 01:11:33.100
thinking of your vegan cookbook.

01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:35.350
(laughing)

01:11:38.569 --> 01:11:40.069
- Broccoli rabe with brain is not bad.

01:11:40.069 --> 01:11:40.950
(laughing)

01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:42.237
- The really interesting thing here,

01:11:42.237 --> 01:11:43.118
is that you can actually,

01:11:43.118 --> 01:11:44.787
you can take away the Amygdala,

01:11:44.787 --> 01:11:45.787
which you can take--

01:11:45.787 --> 01:11:47.267
- But what about the hypothalamus?

01:11:47.267 --> 01:11:49.147
- You can even take away the hypothalamus.

01:11:49.147 --> 01:11:50.956
- What, how will I even hear?

01:11:50.956 --> 01:11:53.916
- Heather you said that way too glibly.

01:11:53.916 --> 01:11:55.038
- Well I mean if there's certain people,

01:11:55.038 --> 01:11:56.699
who are born with calcified Amygdali,

01:11:56.699 --> 01:11:59.649
so they actually, they
have a disease actually,

01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:00.588
that calcifies their Amygdali.

01:12:00.588 --> 01:12:02.908
So they become damaged
and they no longer work.

01:12:02.908 --> 01:12:04.097
So you can be, let's say you can be,

01:12:04.097 --> 01:12:05.089
you can not have emotion,

01:12:05.089 --> 01:12:05.967
you can still be conscious.

01:12:05.967 --> 01:12:07.129
You can not have memory,

01:12:07.129 --> 01:12:08.468
and you can still be conscious.

01:12:08.468 --> 01:12:09.947
There's a case in England where,

01:12:09.947 --> 01:12:12.599
he only remembers things for 30 seconds.

01:12:12.599 --> 01:12:13.432
So each 30 seconds,

01:12:13.432 --> 01:12:14.265
he writes down.

01:12:14.265 --> 01:12:16.319
I'm just now conscious
for the very first time.

01:12:16.319 --> 01:12:17.967
And then I'm just now conscious
for the very first time.

01:12:17.967 --> 01:12:19.649
But he still having awareness.

01:12:19.649 --> 01:12:20.599
So the question is,

01:12:20.599 --> 01:12:22.409
how much, yeah you can
take away all these things,

01:12:22.409 --> 01:12:23.242
- How does he remember how to write?

01:12:23.242 --> 01:12:24.075
- How much of the brain is necessary,

01:12:24.075 --> 01:12:25.159
to have subjective experience?

01:12:25.159 --> 01:12:26.449
- Yeah actually that is a great question.

01:12:26.449 --> 01:12:28.497
How does he remember how to write?

01:12:28.497 --> 01:12:29.479
- Has he seen Memento?

01:12:29.479 --> 01:12:30.468
- This is very interesting.

01:12:30.468 --> 01:12:32.119
This is the same question.

01:12:32.119 --> 01:12:33.748
- Is a very good question.

01:12:33.748 --> 01:12:34.581
- It's Michael's question.

01:12:34.581 --> 01:12:35.414
I don't want it.

01:12:35.414 --> 01:12:36.385
- He's seen it 3000 times.

01:12:36.385 --> 01:12:37.938
- But every single time,

01:12:37.938 --> 01:12:39.477
it's like the first time.

01:12:39.477 --> 01:12:40.578
(laughing)

01:12:40.578 --> 01:12:41.915
- I love it every time.

01:12:41.915 --> 01:12:43.937
- So there's something
called procedural memory,

01:12:43.937 --> 01:12:45.828
which is different than
declarative memory.

01:12:45.828 --> 01:12:47.286
- It's like riding a bicycle.

01:12:47.286 --> 01:12:48.119
- Exactly.

01:12:48.119 --> 01:12:49.414
So when you learn something like motoric,

01:12:49.414 --> 01:12:50.754
like riding a bike or tying a shoe.

01:12:50.754 --> 01:12:52.185
So what's interesting
about this case in England,

01:12:52.185 --> 01:12:54.195
is that he was a pianist,

01:12:54.195 --> 01:12:55.474
and he could,

01:12:55.474 --> 01:12:56.974
once he got started playing,

01:12:56.974 --> 01:12:59.484
he could play the entire piece of music,

01:12:59.484 --> 01:13:00.414
all the way through.

01:13:00.414 --> 01:13:01.305
As soon as he came out of it,

01:13:01.305 --> 01:13:02.174
he didn't know where he was,

01:13:02.174 --> 01:13:03.007
what he was doing, whatever.

01:13:03.007 --> 01:13:04.385
But it's a procedural memories,

01:13:04.385 --> 01:13:05.683
with a different part of the brain,

01:13:05.683 --> 01:13:06.756
called the basal ganglia,

01:13:06.756 --> 01:13:08.076
which you can engage in,

01:13:08.076 --> 01:13:10.054
even if you don't have
declarative memories,

01:13:10.054 --> 01:13:11.614
or like memories, semantic memories.

01:13:11.614 --> 01:13:13.756
Memories about things or facts.

01:13:13.756 --> 01:13:15.543
- So it looks like all of
your research is happening,

01:13:15.543 --> 01:13:18.774
on people who have brain disorders.

01:13:18.774 --> 01:13:20.554
- It's some of the best ways
to learn about the brain,

01:13:20.554 --> 01:13:21.804
is by seeing what happens,

01:13:21.804 --> 01:13:23.276
in the natural world,

01:13:23.276 --> 01:13:24.596
when it doesn't work.

01:13:24.596 --> 01:13:26.814
Because of all sorts of
legal and ethical issues,

01:13:26.814 --> 01:13:28.945
we can't do that.

01:13:28.945 --> 01:13:29.996
- On a living person.

01:13:29.996 --> 01:13:30.956
- So we take what nature gives us,

01:13:30.956 --> 01:13:33.414
but that's one of the things that,

01:13:33.414 --> 01:13:35.025
every brain lesion is different.

01:13:35.025 --> 01:13:36.145
Every accident is different.

01:13:36.145 --> 01:13:37.745
There's a tremendous
amount of unpredictability,

01:13:37.745 --> 01:13:40.996
when you're dealing with any
of these sorts of syndromes.

01:13:40.996 --> 01:13:43.579
- So you used brain mapping to,

01:13:45.297 --> 01:13:48.326
is that the way to go to cure these,

01:13:48.326 --> 01:13:51.148
horrific brain diseases like
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

01:13:51.148 --> 01:13:51.981
- Just sleep more.

01:13:51.981 --> 01:13:52.814
I can cure that.

01:13:52.814 --> 01:13:53.647
(laughing)

01:13:53.647 --> 01:13:55.337
- Well I've got a question,
I have a question.

01:13:55.337 --> 01:13:57.897
I had my brain scanned a
couple times on camera,

01:13:57.897 --> 01:13:59.516
for hilarious science comedy.

01:13:59.516 --> 01:14:01.766
(laughing)

01:14:03.245 --> 01:14:05.485
It seemed to me--

01:14:05.485 --> 01:14:06.476
- Bill you got your brain,

01:14:06.476 --> 01:14:08.966
'cause I said Bill you
need your brain examined.

01:14:08.966 --> 01:14:10.017
(laughing)

01:14:10.017 --> 01:14:11.154
- Yeah and it was empty.

01:14:11.154 --> 01:14:11.987
(laughing)

01:14:11.987 --> 01:14:12.916
Amazing.

01:14:12.916 --> 01:14:13.749
I just said it's not empty,

01:14:13.749 --> 01:14:15.542
I just done use it, that's all.

01:14:15.542 --> 01:14:17.396
So it looked to me,

01:14:17.396 --> 01:14:19.646
like if you could get,

01:14:19.646 --> 01:14:21.257
another order of magnitude,

01:14:21.257 --> 01:14:22.090
that is to say,

01:14:22.090 --> 01:14:23.372
what is the current resolution,

01:14:23.372 --> 01:14:25.164
of a magnetic resonance image?

01:14:25.164 --> 01:14:27.311
It looks like it's half a milometer.

01:14:27.311 --> 01:14:28.144
- Yep.

01:14:28.144 --> 01:14:28.977
- Something like that.

01:14:28.977 --> 01:14:29.892
- Yep, yep.

01:14:29.892 --> 01:14:31.182
- It looked to me like if you had another,

01:14:31.182 --> 01:14:33.982
instead of half a milometer,

01:14:33.982 --> 01:14:35.065
a 50 microns,

01:14:37.252 --> 01:14:39.862
then you'd really be able to
figure out what was going on.

01:14:39.862 --> 01:14:40.695
- Well this is where we're at.

01:14:40.695 --> 01:14:42.364
- Is that too reductionist to your point?

01:14:42.364 --> 01:14:43.363
- No I like reductionism.

01:14:43.363 --> 01:14:46.561
I just was wondering if
that was the pathway to--

01:14:46.561 --> 01:14:47.791
- This is, so where we're at is that--

01:14:47.791 --> 01:14:49.353
- I converted to reductionism
when I got married.

01:14:49.353 --> 01:14:51.603
(laughing)

01:14:52.553 --> 01:14:53.742
Happy wife, happy life.

01:14:53.742 --> 01:14:54.961
(laughing)

01:14:54.961 --> 01:14:56.513
- Reductionism.

01:14:56.513 --> 01:14:57.346
- So,

01:14:57.346 --> 01:14:59.596
(laughing)

01:15:04.792 --> 01:15:05.771
the state of affairs now,

01:15:05.771 --> 01:15:08.131
is that we have this technology,

01:15:08.131 --> 01:15:10.280
to be able to look at the
microstructure of the brain.

01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:13.187
So we can go in and measure
the activation of one or two,

01:15:13.187 --> 01:15:14.651
individual neurons in a monkey,

01:15:14.651 --> 01:15:17.419
or even in a human when
they're during surgery.

01:15:17.419 --> 01:15:19.320
And we can look at this
very microstructure,

01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:20.819
and then we look at the macro structure,

01:15:20.819 --> 01:15:23.110
or the activation in things, like FMRI,

01:15:23.110 --> 01:15:23.943
which is like a--

01:15:23.943 --> 01:15:25.000
- Functional magnetic resonance.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.080
- Functional magnetic resonance imaging.

01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:29.251
Which is sort of looking
from very far away.

01:15:29.251 --> 01:15:31.131
But we need something in between,

01:15:31.131 --> 01:15:32.979
like a meso level to understand how,

01:15:32.979 --> 01:15:34.200
all these circuits are wired up.

01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:36.560
'Cause just looking at
where the blood flows,

01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:38.342
to a certain area, that's
what FMRI is looking at,

01:15:38.342 --> 01:15:39.870
is too--

01:15:39.870 --> 01:15:40.703
- [Bill] Course.

01:15:40.703 --> 01:15:41.536
- Exactly.

01:15:41.536 --> 01:15:42.959
And the other way is too fine.

01:15:42.959 --> 01:15:43.830
So we need something in between.

01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:45.400
And there are certain
technologies that are,

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:46.350
being developed now.

01:15:46.350 --> 01:15:47.904
Things like optogenetics,

01:15:47.904 --> 01:15:49.685
where you can actually look
at the neuro circuitry,

01:15:49.685 --> 01:15:50.864
and control.

01:15:50.864 --> 01:15:52.554
- So optogenetics, I did
a little reading on that.

01:15:52.554 --> 01:15:54.103
And so, you've got,

01:15:54.103 --> 01:15:56.544
photoreceptive organisms,

01:15:56.544 --> 01:15:57.473
you put in the brain,

01:15:57.473 --> 01:15:58.613
or proteins.

01:15:58.613 --> 01:16:00.565
And then you follow the
light that they emit.

01:16:00.565 --> 01:16:01.398
Is that how that works?

01:16:01.398 --> 01:16:02.231
- It's sort of like that.

01:16:02.231 --> 01:16:03.064
- Is this from Wrath of Kahn?

01:16:03.064 --> 01:16:05.314
(laughing)

01:16:06.714 --> 01:16:08.233
- Oh God.

01:16:08.233 --> 01:16:09.536
God!

01:16:09.536 --> 01:16:11.786
(laughing)

01:16:14.624 --> 01:16:15.805
- That was really worth it.

01:16:15.805 --> 01:16:16.638
- That was deep.

01:16:16.638 --> 01:16:17.471
That was very--

01:16:17.471 --> 01:16:21.016
- Pairing geeks up here on the stage.

01:16:21.016 --> 01:16:22.746
So these are ways.
- Cerebellum there.

01:16:22.746 --> 01:16:25.496
- These are ways to poke and
prod a living person's brain,

01:16:25.496 --> 01:16:26.365
without doing damage.

01:16:26.365 --> 01:16:28.056
- Yeah basically you can insert,

01:16:28.056 --> 01:16:29.976
you take these from photosensitive algae.

01:16:29.976 --> 01:16:31.466
You take the gene that coats for that.

01:16:31.466 --> 01:16:32.435
You insert it in a virus,

01:16:32.435 --> 01:16:34.373
which then inserts that into the,

01:16:34.373 --> 01:16:35.586
animal so far.

01:16:35.586 --> 01:16:36.797
- Talk faster Heather, faster, faster.

01:16:36.797 --> 01:16:37.946
(laughing)

01:16:37.946 --> 01:16:38.845
- Right right,

01:16:38.845 --> 01:16:39.976
you just said,

01:16:39.976 --> 01:16:41.536
you get a photoreceptive virus,

01:16:41.536 --> 01:16:42.774
that you stick in someone's brain.

01:16:42.774 --> 01:16:43.837
Did I just hear that?

01:16:43.837 --> 01:16:46.026
- You take the gene of
the photoreceptive algae,

01:16:46.026 --> 01:16:48.125
and then you want to
transport it into the brain,

01:16:48.125 --> 01:16:49.624
so you do it via a virus.

01:16:49.624 --> 01:16:50.866
That's not dangerous.

01:16:50.866 --> 01:16:52.336
- So you're letting your
virus do your bidding,

01:16:52.336 --> 01:16:53.205
in someone's brain.

01:16:53.205 --> 01:16:54.205
- Yeah and so then what happens.

01:16:54.205 --> 01:16:55.704
- With their permission.

01:16:55.704 --> 01:16:57.186
- It's a friendly virus.
- You put the thing in is ear,

01:16:57.186 --> 01:16:59.216
and goes into the.

01:16:59.216 --> 01:17:00.049
I remember.

01:17:00.049 --> 01:17:01.114
We saw it.

01:17:01.114 --> 01:17:01.947
- That was creepy.

01:17:01.947 --> 01:17:02.780
- It's a virus,

01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:04.845
it's algae that you attach to a virus.

01:17:04.845 --> 01:17:06.364
- Yes, Eugene yes.

01:17:06.364 --> 01:17:08.614
(laughing)

01:17:10.624 --> 01:17:13.457
(talking at once)

01:17:14.303 --> 01:17:15.136
- I got this now.

01:17:15.136 --> 01:17:17.085
- Viral algae Eugene.

01:17:17.085 --> 01:17:19.024
Everybody knows this.

01:17:19.024 --> 01:17:21.353
- Let me see if I got this right.

01:17:21.353 --> 01:17:23.976
The algae has photoreceptive proteins.

01:17:23.976 --> 01:17:24.809
- Yes.

01:17:24.809 --> 01:17:28.045
- There's no good way to get
that protein into another,

01:17:28.045 --> 01:17:31.725
living body unless you
attach it to a virus,

01:17:31.725 --> 01:17:33.477
where that's what they do.

01:17:33.477 --> 01:17:35.146
- Well they're gonna start replicating,

01:17:35.146 --> 01:17:36.605
they're gonna start transcribing correct.

01:17:36.605 --> 01:17:38.963
- Yeah and then what happens is that now,

01:17:38.963 --> 01:17:40.357
wherever you insert this gene,

01:17:40.357 --> 01:17:42.444
now you've inserted a receptor,

01:17:42.444 --> 01:17:44.277
that's gonna be sensitive to light.

01:17:44.277 --> 01:17:45.604
So now when you shine light on it,

01:17:45.604 --> 01:17:47.043
the neuron will fire.

01:17:47.043 --> 01:17:49.416
And so what they've
shown, let's say in mice,

01:17:49.416 --> 01:17:50.443
for example,

01:17:50.443 --> 01:17:51.906
is that you can shine a certain,

01:17:51.906 --> 01:17:52.754
like a blue light,

01:17:52.754 --> 01:17:53.624
and cause a whole circuit,

01:17:53.624 --> 01:17:55.215
because it's being activated.

01:17:55.215 --> 01:17:56.048
- Dr. Roland.

01:17:56.048 --> 01:17:57.095
- Yes.

01:17:57.095 --> 01:17:57.928
Yeah.
- Is it,

01:17:57.928 --> 01:17:58.761
that you shine a light,

01:17:58.761 --> 01:18:00.724
and it causes the neuron to fire,

01:18:00.724 --> 01:18:02.495
or when the neuron fires,

01:18:02.495 --> 01:18:03.725
it lights up?

01:18:03.725 --> 01:18:04.957
- No, okay.

01:18:04.957 --> 01:18:07.245
You're shining.
- Bill.

01:18:07.245 --> 01:18:09.536
- I see where you're going.

01:18:09.536 --> 01:18:11.483
Well you know, when you shine the light,

01:18:11.483 --> 01:18:13.344
the receptors that are sensitive to light,

01:18:13.344 --> 01:18:16.133
open, which then cause
the neurons to fire.

01:18:16.133 --> 01:18:18.133
Because then there's a whole rush of,

01:18:18.133 --> 01:18:19.323
a whole chemical activated.
- So both.

01:18:19.323 --> 01:18:21.784
- So the virus is
introducing a sensitivity.

01:18:21.784 --> 01:18:23.632
- Which is detectable.

01:18:23.632 --> 01:18:25.613
The purpose of that is
to make it detectable.

01:18:25.613 --> 01:18:26.544
- That's the whole point.

01:18:26.544 --> 01:18:29.182
- This is Schrodinger's viral algae right.

01:18:29.182 --> 01:18:30.853
(laughing)

01:18:30.853 --> 01:18:31.950
Physics joke Paul.

01:18:31.950 --> 01:18:32.783
- Yeah classic.

01:18:32.783 --> 01:18:33.616
It's a great.

01:18:33.616 --> 01:18:35.493
- So Heather.

01:18:35.493 --> 01:18:37.363
- That's no ordinary water bottle.

01:18:37.363 --> 01:18:38.196
- There's two sides to this.

01:18:38.196 --> 01:18:39.424
There's, you want to repair people,

01:18:39.424 --> 01:18:41.747
who have real neurological disorders,

01:18:41.747 --> 01:18:42.904
Parkinson's,

01:18:42.904 --> 01:18:46.710
but maybe you want to make people smarter,

01:18:46.710 --> 01:18:49.231
or more, like you said, superhuman.

01:18:49.231 --> 01:18:50.361
- I'd love to throw a car.

01:18:50.361 --> 01:18:51.194
What do I need to do?

01:18:51.194 --> 01:18:53.413
(laughing)

01:18:53.413 --> 01:18:55.680
- So is any, are you--

01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:57.091
- How much algae do I eat?

01:18:57.091 --> 01:18:59.024
(laughing)

01:18:59.024 --> 01:19:01.179
- Are you or your people,

01:19:01.179 --> 01:19:02.293
- It's in her book.

01:19:02.293 --> 01:19:03.126
It's in the book.

01:19:03.126 --> 01:19:04.623
- Are they involved in this work,

01:19:04.623 --> 01:19:07.912
trying to enhance human
intellectual performance?

01:19:07.912 --> 01:19:10.653
- There's something
called neuro prosthetics.

01:19:10.653 --> 01:19:11.486
And this is where,

01:19:11.486 --> 01:19:12.319
we're using some of it right now,

01:19:12.319 --> 01:19:13.395
to treat psychiatric illness,

01:19:13.395 --> 01:19:14.714
where we implant electrodes,

01:19:14.714 --> 01:19:16.085
it's called deep brain stimulation,

01:19:16.085 --> 01:19:17.981
to help treat psychiatric patients.

01:19:17.981 --> 01:19:19.591
But there are things
called neuro prosthetics,

01:19:19.591 --> 01:19:20.933
where you can implant electrodes,

01:19:20.933 --> 01:19:21.989
that help people for example,

01:19:21.989 --> 01:19:24.041
who are deaf to hear,

01:19:24.041 --> 01:19:25.731
or to help blind people see.

01:19:25.731 --> 01:19:27.682
And that technology is already being,

01:19:27.682 --> 01:19:29.589
it's in pilot studies now.

01:19:29.589 --> 01:19:31.419
- There's a whole field
of neuro engineering,

01:19:31.419 --> 01:19:32.431
that is combining.

01:19:32.431 --> 01:19:33.891
- And eventually yes,

01:19:33.891 --> 01:19:37.093
we can do things like enhance
memory and enhance attention,

01:19:37.093 --> 01:19:38.391
by using these neuron prosthetics.

01:19:38.391 --> 01:19:39.421
- Is this like drinking Red Bull?

01:19:39.421 --> 01:19:41.671
(laughing)

01:19:43.053 --> 01:19:43.886
- Similar.

01:19:43.886 --> 01:19:46.136
(laughing)

01:19:47.682 --> 01:19:49.849
- Okay you're stimulating,

01:19:50.853 --> 01:19:52.341
our brain, as far as I can tell,

01:19:52.341 --> 01:19:55.041
is chemistry and electricity.

01:19:55.041 --> 01:19:57.466
I mean is it something beyond that?

01:19:57.466 --> 01:19:59.082
You're manipulating,

01:19:59.082 --> 01:20:00.293
either the chemistry of the brain,

01:20:00.293 --> 01:20:03.110
or the electrical circuitry of the brain,

01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:04.901
with magnetic fields or whatever else.

01:20:04.901 --> 01:20:05.773
Alright so,

01:20:05.773 --> 01:20:07.341
if that's the case,

01:20:07.341 --> 01:20:09.951
I know my computer uses
electrical circuits.

01:20:09.951 --> 01:20:12.253
So is there a future
where we're gonna attach,

01:20:12.253 --> 01:20:14.336
your brain to a computer?

01:20:15.362 --> 01:20:16.671
- Yeah I don't see why not.

01:20:16.671 --> 01:20:17.821
I mean we already in a sense--

01:20:17.821 --> 01:20:18.654
- We already do.

01:20:18.654 --> 01:20:20.671
- We already in a sense are.

01:20:20.671 --> 01:20:22.070
- We're doing that after the show.

01:20:22.070 --> 01:20:24.320
(laughing)

01:20:25.170 --> 01:20:26.250
- It's awesome.

01:20:26.250 --> 01:20:29.109
(laughing)

01:20:29.109 --> 01:20:29.948
- But there is a,

01:20:29.948 --> 01:20:31.031
I have an old question about,

01:20:31.031 --> 01:20:32.781
magnetism and brains.

01:20:33.719 --> 01:20:35.747
There are animals, apparently,

01:20:35.747 --> 01:20:37.989
that find direction on their own,

01:20:37.989 --> 01:20:39.439
using some sort of feral,

01:20:39.439 --> 01:20:42.301
some sort of feras, iron bearing thing,

01:20:42.301 --> 01:20:45.061
in their cells, in their brains.

01:20:45.061 --> 01:20:47.039
But we never got that.

01:20:47.039 --> 01:20:48.261
How did they get sorted out?

01:20:48.261 --> 01:20:49.130
(laughing)

01:20:49.130 --> 01:20:50.638
- Bill you're trying to find true north.

01:20:50.638 --> 01:20:52.239
You want to go north.

01:20:52.239 --> 01:20:53.519
- [Bill] All I want is magnetic north.

01:20:53.519 --> 01:20:54.352
I'm good with that.

01:20:54.352 --> 01:20:56.119
- Well the fact that MRI machines work,

01:20:56.119 --> 01:20:57.919
indicates that there
are magnetic properties,

01:20:57.919 --> 01:21:00.210
I mean there's all sorts of
properties to all of our bodies.

01:21:00.210 --> 01:21:04.210
So there's smaller, lesser
magnetic qualities to our body,

01:21:04.210 --> 01:21:05.941
but no we cannot navigate by them.

01:21:05.941 --> 01:21:06.918
(laughing)

01:21:06.918 --> 01:21:08.461
- Maybe you can't.

01:21:08.461 --> 01:21:11.389
(laughing)

01:21:11.389 --> 01:21:13.410
- He doesn't ask directions.

01:21:13.410 --> 01:21:15.249
- But Bill, other animals
got all kinds of stuff,

01:21:15.249 --> 01:21:16.082
we don't have.

01:21:16.082 --> 01:21:16.915
- Alright.

01:21:16.915 --> 01:21:17.748
- I have wings.

01:21:17.748 --> 01:21:18.798
(laughing)

01:21:18.798 --> 01:21:22.319
- You know newts can
regenerate limbs we can't.

01:21:22.319 --> 01:21:24.267
Eagles can fly, we can't.

01:21:24.267 --> 01:21:26.170
I mean you just go on down the list.

01:21:26.170 --> 01:21:27.261
- Alright we were talking about brains.

01:21:27.261 --> 01:21:28.682
(laughing)

01:21:28.682 --> 01:21:30.451
- Will it get to that thing where,

01:21:30.451 --> 01:21:32.911
our brains really will be like a computer?

01:21:32.911 --> 01:21:34.151
We can hook it up to a computer,

01:21:34.151 --> 01:21:35.139
and be able to speak languages,

01:21:35.139 --> 01:21:36.762
without actually learning them?

01:21:36.762 --> 01:21:39.242
We will be able to download information.

01:21:39.242 --> 01:21:41.192
- Ask Mayim, apparently she can.

01:21:41.192 --> 01:21:44.183
(laughing)

01:21:44.183 --> 01:21:45.524
- No, the answer is no.

01:21:45.524 --> 01:21:46.935
(laughing)

01:21:46.935 --> 01:21:49.453
- Wait I think the answer is
probably yes, though right.

01:21:49.453 --> 01:21:50.383
Eventually.

01:21:50.383 --> 01:21:52.952
(laughing)

01:21:52.952 --> 01:21:54.405
No we can.

01:21:54.405 --> 01:21:55.463
- I'm with you Gene.

01:21:55.463 --> 01:21:58.143
- I mean there's computers
that can translate pretty,

01:21:58.143 --> 01:21:59.124
like Google translate.

01:21:59.124 --> 01:21:59.957
- But we don't need.

01:21:59.957 --> 01:22:00.790
- We'll be able,

01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:01.623
we'll have--

01:22:01.623 --> 01:22:03.245
(talking at once)

01:22:03.245 --> 01:22:04.103
- I'm so excited right now.

01:22:04.103 --> 01:22:05.415
(laughing)

01:22:05.415 --> 01:22:07.394
- Mayim, Mayim.

01:22:07.394 --> 01:22:08.227
What, what yeah?

01:22:08.227 --> 01:22:10.685
Mayim, you ready to bust
the gasket here, go.

01:22:10.685 --> 01:22:11.775
What?
- No,

01:22:11.775 --> 01:22:14.455
learning a language is
a very very complicated,

01:22:14.455 --> 01:22:15.735
just to use that as an example,

01:22:15.735 --> 01:22:17.885
we're not translation machines.

01:22:17.885 --> 01:22:19.085
So in theory,

01:22:19.085 --> 01:22:21.514
I could picture a world where,

01:22:21.514 --> 01:22:24.000
if I had a catalog dictionary,

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.653
I could be hooked up to something,

01:22:25.653 --> 01:22:27.882
that would allow me to
be a translation machine.

01:22:27.882 --> 01:22:30.863
But the subtleties of
language and interaction,

01:22:30.863 --> 01:22:32.471
and the way we communicate
and answer questions,

01:22:32.471 --> 01:22:35.002
and have experiences through language,

01:22:35.002 --> 01:22:36.372
is extremely,

01:22:36.372 --> 01:22:38.823
it's beyond complicated that
you could plug into a computer.

01:22:38.823 --> 01:22:41.903
- But, maybe not having
me speak the language,

01:22:41.903 --> 01:22:44.453
but you could at least maybe read a menu,

01:22:44.453 --> 01:22:45.653
in another country.

01:22:45.653 --> 01:22:47.063
- Sure, I will grant you that, yes.

01:22:47.063 --> 01:22:49.653
- So I know what the hell
I'm getting when I'm Paris.

01:22:49.653 --> 01:22:50.622
- I will grant you that.

01:22:50.622 --> 01:22:51.573
That's possible.

01:22:51.573 --> 01:22:52.669
- Besides eggs.

01:22:52.669 --> 01:22:54.111
(laughing)

01:22:54.111 --> 01:22:55.511
(speaking foreign language)

01:22:55.511 --> 01:22:57.346
- [Eugene] But meaning--

01:22:57.346 --> 01:22:58.533
- Which everyone is a mushroom.

01:22:58.533 --> 01:23:00.191
(laughing)

01:23:00.191 --> 01:23:01.601
- So you wouldn't
understand another language,

01:23:01.601 --> 01:23:03.743
but you could technically translate it,

01:23:03.743 --> 01:23:04.576
hooked up to a computer.

01:23:04.576 --> 01:23:06.722
- I'm guessing about the future,

01:23:06.722 --> 01:23:08.213
so I--

01:23:08.213 --> 01:23:10.173
- No but I kind of
believe anything you say.

01:23:10.173 --> 01:23:12.413
(laughing)

01:23:12.413 --> 01:23:15.022
- When you chew on those pink pills,

01:23:15.022 --> 01:23:16.493
and it shows you where
you haven't brushed,

01:23:16.493 --> 01:23:17.442
how does that work?

01:23:17.442 --> 01:23:19.692
(laughing)

01:23:29.383 --> 01:23:30.383
- Brilliant.

01:23:32.251 --> 01:23:33.733
- Wait, so Heather,

01:23:33.733 --> 01:23:34.566
do you think,

01:23:34.566 --> 01:23:36.863
I'm gonna actually rebute Mayim here,

01:23:36.863 --> 01:23:37.696
do you--

01:23:37.696 --> 01:23:38.529
- You said rebutt.

01:23:38.529 --> 01:23:39.383
- Who would have thought--

01:23:39.383 --> 01:23:40.663
(laughing)

01:23:40.663 --> 01:23:42.431
Who would have thought some years ago,

01:23:42.431 --> 01:23:44.823
that a computer would ever
beat a human in chess?

01:23:44.823 --> 01:23:45.762
Who would have thought that a computer,

01:23:45.762 --> 01:23:48.242
would ever beat a human in jeopardy?

01:23:48.242 --> 01:23:51.480
So, computers are moving pretty fast here.

01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:54.663
So, why wouldn't the context of language,

01:23:54.663 --> 01:23:56.191
be just another thing it learns,

01:23:56.191 --> 01:23:58.591
rather than just a translated dictionary.

01:23:58.591 --> 01:24:02.623
Why should we put limits on the computers,

01:24:02.623 --> 01:24:03.791
that have transcended limits,

01:24:03.791 --> 01:24:05.762
we've ever given for them in the past?

01:24:05.762 --> 01:24:06.911
- They'll eat us as babies.

01:24:06.911 --> 01:24:09.200
(laughing)

01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:10.223
One reason.

01:24:10.223 --> 01:24:11.922
- Those are not equivalent
comparisons though.

01:24:11.922 --> 01:24:14.591
- So intelligence is different.

01:24:14.591 --> 01:24:15.613
So knowledge you'll see,

01:24:15.613 --> 01:24:17.133
computers, if you want
to look at it that way,

01:24:17.133 --> 01:24:17.991
they're already smarter than us.

01:24:17.991 --> 01:24:19.282
They can do math quicker than us.

01:24:19.282 --> 01:24:20.212
They can do calculations.

01:24:20.212 --> 01:24:21.541
They can translate into languages.

01:24:21.541 --> 01:24:23.223
They're much better in terms of,

01:24:23.223 --> 01:24:24.902
holding a lot of information.

01:24:24.902 --> 01:24:26.663
And then why would we even want to,

01:24:26.663 --> 01:24:28.063
sort of incorporate that into our brain.

01:24:28.063 --> 01:24:29.351
Right now we have our iPhones.

01:24:29.351 --> 01:24:30.551
We don't have to remember numbers anymore.

01:24:30.551 --> 01:24:32.373
Our computers do that for us.

01:24:32.373 --> 01:24:33.511
So then one of the questions is,

01:24:33.511 --> 01:24:36.183
what are humans still good for.

01:24:36.183 --> 01:24:38.093
- In fact, the idea that
you'd plug chips in your head,

01:24:38.093 --> 01:24:38.943
to know things,

01:24:38.943 --> 01:24:41.271
it's, this is not a chip in my head,

01:24:41.271 --> 01:24:42.242
but it's in arms reach.

01:24:42.242 --> 01:24:43.343
- And it eventually it will be.

01:24:43.343 --> 01:24:44.210
And eventually,
- It just takes,

01:24:44.210 --> 01:24:45.043
a few extra seconds.

01:24:45.043 --> 01:24:46.241
- Yeah eventually, it'll get smaller,

01:24:46.241 --> 01:24:47.103
and smaller and smaller.

01:24:47.103 --> 01:24:47.936
You can implant the iPhone,

01:24:47.936 --> 01:24:49.551
into your brain and you can talk to it,

01:24:49.551 --> 01:24:50.893
and it'll give you information.

01:24:50.893 --> 01:24:54.143
So, the question is where
does humans come in,

01:24:54.143 --> 01:24:54.976
at some point.
- People already,

01:24:54.976 --> 01:24:55.809
talk to their iPhones.

01:24:55.809 --> 01:24:56.642
- Right they do.

01:24:56.642 --> 01:24:57.475
(laughing)

01:24:57.475 --> 01:24:59.711
- I gotta step in as an engineer here.

01:24:59.711 --> 01:25:00.893
I want to remind you that,

01:25:00.893 --> 01:25:03.271
computers don't just come out of the sky.

01:25:03.271 --> 01:25:04.562
Somebody designs these things.

01:25:04.562 --> 01:25:05.941
(laughing)

01:25:05.941 --> 01:25:07.402
I don't want to shock the guys over here.

01:25:07.402 --> 01:25:10.022
(laughing)

01:25:10.022 --> 01:25:11.623
- I'll believe it when I see it.

01:25:11.623 --> 01:25:12.456
- But then as far as,

01:25:12.456 --> 01:25:14.322
(laughing)

01:25:14.322 --> 01:25:17.081
but then as far as communication
in another language,

01:25:17.081 --> 01:25:19.711
I can easily envision,

01:25:19.711 --> 01:25:21.110
I guess a pun intended,

01:25:21.110 --> 01:25:23.023
a computer that can recognize faces,

01:25:23.023 --> 01:25:24.840
and emotions on faces,

01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:25.830
and then that would enhance,

01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:27.983
the translation of a language.

01:25:27.983 --> 01:25:30.332
Seriously, I don't think
that's an extraordinary step.

01:25:30.332 --> 01:25:31.733
But it's complicated.

01:25:31.733 --> 01:25:35.361
- There's a famous impossible
sentence for computers,

01:25:35.361 --> 01:25:39.342
where you say time flies like an arrow.

01:25:39.342 --> 01:25:41.743
Fruit flies like a banana.

01:25:41.743 --> 01:25:43.623
(laughing)

01:25:43.623 --> 01:25:45.261
- Why is that impossible for a computer?

01:25:45.261 --> 01:25:48.132
- Because the two sentences
are grammatically identical.

01:25:48.132 --> 01:25:50.280
They're grammatically identical,

01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:53.441
yet they have completely
different meanings.

01:25:53.441 --> 01:25:54.922
- Why couldn't a computer learn it,

01:25:54.922 --> 01:25:56.802
the way you did.

01:25:56.802 --> 01:25:59.052
(laughing)

01:26:00.823 --> 01:26:02.823
- [Eugene] Yeah Chomsky.

01:26:04.354 --> 01:26:07.682
- You are tim-ing of the words,

01:26:07.682 --> 01:26:09.742
changed how they were perceived?

01:26:09.742 --> 01:26:11.034
- Yeah, yeah.

01:26:11.034 --> 01:26:13.714
(laughing)

01:26:13.714 --> 01:26:15.794
So what we don't know is
whether the computer then,

01:26:15.794 --> 01:26:17.682
has to have your life experience,

01:26:17.682 --> 01:26:19.943
a human life experience.

01:26:19.943 --> 01:26:21.274
- Consciousness some might say.

01:26:21.274 --> 01:26:23.042
- The real thing is,

01:26:23.042 --> 01:26:24.722
will it eventually have consciousness,

01:26:24.722 --> 01:26:26.493
or experience or subjective states.

01:26:26.493 --> 01:26:27.554
What is it like,

01:26:27.554 --> 01:26:28.387
to be a computer?
- Can it ever have,

01:26:28.387 --> 01:26:29.220
awareness?

01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:32.202
- Well now we get to the
touring test everybody.

01:26:32.202 --> 01:26:33.453
I said the touring test guys,

01:26:33.453 --> 01:26:34.286
just 'cause I could.

01:26:34.286 --> 01:26:35.119
- That was pretty impressive.

01:26:35.119 --> 01:26:35.952
- Thanks.

01:26:35.952 --> 01:26:37.461
(clapping)

01:26:37.461 --> 01:26:39.914
(laughing)

01:26:39.914 --> 01:26:42.002
- Some great science fiction storytelling,

01:26:42.002 --> 01:26:44.514
involves power of the mind,

01:26:44.514 --> 01:26:47.847
telekinesis, mind control, mind reading.

01:26:50.051 --> 01:26:52.104
Is that, is anyone working on this?

01:26:52.104 --> 01:26:53.413
Is it in the future?

01:26:53.413 --> 01:26:56.033
Or is it just a pipe dream?

01:26:56.033 --> 01:26:57.384
- Yeah so, well there's studies,

01:26:57.384 --> 01:26:59.162
let's say something like mind reading.

01:26:59.162 --> 01:27:01.682
There's studies now where you,

01:27:01.682 --> 01:27:02.653
put someone in a scanner,

01:27:02.653 --> 01:27:04.002
and you show them different pictures,

01:27:04.002 --> 01:27:04.835
or even movies,

01:27:04.835 --> 01:27:07.544
and you see what the neural
signature is of that.

01:27:07.544 --> 01:27:09.373
And then you again put
them in the scanner,

01:27:09.373 --> 01:27:11.264
and the experimenter doesn't
know what they're looking at.

01:27:11.264 --> 01:27:13.424
They're only reading out
their brain activation.

01:27:13.424 --> 01:27:15.434
And they can very reliably predict,

01:27:15.434 --> 01:27:16.914
what the person is seeing.

01:27:16.914 --> 01:27:18.464
And then if you take that a step back,

01:27:18.464 --> 01:27:20.962
and you can even look at
what a person is imagining.

01:27:20.962 --> 01:27:22.594
So over time,

01:27:22.594 --> 01:27:24.034
the more precise this gets,

01:27:24.034 --> 01:27:25.022
I can definitely envision,

01:27:25.022 --> 01:27:26.303
someone just reading someone's,

01:27:26.303 --> 01:27:27.803
neural activation,

01:27:28.713 --> 01:27:30.782
and predicting what it is
they're thinking about.

01:27:30.782 --> 01:27:33.661
- So, you'd have to walk
around with some kind of,

01:27:33.661 --> 01:27:34.994
neuro map visor,

01:27:36.482 --> 01:27:38.922
so that you can detect if
someone is being turned on,

01:27:38.922 --> 01:27:42.402
or turned off or be
highly useful socially.

01:27:42.402 --> 01:27:43.941
- [Heather] Yeah, yeah,
if you're autistic--

01:27:43.941 --> 01:27:45.034
- So you're describing like,

01:27:45.034 --> 01:27:47.480
super extreme guesstimation.

01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:48.784
Like meaning not mind reading,

01:27:48.784 --> 01:27:50.642
you're just talking
about a very very very,

01:27:50.642 --> 01:27:51.475
perceptive person.

01:27:51.475 --> 01:27:52.642
- You could be wrong.

01:27:52.642 --> 01:27:54.242
The better the technology,

01:27:54.242 --> 01:27:55.234
the more we understand about the brain,

01:27:55.234 --> 01:27:56.904
the closer you will be to getting right.

01:27:56.904 --> 01:27:59.434
- But successful charlatans or,

01:27:59.434 --> 01:28:01.304
so called mentalists or magicians,

01:28:01.304 --> 01:28:02.392
they have this ability,

01:28:02.392 --> 01:28:03.812
at some very reasonable level,

01:28:03.812 --> 01:28:05.091
well probably through facials.

01:28:05.091 --> 01:28:05.924
Go ahead.

01:28:05.924 --> 01:28:09.602
- Well yeah, there's a lot of subtly that,

01:28:09.602 --> 01:28:11.034
that's not mind reading right.

01:28:11.034 --> 01:28:13.738
That's a very subtle fine tuning,

01:28:13.738 --> 01:28:16.813
into body language, gesturing,

01:28:16.813 --> 01:28:19.154
shifting of basically
the air around people.

01:28:19.154 --> 01:28:22.685
But there's nothing
magical, mystical about it.

01:28:22.685 --> 01:28:24.044
- Your grandmother is here and she agrees.

01:28:24.044 --> 01:28:26.294
(laughing)

01:28:29.344 --> 01:28:30.177
- I'm getting something,

01:28:30.177 --> 01:28:31.294
I'm getting something.

01:28:31.294 --> 01:28:32.127
(laughing)

01:28:32.127 --> 01:28:36.127
does anyone having trouble
with their white car,

01:28:37.392 --> 01:28:38.225
a white car?

01:28:38.225 --> 01:28:39.656
(laughing)

01:28:39.656 --> 01:28:40.968
- But I'm sorry,

01:28:40.968 --> 01:28:42.498
if we take what you're
talking about Heather,

01:28:42.498 --> 01:28:44.197
maybe 10 steps further.

01:28:44.197 --> 01:28:45.717
Is it possible in the future,

01:28:45.717 --> 01:28:48.738
it would be possible to kind
of record your consciousness,

01:28:48.738 --> 01:28:50.356
and then market that as,

01:28:50.356 --> 01:28:53.157
I would be able to live as you for a day,

01:28:53.157 --> 01:28:56.818
through a sort of VR,
virtual reality playback.

01:28:56.818 --> 01:28:58.357
- Ooh.

01:28:58.357 --> 01:28:59.288
- I don't know if you could ever,

01:28:59.288 --> 01:29:00.428
that's a very,

01:29:00.428 --> 01:29:01.538
philosophical question.
- Just say yes.

01:29:01.538 --> 01:29:03.429
(laughing)

01:29:03.429 --> 01:29:04.262
- I tell you what,

01:29:04.262 --> 01:29:05.095
I would--

01:29:05.095 --> 01:29:07.762
- I want to be a lady for a day.

01:29:09.888 --> 01:29:13.928
- Guys, I would buy that
URL right now my man.

01:29:13.928 --> 01:29:15.808
Ground floor.

01:29:15.808 --> 01:29:16.789
- But actually another study,

01:29:16.789 --> 01:29:17.957
that I'm involved in,

01:29:17.957 --> 01:29:19.858
we're doing something
called hyper scanning,

01:29:19.858 --> 01:29:20.714
or dual scanning,

01:29:20.714 --> 01:29:23.189
where we can scan two
people at the same time,

01:29:23.189 --> 01:29:24.405
having an interaction.

01:29:24.405 --> 01:29:25.426
And kind of seeing what's happening,

01:29:25.426 --> 01:29:27.218
in the space between two people.

01:29:27.218 --> 01:29:28.186
Because as I said before,

01:29:28.186 --> 01:29:29.378
I can never get into your brain,

01:29:29.378 --> 01:29:30.466
or really know what you're thinking.

01:29:30.466 --> 01:29:31.955
And that's what communication is.

01:29:31.955 --> 01:29:33.117
It's about the space between,

01:29:33.117 --> 01:29:34.876
and now we're seeing what's
happening in your brain,

01:29:34.876 --> 01:29:36.386
when you're actually really taking in,

01:29:36.386 --> 01:29:37.957
what I'm saying and vice versa.

01:29:37.957 --> 01:29:38.818
- And also, much as,

01:29:38.818 --> 01:29:42.858
as scientists I'm sure
we'd all agree, yeah.

01:29:42.858 --> 01:29:43.997
(laughing)

01:29:43.997 --> 01:29:46.768
There are things that we can't
see and we can't understand,

01:29:46.768 --> 01:29:48.906
but there are also things that
we know now as scientists,

01:29:48.906 --> 01:29:50.157
things like pheromones.

01:29:50.157 --> 01:29:51.258
There are things that occur,

01:29:51.258 --> 01:29:53.088
for example between two people,

01:29:53.088 --> 01:29:54.928
that are not necessarily detectable,

01:29:54.928 --> 01:29:56.466
in all the other ways we're looking,

01:29:56.466 --> 01:29:57.545
but there's something that happens,

01:29:57.545 --> 01:29:59.168
that again we don't need to write off,

01:29:59.168 --> 01:30:00.505
as magical and mystical.

01:30:00.505 --> 01:30:01.954
We may not be able to measure it yet,

01:30:01.954 --> 01:30:04.437
but yes I think we'll
get there in more ways.

01:30:04.437 --> 01:30:05.344
- Okay so let me ask,

01:30:05.344 --> 01:30:08.261
end the show with this exploration.

01:30:11.496 --> 01:30:14.085
Heather you're on really,

01:30:14.085 --> 01:30:16.844
dare I say, dangerous territory,

01:30:16.844 --> 01:30:18.885
because the more you
know what the brain is,

01:30:18.885 --> 01:30:20.325
and what it does,

01:30:20.325 --> 01:30:21.456
as a scientist,

01:30:21.456 --> 01:30:22.957
what any scientist wants to do,

01:30:22.957 --> 01:30:23.790
at the end of the day,

01:30:23.790 --> 01:30:25.165
is control it.

01:30:25.165 --> 01:30:27.765
You want, that's the
evidence that you know,

01:30:27.765 --> 01:30:28.946
what it is you're doing.

01:30:28.946 --> 01:30:29.924
- You want to make predictions.

01:30:29.924 --> 01:30:32.192
- Make predictions,

01:30:32.192 --> 01:30:33.386
have those predictions come true,

01:30:33.386 --> 01:30:35.394
and say I know how this thing works.

01:30:35.394 --> 01:30:38.888
So if the brain is your laboratory,

01:30:38.888 --> 01:30:40.544
and you say oh here's this,

01:30:40.544 --> 01:30:42.557
I've just discovered
what makes two people,

01:30:42.557 --> 01:30:43.837
fall in love,

01:30:43.837 --> 01:30:45.957
now you make a love potion number nine,

01:30:45.957 --> 01:30:47.847
and you control,

01:30:47.847 --> 01:30:49.912
people's behavior and conduct.

01:30:49.912 --> 01:30:52.328
Do you have another team of ethicists,

01:30:52.328 --> 01:30:54.976
behind you looking over your shoulder,

01:30:54.976 --> 01:30:56.309
at your conduct?

01:30:57.288 --> 01:30:59.014
- Bah ha ha ha ha.

01:30:59.014 --> 01:31:01.848
(laughing)

01:31:01.848 --> 01:31:03.406
- Yes it's the CIA.

01:31:03.406 --> 01:31:05.656
(laughing)

01:31:06.625 --> 01:31:08.675
- There's a whole field of neuro ethics,

01:31:08.675 --> 01:31:10.167
which are talking about issues.

01:31:10.167 --> 01:31:11.448
But yes, I mean ultimately,

01:31:11.448 --> 01:31:13.426
what we going is from correlation,

01:31:13.426 --> 01:31:14.259
to causation.

01:31:14.259 --> 01:31:15.266
When I say we're going into the brain,

01:31:15.266 --> 01:31:16.437
and implanting electrodes,

01:31:16.437 --> 01:31:18.317
for a good cause, to
treat psychiatric illness,

01:31:18.317 --> 01:31:19.997
we're controlling emotions.

01:31:19.997 --> 01:31:21.808
If somebody who was a psychopath--

01:31:21.808 --> 01:31:23.026
- Well emotions that
are social regressive.

01:31:23.026 --> 01:31:23.957
- Yeah.

01:31:23.957 --> 01:31:25.665
- But you can actually, yeah.

01:31:25.665 --> 01:31:27.525
I mean if we know exactly
what the right formula is,

01:31:27.525 --> 01:31:29.288
for say love, I mean people will,

01:31:29.288 --> 01:31:30.853
you can stimulate an emotion in someone,

01:31:30.853 --> 01:31:33.856
and they'll label it as love.

01:31:33.856 --> 01:31:36.426
But no one's there overlooking
my shoulder saying,

01:31:36.426 --> 01:31:39.386
there is an IRB, there's a board that--

01:31:39.386 --> 01:31:40.219
- IRB?

01:31:40.219 --> 01:31:41.052
- Yeah,

01:31:41.052 --> 01:31:42.176
- [Both] Institutional Review Board.

01:31:42.176 --> 01:31:43.009
- Yes.

01:31:43.009 --> 01:31:44.005
(laughing)

01:31:44.005 --> 01:31:45.946
- That makes sure that you
don't make people fall in love,

01:31:45.946 --> 01:31:46.944
when they're not supposed to.

01:31:46.944 --> 01:31:49.736
(laughing)

01:31:49.736 --> 01:31:51.946
- [Heather] Exactly.

01:31:51.946 --> 01:31:52.797
- I feel super safe.

01:31:52.797 --> 01:31:54.805
(laughing)

01:31:54.805 --> 01:31:55.956
- Okay so,

01:31:55.956 --> 01:31:57.693
but the day will surely come where,

01:31:57.693 --> 01:32:01.176
you can make someone smarter
if they can afford to pay you.

01:32:01.176 --> 01:32:03.443
You could cure them if
they can afford that.

01:32:03.443 --> 01:32:05.976
You have all kinds of
neurological disorders.

01:32:05.976 --> 01:32:08.136
I'm just wondering,

01:32:08.136 --> 01:32:09.136
what is the,

01:32:10.034 --> 01:32:11.165
dystopic future of this,

01:32:11.165 --> 01:32:13.946
and what is the utopic future of this?

01:32:13.946 --> 01:32:15.285
- Well one issue is that,

01:32:15.285 --> 01:32:17.104
it could be that only
people who can afford,

01:32:17.104 --> 01:32:18.821
let's say the neuro implants, get them,

01:32:18.821 --> 01:32:20.144
and then they have an advantage.

01:32:20.144 --> 01:32:21.805
And then everybody will have to,

01:32:21.805 --> 01:32:24.424
so like performance
enhancing drugs in sports.

01:32:24.424 --> 01:32:25.323
The reason they outlaw them,

01:32:25.323 --> 01:32:26.156
is 'cause if one person has it,

01:32:26.156 --> 01:32:27.954
they have the advantage every
one else has to do it then.

01:32:27.954 --> 01:32:28.933
- Same with mental illness right,

01:32:28.933 --> 01:32:30.354
in terms of access to mental health care,

01:32:30.354 --> 01:32:31.187
and mental--

01:32:31.187 --> 01:32:32.020
- Exactly.

01:32:32.020 --> 01:32:32.853
I mean exactly.

01:32:32.853 --> 01:32:33.686
- One person has a mental illness,

01:32:33.686 --> 01:32:34.519
everybody else feels like,

01:32:34.519 --> 01:32:35.352
they have to have a mental illness.

01:32:35.352 --> 01:32:37.664
(laughing)

01:32:37.664 --> 01:32:38.573
- No but we're,

01:32:38.573 --> 01:32:41.802
I think what you're getting at,

01:32:41.802 --> 01:32:43.413
there's a dangerous
possibility of sort of,

01:32:43.413 --> 01:32:45.773
narrowing the field of who is well,

01:32:45.773 --> 01:32:46.606
who is smart,

01:32:46.606 --> 01:32:47.913
who is desirable,

01:32:47.913 --> 01:32:49.282
who is accessible,

01:32:49.282 --> 01:32:50.624
who gets access to care.

01:32:50.624 --> 01:32:52.744
That, not to bring it down at the end,

01:32:52.744 --> 01:32:54.024
but that could be dangerous.

01:32:54.024 --> 01:32:55.282
(laughing)

01:32:55.282 --> 01:32:56.115
- Yeah.

01:32:56.115 --> 01:32:56.948
And so,

01:32:56.948 --> 01:32:57.781
let me ask each one of you,

01:32:57.781 --> 01:32:59.861
what's the scariest
future of neuroscience,

01:32:59.861 --> 01:33:01.101
you can think of.

01:33:01.101 --> 01:33:02.321
- Well can't we end on a positive note.

01:33:02.321 --> 01:33:03.154
- Oh on a positive note,

01:33:03.154 --> 01:33:03.987
okay, okay.

01:33:03.987 --> 01:33:05.737
Alright, what is the,

01:33:07.554 --> 01:33:09.042
you work in this field.

01:33:09.042 --> 01:33:10.784
What is 50 years in the future,

01:33:10.784 --> 01:33:14.194
what is that world gifted to us,

01:33:14.194 --> 01:33:15.994
by you and your research colleagues,

01:33:15.994 --> 01:33:17.754
50 years from now, what is that?

01:33:17.754 --> 01:33:18.794
- Well what I would hope,

01:33:18.794 --> 01:33:21.800
is that we can really
have a full scale map,

01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:22.633
of the human brain,

01:33:22.633 --> 01:33:24.482
going all the way from the genome to,

01:33:24.482 --> 01:33:26.642
function and to mind and brain.

01:33:26.642 --> 01:33:28.504
And once we have this
full map of the brain,

01:33:28.504 --> 01:33:29.337
and how it works,

01:33:29.337 --> 01:33:32.202
then we can help prevent
things like Alzheimer's.

01:33:32.202 --> 01:33:33.482
So rather than looking at treatments,

01:33:33.482 --> 01:33:34.641
we're gonna look at prevention.

01:33:34.641 --> 01:33:37.362
If you can go in and
tweak the genome a bit,

01:33:37.362 --> 01:33:39.693
so that people don't get these
kinds of mental disorders,

01:33:39.693 --> 01:33:41.474
to begin with, then we don't
even have to worry so much,

01:33:41.474 --> 01:33:42.933
about the treatment side of things.

01:33:42.933 --> 01:33:44.314
So that would be wonderful.

01:33:44.314 --> 01:33:45.664
- So you can you treat the genome,

01:33:45.664 --> 01:33:48.314
in an adult.
(clapping)

01:33:48.314 --> 01:33:49.154
Can you treat the genome in an adult,

01:33:49.154 --> 01:33:52.234
and then that fixes
their brain as an adult?

01:33:52.234 --> 01:33:53.562
- That would be great if
we could do that yeah.

01:33:53.562 --> 01:33:55.554
If we could even do it in
an adult, to change it.

01:33:55.554 --> 01:33:57.772
- I gotta ask though,

01:33:57.772 --> 01:34:00.424
from an evolutionary standpoint,

01:34:00.424 --> 01:34:01.674
why is it that,

01:34:02.544 --> 01:34:06.621
a genetic, that mental illness persists,

01:34:06.621 --> 01:34:08.131
if it's really especially dangerous,

01:34:08.131 --> 01:34:10.962
wouldn't it have be
eliminated from the gene pool?

01:34:10.962 --> 01:34:13.892
So I suspect it's not
in the biggest picture,

01:34:13.892 --> 01:34:15.559
that deadly to have,

01:34:16.464 --> 01:34:18.234
a mental illness,

01:34:18.234 --> 01:34:19.784
if it's manageable.

01:34:19.784 --> 01:34:22.082
That is to say, germs and parasites,

01:34:22.082 --> 01:34:23.394
are much more likely to kill you,

01:34:23.394 --> 01:34:25.642
than being mentally.

01:34:25.642 --> 01:34:26.475
- [Neil] Unstable.

01:34:26.475 --> 01:34:27.424
- Different.

01:34:27.424 --> 01:34:28.257
And so,

01:34:29.394 --> 01:34:30.773
I just wonder about this whole thing,

01:34:30.773 --> 01:34:32.504
when you go to predict the future,

01:34:32.504 --> 01:34:34.422
without taking into account,

01:34:34.422 --> 01:34:37.642
let's say the flu that
killed more people in 1918,

01:34:37.642 --> 01:34:39.743
than World War I did.

01:34:39.743 --> 01:34:41.041
And so,

01:34:41.041 --> 01:34:41.874
the other thing is this is,

01:34:41.874 --> 01:34:45.242
these questions I think are really only,

01:34:45.242 --> 01:34:46.994
access only useful,

01:34:46.994 --> 01:34:48.834
to a society that can afford it.

01:34:48.834 --> 01:34:50.161
Right,

01:34:50.161 --> 01:34:51.850
the people that,

01:34:51.850 --> 01:34:54.213
are more successful at having,

01:34:54.213 --> 01:34:57.042
an overall health in their
tribe, or their society,

01:34:57.042 --> 01:34:58.693
might do better than,

01:34:58.693 --> 01:34:59.526
the one that can get a few--

01:34:59.526 --> 01:35:00.842
- Just in terms of quality of life,

01:35:00.842 --> 01:35:01.861
well there are two things there.

01:35:01.861 --> 01:35:03.173
One is that certain things do persist,

01:35:03.173 --> 01:35:05.562
for example being a sensation seeker,

01:35:05.562 --> 01:35:06.714
being really impulsive.

01:35:06.714 --> 01:35:08.463
That's a quality that
got people out there,

01:35:08.463 --> 01:35:09.893
and discovered America right.

01:35:09.893 --> 01:35:11.813
These kinds of traits
which we might call--

01:35:11.813 --> 01:35:13.464
- By the way that probably
killed more people,

01:35:13.464 --> 01:35:15.664
than who actually survived and came back.

01:35:15.664 --> 01:35:17.719
- Autistic ability and
mental illness, right.

01:35:17.719 --> 01:35:19.184
- Yeah I mean there's not,

01:35:19.184 --> 01:35:20.354
and that's to say that
everything with mental illness.

01:35:20.354 --> 01:35:22.876
There are some positive
things about being at,

01:35:22.876 --> 01:35:27.156
the extreme ends of what
we consider to be normal.

01:35:27.156 --> 01:35:28.666
There is no such thing as normal.

01:35:28.666 --> 01:35:30.556
But what studies do show,

01:35:30.556 --> 01:35:34.066
is that the most amount of any disease,

01:35:34.066 --> 01:35:36.444
cancer, all sorts of
physiological diseases,

01:35:36.444 --> 01:35:38.676
the thing that causes people the most,

01:35:38.676 --> 01:35:40.494
poorest, lowest quality
of life and distress,

01:35:40.494 --> 01:35:41.575
are mental illness,

01:35:41.575 --> 01:35:42.865
because they don't die from it,

01:35:42.865 --> 01:35:44.643
but they have to suffer their lives.

01:35:44.643 --> 01:35:45.882
- And often they,

01:35:45.882 --> 01:35:48.683
have children and pass
on genes that maybe,

01:35:48.683 --> 01:35:50.156
predisposing to,

01:35:50.156 --> 01:35:51.354
future mental illnesses.

01:35:51.354 --> 01:35:52.946
It's a really sad discussion.

01:35:52.946 --> 01:35:55.094
I mean we're trying to
find something uplifting.

01:35:55.094 --> 01:35:56.956
- We got to wrap this up.

01:35:56.956 --> 01:35:57.789
So, Mayim,

01:35:58.804 --> 01:36:00.094
I'm like depressing now.

01:36:00.094 --> 01:36:02.215
(laughing)

01:36:02.215 --> 01:36:04.048
What's in your future?

01:36:05.823 --> 01:36:07.745
- Personally, or in the
field of neuroscience?

01:36:07.745 --> 01:36:08.578
What do you mean?

01:36:08.578 --> 01:36:09.464
- Yeah your personal future.

01:36:09.464 --> 01:36:10.802
- Oh, you're looking at it.

01:36:10.802 --> 01:36:13.396
(laughing)

01:36:13.396 --> 01:36:14.604
No I mean like whatever.

01:36:14.604 --> 01:36:15.437
I have this book.

01:36:15.437 --> 01:36:16.584
It's called Mayim's Vegan Table.

01:36:16.584 --> 01:36:17.535
I work on the Big Bang Theory,

01:36:17.535 --> 01:36:19.596
and I have two kids and that's my life.

01:36:19.596 --> 01:36:20.429
(laughing)

01:36:20.429 --> 01:36:21.262
- Well 50 years from now,

01:36:21.262 --> 01:36:23.095
what is neuroscience
gonna be doing for us.

01:36:23.095 --> 01:36:24.386
- Well he said personally,

01:36:24.386 --> 01:36:25.225
not neuroscience.

01:36:25.225 --> 01:36:26.143
- Right, right.

01:36:26.143 --> 01:36:26.976
Good, good.

01:36:26.976 --> 01:36:27.809
- I was a good listener.

01:36:27.809 --> 01:36:29.614
(laughing)

01:36:29.614 --> 01:36:30.447
- I can measure that actually.

01:36:30.447 --> 01:36:31.375
- I'm sorry what did you say?

01:36:31.375 --> 01:36:33.625
(laughing)

01:36:35.284 --> 01:36:39.306
- Let me offer some sort
of concluding remarks here.

01:36:39.306 --> 01:36:40.984
I think we,

01:36:40.984 --> 01:36:42.575
I study the universe.

01:36:42.575 --> 01:36:45.234
And the interesting thing is that,

01:36:45.234 --> 01:36:47.106
there's this universe inside our heads,

01:36:47.106 --> 01:36:49.746
that is perhaps less well known,

01:36:49.746 --> 01:36:51.829
than the universe that's,

01:36:52.703 --> 01:36:54.922
extends back to the Big Bang and time,

01:36:54.922 --> 01:36:55.755
and space.

01:36:57.164 --> 01:36:58.875
And so, it's curious,

01:36:58.875 --> 01:37:00.946
maybe the big challenge here is,

01:37:00.946 --> 01:37:01.779
studying,

01:37:04.466 --> 01:37:07.095
you're using your own
brain to study a brain.

01:37:07.095 --> 01:37:10.004
You're not some other
entity studying the brain.

01:37:10.004 --> 01:37:12.524
And that prevents some questions perhaps,

01:37:12.524 --> 01:37:13.996
from even being asked.

01:37:13.996 --> 01:37:15.604
'Cause you don't even
know the right question,

01:37:15.604 --> 01:37:19.026
because the brain is asking
the question about the brain.

01:37:19.026 --> 01:37:20.946
And,
(laughing)

01:37:20.946 --> 01:37:23.004
Karl Sagan is famous for,

01:37:23.004 --> 01:37:24.337
the saying that,

01:37:25.439 --> 01:37:27.724
humans, conscious humans,

01:37:27.724 --> 01:37:31.224
are a way for the universe to know itself.

01:37:32.386 --> 01:37:36.274
And that we're not the
universe, we're in the universe,

01:37:36.274 --> 01:37:38.074
and we use our brain power,

01:37:38.074 --> 01:37:39.495
to decode the universe.

01:37:39.495 --> 01:37:42.495
I'm just intrigued by the fact that,

01:37:43.455 --> 01:37:46.026
the real future here might
just be in our minds.

01:37:46.026 --> 01:37:47.874
And maybe we will learn,

01:37:47.874 --> 01:37:49.906
what questions we're not asking yet.

01:37:49.906 --> 01:37:51.634
And those are the questions that,

01:37:51.634 --> 01:37:53.924
keep me going everyday.

01:37:53.924 --> 01:37:56.474
Because that's the future of discovery,

01:37:56.474 --> 01:37:57.775
in any field.

01:37:57.775 --> 01:38:00.364
So, join me giving a very warm thank you,

01:38:00.364 --> 01:38:02.622
to this brilliant panel.
(clapping)

01:38:02.622 --> 01:38:03.485
(cheering)
(clapping)

01:38:03.485 --> 01:38:04.704
- That was cool man.

01:38:04.704 --> 01:38:05.674
Great job.

01:38:05.674 --> 01:38:07.285
Great job, great job man.

01:38:07.285 --> 01:38:08.986
Great job.
- It was fun.

01:38:08.986 --> 01:38:11.655
(clapping)

01:38:11.655 --> 01:38:12.945
Great job you guys.

01:38:12.945 --> 01:38:15.157
I just thought it was cool.

01:38:15.157 --> 01:38:16.077
Cool.

01:38:16.077 --> 01:38:18.327
(clapping)

01:38:27.096 --> 01:38:28.763
- It's Q and A time.

01:38:29.717 --> 01:38:31.847
We have some microphones on the aisles.

01:38:31.847 --> 01:38:34.138
We can bring up the house
lights maybe to half.

01:38:34.138 --> 01:38:35.727
And,

01:38:35.727 --> 01:38:37.606
what we prefer is just,

01:38:37.606 --> 01:38:39.567
find one person to direct the question to,

01:38:39.567 --> 01:38:42.185
'cause if all 12 of us answer,

01:38:42.185 --> 01:38:43.266
it takes all night.

01:38:43.266 --> 01:38:44.567
So if you can be specific about it.

01:38:44.567 --> 01:38:46.047
Sir, you're up front.

01:38:46.047 --> 01:38:46.905
- [Audience Member] Hey, how are you doin?

01:38:46.905 --> 01:38:47.738
- Hello.

01:38:47.738 --> 01:38:49.618
- [Audience Member] So you
talked a little bit about,

01:38:49.618 --> 01:38:52.754
the idea of there's these
people super humans, right,

01:38:52.754 --> 01:38:54.266
and so there are people out there,

01:38:54.266 --> 01:38:56.965
who have what I think is
called savant syndrome,

01:38:56.965 --> 01:38:59.407
who have some kind of
amazing mental abilities.

01:38:59.407 --> 01:39:01.927
They can like learn new
languages in a week,

01:39:01.927 --> 01:39:03.687
or do really rapid calculations.

01:39:03.687 --> 01:39:05.797
So what's different about
these people's brains?

01:39:05.797 --> 01:39:09.317
Is this something we all have
inherently able in our brains,

01:39:09.317 --> 01:39:12.984
and could we hack it
to enable that ability?

01:39:13.876 --> 01:39:14.985
- Wait, wait, I recognize that question.

01:39:14.985 --> 01:39:17.047
You're the guy who won
this contest aren't you?

01:39:17.047 --> 01:39:18.458
Yes he won a contest.

01:39:18.458 --> 01:39:20.098
So thank you.

01:39:20.098 --> 01:39:20.931
- [Audience Member] Oh your welcome.

01:39:20.931 --> 01:39:22.077
- Yeah and they put you first on the line.

01:39:22.077 --> 01:39:23.026
- [Audience Member]
They told me to rush up.

01:39:23.026 --> 01:39:23.859
- Excellent.

01:39:23.859 --> 01:39:24.692
Excellent.

01:39:24.692 --> 01:39:25.525
(laughing)

01:39:25.525 --> 01:39:26.447
Okay great question.

01:39:26.447 --> 01:39:29.266
I think we all want some
of that ability right.

01:39:29.266 --> 01:39:30.818
So what's up with that?

01:39:30.818 --> 01:39:32.858
(laughing)

01:39:32.858 --> 01:39:35.437
- How can we all become magic?

01:39:35.437 --> 01:39:36.270
- I don't have all the answers.

01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:38.178
But I think what savants is what,

01:39:38.178 --> 01:39:40.017
they seem to be wired
slightly differently.

01:39:40.017 --> 01:39:41.898
And so, they seem to have these usually,

01:39:41.898 --> 01:39:44.218
these isolated areas of specialization.

01:39:44.218 --> 01:39:45.186
But sometimes at the cost,

01:39:45.186 --> 01:39:47.157
of other parts of the brain,

01:39:47.157 --> 01:39:48.658
development of other parts of the brain.

01:39:48.658 --> 01:39:50.741
So, it's not necessarily,

01:39:51.954 --> 01:39:53.976
a good thing to be very very good,

01:39:53.976 --> 01:39:54.809
at just one thing,

01:39:54.809 --> 01:39:57.526
and at the cost of other things.

01:39:57.526 --> 01:40:00.149
And, the only way I think we can,

01:40:00.149 --> 01:40:02.447
enhance our cognitive abilities,

01:40:02.447 --> 01:40:04.477
is with working at it.

01:40:04.477 --> 01:40:05.310
And it's like anything.

01:40:05.310 --> 01:40:06.778
Like with loosing weight,

01:40:06.778 --> 01:40:08.146
you have to work at it.

01:40:08.146 --> 01:40:09.625
So I don't think there's
a sort of magic pill.

01:40:09.625 --> 01:40:12.024
But it has to do with the way
that their brains are wired,

01:40:12.024 --> 01:40:13.117
slightly differently.

01:40:13.117 --> 01:40:14.538
- Okay using the word wiring,

01:40:14.538 --> 01:40:16.386
so in the future you
can adjust the wiring.

01:40:16.386 --> 01:40:17.553
If you have a,

01:40:19.146 --> 01:40:20.237
savant,

01:40:20.237 --> 01:40:22.418
is there an ethical question,

01:40:22.418 --> 01:40:26.178
about whether you would
change that about that person?

01:40:26.178 --> 01:40:27.197
- Yeah I think there is.

01:40:27.197 --> 01:40:28.386
I think it's a,

01:40:28.386 --> 01:40:29.538
I mean it's like with anything,

01:40:29.538 --> 01:40:31.877
even with a psychopath,

01:40:31.877 --> 01:40:33.298
they don't come in for treatment.

01:40:33.298 --> 01:40:34.131
- [Neil] As she gestures to.

01:40:34.131 --> 01:40:36.716
(laughing)

01:40:36.716 --> 01:40:38.299
- Even psychopaths,

01:40:39.283 --> 01:40:40.656
need to be asked.
- They might enjoy,

01:40:40.656 --> 01:40:41.546
being that way.

01:40:41.546 --> 01:40:42.862
So if they're not a
threat to other people,

01:40:42.862 --> 01:40:44.553
or if they're not in distress,

01:40:44.553 --> 01:40:47.132
I don't think that we should
go around just changing people,

01:40:47.132 --> 01:40:48.916
for the sake of it.

01:40:48.916 --> 01:40:49.884
- Question here yes.

01:40:49.884 --> 01:40:51.014
- [Audience Member] Yeah so since we have,

01:40:51.014 --> 01:40:52.364
the comedians here,

01:40:52.364 --> 01:40:53.366
I don't know if you guys,

01:40:53.366 --> 01:40:54.945
have thought a lot about the intersection,

01:40:54.945 --> 01:40:57.596
between comedy and neuroscience.

01:40:57.596 --> 01:40:58.429
- I have yes.

01:40:58.429 --> 01:40:59.262
- Yeah.

01:40:59.262 --> 01:41:00.134
(laughing)

01:41:00.134 --> 01:41:03.453
I wrote a paper on the physiology
of laughter in college.

01:41:03.453 --> 01:41:04.465
- [Audience Member] Great yeah, so--

01:41:04.465 --> 01:41:06.325
- [Neil] Actually he did.

01:41:06.325 --> 01:41:08.056
- It was all wrong but yes I did write it.

01:41:08.056 --> 01:41:09.317
(laughing)

01:41:09.317 --> 01:41:10.327
I wrote the shit out of it.

01:41:10.327 --> 01:41:11.258
- Alright perfect,

01:41:11.258 --> 01:41:13.207
you know these guys are up here,

01:41:13.207 --> 01:41:15.538
providing great comedic interjection,

01:41:15.538 --> 01:41:17.298
and not everyone can do that,

01:41:17.298 --> 01:41:19.930
like not every brain works that way.

01:41:19.930 --> 01:41:22.130
So maybe we could hear
from like one comedian,

01:41:22.130 --> 01:41:24.547
and one neuroscientist like why.

01:41:24.547 --> 01:41:26.008
- Or how about a neuroscientist
who is a comedian?

01:41:26.008 --> 01:41:26.938
- [Audience Member] Or yeah yeah.

01:41:26.938 --> 01:41:28.999
Well I can't ask all of you, so who.

01:41:28.999 --> 01:41:29.832
- Yes no, please.

01:41:29.832 --> 01:41:30.669
- So Mayim go.

01:41:30.669 --> 01:41:32.730
- [Audience Member] Why are they funny?

01:41:32.730 --> 01:41:33.690
Why are you guys funny?

01:41:33.690 --> 01:41:34.930
(laughing)

01:41:34.930 --> 01:41:35.949
- I don't know if I can answer that,

01:41:35.949 --> 01:41:37.628
but I can say that--

01:41:37.628 --> 01:41:38.858
- [Neil] Can I add that,

01:41:38.858 --> 01:41:41.757
when she wouldn't say this about herself,

01:41:41.757 --> 01:41:43.530
on the Big Bang Theory,

01:41:43.530 --> 01:41:45.613
her timing is impeccable.

01:41:46.509 --> 01:41:47.342
- [Woman] She was Blossom.

01:41:47.342 --> 01:41:49.319
(laughing)

01:41:49.319 --> 01:41:50.250
- That's my mother.

01:41:50.250 --> 01:41:51.083
Thank you mom.

01:41:51.083 --> 01:41:53.972
(laughing)

01:41:53.972 --> 01:41:54.805
- [Eugene] Wait what?

01:41:54.805 --> 01:41:56.293
- Yes from 1991, to 1994,

01:41:56.293 --> 01:41:58.940
she was Blossom on the show Blossom.

01:41:58.940 --> 01:42:01.190
(cheering)

01:42:02.270 --> 01:42:04.133
And you were the young Bette Midler,

01:42:04.133 --> 01:42:05.052
in the Rose.

01:42:05.052 --> 01:42:06.282
- Yeah, in Beaches.

01:42:06.282 --> 01:42:07.373
- Or Beaches, Beaches, yeah.

01:42:07.373 --> 01:42:10.021
- No I mean, I'm happy to let
you guys also speak to it.

01:42:10.021 --> 01:42:11.093
I mean in terms of,

01:42:11.093 --> 01:42:11.926
what's funny--

01:42:11.926 --> 01:42:12.759
- We're not,

01:42:12.759 --> 01:42:13.592
we want you to speak go.

01:42:13.592 --> 01:42:14.682
- No but in terms of what's funny,

01:42:14.682 --> 01:42:15.671
and why are things funny,

01:42:15.671 --> 01:42:17.930
there is a really
interesting field of sort of,

01:42:17.930 --> 01:42:20.621
understanding the timing of how,

01:42:20.621 --> 01:42:23.501
complicated, it is, it's
complicated social interaction.

01:42:23.501 --> 01:42:24.351
But I think,

01:42:24.351 --> 01:42:27.151
for me as an actor and as a scientist,

01:42:27.151 --> 01:42:28.981
what I'm aware of is
what we constantly do,

01:42:28.981 --> 01:42:31.379
is we're constantly scanning and tracking,

01:42:31.379 --> 01:42:35.041
and it's, people can do
it better than others.

01:42:35.041 --> 01:42:36.381
Stand ups can do something,

01:42:36.381 --> 01:42:37.573
that I can't do, right.

01:42:37.573 --> 01:42:39.253
I can't do improv.

01:42:39.253 --> 01:42:41.173
There's a different set of skills,

01:42:41.173 --> 01:42:43.911
that actors and performers have.

01:42:43.911 --> 01:42:46.333
But the joke that we tend to be neurotic,

01:42:46.333 --> 01:42:48.446
that we tend to be constantly looking,

01:42:48.446 --> 01:42:50.082
to make someone feel something,

01:42:50.082 --> 01:42:52.070
is a very complicated
thing about being an actor.

01:42:52.070 --> 01:42:53.412
And I didn't think about it as much,

01:42:53.412 --> 01:42:54.351
when I was younger.

01:42:54.351 --> 01:42:56.531
But when you meet other actors,

01:42:56.531 --> 01:42:58.071
and when you talk about process,

01:42:58.071 --> 01:42:58.949
which a lot of people laugh.

01:42:58.949 --> 01:43:00.500
They figure like oh
we're paid to be funny,

01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:02.170
or we're paid to make
people believe something,

01:43:02.170 --> 01:43:04.751
it's a very complicated process by which,

01:43:04.751 --> 01:43:06.613
I need to make you feel something.

01:43:06.613 --> 01:43:08.242
I need to make you believe something,

01:43:08.242 --> 01:43:10.882
and I need every single
person to feel that.

01:43:10.882 --> 01:43:12.042
So if you're a standup,

01:43:12.042 --> 01:43:13.750
you're working with a room of people.

01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:15.093
When I work in front of a live audience,

01:43:15.093 --> 01:43:17.861
I need everyone to feel something,

01:43:17.861 --> 01:43:19.461
and it's a really complicated interaction,

01:43:19.461 --> 01:43:20.962
especially if you work
with a live audience.

01:43:20.962 --> 01:43:23.221
It's very different than not.

01:43:23.221 --> 01:43:24.981
Because it is a constant tracking.

01:43:24.981 --> 01:43:26.842
- Heather are comedians subjects of your--

01:43:26.842 --> 01:43:27.675
- Well yeah actually,

01:43:27.675 --> 01:43:29.100
so this is really exciting stuff.

01:43:29.100 --> 01:43:30.789
This is a new area of
research we're going to,

01:43:30.789 --> 01:43:31.765
is actually the neural basis,

01:43:31.765 --> 01:43:33.642
of creativity and improvisation.

01:43:33.642 --> 01:43:36.413
And so, what we find is that,

01:43:36.413 --> 01:43:38.213
whether it's jazz improv,

01:43:38.213 --> 01:43:39.493
or comedy improv,

01:43:39.493 --> 01:43:40.973
there's a certain neural
signature involved,

01:43:40.973 --> 01:43:42.023
when people are improvising.

01:43:42.023 --> 01:43:43.041
So you can put people in a scanner,

01:43:43.041 --> 01:43:45.802
and even freestyle rappers.

01:43:45.802 --> 01:43:47.431
So you give them a memorized rap,

01:43:47.431 --> 01:43:48.871
and then they can freestyle.

01:43:48.871 --> 01:43:51.911
Or you give a musician a
memorized piece or improv.

01:43:51.911 --> 01:43:53.282
And when they're improvising,

01:43:53.282 --> 01:43:54.573
what they find is that,

01:43:54.573 --> 01:43:55.691
a part of the prefrontal cortex,

01:43:55.691 --> 01:43:57.030
the medial prefrontal cortex,

01:43:57.030 --> 01:43:58.143
becomes extra activated,

01:43:58.143 --> 01:44:00.692
and that has to do with
internally generated ideas.

01:44:00.692 --> 01:44:03.282
And the dorsal lateral part
of the prefrontal cortex,

01:44:03.282 --> 01:44:04.413
becomes deactivated,

01:44:04.413 --> 01:44:06.240
and that has to do with
sort of self awareness,

01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:07.351
and monitoring your behavior.

01:44:07.351 --> 01:44:09.453
So you almost go into
this free flowing state.

01:44:09.453 --> 01:44:10.902
If you become too aware,

01:44:10.902 --> 01:44:14.002
you mess up, you're not
good at improvising.

01:44:14.002 --> 01:44:15.773
You have to kind of loose
yourself, so to speak.

01:44:15.773 --> 01:44:17.149
And that's what the neuro imaging shows.

01:44:17.149 --> 01:44:18.733
- I have a follow up.

01:44:18.733 --> 01:44:23.082
Is there any connection
between improv and optimism?

01:44:23.082 --> 01:44:25.031
- I don't know.

01:44:25.031 --> 01:44:27.522
Actually wait, one of the studies showed,

01:44:27.522 --> 01:44:29.471
actually one of the studies showed that,

01:44:29.471 --> 01:44:30.500
when they were improvising,

01:44:30.500 --> 01:44:32.763
they increased activation of the Amygdala,

01:44:32.763 --> 01:44:34.743
which could be related
to positive feelings.

01:44:34.743 --> 01:44:36.142
- [Neil] That's your brain part.

01:44:36.142 --> 01:44:36.983
- That's kind of my thing.

01:44:36.983 --> 01:44:39.724
(laughing)

01:44:39.724 --> 01:44:40.884
- [Neil] That's interesting to know.

01:44:40.884 --> 01:44:42.356
Right here sir.

01:44:42.356 --> 01:44:43.556
- [Audience Member] Yeah hi.

01:44:43.556 --> 01:44:44.389
I have a question,

01:44:44.389 --> 01:44:45.327
actually I have a couple of questions,

01:44:45.327 --> 01:44:47.545
but then when you guys mentioned,

01:44:47.545 --> 01:44:48.436
eugenics.

01:44:48.436 --> 01:44:50.596
(laughing)

01:44:50.596 --> 01:44:52.196
- That's kind of your thing.

01:44:52.196 --> 01:44:54.265
- What's your question Himmler?

01:44:54.265 --> 01:44:56.515
(laughing)

01:44:58.854 --> 01:45:01.271
- [Audience Member] Wow, wow.

01:45:02.535 --> 01:45:04.487
- Too soon, too soon.

01:45:04.487 --> 01:45:05.817
- [Neil] Too soon, too soon.

01:45:05.817 --> 01:45:06.897
(laughing)

01:45:06.897 --> 01:45:07.969
- [Audience Member] Well that
kind of shades my question,

01:45:07.969 --> 01:45:09.569
doesn't it.

01:45:09.569 --> 01:45:11.449
I was actually, all I could think about,

01:45:11.449 --> 01:45:13.400
was the movie Idiocrasy.

01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:14.928
Now I don't know if any of
you guys have seen that.

01:45:14.928 --> 01:45:16.950
(clapping)

01:45:16.950 --> 01:45:21.200
It's kind of a scary look
at what might happen if--

01:45:22.409 --> 01:45:23.601
- If dumb people keep breeding.

01:45:23.601 --> 01:45:24.881
(laughing)

01:45:24.881 --> 01:45:25.888
- [Audience Member] Thank you yes.

01:45:25.888 --> 01:45:28.138
- It's luckily make believe, but go on.

01:45:28.138 --> 01:45:29.471
- [Audience Member]
Okay so my question is,

01:45:29.471 --> 01:45:31.971
to the neuro folks over there.

01:45:34.812 --> 01:45:36.321
I don't know if you've seen anything,

01:45:36.321 --> 01:45:39.105
going in that direction or not or?

01:45:39.105 --> 01:45:41.311
(laughing)

01:45:41.311 --> 01:45:44.431
- Have you seen a genetic predisposition,

01:45:44.431 --> 01:45:45.649
in society to become idiots?

01:45:45.649 --> 01:45:47.899
(laughing)

01:45:52.001 --> 01:45:52.971
- I didn't see the movie,

01:45:52.971 --> 01:45:54.531
so I can't speak to that.

01:45:54.531 --> 01:45:57.051
- Well, this is gonna be,

01:45:57.051 --> 01:45:58.201
I'm trying to be like sort of PC.

01:45:58.201 --> 01:46:00.012
Well, one thing is that,

01:46:00.012 --> 01:46:01.641
with evolution in the past right,

01:46:01.641 --> 01:46:03.660
if it was survival of the fittest,

01:46:03.660 --> 01:46:04.891
then those who just,

01:46:04.891 --> 01:46:05.911
couldn't make it, couldn't make it.

01:46:05.911 --> 01:46:06.751
And they would die out.

01:46:06.751 --> 01:46:08.932
And then there would be certain
traits that would evolve,

01:46:08.932 --> 01:46:10.279
and survive.

01:46:10.279 --> 01:46:12.862
But now, we have all sorts of--

01:46:14.500 --> 01:46:15.719
- Ways to keep those people around.

01:46:15.719 --> 01:46:16.552
- Exactly.

01:46:16.552 --> 01:46:18.900
(laughing)

01:46:18.900 --> 01:46:19.733
It's kind of,

01:46:19.733 --> 01:46:20.566
messing with evolution.
- We keep our diseased,

01:46:20.566 --> 01:46:21.697
idiots alive.

01:46:21.697 --> 01:46:23.947
(laughing)

01:46:25.260 --> 01:46:26.939
- So who knows what's gonna happen.

01:46:26.939 --> 01:46:28.969
- If we were in Washington D.C.,

01:46:28.969 --> 01:46:33.068
there would be a GS
level joke right there.

01:46:33.068 --> 01:46:35.095
- [Neil] Question right here.

01:46:35.095 --> 01:46:36.089
- I have kind of a in depth,

01:46:36.089 --> 01:46:37.208
and specific question,

01:46:37.208 --> 01:46:39.231
I guess to the scientists,

01:46:39.231 --> 01:46:42.260
and I guess to the neuroscientists here,

01:46:42.260 --> 01:46:45.204
based on quantum theories of the mind,

01:46:45.204 --> 01:46:46.809
what's your take on the idea that,

01:46:46.809 --> 01:46:49.780
consciousness originates
at the quantum level,

01:46:49.780 --> 01:46:52.809
and if you're familiar with
Schrodinger's equation,

01:46:52.809 --> 01:46:55.551
the very fact that observing something,

01:46:55.551 --> 01:46:56.521
changes the outcome.

01:46:56.521 --> 01:46:59.898
So the mind observing consciousness,

01:46:59.898 --> 01:47:01.849
what's your guy's take on that?

01:47:01.849 --> 01:47:03.471
- Yeah I can offer
something on that as well.

01:47:03.471 --> 01:47:04.889
So a quantum--

01:47:04.889 --> 01:47:05.860
- The cat is actually dead.

01:47:05.860 --> 01:47:08.009
(laughing)

01:47:08.009 --> 01:47:10.911
- Quantum physics has sort
of mysterious properties,

01:47:10.911 --> 01:47:12.700
that are real.

01:47:12.700 --> 01:47:16.047
But they defy anything
your five sense or more,

01:47:16.047 --> 01:47:17.991
have ever experienced in your life.

01:47:17.991 --> 01:47:19.449
So you say well that's weird.

01:47:19.449 --> 01:47:21.001
But it's real.

01:47:21.001 --> 01:47:21.834
It happens.

01:47:21.834 --> 01:47:24.239
Particles pop in and out of existence.

01:47:24.239 --> 01:47:25.388
You look at it,

01:47:25.388 --> 01:47:27.329
and then it changes into something else.

01:47:27.329 --> 01:47:29.246
This is the behavior of

01:47:30.209 --> 01:47:32.399
the universe on a smallest scale.

01:47:32.399 --> 01:47:34.879
Because it has all these
mysterious properties,

01:47:34.879 --> 01:47:38.428
what I have found in my experience,

01:47:38.428 --> 01:47:40.367
watching people think about the world,

01:47:40.367 --> 01:47:44.108
is they have this urge to
insert quantum physics,

01:47:44.108 --> 01:47:45.647
where there's something where they don't,

01:47:45.647 --> 01:47:47.337
otherwise understand what it is.

01:47:47.337 --> 01:47:48.878
So we don't really
understand consciousness,

01:47:48.878 --> 01:47:51.137
quantum physics must be at work, alright.

01:47:51.137 --> 01:47:52.977
(laughing)

01:47:52.977 --> 01:47:56.428
And in fact the more they
invoke quantum physics,

01:47:56.428 --> 01:47:58.449
that's the evidence that
they know least about,

01:47:58.449 --> 01:48:00.397
what it is they're talking about.

01:48:00.397 --> 01:48:01.230
(laughing)
- Well I admit that.

01:48:01.230 --> 01:48:02.103
I don't know what I'm talking about.

01:48:02.103 --> 01:48:05.183
- But I think the Heisenberg
uncertainty principal,

01:48:05.183 --> 01:48:07.481
I mean I do appreciate this notion,

01:48:07.481 --> 01:48:08.753
that any observation of something,

01:48:08.753 --> 01:48:10.741
alters what it is, how we perceive it,

01:48:10.741 --> 01:48:11.633
how we describe it.

01:48:11.633 --> 01:48:12.633
I appreciate that.
- However,

01:48:12.633 --> 01:48:14.883
(laughing)

01:48:18.501 --> 01:48:20.193
when I observe you,

01:48:20.193 --> 01:48:22.535
you don't pop into a
different quantum state.

01:48:22.535 --> 01:48:25.023
You're a macroscopic entity.

01:48:25.023 --> 01:48:26.106
Large things,

01:48:28.273 --> 01:48:29.106
- [Audience Member] Six foot seven.

01:48:29.106 --> 01:48:31.689
- Average out these principals,

01:48:32.745 --> 01:48:34.724
so that we have a macroscopic world,

01:48:34.724 --> 01:48:38.015
that lends itself to
macroscopic discussions.

01:48:38.015 --> 01:48:38.945
- Just tell him to sit down.

01:48:38.945 --> 01:48:40.745
You just want to tell him to sit down.

01:48:40.745 --> 01:48:44.664
- If we were the size of particles, yes.

01:48:44.664 --> 01:48:47.843
Me, beaming eyes at you with the light,

01:48:47.843 --> 01:48:50.143
would pop you into some
other part of the universe.

01:48:50.143 --> 01:48:51.196
Yes.
(laughing)

01:48:51.196 --> 01:48:52.516
But you are big.

01:48:52.516 --> 01:48:55.034
So it doesn't happen, okay.

01:48:55.034 --> 01:48:56.007
- [Audience Member] Is that a fat joke?

01:48:56.007 --> 01:48:59.047
(laughing)

01:48:59.047 --> 01:49:00.457
- It would be cool.

01:49:00.457 --> 01:49:03.839
It would be cool if we
were like particle size,

01:49:03.839 --> 01:49:07.319
and you walked through a doorway, okay.

01:49:07.319 --> 01:49:09.239
You would diffract, okay.

01:49:09.239 --> 01:49:10.072
(laughing)

01:49:10.072 --> 01:49:11.147
'Cause that's what light does.

01:49:11.147 --> 01:49:12.129
I mean, it'd be funny,

01:49:12.129 --> 01:49:15.999
if planks constant were
much larger than it is,

01:49:15.999 --> 01:49:18.308
weird stuff would happen all the time.

01:49:18.308 --> 01:49:19.759
(laughing)

01:49:19.759 --> 01:49:21.187
Okay, so yeah.

01:49:21.187 --> 01:49:23.289
- Can I just bring it to
the brain for a second?

01:49:23.289 --> 01:49:24.317
Okay so there's a,

01:49:24.317 --> 01:49:25.698
I just want to diffuse this theory.

01:49:25.698 --> 01:49:27.219
'Cause everyone, I
always get this question,

01:49:27.219 --> 01:49:28.199
about the quantum theory.

01:49:28.199 --> 01:49:29.700
And there's this, Roger Penrose,

01:49:29.700 --> 01:49:31.139
who is a mathematician at Oxford,

01:49:31.139 --> 01:49:32.799
and Stewart Hammerhoff,

01:49:32.799 --> 01:49:34.511
who is an anesthesiologist.

01:49:34.511 --> 01:49:35.911
They came up with this theory of quantum,

01:49:35.911 --> 01:49:37.591
the quantum theory of consciousness.

01:49:37.591 --> 01:49:38.831
Basically saying that,

01:49:38.831 --> 01:49:42.139
at some level at the structural level,

01:49:42.139 --> 01:49:43.329
of the neuron,

01:49:43.329 --> 01:49:46.580
is where these quantum effects
can sort of take place,

01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:49.048
and that's where consciousness
lies in the rest of it.

01:49:49.048 --> 01:49:51.339
But there's no evidence for that.

01:49:51.339 --> 01:49:54.407
And also, the temperatures
at which these effects,

01:49:54.407 --> 01:49:55.500
would have to occur,

01:49:55.500 --> 01:49:56.879
they'd have to be cooler
than the temperature,

01:49:56.879 --> 01:49:58.929
that the brain is currently at.

01:49:58.929 --> 01:50:01.420
So there's a lot of things
that go against this idea,

01:50:01.420 --> 01:50:02.990
but again, people tend to want to,

01:50:02.990 --> 01:50:03.900
put together something mysterious,

01:50:03.900 --> 01:50:05.111
with something else mysterious,

01:50:05.111 --> 01:50:05.944
but as far as we know,

01:50:05.944 --> 01:50:07.169
from the field of neuroscience,

01:50:07.169 --> 01:50:08.281
there's no evidence to it.

01:50:08.281 --> 01:50:09.114
- Can I ask a follow up,

01:50:09.114 --> 01:50:09.947
question about this?

01:50:09.947 --> 01:50:11.907
- Okay, only if it's quick, but go.

01:50:11.907 --> 01:50:12.740
- No that's--

01:50:12.740 --> 01:50:13.573
(laughing)

01:50:13.573 --> 01:50:14.406
- [Eugene] It's right behind ya.

01:50:14.406 --> 01:50:15.848
- [Neil] Over here, so it's over here.

01:50:15.848 --> 01:50:18.057
(laughing)

01:50:18.057 --> 01:50:19.590
- And he was very polite to you.

01:50:19.590 --> 01:50:20.423
- I didn't get the,

01:50:20.423 --> 01:50:21.256
- I'm cutting the line.

01:50:21.256 --> 01:50:22.089
- Sorry cut the line.

01:50:22.089 --> 01:50:23.590
- Doesn't this imply this idea,

01:50:23.590 --> 01:50:26.038
does that imply that the
consciousness has mass,

01:50:26.038 --> 01:50:29.338
and do we know that to be true?

01:50:29.338 --> 01:50:30.419
- Ooh.

01:50:30.419 --> 01:50:31.899
- I got to say,

01:50:31.899 --> 01:50:33.728
you guys as an engineer,

01:50:33.728 --> 01:50:34.768
(laughing)

01:50:34.768 --> 01:50:36.991
at some level, you can measure,

01:50:36.991 --> 01:50:38.750
the volt with a logical analyzer.

01:50:38.750 --> 01:50:40.541
You can measure the voltage,

01:50:40.541 --> 01:50:41.911
without screwing up the circuit,

01:50:41.911 --> 01:50:43.258
at some level.

01:50:43.258 --> 01:50:44.180
- I don't understand what you're saying.

01:50:44.180 --> 01:50:47.020
(laughing)

01:50:47.020 --> 01:50:50.018
- If one day we establish consciousness,

01:50:50.018 --> 01:50:53.711
as the sum of some
energies within the brain,

01:50:53.711 --> 01:50:54.919
then by E=MC squared,

01:50:54.919 --> 01:50:57.048
consciousness has a mass equivalent.

01:50:57.048 --> 01:50:57.881
- That's what I'm saying.

01:50:57.881 --> 01:51:00.178
- [Neil] Yep, okay.

01:51:00.178 --> 01:51:01.506
Thank you.

01:51:01.506 --> 01:51:02.970
Yes sir.

01:51:02.970 --> 01:51:03.868
- [Audience Member] Okay so,

01:51:03.868 --> 01:51:07.490
tonight's discussion was
mostly centered upon,

01:51:07.490 --> 01:51:09.799
human neuroscience for obvious reasons.

01:51:09.799 --> 01:51:12.049
(laughing)

01:51:14.309 --> 01:51:16.439
There was a few mentions about,

01:51:16.439 --> 01:51:17.970
neuroscience and
consciousness and whatnot of,

01:51:17.970 --> 01:51:19.540
other species.

01:51:19.540 --> 01:51:21.420
And we do know that some
species are quite smart.

01:51:21.420 --> 01:51:23.627
And not just like our
close relatives like,

01:51:23.627 --> 01:51:26.710
great apes, but also, toothed whales,

01:51:27.679 --> 01:51:29.599
some birds like parrots and crows,

01:51:29.599 --> 01:51:32.740
and even I recently saw the video,

01:51:32.740 --> 01:51:33.860
that looked like it was unedited,

01:51:33.860 --> 01:51:36.777
of an elephant panting an elephant.

01:51:39.140 --> 01:51:40.151
- Was that on YouTube?

01:51:40.151 --> 01:51:41.989
- [Audience Member] No, it was not.

01:51:41.989 --> 01:51:43.060
(laughing)

01:51:43.060 --> 01:51:44.479
It was not.

01:51:44.479 --> 01:51:46.839
- Was the elephant soapy?

01:51:46.839 --> 01:51:48.450
- I saw a dolphin playing chess,

01:51:48.450 --> 01:51:49.283
is that real?

01:51:49.283 --> 01:51:51.911
(laughing)

01:51:51.911 --> 01:51:54.399
- [Audience Member] Well not
just, my real question is,

01:51:54.399 --> 01:51:56.287
what might consciousness be,

01:51:56.287 --> 01:51:59.095
if it has arisen in different
lineages of living things,

01:51:59.095 --> 01:52:01.735
what might consciousness be for them,

01:52:01.735 --> 01:52:03.727
and also what might it be for say,

01:52:03.727 --> 01:52:05.447
a possible alien life form.

01:52:05.447 --> 01:52:06.468
- We got a Hindu here.

01:52:06.468 --> 01:52:08.718
(laughing)

01:52:12.199 --> 01:52:13.532
- So Heather so,

01:52:15.519 --> 01:52:17.018
conscious,

01:52:17.018 --> 01:52:20.159
big brained mammals out there,

01:52:20.159 --> 01:52:20.997
will we learn,

01:52:20.997 --> 01:52:22.618
can we learn about our consciousness,

01:52:22.618 --> 01:52:23.708
by studying them?

01:52:23.708 --> 01:52:25.236
You work on lab rats to learn about--

01:52:25.236 --> 01:52:26.756
- I don't work on rats, I work on humans,

01:52:26.756 --> 01:52:27.589
but yeah.

01:52:27.589 --> 01:52:28.422
- Oh you work on, excuse me.

01:52:28.422 --> 01:52:29.255
Did you hear how she said that?

01:52:29.255 --> 01:52:30.546
I don't work on rats,

01:52:30.546 --> 01:52:31.546
I work on humans.

01:52:31.546 --> 01:52:32.379
Yeah okay.

01:52:32.379 --> 01:52:34.087
We all feel better about that, yeah, yeah.

01:52:34.087 --> 01:52:34.920
- Well they're different.

01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:35.753
They're different.

01:52:35.753 --> 01:52:36.586
- Different IRB protocol.

01:52:36.586 --> 01:52:37.419
- Yeah exactly.

01:52:37.419 --> 01:52:38.252
Totally different protocol.

01:52:38.252 --> 01:52:39.604
- That is rich.

01:52:39.604 --> 01:52:40.493
The B protocol.

01:52:40.493 --> 01:52:43.162
That is, that's comedy right there.

01:52:43.162 --> 01:52:44.194
- Different protocol yeah.

01:52:44.194 --> 01:52:46.444
(laughing)

01:52:49.996 --> 01:52:52.287
- So what's really, there
are two different things.

01:52:52.287 --> 01:52:53.586
There's intelligence,
there's consciousness.

01:52:53.586 --> 01:52:54.986
A bee can have consciousness.

01:52:54.986 --> 01:52:56.077
It can feel a sensation.

01:52:56.077 --> 01:52:58.175
It can sense something.

01:52:58.175 --> 01:52:59.546
It can do something very simplistic.

01:52:59.546 --> 01:53:01.734
So you don't need to be able
to play chess to be conscious.

01:53:01.734 --> 01:53:03.236
We know that in certain creatures,

01:53:03.236 --> 01:53:05.946
like in dolphins, in whales, in humans,

01:53:05.946 --> 01:53:07.075
there's certain types of cells,

01:53:07.075 --> 01:53:08.466
called spindle cells,

01:53:08.466 --> 01:53:09.935
especially in animals that are social,

01:53:09.935 --> 01:53:12.026
and that that might have
some kind of link up,

01:53:12.026 --> 01:53:15.054
to awareness, or at least some
of kind of self awareness.

01:53:15.054 --> 01:53:17.166
But until we have a fundamental theory,

01:53:17.166 --> 01:53:18.047
of what consciousness is,

01:53:18.047 --> 01:53:19.754
we won't be able to know for sure,

01:53:19.754 --> 01:53:20.664
what something has.

01:53:20.664 --> 01:53:21.535
We only can look at behavior.

01:53:21.535 --> 01:53:22.423
Even with humans,

01:53:22.423 --> 01:53:24.254
in the lab, you have to just ask them,

01:53:24.254 --> 01:53:25.727
did you see that or not,

01:53:25.727 --> 01:53:26.727
or were you aware of that or not.

01:53:26.727 --> 01:53:27.756
That's the only measure we have.

01:53:27.756 --> 01:53:29.956
- I saw a comic of two dolphins,

01:53:29.956 --> 01:53:32.167
one swimming next to another.

01:53:32.167 --> 01:53:35.036
And they're referring to
the humans up on the shore.

01:53:35.036 --> 01:53:37.085
And one says, one dolphin
says to the other,

01:53:37.085 --> 01:53:38.734
if they face each other and make noises,

01:53:38.734 --> 01:53:40.973
but there's no evidence
they're actually communicating.

01:53:40.973 --> 01:53:43.167
(laughing)

01:53:43.167 --> 01:53:44.005
Yes right here.

01:53:44.005 --> 01:53:46.276
- [Audience Member] Yes,
first I have to say,

01:53:46.276 --> 01:53:47.407
what an awesome panel.

01:53:47.407 --> 01:53:48.824
And Bill you did great in the debate.

01:53:48.824 --> 01:53:52.415
(cheering)
(clapping)

01:53:52.415 --> 01:53:53.415
- Thank you!

01:53:56.388 --> 01:53:58.729
- I'm really star struck just being here.

01:53:58.729 --> 01:54:00.169
So but anyways,

01:54:00.169 --> 01:54:02.369
I want to ask two of the neuroscientists,

01:54:02.369 --> 01:54:05.441
and to Neil, 'cause I
think you've been onstage,

01:54:05.441 --> 01:54:07.300
I think a lot of you guys
have been on stage with him.

01:54:07.300 --> 01:54:09.505
It's a rather controversial position,

01:54:09.505 --> 01:54:11.601
held by Sam Harris,

01:54:11.601 --> 01:54:12.434
about whether--

01:54:12.434 --> 01:54:13.729
- [Mayim] He was one of
my colleagues at UCLA.

01:54:13.729 --> 01:54:15.751
(talking at once)

01:54:15.751 --> 01:54:16.584
- Let me preface this by saying,

01:54:16.584 --> 01:54:18.639
I think he's a brilliant order.

01:54:18.639 --> 01:54:20.039
I think he communicates very well.

01:54:20.039 --> 01:54:21.769
I just know he's got some,

01:54:21.769 --> 01:54:22.791
he's a great thinker too.

01:54:22.791 --> 01:54:25.879
But it's trying to parce out whether it's,

01:54:25.879 --> 01:54:26.791
whether we agree or not,

01:54:26.791 --> 01:54:28.239
or whether there's consensus.

01:54:28.239 --> 01:54:29.072
And the question is about,

01:54:29.072 --> 01:54:31.052
whether or not we have free will.

01:54:31.052 --> 01:54:32.732
- Oh yeah I can answer that.

01:54:32.732 --> 01:54:34.111
- Free will.

01:54:34.111 --> 01:54:35.722
- So as far as we know from,

01:54:35.722 --> 01:54:36.831
neuroscience--

01:54:36.831 --> 01:54:39.220
- The point is Sam Harris
recently published,

01:54:39.220 --> 01:54:41.660
a tract on the assertion that,

01:54:41.660 --> 01:54:43.051
we do not have free will.

01:54:43.051 --> 01:54:45.012
And the evidence cited for it,

01:54:45.012 --> 01:54:46.371
comes from neuroscience.

01:54:46.371 --> 01:54:48.162
- I must answer this I have no choice.

01:54:48.162 --> 01:54:50.412
(laughing)

01:54:51.383 --> 01:54:52.962
Sorry you guys go.

01:54:52.962 --> 01:54:55.212
(laughing)

01:54:58.109 --> 01:54:59.132
Or do I.

01:54:59.132 --> 01:55:01.382
(laughing)

01:55:02.828 --> 01:55:04.181
- Free will, what's up?
- So as far as we know,

01:55:04.181 --> 01:55:06.833
it started with Benjamin
Levit studies in the 1980s,

01:55:06.833 --> 01:55:09.432
and then all the way until
modern studies now that,

01:55:09.432 --> 01:55:12.473
the sense of freewill
is kind of an illusion.

01:55:12.473 --> 01:55:14.262
Free will is an illusion
in the sense that,

01:55:14.262 --> 01:55:16.294
your brain decides first,

01:55:16.294 --> 01:55:17.814
and you become aware of it after the fact.

01:55:17.814 --> 01:55:19.293
And we know this from a
whole series of studies,

01:55:19.293 --> 01:55:20.625
from measuring neural observations,

01:55:20.625 --> 01:55:21.458
even studies now where,

01:55:21.458 --> 01:55:23.014
you can put somebody in a scanner,

01:55:23.014 --> 01:55:24.945
and you could predict for example,

01:55:24.945 --> 01:55:26.484
up to 10 seconds now,

01:55:26.484 --> 01:55:27.956
before they're gonna decide whether,

01:55:27.956 --> 01:55:29.164
they're gonna go left or right.

01:55:29.164 --> 01:55:30.276
Or press the left button or right button,

01:55:30.276 --> 01:55:31.596
by just reading their brain activation.

01:55:31.596 --> 01:55:33.203
- [Neil] The brain pre decides.

01:55:33.203 --> 01:55:34.036
- Yeah the brain,

01:55:34.036 --> 01:55:35.522
it's called the readiness potential.

01:55:35.522 --> 01:55:36.762
So it kind of is gearing up.

01:55:36.762 --> 01:55:39.185
And you can start to read
how the neurons are firing,

01:55:39.185 --> 01:55:41.244
and it's gonna go sort of
toward one way or another.

01:55:41.244 --> 01:55:42.077
And at a certain point,

01:55:42.077 --> 01:55:42.910
you can make that prediction,

01:55:42.910 --> 01:55:45.313
well before the person
becomes consciously aware,

01:55:45.313 --> 01:55:47.716
that they've decided to go left or right.

01:55:47.716 --> 01:55:48.585
- Big N too,

01:55:48.585 --> 01:55:49.418
talking big N.

01:55:49.418 --> 01:55:50.523
- Yeah yeah, that's a big N there.

01:55:50.523 --> 01:55:52.134
(laughing)

01:55:52.134 --> 01:55:54.724
It's pretty well established that yes.

01:55:54.724 --> 01:55:56.065
- Okay so but does that alone,

01:55:56.065 --> 01:55:57.482
negate free will.

01:55:58.564 --> 01:56:00.853
Your brain has free will
presumably to do it.

01:56:00.853 --> 01:56:02.453
- The brain decides.

01:56:02.453 --> 01:56:04.961
Your perception of I made the decision,

01:56:04.961 --> 01:56:08.436
only comes after the
brain has already kind of,

01:56:08.436 --> 01:56:09.269
decided.

01:56:09.269 --> 01:56:10.484
- But hold on, I made the decision,

01:56:10.484 --> 01:56:12.494
is my brain that's I'm
making the decisioning.

01:56:12.494 --> 01:56:13.564
- Right.

01:56:13.564 --> 01:56:14.884
- So let me ask you this.

01:56:14.884 --> 01:56:17.534
What is this phenomenon?

01:56:17.534 --> 01:56:21.185
I sure hope I don't see my
keys in the trunk of my car,

01:56:21.185 --> 01:56:22.224
and close the lid on it.

01:56:22.224 --> 01:56:23.625
Was it that?

01:56:23.625 --> 01:56:24.836
You know what I'm talking about?

01:56:24.836 --> 01:56:27.086
(laughing)

01:56:28.874 --> 01:56:32.422
- Why does your brain keep
putting keys in the trunk?

01:56:32.422 --> 01:56:34.413
- You feel that you're
gonna make a mistake,

01:56:34.413 --> 01:56:36.093
but you go ahead and
make the mistake anyways.

01:56:36.093 --> 01:56:37.283
- This is the thing.

01:56:37.283 --> 01:56:38.280
Everybody's talking about consciousness,

01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:39.563
but much of our behavior,

01:56:39.563 --> 01:56:40.396
much of what we're doing,

01:56:40.396 --> 01:56:42.283
is happening outside of awareness.

01:56:42.283 --> 01:56:44.944
So our, you're already halfway there,

01:56:44.944 --> 01:56:45.777
before you're realizing,

01:56:45.777 --> 01:56:47.563
oh where am I going, what am I doing?

01:56:47.563 --> 01:56:49.993
And so if we had to be consciously aware,

01:56:49.993 --> 01:56:51.344
of single move we made,

01:56:51.344 --> 01:56:53.283
the brain doesn't have
the capacity to do that.

01:56:53.283 --> 01:56:55.555
Consciousness has a limited capacity.

01:56:55.555 --> 01:56:56.723
But the unconscious processes,

01:56:56.723 --> 01:56:57.925
seems to be unlimited.

01:56:57.925 --> 01:57:00.193
- Which is not to say we also
couldn't call that free will,

01:57:00.193 --> 01:57:01.483
right, in an unconscious way.

01:57:01.483 --> 01:57:03.273
- You're unconsciously yes,

01:57:03.273 --> 01:57:06.733
you're unconsciously making
decisions freely all the time.

01:57:06.733 --> 01:57:08.104
(laughing)

01:57:08.104 --> 01:57:10.013
- [Neil] Good answer, correct.

01:57:10.013 --> 01:57:12.846
(talking at once)

01:57:14.395 --> 01:57:15.693
We only have time for two more questions.

01:57:15.693 --> 01:57:17.133
I'm sorry for the rest of the line there.

01:57:17.133 --> 01:57:18.144
Sir.

01:57:18.144 --> 01:57:21.731
Wait I see someone really
young in the line there.

01:57:21.731 --> 01:57:22.564
- Aw.

01:57:22.564 --> 01:57:25.997
- Sir, I'm not referring to you.

01:57:25.997 --> 01:57:27.045
- [Audience Member]
Does that mean I'm old?

01:57:27.045 --> 01:57:29.816
- We'll take the last two here,

01:57:29.816 --> 01:57:30.925
and just one more over there.

01:57:30.925 --> 01:57:31.758
Sir go.

01:57:31.758 --> 01:57:33.045
- Okay the question is,

01:57:33.045 --> 01:57:34.976
kind of following up around
the issue of awareness,

01:57:34.976 --> 01:57:36.305
and heightened awareness,

01:57:36.305 --> 01:57:38.196
and the use of psychotropic drugs,

01:57:38.196 --> 01:57:39.685
and hallucinogenics,

01:57:39.685 --> 01:57:42.352
in treatment of brain disorders.

01:57:43.885 --> 01:57:45.507
- [Neil] Oh okay, yeah.

01:57:45.507 --> 01:57:46.957
- [Audience Member] And I
have one other question.

01:57:46.957 --> 01:57:51.147
How many people on the
panel are left handed?

01:57:51.147 --> 01:57:51.980
- Bothsies.

01:57:51.980 --> 01:57:53.547
I'm a little of both.

01:57:53.547 --> 01:57:54.380
- We'll get rid of them.

01:57:54.380 --> 01:57:56.568
(laughing)

01:57:56.568 --> 01:57:57.517
Eugenics.

01:57:57.517 --> 01:57:58.416
Just kidding.

01:57:58.416 --> 01:57:59.676
- No, no.

01:57:59.676 --> 01:58:01.336
Once again,

01:58:01.336 --> 01:58:02.696
left handed people have
certain advantages,

01:58:02.696 --> 01:58:03.547
to certain things right.

01:58:03.547 --> 01:58:04.380
- Yes.

01:58:04.380 --> 01:58:05.826
- It's hilarious old joke.

01:58:05.826 --> 01:58:06.768
You want your kid to grow up,

01:58:06.768 --> 01:58:08.007
to be a left handed relief pitcher,

01:58:08.007 --> 01:58:09.576
because he or she is gonna,

01:58:09.576 --> 01:58:11.528
so far, make more money.

01:58:11.528 --> 01:58:12.616
- Actually people who are left handed,

01:58:12.616 --> 01:58:14.317
have less lateralization.

01:58:14.317 --> 01:58:16.117
So language tends to be more lateral.

01:58:16.117 --> 01:58:17.117
It's not completely in the left brain,

01:58:17.117 --> 01:58:17.950
but there's more--

01:58:17.950 --> 01:58:18.856
- Lateralization.

01:58:18.856 --> 01:58:23.248
- More activation in one
hemisphere of the brain,

01:58:23.248 --> 01:58:24.317
than the other.

01:58:24.317 --> 01:58:25.936
So like language tends to be,

01:58:25.936 --> 01:58:28.837
lateral, or there's more
activation in the left hemisphere.

01:58:28.837 --> 01:58:31.227
But people who are left handed,

01:58:31.227 --> 01:58:32.568
their tends to be more activation,

01:58:32.568 --> 01:58:33.717
in the right hemisphere,

01:58:33.717 --> 01:58:35.368
above and beyond those
who are right handed.

01:58:35.368 --> 01:58:36.814
So there's less lateralization.

01:58:36.814 --> 01:58:38.288
There's more sort of distributed,

01:58:38.288 --> 01:58:39.587
across the brain activation.

01:58:39.587 --> 01:58:41.347
- I'm about 20% left handed.

01:58:41.347 --> 01:58:42.316
- But the point of the--

01:58:42.316 --> 01:58:44.624
(laughing)

01:58:44.624 --> 01:58:47.667
the psychotropic, the
drugs, the treatment,

01:58:47.667 --> 01:58:49.816
there are actually now
studies where I'm at,

01:58:49.816 --> 01:58:50.984
they're using ketamines,

01:58:50.984 --> 01:58:52.984
as a treatment for depression,

01:58:52.984 --> 01:58:55.115
which used to be a club
drug called special K.

01:58:55.115 --> 01:58:56.115
And if you take too much of it,

01:58:56.115 --> 01:58:57.725
you can dissociate.

01:58:57.725 --> 01:58:58.558
- We're doing that later.

01:58:58.558 --> 01:59:00.752
(laughing)

01:59:00.752 --> 01:59:01.585
In the name of science.

01:59:01.585 --> 01:59:03.262
(laughing)

01:59:03.262 --> 01:59:06.272
- Hey man, you guys like
wanna dissociate later.

01:59:06.272 --> 01:59:07.443
(laughing)

01:59:07.443 --> 01:59:09.091
- I've got some special K.

01:59:09.091 --> 01:59:10.141
(laughing)

01:59:10.141 --> 01:59:11.432
- But I think also,

01:59:11.432 --> 01:59:12.281
treatment for depression,

01:59:12.281 --> 01:59:13.592
it's sort of one set,

01:59:13.592 --> 01:59:15.043
but there also is a field,

01:59:15.043 --> 01:59:17.440
that's looking at sort of
understanding altered states,

01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:19.629
of consciousness and our perception,

01:59:19.629 --> 01:59:21.028
of altered states of consciousness.

01:59:21.028 --> 01:59:22.339
Probably beyond the scope of what we're--

01:59:22.339 --> 01:59:25.509
- And even using drugs
like ectasy for therapy,

01:59:25.509 --> 01:59:26.669
and treatment for PTSD.

01:59:26.669 --> 01:59:29.579
- And therapeutically with sort of,

01:59:29.579 --> 01:59:31.029
well trained,

01:59:31.029 --> 01:59:33.612
and very elaborate supervision,

01:59:34.917 --> 01:59:36.387
it can be very helpful.

01:59:36.387 --> 01:59:38.386
(laughing)

01:59:38.386 --> 01:59:40.947
(talking at once)

01:59:40.947 --> 01:59:43.655
(laughing)

01:59:43.655 --> 01:59:46.076
- Just a quick follow up on that.

01:59:46.076 --> 01:59:47.027
Heather,

01:59:47.027 --> 01:59:49.688
is there any mental state,

01:59:49.688 --> 01:59:52.227
beyond the one that is alert and bright,

01:59:52.227 --> 01:59:53.976
that can be chemically induced,

01:59:53.976 --> 01:59:57.936
that is a greater mental
state of awareness,

01:59:57.936 --> 01:59:59.605
than the one you started with,

01:59:59.605 --> 02:00:00.725
because it appears that,

02:00:00.725 --> 02:00:03.397
every time you do anything
chemical to the brain,

02:00:03.397 --> 02:00:05.187
it disrupts your ability,

02:00:05.187 --> 02:00:07.437
to know what reality is.

02:00:07.437 --> 02:00:08.368
- Okay you can go ahead.

02:00:08.368 --> 02:00:09.307
- No, go ahead.

02:00:09.307 --> 02:00:10.140
- Well so.

02:00:10.140 --> 02:00:11.888
(laughing)

02:00:11.888 --> 02:00:12.779
First of all,

02:00:12.779 --> 02:00:14.888
just in our non drug induced state,

02:00:14.888 --> 02:00:16.766
our perception is different
than what's necessarily,

02:00:16.766 --> 02:00:17.826
out there in reality.

02:00:17.826 --> 02:00:19.051
So there's all sorts of illusions.

02:00:19.051 --> 02:00:20.530
You don't see what's right
in front of your face.

02:00:20.530 --> 02:00:21.499
So there's that.

02:00:21.499 --> 02:00:24.371
So anytime you but add a
certain kind of chemical,

02:00:24.371 --> 02:00:26.520
you change the
neurochemistry of the brain,

02:00:26.520 --> 02:00:28.818
it's not gonna say that
you're gonna be more aware.

02:00:28.818 --> 02:00:30.717
You're just gonna have
a different type of,

02:00:30.717 --> 02:00:31.778
awareness and perception.

02:00:31.778 --> 02:00:33.538
- But when you have
things like synesthesia,

02:00:33.538 --> 02:00:36.518
when you have senses crossing from LCD,

02:00:36.518 --> 02:00:38.585
those kinds of experiences,

02:00:38.585 --> 02:00:41.368
these are kind of qualitative
or quantitative questions.

02:00:41.368 --> 02:00:43.867
Yes, you're having more experiences,

02:00:43.867 --> 02:00:45.088
that are much more complicated,

02:00:45.088 --> 02:00:47.539
and much more trippy,

02:00:47.539 --> 02:00:49.248
than what we're experiencing,

02:00:49.248 --> 02:00:51.339
in our normal state.
- Official vocabulary.

02:00:51.339 --> 02:00:53.038
- But I think, well yeah.

02:00:53.038 --> 02:00:53.939
That's subjective also.

02:00:53.939 --> 02:00:55.550
- [Neil] And you've read
about these conditions before.

02:00:55.550 --> 02:00:56.383
- I have.

02:00:56.383 --> 02:00:57.216
(laughing)

02:00:57.216 --> 02:00:58.510
in Life magazine.

02:00:58.510 --> 02:01:00.048
(laughing)

02:01:00.048 --> 02:01:01.509
- So my follow up question is,

02:01:01.509 --> 02:01:04.639
what if the way you see blue
is different than the way,

02:01:04.639 --> 02:01:08.218
that I see blue?
(laughing)

02:01:08.218 --> 02:01:10.390
- It's like really red.

02:01:10.390 --> 02:01:12.099
It's like the same.

02:01:12.099 --> 02:01:13.938
(laughing)

02:01:13.938 --> 02:01:15.608
- Last question on this
side of the audience.

02:01:15.608 --> 02:01:17.196
- Big pressure for the last question.

02:01:17.196 --> 02:01:18.508
Something I've always
been fascinated with.

02:01:18.508 --> 02:01:19.341
You guys talked about,

02:01:19.341 --> 02:01:21.977
telekinesis, mind reading and all that.

02:01:21.977 --> 02:01:23.967
Where does deja vu fall into the spectrum?

02:01:23.967 --> 02:01:26.057
We've all experienced it.

02:01:26.057 --> 02:01:27.636
We've all had that moment or many moments,

02:01:27.636 --> 02:01:29.846
that we know what's coming,

02:01:29.846 --> 02:01:31.665
but we don't know why.

02:01:31.665 --> 02:01:33.144
- Have you asked this before?

02:01:33.144 --> 02:01:35.394
(laughing)

02:01:37.817 --> 02:01:39.845
I waited for one of you, I'm sorry.

02:01:39.845 --> 02:01:41.765
(laughing)

02:01:41.765 --> 02:01:42.598
- It's only because,

02:01:42.598 --> 02:01:43.887
I had already heard you ask that question.

02:01:43.887 --> 02:01:45.937
(laughing)

02:01:45.937 --> 02:01:47.948
It was like ah!

02:01:47.948 --> 02:01:50.239
- Have you heard George
Carlin comment on deja vu.

02:01:50.239 --> 02:01:51.924
He says, "Have you ever
walked into a room,

02:01:51.924 --> 02:01:53.586
"and you were sure,

02:01:53.586 --> 02:01:55.286
"it has never happened to you before?"

02:01:55.286 --> 02:01:56.327
(laughing)

02:01:56.327 --> 02:01:57.188
That's vuja de.

02:01:57.188 --> 02:01:59.039
(laughing)

02:01:59.039 --> 02:02:02.316
So deja vu, what do you
guys say about that?

02:02:02.316 --> 02:02:04.385
- I'm not an expert in this area,

02:02:04.385 --> 02:02:05.876
but I think that there's a sense that,

02:02:05.876 --> 02:02:06.966
something is triggered in the brain,

02:02:06.966 --> 02:02:08.585
where you get a sense of familiarity.

02:02:08.585 --> 02:02:09.527
And then you attribute that,

02:02:09.527 --> 02:02:10.807
to what's happening around you.

02:02:10.807 --> 02:02:13.516
And there's also studies that show,

02:02:13.516 --> 02:02:15.265
when you loose that sense of familiarity,

02:02:15.265 --> 02:02:17.516
some people think that a
person they know very well,

02:02:17.516 --> 02:02:18.447
is an imposter.

02:02:18.447 --> 02:02:19.996
So they think they're husband or wife,

02:02:19.996 --> 02:02:22.756
is an alien, because they
loose the sense of familiarity.

02:02:22.756 --> 02:02:26.465
But and sometimes that same
neuro circuit is activated,

02:02:26.465 --> 02:02:27.636
in any situation.

02:02:27.636 --> 02:02:29.345
And they feel like
they've been there before.

02:02:29.345 --> 02:02:30.703
- And I think that's sort of speaking,

02:02:30.703 --> 02:02:32.775
to the sort of redundancy
that occurs in the brain,

02:02:32.775 --> 02:02:34.276
that the notion is that,

02:02:34.276 --> 02:02:37.195
there are many ways to
get to one destination.

02:02:37.195 --> 02:02:38.876
And sometimes pathways get triggered,

02:02:38.876 --> 02:02:40.687
that have this sort of,

02:02:40.687 --> 02:02:42.087
this sense of familiarity,

02:02:42.087 --> 02:02:43.764
because you've literally activated,

02:02:43.764 --> 02:02:45.335
a pathway that is redundant.

02:02:45.335 --> 02:02:46.556
I mean everything's gotta fit in there.

02:02:46.556 --> 02:02:48.105
Sure there's miles and miles and miles,

02:02:48.105 --> 02:02:49.095
but there are certain things,

02:02:49.095 --> 02:02:50.804
that are going to trigger,

02:02:50.804 --> 02:02:51.916
redundant kind of pathways,

02:02:51.916 --> 02:02:53.945
that also again have that sense of,

02:02:53.945 --> 02:02:54.825
I've done this before.

02:02:54.825 --> 02:02:56.244
And your brain thinks it has.

02:02:56.244 --> 02:02:58.264
- And also the other thing with that,

02:02:58.264 --> 02:02:59.613
memories are malleable.

02:02:59.613 --> 02:03:01.663
Each time you re-remember something,

02:03:01.663 --> 02:03:02.663
you can reconstruct it.

02:03:02.663 --> 02:03:03.833
It's different than the
memory of your iPhone.

02:03:03.833 --> 02:03:04.823
The picture that you look at,

02:03:04.823 --> 02:03:05.656
will stay the same,

02:03:05.656 --> 02:03:06.782
10,000 years from now,

02:03:06.782 --> 02:03:08.132
that picture will be exactly the same.

02:03:08.132 --> 02:03:09.532
But every time you remember something,

02:03:09.532 --> 02:03:10.705
it slightly changes.

02:03:10.705 --> 02:03:13.753
So we can rewrite history in a way.

02:03:13.753 --> 02:03:16.010
- [Neil] The last question of the evening,

02:03:16.010 --> 02:03:17.503
yes.

02:03:17.503 --> 02:03:19.433
- [Child Audience Member] If
someone was born in space,

02:03:19.433 --> 02:03:21.844
how would that affect the way,

02:03:21.844 --> 02:03:23.642
their brain develops?

02:03:23.642 --> 02:03:24.833
- Aw.
- Ooh.

02:03:24.833 --> 02:03:29.727
(clapping)
(cheering)

02:03:29.727 --> 02:03:31.657
- That's great.

02:03:31.657 --> 02:03:32.967
- Well played.

02:03:32.967 --> 02:03:34.967
- [Neil] How old are you?

02:03:34.967 --> 02:03:35.800
- [Child Audience Member] Nine.

02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:37.159
- You're nine.

02:03:37.159 --> 02:03:38.399
It's passed my bedtime.

02:03:38.399 --> 02:03:39.748
Is it past your bedtime?

02:03:39.748 --> 02:03:41.137
(laughing)

02:03:41.137 --> 02:03:41.970
- When you see your parents,

02:03:41.970 --> 02:03:43.036
let em know they're irresponsible.

02:03:43.036 --> 02:03:45.286
(laughing)

02:03:53.996 --> 02:03:55.184
Unless you drove here.

02:03:55.184 --> 02:03:57.745
(laughing)

02:03:57.745 --> 02:03:58.985
Child genius.

02:03:58.985 --> 02:04:01.447
- So first, that's a brilliant question.

02:04:01.447 --> 02:04:02.977
First of all, second,

02:04:02.977 --> 02:04:04.127
I can take it only so far.

02:04:04.127 --> 02:04:07.544
Maybe, Heather and Mayim have some other,

02:04:09.356 --> 02:04:10.647
comments on that.

02:04:10.647 --> 02:04:13.345
But, there are a lot things in our lives,

02:04:13.345 --> 02:04:15.845
that we evolve to be on Earth,

02:04:17.126 --> 02:04:19.719
with our force of gravity,

02:04:19.719 --> 02:04:21.798
and the kind of light that's here.

02:04:21.798 --> 02:04:24.767
And so there're all these things,

02:04:24.767 --> 02:04:28.767
that shape what eventually
we call common sense.

02:04:29.708 --> 02:04:31.541
And, things fall down,

02:04:32.946 --> 02:04:33.907
when you let go of them.

02:04:33.907 --> 02:04:36.057
In fact the act of saying let go,

02:04:36.057 --> 02:04:37.908
means to drop it.

02:04:37.908 --> 02:04:39.449
Where as in space,

02:04:39.449 --> 02:04:40.980
letting go doesn't drop it.

02:04:40.980 --> 02:04:42.489
It just sort of stays there.

02:04:42.489 --> 02:04:45.478
So your awareness of what is normal,

02:04:45.478 --> 02:04:46.836
is really different.

02:04:46.836 --> 02:04:48.179
And we don't really know.

02:04:48.179 --> 02:04:50.308
It's kind of unethical at this point,

02:04:50.308 --> 02:04:51.798
to just do that experiment.

02:04:51.798 --> 02:04:54.716
(laughing)

02:04:54.716 --> 02:04:56.927
See what happens to my kid,

02:04:56.927 --> 02:04:59.177
after she's born in zero G.

02:05:00.867 --> 02:05:02.950
So, we don't really know.

02:05:03.875 --> 02:05:06.207
But from the experiments done,

02:05:06.207 --> 02:05:08.788
there are things about your ears.

02:05:08.788 --> 02:05:09.621
Inside your ear,

02:05:09.621 --> 02:05:11.687
you get a sense of balance.

02:05:11.687 --> 02:05:12.520
Okay.

02:05:14.075 --> 02:05:15.047
Oh sorry.
(laughing)

02:05:15.047 --> 02:05:16.937
I'm just saying.

02:05:16.937 --> 02:05:18.767
At the fitness center, I do
that little balance thing,

02:05:18.767 --> 02:05:19.697
so you can do it.

02:05:19.697 --> 02:05:22.565
So your sense of balance comes about,

02:05:22.565 --> 02:05:23.876
because of your in a gravity field.

02:05:23.876 --> 02:05:25.926
If you, born in space,

02:05:25.926 --> 02:05:27.886
and that's all you know,

02:05:27.886 --> 02:05:30.745
and then we put you here on Earth.

02:05:30.745 --> 02:05:32.794
(laughing)

02:05:32.794 --> 02:05:35.076
Did you see the end of the movie Gravity?

02:05:35.076 --> 02:05:35.909
- No.

02:05:35.909 --> 02:05:36.742
(laughing)

02:05:36.742 --> 02:05:37.575
- In it,

02:05:37.575 --> 02:05:38.408
Sandra Bullock,

02:05:38.408 --> 02:05:40.577
whose been a long time in space--

02:05:40.577 --> 02:05:42.137
- The only accurate part of it.

02:05:42.137 --> 02:05:44.387
(laughing)

02:05:45.225 --> 02:05:47.744
- She crawls up on the beach,

02:05:47.744 --> 02:05:50.487
and she realizes she hasn't had to walk,

02:05:50.487 --> 02:05:51.320
in a long time,

02:05:51.320 --> 02:05:52.715
her sense of balance,

02:05:52.715 --> 02:05:55.367
had grown accustomed to being in zero G.

02:05:55.367 --> 02:05:57.016
And had forgotten,

02:05:57.016 --> 02:05:59.225
what it was like to walk on Earth.

02:05:59.225 --> 02:06:01.975
- Dr. T, I got to interject this.

02:06:03.064 --> 02:06:03.897
- [Neil] Do it.

02:06:03.897 --> 02:06:04.730
- You don't know that.

02:06:04.730 --> 02:06:05.563
- Don't know what.

02:06:05.563 --> 02:06:08.756
- You don't know that if
a kid were born in space,

02:06:08.756 --> 02:06:09.956
that he or she came back to Earth,

02:06:09.956 --> 02:06:11.505
couldn't figure it out.

02:06:11.505 --> 02:06:12.338
You don't know.

02:06:12.338 --> 02:06:15.556
He or she may have actually
a whole different deeper,

02:06:15.556 --> 02:06:20.354
understanding of inertia
and physics and friction.

02:06:20.354 --> 02:06:22.385
I admit, we don't want to run that test.

02:06:22.385 --> 02:06:25.297
(laughing)

02:06:25.297 --> 02:06:26.225
- Uncle Bill is right,

02:06:26.225 --> 02:06:27.058
we don't know.

02:06:27.058 --> 02:06:27.945
Okay.

02:06:27.945 --> 02:06:30.236
(laughing)

02:06:30.236 --> 02:06:32.657
- But our closest guess is Sandra Bullock.

02:06:32.657 --> 02:06:34.806
- Yeah best evidence is what happened,

02:06:34.806 --> 02:06:36.217
at the end of the movie Gravity.

02:06:36.217 --> 02:06:38.436
(laughing)

02:06:38.436 --> 02:06:39.685
Thank you all for coming,

02:06:39.685 --> 02:06:41.102
to StarTalk Live.

02:06:41.996 --> 02:06:44.684
(clapping)
(cheering)

02:06:44.684 --> 02:06:46.267
Thank you, Micheal.
