00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.786
Now what I'd like you to do is factor our expression X minus 4 squared minus 1

00:00:04.786 --> 00:00:09.749
in this way, like we can with all differences of squares. Remembering what A

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:14.429
equaled and what B equaled in the last quiz, write this as A minus B times A

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:14.911
plus B.
