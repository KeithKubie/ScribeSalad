00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.766
We've been using the word set to describe
these different groups of numbers and

00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:11.144
that's exactly what a set is, a collection
of numbers. So, the natural numbers is the

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:19.367
set 1,2,3 and so forth. And the whole
numbers is the set 0, 1, 2, 3 and so

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:27.313
forth. And we might represent the set of
integers like this with ellipses on both

00:00:27.313 --> 00:00:33.278
ends to represent going on to infinity. We
usually denote sets with these curly

00:00:33.278 --> 00:00:38.048
braces around the numbers and commas
between the numbers we give certain sets.

00:00:38.048 --> 00:00:42.355
Like the ones we've talked about special
names. But really a set can be made up of

00:00:42.355 --> 00:00:47.604
any numbers that we put together for
whatever reason. So for example, this set

00:00:47.604 --> 00:01:02.428
-4, 7, 19 is a set. And so is -38, 56,
100.5. As is 9. Now, since all of the

00:01:02.428 --> 00:01:06.834
numbers in the set of natural numbers are
also in the set of whole numbers, we call

00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:12.258
the natural numbers a subset of the whole
numbers. A subset of a set, is another set

00:01:12.258 --> 00:01:18.419
of numbers that are all contained in the
original set. So its a little bit of

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:23.006
practice to make sure you understand what
sets and subsets are. Here's a random set

00:01:23.006 --> 00:01:34.182
of numbers, -4 -3, 0, 0.6, 1, 5, and 8. Which
of the choices below are subsets of the

00:01:34.182 --> 00:01:37.370
set? You may pick more than one answer.
