00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.040
Millie Foster is hoping to start a family soon,

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.320
but her prenatal regimen will be more complicated than most women's because she has a condition called PKU

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:22.800
PKU, phenylketonuria, is a rare inherited disorder where a person lacks a crucial enzyme needed to break down

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.360
an amino acid called phenylalanine

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.520
When PKU is not controlled properly, high levels of phenylalanine, or Phe, are toxic

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.760
to both the brain and body and can lead to serious health complications.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.640
Foster: “I'm very vigilant about that right now.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:47.040
It's given me a really good reason, a good motivation, to on track my Phe levels on a daily basis

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.480
and to watch what I eat and to do whatever it takes to have a healthy baby.”

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.640
Today Millie is a dietitian and spends part of her summer as a counselor here at Emory’s metabolic camp.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.000
The camp was created to help teach girls with PKU how to keep their Phe levels from getting too high.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.760
The girls learn about healthy eating options while avoiding foods high in protein which can spike Phe levels.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.080
Dr. Rani Singh founded and directs the camp.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.560
Singh: "“The earlier we detect, the earlier we diagnose, and the earlier we intervene, the more we protect the brain."

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:32.880
But pregnant women with PKU face special challenges like the threat of having a child with developmental delays even if her baby doesn't have PKU.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.720
“They’ll still be at a very high risk for what we call the maternal PKU syndrome. It's like fetal alcohol syndrome.”

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:50.240
Maternal PKU refers to any number of fetal abnormalities that result from an expecting mother with PKU who has excessive Phe levels in her blood.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:58.480
So even though a woman with PKU may not have symptoms herself, because she's adhered to a restrictive diet throughout her youth,

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.160
her baby could still face devastating consequences if she lapses during pregnancy.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.680
Stanojevich: “I knew going into the pregnancy — because of camp — the risks for a child with a mother that has PKU,

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.640
including microcephaly, which is a small head, which also leads to cognitive development issues,

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.040
and I knew that congenital heart defects is a risk,

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.480
as well as slight risk of craniofacial deformities and growth restriction.”

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.160
Martha Stanojevich is a former camper who as an adult has given birth to one healthy daughter and is expecting her second.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.080
“I think the most important things that I've done it in both pregnancies is tracking my daily intake.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.880
I weigh and measure everything that I eat and then I track it every single day

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.240
and I also count milligrams of Phe, which is the most precise measurement.”

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.440
“It's so important for the mother to be on a strict diet

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.920
and have her Phe levels under control to avoid the toxicity to the developing baby.”

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:02.320
Both Martha and Millie are better able to manage their PKU in part because of the strategies they learned here as teens.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:11.760
“I remember learning at a very young age about the importance of dietary control during pregnancy, nd it was something that was reinforced time and time again as I was here.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:21.040
And so when it became time for my husband and I to plan our first pregnancy, we had good knowledge of what to expect and knew that planning was essential.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.600
I think the camp was completely responsible for that.”
