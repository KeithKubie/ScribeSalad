Do you remember what you had for breakfast? Do you remember the name of your

00:00:03.356 --> 00:00:06.770
first grade teacher? Do you remember the directions to that awesome Indian

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.693
restaurant you ate at last year? Or, do you remember Hebb's Law that we talked

00:00:10.693 --> 00:00:14.568
about in lesson 3? Well, as I'm sure you noticed, all of these have to do with

00:00:14.568 --> 00:00:18.608
memory. That's what we're going to talk about in this lesson. How our brain has

00:00:18.608 --> 00:00:23.104
this amazing capability to remember things. We're going to start this off by

00:00:23.104 --> 00:00:27.241
talking about a famous case study about a man who's just known as H.M. for

00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:30.708
many, many years. Let's go to Susan and Greg to get more details about this

00:00:30.708 --> 00:00:31.420
study.
