00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The next major topic we're going to talk about is digital cash.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
What we want to do is find some way to use numbers to simulate

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
something that would be similar--maybe better, maybe worse--than physical cash.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
What are the properties that physical cash has--at least the properties we might want it to have?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We'll have to have a universal recognized value--

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
that means everyone agrees that it's worth something.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It should be easy to transfer between two individuals--

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that means you can transfer it without having to talk to a bank or some trusted 3rd party.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Some might argue against us including some governments,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
but many individuals would like their cash to be anonymous and untraceable.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Not all government wants this but let's assume that as an individual

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
that we do want our cash to be anonymous and untraceable.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We'd like it to be light and portable--easy to carry. We'd like it to be hard to copy or forge.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
If someone can counterfeit the money,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
well, it probably won't have recognized value for very long.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Assuming that we do want these five properties,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
which of these does US paper currency satisfy well?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I apologize for specifying US, I know many of you are not in the US

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and have different paper currencies.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
You can answer this for your currency. I'm going to answer this for what I think about US paper cash.

00:01:19.000 --> 99:59:59.000
It's definitely a subjective question, but we'll talk about what I think the right answer is.
