00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.199
If you want to change someone’s behavior,
you can do two things.

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:08.040
You can go four layers deep into their dreams
on a daring and deadly raid to plant an idea.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:15.920
Or you can like… flip a switch I guess.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.550
Hi independent thinkers, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.880
You are the master of your mind, right?

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.760
You make your own decisions and nobody and
nothing can make you do anything you don’t

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.760
want to do.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.610
Well I have bad news for you; that might not
be true in the future.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.300
Researchers at the University of Massachusetts
medical school have managed to alter the behavior

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.000
of nematodes by directly reprogramming one
neuron.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.411
The nematode C. elegans is a tiny roundworm
that lives in soil.

00:00:40.411 --> 00:00:44.500
It crawls about, moving its head from side
to side to feel out its environment.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.380
But it has a very clever enemy.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.880
A carnivorous fungus that forms small loops
like nooses.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.930
When the C. elegans pokes its head through,
the noose tightens, breaking the cuticle of

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.989
the worm and letting the fungus feast on the
insides.

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.430
C. elegans has developed a counter to this
deadly noose.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.960
There’s a small delay before the noose tightens,
and if they back away quickly while keeping

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.950
their head straight, they can escape.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.780
For this reason, when the nematode is touched
just behind the head, it will do exactly that.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.380
It won’t back up this way if you touch it
anywhere else, like on the tail or even the

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.380
nose.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.360
With that in mind, Dr. Mark Alkema set out
to see if he could quite literally reprogram

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.770
the worm’s behavior.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.410
C. elegans is the only animal to date that’s
had its entire brain mapped.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.710
It’s only got 302 neurons making 7000 connections,
so it was the ideal candidate for the first

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:30.710
connectome.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.130
A connectome is the name for that fully mapped
neural network.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.080
Because everything is plotted out, the complete
path of this defense against fungus is known,

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.070
from sensory neuron to interneuron to motor
neuron.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.000
So Dr. Alkema decided to see if changing how
one of those neurons fired changed behavior.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.610
His team swapped out a neuron’s inhibitory
channel with an excitatory one.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.030
Now when the engineered C. elegans felt something
behind its head it no longer backed up, but

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.250
pressed on while contracting its head.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.960
It would still fall victim to the noose though,
rendering its survival mechanism moot.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.840
Changing how one little neuron worked completely
changed behavior, while still keeping the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.350
rest of the worm’s brain stable and functioning.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.940
This has implications far beyond keeping fungus
fed.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.750
The idea of a connectome has long been the
subject of debate.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.510
Detractors of it pointed to the nematodes
and said, “Yeah that’s cool and all, but

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.590
can you actually do anything with it?”

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.780
Because of that, mapping neurons of much larger
brains like ours, with our 86 billion neurons

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.780
and 100 trillion synapses, seemed like a fool’s
errand.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.480
It would be costly, time consuming, and ultimately
useless.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.750
Now however it’s been shown that knowing
exactly how behavior flows through the brain

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.390
means we can direct that flow.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.100
If we have a complete map of a human brain,
think of the implications.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.780
Maybe we can write out behavioral disorders
like ADHD, or finally rewire that brain failure

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.380
that makes people play their music out loud
on public transit.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.670
What a wonderful world that would be.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.200
But until that day comes, you’ll just have
to change hearts and minds the old fashion

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.000
way: by getting your thoughts and story out
there.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.520
Which you could do on your very own` website.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.410
And no domain extension will help you tell
your story like a DOT COM or DOT NET domain

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.410
name.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.680
And because you watch DNews, you can get 15%
off Domain Dot Com’s names and web hosting

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.910
by using the code DNews when you check out.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.459
Another challenge to making connectomes is
the brain’s neuroplasticity.

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.120
The brain is a pretty amazing thing and it
adapts and rewires itself.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:34.880
Trace talks about how brains adapt in amazing
ways here.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.540
Connectomes of complex creatures like us would
be tough to pull off, do you think it’d

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.330
be worth it to engineer behavior?

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.670
Is engineering behavior even ethical?

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.849
