[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:08.890
LAURA PARAGANO:
Welcome everybody,

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.375
thanks so much for joining us.

00:00:10.375 --> 00:00:12.291
DUKE ERIKSON: Thanks
everybody for being here.

00:00:12.291 --> 00:00:14.114
STEVE MARKER: Thanks for coming.

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:18.010
LAURA PARAGANO: Big welcome
obviously to Garbage.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.870
Thank you so much
for joining us today

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.460
at Google, to talk about
technology and how it affects

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.450
the creative process.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.240
I'm Laura Paragano.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.459
Please make sure to silence
your cell phones, everybody.

00:00:31.459 --> 00:00:32.956
AUDIENCE: Silence is golden.

00:00:32.956 --> 00:00:34.453
LAURA PARAGANO: Yes.

00:00:34.453 --> 00:00:35.451
DUKE ERIKSON: Ah.

00:00:35.451 --> 00:00:37.424
SHIRLEY MANSON: Beautiful.

00:00:37.424 --> 00:00:39.340
LAURA PARAGANO: Since
their formation in 1993,

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.810
Garbage has sold over 17
million albums worldwide.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.000
And they even recorded
the theme song

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.570
for "The World is Not Enough,"
the 19th James Bond movie.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.400
So thank you so much, Duke,
Steve, Shirley, and Butch

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.110
for joining us.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.400
You are on your 20th anniversary
tour of "Version 2.0."

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.520
2.0, obviously, it's
a technological phrase

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.340
to describe the
evolution of something.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.020
When you were
recording the album,

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.830
how did you feel like this was
a progression of yourselves

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.430
as a band?

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.540
BUTCH VIG: I think
what we learned

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.840
in our debut record was that we
kind of came up with a sound.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.960
And one conscious
decision that we

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.150
made when we started
our second album was we

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.180
did not want to
reinvent ourselves.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.900
We wanted to take everything
we learned and raise the bar.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.890
And so it's sort
of tongue in cheek.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.914
That's why it's
called, "Version 2.0."

00:01:34.914 --> 00:01:36.580
But that's also the
first record that we

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.930
dove into the digital world.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.459
We started working
with Pro Tools.

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:40.750
And haven't really looked back.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.312
I mean, that
clearly was becoming

00:01:42.312 --> 00:01:43.270
the wave of the future.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.145
So that's kind of why we
call it "Version 2.0."

00:01:46.145 --> 00:01:47.520
Not even so much
tongue in cheek.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.930
We just felt like it was a
new, bigger, faster, better,

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.730
stronger, updated
version of Garbage.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.990
LAURA PARAGANO: Did
that affect the process

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.530
of writing the album or just
the production side of things?

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.460
DUKE ERIKSON: I think
it affected everything.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.790
The technology,
they work together,

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.289
the technology and the creative
sides, kind of fed one another.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.479
And I think calling
it "Version 2.0,

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.160
we were hoping it was also
an upgrade in the songwriting

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.470
and the music itself, it wasn't
just about the technology.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.870
LAURA PARAGANO:
Yeah, in the process

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.340
of now playing it
20 years later,

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.420
you've had to adjust
to perform it live.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.300
And it's a trend
nowadays, it seems

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.780
like, artists playing
seminal albums in full.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.300
Has the process of
playing it changed

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.095
since the time of recording it?

00:02:41.095 --> 00:02:42.220
SHIRLEY MANSON: Not really.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.950
[LAUGHS] I mean, the weird
thing is, 20 years ago, we

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.800
were pretty forward thinking.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.879
And a lot of the
software developers and

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.420
so on and so forth
were very enamored

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.330
with Butch's production
career and really directed

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.290
a lot of their
prototypes towards him

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.890
and our engineer at the time.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.540
And so we were forward thinking.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.230
And we brought it
to the live setting,

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.490
we encountered a
lot of hostility,

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.230
I think is the best
way of putting it.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.530
Because we did incorporate the
technology into our live show.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.362
And this was seen back
then as a sort of sin.

00:03:26.362 --> 00:03:28.570
You know, you're not real
musicians, you're cheaters,

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:29.320
you're fakers.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.450
I mean, it sounds
hysterical now,

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.020
but 20 years ago
it felt very real.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.696
And we were a little
daunted by the hostility

00:03:39.696 --> 00:03:40.820
that we met from reviewers.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.060
Now, of course, 20
years on, everybody's

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.670
doing basically what we
were doing back then.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.035
LAURA PARAGANO: Drum pads--

00:03:47.035 --> 00:03:47.910
SHIRLEY MANSON: Yeah.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.409
BUTCH VIG: And loops
and sequencers.

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:52.090
And we actually got
a threat from someone

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.100
in Australia, who said
if you come to Australia

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.641
and play with this
technology, you're

00:03:55.641 --> 00:03:57.160
going to get booed off stage.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.292
And we were like really?

00:03:58.292 --> 00:04:00.010
Because they really
wanted [INAUDIBLE]..

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.933
Anyway, we went to Australia
a lot, and they loved us.

00:04:02.933 --> 00:04:03.880
So--

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.509
LAURA PARAGANO: Shows them.

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:08.050
SHIRLEY MANSON: But our process
has basically stayed the same

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.670
for the last 20 years.

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.810
And we've seen our approach
be incorporated basically

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.620
by mainstream artists,
and everybody's

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.130
doing it, kind of, now.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.360
But back then, we were
definitely one of the first

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.990
to cheat.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.252
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:25.252 --> 00:04:28.750
BUTCH VIG: The good thing
is, it was daunting.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.480
Our engineer, Billy Bush--

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.530
we had to scratch our
heads to try and figure out

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.230
how do we take the studio sound,
which was quite complicated

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.960
on the first record,
and take it to a stage.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.590
And I don't know if all
of you remember ADATs.

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.350
We put some backing
tracks in ADATs.

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.730
We had weird click tracks
that I would listen to,

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.280
and cue with the band.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.820
You guys had these
guitar pedals.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.130
It was a mismatch of stuff.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.396
We had inner ears, plus
also wedges on stage.

00:04:53.396 --> 00:04:54.520
STEVE MARKER: Midi guitars.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.110
BUTCH VIG: Midi
guitars, which were

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:02.691
really slow to play and
actually to do a patch changing.

00:05:02.691 --> 00:05:04.970
But every tour, we got better.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.600
And it's to the point now where
the technology is incredible.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.044
And I run a Ableton
launch pad behind me.

00:05:11.044 --> 00:05:13.460
And when we start a song, after
Shirley cues it, I hit it,

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.959
and it sets everything
on the stage,

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:17.112
sets the guitars, the
keyboards, the bass,

00:05:17.112 --> 00:05:18.070
everything in my drums.

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.650
I'm playing a full electronic
drum kit now, a Roland TD-50.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.080
And it sounds incredible.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.260
And it was a lot
harder 20 years ago

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.530
to kind of pull a sound off.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.780
But now I think we probably
sound closer to our albums

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:30.647
than we ever have.

00:05:30.647 --> 00:05:32.230
LAURA PARAGANO:
Because of the quality

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.305
of the digital instruments?

00:05:34.305 --> 00:05:37.150
BUTCH VIG: And because we're
just way better musicians now.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.892
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:37.892 --> 00:05:39.850
DUKE ERIKSON: That's
right, I like that answer.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.470
BUTCH VIG: After 20
years of practice,

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.514
we're finally learning how
to play some of the songs.

00:05:45.514 --> 00:05:47.680
LAURA PARAGANO: Yeah, I was
talking to Duke earlier,

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.920
and he said that you actually
don't play with amps on stage

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:51.762
at all, it's fully--

00:05:51.762 --> 00:05:52.000
STEVE MARKER: No amps.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.750
LAURA PARAGANO: --plugged
into the system.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.960
SHIRLEY MANSON: We have
a completely clean stage,

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.970
which again, we sort
of attempted back then,

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:59.370
and people were horrified.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.420
Like where are your amps?

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.480
But we thought it was
thrilling to utilize

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.800
the technology that way.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.160
And so even on this tour,
in homage to 20 years ago,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.710
we have a completely bare stage.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.800
There's no equipment that
you can see at all, aside

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.390
from old-school analog
keyboards, and a mic stand,

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:20.172
and a drum kit.

00:06:20.172 --> 00:06:22.000
STEVE MARKER: And no sound,
other than your voice.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.937
SHIRLEY MANSON: Yeah.

00:06:22.937 --> 00:06:24.840
STEVE MARKER: Which really
helps the front of the house.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.381
DUKE ERIKSON: And
tap, tap, tap, tap.

00:06:26.381 --> 00:06:27.790
STEVE MARKER: A little tapping.

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.630
SHIRLEY MANSON: The greatest
sort of development in my life

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.540
currently has been
his electronic kit.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:40.060
Because as a singer, the
old-school drum kits just

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.660
bleed into your mic and
it creates havoc on stage.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.940
And so now, God bless
him, he has a silent kit.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.950
So all the bleed
that traditionally

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:56.470
would come through my mic
and cloud the sound is gone.

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.970
So we can get really
clear signals up front,

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.040
and it makes it so much easier
for our front of house to mix.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.424
And also, it's just joyous
to have a quiet drummer.

00:07:06.424 --> 00:07:07.252
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.310
LAURA PARAGANO: Never happens.

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.970
That preempts my
next question, which

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.680
I was going to say if you could
bring any piece of technology

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.500
now back in time to
when you were recording,

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.260
what would it be?

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.280
It sounds like maybe
that's a huge sell for you,

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.032
to be able to have
that clarity of sound.

00:07:23.032 --> 00:07:23.740
I don't know if--

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:24.850
SHIRLEY MANSON: That
would be amazing.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:27.099
LAURA PARAGANO: --anybody
else has a different answer.

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:31.300
BUTCH VIG: The great
thing about technology

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.209
is it gets better and
usually cheaper every year.

00:07:34.209 --> 00:07:36.500
It's not something where the
price, the better it gets,

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.930
the more expensive it gets.

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:42.410
So it's just made our
whole world much easier.

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:44.470
And I wish, quite frankly,
when we started out

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.050
with the technology,
we'd be where it is now.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:47.480
It would've been so much easier.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:51.190
There was a lot of head
scratching, and agony,

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:53.229
and just freaking
out, trying to figure

00:07:53.229 --> 00:07:54.520
how to do it on the first tour.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.880
But somehow, we made it through.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.690
LAURA PARAGANO: What
was like the hardest

00:07:58.690 --> 00:07:59.910
thing on the first tour?

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:04.450
Or which aspect of the
technological nuances?

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:07.970
BUTCH VIG: For me, we put like--

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:09.550
so if you understand,
there's a lot

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:11.040
of loops and things
in the Garbage songs.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.789
So we would take the
loops off the record,

00:08:12.789 --> 00:08:14.600
I would play live
drums over them.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.970
But to get the--

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:18.490
to be able to play
those back, we

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:22.160
had to put the loops from
the record on a ADAT,

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.340
and Shirley would write
up the set every night,

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:27.270
but back then, you had to
hit fast forward and rewind.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:30.220
So depending on where the set
was, oh, my god, the first song

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.729
is the first song, and then
the 20th song on the ADAT

00:08:32.729 --> 00:08:33.520
is the second song.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.853
So I'd go, OK, talk, Shirley,
talk, I'm fast forwarding,

00:08:35.853 --> 00:08:36.789
talk.

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:38.619
And it only took
sometimes 15 seconds

00:08:38.619 --> 00:08:40.900
to go with that, or
20 seconds, but that

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.280
can seem like an
eternity on the stage

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.470
if Shirley's not talking
while I'm standing there.

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:49.540
So that used to be my biggest
freak out every night,

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.869
like let's trying to get a
set list that I'm not fast

00:08:51.869 --> 00:08:53.660
forwarding and rewinding
between the songs.

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.630
SHIRLEY MANSON: Yeah, so we
weren't able to really change

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:56.520
things up as much.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.630
Now we are as free, as a
result of the technology,

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:07.410
as just a normal
hard-working musician.

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.770
It's so adaptable
now and so quick

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:12.830
that we can do
things on the fly,

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:15.850
and we never were able
to do that 20 years ago.

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:19.210
DUKE ERIKSON: We did
two songs on a talk show

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:22.410
in Paris, and the
little ADAT thing--

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.759
SHIRLEY MANSON: Oh, god, yeah.

00:09:24.759 --> 00:09:26.550
DUKE ERIKSON: The ADAT
thing wouldn't work,

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.700
and Butch is back there
going-- like that.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:29.295
SHIRLEY MANSON: On live TV.

00:09:29.295 --> 00:09:30.378
STEVE MARKER: National TV.

00:09:30.378 --> 00:09:31.730
DUKE ERIKSON: Live to the air.

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:32.896
BUTCH VIG: It had shut down.

00:09:32.896 --> 00:09:35.530
It had gone to sleep
while we went off stage.

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:38.170
And it was all cued up but
the power was off on it.

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.720
And I hit go, and it's warming
up, warming up-- oh, fuck,

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.886
we're just standing there,
everyone's staring at me.

00:09:42.886 --> 00:09:46.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:50.100
We've learned to play the
songs with our bass player--

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.090
Eric, from Jane's
Addiction plays with us.

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:53.140
He's incredible.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.070
I can play drums.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:56.330
These guys can play guitars.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.330
If the loops don't
work, we can still play.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.290
But it sounds more
like the record

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:04.120
if we have the percussion loops
or the crazy sound effects

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:04.720
and stuff.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.520
So we do like to rely on it.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.040
When it doesn't work,
we just go old school

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.810
and play two guitars,
bass drums and vocal.

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:14.260
We're more sort of
unplugged at that point,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.536
but we can still do it.

00:10:15.536 --> 00:10:16.660
LAURA PARAGANO: Absolutely.

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.340
In general, as
like a philosophy,

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:21.550
do you try to stay as close to
the album sound as possible,

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:25.290
or have you explored
evolving in any way,

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:30.490
or changing in any way that
sound to a live experience?

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:33.750
SHIRLEY MANSON: Not really,
because the layering of sounds

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.790
and the utilizing of all the
different samples and loops

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:40.480
and so on, became the
signature sound of our band.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.300
And again, going
back 20 years, we

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.370
met with a lot of hostility
because of the way

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:47.300
that we put records together.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.410
But as a result, we
developed a sound of ours

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:54.310
that's really unique to us.

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:58.540
So we do try and make sure we
have these layers, upon layers,

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:00.520
upon layers all the time.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.960
Because that's what
makes us sound like us.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:06.520
And we're proud of that.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.790
To have your own unique
sound in a landscape

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:12.700
where you literally have
millions and millions of bands

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:16.900
at this point, is really
rare and obviously

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.849
of great value to us.

00:11:18.849 --> 00:11:21.140
LAURA PARAGANO: Yeah, given
that you are so layer heavy

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.680
and now it's even easier
to make those layers,

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.690
has that changed
your songwriting

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:27.700
process for the better?

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:28.900
Has it made it smoother?

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.570
Has it almost made it
harder, because there's

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:34.020
so many loops that you
can make and sounds

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.400
that you can work with?

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:40.870
BUTCH VIG: We kind of lost
our minds on "Version 2.0."

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:42.760
We had done the first
record on 48 track.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.300
In fact, some of the songs
on our debut album we're just

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.880
on 24 track analog tape.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.070
And when we got Pro
Tools, we realized,

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:53.520
you can record as many
tracks as you want.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.090
And there were
three or four songs,

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:58.300
like "Hammering in my
Head," and "Push It,"

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.660
maybe a couple more that
had over 200 tracks,

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:04.150
like had 225 or 230 tracks.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.030
Clearly, we did not
know how to self edit

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:10.355
at the time, which became
a problem in mixing,

00:12:10.355 --> 00:12:11.980
because as we were
trying to figure out

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:13.600
what we should
leave in the song,

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.650
we had a lot of
decision making to do.

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:17.890
I think we've gotten better
at that now, quicker.

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:21.070
We just, rather than have
25 options for the guitar

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:22.920
solo or whatever,
we pretty much get

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.790
one sound and we stick with it.

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:25.995
DUKE ERIKSON: One take.

00:12:25.995 --> 00:12:26.526
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:26.526 --> 00:12:27.695
STEVE MARKER: Yeah right.

00:12:27.695 --> 00:12:28.565
LAURA PARAGANO:
Your professionals.

00:12:28.565 --> 00:12:29.465
STEVE MARKER: Yeah.

00:12:29.465 --> 00:12:31.450
BUTCH VIG: But the
technology is--

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:32.890
the great thing
about that too is

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:34.690
that the way we
work as a band is,

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:37.150
we usually come in
with a song idea,

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.650
and it could come from someone
that has a chord progression.

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:41.380
It could be from a title.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.180
Shirley might just
have a title, or Steve

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.220
might have a guitar
riff, or whatever.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.840
We jam and come up
with a little fragment.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.320
And then typically, how we
work is it's like a canvas.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.360
We throw a lot of things at it.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.340
We keep adding sounds
and taking things away.

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.387
And the song can sound
one way at the start,

00:12:56.387 --> 00:12:58.720
and by the end of it, it's
radically different sounding.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.199
And sometimes we change
the tempo and keys.

00:13:01.199 --> 00:13:03.490
Usually, it isn't until she
Shirley finishes her lyrics

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:05.680
that that sort of
dictates to us more how it

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.570
should sound arrangement wise.

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:10.050
But the songs take a journey.

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:14.689
And we couldn't do it
without the technology.

00:13:14.689 --> 00:13:17.230
You know, if we were trying to
work that way with analog tape

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:19.313
back in the day, we just
couldn't make the records

00:13:19.313 --> 00:13:20.070
that we make now.

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:21.790
LAURA PARAGANO: It would
take like two minutes just

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:23.600
to rewind and listen
to it again, I'm sure.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.710
DUKE ERIKSON:
That's right, yeah.

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:29.960
LAURA PARAGANO: So how
do you know when to stop?

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.670
I mean, obviously,
the lyrics help,

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:35.500
but I think when you're
working with layers,

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:39.160
or you can have the
vocals and still

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.914
have it go towards
a different mood.

00:13:40.914 --> 00:13:43.330
Are there some songs that have
kind of just like flown out

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:48.030
and some that take a
lot more processing?

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:50.280
SHIRLEY MANSON: It's usually
when I say that's enough.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.071
STEVE MARKER: Yeah.

00:13:51.071 --> 00:13:52.050
BUTCH VIG: Yeah.

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:53.155
SHIRLEY MANSON:
That's enough of that.

00:13:53.155 --> 00:13:54.000
STEVE MARKER:
You've had your fun.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.360
SHIRLEY MANSON: Yeah.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:58.400
To be honest, I mean, it usually
is that just, sort of like,

00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.950
OK, we need to chill now.

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:02.140
Like, this is good,
let's put it out,

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:04.316
let's move forward
with our lives.

00:14:04.316 --> 00:14:05.190
I mean, is that fair?

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:06.148
BUTCH VIG: That's true.

00:14:06.148 --> 00:14:07.720
Left to our devices,
Duke, and Steve,

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:10.312
and I would probably just
keep twiddling away--

00:14:10.312 --> 00:14:11.770
I've got another
idea for the verse

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:14.710
here, or whatever, because we
are kind of a nerdy lab rats.

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:16.310
I mean, that's
what we like to do.

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:18.960
But Shirley just puts her foot
down, and then the song's done.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.690
LAURA PARAGANO: Amazing.

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:26.590
We were talking about
how you, as a band,

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:30.430
were one of the first to come
into this digital space that

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:34.420
includes not just production
and the creative process,

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:36.484
but also engaging
with audiences.

00:14:36.484 --> 00:14:37.900
Shirley, you were
one of the first

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:41.710
to have a blog where
you're talking to fans.

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:46.240
How has that impacted the
experience of connection

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.615
with those individuals?

00:14:47.615 --> 00:14:49.240
SHIRLEY MANSON: That's
a good question.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:53.590
I mean, I think I was
actually the first to be

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:58.190
directly communicating
with an audience online.

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.700
And I'm not entirely
sure what drove

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.460
me to do that, other
than somebody had said,

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.832
you know, you can
keep a diary of what's

00:15:06.832 --> 00:15:08.290
going on in the
studio if you want,

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:09.850
and then we'll post
it to the fans.

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:11.800
It was somebody at
the record label.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.450
And I was like, yeah, OK.

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:15.760
And because I was isolated.

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.750
I was living in
Madison, Wisconsin.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:18.580
I couldn't drive.

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.460
I I still didn't
really have any money.

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:23.200
I don't have a credit card.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.390
I was so isolated.

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.940
And so the ability
to communicate

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:31.800
with an outside life was
extraordinary for me.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.490
And Steve did some of it too.

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:40.170
And the impact has
been sort of profound

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:45.330
and has grown exponentially
over the last 20 years for us.

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:52.030
And we have a pretty tight
relationship with our fans

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:55.360
through social
media as a result.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.910
And we've never abused it.

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:03.490
And we've never allowed
it to get too intrusive.

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:06.700
But it has been a
remarkable tool for us,

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:11.040
particularly in the
first two records.

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.790
There was a lot of
inaccuracies written up

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:13.729
about us in the press.

00:16:13.729 --> 00:16:15.520
Then all of the sudden,
we had this ability

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:19.120
to counteract what
was fake news.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.660
We could counteract
it with our own voice.

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:25.690
And as a result, you
can sort of relax,

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:27.520
because you know that
you have an ability

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.230
to communicate with
you're following,

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:31.930
which is, quite frankly, the
only people we care about.

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:34.770
We don't really care about
people who don't know us,

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:38.260
don't like us, who
gives a shit, you know.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.890
But with the fans, it matters
what they think to us,

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:43.960
and what they hear, and
what they read about.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:47.050
And so social media
has given us an ability

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:52.930
to directly respond to them
and put falsities right.

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:58.020
And that is an incredible
tool for a musician.

00:16:58.020 --> 00:16:59.920
LAURA PARAGANO: Yeah,
they're very much one

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.630
to many platforms,
so I could see

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:06.010
that being a great opportunity
to be your authentic self

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:06.969
to a lot of people.

00:17:06.969 --> 00:17:09.010
Have you ever experienced
the other side of that,

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:11.530
where you get feedback
through those blogs,

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:13.690
or you hear something
from fans and it's

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:16.950
affected the way you've
tried to create music?

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:20.050
SHIRLEY MANSON: Not so
much tried to create music.

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:22.960
I mean, I'm lucky,
I'm like a bulldog.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:26.349
You can say stuff to me
and it'll piss me off,

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:28.430
but it won't
necessarily shake me.

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:30.070
I'm hard to shake.

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:33.220
So I don't allow outside
opinions necessarily

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:34.995
to change the way that
we approach music.

00:17:34.995 --> 00:17:36.370
I think that'd be
very dangerous.

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:38.590
We're not here to
pleasure other people.

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:39.970
We're here to
pleasure ourselves.

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:44.350
This is a selfish endeavor
amongst the four of us.

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:45.910
And if you like it, you like it.

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:48.400
If you don't connect
with it, that's fine.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.430
But yeah, I don't listen
to that kind of input.

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:55.330
At the same time, I have
been taught enormous lessons

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:59.894
by fans over the years,
in all aspects of my life.

00:17:59.894 --> 00:18:01.810
And they've put me right
about a lot of stuff.

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:05.780
They have educated me for stuff
I'm incredibly grateful for.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.140
And they have turned me
on to music I would never,

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.740
ever of heard of.

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:13.889
So that's magic, you
know, it's really magical.

00:18:13.889 --> 00:18:15.430
LAURA PARAGANO: What
advice would you

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:18.340
give to musicians who
are able to utilize some

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:21.790
of those free tools or
now have the opportunity

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:26.002
to make quality music much
easier than you had originally?

00:18:26.002 --> 00:18:27.460
BUTCH VIG: Well,
I think you really

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:30.550
have to try and find your own
voice As Shirley mentioned

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:33.280
earlier, there's millions
and millions of bands

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.750
now on YouTube.

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:39.479
And quite frankly, we're kind
of awash in a sea of mediocrity.

00:18:39.479 --> 00:18:41.270
I mean, there's a lot
of interesting music.

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:45.175
But in order to really have
your music heard as an artist,

00:18:45.175 --> 00:18:46.300
you have to be really good.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.626
It has to rise above
the rest somehow.

00:18:48.626 --> 00:18:50.250
And I think the only
way you can really

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:51.770
do that is you have
to be authentic.

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:55.680
You can't seem fake or try to
chase some trend because you

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.120
think it'll be popular.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:00.240
I think people know now when
they latch on to a new artist,

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.740
they can tell if
they're authentic

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.790
and if they're saying
something that is real.

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:06.120
So that's the one thing
I try to tell people,

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.580
that you have to try and
find that authenticity

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:09.951
and follow that.

00:19:09.951 --> 00:19:12.450
Because you're also going to
be much happier if you do that.

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:15.409
If you try to become something
else just to become famous,

00:19:15.409 --> 00:19:16.950
and you don't like
what you're doing,

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:18.600
you're going to be miserable.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:22.344
So try to follow
your true heart.

00:19:22.344 --> 00:19:24.760
LAURA PARAGANO: Do you feel
like it's a double-edged sword

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:31.510
of making authentic music that
maybe is not as sellable or not

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:33.880
easily--

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:38.620
get into a broader audience that
could then hear, and therefore

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:41.177
allow for creation
of more music?

00:19:41.177 --> 00:19:42.760
SHIRLEY MANSON: Well,
it takes courage

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:47.190
to be different from
the rest of the crowd.

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:50.250
Because we are living
currently in a society

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:52.200
that wants immediate results.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:57.810
So for a young artist to
emerge, to practice patience,

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:01.450
and to pursue their
own way forward

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:03.340
is becoming rarer,
and rarer, and rarer.

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:05.440
Because people understand
they have a nanosecond

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.760
to make an impact.

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.140
And once they've
made the impact,

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:09.980
they have to then
build on that impact.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:14.080
And the pressure on young
artists is astounding.

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:18.030
And you see them all come
and go, I mean they're here

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:18.790
and they're huge.

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:21.040
Like what Butch says, they'll
have a million followers

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:24.100
for like five minutes, and then
you never hear of them again.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:27.720
And we've been really lucky
to have enjoyed a long career.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:30.070
And we understand
what that takes.

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:34.600
And what that takes is just
an ability to sit in failure.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:37.630
Failure is part of the role--

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:41.890
I'm sure for you as
designers and creators,

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:43.540
you understand what
I mean by that.

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:46.780
It's difficult not to be
successful all the time

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:50.170
and not to be igniting
people's excitement.

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:52.420
But at the same time,
I'm a great believer,

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:55.224
we all are, in the band,
of you do the work,

00:20:55.224 --> 00:20:57.140
and you do the work
because you care about it,

00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:59.700
and because you
are invested in it,

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.020
and you have your own style.

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.660
And sooner or later,
it's like putting pennies

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:08.560
in a piggy bank, you know, you
start to accrue a currency,

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:09.950
an agency.

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:13.100
But that takes, that's painful.

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:16.610
[LAUGHS] And
unfortunately, young people

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:20.090
can't always sustain
that kind of hit.

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:22.850
So yes, it's absolutely
a double-edged sword.

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:26.340
You can get seen immediately.

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.510
But then do you have what it
takes to get to the next level

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:32.967
and maintain attention.

00:21:32.967 --> 00:21:34.550
LAURA PARAGANO: What
would your advice

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:37.340
be for someone who hits
that level of failure,

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:41.600
to push through and continue
making something authentic?

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.010
BUTCH VIG: Write a hit single.

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:43.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:45.110
STEVE MARKER:
That's a good idea.

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:46.735
SHIRLEY MANSON: Don't
we all wish that.

00:21:46.735 --> 00:21:49.130
BUTCH VIG: Yeah, that
always seems to work.

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:51.713
LAURA PARAGANO: Do you feel like
technology has made it easier

00:21:51.713 --> 00:21:52.940
to fail faster?

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:54.590
Because we often
say here fail fast,

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:59.610
fail often, as a way to
overcome that fear of failure.

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:01.670
I'm not sure if that's
something where,

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:04.940
by being able to make
music faster, in some ways,

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:07.640
or sketch out ideas, you
can see that it's not

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.390
going to lead down a particular
path that feels true or right

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:14.482
to the intention of the song.

00:22:14.482 --> 00:22:17.430
BUTCH VIG: Well, everything
is being consumed so fast now.

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:20.360
I mean, the whole generation
of kids, like my daughter's 12,

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.860
and just to see what
her classmates, how

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:26.100
they absorb music, and
their attention span

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:28.320
is so brief these days.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.360
I think I read
something last year

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.310
that the average
length of a song played

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:33.682
is about 45 seconds now.

00:22:33.682 --> 00:22:35.640
As soon as it gets the
chorus, they just, boom,

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:37.490
go to the next song.

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:39.574
Which is, to me, is
just really depressing.

00:22:39.574 --> 00:22:41.490
Because they never allow
themselves to sort of

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:43.890
engage in that full experience
of what it was like when

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:45.460
that person wrote that song.

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:46.927
We're a firm believer in--

00:22:46.927 --> 00:22:48.510
I mean, we're old
school, but we still

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:50.166
like to make albums,
where you sit down

00:22:50.166 --> 00:22:52.290
and listen to a piece of
music all the way through.

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:52.800
But we're--

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:54.240
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.182
Obviously, we're not of the
new millennial generation.

00:22:57.182 --> 00:22:59.140
So there's a whole
different mindset out there.

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:02.880
And I think it's, like what
Shirley was saying, it's tough.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.160
You have to have
some patience and be

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:08.850
willing to just persevere
through whatever it takes,

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:11.970
whether it's writing,
or the ups and downs,

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:17.160
and try to not worry about
if you think your music is

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.690
disappearing quick.

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:21.190
You just have to keep at it,
you just have to keep writing.

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:25.230
You probably have to keep
writing faster than we do.

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:27.060
We're not the
speediest band when

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:28.230
it comes to making an album.

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:31.560
But I know a lot of
talented musicians now,

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:33.420
they can crank out
a song and sometimes

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:35.710
really good, in
like 24, 48 hours.

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:36.960
And the production is amazing.

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:37.918
And the songs are good.

00:23:37.918 --> 00:23:41.600
And to me, that's
incredibly cool.

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.370
LAURA PARAGANO: Awesome, yeah.

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:47.960
You were saying that people only
listen to the first 45 seconds,

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.640
and obviously, you
can make a great song

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:53.456
and have it be complex enough
that perhaps someone will

00:23:53.456 --> 00:23:54.080
listen through.

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:57.230
But it seems like
now 65% of sales

00:23:57.230 --> 00:24:03.110
come from streaming services,
where that album concept kind

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:05.570
of gets dissipated, and
it's so easy for someone

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:07.670
to listen to a single song.

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:11.030
Do you, as a band,
feel that pressure

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:13.700
to focus at all on singles?

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:16.610
Or it sounds like you still
very much care about the album,

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:20.130
but is in the back
of your mind ever?

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:23.870
SHIRLEY MANSON: Be the
change you want to see.

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:26.600
You can fall in with the
crowd and be swept along

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.180
with the tides of
the day, but I think

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:32.690
there's a lot to be said
for, we believe in this,

00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:34.130
this is what we'll stand behind.

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:36.200
And again, like I
said, it takes courage.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:39.980
And it takes-- there's a
lot of failure as a result,

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:43.040
because you're not
falling in with the tide.

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:47.870
But over a course of time, that
can actually be in your favor.

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:50.420
We've been playing
now for 25 years.

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:53.230
We've got an incredible
discography as a result.

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:57.170
And we can play around with
that and create great shows that

00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:59.510
are different every
time, because we

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:04.250
have a breadth of material that
singles-orientated bands don't

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:04.910
have.

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:07.700
To go out and play
a show of just hit

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:11.330
singles doesn't really--

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:14.180
generally speaking, it's
just not that interesting.

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.400
And then you see an
artist like Nick Cave,

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.710
who has never had a hit
single in his entire career--

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:22.970
arguably, in the
UK, with "Kylie".

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:24.770
But generally
speaking, as an artist,

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:27.440
he's just done his own thing,
and he's done it slowly

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.550
and incrementally.

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:30.920
And now, we're seeing
him fill stadiums.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:34.040
And yet, he is like as
alternative and sort

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:38.530
of cross like anti-pop.

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:42.290
And yet he's got the career
that pop stars dream of.

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:43.930
And that's what I believe in.

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:46.400
And that's what I
want to invest in.

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:49.310
I don't really care
about being fashionable

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:51.680
or the sound of the moment.

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:53.600
It's like we wear
that for a moment,

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.010
and then inevitably,
that passes,

00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:59.060
you're no longer the zeitgeist,
so where do you go then?

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:02.230
What do you do with your
creative energy after that?

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:05.290
And that's, to me, exciting.

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:07.790
LAURA PARAGANO: Do you feel
like you still have the pressure

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:09.500
to play those hit singles?

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:15.320
Or because you don't necessarily
care about the zeitgeist,

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:19.880
that you're able to say, I'm
going to play a single album,

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.076
and that'll be the
entire concert?

00:26:22.076 --> 00:26:23.450
SHIRLEY MANSON:
Well, the concert

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:25.920
that we're currently
doing, half of the material

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:28.530
is songs that nobody's
ever heard before.

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:30.205
And what is really
exciting about it,

00:26:30.205 --> 00:26:31.580
although we were
nervous about it

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:37.880
beforehand, if you create
enough magic, sonic magic,

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.345
emotional magic, people
are invested in that,

00:26:40.345 --> 00:26:41.720
they're invested
in that journey.

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:42.820
They will listen.

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:44.220
And if the songs
are good enough,

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:47.600
which we think they are,
people come along with you.

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:53.930
And they seem to respond
to that sort of risk.

00:26:53.930 --> 00:27:00.480
Everybody enjoys
unexpected, like experience.

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.110
It's like breaking an algorithm.

00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:03.485
You know, all of
a sudden you're,

00:27:03.485 --> 00:27:06.060
like, whoa, OK, this is
actually tremendously

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:09.000
successful for us,
at a time when it

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.897
could have gone the other way.

00:27:11.897 --> 00:27:14.480
LAURA PARAGANO: What do you all
feel is the role of an artist?

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:17.090
Is that to make magic?

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:18.800
Just to be authentic
for yourselves?

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:22.850
To try and communicate
a particular message

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:25.710
to your listeners?

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:29.110
SHIRLEY MANSON: Connect,
connect, connection.

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:30.140
That's how I see it.

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:31.800
I don't know if everyone
else sees it that way.

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:32.990
BUTCH VIG: Shirley
mentioned this earlier,

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:35.000
we make music for the
four of ourselves.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.330
It's a very intimate process.

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:43.160
And fascinating, and
sometimes frustrating,

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.139
and we can get very emotional.

00:27:45.139 --> 00:27:46.680
We produce and all
co-write together.

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:48.020
So it is a democracy.

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:49.860
And it's not easy
being in a band where

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.720
everybody has an equal voice.

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.870
Most of bands I've produced,
there's one leader.

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:55.590
And in some ways,
those are easier bands

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:57.340
to deal with, because
you go to one person

00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:58.920
to get decisions made.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.930
But I think because
we work this way is

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:03.230
why we sound like we are.

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:08.790
And it's just, there's something
about when we create music,

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:12.570
we need to express how we
feel, through Shirley's lyrics

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:14.124
and just sonically
what we're doing.

00:28:14.124 --> 00:28:15.540
I think the great
thing that we've

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:17.730
found is, especially
on this tour is,

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:20.010
playing these obscure
songs, that the music

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:22.630
has connected and really
touched a lot of our fans.

00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:25.705
And that is really
an incredible,

00:28:25.705 --> 00:28:29.030
we just want to say thank
you for letting us know that.

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:31.160
Because we make music
in a bubble and we

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.020
have no idea if we
will connect or not.

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:34.520
And I think we're
very lucky that we

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:37.970
do have a lot of fans who
really take heart to what we do.

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:40.850
And our fans are the reason
we're here today, why

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:42.800
we get to keep making music.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:46.250
So it's connecting,
you make music

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:48.650
to hopefully connect on some
sort of emotional level.

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:53.950
LAURA PARAGANO: Do you
wish that you can make it

00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:54.940
outside of a bubble?

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:58.000
Or do you appreciate being
able to come together

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.520
as just the four
of you and focus

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:07.590
without needing to think
outside of this group?

00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:09.840
STEVE MARKER: I think we've
benefited a lot from being

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:13.150
from Madison, Wisconsin, where
there's no record industry

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:15.756
and we were very, very insular.

00:29:15.756 --> 00:29:17.130
Nobody was telling
us what to do.

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:19.900
We didn't really know what
was going on on the coasts,

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:23.460
to tell you the truth,
which I think was good.

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:24.480
They just left us alone.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:28.550
And then we get signed
to some big labels.

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:33.210
So yeah, I think the four
people in a small room trying

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:35.340
to come up with something
doesn't always work,

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:36.798
but when it does,
it's really cool,

00:29:36.798 --> 00:29:39.435
and that process is
really precious to us.

00:29:39.435 --> 00:29:42.336
And I think we
want to keep that.

00:29:42.336 --> 00:29:43.710
BUTCH VIG: Yeah,
the few times we

00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:45.035
worked with outside producers--

00:29:45.035 --> 00:29:45.390
STEVE MARKER: It didn't work.

00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:46.800
BUTCH VIG: It didn't work.

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.720
SHIRLEY MANSON: [LAUGHS]

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:51.262
LAURA PARAGANO: You couldn't
see the creative vision through.

00:29:51.262 --> 00:29:53.261
BUTCH VIG: We tried it
just because we were just

00:29:53.261 --> 00:29:54.990
trying to do something
new at the time,

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:57.370
and it just didn't work.

00:29:57.370 --> 00:29:59.790
I think, because the four
of us are so opinionated,

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:01.800
you can't have a fifth opinion.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.950
We have done a bunch of
one-off like record store day

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:08.640
collaborations, with
Brody from the Distillers,

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.620
and Brian Aubert from
Silversun Pickups.

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:12.100
And we have a new
one coming out.

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:13.475
But those are just
one-off songs.

00:30:13.475 --> 00:30:15.999
It's really fun to do that,
because when you do that,

00:30:15.999 --> 00:30:18.540
with another artist, that puts
you in a different head space.

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:20.760
You want to meet them
and then sort of figure

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:22.290
out what they're going to do.

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:24.120
And you get feedback
off that person.

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:26.120
That's always fresh for
us, because usually it's

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:28.369
just the four of us and our
engineer, Billy, in a room

00:30:28.369 --> 00:30:29.055
together.

00:30:29.055 --> 00:30:31.460
So when you do get that chance
to go with someone else,

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:31.990
it's cool.

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:36.180
It's just another
perspective, which is good.

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:38.550
LAURA PARAGANO: Speaking a
little bit on collaboration,

00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:41.250
I know you guys have
heard about Magenta, which

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:45.150
is a Google project that's
using artificial intelligence

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:46.307
to create a different--

00:30:46.307 --> 00:30:47.723
BUTCH VIG: Put us
out of business.

00:30:47.723 --> 00:30:48.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:50.323
LAURA PARAGANO: That
is not their intention,

00:30:50.323 --> 00:30:52.530
as I was told to mention.

00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:57.161
Have you collaborated with a
technological entity like that

00:30:57.161 --> 00:30:57.660
before?

00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:02.020
What do you think is that
kind of project's role

00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:05.040
in the creative process?

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.040
BUTCH VIG: I don't know.

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:06.900
I'm curious to see.

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:07.435
We're going to it today, right?

00:31:07.435 --> 00:31:08.360
STEVE MARKER: We
haven't seen it yet.

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.060
DUKE ERIKSON: We
haven't seen it yet.

00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:11.435
BUTCH VIG: Every
now and then, we

00:31:11.435 --> 00:31:13.780
get asked a question
about can technology

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:16.450
make music as good as humans.

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:20.122
And I'm sure that there are
algorithms that could come up

00:31:20.122 --> 00:31:21.580
with interesting
chord progressions

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:23.690
and great melodies and stuff.

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:25.850
To me, the most
important thing, for me,

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:28.760
personally, about a song, is
the sound or the human voice

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:30.276
and the lyrics.

00:31:30.276 --> 00:31:32.525
And no computer will
ever emulate that.

00:31:32.525 --> 00:31:33.900
I just don't think
it's possible.

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:35.233
SHIRLEY MANSON: Never say never.

00:31:35.233 --> 00:31:35.819
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:35.819 --> 00:31:37.110
BUTCH VIG: I just don't think--

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:41.610
I can't see it being authentic.

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:44.700
I can't see a computer
being authentic.

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:48.710
SHIRLEY MANSON: 20 years
ago, we were, well,

00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:52.540
you were, not so much
me, but directly involved

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:55.176
with Christopher
Bock of Digidesign.

00:31:55.176 --> 00:31:58.170
And he was very
involved in working

00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:00.990
with the band, the
men in particular

00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:02.640
here, because at
this point, I was

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:07.900
totally uninterested in anything
technological, truth be told.

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:10.260
But you were on the phone
with him constantly, I

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:11.460
felt, back then.

00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:17.870
BUTCH VIG: Like I said,
we're curious today.

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:23.630
I could see using sort of
algorithms and computers,

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:26.610
to come up with sounds
that might start a song,

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:29.375
or might take it somewhere
that you wouldn't know,

00:32:29.375 --> 00:32:32.490
that you wouldn't
be ready to go to.

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:34.310
Because we have a sensibility.

00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:37.820
If we plug in guitars or
drums, we play a certain way.

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:41.300
But I think if you introduce
something that can give you

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:42.710
a different
perspective, it might

00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:44.840
shape the way a
Garbage song goes,

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:46.190
and that could be really cool.

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:49.010
I think that's why we're really
interested in seeing what kind

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:51.212
of technology you all got.

00:32:51.212 --> 00:32:52.670
LAURA PARAGANO:
Absolutely, I can't

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:55.040
wait to see if you make
something completely brand

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:55.810
new out of it.

00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:56.900
BUTCH VIG: Yeah.

00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:59.180
LAURA PARAGANO: I
think maybe it's

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:01.970
going to be time soon to
open up the floor to Q and A.

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:05.320
So we're going to have
a mic in the back.

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:09.380
If anybody would like to
step up, or make a line,

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:12.910
by all means, we'd love to
hear what you've got to ask.

00:33:15.936 --> 00:33:16.477
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:16.477 --> 00:33:17.570
STEVE MARKER: Hi.

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:23.190
AUDIENCE: So, understandably,
this conversation

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:25.560
has been pretty focused
on how technology

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:30.540
interacts with the process of
music production itself, right?

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:33.270
What I'm wondering is,
as technology sort of

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:35.989
has like broader cultural
implications, how

00:33:35.989 --> 00:33:38.280
those sort of effect the
music that you all are making.

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:41.490
For example, and I'm sorry,
this is a very personal thing

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:45.540
for me, you have a song,
"Androgyny," which spoke

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:48.210
to me at a really young age.

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:52.085
And I mean, I don't
know, I probably

00:33:52.085 --> 00:33:54.210
wasn't old enough at the
time to sort of understand

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:57.570
how it was broadly perceived,
but I have to imagine,

00:33:57.570 --> 00:34:00.150
given its lyrical content,
that it was pretty progressive

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:01.310
for the time.

00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:08.830
Now, those sentiments-- sorry,
I can't recite the lyrics,

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:10.250
are more broadly shared.

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:15.420
So I'm wondering, as technology
has sort of shaped culture

00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:18.420
more broadly, has that
affected sort of how you all

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:24.250
think about your music and sort
of what you're speaking to?

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:25.449
Does that make sense?

00:34:25.449 --> 00:34:26.969
SHIRLEY MANSON: It
does make sense.

00:34:26.969 --> 00:34:30.420
Again, I don't think it's
necessarily changed the way

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:33.300
we want to make music.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:40.880
What it has changed is the
galvanization of ideas.

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:48.980
Something like androgyny, back
then, was perceived as a little

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:49.620
out there.

00:34:54.039 --> 00:34:58.780
And nowadays, I feel
like these messages

00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:04.130
that deal with taboos or deal
with things that are considered

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:09.950
still marginalized voices,
through the Internet,

00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:17.096
we can find our people
and find our base.

00:35:17.096 --> 00:35:21.450
And it's been an incredible
tool in that regard,

00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:25.250
of like pinpointing where
people's sympathies lie

00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:28.490
and where you share an
ideology or philosophy.

00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:33.060
And that has also worked also
to all of our detriments.

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:37.910
But it's also a
beautiful, amazing thing,

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:41.760
that you can find your audience
much faster and broader,

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.430
and all over the world.

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:45.050
And that's incredible.

00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:47.160
And I think it
connects people who

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:51.670
have felt marginalized in ways
that we've never seen before.

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:53.690
And I think that's
why we are beginning

00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:57.994
to see a lot of change
in a certain field.

00:35:57.994 --> 00:35:59.554
And it's exciting.

00:35:59.554 --> 00:36:01.220
I mean, we've all got
a long ways to go,

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:07.910
but it's still pretty rad that
we can all galvanize and stand

00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:10.310
behind things that we
believe so strongly in.

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:11.630
Does that answer your question?

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:12.752
I'm so sorry--

00:36:12.752 --> 00:36:14.627
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:14.627 --> 00:36:15.710
SHIRLEY MANSON: Thank you.

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:18.170
I like your shade of lipstick.

00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:20.276
It's similar to mine.

00:36:20.276 --> 00:36:23.660
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:28.905
AUDIENCE: I wanted to ask about
"Version 2.0," 20 years later,

00:36:28.905 --> 00:36:32.300
now that you guys are
looking back on that album,

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:34.970
is there anything that you would
have changed about that album,

00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:37.147
or songs that you
would have included,

00:36:37.147 --> 00:36:38.730
like "Soldier Through
This"-- it would

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:41.712
have made me so happy to
see that on the album.

00:36:41.712 --> 00:36:43.920
DUKE ERIKSON: That's obviously
one of your favorites.

00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:50.730
I think that we're really proud
of this record the way it is.

00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:54.030
I think any time you put
out something like that,

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:56.690
you can look back at it 20
years later, and two days later,

00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:59.190
and think maybe you should have
done this a little different

00:36:59.190 --> 00:36:59.740
or that.

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:01.660
But it is what it is.

00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:04.490
And we worked really hard
on it for a long time.

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:09.360
And the "Soldier Through
This" and songs, those B-sides

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:12.020
all came after the
record, for the most part.

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:13.520
They were B-sides
that were demanded

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:18.870
that we record for
single releases in the UK

00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:21.150
and so forth.

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:22.750
So that was a later one.

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:26.410
But some of the B-sides,
we think are pretty strong.

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:29.429
And they were written in like 10
minutes and recorded in a day.

00:37:29.429 --> 00:37:31.720
I don't know why we didn't
do the whole album that way.

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:35.760
Thanks for the question.

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.176
SHIRLEY MANSON:
Thank you, though.

00:37:40.289 --> 00:37:42.080
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
thanks for being here.

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:44.490
I have a question
about ownership.

00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:46.500
It sounds like you
value ownership

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:50.386
over the process of
music production.

00:37:50.386 --> 00:37:53.560
When you use platforms,
like social media platforms,

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:55.842
you don't have a lot
of ownership over you

00:37:55.842 --> 00:37:57.300
how you communicate
with your fans.

00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:01.050
Like for example, Facebook
might change a policy,

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:04.761
like you cannot send group
messages anymore without paying

00:38:04.761 --> 00:38:05.260
for it.

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:07.950
Like those kinds of
things, you give away

00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:14.250
a certain part of control over
communicating with your fans.

00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:15.700
How do deal with that?

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:18.637
And then, how does
that affect you?

00:38:18.637 --> 00:38:20.220
SHIRLEY MANSON: We've
had more control

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:23.790
over how we communicate with our
fans now than we've ever done.

00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:26.400
So things change, and
you have to adapt.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:28.530
I mean, as an artist, if
you don't adapt, you die.

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:29.920
It's as simple as that.

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:35.040
If you refuse to move with the
changes, you'll be drowned.

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:37.230
And we're lucky that
we worked with a man

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:40.050
that we've trusted for a long
time, our manager, Paul Kremen.

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:41.790
We worked with him
at the beginning,

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:44.960
and he's been with us
throughout our entire career

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:46.140
at this point.

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:49.315
And he originally ran our
record label, basically.

00:38:49.315 --> 00:38:53.790
And because he has a great
background in marketing

00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:56.470
and has a great
grasp of industry,

00:38:56.470 --> 00:39:01.290
he has forced us
at times to adapt.

00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:03.590
And we've strongly fought him.

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:06.700
And that's been
fights, and hysteria,

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:10.280
and me telling someone
to [INAUDIBLE]..

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:12.690
But he has pushed
us to sort of--

00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:15.060
embrace streaming,
for a random example.

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:18.920
Which we were so
against and offended by.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:23.880
And are still offended by the
way musicians are compensated.

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:26.610
But as Paul so
rightly pointed out,

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:30.120
better to be compensated a
small amount than no amount.

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:33.870
So things like that, we have
people around us that really

00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:38.820
push us to sort of
try and stay on top

00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:42.281
of the changes in social
media and in technology.

00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:48.280
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.470
SHIRLEY MANSON: Hello.

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:51.178
AUDIENCE: One of the
things you mentioned

00:39:51.178 --> 00:39:55.170
is, you talked about how the
technology from the early days

00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:58.380
kind of caught up in maybe
what was strange or weird

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:01.920
or, as an Indie kid, myself
probably liked [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:03.330
back in the day.

00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:07.860
Is there anything in technology
today that kind of something

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:11.040
new, or even maybe
something musicians

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:14.460
are doing with technology, that
kind of seems new today that

00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:17.052
interests you at all?

00:40:17.052 --> 00:40:19.010
SHIRLEY MANSON: Well,
the VR stuff for a start,

00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:20.220
I mean, holy cow.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.240
That's mind boggling
what people are

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:28.150
beginning to achieve
with that and where

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:29.150
they're going with that.

00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:35.280
And mixing sounds with
visuals, and I think

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:37.140
that's kind of blown us away.

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:40.870
STEVE MARKER: That's what really
interests me moving forward,

00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:44.120
the mixed reality stuff and
augmented reality stuff.

00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:45.870
It's going to be amazing.

00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:48.810
BUTCH VIG: I really like a lot
of the new virtual instruments

00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:51.717
that are coming out, especially
the sound design type ones.

00:40:51.717 --> 00:40:54.300
I mean, there's a ton of great
pianos, and organs, and synths,

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:58.160
but I sort of
gravitate to the ones,

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:01.290
like using Reactor and
Native instruments.

00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:05.885
There's always super cool,
hard to describe platforms

00:41:05.885 --> 00:41:08.010
you can get for them, like
one called [INAUDIBLE],,

00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:09.930
which just makes the
most insane noise.

00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:11.810
You can't even really
program it at all.

00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:14.435
And it's made by a third party,
I don't even know who makes it.

00:41:14.435 --> 00:41:17.430
But I find all that
stuff interesting.

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:19.740
I had a background in
film when I went to UW.

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:21.330
And I like textures in sound.

00:41:21.330 --> 00:41:23.410
You can hear that in a
lot of Garbage songs.

00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:26.100
There's a lot of layers of sort
of subversive sounding things

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:26.900
in the background.

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:28.800
And so I'm constantly
sort of tinkering

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:32.220
with a lot of those
new plug-ins that

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:36.670
gets sounds that are atypical
from stock instrumental sounds.

00:41:43.972 --> 00:41:45.430
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for being here.

00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:47.980
So "The World is Not
Enough," still to this day

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:50.510
my favorite "James Bond" song.

00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:52.750
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:55.480
And there have been
plenty of them.

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:59.320
My question is being featured
in a movie like that, what kind

00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:01.785
of an impact do you think
it had on the longevity

00:42:01.785 --> 00:42:02.410
of your career?

00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:08.570
SHIRLEY MANSON: I think
it had quite an impact.

00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:12.440
I mean, that kind of exposure
it gave us was insane.

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:14.540
We had never seen
anything like it, really.

00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:20.390
And to have a big movie
company behind us was intense.

00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:24.920
I mean, it was not the
easiest of partnerships.

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:27.430
The music business
is like a playground

00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:29.140
compared to the movie business.

00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:30.760
There's a lot of
investment involved

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:36.500
and a lot of interference that
we didn't take too kindly to.

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:37.992
BUTCH VIG: No, we didn't, no.

00:42:37.992 --> 00:42:39.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:41.780
SHIRLEY MANSON: But to
have that in our arsenal

00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:43.920
is extraordinary.

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:44.930
It's still a thrill.

00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:48.060
Every night, I'm like I cannot
believe I'm singing a "Bond"

00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:51.540
song, this is mad, you know.

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:54.520
So, yeah, we were very
fortunate to get that

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:56.590
at that particular
moment in our career.

00:42:56.590 --> 00:42:58.330
And it just sort of topped--

00:42:58.330 --> 00:43:01.070
it was the cherry on the top
of our really successful record

00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:02.970
campaign of "Version 2.0."

00:43:02.970 --> 00:43:05.680
And just sort of as
everything was dwindling,

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:08.310
we got this incredible gig.

00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:12.770
And it allowed our touring
to continue for another six

00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:13.470
to eight months.

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:17.800
And so it was
extraordinarily fortuitous.

00:43:20.429 --> 00:43:21.262
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:21.262 --> 00:43:22.262
STEVE MARKER: Thank you.

00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:30.540
AUDIENCE: Shirley, you've
been a very strong role

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:33.510
model for women over the years.

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:35.160
Do you ever find that--

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:38.959
do you find that important
or intimidating in any way?

00:43:38.959 --> 00:43:40.750
SHIRLEY MANSON: I don't
really think of it,

00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:41.958
to be honest, in those terms.

00:43:41.958 --> 00:43:46.600
I just try and live my life
the way I think is appropriate.

00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:49.800
I have been quite
blown away by the love

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:51.710
that I've received
from a lot of women.

00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:55.770
And it is a great honor
for me anytime a woman

00:43:55.770 --> 00:43:57.960
comes up and says, you
helped me with this,

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:00.730
or something you said
spurred me to do that.

00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:03.660
But I never think
of myself in any way

00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:05.836
as a good example of humanity.

00:44:05.836 --> 00:44:10.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:11.510
I mean, I'm lucky.

00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:14.040
I don't know why I'm like
this, but I don't really

00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:16.390
think about it very much.

00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:18.570
And I think that's
probably just as well.

00:44:18.570 --> 00:44:20.520
Maybe that keeps me sane.

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:23.670
But I am a feminist.

00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:26.890
I believe in the
principles of feminism.

00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:29.550
I feel now, more than ever,
women are under siege,

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:31.570
and I want to speak up about it.

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:34.680
And particularly for
women, black women,

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:38.610
and for colored women,
these are treacherous times

00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:39.610
we're living in.

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:43.560
And so now more than ever,
I make myself speak up,

00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:46.470
even when it's uncomfortable.

00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:47.877
Because I think it's an outrage.

00:44:47.877 --> 00:44:49.710
I think what's going
on in America currently

00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:51.100
is an outrage.

00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:53.088
And it breaks my heart.

00:44:53.088 --> 00:44:53.588
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:53.588 --> 00:44:56.871
BUTCH VIG: Here-here.

00:44:56.871 --> 00:45:00.390
SHIRLEY MANSON: So,
yeah, but we press on.

00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:01.790
We will endure.

00:45:05.344 --> 00:45:06.510
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:09.780
This is so awesome.

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:13.190
You mentioned that
you, in live shows,

00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:16.790
you use a lot of sequencers
to preserve your sound.

00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:19.640
How does that
affect your ability

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:24.155
to maybe improvise, be in the
moment, react to the crowd

00:45:24.155 --> 00:45:25.090
and to the moment?

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:29.610
STEVE MARKER: We've
got the technology now

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:33.040
so we can change things
up to a certain extent

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:36.280
pretty easily, if
in the sound check,

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:38.530
we feel like something's
the wrong tempo

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:40.072
or something like that.

00:45:40.072 --> 00:45:43.780
Butch is able now to--

00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:46.490
we can go to any song
pretty much that we know,

00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:48.940
and it doesn't have
to be a locked in set

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:50.109
if we don't want it to be.

00:45:50.109 --> 00:45:51.400
So it's a little more flexible.

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:55.030
We're not a jam band and
don't want to be either.

00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:59.210
So we've got to a comfortable
place now I'd say.

00:45:59.210 --> 00:46:01.485
BUTCH VIG: Steve hates that
term jamming, by the way.

00:46:01.485 --> 00:46:02.405
He just hates it.

00:46:02.405 --> 00:46:02.523
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:02.523 --> 00:46:03.355
STEVE MARKER: Yeah.

00:46:03.355 --> 00:46:07.030
BUTCH VIG: You know, if
you hear any of our shows,

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:10.480
we try to play exactly the
same, as perfect as we can

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.190
every night, and
we're not even close.

00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:13.815
Every night it's different.

00:46:13.815 --> 00:46:15.770
The guitar riffs are a
little bit different,

00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:16.890
my drumming changes.

00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:18.790
Shirley ad libs
vocals all the time.

00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:22.780
So every night is--

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:23.870
its own thing.

00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:26.470
And we realized a
long time ago, we

00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:28.955
don't want to sound exactly
like our album anymore.

00:46:28.955 --> 00:46:31.330
If that were the case, just
put the album on, and the PA,

00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:33.290
and we'll just set up
on stage and dance.

00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:35.950
So recording is one thing.

00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:38.230
And music should be
listened to that way.

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:39.800
When you go see a
live experience,

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:41.650
it should just be that
moment in the room.

00:46:41.650 --> 00:46:43.725
And every night should be
a little bit different.

00:46:43.725 --> 00:46:45.600
SHIRLEY MANSON: But we
are currently limited.

00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:48.370
But I'm sure that's
going to change.

00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:52.930
Where I would imagine at some
point, we'll get to the point

00:46:52.930 --> 00:46:57.670
where the brain at the back,
the machine at the back

00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:59.270
can adapt really quickly.

00:46:59.270 --> 00:47:03.150
So I would imagine,
in my wildest dreams,

00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:08.290
that by a flick of a button,
we can elongate a section,

00:47:08.290 --> 00:47:09.147
shorten a section.

00:47:09.147 --> 00:47:11.230
I mean, that would be
amazing if we could do that.

00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:12.480
DUKE ERIKSON: Work
on that, will you?

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:14.646
SHIRLEY MANSON: Yeah, if
somebody here could come up

00:47:14.646 --> 00:47:16.240
with that, that would be wild.

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:19.612
BUTCH VIG: I'm sure the could.

00:47:19.612 --> 00:47:22.510
AUDIENCE: Actually a
quick follow up to that.

00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:25.000
When your tours
are being booked,

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.030
are you asking for
certain types of venues?

00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:30.760
Because sometimes certain
groups will sound terrible

00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:33.880
in a real boomy
place, and some groups

00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:36.970
might want a really
small club atmosphere.

00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:39.490
Are you pushing for a
certain type of venue?

00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:41.480
Or is that just out
of your control?

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:45.140
And do you recompose if you're
in a venue that's just going

00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:46.682
to sound terrible otherwise?

00:47:46.682 --> 00:47:49.838
SHIRLEY MANSON: [LAUGHS] You
make me feel really inadequate.

00:47:49.838 --> 00:47:51.294
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:51.294 --> 00:47:52.980
STEVE MARKER: Really.

00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:55.690
SHIRLEY MANSON: Yeah, we have no
control really over the venues

00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:58.180
we play, unfortunately.

00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:00.010
I mean, we often
step into a venue,

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:02.260
and you'll realize
that the PA is stacked

00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:04.600
behind the mic,
which means you're

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:07.709
in for a bad night,
things like that.

00:48:07.709 --> 00:48:09.000
And there's nothing you can do.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.320
You can't re-hang a PA.

00:48:13.505 --> 00:48:17.880
So, yeah, it's complicated and
a bit of a nightmare sometimes.

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:20.090
But you just have
to get on with it.

00:48:20.090 --> 00:48:20.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:20.970 --> 00:48:24.740
Yeah, I noticed that.

00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:26.740
That's why our sound
engineer's been struggling,

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:29.830
it's like you're
screwed, basically.

00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:31.600
But, yeah, what were
you going to say?

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:33.558
BUTCH VIG: It's sort of
what you're saying too.

00:48:33.558 --> 00:48:36.150
For me, the first thing, I
get up and hit the bass drum,

00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:38.700
and sometimes it's just
tight and other times, boom,

00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:40.830
it comes back like
four seconds later,

00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:42.530
twice as loud as
when you hit it.

00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:44.620
And that affects
everybody on the stage.

00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:47.120
And we're like, oh, my god,
this is going to be a nightmare.

00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:49.800
And unfortunately,
our monitor mixer,

00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:52.607
he probably has a heart attack
through most of the set,

00:48:52.607 --> 00:48:54.690
because every song, he's
struggling to try and get

00:48:54.690 --> 00:48:56.850
our mixes dialed in.

00:48:56.850 --> 00:48:58.650
You realize you just
have to roll with it,

00:48:58.650 --> 00:49:02.945
because every stage
does sound different.

00:49:02.945 --> 00:49:04.330
AUDIENCE: Hey, guys.

00:49:04.330 --> 00:49:07.270
So actually, this question
is really for Butch.

00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:09.760
So Butch, before the
inception of Garbage,

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:12.400
you were a fairly well-known
person in the music industry.

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:14.530
And you may have
just produced one

00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:17.570
of the most generational
albums of all time,

00:49:17.570 --> 00:49:21.800
from this triplet
from the Seattle area.

00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:23.480
So if you were to--

00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:24.940
I have two questions on this.

00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:26.800
If you were to do
"Nevermind" again,

00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:30.259
would you change something,
knowing what you know today?

00:49:30.259 --> 00:49:32.800
And then, second question-- this
is a really minute question.

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:35.270
My favorite song of that
album is "Drain You"

00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:37.030
because the intro of that song--

00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:38.740
I don't know, as an
amateur producer,

00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:39.640
I don't no idea how you did it.

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:40.556
BUTCH VIG: Which song?

00:49:40.556 --> 00:49:42.832
AUDIENCE: "Drain You"
with Kurt Cobain.

00:49:42.832 --> 00:49:44.790
BUTCH VIG: With all those
little sound effects?

00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:45.020
Right?

00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:45.840
Are there little--

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:48.220
AUDIENCE: It just starts with
Kurt Cobain singing and playing

00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:50.460
the guitar and the guitar
sounds like ridiculously--

00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:52.210
BUTCH VIG: Oh, yeah, [SINGING]

00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:54.660
AUDIENCE: Exactly, that one.

00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:57.530
BUTCH VIG: Well, to
answer the first question,

00:49:57.530 --> 00:49:59.400
if I produced
"Nevermind" now, there's

00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:01.288
a good chance I
might fuck it up.

00:50:01.288 --> 00:50:03.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:06.330
Because I'd probably
use Pro Tools,

00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:08.655
and we probably would not
have gone to Sound City.

00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:12.740
I mean, there was a
combination of things.

00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:14.930
The band rehearsed for six
months every single day.

00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:16.220
They were tight when
we went in there.

00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:18.230
The sound of that room,
Sound City, is amazing.

00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:19.730
Dave Grohl had just
joined the band.

00:50:19.730 --> 00:50:22.430
He's one of the best drummers,
rock drummers in the world.

00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:24.120
They had written
brilliant songs.

00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:28.310
That Neve board in Sound
City has a sound to it.

00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:30.360
So there were all
those X factors.

00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:32.330
But then there's also
the factor of the time

00:50:32.330 --> 00:50:34.400
that people were looking
for a record like that.

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:36.770
If "Nevermind" came
out today, there's

00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:38.762
no way it would have
the same impact.

00:50:38.762 --> 00:50:39.470
It just wouldn't.

00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:41.136
It would be scrutinized
in social media,

00:50:41.136 --> 00:50:44.446
like Shirley said, probably
dead in 48 or 72 hours.

00:50:44.446 --> 00:50:46.070
People would move on
to something else.

00:50:46.070 --> 00:50:48.917
It wouldn't have
that sort of magic,

00:50:48.917 --> 00:50:51.500
because it came out at a time,
when I think people, coming out

00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:52.640
the '80s, I think
they were looking

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:54.140
for some sort of
profound change.

00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:57.082
And that album
resonated with people.

00:50:57.082 --> 00:50:59.540
I was very lucky, we all were,
that it was the right timing

00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:01.689
for that record.

00:51:01.689 --> 00:51:03.230
"Drain You," I can't
really remember,

00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:05.700
I think the guitar
sound is probably--

00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:07.470
I think Kurt probably played--

00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:10.260
he had [INAUDIBLE] and I
think I brought in a Box AC30

00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:12.180
for a lot of the clean guitars.

00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:15.090
I'm pretty sure we used
a Box AC30 on the intro.

00:51:17.187 --> 00:51:18.770
LAURA PARAGANO:
Unfortunately, I think

00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:20.730
that is all the time
that we have for today.

00:51:20.730 --> 00:51:21.840
Thank you so much
for taking the time.

00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:23.280
SHIRLEY MANSON:
Thank you so much.

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:25.130
[APPLAUSE]
