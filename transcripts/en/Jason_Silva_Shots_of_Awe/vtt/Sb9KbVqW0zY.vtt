JASON SILVA: There
was a great scene

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.210
in a movie about
these two brothers

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.140
that wished to become writers.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.410
We start learning about the
story of their unfolding lives,

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.140
the drama of their every day.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.965
One of the guys falls
in love, and then

00:00:29.965 --> 00:00:34.080
his girlfriend commits suicide;
something utterly tragic

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.490
erupts in his life.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.573
And then the film continues,
and, all of a sudden,

00:00:37.573 --> 00:00:40.390
there's a scent that shows
him frantically writing down.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.590
And the narrator tells
us he felt guilty

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.720
over the creativity triggered
by his lover's death.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.460
This notion that tragedy
can lead to breakthrough,

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.710
can lead to rebirth, that
the instances of suffering

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.030
in our lives can
actually inspire

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.145
us to make beautiful art is a
sort of paradoxical ecstasy,

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:04.830
that we can take our wounds, and
we can turn them into something

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.270
larger, that we need not
have suffered in vain game

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.054
is a wild idea, because
it doesn't mean that we

00:01:11.054 --> 00:01:12.220
are happy for our suffering.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.239
It doesn't mean that we
wished for these tragic things

00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:15.776
to happen to us
as artists, but it

00:01:15.776 --> 00:01:17.736
means that we're able
to take that pain,

00:01:17.736 --> 00:01:22.266
take that aching rhapsody and
output something in the world

00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:23.940
and make a contribution.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.352
Because at least that
way, we validate the fact

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:27.910
that we exist.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.290
We affirm ourselves.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.390
We have no choice but to do so.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.990
In the face of entropy,
in the face of death,

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.340
to not say that we exist
is to not live at all.
