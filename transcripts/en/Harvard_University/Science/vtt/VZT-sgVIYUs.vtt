00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.040
So usually, what I do in the lab is I grow a bunch of E. Coli and I give the

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.870
E. Coli DNA and the E. Coli cells take the DNA and give me my protein back,

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.100
but we don't want to bring live bacteria like E.coli into classrooms.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.635
To engineer Biology, you need complicated equipment,

00:00:21.635 --> 00:00:23.740
you need fancy labs.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.770
And as a result, most middle schools, most high schools,

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.325
and many colleges are not actually appropriately

00:00:30.325 --> 00:00:33.980
equipped in order to teach kids the basics of synthetic biology.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.200
You can imagine these schools are

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.350
struggling with STEM funding already and now you're asking

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.630
them to basically have all the equipment they need for

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.090
a BL1 lab and that includes things like freezers,

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.340
refrigerators, incubators that shake.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.235
And one of the things we really set out to do in these bio-bits papers, both bio-bits bright,

00:00:52.235 --> 00:00:55.340
and bio-bits explorer is to kind of change that paradigm.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.415
We're creating essentially low cost educational kits

00:00:59.415 --> 00:01:02.830
that could be used in a classroom setting for less than $100.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.175
What I did is I took all the machinery that we need to build the proteins,

00:01:07.175 --> 00:01:10.340
out of the cells, and put them into these little tubes.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.770
So, we can actually make proteins using

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.130
these little pellets without having to grow E. Coli.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.005
Now at a high level what we've done is create

00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:21.370
the synthetic biology equivalent to the old chemistry kits.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.060
They're inexpensive, easy to use, easy to store,

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.010
can be conducted actually in more or less any room,

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.000
and the nature of the kit is the idea that you can freeze dry cell-free extracts.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.790
And what that means is you rip off the cell wall and you collect the guts of the cell.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.990
You can kind of think about that like taking a car and you open the hood and you take

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.530
the engine and you put it over here and so what

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.330
we had have done is we've taken the engine out of a cell.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.700
Like the ribosomes, the amino acids,

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.740
that kind of thing and put it into

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.985
a separate solution and if we just add the DNA to that solution,

00:01:55.985 --> 00:01:58.030
transcription and translation will happen and

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.330
you'll get your protein output.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.820
So we're going to add DNA to

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.635
these little pellets and then we're going to put them in our little warming incubator.

00:02:06.635 --> 00:02:08.990
So we have the BioBits bright kit, where we use

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.160
these freeze-dried cell-free reactions to synthesize fluorescent proteins.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.760
And this allows educators to teach components such as the central dogma:

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.220
DNA goes to MRNA goes to proteins.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.930
So for example in one of our labs,

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.380
students take an eight-well strip of

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.800
these freeze-dried cell-free reactions and by just adding different amounts of DNA,

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.599
they show that they can synthesize

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.880
different amounts of fluorescent proteins in our test tubes.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.270
In our second lab, we give students a 96-w ell plate of

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.600
freeze-dried cell-free reactions and we then

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.810
challenge them to build their own in vitro synthetic program,

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.000
which in their case means painting a picture with these fluorescent protein reactions.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.064
They can make a rainbow, a periodic table,

00:02:49.064 --> 00:02:51.830
and that allows educators to start to talk

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.195
about how synthetic biologists might control biology.

00:02:55.195 --> 00:02:57.565
So you guys made fluorescent proteins.

00:02:57.565 --> 00:02:58.880
Yay!

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.190
While the bright kit focuses on expression of fluorescent proteins,

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.200
the explorer kit introduces a number of new modules that go

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.345
beyond just simple fluorescent protein expression.

00:03:09.345 --> 00:03:11.695
Showing that we can do other outputs as well,

00:03:11.695 --> 00:03:15.300
such as smells, tactile-based hydrogels,

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.870
and the fruit sensors.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.845
You remember why we are adding the soap?

00:03:18.845 --> 00:03:21.960
To help break the cells. To bust open the cells.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.530
A really popular biology experiment that teachers do

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.400
now is the fruit DNA extraction experiment.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.600
You basically mash up the fruit and you extract

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.330
the DNA from it and that's the end of the lesson right there,

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.130
but with the cell-free sensors now, you can add on to that.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.515
It actually detect if something is a banana or something is a kiwi.

00:03:42.515 --> 00:03:44.980
You can really tell that is a banana.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.570
So the sensor could tell the difference

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.450
between all these different fruits and all it's always based on the DNA.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:51.685
That's really cool.

00:03:51.685 --> 00:03:53.395
So for the tactile outputs,

00:03:53.395 --> 00:03:56.630
we have the students express enzymes and

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.970
these enzymes are able to convert peptides into hydrogels.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.770
Woah, this is cool!

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.810
For the smell-based outputs,

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.050
we are able to express enzyme called ATF1 and ATF1 is able to

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:18.155
convert Isoamyl alcohol into Isoamyl acetate which is another word for banana oil.

00:04:18.155 --> 00:04:21.035
That's so cool. It smells like bananas.

00:04:21.035 --> 00:04:22.280
You know, our effort has been done in

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.385
very tight collaboration with Northwestern University, Mike Jewett's lab.

00:04:26.385 --> 00:04:29.510
Our team has included

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.430
really talented grad students and postdocs from MIT and the Wyss institute.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.779
So from the outset,

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:41.025
we engaged as many educators as we could both in the university level as well as outside.

00:04:41.025 --> 00:04:42.950
Mike Jewett's team actually already has

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.715
integrated and tested their kits in the Chicago school systems.

00:04:46.715 --> 00:04:51.320
We actually put these reactions into the hands of K12 teachers and students.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.150
Had them run them. They had never seen these reactions before.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.310
It was their first time running

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.920
the experiments and we showed that they worked and that actually

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.000
that their results were comparable to experiments that I set up.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.290
It's often times those hands on opportunities where you really

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.770
get to touch the science that can be transformative.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.700
I think that that's what we hope these kids are.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.125
We want them to be open access.

00:05:14.125 --> 00:05:15.970
We want everyone to be able to engage in them.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:21.340
And it would be incredibly satisfying to see if we inspired a small number if

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.425
not a large number of kids to consider

00:05:23.425 --> 00:05:27.760
careers in biomedical research as a result of these kits.
