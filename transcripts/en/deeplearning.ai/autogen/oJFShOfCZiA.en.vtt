00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
actually not because we thought that it

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:23.930 align:start position:0%
multiple times as well is unsupervised
learning<00:11:21.890><c> yeah</c><00:11:22.950><c> can</c><00:11:23.160><c> you</c><00:11:23.250><c> share</c><00:11:23.910><c> your</c>

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
