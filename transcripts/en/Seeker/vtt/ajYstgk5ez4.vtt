Ting: Mobile that Makes Sense.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.850
More and more states are banning cellphone
use while driving - but is it actually effective?

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:17.850
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and since
2008, California has had a ban on all hand-held

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.089
cellphone use while driving.

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:27.179
Previous studies using driving simulators,
have found that people who talk on a cellphone

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:31.640
while driving - are equally as impaired as
people driving while intoxicated. Although

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.239
none of those studies have been conducted
on actual drivers - so it’s possible the

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.140
statistics change when someone gets behind
the wheel.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.079
In any case, a new study from the University
of Colorado Boulder, shows that the ban in

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.850
California has been largely ineffective - and
there’s been no decrease in traffic accidents

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.879
since the law was put into place.

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.350
Researchers looked at the rates of accidents
in California for the 6 months leading up

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.149
to the ban, and compared it to the number
of accidents in the 6-month period after.

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.870
They chose that relatively small window of
time, so they could avoid confounding variables

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.189
that might impact their numbers, like the
introduction of safer cars on the road, or

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.950
the reduction in the number of drivers, due
to things like economic recession and rising

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.970
gas prices. They also accounted for precipitation
levels - which are known to increase accident

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:14.170
rates.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.689
The purpose of the study was to see if the
ban was effective, but the fact that it’s

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.860
not - raises a lot of questions about why
that may be.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.680
According to the author of the study, Dr.
Daniel Kaffine, there are several possible

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.329
reasons. The most obvious one, would be that
people simply aren’t complying with the

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:32.520
law - although similar bans have been enacted
in other states, and they seem to be effective

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.549
there. If this is really the reason, then
logic dictates that increasing the fines associated

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.850
with the ban - at least in California - could
produce better results.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.750
Another possible theory, is that hands-free
devices - which are still allowed under the

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.479
law - could be just as distracting as handheld
cell phones. And there are studies out there

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:50.659
that corroborate that.

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.390
It’s also possible that the type of people
who drive recklessly with cellphones - are

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.009
just prone to distracted driving, no matter
what. So even if they’re not using their

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.340
cell phones - they could be fiddling with
other things, like the radio or a GPS device.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.000
Kaffine says that more research needs to be
done to figure out why the number of traffic

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.160
accidents hasn’t decreased since the ban
was put into place - and that doing so - could

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.120
lead to more effective policies in the future.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.840
I think it’s safe to say that as long as
you’re not using them while driving, cellphones

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.590
are a pretty awesome invention. But you know
what’s not awesome? Paying your monthly

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.110
cellphone bill. It’s expensive, it’s confusing
- So what if there was a better way?

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.480
Well with Ting, there absolutely is. Ting
is a new mobile phone service that puts the

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.459
power back in your hands. There are no plans,
no cancellation fees, and best of all - no

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.530
hidden fees or charges! With Ting, you ONLY
pay for the data you actually use - and you

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.050

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.440
transparent - and 98% of customers who switch
to Ting - actually save money on their monthly

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.280
cell phone bills.

In the meantime, let us know what YOU think
of this study - and if you live in a state

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.110
that’s banned handheld cellphone while driving
- do you still use it? Leave your responses

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.419
in the comments below, and as always - thank
you guys for watching!
