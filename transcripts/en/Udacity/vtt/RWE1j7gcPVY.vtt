So far we added code to put
one event into the data layer,

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:11.160
just used by one trigger, and to trigger
two hits to analytics as a result.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.680
And we did this because I wanted you
to see that a trigger can be used

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.864
to trigger more than one thing, but stop
and think about whether it really makes

00:00:18.864 --> 00:00:23.780
sense to track the opening of
an activity in multiple ways like this.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.370
On the one hand,
we track the button clicks for

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.850
the Show Daily Special button.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.510
But on the other hand, we track
the Show Daily Special screen views.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.000
Really, we should only send one hit,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.410
when the user clicks
the Show Daily Special button.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.030
Which tag do you think is
the right one to use in this case?

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.610
Go ahead and discuss in the forum.
