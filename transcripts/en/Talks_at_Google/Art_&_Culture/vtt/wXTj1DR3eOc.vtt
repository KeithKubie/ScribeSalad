00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.760
JASON: You guys are obviously
playing Detroit tonight,

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.850
the great city of Detroit.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.510
So thank you for spending
some time with us.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.540
I guess since we're on
the topic of the tour,

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.380
maybe we can throw out a
question about the tour.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.770
I guess Joey, I'm
looking at you.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.395
So maybe we'll start at that end
and kind of work our way down.

00:00:22.395 --> 00:00:24.980
So you maybe tell us about
what's going on with the tour?

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.050
You guys have been on
the road for, I think,

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.493
a little over a year now,
touring to promote your latest

00:00:30.493 --> 00:00:32.659
album that came out last
year, "Head Carrier," which

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:34.580
is fantastic.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.440
What's the tour been like?

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.200
And maybe just to take
that a step further,

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.610
how has touring changed?

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.530
What's this tour like
compared to tours

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.270
you guys were doing
in the '80s and '90s,

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.840
besides Paz being here,
and then also tours

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.540
that you did in 2004, 2009?

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.460
What's the dynamic like now?

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.550
JOEY: Good question.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.790
Well, the tour's
been going well.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.810
Everyone's laughing,
doing their own things.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.010
We get together back in the bus
and go, what did you do today?

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.390
And what did you do?

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.200
And what did you do?

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.006
And then we talk
about what we did.

00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:15.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.980
And then the difference
between now and then

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:30.950
was, well, we'd be
in the bus and we'd

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.070
wonder where we were and
we'd have to look at the map

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.110
and then look at
the signs and then

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.040
figure out where we were, are.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.980
We'd have to wake up to do that.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.390
So now we're in our bunk
and we just go on our phone

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.000
and then go back to sleep.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.660
That's the big difference.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.370
JASON: And I'm assuming you
use Google to figure that out.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.650
Is that right?

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.360
CHARLES: I don't
even know what it is.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.350
I just ask it.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.060
We just ask it.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.870
I just ask it where we
are and it tells me.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:07.949
I guess it's Google.

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:09.199
JASON: It's like magic, right?

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:10.383
CHARLES: Is it Google?

00:02:10.383 --> 00:02:11.330
JOEY: It's Google.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.850
JASON: OK, good.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.134
JOEY: It's on default.

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:15.050
JASON: That's perfect.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.580
Good.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.970
That's the proper
answer, thank you.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.192
Fantastic.

00:02:19.192 --> 00:02:20.650
Quick show of hands
with the crowd.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.820
Has anyone here been to
a Pixies show before?

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:26.554
That's great.

00:02:26.554 --> 00:02:27.220
It's not enough.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.636
We'll get a few more of you
there this evening, hopefully.

00:02:29.636 --> 00:02:31.980
For those of you who haven't
been to a Pixies show,

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.480
it's a fantastic experience.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.880
One of my favorite
parts of a Pixies show

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.520
is that there's no set list.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.850
And what I mean by that is
that the band kind of chooses

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.151
on a whim what's being played
next, usually led by Charles,

00:02:47.151 --> 00:02:47.650
I believe.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.210
So Charles, maybe tell us a
little bit about that dynamic

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.270
and how you kind of read or
feel the audience or the band's

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.965
energy and decide, hey,
this is the next song

00:02:57.965 --> 00:02:59.590
that I'm going to
throw out to the band

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.360
and we're going to rock it out.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.276
CHARLES: I don't know.

00:03:02.276 --> 00:03:05.170
I suppose it's just
different all the time.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.360
I'm having random
thought processes.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.340
Like oh, that was a song that
mentioned a caribou in it.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.470
I know, snake.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.480
Caribou, snake, animals.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.880
And I'll go on like some animal.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.400
I'll be like, I've got four
animal songs I just did.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.360
And then monkey, monkey.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.240
And then sometimes
it'll be like,

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.570
oh yeah, that's a good set-up,
because that song sounds

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.340
like it's talking
about this next song.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.502
And it will be some
sort of abstract kind

00:03:35.502 --> 00:03:36.460
of a thought like that.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.940
Or it might be like, oh gee,
they're really not reacting

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.440
to these new songs at all.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.540
We'd better, come on,
let's do the "Here

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.724
Comes Your Man" or something
that's going to perk things

00:03:46.724 --> 00:03:47.390
up a little bit.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.320
So it just depends on whatever
is going on in my head,

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.820
I guess.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.010
Sometimes Dave picks one.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.924
He has a couple drum kind
of nervous energy things

00:03:59.924 --> 00:04:01.840
he'll do that we know
he's getting ready to do

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.590
a certain particular song.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.430
And it'll be like that one.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.352
DAVID: And we cheat sometimes,
because some songs go together.

00:04:08.352 --> 00:04:09.310
That goes hand-in-hand.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.403
That'll happen.

00:04:10.403 --> 00:04:11.249
Visual signs.

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:12.040
JASON: I like that.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.650
Keeps the audience on your
toes, but it keeps the band

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.570
on your toes as well, right?

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.329
I read for this
particular tour, you guys

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.530
rehearsed around 90 songs
that at any given time

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.410
you can just kind of
pull out and play.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.110
Let me direct this
question to you, Paz.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.400
You're the newest
member of the band,

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.700
here for about a year and
a half, two years now.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.500
Can you tell us what
that process was

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.930
like once you joined the band?

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.660
How do you learn 90 songs?

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.420
Since you weren't around when
these songs were originally

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.976
written in the '80s and
'90s, you pull these out.

00:04:45.976 --> 00:04:48.100
Is it a little more difficult
for you to kind of go

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.560
through that process, or has
it been fairly simple for you?

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.476
You've obviously played
music for a long time.

00:04:52.476 --> 00:04:54.310
So what's that
been like for you?

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.560
PAZ: I broke my foot and
I couldn't do anything

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.410
except for listen and play.

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.244
So I was in my room.

00:05:03.244 --> 00:05:04.743
This was four years
ago, by the way.

00:05:04.743 --> 00:05:06.310
I've been in the
band for four years.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:12.010
And yeah, I was in
my bedroom listening,

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.660
because just to listen
to all of the songs

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.420
would take about five
hours just to listen to it.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.390
So imagine oh, I wonder
how the bass part goes.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.470
Then it's another five hours.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.780
So there goes 10 hours.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:34.060
And so yeah, you have to make
sure you're really listening.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.770
JOEY: I have to apologize, Paz.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.380
I was the one that
broke your foot.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.642
PAZ: Yeah, he was like, no,
you're not going anywhere.

00:05:41.642 --> 00:05:42.850
JASON: Is that what kept you?

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.020
Yeah, that's what
got you in the band.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.645
They broke your foot
and made you stay.

00:05:45.645 --> 00:05:46.930
Is that right?

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.434
Paz, for your first kind
of rehearsal with the band,

00:05:49.434 --> 00:05:51.850
is it true that your mom dropped
you off at the rehearsal?

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:52.490
Did I hear that correctly?

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:53.360
PAZ: That's true, yeah.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.160
JASON: I love this story.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:54.970
It's so awesome.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:55.886
It's so rock and roll.

00:05:55.886 --> 00:06:01.650
PAZ: My first rehearsal,
this was before we met up

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.200
with Charles in North Hampton.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.490
We were in California
and my car broke down.

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.840
And I had all my
notes and things.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:19.110
I was like, Mom, can you
drop me off at the studio?

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.027
She was so excited.

00:06:21.027 --> 00:06:22.860
I just knew it would
make her super excited.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.370
She came and picked me
up and dropped me off

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.444
at the rehearsal space in L.A.

00:06:29.444 --> 00:06:30.360
JASON: That's amazing.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.770
Most of us--

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.019
PAZ: And she picked me up too.

00:06:32.019 --> 00:06:33.360
And she's like, how did it go?

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.746
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.752
JASON: Obviously well.

00:06:38.752 --> 00:06:40.710
Most of us get dropped
off at the movie theater

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:41.630
by our parents.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.670
Paz gets dropped off to join
an amazing rock and roll band.

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:48.810
Your story is slightly
better than ours.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.330
David, let me ask you,
on the subject of Paz,

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.740
since we're chatting
with her right now.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.830
Again, the newest
member of the band.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.030
Four years, my apologies.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.120
I cut it a little short, so
I didn't mean to do that.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.550
Can you talk a little bit
about the dynamic of the band

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.785
and how it's changed
since Paz has joined?

00:07:04.785 --> 00:07:05.910
Obviously she fits in well.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:07.320
I'm watching you
guys play for us

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.791
and the dynamic is fantastic.

00:07:08.791 --> 00:07:10.290
Can you talk a
little bit about what

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:12.134
that's been like to
have her join the group?

00:07:12.134 --> 00:07:13.300
DAVID: Well, it's wonderful.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.591
Well, she's made me play
better, because she's so good,

00:07:15.591 --> 00:07:17.050
I don't want to be embarrassed.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.510
I had to step up my game.

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:20.770
But yeah, it's fantastic.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:21.840
She's a joy to be around.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.269
She plays well.

00:07:23.269 --> 00:07:24.810
And like I've always
said, it's funny

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:27.702
because she's been
with us for four years.

00:07:27.702 --> 00:07:29.160
She still feels
like the new woman,

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.232
so the men are all still
behaving very well.

00:07:32.232 --> 00:07:33.440
JASON: On your best behavior.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.430
DAVID: Yes.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:38.830
JASON: And too, you're the third
female bassist for the band

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:39.330
as well.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.430
It's kind of part of
the DNA of the band,

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.970
I suppose, to have a strong
female bassist in there

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:46.920
as well, which is fantastic.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.530
Let's get back to the new--

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:50.940
I call it the new album.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.080
I guess it's still
new, a year old.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.910
The newest album, I
suppose, "Head Carrier"

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.550
Charles, maybe for
you, you came out

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:03.600
with an album a few years
ago, which you kind of

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.120
considered more, I think I read
in an article, a little bit

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.670
more of a transitional
album, where this is kind

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:12.145
of your return to the
Pixies, this newest

00:08:12.145 --> 00:08:13.020
album "Head Carrier."

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.027
Can you kind of
talk about why you

00:08:15.027 --> 00:08:16.860
feel this album is
different than the albums

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.235
that you've released
in the past,

00:08:18.235 --> 00:08:20.790
or maybe quite similar to some
of the original four albums

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:21.692
that you released?

00:08:21.692 --> 00:08:23.650
CHARLES: I guess because
we have a bass player.

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:27.690
In the previous record, we
lost our original bassist

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:30.450
during the session.

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:34.010
Anyway, so we had
a friend of ours

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:37.320
named Ding came to the
session, and he played the bass

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.596
for the rest of the session.

00:08:38.596 --> 00:08:40.679
So we worked it out, but
it was still a little bit

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:43.589
like, there was this
kind of vacant chair.

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:57.090
We had booked the studio, and
we were with our old producer

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:00.040
friend, and we were there.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:03.530
We were in this little
village in Wales.

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:06.510
And it was like, well, we
got to make the record,

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.470
because we've got these
songs and we got this,

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:10.172
we're in Wales.

00:09:10.172 --> 00:09:11.130
We don't want to leave.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:12.780
We just got here.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:14.340
So we just did it.

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.590
So it came out the
way it came out.

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:20.350
And we got through it.

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:21.870
So yeah, I guess
it was transitional

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:28.380
because we had this sort of,
we were missing a fourth member

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.730
for that kind of dynamic.

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:37.810
And so fortunately for
this last session, we did.

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:38.740
We were like a unit.

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:47.790
So we're making the coffee
together, hanging out.

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:51.255
And it was communal
and it was a band.

00:09:51.255 --> 00:09:52.380
JASON: It felt good, right.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.210
Yeah, absolutely.

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:55.760
Well, the album is fantastic.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.140
Has the songwriting
process changed at all?

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.590
You've got the feeling
of a band again.

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:01.640
You've got a great feel.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.860
You guys have a great chemistry.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:07.190
Has the process, either
of writing the music

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.609
itself, the genesis of
the song or the lyrics,

00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:11.150
has that changed at
all for you guys,

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:12.410
or is it still fairly similar?

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:16.580
Does it kind of remain
similar from the '80s

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:20.142
when you first started writing
and producing music to now?

00:10:20.142 --> 00:10:21.600
CHARLES: I guess
it feels the same.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.820
I mean, you've got
microphones and tape

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.440
recorders and instruments.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:32.000
You try to do something that
feels interesting or fun

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.170
or something to play.

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:36.392
And you just, well, we'll
try this one and see how.

00:10:36.392 --> 00:10:38.225
Sometimes it comes back
through the speakers

00:10:38.225 --> 00:10:40.349
and it's like, wow, I didn't
know it was that good.

00:10:40.349 --> 00:10:45.049
And other times it's sort of
like, uh, it's not so good.

00:10:45.049 --> 00:10:45.590
I don't know.

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:49.040
Every song is different.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:54.230
I think I read an interview
years ago with Beck.

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:57.100
I think he was saying that every
song is like a little country

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.040
and it has its own
rules and customs.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.460
And I totally understand that.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:04.170
So when you start to write a
song, it's like, oh, it's this.

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:07.880
This is the song, even if
it's not fully matriculated.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.640
You know what I mean?

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.920
You kind of have a
sense of, oh, that

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.620
follows the customs
of the country.

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.203
And then other times
you try something

00:11:16.203 --> 00:11:19.450
and it's like, that
doesn't fit this country.

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:23.140
They wouldn't do that there.

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:26.970
So it's just kind of, I
don't know, that's how it is.

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:28.440
JASON: And it works, right?

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.131
CHARLES: Yeah, I hope so.

00:11:31.131 --> 00:11:32.630
JASON: You're still
selling tickets,

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:35.280
so I think it's still working.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:39.050
Joey, let me ask you, speaking
of composition, so you've

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:42.330
done some really cool work
outside of the band as well,

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:46.790
composing commercials, composing
movie and TV soundtracks,

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:47.810
things like that.

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:49.850
How does that process,
does it differ

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:52.410
from what Charles was
just mentioning, where

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:53.660
it's got a certain feel to it?

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.970
Or does that feel completely
different than the type

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:59.680
of music that you're producing
and creating with the Pixies?

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:09.710
JOEY: It get very lonely just
by myself working all the time.

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:11.330
Yeah, of course it
feels different.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.940
It's everyone's project.

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:15.596
It's their pet.

00:12:15.596 --> 00:12:17.910
It's the last piece
of the puzzle.

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:26.152
So I'm their slave?

00:12:26.152 --> 00:12:27.300
[LAUGHS]

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.470
No.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:29.850
It's a fun process.

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:33.180
It's amazing.

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:37.770
My son, I was doing
a horror movie

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:39.780
and I had him push a button.

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:43.740
Well, a key, like
an ominous sound.

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:47.340
And I go, when he walks
through that door, push it.

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:51.140
And when he exits, take it out.

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:52.080
I gave him $5.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.445
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:56.070
JASON: That's pretty cool.

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:58.840
And Paz, you helped out
with some of this as well.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:02.500
If you guys haven't
seen, a quick plug.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.670
Joey and Paz did a really
cool, I think it was Acura,

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:06.510
am I right?

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:09.526
An Acura commercial
maybe a year or two ago.

00:13:09.526 --> 00:13:10.900
And I might be
wrong on that too.

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.191
But if you guys haven't seen
it, look it up on YouTube.

00:13:13.191 --> 00:13:15.570
It's actually one of
the coolest commercials.

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:17.778
So you were able to kind of
work out on that as well,

00:13:17.778 --> 00:13:20.480
so expanding outside of the band
as well, which is fantastic.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.300
It's very cool.

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.147
What was that
process like for you?

00:13:23.147 --> 00:13:25.230
You're classically trained,
I know, as a musician.

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:27.240
Was that kind of fun to be
able to flex that a little bit?

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.531
PAZ: That was really fun, yeah.

00:13:28.531 --> 00:13:31.290
I played piano and the
violin and I got my sister

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:35.040
to play the cello on there.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.680
Just trying different
arrangements

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.760
of "Where's My Mind."

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.811
Yeah, it was really fun.

00:13:40.811 --> 00:13:41.310
JASON: Yeah.

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:43.351
Well, hopefully we can
pump up some YouTube views

00:13:43.351 --> 00:13:45.000
on that commercial.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:45.600
It's on there.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.671
I watched it recently.

00:13:47.671 --> 00:13:49.170
Let me talk a little
bit, so I guess

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:50.461
we're talking about technology.

00:13:50.461 --> 00:13:54.570
And we are at Google, which
is a technology company.

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:56.250
So usually when we
have bands in here,

00:13:56.250 --> 00:14:00.540
we like to ask a question
around how you guys feel

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.270
about the utilization
of technology

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:06.030
with what you guys do, whether
it's connectivity with fans,

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:09.960
whether it's selling tickets,
whether it's social media

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.080
and staying in touch
with family members.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.700
And you guys too,
I think you guys

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:19.410
were I guess early quote,
unquote, "pioneers"

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:22.170
in terms of your interaction
with digital media.

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:25.260
You guys released a lot of
music on it was called eMusic.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.750
You guys were very
early to iTunes.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.310
So I feel like,
like it or not, you

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:32.340
guys also embrace some of
the digital movement of music

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:32.840
as well.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.700
So that's all encompassing
technology in general.

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.380
But would just kind
of love to hear

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:40.570
how you guys feel about
technology and music,

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:42.390
whether it's been
good or bad and how

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:45.330
that's worked for you guys.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.040
CHARLES: We had a
meeting this morning

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.998
on the bus on the way
over here about the songs

00:14:48.998 --> 00:14:50.010
we were going to play.

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:55.230
But also we discussed, I
guess we're a little behind.

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:57.450
We told Simon, our
tour manager, that we

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:00.480
wanted one of those
speakers that you just

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.923
shout out and tell it
what music to play.

00:15:02.923 --> 00:15:05.550
There's Alexa, right?

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:06.900
That's the one my brother has.

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.557
JASON: I've never
heard of that one.

00:15:08.557 --> 00:15:09.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:13.560
There's one called
Google Home, though.

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.311
I've heard it's quite fantastic.

00:15:15.311 --> 00:15:16.560
CHARLES: Maybe get a free one.

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:17.060
Maybe.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:18.530
I don't know.

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:19.230
Google Home.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:21.510
We don't care, as long as
it plays the damn Chet Baker

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:23.176
record or whatever
we want to listen to.

00:15:23.176 --> 00:15:25.530
You know what I mean?

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:28.350
So yeah, we like the tech.

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:30.870
JASON: Any other thoughts
from anyone else?

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:32.960
JOEY: Technology is good.

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.890
DAVID: One difference
from then and now

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:38.609
is now there's Jumbo-trons
when you do live shows.

00:15:38.609 --> 00:15:39.900
There weren't them in the past.

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:41.840
So now you've got
to like, oh no.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.650
JASON: You can see
yourself performing.

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:45.830
DAVID: Technology in that way.

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:47.080
JASON: What's next?

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.400
So you guys are, again,
a year out on the release

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.150
of "Head Carrier."

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:52.441
You guys are obviously touring.

00:15:52.441 --> 00:15:57.270
I know you have a lot more
stops on this particular tour.

00:15:57.270 --> 00:16:01.200
Any writing for the next album?

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.150
Any thoughts of
what's coming up next?

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:06.180
I know you have
a big anniversary

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:11.610
coming up next year for
"Surfer Rosa," which

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:13.224
is I believe 20 years old?

00:16:13.224 --> 00:16:13.890
Or 30 years old.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:15.889
CHARLES: We're going to
retake our "Surfer Rosa"

00:16:15.889 --> 00:16:20.000
vows at the shows
together as a band.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.720
JASON: A re-commitment.

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.074
CHARLES: Yeah.

00:16:24.074 --> 00:16:27.410
I gotta start writing
them now [INAUDIBLE]..

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:30.071
JASON: Anniversary tour
for that, as you guys

00:16:30.071 --> 00:16:30.945
did with "Doolittle?"

00:16:30.945 --> 00:16:34.260
Are you guys going to
work on some new music?

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.990
CHARLES: We got a jam session
scheduled tomorrow night.

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:39.760
Tomorrow afternoon.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.750
Well, in Grand Rapids.

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:47.020
We jam out about
three times a week

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:50.200
during the day at
wherever we're playing.

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.750
Not every day, but about.

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:55.500
So the last jam we
had was in Cleveland?

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.890
No, Toronto.

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:00.420
Anyway, we're overdue
for a little jam

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:05.319
where we play new chord
shapes and that kind of thing.

00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:08.550
So yeah, we have begun
working on new songs

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:13.782
and we'll be jamming
them tomorrow.

00:17:13.782 --> 00:17:14.490
JASON: I love it.

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:15.270
See what sticks.

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.770
I love it.

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:16.597
Fantastic.

00:17:16.597 --> 00:17:18.180
I've got one more
question, then we'll

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:21.589
open it up for maybe one
or two audience questions.

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:23.130
If you've got a
question, think of it

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:26.890
and we'll get you a mic
here in just a second.

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:29.239
This is what I consider
a fun question,

00:17:29.239 --> 00:17:30.280
and it's for each of you.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.650
So we'll go down the row.

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:34.680
So a lot of times when
somebody is new to Google,

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:40.350
we will ask them what their
guilty pleasure music is.

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:44.382
Essentially what I mean by that
is, if I pulled up next to you

00:17:44.382 --> 00:17:45.840
and you were sitting
at a stoplight

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.570
and your window was down and
you were just jamming out

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:51.540
to a particular song
or musician but maybe

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:54.850
were a little embarrassed that
that's who you're listening to,

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:56.380
who would that be?

00:17:56.380 --> 00:18:01.690
Maybe like Justin
Bieber, Britney Spears,

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:02.980
something like that.

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:04.330
Anything that you guys have?

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:08.140
JOEY: Leo Sayer, "You Make
Me Feel Like Dancing."

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.770
JASON: Singing along?

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:11.050
You sing along to it?

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:12.122
Top of the lungs?

00:18:12.122 --> 00:18:13.330
JOEY: It just makes me happy.

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:13.870
JASON: Yeah?

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:15.140
I love it.

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:17.066
Charles, you got on?

00:18:17.066 --> 00:18:19.720
CHARLES: I don't know if I
have a funny one or anything.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.820
JASON: It doesn't
have to be funny.

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.290
CHARLES: I don't
have a Leo Sayer.

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:35.480
Lately I've been
listening to this guy.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.170
Hector Lavoe.

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:41.060
He's a Puerto
Rican salsa singer.

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:43.580
He's passed away now, but
he made a lot of records

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:47.180
with Willie Colon, who
was a New York trombone.

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:53.450
They'd make these, in the
'60s, early '70s, records.

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:58.040
But that's what I've
been when I want peppy.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.250
JASON: I love it.

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:00.650
David?

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:02.720
DAVID: Well, it's tough.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.020
I don't think it's, what do
you call it, a guilty pleasure,

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:09.670
but Steely Dan and Rush.

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:11.540
JASON: Classics.

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.320
Those are inspirations
too, right?

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.040
That's fantastic.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.610
Paz, what about you?

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:19.660
PAZ: I guess I
would be embarrassed

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:22.080
to my interpretation
of Edith Piaf,

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.819
pretending that I
know what I'm singing.

00:19:25.819 --> 00:19:28.360
JASON: Just making noise that
sounds good along to the music.

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:29.360
PAZ: That sounds French.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.800
Kind of French-like.

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:35.970
JASON: I was really
hoping that one of you

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:37.876
would say you listen to
the Pixies in the car

00:19:37.876 --> 00:19:39.000
while you guys are driving.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.130
PAZ: I definitely
have done that.

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:41.500
I definitely have done that.

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:42.930
JASON: Just jamming
out to your own music.

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:44.730
I would just die if I
pulled up next to one of you

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:46.229
and you were singing
your own music.

00:19:46.229 --> 00:19:48.570
I've always dreamt of that.

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:51.330
PAZ: I don't know,
a good way to see

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:54.120
how your record sounds
is putting it in your car

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.850
and going for a drive.

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:58.690
If it drives well,
it sounds good.

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:00.292
JASON: I love it.

00:20:00.292 --> 00:20:02.250
That's what we listen to
most of our music too.

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:03.165
Very cool.

00:20:03.165 --> 00:20:07.560
JOEY: I feel like I opened up
my soul with saying Leo Sayer.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:08.940
JASON: You led off strong.

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.109
I like that.

00:20:10.109 --> 00:20:10.900
It's out there now.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.275
It's going to be
on the internet.

00:20:12.275 --> 00:20:13.554
You can't take it back.

00:20:13.554 --> 00:20:14.940
CHARLES: No way.

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.788
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:21.664
It's all about the
perks, Simon, the perks.

00:20:21.664 --> 00:20:24.130
Look at that.

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:27.620
JOEY: Three more, please.

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:31.560
CHARLES: Leo Sayer, before
we go on, Joe, tonight.

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.450
Going to get happy.

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:34.710
JOEY: I wouldn't mind my own.

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:38.580
JASON: I like that.

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:39.900
CHARLES: Thank you very much.

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:40.920
JASON: Thank you, guys.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.253
Any questions from the audience?

00:20:42.253 --> 00:20:44.617
Anyone want to
shout one out here?

00:20:44.617 --> 00:20:46.700
AUDIENCE: I guess I'd
direct this towards Charles,

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:49.580
going back in the
beginning days.

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:51.520
What was the transition,
in other words,

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:55.260
from playing music,
doing covers, and making

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:57.960
that transition going
to original music?

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.320
Could you tell us a little
bit about how that happened

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.356
versus slugging it
out in the nightclubs?

00:21:03.356 --> 00:21:04.980
CHARLES: Well, we
played in nightclubs,

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:08.190
but we were playing in, I
don't know what you call it,

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:12.210
a musical culture where you
didn't really do cover songs.

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:14.970
If you do cover songs, you play
at a certain kind of a club.

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:17.004
But the kind of clubs
that we were playing at,

00:21:17.004 --> 00:21:18.420
that would have
been frowned upon.

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:20.459
You wouldn't have been
even allowed a slot.

00:21:20.459 --> 00:21:22.500
It doesn't matter what
kind of a racket you make,

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.240
it has to be your
racket or whatever.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:29.640
So we've learned over the
years a couple of songs,

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.590
but I personally find
it very challenging

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:35.430
to learn other people's music,
even if it's a simple song,

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:37.890
because it's confusing to me.

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:38.880
I don't know.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.920
So we don't do a lot of covers.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.950
We never did when we
were starting out.

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:46.290
But that's just
because we were playing

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:50.880
in Boston and those
clubs there, it

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.290
wasn't about
playing cover music.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:54.180
So I'm glad I didn't have to.

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:56.190
Some people, they
might live in the town

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:58.350
where that might be
the transition that you

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:00.810
have to kind of go
through to, I don't know,

00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:03.300
get to that next stop.

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:05.340
But we didn't have to do that.

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:11.630
I don't know what we
would have played.

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:12.860
Trying to think.

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:14.210
I don't know.

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:14.835
Probably like--

00:22:14.835 --> 00:22:15.584
JASON: Steely Dan?

00:22:15.584 --> 00:22:17.360
CHARLES: The Cars,
probably, or something.

00:22:19.735 --> 00:22:21.610
JASON: Any other questions
from the audience?

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:23.004
Sure.

00:22:23.004 --> 00:22:24.920
AUDIENCE: Any one of you
guys can answer this.

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.747
I was wondering if there's
any bands that you guys would

00:22:27.747 --> 00:22:29.330
like to play with
that you haven't had

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:30.680
the chance to play with yet?

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.570
Like go on tour,
maybe, or something.

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:36.175
DAVID: Steely Dan and Rush.

00:22:36.175 --> 00:22:38.155
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:46.980
CHARLES: That would be good.

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:47.640
JOEY: Leo.

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.820
And oh my god.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:52.040
That would blow a lid on people.

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:52.907
JASON: I love it.

00:22:52.907 --> 00:22:53.740
CHARLES: Edith Piaf.

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.742
JASON: Themes going on.

00:22:55.742 --> 00:22:56.686
PAZ: She's dead.

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:05.150
CHARLES: Some years ago we
played a few shows with Weezer.

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:07.010
And there's something
about that band

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:10.620
that they're kind of more
pop-oriented than we are,

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:14.870
but there's some kind of
aesthetic that they have

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:17.360
which I think that all of
us in the band, we like it

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.140
or whatever.

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:20.950
JOEY: That would
be an amazing tour.

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:22.700
JASON: I would buy a
ticket for that show.

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:24.700
Weezer and the Pixies.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.010
See if we can make that happen.

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:28.791
That would be fantastic.

00:23:28.791 --> 00:23:30.665
AUDIENCE: I have a
question and somewhat also

00:23:30.665 --> 00:23:31.980
an embarrassing story.

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:33.605
But I'll start with
the question first.

00:23:33.605 --> 00:23:37.096
Hopefully well run out of time
before the embarrassing story.

00:23:37.096 --> 00:23:40.500
I feel like with musicians
they have a unique relationship

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:41.270
with music itself.

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:43.970
So there's sort of like a
relationship with a person.

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:45.893
There's love, sometimes
it's difficult,

00:23:45.893 --> 00:23:49.200
it can be hard
writing and performing

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.190
and things like that.

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:52.010
Have you ever had a
moment in your career

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:54.180
when you've maybe fallen
out of love with music

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:56.247
or writing it or doing
it, performing, even

00:23:56.247 --> 00:23:57.110
listening to it?

00:23:57.110 --> 00:24:00.632
And if that has happened,
what's the one thing

00:24:00.632 --> 00:24:02.276
that sort of brought you back?

00:24:02.276 --> 00:24:04.025
Whether it was like,
maybe you had a child

00:24:04.025 --> 00:24:07.720
or maybe, I don't know,
you just listened to a band

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:10.460
and it just sort of brought
you back into things?

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:12.740
JASON: As you can see, we
like multi-part questions

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:14.330
here at Google.

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:15.864
It's hard to follow
along sometimes.

00:24:15.864 --> 00:24:17.030
But I think we got that one.

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:18.200
Thanks, Eric.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.470
DAVID: Well, I can say when the
band, when we dissolved a while

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:25.000
back, I kind of gave up drums.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.710
This was great,
playing with this.

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:28.700
And I did some
session work, nah.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:29.750
Gave up drums.

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:32.042
Didn't think about it for,
I don't know, 10 years.

00:24:32.042 --> 00:24:33.500
But then when we
got back together,

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:35.000
it was like, whoa,
what have I done?

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.567
It's was like a lost love.

00:24:37.567 --> 00:24:39.400
JASON: And for those
of you that don't know,

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.947
David also became a professional
musician during that time.

00:24:42.947 --> 00:24:43.530
PAZ: Magician.

00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:44.535
JASON: Magician.

00:24:44.535 --> 00:24:46.910
DAVID: It's only a couple of
letters off my business card

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:48.390
if I change.

00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:50.520
JASON: Magician.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:53.330
So if you haven't, another
YouTube task for you

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:55.340
afterwards is to look
up some of his shows.

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:57.380
They're fantastic.

00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:00.650
CHARLES: One of
my kids, she likes

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:04.945
kind of macho dude singers.

00:25:04.945 --> 00:25:05.820
You know what I mean?

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:07.736
I figured that out when
she was pretty young.

00:25:07.736 --> 00:25:09.360
That's what she kind
of resonates with.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:13.840
So I'm always like, you got
to check out Three Dog Night.

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:18.060
And then she'll then be Three
Dog Night for about a month.

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:22.350
And then, you gotta
check out Cat Stevens.

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:25.290
So it's kind of like I get
to relive a lot of records

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:26.760
I listened to when I was a kid.

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.400
When you have kids, you kind
of go, hey, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.561
Unless they're kind
of like, you know,

00:25:31.561 --> 00:25:33.060
if they're that age
where they don't

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:35.970
want to have anything to do
with you, then you can't really.

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:38.980
But she's in this sweet spot
right now where it's like,

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.720
hey, I got a suggestion
for you, and then

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.780
she'll just totally
take it and run.

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:47.250
So that's been nice to listen
to a lot of records that way

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:49.170
that I haven't listened
to in a long time.

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:51.086
AUDIENCE: How long did
you wait before you let

00:25:51.086 --> 00:25:52.544
her put a needle on a record?

00:25:52.544 --> 00:25:54.027
At what age?

00:25:54.027 --> 00:25:55.110
CHARLES: Oh, I don't know.

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:56.160
We're not real, I don't know.

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:58.035
We've got a lot of broken
stuff in our house.

00:25:58.035 --> 00:26:00.770
We're not really that precious
about that kind of stuff.

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:04.460
JASON: Cool.

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:06.860
Maybe one more question?

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.108
Leah?

00:26:09.108 --> 00:26:11.786
AUDIENCE: So your
lyrics, I know you

00:26:11.786 --> 00:26:13.734
said you just put
together what sounds good

00:26:13.734 --> 00:26:14.952
when you write your songs.

00:26:14.952 --> 00:26:17.549
But are there ever a
deeper meaning behind some

00:26:17.549 --> 00:26:18.848
of the lyrics you write?

00:26:18.848 --> 00:26:21.770
Because they don't
always make sense to me.

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:23.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:24.890
CHARLES: Yeah.

00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:27.560
Sorry, sometimes there is.

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:30.340
And sometimes there is
when you're doing it,

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:34.210
when you're kind of writing.

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:36.112
It's kind of
internalized process.

00:26:36.112 --> 00:26:37.570
It's kind of mental
and you're kind

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:40.360
of jumping all over the place
and you're kind of, oh yeah,

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:44.200
the dots are all connecting
now, they're all connecting now.

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:47.020
And then it's over and
then a year later it's

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:50.890
like, I don't even
know what it's about.

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:53.560
I can't recreate whatever
was going on in my head

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:54.770
at that time.

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:59.279
So it's just like, yeah, it
just kind of sounds the way--

00:26:59.279 --> 00:27:01.570
They're not all like that,
but that's how it is for me.

00:27:04.434 --> 00:27:05.350
JASON: That's amazing.

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:06.290
Thank you guys.

00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:08.110
Guys, one more time,
let's give a round

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:09.516
of applause for that Pixies.

00:27:09.516 --> 00:27:11.140
Thank you so much,
guys, for coming in.

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:12.340
Really appreciate it.

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:14.790
[APPLAUSE]
