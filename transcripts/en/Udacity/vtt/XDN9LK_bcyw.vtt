00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.480
So thus far, we've been able to record our sound, and

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.480
then print the name of the file where we actually recorded our voice.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.310
At this point,

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.280
I want us to consider two scenarios that can cause some trouble going forward.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.239
The first one has to do with our story board, so let me go back to Xcode.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:19.630
Now we know that we are recording our voice in here in the first scene, or

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.330
in Record Sounds View Controller.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.070
We also know that we need that recorded file in here,

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.150
in the second scene, or in Play Sounds View Controller.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.640
Right now, when we hit this Stop button,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.688
we move very promptly form this first scene, to the second scene.

00:00:33.688 --> 00:00:36.640
Do you think we will need to pass the audio file from

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.630
the first scene to the second scene?

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.840
If so, how would we go about doing that?

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.480
So here is the first scenario that we need to think deeply about.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.670
The second scenario has to do with recording audio.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.840
Right now the sounds that we are recording, are really short.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.900
About five to ten seconds long.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.040
What do you think will happen if our user records a conversation with

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.210
a friend for about five minutes?

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.130
I would imagine that it will take our phone some time to process that

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.380
audio properly.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.800
Now picture this.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.550
Our phone is in the middle of processing a really large sound file here in

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:07.207
the first scene,

00:01:07.207 --> 00:01:11.710
while we have pushed the stop button and moved on to the second scene, and

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.790
already started to play the audio that hasn't fully finished recording yet.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.360
That could cause some troubles.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.568
So then the question is,

00:01:18.568 --> 00:01:21.962
how will we know that the phone has successfully finished recording in

00:01:21.962 --> 00:01:25.084
the first scene, before we play that audio in the second scene?

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:28.113
Now, I want you to think about both of these scenarios, and

00:01:28.113 --> 00:01:30.657
then write down your reflections in these boxes,

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:33.460
on how you would go about solving both of these issues.
