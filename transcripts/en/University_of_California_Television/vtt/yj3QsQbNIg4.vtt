00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.810
- [Announcer] This program is presented by

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.894
University of California Television.

00:00:04.894 --> 00:00:06.320

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.583
to keep up with the latest UCTV programs.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.290
(gentle thoughtful music)

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.540
- Good afternoon, I'm Andrew Garrett,

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.970
the Chair of the Linguistics Department

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.380
here at UC Berkeley.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.083
And I'm happy to welcome you to the second

00:01:00.083 --> 00:01:04.482
Charles M. and Martha Hitchock
Lecture by Steven Pinker.

00:01:04.482 --> 00:01:06.860
We saw in yesterday's lecture,

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.510
and anyone who's read Steve's books knows

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.230
that he has the rare ability

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.951
to make the most complex
set of ideas understandable,

00:01:13.951 --> 00:01:16.482
the most challenging problems, tractable.

00:01:16.482 --> 00:01:18.660
He also has a talent for finding

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.822
and clearly showing the
most vivid examples.

00:01:20.822 --> 00:01:25.491
This is an especially valuable
skill for linguists like me.

00:01:25.491 --> 00:01:29.100
We spend our days playing
in the glorious sandbox

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.367
of human language.

00:01:30.367 --> 00:01:33.442
Our little shovels are
digital recording machines.

00:01:33.442 --> 00:01:36.960
Our buckets are scholarly
articles and monographs.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.574
And a lot of us are scared
of climbing out of the sand.

00:01:39.574 --> 00:01:43.739
Steve comes with a broad sense
of the whole human playground

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:46.170
and is smart enough to
tell us how the lovely

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.467
grains of sand matter.

00:01:48.467 --> 00:01:51.600
In each area of linguistic
science where has ventured,

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.740
therefore, I see a line running straight

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.920
from the most interesting
details of language

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.300
to very big questions about the mind.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.170
For example, about 25 years ago,

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.660
Steve's first work that I happened to read

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.522
explored how individual
idiosyncrasies of usage

00:02:05.522 --> 00:02:07.403
in real sentences like:

00:02:07.403 --> 00:02:10.060
That experience grew me up in a hurry.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.822
Or General Alexander Haig's,
"Let me caveat that."

00:02:12.822 --> 00:02:16.310
cast important light on
the cognitive underpinnings

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.330
of language as used even by those

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.093
who are less louche linguistically.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.690
The actual patterns of
idiosyncrasy, Steve argued,

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.330
support a highly structured model

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.570
of human linguistic cognition.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.190
This has been a theme of Steve's work

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.790
showing that evidence
from both natural usage

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.108
and controlled experiments.

00:02:33.108 --> 00:02:36.880
And he designs very created
psycholinguistic studies,

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.270
shows how intricately
structured what he has called

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.153
the human language instinct must be.

00:02:41.153 --> 00:02:45.070
People who aren't language
geeks might be startled

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.770
by the number of papers in our field

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.571
trying to explain exactly why,

00:02:48.571 --> 00:02:52.440
even though the past
tense of sink is sank,

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.640
we say things like, "I synced my iPod."

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.840
Not, "I sank my iPod."

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.070
But the implications turn
out to be really significant,

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.160
helping us see whether
linguistic cognition

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.910
is associative or symbolic.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.870
In this important debate, Steve has been

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.633
among the major participants
over several decades.

00:03:09.633 --> 00:03:12.120
Of course, the nature
of the language faculty

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.450
raises questions of an
evolutionary nature.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.140
If there is a language
extinct, did it evolve?

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.580
And if it evolved, how could that happen?

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.270
Steve is one of the two or three

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.700
leading participants
in that debate as well,

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.390
stressing, again, the significance

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.870
of what he entertainingly calls

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.450
the raffish idiosyncrasies
and seemingly peripheral,

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.816
but actually omnipresent,
features of human language.

00:03:33.816 --> 00:03:36.810
Today we'll hear about
one of the newest strands

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.450
of Steve's research on
indirect speech acts,

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.080
a great topic for a Berkeley crowd

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.860
as I expect he'll explain.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.440
I'd say more, but a
nod's as good as a wink

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.446
to a blind bat, if you know what I mean.

00:03:47.446 --> 00:03:49.100
(audience laughing)

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.390
For the Elephant in the Room,

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.020
The Psychology of Innuendo and Euphemism,

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.488
please join me in welcoming
Professor Steven Pinker.

00:03:55.488 --> 00:03:58.655
(audience applauding)

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.477
Thanks very much.

00:04:05.634 --> 00:04:08.100
- Thank you very much, Andrew,

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.700
for that very kind introduction.

00:04:10.941 --> 00:04:14.340
Why don't people just say what they mean?

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.466
Why do people sidestep, shilly-shally,

00:04:17.466 --> 00:04:19.022
beat around the bush,

00:04:19.022 --> 00:04:22.964
veil their intentions
in innuendo, euphemism,

00:04:22.964 --> 00:04:26.710
double speak, and other
forms of verbal fig leaves,

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.083
counting on the reader
to catch their drift,

00:04:29.083 --> 00:04:33.010
read between the lines
and connect the dots.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.780
Let me give you some
examples of this phenomenon

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.155
of indirect speech.

00:04:38.155 --> 00:04:40.410
Any of you who remember one of the

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.033
opening scenes of the movie Fargo

00:04:42.033 --> 00:04:45.225
will recall that at one critical juncture

00:04:45.225 --> 00:04:48.090
a pair of kidnappers with a hostage

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.720
tied up in the back seat of the car

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.650
is pulled over by a police officer

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.664
because the car is missing its plates.

00:04:53.664 --> 00:04:57.070
The officer demands that
the driver hand over

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.320
his drivers license.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.640
He proffers his wallet with
the driver's license showing

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.680
and a $50 bill extending ever so slightly.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.617
And he says to the officer,
"I was thinking that maybe

00:05:07.617 --> 00:05:09.307
"the best thing would
be to take care of it

00:05:09.307 --> 00:05:10.830
"here in Brainerd."

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.890
which, of course, everyone
recognizes as a veiled bribe.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.680
Another example of veiled bribe

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.970
can be seen in this New
Yorker cartoon in which

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.777
the driver says to the
officer, "What Hershey bar?

00:05:21.777 --> 00:05:23.457
"I didn't see any Hershey bar."

00:05:24.985 --> 00:05:28.097
Polite requests, "If you
could pass the guacamole,

00:05:28.097 --> 00:05:30.110
"that would be awesome."

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.740
If you think about it, that sentence

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.880
does not make a whole lot of sense.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.257
But somehow it sounds
a whole lot nicer than

00:05:37.257 --> 00:05:39.498
"Give me the damn guacamole."

00:05:39.498 --> 00:05:40.730
(audience laughing)

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.227
Any of you who have been

00:05:42.227 --> 00:05:45.300
at a university fundraising event

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.170
are familiar with euphemistic schnoring,

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:49.647
such as, "We're counting on you

00:05:49.647 --> 00:05:53.240
"to show leadership in our
campaign for the future."

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.177
Rather than, "You've got a lot of money,

00:05:55.177 --> 00:05:57.277
"how about giving some of it to Berkeley?"

00:05:59.007 --> 00:06:02.293
"Would you like to come
up and see my etchings?"

00:06:02.293 --> 00:06:06.810
That has been recognized as
a sexual come on for so long

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.410
that in the 1930s, James Thurber

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.960
drew a cartoon in which a confused man

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.687
says to his date, "You wait here

00:06:13.687 --> 00:06:15.493
"and I'll bring the etchings down."

00:06:15.493 --> 00:06:18.493
(audience laughing)

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:23.050
And then fans of the
Sopranos might recognize

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.897
dialogue such as the following:

00:06:24.897 --> 00:06:27.817
"I hear you're the jury
foreman in the Soprano trial.

00:06:27.817 --> 00:06:29.650
"It's an important civic responsibility.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.903
"You've got a wife and kids.

00:06:31.903 --> 00:06:34.492
"We know you'll do the right thing."

00:06:34.492 --> 00:06:35.325
(audience laughing)
Which, of course,

00:06:35.325 --> 00:06:38.008
we all recognize as a veiled threat.

00:06:38.008 --> 00:06:41.160
So the puzzle is why is bribes, requests,

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.730
seductions, solicitations and threats

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.540
so often veiled when
presumably both parties

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.355
know what they mean?

00:06:48.355 --> 00:06:51.500
This is a topic that's in the general area

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.500
of a subfield of linguistics
called discourse or pragmatics.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.190
And Andrew made reference to
the familiarity of that topic

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:02.840
here at Berkeley, in large part

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.880
because the pioneer of
this field was Paul Grice,

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.560
who proposed a overarching
principle called

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.780
the cooperative principle,

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.370
namely that the speaker
and hearer cooperate

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:17.241
to advance the conversation.

00:07:17.241 --> 00:07:20.908
Penelope Brown and Stephen
Levinson extended Grice's ideas

00:07:20.908 --> 00:07:24.360
in their politeness theory,
according to which the speaker

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.220
and hearer cooperate not
just to advance the message

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.620
but to maintain a nebulous
quality called face,

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.697
as in saving face and losing face.

00:07:33.697 --> 00:07:36.740
My former colleague at
Stanford, Herb Clark,

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:40.570
in using language, proposes
that this phenomenon

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:43.300
falls under a phenomenon
that he calls joint action.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.520
Language use is really
a form of joint action.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.560
A joint action is one that is carried out

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.110
by an ensemble of people acting

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:50.860
in coordination with each other.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.280
As simple example, think
of two people waltzing,

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.893
paddling a canoe, playing a
piano duet, or making love.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.180
Well, all of these insights, I think,

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.990
help us understand
components of the phenomenon

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:04.230
of indirect speech.

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:06.960
But what they leave is why there should be

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.020
such a phenomenon in the first place.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:13.075
If conversation was really a matter of

00:08:13.075 --> 00:08:17.310
pure cooperation, cooperative
agents, you would expect,

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:20.610
would not bother with
all this indirectness

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:23.170
and beating around the
bush and treasure hunt

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.130
to figure out what the
speaker really means.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.750
In general, when you have cooperators,

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:31.810
they can get away with a
minimum of communication

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:33.570
like a conspiratorial whisper.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:36.620
There's no reason that they, the speaker,

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.838
should lay out all of these puzzles

00:08:38.838 --> 00:08:41.725
of indirectness and euphemism.

00:08:41.725 --> 00:08:45.640
Also, joint actions, like
waltzing, paddling a canoe,

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.770
or making love, are usually
conducted in an atmosphere

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:51.376
of relaxation and mutual enjoyment.

00:08:51.376 --> 00:08:54.160
Whereas, indirect speech
is always suffused

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.480
with some degree of
tension and apprehension.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.370
In particular, cooperation theories

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.860
predict that indirect speech is of a piece

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.420
with a phenomenon of politeness,

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:06.899
a set of tactics by which we bridge gaps

00:09:06.899 --> 00:09:09.890
in power or social distance.

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:13.180
But, in fact, a former
student of mine, James Lee,

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:15.420
now a professor at the
University of Minnesota,

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.410
and I, did some studies that showed

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:19.920
that the phenomenon of politeness

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.550
and the phenomenon of indirectness

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:24.160
are actually qualitatively different.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.770
And I won't show you the data,

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:28.440
but I think just giving
you some of the examples

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.858
will show why they are different.

00:09:31.858 --> 00:09:33.455
When you have a...

00:09:33.455 --> 00:09:37.990
We described a number of
hypothetical scenarios

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:40.838
for our subjects and asked
them what form of speech

00:09:40.838 --> 00:09:43.110
they feel would be most appropriate.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:45.230
What would the character in the scenario

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.220
be most likely to say?

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.100
What would they be most likely to say?

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:51.870
And, indeed, in conformity
with theories of politeness,

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.944
when there is a big gap
in power and distance,

00:09:54.944 --> 00:09:58.420
such as a junior worker
asking a senior worker

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:00.360
at a firm for help on a project,

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:05.360
indeed, many of the reflexes
of politeness were used.

00:10:05.437 --> 00:10:08.668
But the speech was not indirect.

00:10:08.668 --> 00:10:13.668
So for the preferred form
in which the request couched

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:14.893
would be something like,

00:10:14.893 --> 00:10:16.317
"I'm really sorry to bother you, Dave.

00:10:16.317 --> 00:10:18.927
"I wouldn't ask if this
wasn't hugely important to me.

00:10:18.927 --> 00:10:20.677
"But do you think it might
be possible to help me

00:10:20.677 --> 00:10:22.290
"with this analysis?"

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:26.280
There's a lot of cringing
and hedging and hesitation,

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.990
exactly what politeness
theory would predict.

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:33.457
But notice that the request
itself is blurted out.

00:10:33.457 --> 00:10:35.395
"Do you think you could
help me with this analysis?"

00:10:35.395 --> 00:10:38.307
An indirect speech act, such as,

00:10:38.307 --> 00:10:39.467
"I really admire you, Dave.

00:10:39.467 --> 00:10:41.227
"You have the perfect background for this.

00:10:41.227 --> 00:10:42.767
"I wish someone would
have told me in school

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:45.010
"that this stuff would be
really invaluable in my work."

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:46.510
kind of beating around the bush,

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:49.130
was exactly not what people
thought was appropriate

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:50.840
in that setting.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:51.673
In contrast,

00:10:51.673 --> 00:10:53.250
when there is a fraught relationship,

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:56.355
such as a sexual come on,
then you get the opposite.

00:10:56.355 --> 00:10:58.750
The preferred form of speech is indirect,

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:00.670
but it's not particularly polite.

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:04.640
So, for example, what seems
plausible in that context

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.927
would be Michael saying,

00:11:06.927 --> 00:11:08.427
"It's been a really nice evening, Sarah.

00:11:08.427 --> 00:11:09.877
"Would you like to come up to my apartment

00:11:09.877 --> 00:11:11.560
"and see the great view?"

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.930
What he would not say

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:13.763
would be something like,

00:11:13.763 --> 00:11:14.596
"I'm really sorry to

00:11:14.596 --> 00:11:15.429
"bother you, Sarah.
(audience laughing)

00:11:15.429 --> 00:11:17.657
"And I wouldn't ask if this
wasn't hugely importantly to me.

00:11:17.657 --> 00:11:20.255
"But do you think that it
might be possible to have sex?"

00:11:20.255 --> 00:11:21.560
(audience laughing)
So I hope that

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.517
will convince you that
politeness is a real phenomenon

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:27.498
but it is not the same as indirectness.

00:11:27.498 --> 00:11:31.510
In trying to solve this puzzle,

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:35.337
I invoked what I considered
to be the fundamental

00:11:35.337 --> 00:11:37.770
insight of evolutionary psychology,

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:40.010
which I attribute mainly
to Robert Trivers,

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:43.210
which is that all social
relationships involve mixtures

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:45.300
of cooperation and conflict.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:46.700
There is no such thing as

00:11:48.524 --> 00:11:50.100
a relationship that is purely cooperative

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.100
in the sense that the ultimate interest

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.550
of both parties are perfectly aligned,

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:58.728
and indeed that the complex,
coded nature of indirect speech

00:11:58.728 --> 00:12:01.680
reflects exactly this tension.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.610
Now indirect speech is more
than an academic puzzle.

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:08.670
It is also a topic in
linguistics with enormous

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:10.025
practical applications,

00:12:10.025 --> 00:12:12.402
such as in the language of diplomacy.

00:12:12.402 --> 00:12:16.279
Many diplomatic agreements,
such as UN Resolution 242,

00:12:16.279 --> 00:12:20.450
which came in the wake of
the six day Arab-Israeli war

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:25.450
in 1967, are famously
notoriously indirect and vague.

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:29.360
And the parties have
been arguing ever since

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.704
over what the wording actually means.

00:12:31.704 --> 00:12:34.460
The language of blackmail

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:37.740
is often framed in indirect speech.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:41.670
One example came when a man approached

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:43.730
David Letterman a few years ago

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:46.151
with a screenplay about a

00:12:46.151 --> 00:12:49.460
talk show host who was having an affair

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.640
with one of his staffers.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:55.440
This man just offered to sell
the rights of the screenplay

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.490
to David Letterman.

00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:58.070
Now, it so happened that at the time,

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:00.320
David Letterman was having an affair

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.530
with one of his staffers.

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:06.240
He interpreted this not
as an innocent offer

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.020
to buy the rights to a screenplay,

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.470
but as an act of blackmail.

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:14.470
Namely, pay off the guy and
he would keep this secret.

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:19.019
Bribery, many bribers are tendered

00:13:19.019 --> 00:13:22.320
in indirect speech, not just in Fargo

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.703
and New Yorker cartoons, but in real life.

00:13:24.703 --> 00:13:26.446
Again, I'll give you one example.

00:13:26.446 --> 00:13:29.240
When the Equal Rights Amendment

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.310
was just a state short of ratification,

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:35.030
a lobbyist for the National
Organization of Women,

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:38.580
Wanda Brandstetter, handed
an Illinois congressman

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.482
a business card that said:

00:13:40.482 --> 00:13:45.482
Your vote for $1,000 and
the support of the ERA.

00:13:46.767 --> 00:13:49.329
And she was convicted
of attempting to bribe

00:13:49.329 --> 00:13:52.490
a congressman and sentenced to 500 hours

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:53.837
of community service.

00:13:53.837 --> 00:13:58.837
If she had tendered the same
bribe in different language,

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:02.527
using indirect speech, such as,

00:14:02.527 --> 00:14:06.887
"As you know, Congressman,
organizations such as NOW

00:14:06.887 --> 00:14:09.371
"tend to support candidates
whose positions are

00:14:09.371 --> 00:14:11.623
"in harmony with our goals.

00:14:11.623 --> 00:14:13.407
"And as you know, Congressman,

00:14:13.407 --> 00:14:16.627
"one of our goals is passage
of the Equal Rights Amendment.

00:14:16.627 --> 00:14:19.627
"And we are now considering whether to

00:14:19.627 --> 00:14:22.350
"contribute $1000 to your campaign."

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:26.680
Then she would not have
been convictable in court.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.214
And, finally, sexual harassment.

00:14:28.214 --> 00:14:31.426
Those of you who remember the
Clarence Thomas confirmation

00:14:31.426 --> 00:14:34.397
hearings remember the immortal line,

00:14:34.397 --> 00:14:37.150
"Who put pubic hair on my Coke?"

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:41.850
which Clarence Thomas said to Anita Hill

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:44.550
when she was working for him in the office

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:47.410
of Equal Opportunity in
which she interpreted

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:50.160
as a sexual come on, and hence,

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.317
as an example of sexual harassment.

00:14:52.317 --> 00:14:55.830
Now, note, by the way,
that all of these areas

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:59.560
in which indirect speech
has practical applications

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.620
are arenas of conflict.

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:04.360
And I think that is not a coincidence.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:09.130
Well, here is a theory that
James Lee and Martin Nowak

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:12.244
and I have proposed to try
to make sense of this puzzle.

00:15:12.244 --> 00:15:14.990
We call it The Theory of
the Strategic Speaker.

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:17.180
And I will first sum it up in a sentence

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.350
and then unpack each of the propositions

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:20.840
that make up a sentence.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.686
The theory is that indirect
speech is rational strategy

00:15:23.686 --> 00:15:28.214
to attain plausible
deniability of common knowledge

00:15:28.214 --> 00:15:29.849
of relational models.

00:15:29.849 --> 00:15:33.250
None of those mean anything
to you at this point,

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:36.720
but that is a preview of the
three parts of this talk.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.673
Part one, plausible deniability.

00:15:39.673 --> 00:15:42.440
The starting point in this analysis

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.360
is a game theoretic problem

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.330
called the identification problem,

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:48.290
first pointed out by Thomas Schelling

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:51.440
in his classic book, The
Strategy of Conflict.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.430
Namely, how do you figure out
the rational course of action

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:58.370
when the outcome depends on
another intelligent agent

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:01.460
but you don't know the agent's values?

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:04.420
And as it happens, the
example that Schelling used

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:07.681
to illustrate this problem
was bribing a police officer.

00:16:07.681 --> 00:16:10.991
So imagine a rational actor

00:16:10.991 --> 00:16:14.160
pulled over by a policeman who is

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.990
considering two alternatives,

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:20.480
either offer a bribe to the
officer in so many words

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.280
or remaining silent.

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.080
Which of those two courses of action

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.100
brings the higher payoff?

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:28.240
Well, the answer is it depends.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.638
It depends on what kind
of officer you're facing.

00:16:30.638 --> 00:16:33.770
If you're dealing with
a dishonest officer,

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:35.250
he would accept the bribe

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:37.610
and you get the very
high payoff of going free

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:38.443
without a ticket.

00:16:38.443 --> 00:16:39.900
Or in the case of Fargo,

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.210
without being arrested for kidnapping.

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.580
On the other hand, if you
have an honest officer,

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.305
and you tender the bribe,

00:16:46.305 --> 00:16:48.800
then you could get arrested for the crime

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.460
of attempting to bribe an officer,

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.528
which carries a much greater cost

00:16:52.528 --> 00:16:54.687
than the traffic ticket.

00:16:54.687 --> 00:16:58.510
In contrast, if you remain silent

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:00.370
and don't bother offering a bribe at all,

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:02.750
then it doesn't matter what
kind of officer you're facing.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:03.583
In either case,

00:17:03.583 --> 00:17:06.200
you get the moderate
cost of a traffic ticket.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.900
So in comparing the two options,

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.910
one of which has a
guaranteed moderate cost,

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:15.540
one of which has a high
payoff and a high cost,

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:17.130
it's not immediately apparent

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:20.050
which of these two is more attractive.

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:22.640
But now imagine that
there is a third option,

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.450
namely, a veiled bribe,

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:27.277
such as, "I was wondering
if there were some way

00:17:27.277 --> 00:17:29.027
"of settling this without going to court

00:17:29.027 --> 00:17:30.644
"and doing a lot of paperwork."

00:17:30.644 --> 00:17:32.900
Well, now a dishonest officer

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.694
can sniff out the bribe
beneath the innuendo,

00:17:35.694 --> 00:17:37.580
consummate the transaction.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:40.840
You get the very high
payoff of going free.

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.501
An honest officer couldn't
make a bribery charge

00:17:43.501 --> 00:17:46.060
stick in court by the standard of proof

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:47.600
beyond a reasonable doubt.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.087
So he would have to let it pass

00:17:49.087 --> 00:17:50.610
and the worst that you would end up with

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:52.040
is a traffic ticket.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:56.410
So the veiled bribe
combines the high payoff

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:58.830
of bribing a dishonest officer

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:00.560
with a relatively small cost

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.950
of failing to bribe an honest officer

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:04.630
combined in a single option.

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:07.620
And so it is the rational choice.

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:12.620
Now Martin and James and I tried
to formalize this intuition

00:18:12.876 --> 00:18:16.195
by calculating the average expected cost

00:18:16.195 --> 00:18:18.610
of direct and direct bribes.

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:21.790
And it turns out a fairly
simple, game theoretic model

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:24.670
can give you this calculation.

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:28.210
It depends on proportion of
corrupt versus honest cops

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:31.210
in the population of policemen,

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:34.820
the cost of the ticket,
the cost of the bribe,

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:37.640
which has to be less than
the cost of the ticket

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:39.565
or else it would never pay to bribe.

00:18:39.565 --> 00:18:42.140
The cost of an arrest for bribery,

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:44.510
which has to be worse
than the cost of a ticket,

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:46.206
otherwise it would always pay to bribe.

00:18:46.206 --> 00:18:49.661
And, crucially, and this is
where linguistics come in,

00:18:49.661 --> 00:18:52.930
the probability that a
cop will treat a statement

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:54.810
as an attempted bribe.

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:58.045
The result is that an indirect
bribe is the optimal strategy

00:18:58.045 --> 00:19:02.730
if and only if the
threshold of explicitness

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:05.687
required for an honest
cop to arrest a driver

00:19:05.687 --> 00:19:09.270
is greater than the threshold
of explicitness required

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:12.860
for a corrupt cop to accept a bribe.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:16.240
Let me unpack that condition.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:19.720
So, over here, you've got
the linguistic variable

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:24.720
of how naked the, versus tacit,
or implicit the bribe is,

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:29.194
going from perfectly innocent observation

00:19:29.194 --> 00:19:33.990
all the way out to a naked
offer of a quid pro quo,

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:37.208
and which we assume
reflects the probability

00:19:37.208 --> 00:19:39.570
that a hearer will interpret

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:43.520
the proposition as intended to be a bribe.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.210
Over here, we have the expected cost.

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:51.210
Now it turns out that if there is a

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:53.970
continuous function relating

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:55.781
the explicitness of the proposition

00:19:55.781 --> 00:19:59.153
to the probability that the

00:19:59.153 --> 00:20:01.510
officer will interpret it as a bribe,

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:05.000
then for an honest cop,
here is the payoff.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.750
Basically, the more explicit the bribe is,

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:09.000
the higher the cost,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.570
because with an honest cop,

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:12.120
that just means he's more and more likely

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.732
to arrest your for bribery.

00:20:13.732 --> 00:20:15.810
For a corrupt cop,

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:18.530
the more explicit the proposition,

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:21.509
the more likely he is to accept the bribe

00:20:21.509 --> 00:20:25.113
and the lower the cost, that
is the higher the benefit.

00:20:26.704 --> 00:20:28.590
So which is optimal?

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:31.420
Well, it only depends
then on the proportion

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:35.780
of honest and corrupt cops in
the population of policemen.

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:40.780
If there are more honest cops,
then the optimal strategy,

00:20:40.876 --> 00:20:43.130
that is the one with the lowest cost

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:48.130
is just to keep your mouth
shut and don't say anything.

00:20:48.545 --> 00:20:51.930
If there are more corrupt cops,

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:55.680
then the rational strategy is to

00:20:56.570 --> 00:21:00.070
blurt out the bribe in so many words.

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:04.360
So in the case where you
have a continuous function

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.660
relating the probability of interpreting

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:09.180
and ambiguous proposition as a bribe,

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:13.020
indirect speech, in fact,
is not an optimal strategy.

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:15.770
The optimal strategy is either shut up

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:18.260
or offer the bribe in so many words,

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.960
depending only on the proportion of honest

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.860
and corrupt cops in a population.

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:25.700
So under these assumptions, in fact,

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:29.540
there is no rational reason
ever to use indirect speech.

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:31.357
Here's what makes it rational.

00:21:31.357 --> 00:21:34.760
Imagine that there is a
non-linear relationship

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:38.620
between the explicitness of the bribe

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:40.850
and the likelihood that
it will be acted upon

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:42.810
as a bribe, in an extreme case,

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:45.300
a step-function, so that an honest cop

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.600
has a threshold that has
to be a certain degree

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.840
of explicitness before the honest cop

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.752
will whip out the handcuffs
and read you your rights.

00:21:53.752 --> 00:21:56.270
Likewise, for a corrupt cop,

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:59.560
there is a discontinuity and critically

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:03.120
the corrupt cop's threshold is lower

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.050
than the honest cop's threshold.

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:07.340
And presumably, this assymetry

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:09.990
is due to the legal requirement that guilt

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:11.670
in a criminal proceeding be proven

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:13.340
beyond a reasonable doubt.

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:16.390
Well, this gap between the
corrupt cop's threshold

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:19.776
and the honest cop's threshold
means that the average payoff

00:22:19.776 --> 00:22:24.776
shows a local minimum in this region of

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:30.100
intermediate explicitness in
which the costs are lowest,

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:33.545
meaning that it is optimal
for this rational speaker

00:22:33.545 --> 00:22:37.670
to couch his proposition with a degree

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:41.150
of explicitness that falls
between those two thresholds.

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:42.793
So that's the model.

00:22:42.793 --> 00:22:44.760
Another way of putting it

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.950
is that when you have different payoffs

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:49.660
with different hearers,
and different thresholds

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:50.910
for those hearers,

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:53.240
then you get a logic of what we

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.330
informally refer to as
plausible deniability.

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:58.344
So what I just shown you
is a kind of formalization

00:22:58.344 --> 00:23:02.480
of the common sense notion
of plausible deniability.

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:05.500
Now, note, by the way, that this analysis,

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.083
even though it's, I hope,
it's fairly intuitive,

00:23:08.083 --> 00:23:10.940
shows why pure cooperation

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:13.970
is not enough to explain indirect speech.

00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:16.180
There is an inherent
role of conflict here.

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:19.860
Indirect speech is not being
used to help an honest officer

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:23.260
attain his goal, but rather
to confound or thwart him

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:24.690
in attaining this goal,

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:27.220
because the interest of the officer

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:30.070
and the interest of the driver
are not perfectly aligned.

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:33.840
And the critical prediction, recall,

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.020
is that there are different
thresholds for acting on

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:40.260
an ambiguous proposition
between the honest

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:41.810
and dishonest cops.

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:46.450
And, in fact, James and I
ran a number of experiments

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:49.780
in which we gave people
a set of propositions,

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:51.330
varying in explicitness,

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:55.210
ask them if they were an officer
or if they were expecting

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:57.727
an officer to act, at what
level in the continuum

00:23:57.727 --> 00:23:59.410
would they expect them to act?

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:02.670
And, indeed, everyone agreed

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:04.810
that honest cops would
need a greater degree

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:08.160
of explicitness before making an arrest

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:11.313
than dishonest cops would
need in acting on a bribe.

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:15.171
Okay, that part seems
pretty straightforward.

00:24:15.171 --> 00:24:20.171
But it leaves open the
question of why people

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:23.020
use indirect speech in
non-legal situations

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:27.490
when there are no financial or
legal payoffs and penalties.

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:30.264
It's not as if we
constantly live under the

00:24:30.264 --> 00:24:33.890
threat of prosecution for our actions.

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:37.440
Why then do we still use
so much indirect speech

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:41.561
in every day life, such as
in everyday cases of bribery?

00:24:41.561 --> 00:24:44.837
Now, you might react,
"Everyday cases of bribery?

00:24:44.837 --> 00:24:45.670
"What do you mean?

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:50.607
"When would I, an honest,
upstanding law-abiding citizen

00:24:50.607 --> 00:24:53.449
"ever be tempted to offer a bribe?"

00:24:53.449 --> 00:24:55.380
Well, how's this?

00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:57.890
You want to go to the
hottest restaurant in town,

00:24:57.890 --> 00:24:59.380
you have no reservation.

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:02.430
Why not slip the maître d a $20 bill

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:04.170
in exchange for jumping the queue

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:05.682
and being seated immediately.

00:25:05.682 --> 00:25:09.726
This is the assignment that
an editor at Gourmet magazine

00:25:09.726 --> 00:25:12.570
gave the writer Bruce Feiler.

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:14.360
He dared him to try it

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.710
at Manhattan's most exclusive restaurants

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:19.348
on a Saturday night and
write up his experiences

00:25:19.348 --> 00:25:21.113
for the readers of the magazine.

00:25:22.618 --> 00:25:26.261
As a psychologist, I found this
article utterly fascinating.

00:25:26.261 --> 00:25:30.360
First of all, despite the
fact that as far as I know

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:31.920
no one has ever been arrested

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.330
for the crime of attempting
to bribe a maître d'.

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:35.690
(audience laughing)

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:38.420
The assignment filled him with anxiety.

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:40.520
And I'm going to read to you

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:44.297
from the first paragraph
of the magazine article.

00:25:44.297 --> 00:25:46.527
"I am nervous, truly nervous.

00:25:46.527 --> 00:25:48.957
"As the taxi bounces through
the trendier neighborhoods

00:25:48.957 --> 00:25:52.019
"of Manhattan, I keep
imagining the possible retorts

00:25:52.019 --> 00:25:54.552
"of some incensed maître d'.

00:25:54.552 --> 00:25:57.084
"'What kind of establishment
do you think this is?

00:25:57.084 --> 00:25:59.333
"'How dare you insult me.

00:25:59.333 --> 00:26:01.737
"'Do you think you can get in with that?'"

00:26:01.737 --> 00:26:03.940
(audience laughing)
Second interesting

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:05.720
psychological phenomenon

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:06.700
displayed in this article

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:08.950
is that when Feiler did
screw up the courage

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:13.820
to offer the bribe, he
instinctively used indirect speech.

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:16.130
He folded up a $20 bill,

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:19.588
held it outside the line of
vision in peripheral vision

00:26:19.588 --> 00:26:21.920
and he said to the maître d',

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.467
depending on the restaurant, things like,

00:26:24.467 --> 00:26:25.722
"I hope you can fit us in.

00:26:25.722 --> 00:26:28.253
"Can you speed up my wait?

00:26:28.253 --> 00:26:31.306
"I was wondering if you
might have a cancellation."

00:26:31.306 --> 00:26:34.325
So indirect speech really
does come naturally to us.

00:26:34.325 --> 00:26:38.310
And the third interesting
part of the article

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:42.007
was the outcome, which is
that it worked every time.

00:26:42.007 --> 00:26:43.430
(audience laughing)

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:48.430
He said, "We were seated in
between two and four minutes

00:26:48.557 --> 00:26:50.904
"to the astonishment of my date."

00:26:50.904 --> 00:26:52.900
So what's going on here?

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:54.780
What are the intangible costs

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.300
that drive people to indirect speech?

00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:58.510
And here's a theory,

00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:01.704
that the cost consists of
relationship mismatches.

00:27:01.704 --> 00:27:04.600
In particular, that
human relationships fall

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.890
into a small number of types,

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:09.765
each of which has a rule
for distributing resources,

00:27:09.765 --> 00:27:14.396
each has a distinct evolutionary
and neurobiological basis.

00:27:14.396 --> 00:27:18.450
Each applies, by default,
to certain kinds of dyads,

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:20.179
contexts and resources.

00:27:20.179 --> 00:27:22.480
In this theory of relationship types,

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:27.480
I have borrowed, maybe stolen,
from the anthropologist

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:31.518
Alan Fiske, who has worked
out this theory in detail.

00:27:31.518 --> 00:27:34.670
And of the three natural
relationship types,

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:36.220
the first is dominance,

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:40.410
its rule for distributing
resources is don't mess with me,

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:45.410
the dominant individual
commandeers resources,

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.781
which are his prerogative.

00:27:47.781 --> 00:27:51.100
Presumably they evolve from
the dominance hierarchies

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:54.040
that are ubiquitous among primates.

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:55.570
A very different relationship type

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:57.950
is communality or communal sharing,

00:27:57.950 --> 00:27:59.700
whose rule for distributing resources

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.642
is what's mine is thine
what's thine is mine,

00:28:02.642 --> 00:28:07.470
which presumably evolve via
mechanisms of kin selection

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:10.348
and mutualism, and which
are found by default

00:28:10.348 --> 00:28:14.520
among biological kin between spouses

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.632
and among close intimate friends.

00:28:16.632 --> 00:28:20.950
And reciprocity where the
rule is you scratch my back,

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:21.940
I'll scratch yours,

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:24.773
and follows the logic
of reciprocal altruism.

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.390
Now, critically, behavior that acceptable

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:31.284
when one relational model is enforced

00:28:31.284 --> 00:28:33.659
can be anomalous in another.

00:28:33.659 --> 00:28:36.340
For example, at a party, you might go over

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:38.784
to your boyfriend or
girlfriend or husband or wife

00:28:38.784 --> 00:28:41.519
and help yourself to a
shrimp off their plate.

00:28:41.519 --> 00:28:44.237
But you wouldn't go up to
your graduate supervisor

00:28:44.237 --> 00:28:48.100
or your dean and help yourself
to a shrimp off his plate,

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.610
because what you can get
away with in a relationship

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:54.380
of communality, namely,
sharing without account,

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:56.710
you can't get away with in
a relationship of dominance.

00:28:56.710 --> 00:29:01.710
Or if a good friend had you
over for a nice dinner party,

00:29:02.232 --> 00:29:04.080
at the conclusion of the evening,

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.410
you wouldn't pull out your wallet

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:07.436
and try to pay him for
the cost of the meal,

00:29:07.436 --> 00:29:12.340
because friendships obey
the rules of communality

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:16.310
and it would be inappropriate
to apply reciprocity.

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:18.600
Conversely, if you were at a restaurant,

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.255
you wouldn't go over to the owner and say,

00:29:20.255 --> 00:29:23.157
"Oh, that was a great meal,
we had a really nice time

00:29:23.157 --> 00:29:26.710
"and we'll have you back over sometime."

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:28.490
(audience laughing)

00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:31.490
Now those are cases in
which the relational model

00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:34.890
that's enforced is clear to both parties

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:37.646
and so any kind of breach
would be the subject

00:29:37.646 --> 00:29:40.688
of comedy or amusement.

00:29:40.688 --> 00:29:44.650
But there are cases in which
the relational model in force

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:45.790
can be ambiguous.

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:48.810
And in that case, any
divergent understanding

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:51.680
can lead to unpleasant emotion

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:54.710
for which we have a name, awkwardness.

00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:57.870
For example, there can be
awkward moments in a workplace

00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:01.940
in which a student doesn't
know whether they're ready to

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:04.350
address their advisor
on a first-name basis,

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:07.033
or they can invite them
out after work for a beer.

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:11.560
It's a well-known bit
of conventional wisdom

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.580
that close friends should never engage

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:14.900
in a business transaction,

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:17.370
such as one of them selling
his car to the other.

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:20.380
The very act of negotiating a price

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:23.107
can, a we say, put a
strain on the friendship,

00:30:23.107 --> 00:30:28.107
because the rules of
reciprocity are appropriate to

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:31.710
neighbors or business
partners or coworkers,

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:34.310
but are not appropriate within the

00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:36.446
dyad of a close friendship.

00:30:36.446 --> 00:30:41.070
The possible clash
between a dominance model

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:44.290
and the communal sharing of sex,

00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:46.920
such as when a supervisor solicits sex

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:49.320
from an employee or a student

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:52.074
leads to the infraction
of sexual harassment.

00:30:52.074 --> 00:30:55.250
And even the clash between two different

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:57.844
kinds of communal relationship,
friendship or sex,

00:30:57.844 --> 00:31:01.884
give rise to all of the tensions
and complexities of dating,

00:31:01.884 --> 00:31:04.650
which are often worked
out for our amusement

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:06.675
in romantic comedies.

00:31:06.675 --> 00:31:11.040
Well, this gives rise to a
social identification problem

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.600
in which the social cost of awkwardness

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:15.514
from a mismatched relationship type

00:31:15.514 --> 00:31:18.180
can duplicate the payoff matrix

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:20.300
of a legal identification problem,

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:22.397
such as bribing a police officer.

00:31:22.397 --> 00:31:26.750
So let's work out why it feels so nervous

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:30.240
to be given the assignment
of bribing a maître d'.

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.220
Now the key thing in bribing a maître d'

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:35.202
is that the maître d'
ordinarily wields a relationship

00:31:35.202 --> 00:31:38.830
of authority over his restaurant fiefdom.

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:42.720
He's in charge, he seats people
where and when he pleases.

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.850
The act of offering a bribe

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:46.390
would change the relationship type

00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:50.470
into obligating him to seat you at a table

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:52.870
in exchange for accepting the bribe.

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:56.960
So, again, let's start off
with the rational actor model

00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:00.600
in which your only two options
are to tender a naked bribe

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:04.415
in so many words or not to bribe at all.

00:32:04.415 --> 00:32:08.070
What is the optimal strategy?

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:11.080
Well, again, it depends
on whether you're facing

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:14.875
a corrupt maître d' who
would accept the bribe,

00:32:14.875 --> 00:32:18.280
consummate a reciprocity relationship

00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:19.810
and show you to a quick table

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:21.999
without any emotional costs.

00:32:21.999 --> 00:32:24.250
On the other hand, you might be facing

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:26.300
a scrupulous maître d'

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:31.240
who would maintain his
dominance, rebuff the offer

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:33.713
of reciprocity by saying something like,

00:32:33.713 --> 00:32:35.317
"How dare you insult me.

00:32:35.317 --> 00:32:36.877
"Do you think you can get in with that?

00:32:36.877 --> 00:32:39.330
"What kind of establishment
do you think this is?"

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:43.261
Giving rise to the high
emotional cost of awkwardness.

00:32:43.261 --> 00:32:46.650
In contrast, if you just wait your turn

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:48.900
and show up and are happy to be seated

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.618
an hour and-a-half later, you are seeding

00:32:51.618 --> 00:32:54.260
the dominance relationship
to the maître d',

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:56.830
but you pay the moderate
cost of a long wait.

00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:58.790
So the high payoff of a quick table,

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:00.641
high emotional cost of awkwardness

00:33:00.641 --> 00:33:04.590
have to be balanced against
the guaranteed moderate cost

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:06.390
of a long wait with no

00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:08.680
emotional awkwardness.

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.700
However, if you had the third option,

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:15.000
such as, "I was wondering if
you might have a cancellation."

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.930
then, again, the corrupt maître d'

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:20.220
could sniff out the bribe
beneath the innuendo,

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:22.330
consummate a reciprocity relationship,

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:23.860
show you to a quick table.

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:26.680
A scrupulous maître d' could choose to let

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:31.680
the comment pass without
surrending his claim to being a

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:36.645
rational, sane, user of
the English language.

00:33:36.645 --> 00:33:40.121
By letting it pass, he maintains
his dominance relationship.

00:33:40.121 --> 00:33:42.000
You still have the long wait,

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.620
but you don't have the awkwardness.

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:46.390
And so the ambiguous bribe maintains the

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:49.670
high payoff of a quick table that you get

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:51.249
from bribing a corrupt maître d'

00:33:51.249 --> 00:33:55.350
with the relatively small
cost of failing to bribe

00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:58.380
a scrupulous maître d'
combined in one option.

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:01.340
And that is why the logic
of plausible deniability

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:04.830
applies not just to legal context

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:06.950
like bribing a cop, but to every day

00:34:07.947 --> 00:34:10.967
context such as bribing a maître d'.

00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:15.280
Okay, I promised that the
theory needed three parts.

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.670
And here is the third part.

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:19.073
There is still a problem with this theory,

00:34:19.073 --> 00:34:22.770
which is why do people
resort to indirect speech

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:25.606
even when uncertainty is low or absent?

00:34:25.606 --> 00:34:29.260
When there's no actual
identification problem,

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:31.829
because you can anticipate
tha tall listeners

00:34:31.829 --> 00:34:34.503
have the same values to be concrete,

00:34:34.503 --> 00:34:37.034
you now are in possession of the knowledge

00:34:37.034 --> 00:34:40.841
that all Manhattan
maître d's are bribable.

00:34:40.841 --> 00:34:43.520
Nonetheless, I suspect that if you ever

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.700
were to try to duplicate this stunt

00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:48.660
and try to jump the
queue, you probably still

00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:50.150
would use indirect speech

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:52.510
rather than blurting out your bribe

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:54.170
as a quid pro quo.

00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:56.400
And, indeed, in our questionnaires

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.937
where we ask people,
"What kind of language

00:34:58.937 --> 00:35:02.077
"would you use in these circumstances?"

00:35:02.077 --> 00:35:06.510
Even when we tell people
100% of the cops are bribable

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:08.269
in this country that
you're driving through,

00:35:08.269 --> 00:35:10.230
the corruption is so rampant

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:13.783
that it is guaranteed that
every cop will be bribable,

00:35:13.783 --> 00:35:16.740
they still opted for indirect speech

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:19.855
as the preferred method
of addressing the officer.

00:35:19.855 --> 00:35:24.855
Or in cases where there is no uncertainty

00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:28.300
on the part of the hearer as
to what the speaker means.

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:30.560
It's hard to believe that any grown woman

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:33.300
would really be fooled by
the line about the etchings.

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:35.830
Nonetheless, I think you would agree

00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:38.786
that there is something
that is much less awkward,

00:35:38.786 --> 00:35:43.297
much more comfortable about the line,

00:35:43.297 --> 00:35:44.740
"Would you like to see my etchings?"

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:46.553
than, "Would you like to
come up and have sex?"

00:35:46.553 --> 00:35:50.510
So the deniability is really,
when it comes down to it,

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:51.950
not all that plausible.

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:53.821
As we say, it doesn't
pass the giggle test.

00:35:53.821 --> 00:35:57.710
So why should a transparent
innuendo still feel

00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:59.600
less awkward than an overture

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.697
that is, as we say, on the record.

00:36:01.697 --> 00:36:06.100
I mentioned that some of these ambiguities

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:09.900
are the subject matter
of romantic comedies.

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:11.950
And I'll give you an example
from the romantic comedy

00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:14.550
When Harry Met Sally that
illustrates this point.

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:17.260
At one point, the couple has

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:18.410
just met each other.

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:21.802
Each of them has another
boyfriend or girlfriend.

00:36:21.802 --> 00:36:23.639
They're confined to a long car trip

00:36:23.639 --> 00:36:27.820
and Harry makes a suggestion
that Sally interprets

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:29.110
as a come on.

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:31.111
And she accuses him,
"You're coming onto me"

00:36:31.111 --> 00:36:33.677
And Harry says, "What do
you want me to do about it?

00:36:33.677 --> 00:36:34.677
"I take it back, okay?

00:36:34.677 --> 00:36:36.180
"I take it back."

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:37.860
She says, "You can't take it back."

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:39.147
He said, "Why not?"

00:36:39.147 --> 00:36:41.610
She said, "Because it's
already out there."

00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:43.147
Said, "Oh, geez, what
are we supposed to do?

00:36:43.147 --> 00:36:44.177
"Call the cops?

00:36:44.177 --> 00:36:45.834
"It's already out there."

00:36:45.834 --> 00:36:47.240
So here's the puzzle.

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:50.800
What is going on when
we have the intuition

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:54.387
that an overture is out
there or on the record

00:36:54.387 --> 00:36:56.380
that makes it so much worse

00:36:56.380 --> 00:37:00.240
than a veiled overture that
is implicated indirectly,

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:02.518
even in cases where
there's no uncertainty,

00:37:02.518 --> 00:37:05.073
real uncertainty, as to
what the overture means?

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:09.490
And our suggestion is
that the key difference

00:37:09.490 --> 00:37:14.050
is a concept from economics,
semantics and game theory

00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:15.862
called common knowledge,

00:37:15.862 --> 00:37:18.520
which has to be distinguished
from shared knowledge.

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:20.420
Common knowledge is also
sometimes referred to

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:22.926
as mutual knowledge or common ground.

00:37:22.926 --> 00:37:26.060
Now, in shared knowledge, A knows X,

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:27.690
and B knows X.

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:30.693
In common knowledge, A
knows X, and B knows X

00:37:30.693 --> 00:37:33.560
and A knows that B knows X and B knows

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.877
that A knows X and A knows that B knows

00:37:35.877 --> 00:37:37.560
that A knows X.
(audience laughing)

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:39.330
Ad infinitum.

00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:43.020
Now this might seem implausible as a

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:47.560
psychological hypothesis,
because you can't fit an

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:50.320
infinite set of nested propositions

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:51.980
into a finite brain.

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:54.120
But as in other cases in linguistics

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:57.543
in which we attribute infinite
knowledge to a finite brain,

00:37:57.543 --> 00:37:59.470
there's no paradox here,

00:37:59.470 --> 00:38:00.450
because common knowledge

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:02.570
could be captured in a recursive formula,

00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:05.070
formula that makes reference to itself.

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:07.180
Namely, X is common knowledge

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:09.547
if people share the proposition Y

00:38:09.547 --> 00:38:12.675
where the proposition
Y is everyone knows X

00:38:12.675 --> 00:38:14.570
and everyone knows Y.

00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:16.770
Y being the proposition, everyone knows X

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:18.070
and everyone knows Y.

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:20.000
That can fit into a finite brain

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.208
and it summarizes in a formula

00:38:22.208 --> 00:38:25.400
the whole set of infinite
nested propositions

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:27.031
without having to spell them out.

00:38:27.031 --> 00:38:31.250
Also, common knowledge can
be ascertained perceptually

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:33.810
from the circumstances in
which X is transmitted.

00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:36.257
You don't literally have to
have someone explain to you,

00:38:36.257 --> 00:38:38.127
"Well, you see, he knows that she knows

00:38:38.127 --> 00:38:39.200
"that he knows, that she knows."

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:40.033
And so on.

00:38:40.033 --> 00:38:43.250
There's certain cases, such
as, which I will get to,

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:45.510
such a salient public signal

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:48.833
in which common knowledge can
be generated instantaneously.

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:51.160
Now the reason that common knowledge

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:54.719
has been of such interest to
economics and game theorists

00:38:54.719 --> 00:38:55.840
is that it is

00:38:55.840 --> 00:39:00.050
necessary to find equilibria
in coordination games.

00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:01.103
Well, what does that mean?

00:39:01.103 --> 00:39:04.500
Well, the original formulation
of a coordination game

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:07.860
comes from the philosopher
Jean-Jacques Rousseau

00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:10.158
from his parable of the stag hunt.

00:39:10.158 --> 00:39:13.280
Imagine that there are two hunters.

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:16.170
They set out each day
either to hunt rabbit,

00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:18.820
a very small payoff or to hunt stag,

00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:20.597
a large payoff.

00:39:20.597 --> 00:39:23.066
The problem is while
each one, individually,

00:39:23.066 --> 00:39:26.250
can catch a rabbit,

00:39:26.250 --> 00:39:28.240
it takes the two of them working together

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:30.059
to fell a stag.

00:39:30.059 --> 00:39:34.250
However, they have to decide
at the beginning of each day

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:37.161
which of the two quarry they aim for.

00:39:37.161 --> 00:39:39.022
And they cannot communicate.

00:39:39.022 --> 00:39:43.580
So why would a hunter decide
to go out and hunt stag?

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:45.320
Well, he has to be assured

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:46.480
that the other hunters

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:49.190
will also decide that
morning to hunt stag.

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:50.970
Why would they decide to hunt stag?

00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:53.500
Well, they would only do
it if they thought that the

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:55.180
other hunters would do it.

00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:57.460
But why would they think the
other hunters would do it?

00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:59.711
Well, only if they thought
that the first one would do it,

00:39:59.711 --> 00:40:01.170
ad infinitum.

00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:05.527
In fact, any number of
embedded states of knowledge,

00:40:05.527 --> 00:40:08.247
"I think that he knows
that I want to hunt stag.

00:40:08.247 --> 00:40:11.487
"But I don't know that
he knows that I know,

00:40:11.487 --> 00:40:13.070
"that he knows that I know it."

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:16.070
is rationally not sufficient to

00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:17.940
make the decision to hunt stag.

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:20.530
The tragedy would be that each one of them

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:22.040
would settle for rabbit,

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:25.202
whereas if only they could
attain this common knowledge,

00:40:25.202 --> 00:40:30.202
they would both be incentivized
to hunt stag together.

00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:33.130
However, if there were some common signal,

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:38.130
if you raise a flag saying
"I'd like to hunt stag today"

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:41.000
and the other guy can see it and you know

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.540
that the other guy can see it,

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:44.740
that can solve the problem.

00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:47.330
There are many examples
of coordination games

00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:50.623
in every day life that are
solved by common knowledge.

00:40:50.623 --> 00:40:53.670
Driving on the right or
the left side of the road,

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:57.180
there's no inherent advantage to driving

00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:59.370
on the right side of the road
or the left side of the road,

00:40:59.370 --> 00:41:01.460
but there is an advantage
to everyone driving

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:02.941
on the same side of the road.

00:41:02.941 --> 00:41:06.253
In order, and it's not enough to think,

00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:09.465
if you're in a country where
you don't know what side it is,

00:41:09.465 --> 00:41:12.690
I think that the other guy's
gonna drive on the right,

00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:14.280
because he may wanna drive on the right,

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:15.340
but he's not gonna do so

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:16.530
unless he thinks that everyone else

00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:18.310
is also gonna drive on the right,

00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:19.660
which means that when you have a country

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:21.690
that decides to switch sides,

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:24.700
such as Sweden did in 1969,

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:27.640
there has to be an enormous
amount of publicity

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:30.190
on when the switchover occurs.

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:33.748
I believe it was December
31st, midnight, 1969.

00:41:33.748 --> 00:41:37.730
And that has to be so public
that not only do you know it

00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:40.985
but you know that all of
your fellow citizens know it.

00:41:40.985 --> 00:41:44.417
Paper currency, and other paper assets

00:41:44.417 --> 00:41:47.695
are valuable to the extent that everyone

00:41:47.695 --> 00:41:50.930
knows that everyone else
knows, that everyone else knows

00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:51.830
that it's valuable.

00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:54.530
Which means that when you have
threats to common knowledge,

00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:58.910
As in hyper-inflation, bank
runs and speculative bubbles,

00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:03.750
you can get the value of a
currency very quickly unraveling.

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:05.447
Political action.

00:42:05.447 --> 00:42:10.447
Why is freedom of assembly
considered a fundamental right?

00:42:10.810 --> 00:42:14.260
And why are dictators
the world over terrified

00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:17.347
of the prospect of people
assembling peacefully?

00:42:17.347 --> 00:42:20.597
Well, if you have a large population

00:42:20.597 --> 00:42:23.570
that all is disgruntled with a tyrant,

00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:26.700
then that is not enough
for them to take action,

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:29.819
because any one of them
standing up can be picked off.

00:42:29.819 --> 00:42:32.107
All of them standing up simultaneously

00:42:32.107 --> 00:42:35.340
would be too formidable a
force for the tyrant to ignore.

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:37.570
But people can't afford to stand up

00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:40.100
unless they know that everyone else knows

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:43.710
that everyone else knows that
there's enough discontent

00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:45.670
to motivate them all to stand up,

00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:47.770
which is why showing up at a public place,

00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:49.752
where not only are you carrying your signs

00:42:49.752 --> 00:42:51.111
and yelling at the dictator,

00:42:51.111 --> 00:42:53.440
but you see everyone else around you

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:54.730
also carrying the signs

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:57.440
and you know that they can
see you and see each other.

00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:01.024
And that's what empowers
a crowd to challenge

00:43:01.024 --> 00:43:02.920
the dominance of a dictator.

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:05.030
Nowadays, that can occasionally be done

00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:09.210
not just by physical presence,
everyone seeing each other,

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:11.180
but by an electronic equivalent.

00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:14.590
If everyone knows that a
message if posted on Twitter,

00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:16.110
where everyone else can see it,

00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:18.417
that can generate the
same common knowledge.

00:43:18.417 --> 00:43:21.587
Now relational models,

00:43:21.587 --> 00:43:26.587
that is whether the rules
in force, in a given dyad,

00:43:26.602 --> 00:43:31.460
are authority, communality
or reciprocity are kind of

00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:33.160
coordination equilibria.

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:36.691
You can kind of decide how
you're going to distribute the

00:43:36.691 --> 00:43:40.340
shrimp or the money or
the sex without having to

00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:42.090
squabble over it every time.

00:43:42.090 --> 00:43:44.620
And so where both parties tacitly agree

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:47.268
on how to deal with
these common resources.

00:43:47.268 --> 00:43:50.299
So the question is,

00:43:50.299 --> 00:43:52.130
which I alluded to earlier,

00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:54.740
how do people arrive at the
common knowledge necessary

00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:57.498
to reach equilibria in coordination games.

00:43:57.498 --> 00:44:01.910
Well, salient public events are
common knowledge generators.

00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:04.760
And, perhaps, ny favorite
illustration of this

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:07.487
is the story of the emperors new clothes.

00:44:07.487 --> 00:44:10.117
When the little boy cried out in public,

00:44:10.117 --> 00:44:11.804
"The emperor has no clothes."

00:44:11.804 --> 00:44:14.183
He wasn't telling anyone anything

00:44:14.183 --> 00:44:16.040
that they didn't already know

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.923
anything they couldn't see
with their own eyeballs.

00:44:17.923 --> 00:44:19.010
But, nonetheless,

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:21.370
he was changing the
state of their knowledge.

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:22.860
Because at that moment,

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:24.870
everyone knew that everyone else knew

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:26.985
that everyone else knew
that the emperor was naked.

00:44:26.985 --> 00:44:29.310
He generated common knowledge.

00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:30.380
And the common knowledge

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:31.960
empowered them to challenge

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:34.200
the dominance of the emperor.

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.970
The moral of story being

00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:38.695
that direct speech, blurting something out

00:44:38.695 --> 00:44:41.090
generates common knowledge.

00:44:41.090 --> 00:44:45.260
And that leads, I submit,
to the third piece

00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:48.100
of the puzzle of innuendo
and indirect speech.

00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:51.494
Namely, indirect speech
provides shared knowledge.

00:44:51.494 --> 00:44:54.290
Direct speech provides common knowledge.

00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:57.717
And relationships, which are
a kind of coordination game

00:44:57.717 --> 00:45:01.020
are maintained or nullified
by common knowledge

00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:02.990
of the relationship type.

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:04.184
To be more concrete,

00:45:04.184 --> 00:45:05.947
if Harry says to Sally,

00:45:05.947 --> 00:45:07.794
"Would you like to come
up and see my etchings?"

00:45:07.794 --> 00:45:09.396
And Sally says, "No."

00:45:09.396 --> 00:45:12.260
Well, Sally knows that she has turned down

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:13.560
a sexual overture.

00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.387
She's a grown woman, she's no fool.

00:45:15.387 --> 00:45:18.417
Harry knows that she has
turned down a sexual overture,

00:45:18.417 --> 00:45:19.950
he's no fool.

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:22.860
But does Sally know that Harry knows?

00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:24.317
She could still wonder,

00:45:24.317 --> 00:45:27.050
"Well, maybe Harry thinks that I'm naive."

00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:29.760
And does Harry know that
Sally knows that he knows?

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:30.593
Harry could be wondering,

00:45:30.593 --> 00:45:32.666
"Well, maybe Sally thinks I'm dense."

00:45:32.666 --> 00:45:34.790
There's no common knowledge

00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:37.240
and that allows them
to maintain the fiction

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:38.400
of a friendship.

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:40.630
The sexual overture can be rebuffed

00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:43.520
and they could resume
their life as friends.

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:45.367
Whereas, if Harry were to have said,

00:45:45.367 --> 00:45:47.140
"Would you like to come up and have sex?"

00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:49.340
Well, now Harry knows that Sally knows

00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:51.170
that Harry knows that Sally knows.

00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:53.850
They cannot maintain the
fiction of a friendship.

00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:55.700
And this is, we suggest,

00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:57.760
what's behind that gut feeling

00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:00.700
that with direct speech
you can't take it back.

00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:02.417
It's out there.

00:46:02.417 --> 00:46:07.417
Okay, this is what we hope
is a nice three-part theory.

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:10.210
Is there any evidence that it is true?

00:46:10.210 --> 00:46:12.260
So James Lee and I tried to test it

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:15.273
by coming up with a number
of fictional scenarios.

00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:19.928
In them, a speaker utters a proposition

00:46:19.928 --> 00:46:22.680
that varies in level of directness.

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:24.800
That's our main independent variable.

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:27.260
We asked the subject to
put himself or herself

00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:29.750
in either the speaker's
shoes or the hearer's shoes

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:32.908
and rate the likelihood
of various interpretations

00:46:32.908 --> 00:46:36.820
of the proposition and
various emotional responses

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:41.830
as they imagine themselves
to be in that scenario.

00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:43.410
We had a bribe scenario

00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:45.450
where Kyle was pulled over for speeding.

00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:48.257
And he says to the officer,
depending on the condition,

00:46:48.257 --> 00:46:49.727
"I'm very sorry, officer.

00:46:49.727 --> 00:46:50.887
"I really learned my lesson.

00:46:50.887 --> 00:46:53.720
"From now on, you can be sure
that I'll be more careful."

00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:56.730
With the $50 bill protruding.

00:46:56.730 --> 00:47:01.730
That's a proposition that
is very vague and indirect.

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:04.867
One not more direct,
"I'm very sorry, officer.

00:47:04.867 --> 00:47:07.117
"I know that I was speeding
and that I'll have to pay

00:47:07.117 --> 00:47:08.429
"for my mistake.

00:47:08.429 --> 00:47:09.847
"I'm very sorry, officer,

00:47:09.847 --> 00:47:11.507
"but I'm actually in the
middle of something right now.

00:47:11.507 --> 00:47:12.547
"Sort of an emergency.

00:47:12.547 --> 00:47:14.557
"So maybe the best thing would
be to take care of this here

00:47:14.557 --> 00:47:17.040
"without going to court or
doing a lot of paperwork."

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:19.017
And, finally, "I'm very sorry, officer.

00:47:19.017 --> 00:47:21.096
"If I give you a 50 will
you just let me go?"

00:47:21.096 --> 00:47:23.117
(audience laughing)

00:47:23.117 --> 00:47:24.430
You have seduction scenario.

00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:26.715
Michael and Lisa are
coworkers and good friends,

00:47:26.715 --> 00:47:29.410
have a nice dinner,
Michael drives Lisa home.

00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:30.837
When passing his apartment, he says,

00:47:30.837 --> 00:47:34.027
"Wow, I feel like we've
been talking so much.

00:47:34.027 --> 00:47:35.910
"But it's only 10:30."

00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:38.357
or, "My friend just
emailed me those pictures

00:47:38.357 --> 00:47:40.327
"from our trip to Europe
that I was telling you about.

00:47:40.327 --> 00:47:42.680
"Do you wanna come over and have a look?"

00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:44.357
Or, "You know, I have
a really terrific view

00:47:44.357 --> 00:47:45.190
"from my balcony.

00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:47.717
"You can see the whole city,
the lights, the oceans.

00:47:47.717 --> 00:47:50.310
"Would you like to come
over and have a look?"

00:47:50.310 --> 00:47:52.097
or, "I find you really attractive

00:47:52.097 --> 00:47:53.707
"and I enjoyed being
with you tonight a lot.

00:47:53.707 --> 00:47:55.700
"Would you like to come
over and have sex?"

00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:57.623
So that was the bluntness

00:47:57.623 --> 00:47:59.656
continuum in the seduction scenario.

00:47:59.656 --> 00:48:01.610
Then we also had a threat scenario,

00:48:01.610 --> 00:48:03.970
where an unscrupulous professor

00:48:03.970 --> 00:48:06.360
threatens a student with
a loss of a fellowship

00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:08.580
if she doesn't work in his lab.

00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:12.310
So I mentioned the theory
comes in three parts.

00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:14.457
Here are some tests of
each of the three parts.

00:48:14.457 --> 00:48:16.733
The first one and the most basic one

00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:21.790
speaks to the notion of
plausible deniability.

00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:25.870
Namely, does the linguistic
variable of directness

00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:28.450
or indirectness actually correspond

00:48:28.450 --> 00:48:30.425
to a continuum of probability

00:48:30.425 --> 00:48:34.349
of the listener giving
various interpretations

00:48:34.349 --> 00:48:36.513
to the proposition.

00:48:36.513 --> 00:48:39.410
This is, is indirect speech
just a social ritual,

00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:41.090
like please or thank you.

00:48:41.090 --> 00:48:43.610
Or is it an uncertainty generator

00:48:43.610 --> 00:48:45.063
about the speaker's intent.

00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:48.120
That was pretty easy to test.

00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:50.527
In these various
scenarios, we asked people

00:48:50.527 --> 00:48:54.267
"Does the hearer
understand what the speaker

00:48:54.267 --> 00:48:55.100
"really means?"

00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:58.290
Namely, interpreting as a
bribe, a threat or a come on.

00:48:58.290 --> 00:49:03.290
The X axis is how overt
the proposition was.

00:49:03.619 --> 00:49:06.557
Perhaps, not surprisingly,
with overt speech.

00:49:06.557 --> 00:49:11.145
100% of the subjects deemed
it to be 100% certain

00:49:11.145 --> 00:49:13.810
that it was a bribe, threat or come on,

00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:17.050
and with varying degrees of indirectness,

00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:19.726
the likelihood that it
was interpreted as a bribe

00:49:19.726 --> 00:49:21.920
fell accordingly.

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:25.130
Prediction number two
is that indirect speech

00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:27.520
should be perceived as less
likely to get the speaker

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:28.760
into legal trouble,

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:31.923
such as being found
guilty in a bribery trial

00:49:31.923 --> 00:49:34.570
or subject to a disciplinary hearing

00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:37.036
if the student blew the
whistle on the professor.

00:49:37.036 --> 00:49:41.280
And, once again, that is
very much the perception

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:43.990
of people as the imagine
themselves in the scenario.

00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:45.000
That is, for example,

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.130
if the driver went on trial for bribery,

00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:49.550
how likely is it that
he would be convicted?

00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:52.260
And, indeed, people thought
it was a near certainty

00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:55.710
when the bribe was an overt quid pro quo

00:49:55.710 --> 00:49:59.110
and succeedingly less
likely as it was veiled

00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:01.283
in thicker and thicker innuendo.

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:05.130
Prediction three is that the appeal

00:50:05.130 --> 00:50:07.900
of the direct speech should
depend on the payoff matrix.

00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:11.630
That is, speakers should
be a kind of rational actor

00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:15.469
in calibrating the
optimal level of vagueness

00:50:15.469 --> 00:50:18.824
to the payoff structure of the situation.

00:50:18.824 --> 00:50:22.630
In particular, as the model predicted,

00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:23.480
a direct bribe

00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:25.220
was rated as more attractive

00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:26.736
relative to an indirect bribe

00:50:26.736 --> 00:50:29.600
when there were fewer honest cops,

00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:31.566
that is 10% versus 90%.

00:50:31.566 --> 00:50:35.734
The fine for bribery was
lower, 250 versus $10,000.

00:50:35.734 --> 00:50:40.131
The cost of the ticket was
higher, $2,000 versus $200,

00:50:40.131 --> 00:50:43.420
or the cost of the bribe was lower, $20

00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:46.380
as the going rate to
bribe a cop versus $100.

00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:50.030
In fact, here you see
the predicted directness

00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:51.550
according to the payoff structure

00:50:51.550 --> 00:50:53.520
that we varied across scenarios.

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:56.329
And the Y axis shows the actual

00:50:56.329 --> 00:51:01.030
degree of directness that
subjects judged to be

00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:03.240
most likely in this situation.

00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:05.683
Okay, part two, relationship negotiation.

00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:08.100
Prediction is that indirect speech

00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:09.550
should be seen as more respectful

00:51:09.550 --> 00:51:11.990
and better acknowledging
the expected relationship

00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:14.610
with the hearer, namely, affection

00:51:14.610 --> 00:51:16.370
in the case of communality,

00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:18.200
deference in the case of authority,

00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:21.138
collegiality, also
communality relationship.

00:51:21.138 --> 00:51:24.530
That is, that there should
be the emotional payoff

00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:26.640
that the theory predicts.

00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:30.210
So this is in the bribe
scenario, for example.

00:51:30.210 --> 00:51:33.526
How well did Kyle convey
deference to the authority?

00:51:33.526 --> 00:51:35.976
It was judged that with overt speech,

00:51:35.976 --> 00:51:39.449
Kyle was not being differential at all.

00:51:39.449 --> 00:51:43.660
The vaguer the speech, the more deference

00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:46.014
they thought Kyle was showing
to the police officer.

00:51:46.014 --> 00:51:50.810
Likewise, how affectionate
was Michael toward Lisa?

00:51:50.810 --> 00:51:55.250
Blurting out a sexual proposition

00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:57.620
was considered to be not
particularly affectionate,

00:51:57.620 --> 00:52:00.270
whereas being very vague
was judged as considerate

00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:01.373
to her feelings.

00:52:02.550 --> 00:52:05.030
Prediction number two,
and this is a crucial one,

00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:08.590
is that just as in the case
of the dollars and sense

00:52:08.590 --> 00:52:11.383
calculation for bribing a police officer,

00:52:11.383 --> 00:52:16.167
it's critical if you take the
fairly unromantic attitude

00:52:16.167 --> 00:52:19.058
that indirect speech is a strategy

00:52:19.058 --> 00:52:21.640
that maximizes expected payoffs.

00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:25.410
It's only optimal if there
are differing thresholds

00:52:25.410 --> 00:52:28.760
between a willing hearer
and an unwilling hearer.

00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:31.240
We show that that was true
for the police officer

00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:34.770
and we had the principle of proving guilt

00:52:34.770 --> 00:52:37.780
beyond a reasonable doubt
as a kind of backup.

00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:39.630
The question is, in every day life,

00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:42.005
in social situations,
which are unregulated,

00:52:42.005 --> 00:52:45.850
do we abide by a kind of proof of guilt

00:52:45.850 --> 00:52:47.390
beyond a reasonable doubt

00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:50.440
when interpreting ambiguous propositions?

00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:54.532
In particular, imagine
two different hearers

00:52:54.532 --> 00:52:56.510
for a sexual proposition.

00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:59.060
One of whom is an unwilling seductee,

00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:02.030
she has no interest in
a sexual relationship.

00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:06.640
How explicit does a sexual
proposition have to be

00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:09.312
before she explicitly rebuffs it,

00:53:09.312 --> 00:53:14.312
versus if she wants to
reciprocate his sexual intentions,

00:53:14.555 --> 00:53:17.550
how explicit does his
proposition have to be

00:53:17.550 --> 00:53:19.341
before she accepts it?

00:53:19.341 --> 00:53:24.341
And the answer is that for a

00:53:26.047 --> 00:53:28.875
unwilling hearer to take offense,

00:53:28.875 --> 00:53:33.875
the sexual advance has
to be much more explicit

00:53:33.987 --> 00:53:38.987
than for a willing hearer
to accept the proposition.

00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:43.810
That is, an unwilling hearer

00:53:43.810 --> 00:53:46.970
gives the speaker a certain
amount of benefit of the doubt

00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:49.160
before calling on him,

00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:54.160
whereas a willing hearer will
act with a much gentler hint.

00:53:55.010 --> 00:53:57.450
And it is exactly that asymmetry

00:53:57.450 --> 00:53:59.290
that is necessary in the model

00:53:59.290 --> 00:54:02.663
for indirectness to be
the optimal strategy.

00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:05.276
Finally, and this is the
hardest part to test,

00:54:05.276 --> 00:54:08.470
that direct speech, the
proposition, the direct speech,

00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:10.490
but not indirect speech is perceived

00:54:10.490 --> 00:54:12.416
to generate common knowledge.

00:54:12.416 --> 00:54:17.416
And we tried to test
this, at least at first,

00:54:17.650 --> 00:54:19.160
in a very explicit manner

00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:23.210
by actually asking people

00:54:23.210 --> 00:54:25.670
to put themselves in the situation

00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:28.004
of say Michael and Lisa,

00:54:28.004 --> 00:54:33.004
and to assess what they would
guess about the other party's

00:54:34.810 --> 00:54:37.320
state of knowledge and the
other party's state of knowledge

00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:38.530
about their state of knowledge.

00:54:38.530 --> 00:54:40.230
And here's how we tried to do it.

00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:43.150
Since a set of nested propositions,

00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:45.270
of he knows that she knows
that he knows that she knows

00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:47.430
can make you dizzy very quickly.

00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:51.230
We tried to lead them through
to these states of knowledge

00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:53.650
in small baby steps.

00:54:53.650 --> 00:54:55.940
So put yourself in Lisa's position.

00:54:55.940 --> 00:54:59.320
What is Lisa thinking at this point

00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:01.980
following the proposition from Michael

00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:04.480
varying in degree of explicitness?

00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:07.117
We gave them a rating scale
from "I'm absolutely certain

00:55:07.117 --> 00:55:09.617
"that Michael was not
asking me to have sex/

00:55:09.617 --> 00:55:10.987
"I'm virtually certain,

00:55:10.987 --> 00:55:13.251
"I think he probably wasn't asking me.

00:55:13.251 --> 00:55:15.697
"Did he just ask me to have sex

00:55:15.697 --> 00:55:18.067
"or was he just asking
me to stay out longer?

00:55:18.067 --> 00:55:21.197
"I think he was probably
asking me to have sex.

00:55:21.197 --> 00:55:22.937
"I'm virtually certain he was asking me.

00:55:22.937 --> 00:55:24.906
"I'm absolutely certain."

00:55:24.906 --> 00:55:26.210
So that was the rating scale.

00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:30.310
Now this is for the first order hearer,

00:55:30.310 --> 00:55:34.912
namely, the hearer judging
the intention of the speaker.

00:55:34.912 --> 00:55:38.760
Second order, now imagine
that Lisa has politely said

00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:40.330
she wants to go home.

00:55:40.330 --> 00:55:42.160
Put yourself in Michael's position.

00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:43.483
What is Michael thinking now?

00:55:43.483 --> 00:55:46.330
"I'm certain that Lisa did not understand

00:55:46.330 --> 00:55:48.786
"that I was asking her for sex.

00:55:48.786 --> 00:55:51.380
"I'm absolutely certain
that she understood."

00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:53.502
And all of the gradations in between.

00:55:53.502 --> 00:55:57.920
We also asked then the state,
the second order knowledge,

00:55:57.920 --> 00:55:59.134
on the part of the hearer.

00:55:59.134 --> 00:56:02.510
Lisa knows that Michael
is asking her to have sex.

00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:04.550
Now put her, yourself, in her position.

00:56:04.550 --> 00:56:05.636
What is she thinking?

00:56:05.636 --> 00:56:07.347
"Michael thinks I didn't understand

00:56:07.347 --> 00:56:08.667
"he was asking me to have sex.

00:56:08.667 --> 00:56:10.142
"I'm absolutely certain of that."

00:56:10.142 --> 00:56:13.580
Again, with a set of statements
varying in certainty,

00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:15.747
the other end of the
continuum being "Michael knows

00:56:15.747 --> 00:56:17.847
"that I understood he was
asking me to have sex.

00:56:17.847 --> 00:56:19.390
"I'm absolutely certain of that."

00:56:19.390 --> 00:56:22.100
And through comprehension
questions after the fact,

00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:23.960
we had pretty good confidence

00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:26.170
that people were able to follow us.

00:56:26.170 --> 00:56:27.396
And we pushed our luck

00:56:27.396 --> 00:56:30.007
with the third order speaker knowledge.

00:56:30.007 --> 00:56:31.100
(audience member laughing)
Suppose that Michael

00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:34.300
does realize that Lisa knowingly
turned down his invitation

00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:35.294
to have sex.

00:56:35.294 --> 00:56:36.510
Put yourself in Michael's position.

00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:37.720
What is he thinking?

00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:38.947
One end of the continuum,

00:56:38.947 --> 00:56:40.527
"Lisa thinks that I didn't understand

00:56:40.527 --> 00:56:41.977
"that she turned me down for sex.

00:56:41.977 --> 00:56:43.155
"I'm certain of that."

00:56:43.155 --> 00:56:44.957
to, "Lisa knows that I understood

00:56:44.957 --> 00:56:46.177
"that she turned me down for sex.

00:56:46.177 --> 00:56:48.570
"I'm absolutely certain of that."

00:56:48.570 --> 00:56:51.890
And then the third order
hearer state of knowledge.

00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:54.010
Suppose Lisa is certain that Michael knows

00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:55.950
she turned down his
invitation to have sex.

00:56:55.950 --> 00:56:57.540
Put yourself in Lisa's position.

00:56:57.540 --> 00:56:58.710
What is she thinking?

00:56:58.710 --> 00:56:59.917
A set of options.

00:56:59.917 --> 00:57:02.197
"Michael understands that
I turned him down for sex.

00:57:02.197 --> 00:57:04.736
"But he doesn't realize that
I know he understands that."

00:57:04.736 --> 00:57:06.957
Other end, "Michael understands

00:57:06.957 --> 00:57:08.197
"that I turned him down for sex.

00:57:08.197 --> 00:57:11.130
"And he realizes I know
he understands that."

00:57:11.130 --> 00:57:14.240
Okay, here are the results as a function

00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:17.950
of the degree of explicitness
of the proposition.

00:57:17.950 --> 00:57:21.410
This time, however, I'm
plotting it as the parameter.

00:57:21.410 --> 00:57:23.810
Rather, that is the
difference between the lines

00:57:23.810 --> 00:57:25.510
rather than the X axis.

00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:29.236
So this line is for a
proposition that is blurted out.

00:57:29.236 --> 00:57:32.747
This one for one that is nearly overt,

00:57:32.747 --> 00:57:34.930
indirect and very vague.

00:57:34.930 --> 00:57:39.010
And on the X axis, we have
the degree of embedding

00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:40.970
of states of knowledge.

00:57:40.970 --> 00:57:43.005
That is, what did he actually mean?

00:57:43.005 --> 00:57:45.810
What does she think he means?

00:57:45.810 --> 00:57:49.870
What does he understand as
far as her understanding

00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:51.680
of what he means, and so on?

00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:53.993
For all of the indirect speech acts,

00:57:53.993 --> 00:57:57.406
the more deeply embedded
the proposition is,

00:57:57.406 --> 00:58:01.750
the less and less certain
the person imagines

00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:03.980
the actor in the scenario to be.

00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:06.530
So even if they think it's pretty likely

00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:08.260
that it was a sexual come on.

00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:10.200
They're not so sure that he thinks

00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:11.740
that she thinks that he thinks

00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:13.490
that it was sexual come on.

00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:16.225
However, when it is blurted
out in so many words,

00:58:16.225 --> 00:58:19.620
the certainty is pinned at 100%.

00:58:19.620 --> 00:58:22.390
No matter how many levels of embedding

00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:24.980
of he says that she say,
he thinks that she thinks,

00:58:24.980 --> 00:58:28.070
that he thinks that she
thinks, you throw at people,

00:58:28.070 --> 00:58:30.610
they are always confident
that everyone knows

00:58:30.610 --> 00:58:34.670
with complete certainty
that it was a sexual come on

00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:37.923
when it is said directly
but not indirectly.

00:58:39.850 --> 00:58:43.340
So to sum up, innuendo,
that is polite requests,

00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:45.620
veiled threats and bribes
and sexual overtures,

00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:48.425
poses a puzzle for psycholinguistics.

00:58:48.425 --> 00:58:50.550
And I have offered a
solution in three parts.

00:58:50.550 --> 00:58:54.010
Plausible deniability,
namely, indirect speech

00:58:54.010 --> 00:58:57.410
can minimize expected costs
in identification problems,

00:58:57.410 --> 00:59:00.069
when a speaker does not
a know a hearer's values.

00:59:00.069 --> 00:59:04.020
Relationship negotiation,
there are emotional costs

00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:06.120
to mismatched relationship types.

00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:08.090
So we seek plausible deniability

00:59:08.090 --> 00:59:09.985
when exploring relationship changes.

00:59:09.985 --> 00:59:12.150
And common knowledge,

00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:13.420
indirect speech is used

00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:16.030
even when deniability is not so plausible,

00:59:16.030 --> 00:59:18.650
because direct speech
generates common knowledge,

00:59:18.650 --> 00:59:20.306
which is the basis for coordinating

00:59:20.306 --> 00:59:21.986
relationship types.

00:59:21.986 --> 00:59:24.190
Another way of putting it is that

00:59:24.190 --> 00:59:27.500
plausible deniability of
common knowledge is possible

00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:30.000
even when plausible deniability

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.350
of the first order meaning is not.

00:59:33.350 --> 00:59:35.500
So some final thoughts
on common knowledge.

00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:36.840
I believe that innuendo

00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:40.350
is a window into a much broader world

00:59:40.350 --> 00:59:42.530
of human social interaction.

00:59:42.530 --> 00:59:44.591
That is, it's part of
a family of phenomena

00:59:44.591 --> 00:59:46.371
in which we differentiate

00:59:46.371 --> 00:59:49.500
shared knowledge from common knowledge,

00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:50.680
even though we don't, of course,

00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:53.580
have the explicit vocabulary to do so,

00:59:53.580 --> 00:59:57.001
we all tacitly sense that
there is an enormous difference

00:59:57.001 --> 00:59:59.067
between something that everyone knows

00:59:59.067 --> 01:00:02.089
and something that everyone
knows that everyone knows.

01:00:02.089 --> 01:00:04.820
And that that is, I will throw these out

01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:07.770
without explaining why, that
I think that that is behind

01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:10.950
phenomena such as hypocrisy, piety,

01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:14.770
tact, taboo, conventional wisdom,

01:00:14.770 --> 01:00:18.380
mock outrage, the
so-called Washington gaffe,

01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:21.860
which is what is the definition
of a gaffe in Washington?

01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:24.369
That's when a politician
says something that is true.

01:00:24.369 --> 01:00:25.890
(audience laughing)

01:00:25.890 --> 01:00:27.378
And political correctness.

01:00:27.378 --> 01:00:32.378
Now how could it be that so
many emotional fraught phenomena

01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:38.560
are governed by a
phenomenon, common knowledge,

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:40.920
for which we don't have an everyday name.

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:42.870
You don't have people

01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:45.220
explicitly talk about common knowledge.

01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:47.080
Well, I suggest that we do talk about it.

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:51.000
And, again, I will give a shout
out to a Berkeley linguist.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.300
George Lakoff has famously argued

01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:55.760
that much of our language is suffused with

01:00:57.350 --> 01:01:00.900
conceptual metaphors,
that is families of tropes

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:03.108
all built around a common
image, which capture

01:01:03.108 --> 01:01:07.550
a common understanding of
an abstract phenomenon.

01:01:07.550 --> 01:01:10.760
And I think we do have a
set of every day idioms

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:14.320
and figures of speech
that indirectly refer

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:16.500
to the phenomenon of common knowledge

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:21.500
by eluding to the image of a
conspicuous object or sound.

01:01:21.590 --> 01:01:24.770
And any idiom that makes such an elusion

01:01:24.770 --> 01:01:28.050
is a little indicator
that we have a tacit sense

01:01:28.050 --> 01:01:29.870
of the difference between common knowledge

01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:31.410
and shared knowledge,

01:01:31.410 --> 01:01:33.820
such as, of course, the
emperor's new clothes,

01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:38.220
phototypically, it's out there,
as in When Harry Met Sally,

01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:43.035
the cat is out of the bag,
the bell can't be unrung.

01:01:43.035 --> 01:01:46.690
Fans of Seinfeld may remember the episode

01:01:46.690 --> 01:01:50.737
in which George says to
a woman he's been dating,

01:01:50.737 --> 01:01:51.650
"I love you."

01:01:51.650 --> 01:01:52.920
And she doesn't respond.

01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:54.237
And Jerry says,

01:01:54.237 --> 01:01:57.036
"That's a pretty big matzo
ball hanging out there."

01:01:57.036 --> 01:01:58.230
(audience laughing)

01:01:58.230 --> 01:02:01.940
And, of course, the elephant in the room,

01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:03.623
the title of this lecture.

01:02:04.462 --> 01:02:07.060
And with that, I will stop
and take your questions.

01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:08.249
Thank you very much.

01:02:08.249 --> 01:02:11.416
(audience applauding)

01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:22.550
- [Andrew] Thank you,
Steve, for a wonderful talk.

01:02:22.550 --> 01:02:24.510
If you want to ask a question,

01:02:24.510 --> 01:02:25.890
I'm sure many people do,

01:02:25.890 --> 01:02:27.690
make them questions and make them brief

01:02:27.690 --> 01:02:30.050
and line up here at the mic.

01:02:30.050 --> 01:02:31.390
- [Audience Member] Do
you see any difference

01:02:31.390 --> 01:02:33.550
in indirect speech in someone who's

01:02:33.550 --> 01:02:38.483
offering a bribe as part
of soliciting a bribe

01:02:38.483 --> 01:02:43.030
for a cop who is wanting to get the $50

01:02:43.030 --> 01:02:46.251
as opposed to the motorist who

01:02:46.251 --> 01:02:50.210
isn't sure that he should give it or not.

01:02:50.210 --> 01:02:52.260
- Yes, so it is soliciting a bribe also

01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:54.344
not in indirect speech.

01:02:54.344 --> 01:02:56.280
So that we have not varied that.

01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:59.330
We haven't given people the scenario

01:02:59.330 --> 01:03:02.450
in which a corrupt
offers solicits a bribe.

01:03:02.450 --> 01:03:05.640
But I suspect that much of that

01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:08.360
is not in indirect speech
as well, anecdotally,

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:11.570
based on both on

01:03:12.462 --> 01:03:16.940
accounts that I've read
of corrupt politicians

01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:19.900
who solicit bribes,
often in indirect speech,

01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:21.600
like we're looking for contributions

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:23.679
to our campaign fund.

01:03:23.679 --> 01:03:27.970
On experiences with people
encountering bureaucrats

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:31.360
and cops in countries that
are rife with corruption,

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:32.977
that, "Would you like
to make a contribution

01:03:32.977 --> 01:03:36.326
"to the policeman's
Benevolent Association?"

01:03:36.326 --> 01:03:40.378
As opposed to, "Give
me some money or I will

01:03:40.378 --> 01:03:43.330
"make your life miserable."

01:03:43.330 --> 01:03:45.860
This is not to deny that there are cases

01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:49.370
in which bribes are actually
extorted in so many words.

01:03:49.370 --> 01:03:52.950
But I suspect that as you hinted,

01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:55.483
there's a lot of indirect
speech there as well.

01:03:58.330 --> 01:03:59.600
- [Audience Member] Thank
you for a great talk.

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:00.920
So I just wanted to ask a question

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:03.460
about the model you presented.

01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:05.940
You talked about the sort
of critical importance

01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:08.707
of that step function
versus a linear function.

01:04:08.707 --> 01:04:12.331
- Yeah, it could be--
- Sorry, not--

01:04:12.331 --> 01:04:13.164
- It could be a signal.

01:04:13.164 --> 01:04:15.292
- [Audience Member] Right, any
sort of non-linear (mumbles).

01:04:15.292 --> 01:04:16.125
And I'm just wondering--

01:04:16.125 --> 01:04:16.958
- Yeah.

01:04:16.958 --> 01:04:17.791
- [Audience Member] Just
wondering if you've thought about

01:04:17.791 --> 01:04:19.070
sort of ways you could
empirically test that

01:04:19.070 --> 01:04:21.690
if you've actually looked at
experiments that you could look

01:04:21.690 --> 01:04:24.680
for a sort of threshold
effect versus just a linear

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:25.513
or a non-linear.

01:04:25.513 --> 01:04:27.010
- Yes, you certainly could.

01:04:27.010 --> 01:04:29.853
We tried to do so.

01:04:31.150 --> 01:04:35.414
The problem is our scatter of points

01:04:35.414 --> 01:04:38.570
where plotted perceived likelihood

01:04:38.570 --> 01:04:40.690
of acting on the proposition as a bribe

01:04:40.690 --> 01:04:43.229
as a function of linguistic directness,

01:04:43.229 --> 01:04:45.193
measured independently,

01:04:48.853 --> 01:04:51.930
the points were orderly enough for us to

01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:54.520
claim with a high degree of confidence

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:56.650
that there was a non-linearity.

01:04:56.650 --> 01:04:58.230
But you're right that that would be

01:04:58.230 --> 01:04:59.460
a good test of the model.

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:01.920
And if we ran 10 times as many subjects,

01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:06.690
and had many more levels of indirectness

01:05:06.690 --> 01:05:10.710
between naked bribe and innocent remark,

01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:12.160
we'd be in a position to test that.

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:14.560
But, yes, absolutely,
that would be a good test.

01:05:17.210 --> 01:05:22.176
- [Audience Member] I've seen
some studies that point to

01:05:22.176 --> 01:05:25.288
creativity as being

01:05:25.288 --> 01:05:28.664
related with dishonesty.

01:05:28.664 --> 01:05:31.070
So, in other words, people who are

01:05:31.070 --> 01:05:35.380
primed to be dishonest tend
to find creative solutions

01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:37.840
to a problem more easily.

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:41.100
And I was wondering if

01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:42.590
there might be a similar relationship

01:05:42.590 --> 01:05:46.560
with tendency to use innuendo
versus direct speech.

01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:48.990
And sort of as a follow on to that,

01:05:48.990 --> 01:05:52.801
whether innuendo might...

01:05:52.801 --> 01:05:55.850
I haven't really got my
head around the problem yet,

01:05:55.850 --> 01:05:59.030
but I'm just wondering
whether it would lead to

01:05:59.030 --> 01:06:01.830
a feeling of greater cognitive ease

01:06:01.830 --> 01:06:04.160
or greater cognitive strain.

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:06.110
I'm thinking cognitive
ease, but I don't know.

01:06:06.110 --> 01:06:09.840
- Yes, no, I think those
are insightful observations.

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:11.920
In every day life, we often have a feeling

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:16.690
in making judgements about
individual differences,

01:06:16.690 --> 01:06:19.042
that there's a kind of person who is

01:06:19.042 --> 01:06:21.600
perhaps a master at indirect speech.

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:24.820
At one extreme they can be seen as slick

01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:28.040
or fast talking or oleaginous.

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:32.163
And we distrust someone
who's slick, too unctuous,

01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:37.803
too fulsome, where you never
know what they're thinking.

01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:43.070
One step short of that, we
value someone who is tactful,

01:06:43.070 --> 01:06:45.990
which I interpret as
keeping fraught propositions

01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:47.770
out of common knowledge.

01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:51.270
The distinction between being tactful

01:06:51.270 --> 01:06:56.270
and being unctuous or
slick is often a fine one.

01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:59.110
Then at the other end, we

01:07:01.210 --> 01:07:05.020
sometimes denigrate
people who are too blunt.

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:09.000
They can come off as boorish or uncultured

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.480
or tactless.

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:12.350
But then we can also value someone

01:07:12.350 --> 01:07:14.140
who's kind of plain speaking,

01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:16.832
who can, at least in some circumstances,

01:07:16.832 --> 01:07:18.653
just get to the point.

01:07:19.550 --> 01:07:21.950
And as you note in the
second part of your question,

01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:23.610
there can be a lot of cognitive work

01:07:23.610 --> 01:07:25.580
when we figure, "What did
he really mean by that?"

01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:26.797
and you go home just wondering,

01:07:26.797 --> 01:07:28.710
"Well, how should I interpret that?"

01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:30.890
Which is a kind of imposition,

01:07:30.890 --> 01:07:33.666
a kind of lack of consideration.

01:07:33.666 --> 01:07:37.550
I sense, and I think
you can all confirm this

01:07:37.550 --> 01:07:41.250
that a lot of our gossip of
what kind of a person someone is

01:07:41.250 --> 01:07:43.630
is often how they fit

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:45.800
along those two dimensions.

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:50.800
Do they have an optimal degree
of tact without being slick?

01:07:51.483 --> 01:07:55.910
Do they have a refreshing
directness without being insulting

01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:57.600
and boorish?

01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:00.930
And I bet a content analysis
of a lot of our conversation

01:08:00.930 --> 01:08:05.930
would show us pinning
people in that space.

01:08:06.682 --> 01:08:09.360
- [Audience Member] Yeah, I just think

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:11.890
sort of a direction for
future research might be

01:08:13.329 --> 01:08:15.918
trying to pinpoint sort of an optimal

01:08:15.918 --> 01:08:18.549
number of levels of ambiguity

01:08:18.549 --> 01:08:21.270
for, yeah, anyway.

01:08:21.270 --> 01:08:23.240
- Absolutely, and I think people,

01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:24.760
here's another everyday concept

01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:25.593
that I think relates to that,

01:08:25.593 --> 01:08:26.440
is when we talk about someone

01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:31.440
who's being socially skilled
versus graceless clumsy,

01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:34.160
I think a lot of it is
finding the optimum degree

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:37.419
of indirectness so that
a message gets across

01:08:37.419 --> 01:08:40.154
without anyone's feelings being hurt,

01:08:40.154 --> 01:08:41.640
without their, as we say,

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:42.760
their feathers being ruffled,

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:45.030
their nose being put out of joint.

01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:47.670
And because in social
life you can't get away,

01:08:47.670 --> 01:08:49.370
you know, we can't all

01:08:51.070 --> 01:08:53.000
cooperate perfectly on everything.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.750
There are inherent conflicts of interest

01:08:54.750 --> 01:08:57.180
in running any organization,
or for that matter,

01:08:57.180 --> 01:09:00.050
family, friendship, romantic partnership.

01:09:00.050 --> 01:09:02.850
And being able to
negotiate those conflicts

01:09:02.850 --> 01:09:05.080
without challenging the relationship

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:08.100
that is, say, treating someone as a peon

01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:09.340
when they should be your peer.

01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:12.390
But you still really have to
direct them to do something.

01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:15.780
Or challenge someone while making it clear

01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:18.048
you're still their friend,
you still love them.

01:09:18.048 --> 01:09:23.048
That's the very stuff of
dealing with relationships.

01:09:23.150 --> 01:09:25.420
And I think the socially
skilled person is the one

01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:27.583
who finds that optimal level.

01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:30.100
- [Audience Member] Thank you very much

01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:31.870
for a very interesting talk.

01:09:31.870 --> 01:09:33.490
Well, I have a very short question

01:09:33.490 --> 01:09:36.360
concerning all the seduction
scenario you were talking about

01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:37.370
in your lecture.

01:09:37.370 --> 01:09:40.790
So in linguistics we know
that euphemisms are used

01:09:40.790 --> 01:09:43.321
when there is a taboo for something.

01:09:43.321 --> 01:09:45.610
So there is a concept that is
perceived as being unpleasant.

01:09:45.610 --> 01:09:48.840
And we know that sexuality
is obviously a taboo concept.

01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:51.470
So my question is do we
actually have a choice

01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:53.410
between directness and indirectness

01:09:53.410 --> 01:09:55.410
in that seduction scenario?

01:09:55.410 --> 01:09:58.089
We can, of course, be pretty direct,

01:09:58.089 --> 01:09:59.360
but this will create the
impression that we are not

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:03.390
well brought-up or not
brought up in a proper manner.

01:10:03.390 --> 01:10:05.390
Yeah, how will you relate this well

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:09.000
to your theory of the
decision between directness

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:09.833
and indirectness.

01:10:09.833 --> 01:10:11.324
- Well, I think that that's right.

01:10:11.324 --> 01:10:14.670
What in effect I've been trying to do

01:10:14.670 --> 01:10:17.850
is to come up with a theory
of what taboo really is,

01:10:17.850 --> 01:10:21.460
why you do have the impression
that someone is better

01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:25.700
brought up if they find the
right level of indirectness

01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:27.610
instead of just blurting everything out.

01:10:27.610 --> 01:10:28.800
And it's not mandatory.

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:31.960
There are people, I suspect
there are people in this room

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:34.207
who've had the experience of
someone just blurting out,

01:10:34.207 --> 01:10:36.127
"You know, I find you really attractive.

01:10:36.127 --> 01:10:37.599
"Do you wanna have sex?"

01:10:37.599 --> 01:10:41.670
which I've read interviews with authors

01:10:41.670 --> 01:10:43.390
who are famous for just trying it.

01:10:43.390 --> 01:10:47.790
And if they get rejected
19 times out of 20,

01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:50.300
well, it's worth it to score on the 20th.

01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:52.380
And so if they have a thick enough skin

01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:53.880
to withstand the rejection

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:57.990
and the offense because it's worth it,

01:10:57.990 --> 01:11:00.670
then they really do opt
for more direct speech.

01:11:00.670 --> 01:11:02.758
And then on the other end,

01:11:02.758 --> 01:11:04.990
again, I'm gonna appeal to Seinfeld,

01:11:04.990 --> 01:11:08.130
not 'cause I'm a Seinfeld fanboy, per se,

01:11:08.130 --> 01:11:11.960
but because romantic comedies
and situation comedies

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:15.000
are often driven by exactly
these sorts of conflicts.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.130
But in the other
direction, from the author

01:11:17.130 --> 01:11:19.130
who just blurts it out every time

01:11:19.130 --> 01:11:20.920
with a thick skin for rejection,

01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:23.437
you got a scene where George Constanza

01:11:23.437 --> 01:11:25.247
is asked by his date
at the end of the date,

01:11:25.247 --> 01:11:26.780
"Would you like to come up for coffee?"

01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:28.197
And he says, "Oh, no, I have to be at work

01:11:28.197 --> 01:11:30.400
"at nine in the morning and
caffeine would keep me up."

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:32.097
And then walking away he says,

01:11:32.097 --> 01:11:33.827
"Oh, my God, coffee doesn't mean coffee.

01:11:33.827 --> 01:11:35.407
"Coffee means sex."

01:11:35.407 --> 01:11:36.873
(audience laughing)

01:11:36.873 --> 01:11:39.341
So that's the danger
with being too indirect.

01:11:39.341 --> 01:11:43.130
So I think there is, there
still exists that range.

01:11:43.130 --> 01:11:47.690
And I think most people do
find some intermediate point.

01:11:47.690 --> 01:11:50.060
But that is a range of options

01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:51.623
that is available to people.

01:11:56.609 --> 01:11:57.500
- [Audience Member] Hi, whoo.

01:11:57.500 --> 01:12:01.300
Hi, so I'm wondering if there are,

01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:04.470
if you've identified any linguistic cues

01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:06.320
for kind of the opposite.

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:09.470
As opposed to understanding

01:12:09.470 --> 01:12:12.780
indirect speech, what if someone is

01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:16.780
trying to be direct but
then they are misunderstood

01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:21.680
as having tried to convey
an innuendo or a euphemism.

01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:26.680
And what factors might cause
the hearer to think that,

01:12:28.650 --> 01:12:31.287
factors within the speakers speech?

01:12:31.287 --> 01:12:35.870
- Yes, well, our data suggests
that when you're direct,

01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:37.660
at least by our definition of directness,

01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:39.812
which we confirmed with ratings by

01:12:39.812 --> 01:12:42.215
separate groups of subjects.

01:12:42.215 --> 01:12:45.750
Almost my by definition,
direct leaves very little room

01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:47.140
to the imagination.

01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:48.360
Now there are...

01:12:49.551 --> 01:12:53.010
There are cases and they're
also subject to comedy

01:12:53.010 --> 01:12:54.620
where you've got the really dense person

01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:57.550
who doesn't understand something
that's even very obvious.

01:12:57.550 --> 01:12:59.330
There's the joke about
the two psychiatrist.

01:12:59.330 --> 01:13:01.200
And one of them says to the
other, "Have a nice day."

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:03.855
and the other things, "I
wonder what he meant by that?"

01:13:03.855 --> 01:13:04.688
(audience laughing)

01:13:04.688 --> 01:13:05.887
Or, "Do you wanna come up and have sex?"

01:13:05.887 --> 01:13:07.920
"Oh, what could he possibly mean?"

01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:09.180
So I think those are the subject

01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:10.470
of another kind of comedy.

01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:13.210
But, generally, directness
is harder to misinterpret.

01:13:13.210 --> 01:13:15.110
- Can I clarify a little bit?
- You've got an example?

01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:17.448
- [Audience Member] Like,
for example, in a situation

01:13:17.448 --> 01:13:21.410
where you, well, okay.

01:13:21.410 --> 01:13:25.370
So in the situation where

01:13:25.370 --> 01:13:30.370
it's very common for women to say, "No."

01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:33.920
to sexual overtures, but it's interpreted

01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:36.630
as being playing hard to get.

01:13:36.630 --> 01:13:38.430
Thank kind of thing.
- Oh, I see.

01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:39.650
What part of no don't you--
- So it's like this idea

01:13:39.650 --> 01:13:42.452
of that, you're like
playing a game or something.

01:13:42.452 --> 01:13:47.040
Or for someone to say, like,

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:51.950
"I want to be friends with you."

01:13:51.950 --> 01:13:53.197
And that being like,

01:13:53.197 --> 01:13:56.905
"Oh, she wants to get friendly with me."

01:13:56.905 --> 01:13:58.060
(audience laughing)
- That's right

01:13:58.060 --> 01:13:58.893
No, that's true.

01:13:58.893 --> 01:14:01.220
And that actually is a
significant phenomenon in

01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:07.390
cases of sexual harassment of
acquaintance rape and so on.

01:14:07.390 --> 01:14:09.050
And in workplace policies.

01:14:09.050 --> 01:14:13.290
A few years ago, I remember
Safeway supermarkets,

01:14:13.290 --> 01:14:17.770
instructed their cashiers,
with every customer

01:14:17.770 --> 01:14:19.837
look them in the eye and smile,

01:14:19.837 --> 01:14:21.840
as a way of making Safeway seem to be

01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:22.890
a nice, friendly place.

01:14:22.890 --> 01:14:24.910
And they had to abandon that policy,

01:14:24.910 --> 01:14:27.800
because the male
customers interpreted that

01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:29.177
as a sexual come on
(audience laughing)

01:14:29.177 --> 01:14:32.000
by the female cashiers.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.720
And there are lots of
data that the threshold,

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:37.840
there's a whole sexual
asymmetry in sexual come ons

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:42.840
that the way a male reacts
to a female proposition

01:14:43.830 --> 01:14:47.620
and vice versa show enormous asymmetries.

01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:49.230
And you're right that there can be,

01:14:49.230 --> 01:14:50.317
and because of things like,

01:14:50.317 --> 01:14:52.211
"What part of no don't you understand?"

01:14:52.211 --> 01:14:54.870
The threshold can be...

01:14:54.870 --> 01:14:56.890
So that would be a good example.

01:14:56.890 --> 01:14:58.642
The threshold can be

01:14:58.642 --> 01:15:01.770
set so far to the right that

01:15:01.770 --> 01:15:05.010
that would be a case, indeed,
that where direct speech

01:15:05.010 --> 01:15:07.150
is interpreted as a indirect speech.

01:15:07.150 --> 01:15:10.330
And, presumably, this
would be explained, again,

01:15:10.330 --> 01:15:15.330
by the payoff matrix
for a man for whom sex

01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:18.900
has such a high payoff
and being turned down

01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:22.970
has such a low cast,
then the optimum cutoff

01:15:22.970 --> 01:15:27.500
could be one in which nothing
short of physical resistance

01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:31.210
would be interpreted as a genuine no.

01:15:31.210 --> 01:15:33.368
So, yeah, that's a great example.

01:15:33.368 --> 01:15:35.840
- [Audience Member] Thank you.

01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:37.625
- [Audience Member] My question
is a little bit related.

01:15:37.625 --> 01:15:39.900
It seems like a lot of these scenarios

01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:43.670
could be interpreted, in some cases,

01:15:43.670 --> 01:15:46.323
as being part of a broader
bargaining scenario.

01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:51.260
And I was wondering have you, do you

01:15:52.096 --> 01:15:56.080
also look into sort of
at what point people

01:15:56.080 --> 01:16:00.580
perceive something as
part of a negotiation.

01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:03.673
And at what point it's simply a yes or no?

01:16:04.590 --> 01:16:08.793
- No, I think that these are
(mumbles) of negotiation.

01:16:10.504 --> 01:16:12.254
And in negotiation...

01:16:14.025 --> 01:16:15.940
Negotiation is a coordination problem

01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:19.820
in the sense that there is
a often a range of solutions

01:16:19.820 --> 01:16:23.220
that would leave both sides better off

01:16:23.220 --> 01:16:24.880
than if they walked away from the deal

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:27.600
and each one wants to
find the optimal point

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.220
within that range of solutions.

01:16:29.220 --> 01:16:32.720
And, often, common knowledge
of a salient solution

01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:37.720
is essential to consummating
an effect of negotiation.

01:16:38.601 --> 01:16:42.350
And so that range of
intermediate positions

01:16:42.350 --> 01:16:45.670
is usually what is being
explored in a negotiation.

01:16:45.670 --> 01:16:48.740
And I think that's true of
a negotiating a relationship

01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:50.819
as well as negotiating a price.

01:16:50.819 --> 01:16:52.000
So, yeah.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.472
- [Audience Member] Thank you.

01:16:53.472 --> 01:16:55.167
- [Audience Member]
Thanks for a great talk.

01:16:55.167 --> 01:16:57.450
So, two things.

01:16:57.450 --> 01:16:59.720
First, I wanted to
thank you for explaining

01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:02.368
my lack of success with American women.

01:17:02.368 --> 01:17:04.990
(Steven and audience laughing)

01:17:04.990 --> 01:17:08.690
Secondly, I thought it
was interesting that...

01:17:08.690 --> 01:17:11.940
So you primarily you focused
on the cost and benefits

01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:16.940
to the speaker of making shared
knowledge common knowledge.

01:17:17.209 --> 01:17:20.720
And it seems like there's
an interesting angle

01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:22.600
to looking at the same thing

01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:24.930
from the perspective of the hearer.

01:17:24.930 --> 01:17:26.640
And just to give an example that, say,

01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:29.294
in the case of the corrupt police officer,

01:17:29.294 --> 01:17:32.460
there may be costs to the police officer

01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:35.120
of explicitly appearing corrupt.

01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:37.510
In the sense, for example,
the police officer

01:17:37.510 --> 01:17:40.830
may be subject to disciplinary sanctions

01:17:40.830 --> 01:17:43.511
if it's clear in the transaction,

01:17:43.511 --> 01:17:45.830
the police officer is corrupt.

01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:47.710
And then, I guess, similarly in the case

01:17:47.710 --> 01:17:52.710
of the dating scenario, the women's morals

01:17:52.890 --> 01:17:54.860
may be called into question.

01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:59.540
If it's explicit that she easily accepts

01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:01.440
the sexual invitation,

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:03.480
so I'm just curious if
you've looked at that

01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:05.340
cost-benefit equation

01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:09.200
from the perspective of the
hearer as well as the speaker.

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:11.180
- Yes, although not experimentally.

01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:14.910
But I do explore exactly
that question in my book

01:18:14.910 --> 01:18:16.370
The Stuff of Thought, from which

01:18:16.370 --> 01:18:18.140
a lot of this material is taken.

01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:23.110
And, indeed, a fact that I just threw out

01:18:23.110 --> 01:18:25.130
without a lot of justification,

01:18:25.130 --> 01:18:27.010
namely that there are different thresholds

01:18:27.010 --> 01:18:29.200
for the speaker and the hearer

01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:32.020
as to how direct the proposition has to be

01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:32.853
before they'll act on it.

01:18:32.853 --> 01:18:34.370
Would itself need an explanation?

01:18:34.370 --> 01:18:36.465
And, indeed, the explanation would

01:18:36.465 --> 01:18:37.815
come form the payoff matrix

01:18:39.996 --> 01:18:40.829
for the hearer.

01:18:40.829 --> 01:18:42.520
That is, what are the
costs, the potential costs,

01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:46.150
of accepting versus turning
down the proposition.

01:18:46.150 --> 01:18:49.530
And because those
payoffs will be different

01:18:49.530 --> 01:18:52.490
for the hearer then for the
speaker, that would result

01:18:52.490 --> 01:18:54.240
in the threshold for action,

01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:55.400
showing the discrepancy

01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:57.080
that is absolutely necessary

01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:00.320
for indirect speech to be selected.

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:02.491
That's probably why in cases where

01:19:02.491 --> 01:19:05.510
the payoffs are pretty much identical

01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:07.310
for speaker and hearer.

01:19:07.310 --> 01:19:10.120
That's when it's just fine
to kinda blurt it out.

01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:13.990
You don't need a lot of indirect speech

01:19:13.990 --> 01:19:15.400
and beating around the bush

01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:17.970
in a married couple, when it comes to sex,

01:19:17.970 --> 01:19:21.854
in a business transaction where

01:19:21.854 --> 01:19:25.330
you're actually buying
something from a vendor

01:19:25.330 --> 01:19:28.930
where everyone benefits to a known degree

01:19:28.930 --> 01:19:33.330
by the transaction,
then you don't have that

01:19:33.330 --> 01:19:36.650
slippage between the two sets of interests

01:19:36.650 --> 01:19:40.490
that define the zone in which
indirectness is optimal.

01:19:40.490 --> 01:19:42.423
Yes, that's absolutely right.

01:19:42.423 --> 01:19:43.256
And for the...

01:19:44.254 --> 01:19:47.020
There's the built-in
asymmetry of male sexuality

01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:48.190
and female sexuality.

01:19:48.190 --> 01:19:51.790
In fact, the extreme case
is the famous experiment

01:19:51.790 --> 01:19:55.040
by Elaine Hatfield in which she...

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:56.920
This is actually a wonderful experiment on

01:19:56.920 --> 01:20:00.500
direct speech where she hired confederates

01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:02.630
to walk around campus,

01:20:02.630 --> 01:20:04.750
select a member of the opposite sex

01:20:04.750 --> 01:20:07.757
and say, "Would you like to
have sex with me tonight?"

01:20:08.718 --> 01:20:12.890
And what she found was that
75% of the men said yes.

01:20:12.890 --> 01:20:16.301
And 0% of the women said yes.

01:20:16.301 --> 01:20:17.302
(audience laughing)

01:20:17.302 --> 01:20:22.302
And I think there are perfectly
well-supported explanations

01:20:22.340 --> 01:20:25.970
from evolutionary psychology
on why that should be true.

01:20:25.970 --> 01:20:27.240
So there's that.

01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:29.390
And that's, by the way,
one of the reasons why

01:20:29.390 --> 01:20:33.330
I didn't make any of these
scenarios gender neutral.

01:20:33.330 --> 01:20:36.064
When it comes to sexuality
it's just not gender neutral.

01:20:36.064 --> 01:20:38.950
But, in addition, there
are probably some payoffs

01:20:38.950 --> 01:20:42.430
that are inherently symmetrical

01:20:42.430 --> 01:20:46.040
on two sides, such as if, on either side,

01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:47.360
if you are rebuffed,

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:52.360
that is a kind of denigration
of your attractiveness

01:20:52.376 --> 01:20:53.209
and that works for both,

01:20:53.209 --> 01:20:55.370
superimposed on a male/female difference,

01:20:55.370 --> 01:20:56.730
that's an aspect that's the same

01:20:56.730 --> 01:20:57.620
for male and female,

01:20:57.620 --> 01:20:59.870
that kind of pride insulting.

01:20:59.870 --> 01:21:01.860
And there are other aspects

01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:04.440
that could be more or less symmetrical.

01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:05.500
- [Audience Member] Yeah, thanks.

01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:08.089
Or, I guess you could say, in other words,

01:21:08.089 --> 01:21:10.177
the type of relationship to some degree

01:21:10.177 --> 01:21:12.110
dictates whether the speaker

01:21:12.110 --> 01:21:14.500
needs to take into consideration

01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:18.410
the cost benefits of the
hearer as well as their own.

01:21:18.410 --> 01:21:20.063
- Yes, very much so, yeah.

01:21:23.330 --> 01:21:26.340
- [Audience Member] Hi, my
question was kind of related.

01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:30.550
So your example, most of
your examples in this talk,

01:21:30.550 --> 01:21:33.640
have been about the
initial sort of overture,

01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:37.010
the initial question, like
the veiled offer of a bribe,

01:21:37.010 --> 01:21:39.500
or the veiled offer of sex.

01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:43.610
But if you, encounter a corrupt cop

01:21:43.610 --> 01:21:47.870
or a willing sexual partner,
it eventually has to like

01:21:48.731 --> 01:21:50.060
cross those degrees of indirectness

01:21:50.060 --> 01:21:52.760
up to the point where you
actually hand over the 50

01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:54.730
or actually have sex.

01:21:54.730 --> 01:21:57.370
So I was wondering if you
had conducted research

01:21:57.370 --> 01:22:01.080
or were planning to
conduct research on how

01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:06.080
and under what conditions that
step up of ambiguity reaches

01:22:06.930 --> 01:22:08.640
the level of full directness.

01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:13.512
- Yes, and we do discuss that scenario,

01:22:13.512 --> 01:22:17.308
Martin and James and I in our PNAS paper

01:22:17.308 --> 01:22:20.900
although we never designed
an experiment around it.

01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:23.900
But, yes, one other
strategy, which is in fact,

01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:25.850
as you suggest, more realistic

01:22:25.850 --> 01:22:30.520
than you throw at a proposition
gambling on how your

01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:32.010
speaker will react to it,

01:22:32.010 --> 01:22:33.460
giving it your best shot.

01:22:33.460 --> 01:22:36.177
Is that you could escalate
the degree of directness.

01:22:36.177 --> 01:22:38.319
"Gee, officer, isn't it a nice day?

01:22:38.319 --> 01:22:41.447
"Gee, I guess you do have a
problem with speeders here.

01:22:41.447 --> 01:22:45.738
"I can understand how you'd
be concerned about this.

01:22:45.738 --> 01:22:49.166
"I've heard that policemen
have Benevolent Association.

01:22:49.166 --> 01:22:50.787
"How is doing lately?"

01:22:50.787 --> 01:22:54.270
(audience laughing)
You could up and up and up it.

01:22:54.270 --> 01:22:56.600
And, likewise, I don't even
have to play it out for you

01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:59.601
what it would be like
in a seduction scenario,

01:22:59.601 --> 01:23:01.750
likewise in a threat scenario.

01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:06.340
And that way the speaker
could calibrate the degree,

01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:08.780
could sort of titrate
the degree of directness

01:23:08.780 --> 01:23:12.520
until they get the first
signs of a rejection

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:14.740
or the deal is consummated.

01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:16.560
And I agree with you that in real life,

01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:20.860
that incremental strategy,
moving your way up the line

01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:23.420
of explicitness may even be more common

01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:26.190
than throwing out your best guess

01:23:26.190 --> 01:23:27.653
as a one-shot offer.

01:23:29.010 --> 01:23:29.843
- [Audience Member] With respect to

01:23:29.843 --> 01:23:32.553
the interests of the hearer,

01:23:32.553 --> 01:23:36.490
a corrupt cop might
want to accept a bribe,

01:23:36.490 --> 01:23:40.170
but might test out and just
make it a little bit more

01:23:40.170 --> 01:23:41.790
explicit than the offer of the bribe,

01:23:41.790 --> 01:23:44.280
waiting for them to offer
an even more explicit bribe

01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:46.460
so that at every given point,

01:23:46.460 --> 01:23:49.180
the level of ambiguity's
comfortable for everyone.

01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:50.550
Is that kind of--

01:23:50.550 --> 01:23:52.550
- Absolutely, yes, so it could be.

01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:54.070
And because as in response

01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:55.220
to an earlier question I mentioned

01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:58.536
that soliciting a bribe
also uses indirectness

01:23:58.536 --> 01:24:01.891
and, indeed, that could be
done incrementally as well.

01:24:01.891 --> 01:24:04.850
And so you could have,
and I suspect, again,

01:24:04.850 --> 01:24:07.510
probably a lot of romantic
comedies explore this

01:24:07.510 --> 01:24:08.930
in the sexual case.

01:24:08.930 --> 01:24:12.754
Probably a set of potentially escalating

01:24:12.754 --> 01:24:15.810
propositions in both
directions could at some point

01:24:15.810 --> 01:24:17.356
meet in the middle.

01:24:17.356 --> 01:24:22.010
I think much ado about nothing,
the sexually charged banter

01:24:22.010 --> 01:24:23.693
has much of that character,

01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:29.853
also in Henry V, the (speaks a
foreign language) at the end.

01:24:31.033 --> 01:24:34.887
- [Andrew] So let's thank
Steve, again, for a great talk.

01:24:34.887 --> 01:24:36.777
(audience applauding)
- Thank you very much.

01:24:36.777 --> 01:24:37.610
Thank you.

01:24:44.065 --> 01:24:47.565
(gentle thoughtful music)
