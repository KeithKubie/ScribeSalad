JASON SILVA: So Kevin Kelly, the
co-founder of Wired Magazine,

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.470
has this wonderful idea about
how the emergence of language

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.570
was actually the first
singularity, right?

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.110
In other words, the world on
the other side of that line,

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.865
after language
emerged, would have

00:00:30.865 --> 00:00:33.250
been unimaginable
to the creatures

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.660
standing on the previous, on the
other side of that line, right?

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.080
Trying to explain the nuances
of a Shakespearean sonnet,

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.380
to an ape, are
simply unimaginable.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.880
Right?

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.340
This is inconceivable, we simply
lacked the wetware, right?

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.030
So language.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.350
What is language?

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.810
Kevin Kelly says
it's a tool that

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.140
allows the mind to know
what it's thinking, right?

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.070
It turned a feral
mind into a tool

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.470
that could now think with
purpose and deliberation,

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.120
right?

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.960
Language allowed us to create
a virtual world in our heads,

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.190
and pull the present
forward to meet that.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.130
The ability to design, to
envision, to plan, to imagineer

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.050
was the natural consequence
to the emergence of language.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.430
Again, a tool that
allows the mind

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.560
to know what it's
thinking, right?

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.440
Language has to
do with sentience,

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.510
before language, there
was no self-awareness,

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.150
there was no self
consciousness, right?

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.330
Language came about as a kind
of vortex of self-mirroring.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.090
Right?

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.300
Language and
self-awareness is kind of

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.650
like plugging a video
camera into the TV,

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.560
aiming it at the TV, and then
seeing the engulfing infinity,

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.070
right?

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.560
The recursive infinity
loop that gets

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.170
formed, and-- and,
I don't know, I

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.545
find that idea to
be astonishing.

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:55.795
And when you really think
of how it transformed

00:01:55.795 --> 00:01:58.870
the mental operating
system, right, you

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.200
can see why Kelly would call
it the first singularity.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.700
Language.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.750
