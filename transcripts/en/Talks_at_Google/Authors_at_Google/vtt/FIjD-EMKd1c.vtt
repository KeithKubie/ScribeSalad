[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.868 --> 00:00:10.269
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.300
ARI WEINZWEIG: What's
a non-Google welcome?

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.130
DOMINIQUE EHRL: Well, first we
have to ask you a icebreaker.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.609
And then it'll officially
be a Google welcome.

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:21.150
So Ari, could you
please start us out

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.420
with what is the secret
to a great sandwich?

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.670
ARI WEINZWEIG: Well, I don't
think there's any secret.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.660
I think everybody
knows the secrets.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.380
It's just you start with
really good ingredients.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.630
It's just most people
don't want to pay to buy

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.740
really great ingredients.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.270
They want to use
average ingredients,

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.260
and it's impossible to make
something great out of average.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.190
So I think that would
be a really good start.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.190
DOMINIQUE EHRL: Awesome.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.101
Thank you for that.

00:00:45.101 --> 00:00:45.600
All right.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.100
Great.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.980
So can you please go ahead and
take us off with who was Ari

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.360
before Zingerman's?

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.410
What's your story?

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.070
And how did this amazing
Ann Arbor infamous deli

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.630
come to be what we
know of it as today?

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.490
ARI WEINZWEIG: Well, it's
a lot more than a deli.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.230
How did it-- I guess I'm the
same person I always have been.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.590
I think we just evolve.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.470
In the same way Ann
Arbor is the same town

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.460
as it was 100 years ago--
it just grows and evolves.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.760
And it's not a one-night,
overnight, change.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.230
It's just you continue to learn.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.390
But anyway, I'm from Chicago.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.610
I grew up there, came
up here to go to school.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.670
I went to U of M,
studied Russian history,

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.076
studied the anarchists.

00:01:28.076 --> 00:01:30.450
Most of you don't know, but
we have the largest anarchist

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.533
collection in the country.

00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:34.356
It is on the seventh and eighth
floor of the graduate library.

00:01:34.356 --> 00:01:36.480
If they let you out of work
you could go down there

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.360
and check it out.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.360
After graduating, I had no clue
what I was going to do next.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.070
I mostly just didn't
want to go home.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.840
In order to not go
home, I needed a job.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.900
I'd driven a cab while I
was in school part-time.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.280
That wasn't all that much fun.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.157
One of my roommates was waiting
tables in a restaurant at

00:01:53.157 --> 00:01:54.240
I don't know what it was--

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.370
Fourth and Liberty--
that's not there anymore.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.590
And I went in there looking
for a job as a server.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.510
And they told me they'd
call me if something opened.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.593
And I waited two weeks,
and they hadn't called me.

00:02:02.593 --> 00:02:04.732
So I went back, and I
reapplied as a busser.

00:02:04.732 --> 00:02:05.940
And they said they'd call me.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.170
And I waited two more weeks.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.000
And they hadn't called
me, so I went back

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.380
and offered to do anything.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.240
And they asked if I
wanted to wash dishes.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.110
And I said, sure.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.520
And that's how I got started.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.760
So I wish I could tell
you some wonderfully

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.770
glamorous, entrepreneurial
story of a childhood filled

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.260
with great food, and my
mother was an amazing cook,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.059
and I knew from
the time I was 10 I

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:28.350
was going to have my own place.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.150
But none of that
is true whatsoever.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.390
My mother was a good
person but not a good cook.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.120
And I grew up on--

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.220
I always say it's
the mid-20th century,

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.050
but I think they
still sell it all--

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.220
Kraft macaroni and cheese, Mrs.
Paul's fish sticks, Pop Tarts,

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.520
Tang, Nestle Quik,
Cocoa Krispies,

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.600
Cocoa Puffs-- all that stuff.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.440
So I had zero culinary
upbringing whatsoever.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.020
And really, no one in my
family was in business.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.360
They were all teachers,
doctors, lawyers, psychologists,

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.860
dentists.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.730
So I was the total
failure of the family

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.750
for not getting an
advanced degree.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.470
And in hindsight, I have more
empathy for my mother's angst

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.660
after I had four years
of out-of-state tuition

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.840
at Michigan and then got
a job as a dishwasher.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.575
But anyway, so that's
how I got started.

00:03:16.575 --> 00:03:17.950
I just really got
lucky because I

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.340
stumbled into work that I really
loved and into great people.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.770
So Paul Saginaw, who's
been my partner in all this

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.670
from the get-go, was the general
manager at that restaurant.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.400
Frank Carollo, who's one of the
partners at our bakery, where

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.200
all those things
that you, I think--

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.213
are you eating all
those pastries?

00:03:34.213 --> 00:03:35.570
AUDIENCE: They might be gone.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:36.250
ARI WEINZWEIG:
They might be gone.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.850
Are they gone?

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:37.870
AUDIENCE: [INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.286
ARI WEINZWEIG: So
one thing is you

00:03:39.286 --> 00:03:41.320
can keep eating while I talk.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.420
Because my whole day is
spent talking to people

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.500
that are eating, and it makes
me nervous if you're not eating.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.240
Because, well, it's
a sign that we're

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.450
headed to go out of business.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.434
So anyway, and then
Maggie Bayless,

00:03:53.434 --> 00:03:55.600
who's one of the partners
at ZingTrain, our training

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.120
business, who, actually, I
was just talking to on the way

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.650
here, was a cocktail waitress.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.910
So I don't know why we're
all in there together,

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.910
but we've now known each
other probably twice as

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.740
long as a lot of you
all have been alive.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.760
And that's a really
good problem to have.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.580
And I feel fortunate for that.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.590
So Frank started teaching me how
to prep and how to line cook.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.190
And I started managing
kitchens, and I

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.100
worked for that restaurant
group for about four years.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.720
Paul left about
halfway through that

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.339
and opened Monahan's
Seafood Market,

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:22.990
which, if you don't
know it, is still

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.530
one of the best fish markets in
the country, over in Kerrytown.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.000
And fall of '81, I reached
a point, which is not

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.730
uncommon in the
world, where it's not

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.400
like I hated going to work, and
they were not a bad company,

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.740
but I was just sort
of less and less

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.720
inspired by what I was doing.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.480
And I could sense more and
more clearly every week

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.120
that where they were
headed organizationally,

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.717
with food philosophy and
leadership philosophy,

00:04:48.717 --> 00:04:50.050
were not where I wanted to head.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.510
So I just decided I was going
to give two months' notice.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.230
I didn't know what was next.

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.150
And Paul called
me two days later.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.400
And he said that there was
this little building coming

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.920
open near the fish market.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.392
How many people have
been to the deli?

00:05:02.392 --> 00:05:03.100
Almost everybody.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.142
OK, so he had grown
up in Detroit, where

00:05:07.142 --> 00:05:08.350
you could get good deli food.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.330
And in Chicago,
you could get it,

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.570
but you couldn't get it here.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.980
So we decided, like, in a
week, we were going to open.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.744
And four and a half months
later, we were open--

00:05:15.744 --> 00:05:18.160
which, I don't really know how
we did it because today, it

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.680
literally can take four months
to get a meeting set up when

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.850
we're both not doing anything.

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.460
But anyway, that's
how we started.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.580
So that was March 15, 1982.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.430
It was me and Paul and two
employees and a space smaller

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.560
than this room.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.180
And today, we have--

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.880
I mean, minuscule by
Google standards--

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.270
700 employees, plus
we hire like 300 more

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.230
at the holidays for mail
order and for the bakehouse.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:49.390
And we're tiny by your
standards but large by ours.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.490
DOMINIQUE EHRL: So starting
off as a dishwasher

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.680
with a Russian history
degree from U Mich

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.890
and understanding how to be a
businessman in the restaurant

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.171
industry, what got you into
writing books and becoming

00:06:00.171 --> 00:06:00.670
an author?

00:06:03.354 --> 00:06:05.020
ARI WEINZWEIG: Well,
I started writing--

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.420
I don't know, it was probably
mid-'80s-- because I was

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.880
frustrated with the people who
were writing our newsletter

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:10.450
for us.

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.420
And I'm sure the fault
was mine, not theirs.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.790
But it just wasn't
saying things really

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.010
the way I wanted
them to get said.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.580
And I think one of
them gave notice.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.090
And so I decided I was just
going to do it by myself.

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:24.490
And that's how I
started writing.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.640
So I never intended to
be a writer, either.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.790
I just needed to write
in order to communicate

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:31.910
what we were trying to do.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.380
So that's really
how I got started.

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.807
And then I wrote
the newsletter for I

00:06:37.807 --> 00:06:38.890
don't know how many years.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.750
But I started to get really
positive feedback from people.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.270
And I sort of blew it off.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.242
And people kept
encouraging me to do more.

00:06:47.242 --> 00:06:49.450
And then people started
saying, you should do a book.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:50.110
It's so easy.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.400
You already wrote
everything, which,

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.600
of course, is not accurate.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.570
But when you don't actually
have to do the work,

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:58.930
everything seems easy
from the outside.

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.230
But anyway, I had gotten enough
encouragement that probably

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:06.370
by the mid-'90s, I decided that
if I were going to do that,

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.380
I needed to actually
learn more about writing.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.440
Because I didn't really
know anything about writing,

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.290
in particular, other than
what everybody in this room

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:15.100
knows about it.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:19.300
And so I started to read
books about writing.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.810
I got in a writing group,
which was super helpful.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:24.490
And I did that for 10 years.

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.670
And over the course
of that time,

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.190
then we self-published
a little book

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:32.240
on olive oil and a
little book on vinegar,

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.766
which got really good response.

00:07:33.766 --> 00:07:35.640
And then, that turned
into "Zingerman's Guide

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.450
to Good Eating," which came
out with Houghton, Mifflin.

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:41.472
And then it all kind
of went from there.

00:07:41.472 --> 00:07:43.680
Except I didn't really like
the big publishing world.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.945
And so after the
"Guide to Good Eating,"

00:07:45.945 --> 00:07:48.330
we pretty much pulled back
into doing all our own.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.140
So we do all the design.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.010
We print them here in Ann Arbor.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:56.350
I'm not a big Amazon fan, so
we try to stay off of there.

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:59.490
And that's sort of the
farm-to-table version of books.

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.560
So it started with food
writing, and then I

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.240
wrote a book about
customer service,

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.740
and then I wrote a
book about bacon.

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:10.030
And then the leadership
book started, actually,

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:15.000
as articles which then,
later, turned into books.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.582
So now there's a lot of books.

00:08:16.582 --> 00:08:18.290
DOMINIQUE EHRL: There
are a lot of books.

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:20.550
So speaking of
those books, you've

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:23.046
written a series of four--

00:08:23.046 --> 00:08:25.087
ARI WEINZWEIG: Yeah,
there's more to come still.

00:08:25.087 --> 00:08:25.410
DOMINIQUE EHRL: Awesome.

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:27.490
Well, we'll be on the
lookout for those.

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:30.090
So some of those, to
just give a name to them,

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:33.210
are "Building a Great Business,"
"Being a Better Leader,"

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:35.530
"Managing Ourselves,"
and lastly--

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:36.909
which is your most recent book--

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:38.770
"The Power of
Beliefs in Business,"

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:41.110
which is our focus
for today's talk.

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:44.460
So can you tell us where
did the idea or inspiration

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:48.060
to write a book about beliefs
in business come from?

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.402
ARI WEINZWEIG: I can.

00:08:49.402 --> 00:08:51.485
We don't have a little
white sheet, though, do we,

00:08:51.485 --> 00:08:52.274
to draw on?

00:08:52.274 --> 00:08:53.190
DOMINIQUE EHRL: We do.

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:54.410
ARI WEINZWEIG: We do.

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:56.530
Right over there.

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:59.774
So I'm going to show you
what the inspiration was.

00:08:59.774 --> 00:09:01.065
DOMINIQUE EHRL: Yes, please do.

00:09:01.065 --> 00:09:03.565
ARI WEINZWEIG: But it sounds
weird because I speak all over,

00:09:03.565 --> 00:09:06.970
and I teach a lot, and we
teach a lot internally.

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:10.440
But I had actually never thought
about the impact of beliefs

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.520
on, really, anything up until
I discovered-- thank you--

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.540
this cycle, which I'll show you.

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.102
And so when I talk
about beliefs,

00:09:18.102 --> 00:09:20.310
I'm not talking about
religion, sports, and politics,

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.680
which are the three areas
of beliefs that people

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.810
go on about incessantly,
although no one ever

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:25.800
changes their belief.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.550
They just talk about it.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:30.100
But this is about beliefs--

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.530
you got a little pen, too?

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:32.256
Perfect.

00:09:32.256 --> 00:09:34.640
SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.970
ARI WEINZWEIG: It'll work.

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:37.800
This is about beliefs,
like about what

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.360
we believe about
human beings, what

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.910
we believe about
computers, what we believe

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.880
about the price of a cup
of coffee or a brownie

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:45.940
or whatever.

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:52.600
So I learned this cycle from
Bob Wright, who's in Chicago.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.350
And he can't remember
where he learned it,

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:58.170
so I don't really know who
to give ultimate credit to.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:00.645
One of you's thinking, I'm
going to search this later.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.240
And you're going to
email me this afternoon

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.640
and tell me where it came from.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.870
But anyway-- I
look forward to it.

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:11.700
It's a self-fulfilling
belief cycle,

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.620
and it kind of blew my mind
when I learned it from him.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:16.277
And it turned into
a 600-page book

00:10:16.277 --> 00:10:18.360
because I kept studying
and studying and studying.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.984
And I just kept
realizing more and more

00:10:19.984 --> 00:10:21.420
the impact it was having.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.400
And I realized it was
going on all around me,

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.780
and all around us, every day
and that it had enormous impact

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:30.320
on our organization and
on my life and that,

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.160
basically, because
of what we believe,

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.970
we are mostly creating
what happens around us.

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:36.960
So ready?

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.250
We all have beliefs.

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:40.440
Based on what we believe,
we all take action.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.241
So literally, every
action that we take--

00:10:42.241 --> 00:10:43.740
including you all
coming here today,

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.530
me coming to talk to you,
Dominique initiating this

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:48.000
conversation--

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.350
every action we take is
based on what we believe.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.150
Based on our actions,
the people around us

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:57.810
start to form their own beliefs.

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:00.440
And based on their beliefs,
they, in turn, take action.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.460
And what blew my mind is
that, like 95% of the time,

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:06.290
their action reinforces
our original belief.

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:09.070
And this is going on all day
long, all over the world,

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:12.220
everywhere, OK?

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:13.430
Does this make sense?

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:16.340
So two really quick
examples, one organizational.

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:19.120
So if you were to have a
leader of an organization--

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.880
probably not yours or ours--
but where the leader--

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.590
CEO, founder,
whatever-- he or she

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:26.700
doesn't believe in training.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:30.120
What action would they take?

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.690
This is where you talk.

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:33.170
AUDIENCE: Deprioritize training.

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:34.378
ARI WEINZWEIG: They deprior--

00:11:34.378 --> 00:11:36.260
oh, there's a good word,
Mara-- deprioritize.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.095
So they deprioritize training.

00:11:38.095 --> 00:11:39.220
They don't do any training.

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.950
That we say they don't do any.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:42.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:43.750
We're not as advanced.

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:45.575
So when they don't
do any training,

00:11:45.575 --> 00:11:47.200
what do the people
who work there start

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.390
to believe about the
organization's belief in them,

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:52.425
about the possibilities
for the future, et cetera?

00:11:52.425 --> 00:11:53.550
AUDIENCE: There aren't any.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:54.883
ARI WEINZWEIG: There aren't any.

00:11:54.883 --> 00:11:57.320
When they believe there's
no positive future at hand,

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.940
what kind of work do they do?

00:11:58.940 --> 00:11:59.660
AUDIENCE: Bad.

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:00.659
ARI WEINZWEIG: Bad work.

00:12:00.659 --> 00:12:01.250
Very good.

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:05.120
They deprioritize
their work quality.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.540
And the CEO, or
the leader, goes,

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.539
thank god we didn't waste
any money on training.

00:12:08.539 --> 00:12:11.950
Look how bad these
employees are.

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:12.530
OK.

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:14.900
If you flip around the
belief of the leader,

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:18.590
then you get what we
do, which is-- whatever.

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:21.080
We have, like, 75
internal classes that we

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.040
teach in our organization.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.010
So not the same class
taught 75 times--

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:27.820
75 different internal
classes for a pretty small

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:28.610
organization.

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:31.625
What do the people who work
there start to believe?

00:12:31.625 --> 00:12:32.750
AUDIENCE: They can improve.

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:33.620
ARI WEINZWEIG: They can improve.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:34.120
What else?

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.049
AUDIENCE: They're valued.

00:12:36.049 --> 00:12:37.340
ARI WEINZWEIG: They're valued--

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.120
absolutely.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.100
What kind of work do they do?

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.300
Really good work.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:42.710
And we go, this training rocks.

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:43.900
Let's do a lot more.

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.600
The irony is it's exactly
the same employee base.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.960
All that changed is the
belief of the leader.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.260
The results are the opposite.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.700
The people are the same.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.470
This is all that changed.

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:02.860
On a super-simple,
seemingly stupid,

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.390
interpersonal
situation, has anybody

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:07.550
been in a work situation
where two people

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:09.235
weren't getting along?

00:13:09.235 --> 00:13:09.860
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:10.790
ARI WEINZWEIG: Six of you have?

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:11.290
OK.

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:14.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.700
So let's just say
that Billy believes

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.680
that Alice is kind of a jerk.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.870
How will he treat Alice
when he comes near her?

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:21.754
AUDIENCE: Poorly.

00:13:21.754 --> 00:13:22.670
ARI WEINZWEIG: Poorly.

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:24.487
What will Alice now
believe about Billy?

00:13:24.487 --> 00:13:25.820
AUDIENCE: [INTERPOSING VOICES] .

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:26.944
ARI WEINZWEIG: He's a jerk.

00:13:26.944 --> 00:13:29.630
And what will she do
when he comes near?

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:30.800
Treat him poorly.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.520
And he goes, it's
worse than I thought.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.530
If Billy changes his belief
and he says, you know,

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:39.529
I'll bet she's just
shy-- she feels awkward

00:13:39.529 --> 00:13:42.070
and uncomfortable, I remember
when I started how overwhelming

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:45.980
it was, it's hard to get all the
personalities down, et cetera,

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:47.720
she's probably a
totally good person,

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.760
but she just is anxious--

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.598
now what might he do
when he comes near her?

00:13:52.598 --> 00:13:53.486
AUDIENCE: Be nice.

00:13:53.486 --> 00:13:53.930
AUDIENCE: Say hi.

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:56.596
ARI WEINZWEIG: He might be nice,
welcome her, introduce himself.

00:13:56.596 --> 00:13:57.290
Here's my email.

00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:58.675
Here's my card, whatever.

00:13:58.675 --> 00:14:00.279
What's she start to
believe about him?

00:14:00.279 --> 00:14:01.320
AUDIENCE: Wow, he's nice.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.030
ARI WEINZWEIG: He's a nice guy.

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:02.988
You're getting it, man.

00:14:02.988 --> 00:14:03.800
Keep it going.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.940
Now what's she do?

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.866
When he comes near,
how's she treat him?

00:14:07.866 --> 00:14:08.490
AUDIENCE: Good.

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:09.364
ARI WEINZWEIG: Great.

00:14:09.364 --> 00:14:11.360
And he goes, see, I knew
she was a nice person.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.600
She was just anxious.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.580
This cycle is going
on all over the world.

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:18.650
Countries go to war over it.

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:21.350
And that's not a exaggeration.

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:23.490
So this whole
thing blew my mind.

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:26.790
And once I started to
realize this was happening,

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:30.740
then I realized my own beliefs
were getting in the way.

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:33.680
Because the reality
is, where do you all

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.950
think beliefs come from?

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:39.722
It's not Amazon.

00:14:39.722 --> 00:14:40.690
AUDIENCE: Your culture.

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:41.080
ARI WEINZWEIG: Yeah.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.520
So we're not born with them.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.530
Beliefs are not genetic.

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:47.110
It's all learned behavior.

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:48.730
We learn from people we trust.

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:50.860
So when we're little kids,
we don't know enough not

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:52.160
to fully trust our parents.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.420
So we just take
everything they give us--

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:56.770
it's true-- and we believe it.

00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:59.400
Then, as we grow up, we
start to get other inputs.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.630
So it could be a teacher.

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:02.050
It could be your minister.

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:06.607
It could be a TV star, an
athlete, an actor, your best

00:15:06.607 --> 00:15:08.440
friend on the playground,
your best friend's

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.880
parents-- whatever it is.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.510
But all of those beliefs
are being formed, right?

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:15.220
And so we start to
take on information.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:16.660
Sometimes it's through books.

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:18.850
That's how a lot of my
beliefs were formed.

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:21.910
So it could be from people
we never even met, right?

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:23.609
But the thing is that
we have the power

00:15:23.609 --> 00:15:24.525
to change our beliefs.

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:31.730
So what's happening
here is changeable.

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:34.360
It's not genetic, right?

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.194
Two last things and
then we'll move forward.

00:15:36.194 --> 00:15:37.276
DOMINIQUE EHRL: It's fine.

00:15:37.276 --> 00:15:37.820
Go ahead.

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:41.230
ARI WEINZWEIG: So I started
to break beliefs out

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:43.400
into three broad categories.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.280
Well, I started to
think about beliefs

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:49.070
as the root system of our lives
because you can't see them.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:53.910
But you're guaranteed what's
happening below the ground

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:55.710
is 100% correlated to above.

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:59.940
So negative beliefs, neutral
beliefs, and positive beliefs.

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:01.470
And if beliefs are
the root system,

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:03.030
it's not rocket science.

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:06.094
What kind of outcomes do you
get from negative beliefs?

00:16:06.094 --> 00:16:06.850
AUDIENCE: Weeds.

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:09.540
ARI WEINZWEIG: Negative
outcomes-- weeds, exactly.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:10.920
Neutral beliefs don't do much.

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.090
Positive beliefs create
positive outcomes.

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.130
So the reality is that
I started to realize

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:17.880
is it's totally impossible
to get positive outcomes

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.719
from negative beliefs.

00:16:19.719 --> 00:16:20.760
And that's true socially.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.780
It's true interpersonally.

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:22.821
It's true in your family.

00:16:22.821 --> 00:16:24.450
It's true of yourself.

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:26.070
And so then I
started to realize I

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:28.080
need to change the
negative beliefs I

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.640
have to positive
ones, which doesn't

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.722
mean there's no problems.

00:16:30.722 --> 00:16:32.430
It's just you could
have positive beliefs

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:34.650
about a problem
or negative ones.

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:36.120
And then the last thing is--

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.940
for the moment-- in here is
there's a little filter that we

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:41.460
all have, which is
that we filter out

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:44.190
all information that doesn't
support what we already

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:46.230
believe.

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:49.320
And we seek out or take in
information that supports

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.770
what we already believe.

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:52.680
And that's why, when
you read the news,

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.650
half the country arrives at
the totally opposite conclusion

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:57.040
of the other half
of the country,

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.600
even though they read
exactly the same story.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:01.770
Because they filter out.

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:04.290
They find evidence to
support what they already

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:06.369
believed in the first place.

00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:08.280
And this is going
on all day long.

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.560
So that's just the beginning.

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.397
But there you go.

00:17:11.397 --> 00:17:12.480
DOMINIQUE EHRL: Thank you.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:13.521
ARI WEINZWEIG: Thank you.

00:17:13.521 --> 00:17:14.460
Did that make sense?

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.284
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:17:16.284 --> 00:17:17.700
DOMINIQUE EHRL:
Wonderful, thanks.

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:21.119
So off of that, I
guess, encouragement

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:24.869
to change our beliefs,
to think more positively,

00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:28.890
to root ourselves in
positive beliefs, what advice

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:30.930
do you have for us
when maybe we start

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:33.780
to doubt those beliefs
that we've formed?

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.910
We start to maybe not
believe in the product,

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:37.900
the person, the organization?

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:41.042
How do we stop that and
prevent it when it happens?

00:17:41.042 --> 00:17:43.500
ARI WEINZWEIG: Well, I'm not
saying you shouldn't doubt it.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.874
I mean, it could be that
there's good reason to doubt it.

00:17:45.874 --> 00:17:49.800
It's just to explore the doubt.

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:54.090
Rollo May, the very
fascinating-- to me, at least--

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:56.880
mid-20th century psychologist,
said the opposite of courage

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:57.870
is not cowardice.

00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:59.520
It's conformity.

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:00.790
And I think that's true.

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:02.970
And so I think part
of what happens

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:05.190
is that beliefs become
commonly accepted

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:07.510
and then they go with the flow.

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:12.090
So this is true
all over the world.

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:13.800
Your beliefs can
change, but they

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.980
won't change until you come
in contact with information

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:19.650
that's incongruous with what
you already believed, right?

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:23.370
So that could be
true personally.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:28.131
You could have stereotyped
somebody very easily.

00:18:28.131 --> 00:18:30.870
Things like racism,
anti-Semitism, these

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:33.270
are all negative beliefs
that are socially

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:35.160
supported in many communities.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.490
And I don't believe
people set out to do ill.

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:40.564
But that's the belief
that's all around them,

00:18:40.564 --> 00:18:41.980
and that's what
they grow up with,

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:43.604
and that's what they
accept as the norm

00:18:43.604 --> 00:18:48.430
until they get themselves
into a different context.

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:51.000
So I have a lot of, through
Southern Foodways Alliance,

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.900
which is a really
great nonprofit--

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.040
like, I'm from Chicago.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:57.270
I mean, in hindsight, I
had very negative beliefs

00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:00.660
about the South because I grew
up in the civil rights era.

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:02.550
Coming from Chicago,
going to the South

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:04.860
was not something I would
really have imagined.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.750
But through Southern
Foodways Alliance,

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:09.510
it has really changed my
beliefs, in hindsight,

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:13.800
about the South and to
understand the real diversity

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:16.050
of what's going on and to
understand the culture more

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:16.900
in-depth, et cetera.

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.470
But anyway, I have a lot
of friends from there

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:25.500
who said that their parents
grew up in very racist settings.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.000
And I said, well, what happened?

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.541
And they're like, well, my mom
said when she went to college,

00:19:29.541 --> 00:19:31.581
it totally changed everything.

00:19:31.581 --> 00:19:32.080
Why?

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:34.780
Because if you grow up in a
town where that's the norm,

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.717
why would you question it?

00:19:36.717 --> 00:19:39.300
You hear it from everybody you
know, everybody you look up to.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.258
And then, when they got
in a different setting,

00:19:41.258 --> 00:19:46.260
they realized the falsity and
negativity of that belief.

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.870
But until some other
input comes in,

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:50.714
you don't know enough
to question it.

00:19:53.172 --> 00:19:54.130
DOMINIQUE EHRL: Thanks.

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:59.380
So is there a consequence
to positive beliefs?

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.000
Is there a way
you can overdo it?

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.987
And how do we balance that?

00:20:02.987 --> 00:20:04.945
ARI WEINZWEIG: My point
is not to be Pollyanna.

00:20:04.945 --> 00:20:06.790
So I'm not saying
there's no problems.

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.590
I just, like I said,
I think that you

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:11.110
could have a positive
belief about a problem

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:12.050
or a negative belief.

00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:16.540
So one of the stories
I use for that a lot

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:18.430
is the story of Food
Gatherers, which is

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:19.690
from before you all were here.

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:24.430
But in 1988, there
were a lot of people

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:26.260
going hungry in Ann Arbor.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:28.630
So a negative belief would
have been the system sucks,

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:31.450
society sucks, people are
selfish, this is hopeless,

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:33.700
there's nothing we
can do, it's horrible.

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:36.490
A positive belief is
the one that Paul had,

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:38.590
which was, this is
horrible, but we

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:40.270
can use what we
learned in business

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:43.250
to create a organization that'll
actually do something about it.

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:45.610
And that organization
became Food Gatherers, which

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:48.220
now, whatever, delivers like
five-plus million pounds

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.450
of food in Washtenaw County.

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:53.430
So the problems are the same.

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:56.490
It's just the negative belief
leads to more negativity.

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:59.820
It's as accurate, in
many ways, but it's not

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:02.580
leading to a positive outcome,
whereas a positive belief

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:07.720
about the same situation can
create something meaningful.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:08.520
So I don't know.

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.680
I mean, it's hard to know.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:14.730
There's no black and white
answer to what's real, right?

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:16.880
I mean, I didn't study
existentialist philosophy,

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:20.940
but we might not even be
here right now, right?

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:24.480
But what was once considered
completely impossible

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.770
is now considered normal.

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:30.000
Witness what you all
do every day, right?

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.040
So when you go back in history,
things that we take for granted

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:37.230
were not common.

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.990
American women who married
were no longer legally

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:47.550
allowed to be teachers up
until, like, the 1920s, right,

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:48.670
which sounds insane.

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:49.680
But that's what it was.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:55.720
Native Americans didn't get
to vote till, I think, 1927.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:58.170
So I mean there's just all
sorts of things in history

00:21:58.170 --> 00:21:59.670
that, when you
really go in there,

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:04.060
that people believed to be
normal and appropriate that now

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:07.990
would seem completely crazy.

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:10.180
DOMINIQUE EHRL: So switching
gears a little bit,

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:13.240
there's a large theme in
the book surrounding hope.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:16.220
Can you speak about how
we make hope happen?

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:18.180
ARI WEINZWEIG: I can.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:22.537
Well, hope is another
subject that I really

00:22:22.537 --> 00:22:23.370
never thought about.

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:24.830
I mean, obviously,
I know about it.

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:32.350
But it turns out that we
can actively create hope,

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:36.340
and we can often
unwittingly crush hope.

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.680
And it turns out,
from now having

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:41.710
studied it some, that,
not shockingly, people

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:45.850
with low hope
don't do good work.

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:51.400
You all and we all are in
a very high-hope setting.

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.700
With all of the
not-inappropriate conversation

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:57.370
around privilege and
everything in society,

00:22:57.370 --> 00:22:59.980
what I've sort of come to
realize is that the two things

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:03.280
you can't overcome--

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.620
you can overcome
all the other bias

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:09.640
if you have a little bit of
support and a lot of work--

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:14.170
but nobody can overcome
lack of positive beliefs.

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:16.480
And nobody can
overcome lack of hope.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:20.080
So when you have no hope,
you'll never do work.

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.220
Because there's no point.

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:25.450
And unfortunately,
a lot of workplaces,

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:29.982
leaders are unwittingly
smashing hope.

00:23:29.982 --> 00:23:31.690
Some of them might
know they're doing it.

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:32.890
But a lot of them mean well.

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:34.640
But they don't even
know they're doing it.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.070
So then I started
to look at, how

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:41.290
do you go to the positive,
which is how do you create hope?

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:42.850
Because most of us
in this room are

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:47.260
coming from high-hope settings,
and so we take it for granted.

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:49.270
And I started to look
at hope metaphorically,

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:53.860
like the sun, because when
there's no sun, nothing grows.

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:58.750
So the six things-- there's
a essay on this hope star

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:02.980
because sun, star was
too hard to pass up.

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:05.440
Going from memory,
so the first is

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:09.220
to help people see a more
positive future, right?

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.960
The second one,
though, is to see

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.580
paths to get to that future.

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:14.430
Because if you could
see a positive future

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:16.013
but you have no clue
how to get there,

00:24:16.013 --> 00:24:17.260
it's just magical thinking.

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:19.430
And it doesn't
actually help anybody.

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:22.360
And it turns out high-hope
people have multiple paths

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:23.200
to get there.

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.570
Low-hope people
will often have one,

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:27.250
and then something
goes wrong, and then

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:29.290
they see it as the end.

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:31.450
So in hindsight, the
story of me applying

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:34.480
at that restaurant three
times is an indication

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:37.180
that I grew up in a
high-hope setting.

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:39.220
Because somebody from
a low-hope background

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:41.632
would be equally
skilled as I was--

00:24:41.632 --> 00:24:43.090
which wasn't
particularly skilled--

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:45.310
but they would be
equally skilled as I was.

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:47.450
But when you're coming
from a low-hope setting,

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:51.160
you would give up, whereas
I just figured, whatever.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:52.390
I got to get a job.

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:53.260
Go back, right?

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:56.170
And so I'm guessing that's true
for a lot of people in here.

00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:58.570
Because we have this
advantage, socially,

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:01.480
of being raised in high-hope
settings because we're

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:02.950
surrounded by high-hope people.

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:04.690
So first is better future.

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:06.190
Second is how to get there.

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:09.570
Third thing would be to see how
they matter as human beings.

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:12.440
So this is not connected to
what they do for a living.

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:16.960
It's just that the person, he or
she themselves, are important,

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:17.710
right?

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:21.040
The fourth is how
their work matters.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.622
The fifth thing is
to help people see

00:25:22.622 --> 00:25:23.830
how the little things matter.

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:26.960
Because high-hope people
do the little things.

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.770
And that's actually what
gets you to success.

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:32.650
The low-hope people keep
waiting, in essence,

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:34.900
to win the lottery
of life somehow--

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:37.300
waiting for the right person,
waiting for the right job,

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:40.960
waiting for the right agent,
whatever-- whereas the people

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.210
with high hope tend to
do the little things

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:45.310
because they believe in
a more positive future.

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:47.440
And the sixth is to see
how we fit into something

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:48.580
greater than ourselves.

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:49.997
And that could be
an organization.

00:25:49.997 --> 00:25:51.996
It could be a department
within an organization.

00:25:51.996 --> 00:25:53.140
It could be your family.

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:54.550
It could be your church.

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:58.192
It could be any group
that you feel a part of.

00:25:58.192 --> 00:26:00.400
But everybody, I think,
wants to be part of something

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.670
greater than themselves.

00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:05.230
And if you think
about it, I realize

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:07.420
there's a natural
tension between you

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:12.590
matter as an individual
and you're part of a group.

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:16.060
So there's always
this creative tension.

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:17.950
So when you look,
like in history,

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:21.010
when you look back at
fascism or communism,

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:23.750
they were extreme examples
of where you fit in a group,

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:25.870
but you don't matter.

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:27.730
So the individual
in those contexts

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:29.050
is completely irrelevant.

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:30.250
It's only about the group.

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:32.740
So the key is to try to have
a creative tension where

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:36.940
the individual is important
and a group construct is also

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:39.660
important at the same time.

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:40.660
DOMINIQUE EHRL: Amazing.

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:41.170
Thank you.

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:45.550
So going off of beliefs and
having hope and nurturing

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:49.210
hope, having leaders
invest in creating hope,

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:51.070
why isn't everyone
already doing this?

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:53.290
When you go train for
ZingTrain and talk

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:56.132
to smaller businesses
about these concepts,

00:26:56.132 --> 00:26:57.340
what is the biggest pushback?

00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:00.084
Why is this so difficult?

00:27:00.084 --> 00:27:02.500
ARI WEINZWEIG: I don't know
that we get a ton of pushback.

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:04.990
I mean, the people
that come to us

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:08.060
have some inkling or belief
that there's some merit to it,

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:10.250
or else they wouldn't come.

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:13.190
Ironically, of course, the
people who need us the most

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:14.710
are the least likely to come.

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:19.910
Because they
believe, why would we

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:25.410
go to Zingerman's when we could
go to Harvard Business School

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:25.910
or whatever?

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:32.630
Gustave Landauer was a
very interesting anarchist,

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:35.900
a German Jewish pacifist
who was kicked to death

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:38.510
by the German Army in 1919.

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:40.830
And in one of the
pieces that he wrote,

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:42.260
he said, people
ask all the time,

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:44.330
why don't people already
do all this stuff?

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:46.705
And he said they don't do it
because their parents didn't

00:27:46.705 --> 00:27:48.823
do it.

00:27:48.823 --> 00:27:50.702
Managers learn
from other managers

00:27:50.702 --> 00:27:52.160
who learned from
other managers who

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.720
learned from other managers.

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.790
In the same way that
stuff becomes the norm,

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:58.190
they just have that
belief that that's OK--

00:27:58.190 --> 00:28:00.170
and then also out of ignorance.

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:00.740
I don't know.

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:03.323
There's not a lot of books out
there on hope in the workplace.

00:28:03.323 --> 00:28:08.610
So where would people
have heard of it, right?

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:12.660
And I guess, like in
my context of food,

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:16.430
if you never had a really
amazing oatmeal raisin cookie,

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:18.320
then the one they sell
you at the 7-Eleven

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.450
tastes totally fine.

00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:22.580
Because that's the
context that you have.

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:24.770
It's only when you
experience something

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:27.480
in the quality of workplace,
in the quality of relationship,

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.960
in the quality of
human interaction

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.930
that tells you there could
be more that you go for more.

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:36.980
When everybody around
you hates their job, when

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:39.410
every boss you had
treated you badly,

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:42.110
when everybody's image of
beliefs about work is it's

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:44.360
a total drag and you
shouldn't have to do it,

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:47.390
and you only have to do it if
you're too poor to not do it,

00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:50.750
then the odds of getting a great
experience are almost zero.

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:53.420
But once you start to
experience something else that's

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:56.870
more positive, then you
don't really go back.

00:28:56.870 --> 00:29:00.110
But I think, even with
all that, most people

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:03.350
in most organizations just
aren't thinking about it.

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:05.897
It doesn't come up.

00:29:05.897 --> 00:29:06.980
DOMINIQUE EHRL: Thank you.

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:07.820
ARI WEINZWEIG: Thank you.

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:09.028
Now you're thinking about it.

00:29:09.028 --> 00:29:10.750
DOMINIQUE EHRL: I am, actually.

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:12.660
Now, it makes a lot of sense.

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:13.160
All right.

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.650
So I want to switch
gears a little bit again.

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:19.790
So just for some context, all of
us here are very client-facing,

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:21.740
and we deal with
people all day long.

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:21.950
ARI WEINZWEIG: You are.

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:24.305
Because you're looking at
me, and I use your stuff.

00:29:24.305 --> 00:29:26.150
DOMINIQUE EHRL: You got it.

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:29.510
So Zingerman's, again, has
been coined as the biggest

00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:32.600
cool small company in America.

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:37.640
And can you tell us a little
bit about how customer service

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.880
weaves into this story,
and what businesses

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.740
can learn from a
service industry

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:45.560
like Zingerman's, and
how we can use that

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:48.110
in our day-to-day roles
here, even at Google?

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:49.070
ARI WEINZWEIG: Well, we
didn't bring it today,

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:50.944
but I wrote a little
book about service, too.

00:29:50.944 --> 00:29:54.504
But I think service is service.

00:29:54.504 --> 00:29:56.420
I don't think it matters
whether you're online

00:29:56.420 --> 00:30:05.600
or you're selling rice from
a street stand in Jamaica.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.080
I think it's all
service is service.

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:11.226
So I think a lot of--
really all of-- what

00:30:11.226 --> 00:30:13.100
we do, whether it's the
stuff around beliefs,

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:15.170
on hope, on customer
service, on visioning,

00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:17.461
on open book management, I
mean, they're basically just

00:30:17.461 --> 00:30:19.640
universal human principles.

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:23.540
And I think that adopting
service as a life approach

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:24.710
is actually the key.

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:31.410
Because when we live service
as strictly just to get money,

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:33.840
it's like marrying for money.

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.070
In theory, it could work.

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:36.330
But the odds of it being--

00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:37.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:39.390
Well, I mean, it's
not emotionally

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:41.460
sustainable over a
long period of time

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:43.230
because you don't
really believe in it.

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:45.570
And in theory, it got
you what you wanted.

00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:47.910
But you feel hollow
inside because you're not

00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:50.940
pursuing what you really
are aligned with ethically

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:52.750
and spiritually and soulfully.

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:54.630
And it's the same with service.

00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:57.190
So I think most of us--

00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:59.070
you know, Mara
could add in if she

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:01.500
wants-- but I think most of
us that work with the service

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.120
approach is it just
becomes how we live.

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:09.510
And I treat my girlfriend
in the same three

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:12.060
steps to great service that
I would use with you all.

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:14.610
And it's just because
it's a nicer way to live.

00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:17.729
And I think, in that
context, in hindsight--

00:31:17.729 --> 00:31:19.770
you're probably going to
get to it because you've

00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:21.220
done such a good
job of reading--

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:23.700
but the spirit of
generosity stuff,

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:26.400
it all feeds with
service, right?

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.770
So service is spirit
of generosity.

00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:31.920
And when we choose to live
every day and every interaction

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.900
as best we can, and perfectly
with the spirit of generosity,

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:36.990
then I think the
world goes better.

00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:39.540
And I think our lives go
better as the people doing it.

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:41.160
And that is what service is.

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:43.682
So in the book, there's
three steps to great service

00:31:43.682 --> 00:31:46.140
and five steps the handling a
complaint, which is basically

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:49.340
a recipe to actualize
what is a good intent

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:52.240
but most people don't
know how to make happen.

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:53.020
So yeah.

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:54.020
DOMINIQUE EHRL: Awesome.

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:56.700
So off of that, all of us
have had those interactions

00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:00.420
with customers where we
weren't even mean to them.

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:02.070
We were the nicest
we've ever been.

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:03.675
But we can't control
how they react.

00:32:03.675 --> 00:32:05.300
ARI WEINZWEIG: We
have those same ones.

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:06.175
DOMINIQUE EHRL: Yeah.

00:32:06.175 --> 00:32:08.760
And a lot of times,
there's yelling.

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:12.390
There's nowhere productive.

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:15.270
The direction of the
conversation's not productive.

00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:19.800
What is your advice, in being
in this business of service,

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:22.440
to get back on your feet?

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.360
After those
interactions, how do we

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:27.989
keep going and living
a service-driven life?

00:32:27.989 --> 00:32:29.280
ARI WEINZWEIG: Well, it's hard.

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:34.290
So in the first book,
there's an essay called

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:35.555
"12 Natural Laws of Business."

00:32:35.555 --> 00:32:36.930
And one of them
is that strengths

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:39.850
lead to weaknesses
and also vice versa.

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:47.670
So if you care a lot,
that's a strength.

00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:53.240
The weakness will be that it's
hard to not take it personally.

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:55.430
If you really don't care
about the customers,

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:57.020
and they act like
jerks, then it's

00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:58.714
just a self-fulfilling
negative belief.

00:32:58.714 --> 00:33:00.380
And you're like, I
knew they were jerks.

00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:00.880
Whatever.

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:01.680
Who cares?

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:04.280
So I don't know.

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:08.220
I mean, my dog died
three years ago.

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:09.300
And she was 17.

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:11.030
And it totally sucks, right?

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:15.020
If anybody's been through
that, it's the worst.

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:17.540
But the alternative is not
to care and not to have

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:18.890
had the good relationship.

00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:21.620
And it's the price of having
a good relationship is

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:25.460
that the pain is connected
with the positive.

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:29.240
So I guess it's just
finding ways to self-manage,

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.400
which is the third book.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:34.610
For me, it's the
things that I do--

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:36.020
try to be around good people.

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:40.830
So who can I talk to that's
going to help me reground?

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:43.350
I can't always do
it but running--

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:44.340
I run every day.

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:46.460
In fact, I'm leaving
here to go run.

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:50.060
It helps me to reground.

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:51.770
In the old days,
I used to just--

00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:53.750
I don't actually have
an office or a desk,

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:57.740
but I used to stash positive
thank you notes and stuff

00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:59.160
that people had given me.

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:01.700
I would leave them in my
mailbox so that then I just

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:03.620
had stuff laying around.

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:06.110
There's just little
things that can help.

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:08.840
Breathing helps a lot.

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.239
There's no right way.

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:11.780
I'm an introvert,
so I generally want

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:13.080
to get away from everybody.

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:15.204
Some of you all are
extroverts, so that's the worst

00:34:15.204 --> 00:34:16.520
thing you could imagine.

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:18.469
But the point is to know
yourself well enough

00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:19.790
to know how to reground.

00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:23.219
And it's easy for everybody to
say, don't take it personally.

00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:26.690
But if you care, you're going
to kind of take it personally.

00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:28.639
And then, this
taught me, actually,

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:31.070
to remember that they're
not jerks when they do that.

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:33.380
Most of those people are
just having a rough time.

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:35.179
And I try to remind
myself what's true,

00:34:35.179 --> 00:34:37.550
which is I only had to deal
with them for 20 minutes.

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:44.357
And I'm not being
flip, but they've

00:34:44.357 --> 00:34:46.190
got to live that way
the rest of their life,

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:48.170
or at least they've lived
that way their whole life.

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:49.711
And the people that
are close to them

00:34:49.711 --> 00:34:51.050
are dealing with that every day.

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:53.510
And that's way worse
than the little snippet

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:55.667
that I got stuck with.

00:34:55.667 --> 00:34:56.750
DOMINIQUE EHRL: Thank you.

00:34:56.750 --> 00:35:00.050
So lastly on customer
service, can you

00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:03.410
touch on, a little bit,
about what fairness

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:05.060
is in customer service?

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:06.080
I actually did read.

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:06.706
ARI WEINZWEIG: You did
do a good job of reading.

00:35:06.706 --> 00:35:09.140
DOMINIQUE EHRL: I did read
your customer service book.

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:11.060
So you talk about fairness.

00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:12.950
I think that was
a awesome concept.

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:19.540
ARI WEINZWEIG: Well, I
realized that we all grow up--

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:21.700
or most of us grow
up-- with this concept

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:24.170
that life's supposed to be fair.

00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:27.280
And we spend a lot of
time when we're little

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.690
telling our parents that
stuff's not fair and--

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:31.905
anybody done that?

00:35:31.905 --> 00:35:34.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:37.150
Anyway, but then I
realized, with service, it's

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:39.640
not fair because of exactly
what you just described.

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:41.620
And you or I could
give amazing service,

00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:43.330
and we could get
treated really badly,

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:45.940
having nothing to do with
us or the content of what

00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:46.675
we provided.

00:35:46.675 --> 00:35:48.100
It's just what's happening.

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:50.940
And it could be that that
person's significant other

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:53.140
is in the emergency room,
and they're flipping out.

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:56.230
It could be that their mother
just got diagnosed with--

00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:58.030
I mean, anything
could have happened,

00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:59.380
and we don't really know, right?

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:05.940
So we started to teach people
that fair is another planet,

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:10.420
and we're not on it, and that
if you need things to be fair,

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:12.610
service is the wrong
profession to be in.

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:14.440
Because I think in
the long-run, it's

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:16.540
going to work out for
everybody for the better.

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:18.670
But in the moment,
it's not really fair.

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:21.880
And it's just the way it works.

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:24.370
And we can't control
anything, let alone

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:25.420
what the customer does.

00:36:27.264 --> 00:36:28.180
DOMINIQUE EHRL: Great.

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:31.660
So in the books,
you have sprinkled

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:33.430
in a lot of exercises.

00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:35.740
So I was hoping
that maybe you would

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:38.320
be able to pick one
of your favorites,

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:40.482
and maybe we can all take
a minute to take a stab.

00:36:40.482 --> 00:36:41.440
ARI WEINZWEIG: Oh, wow.

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:42.430
Very good, Dominique.

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:43.696
OK.

00:36:43.696 --> 00:36:47.298
Do you all have
something to write with?

00:36:47.298 --> 00:36:48.256
DOMINIQUE EHRL: Phones.

00:36:48.256 --> 00:36:49.684
AUDIENCE: Typewriters.

00:36:49.684 --> 00:36:50.636
AUDIENCE: Oh, god.

00:36:50.636 --> 00:36:53.122
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:53.122 --> 00:36:54.330
DOMINIQUE EHRL: This is tech.

00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:55.050
Just kidding.

00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:57.183
ARI WEINZWEIG: Do you
all know each other?

00:36:57.183 --> 00:36:58.058
DOMINIQUE EHRL: Yeah.

00:36:58.058 --> 00:36:59.433
ARI WEINZWEIG:
What should we do?

00:36:59.433 --> 00:37:00.120
Three and Out?

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:03.020
I was going to have
them do This I Believe.

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:06.652
It's kind of hard to do
without writing, though.

00:37:06.652 --> 00:37:08.360
DOMINIQUE EHRL: Maybe
just talk about it,

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:11.282
something that we can hold
on to and practice later.

00:37:11.282 --> 00:37:12.490
Just thought it would be fun.

00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:15.160
ARI WEINZWEIG: OK, so This I
Believe is in the new book.

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:19.790
I named it after the 1953,
I think, CBS radio series

00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:22.844
with Edward R. Murrow, which
became an NPR series also,

00:37:22.844 --> 00:37:24.260
and came out in a
couple of books.

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:27.631
But it's basically a way to tap
your beliefs about anything,

00:37:27.631 --> 00:37:28.130
right?

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:31.760
So the exercise would
be just to sit down--

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.320
or, I guess, you
could stand up-- but

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:36.440
to sit down and, for
three minutes, list,

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.690
as fast as you can
write, everything

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:41.240
you believe about any
situation, person,

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:42.630
or whatever is in your mind.

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:45.440
So if you have a situation
you're struggling with at work,

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:48.890
at home, interpersonal,
project management,

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:51.654
whatever it might be,
do, like, three minutes.

00:37:51.654 --> 00:37:53.570
And the faster you write,
the better it works.

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:56.600
So don't think about it.

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.100
Write.

00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:01.760
And then it's just interesting
what will come out.

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:04.190
The reality is, because of
what I already told you,

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:06.770
what you write today will
be different than what

00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:11.870
you would have written
yesterday, which is OK.

00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:14.420
But just, the more
we learn, it's

00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:16.400
already changing
your beliefs based

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.260
on that little interaction.

00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:20.280
So that's one that
I would really--

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:22.220
I've started to
do it for anything

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:23.420
I'm having a challenge with.

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:26.210
Because I'm better at it now.

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:29.360
But you just realize,
I have negative beliefs

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:32.810
about whoever-- my cousin,
my neighbor, or whatever

00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:33.510
it might be.

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:36.967
And it doesn't mean you
have to change them.

00:38:36.967 --> 00:38:39.050
But it just means if you
want a different outcome,

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:42.320
it's unlikely to arrive without
a different set of beliefs.

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:46.850
Internal training
at Zingerman's.

00:38:46.850 --> 00:38:48.500
Not my own training of myself.

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:49.362
I have that, too.

00:38:49.362 --> 00:38:50.570
AUDIENCE: For your employees.

00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:52.792
What are some other ways
you inspire positive belief

00:38:52.792 --> 00:38:53.750
amongst your employees?

00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:55.490
Because they are
so super friendly

00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:59.570
and seem to stick around
for a really long time.

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:02.600
ARI WEINZWEIG: Well, I
think there's no one thing.

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:04.700
I think that's really
the point of the books

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:07.260
is that from studying
the anarchists

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:11.360
and restudying it actively over
the last five or seven or eight

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:16.790
years, the world at
large has been trained

00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:17.870
to think hierarchically.

00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:20.210
And I guess-- I don't know
if this is antithetical

00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:23.690
to the Google logarithm, but--

00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:25.732
so when you get trained
to think hierarchically--

00:39:25.732 --> 00:39:28.106
I'm not saying you're doing
this-- but the world at large

00:39:28.106 --> 00:39:29.700
is looking for this
singular answer.

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:32.390
They want to know your biggest
success, the key secret,

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:35.810
the biggest failure, what's
the number one thing?

00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:39.800
And I think that thinking
is the biggest problem.

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:42.931
Because I started to look-- as
per the idea of beliefs as root

00:39:42.931 --> 00:39:43.430
system--

00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:46.490
I started to look at
organizations as ecosystems.

00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:50.150
And in nature, there
is no hierarchy.

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:52.910
It's actually unnatural
to create hierarchy.

00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:56.360
And so I think in a
ecosystem in nature,

00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:01.010
in a healthy ecosystem,
everything matters.

00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:03.200
Seemingly small
things matter far more

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:06.290
than you might
imagine, like bees,

00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:08.720
which, by weight,
would be infinitesimal

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:11.900
but have an enormous
positive or negative impact.

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:16.500
And looking for one
singular thing doesn't work.

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:19.220
So I think getting people
in a healthy ecosystem--

00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:21.335
I'm sure you're
experiencing it here

00:40:21.335 --> 00:40:23.210
because you have friends
who don't work here,

00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:27.200
and they have a very
different work experience--

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.900
treating people with dignity
and respect from day one.

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:33.470
So again-- and maybe
it's my anarchist thing,

00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:35.600
maybe it's something
else-- but I'm not

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:38.630
any better than the newest
dishwasher that we hired.

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:39.920
They know a lot I don't know.

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:42.840
And they have a
lot of good ideas.

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.110
And I don't know
what they are yet.

00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:46.730
So I think that matters a lot.

00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:48.350
Teaching all this
stuff to everybody--

00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:50.600
so you don't have to
be senior management

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:51.710
to learn about this stuff.

00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:53.690
We just try to teach everybody.

00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:55.820
We're open book.

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:58.004
I think just by teaching
people about beliefs--

00:40:58.004 --> 00:40:59.420
it's not like
people go, I'm going

00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:00.795
to have a lot of
negative beliefs

00:41:00.795 --> 00:41:02.295
today and see how that goes.

00:41:02.295 --> 00:41:03.920
They don't even know
they have beliefs.

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:05.297
So they're not trying to do ill.

00:41:05.297 --> 00:41:06.380
They just don't even know.

00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:09.120
So I think all of
that's happening.

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:11.330
We give copies of
the business books,

00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:14.080
if people want to read,
for no charge, really.

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:15.560
And then, I think,
culturally, it

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:17.600
makes an enormous difference
who you're around.

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:20.240
So it'll come up
in the culture now

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:23.150
because people who have been
there will say something.

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:25.575
So all that and more.

00:41:25.575 --> 00:41:26.075
Hi.

00:41:26.075 --> 00:41:26.945
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:26.945 --> 00:41:28.730
So I was at the Roadhouse.

00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:30.650
And I was with family
from out of town.

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:33.560
And we love the experience.

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:36.539
My niece ordered a bagel, and
it took 30 minutes to come.

00:41:36.539 --> 00:41:38.330
And that was kind of
a terrible experience,

00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:42.020
and they kind of left feeling
negatively about the server.

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:43.790
I had a great experience
with the server

00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:45.924
because he brought
the check and said,

00:41:45.924 --> 00:41:47.090
can I get you anything else?

00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:49.400
And I jokingly said,
a shot of whiskey.

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:51.210
And mind you, it's noon.

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:54.353
He came back with the check
and a shot of whiskey.

00:41:54.353 --> 00:41:56.120
It was great.

00:41:56.120 --> 00:42:00.440
And so I'm just curious,
from a coaching standpoint,

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:02.480
if you're the
manager or the person

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:05.390
on staff and you witness
something, maybe,

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:09.560
here, like a discrepancy in
how a server handled something,

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:12.140
and you see something bad
versus something good, what

00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:15.230
do you do to then inspire
hope or remedy the situation

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:18.440
or coach when you
witness this happening?

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:19.940
ARI WEINZWEIG: Well,
with the bagel,

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:21.065
I don't know what happened.

00:42:21.065 --> 00:42:23.960
I mean, there's 1,000 things
that could have gone wrong.

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:28.400
And inevitably, they happen,
as frustrating and unfortunate

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:29.565
as it is.

00:42:29.565 --> 00:42:31.190
Is that what you're
asking, about that?

00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:33.020
Or you're asking about
that he gave you whiskey?

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:34.853
AUDIENCE: More from a
leadership standpoint,

00:42:34.853 --> 00:42:38.920
when you notice an
employee made a mistake--

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:41.284
in the, positive belief
about a negative situation.

00:42:41.284 --> 00:42:43.450
ARI WEINZWEIG: It probably
is to normalize mistakes.

00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:45.770
So I make 100 every day.

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:49.970
I think one of the
fallacious beliefs

00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:54.150
that American, and
probably most societies,

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:56.564
create is that leaders aren't
supposed to make mistakes,

00:42:56.564 --> 00:42:57.730
which, of course, is stupid.

00:42:57.730 --> 00:42:59.521
Because we're all making
them all the time.

00:42:59.521 --> 00:43:01.240
And with all due
respect to those of us

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:02.860
in formal leadership
roles, we don't really

00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:04.110
know what we're doing, either.

00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:09.400
So I think it's
never giving feedback

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:12.650
from some sort of
hierarchically superior place.

00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:15.130
It's just like, this is what
I noticed in the same way

00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:18.010
they're going to notice
stuff that I didn't do well.

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:20.230
And then, more to
focus on the positive.

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:22.510
And we have a ratio
that we recommend

00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:26.720
of four parts praise to one
part constructive criticism.

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:29.650
And that was supported by a
study, which some people later

00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:31.990
doubted the data but
intuitively makes sense to me,

00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:33.480
which is the Losada study--

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:37.990
L-O-S-A-D-A-- where they found
all successful organizations

00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:43.660
had a minimum of 2.9 parts
positive communication to one

00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:45.700
part of criticism.

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:47.770
That was the minimum.

00:43:47.770 --> 00:43:49.850
So I think focusing
on the positive.

00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:51.520
So if I knew who
gave you this shot,

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:53.740
I would give him
a big compliment.

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:55.780
Because it takes guts
to do that, and that's

00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:57.744
what we want people to do.

00:43:57.744 --> 00:43:58.520
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:58.520 --> 00:43:59.960
It'll stick with me forever.

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:00.793
ARI WEINZWEIG: Yeah.

00:44:00.793 --> 00:44:01.650
Absolutely.

00:44:01.650 --> 00:44:02.320
Yep.

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:03.150
Did you drink it?

00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:04.650
AUDIENCE: Oh, absolutely.

00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:07.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:09.040
AUDIENCE: Ari, the
Zingerman's company

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:10.520
has got so many great companies.

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:13.670
There's bakery,
restaurant, printing press,

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:15.130
et cetera-- training.

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:17.870
How do you take an idea, and
how do those get started?

00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:18.760
If you have an idea--

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:22.349
there's not a great home
delivery food company.

00:44:22.349 --> 00:44:23.390
What do you do with that?

00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:25.630
ARI WEINZWEIG: Well,
still, for a business,

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:29.190
the ideas really come from
the person who has the idea.

00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:30.790
So I have a million ideas.

00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:33.426
I think the ideas, actually,
are super easy and not

00:44:33.426 --> 00:44:34.300
hard to come up with.

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:37.370
The hard part's, who's
going to do it for 20 years?

00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:40.840
And so what we've found is
it's easier to find the idea

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:42.340
than it is to find the person.

00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:45.637
So Miss Kim is our
newest business,

00:44:45.637 --> 00:44:47.470
which is our Korean
restaurant in Kerrytown.

00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:52.510
So that's probably five or six
years of work by Ji Hye with us

00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:54.760
to get to where we opened.

00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:57.340
And that process
includes writing

00:44:57.340 --> 00:45:00.030
visions, which would be another
way to focus on the positive

00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:05.410
that I didn't mention before,
a lot of interactivity

00:45:05.410 --> 00:45:07.570
because when you're
working collaboratively,

00:45:07.570 --> 00:45:10.060
you need to be able to
incorporate other people's

00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:14.760
ideas, yet stand true to your
own, et cetera, et cetera.

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:16.540
And that's how they come.

00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:19.690
Internally, for smaller
things, the biggest thing is--

00:45:19.690 --> 00:45:21.940
there were a few of those
Bottom Line Change pamphlets

00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:22.440
over there.

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:24.880
So we have a change methodology.

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:26.709
And because a lot
of our approach

00:45:26.709 --> 00:45:28.750
is to teach everybody how
to lead from the minute

00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:31.120
they start working and
not wait until they

00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:34.940
get a title, which doesn't
really mean anything,

00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:38.440
that the idea is that when
somebody has an idea that they

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:39.400
can lead the change.

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:41.085
Now, they may not be
the decision-maker,

00:45:41.085 --> 00:45:43.210
but that doesn't stop them
from leading the change.

00:45:43.210 --> 00:45:46.600
And so my job becomes to coach
them in how to lead the change,

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:49.180
not to implement their
idea for them, which

00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:52.060
is, I would suggest, very
parental and paternalistic

00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:53.275
and not very helpful.

00:45:53.275 --> 00:45:55.150
It's better than not
implementing their idea,

00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:57.730
but I think the real thing
is to learn how to lead.

00:45:57.730 --> 00:45:59.112
And the pushback
is, well, people

00:45:59.112 --> 00:46:00.320
aren't going to listen to me.

00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:02.530
I'm like, dude, they don't
listen to me, either.

00:46:02.530 --> 00:46:05.590
That's what leadership is, is
how do you get people on board?

00:46:05.590 --> 00:46:07.870
Because there's
always resistance.

00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:09.880
So that's the two,
for a business

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:11.275
and for a smaller change.

00:46:17.002 --> 00:46:17.710
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:18.710
Thanks for coming today.

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:19.626
ARI WEINZWEIG: Thanks.

00:46:19.626 --> 00:46:20.950
Thanks to you for coming today.

00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:21.991
AUDIENCE: You're welcome.

00:46:21.991 --> 00:46:22.990
It was my pleasure.

00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:26.170
It's clear that the culture,
the beliefs, the people

00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:27.700
are core assets.

00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:30.610
But I would argue that one
of your biggest assets is

00:46:30.610 --> 00:46:34.010
the visual design brand
around Zingerman's-- the font,

00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:36.160
the posters, the illustrations.

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:37.390
How did that come about?

00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:39.010
And how do you
keep that thriving?

00:46:39.010 --> 00:46:39.660
I love it.

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:39.940
ARI WEINZWEIG: Yeah.

00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:40.439
Thank you.

00:46:40.439 --> 00:46:42.940
I agree with you.

00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:44.660
Well, strengths
lead to weaknesses,

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:46.260
and weaknesses can
lead to strength.

00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:49.860
So when we started,
we had no money.

00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:52.540
Today, everybody could
do food photography

00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:53.649
and you all could have--

00:46:53.649 --> 00:46:55.690
in this room, at least--
you could have a website

00:46:55.690 --> 00:46:57.877
up by 3 o'clock.

00:46:57.877 --> 00:46:59.710
But in those days, we
didn't have any money.

00:46:59.710 --> 00:47:02.982
So food photography,
it used to cost $10,000

00:47:02.982 --> 00:47:05.440
to have somebody come for a
day and shoot food photography.

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:07.780
So we just had our
friends and whoever

00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:09.820
was working there start
making stuff by hand

00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:11.410
because that was
what we could afford.

00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:12.993
And then we just
basically used what's

00:47:12.993 --> 00:47:17.380
now called "found materials,"
like cardboard boxes

00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:20.650
that the lettuce came in,
to make signs and stuff.

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:22.820
So that's really
where it came from.

00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:26.150
And then it evolved over time.

00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:27.799
That handwriting
is the handwriting

00:47:27.799 --> 00:47:30.340
of a guy named Steve Muno, who
worked for us for a long time.

00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:34.092
He's long since moved on
and is a very nice guy.

00:47:34.092 --> 00:47:35.300
But that was his handwriting.

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:36.580
It still is his handwriting.

00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:38.590
And Mara can do it, I think.

00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:40.060
But I am not able to.

00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:42.390
But many people
learned how to do it.

00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:44.680
Probably-- I don't know
when it was, 10 years ago--

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:48.370
the artist succumbed and allowed
it to be made into a font,

00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:51.340
although they are adamant,
and I agree with them,

00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:52.240
that you can tell--

00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:54.420
I can tell-- the difference
when it's been done by hand

00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:55.961
and when it's been
done off the font.

00:47:55.961 --> 00:47:58.070
But the font is helpful
for somebody like me,

00:47:58.070 --> 00:48:01.960
who can't reproduce it, and I'm
in a hurry doing some whatever.

00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:04.570
And then, as we grew,
then we stumbled into--

00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:08.590
we unwittingly fell into--
the problem of the look that

00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:12.100
had become the norm at the deli
started to get not reproduced

00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:15.310
in the other businesses, which
led to a lot of frustration

00:48:15.310 --> 00:48:19.420
and then realizing, from working
with Maggie at ZingTrain a lot

00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:21.010
over the years,
she's taught me when

00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:23.470
you have a big
frustration with somebody,

00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:27.160
it's almost always because you
have an unspoken expectation.

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:29.710
And then the challenge is to
look inwards and figure out

00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:31.575
what that unspoken
expectation is.

00:48:31.575 --> 00:48:32.950
And then it was
like, well, yeah,

00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:36.070
this is the way
Zingerman's needs to look

00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:39.190
and then being able to then
teach that more actively

00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:41.432
and train people
in how to do it.

00:48:41.432 --> 00:48:43.390
And then, within the
context of the hope stuff,

00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:46.540
is use one look for
the whole organization

00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:50.230
but then allow each business
to have its own manifestation

00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:52.270
of that within the
overall look so that you

00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:54.130
can honor the individuality
of the business

00:48:54.130 --> 00:48:58.427
but not lose the coherence
of the organization overall.

00:48:58.427 --> 00:48:59.260
AUDIENCE: Beautiful.

00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:00.930
As a design guy, I
loved hearing that.

00:49:00.930 --> 00:49:01.170
Thank you.

00:49:01.170 --> 00:49:01.450
ARI WEINZWEIG: OK.

00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:02.260
Cool.

00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:06.520
Well, the epilogue of the
new book is about my belief

00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:12.520
that business is like art and
that done well, it's good art,

00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:15.310
and done poorly, it's bad
art, and so that, really,

00:49:15.310 --> 00:49:18.520
all of the things that
go into design, I think,

00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:20.894
go into making a
healthy organization.

00:49:20.894 --> 00:49:22.685
DOMINIQUE EHRL: It'll
be our last question.

00:49:22.685 --> 00:49:23.337
Go ahead.

00:49:23.337 --> 00:49:23.920
AUDIENCE: Wow.

00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:24.669
A lot of pressure.

00:49:24.669 --> 00:49:28.190
ARI WEINZWEIG: Harris, man,
no pressure at all, dude.

00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:29.631
AUDIENCE: A lot of pressure.

00:49:29.631 --> 00:49:31.630
So when you were talking
about the belief thing,

00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:33.520
I was just curious,
from your point of view,

00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:35.410
I feel like it's very common for
all of us, as you were saying,

00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:36.640
to fall into the circle.

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:41.020
How do you go about identifying
when you fall into that rut,

00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:43.282
whether it's you or
someone close to you?

00:49:43.282 --> 00:49:44.740
And then a quick
follow-up to that,

00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:49.732
how do you mitigate that to
change the path of the circle?

00:49:49.732 --> 00:49:51.940
ARI WEINZWEIG: Well, there's
a recipe in the new book

00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:53.170
for how to change a belief.

00:49:53.170 --> 00:49:56.150
Because it's easier
said than done.

00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:58.720
If you've had a belief
since you were six,

00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:03.140
the roots are very deep, and
they don't change easily.

00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:05.960
And this is why you can see it
in society all over the world.

00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:08.110
I mean, people will
hold to their belief

00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:11.200
even though the evidence
clearly shows it's wrong.

00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:13.690
But they'll hold to their
beliefs anyways, right?

00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:17.920
So when-- was it
Copernicus or Galileo?--

00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:22.540
when he said that the sun didn't
revolve around the earth--

00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:25.180
which, now, we go, oh,
well, of course the earth

00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:26.200
revolves around the sun.

00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:28.750
But they used to believe the
sun revolved around the earth.

00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:31.670
So when he wrote that in his
book, the Catholic church said,

00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:32.830
well, you can't write that.

00:50:32.830 --> 00:50:33.492
It's wrong.

00:50:33.492 --> 00:50:35.200
In the Bible, it says
it's the other way.

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:36.991
And he said, yeah, but
this is what's true.

00:50:36.991 --> 00:50:38.350
They said, we don't care.

00:50:38.350 --> 00:50:41.510
You have to take it out.

00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:44.200
So when people have held
a belief for a long time,

00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:46.890
generally, they will work
really hard to maintain

00:50:46.890 --> 00:50:50.440
the belief in the face
of all sorts of evidence.

00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:54.970
I think, for me,
it just made me get

00:50:54.970 --> 00:50:57.875
myself to almost automatically
go, what do I believe?

00:50:57.875 --> 00:51:00.250
And then, I'm like, oh, yeah,
I believe they can't do it.

00:51:00.250 --> 00:51:04.690
Well, if I believe they
can't do it, they're doomed.

00:51:04.690 --> 00:51:07.790
Because if I'm their manager,
they're not going to succeed.

00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:11.200
So then I need to
re-examine my own belief.

00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:12.710
In terms of other people--

00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:15.660
here's the thing-- is you can't
make anybody change a belief.

00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:20.470
It's a internal process.

00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:23.260
And part of what tends
to happen socially

00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:25.884
is people argue with others
that they should change

00:51:25.884 --> 00:51:27.550
their belief, which
I would suggest just

00:51:27.550 --> 00:51:29.770
makes the roots go deeper.

00:51:29.770 --> 00:51:32.270
Even if they're wrong, it just
makes the roots go deeper.

00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:33.620
And this is why people--

00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:36.550
I mean, this is the national
political scene right now.

00:51:36.550 --> 00:51:38.260
No one's going to
change their mind.

00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:40.301
The roots are just going
to go deeper and deeper.

00:51:40.301 --> 00:51:41.350
And I know where I stand.

00:51:41.350 --> 00:51:43.570
But it's not going to convince
anybody else to change

00:51:43.570 --> 00:51:45.280
their mind that
doesn't agree with me.

00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:48.190
So I think, in the end
of the day, all we can do

00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:51.010
is model and share information
and hope for the best.

00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:54.720
Because you can't force anybody.

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:57.370
I have the most
impact on my own self.

00:51:57.370 --> 00:51:59.510
And that's really where
I can make a difference.

00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:01.750
And if I change my
beliefs for the better,

00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:03.340
then it might change
two other people,

00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:04.910
and it might change
two other people.

00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:06.700
But I don't think there's any--

00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:08.920
there's no global,
universal solutions.

00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:10.790
There's just people.

00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:13.110
DOMINIQUE EHRL: Can we give
Ari a round of applause?

00:52:13.110 --> 00:52:14.010
Thank you.

00:52:14.010 --> 00:52:15.210
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:52:15.210 --> 00:52:17.060
ARI WEINZWEIG: Thank you.
