00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.750
Chuck: If the moon is constantly getting
farther away from the earth every year

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.340
Neil: About two inches a year. Chuck: Okay, so about
two inches a year, then why do we have a

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.440
supermoon where the moon appears larger?

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.720
Neil: Okay, first I got to nip this in the bud.
Don't get me started!

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.480
Chuck: I'm getting you started. Neil: Don't get me started.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.200
Chuck: I got to get you start here!
Neil: All right, so

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.940
there's something called a supermoon.
I don't know who first called it a supermoon.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.360
I don't know, but if
you have a 16-inch pizza would you call

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.080
that a super pizza compared with a 15-inch pizza?

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.540
Chuck: How many meat toppings are we talking? Because if I'm talking like

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.300
totally loaded, then yes, I'm going.
Neil: And is there cheese in the crust?

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.840
Chuck: Right, if there's cheese in
the crust, I mean, come on!

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.420
Neil: The supermoon is a 16 inch pizza compared
with a 15 inch pizza. It's a slightly

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.620
bigger moon. I ain't using the adjective super. Excuse me. Chuck: That's like Super Tuscan.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.860
Neil: I'm not going there. Super Tuscan
wine, yes. They're super because

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:04.540
they're super priced. It costs like four
or five times regular. You've been paying like $100!

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.740
Alright, so where was I? Why are we talking about wine?

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.040
I'm talking about the universe here!
Chuck: I now, what can I say, I'm

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.500
always thinking about wine. So there
is no supermoon is what you're saying.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.460
Neil: So the supermoon is... the moon's orbit
around the earth it's not a perfect circle. Sometimes

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.360
it's closer, sometimes it's farther away.
And every month there's a moment

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.950
when it's closest. Occasionally, that
moment when it's closest coincides with

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.580
a full moon. People are calling that a
super moon,  but there's super half-moons.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.790
Alright! Every month! So
one of those phases is the closest.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.460
I don't hear people going super-crescent, super half-moon. No! No!

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.340
I told you don't get me started!
Not only that, I was going to Tweet this

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.420
but I'm going to say it here and now
first. You ready? Do you know the full

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.940
Moon has no higher tidal effect on Earth
than any other phase of the Moon?

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:06.860
Chuck: Now you're just making stuff up! 
Neil: Alright, when we come back, more StarTalk.
