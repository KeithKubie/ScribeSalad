00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.990
The human eye is an amazing structure, even if

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.370
it really has an imperfect sort of looking design. Normally,

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.390
light comes in here through the, the pupil, must pass

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.370
through this initial clear region, and then has to make

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.480
it to the back of the eye, called the

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.210
retina. And way here back in the back of the

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.430
retina past layers of cells, if the light can make

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.560
it through all of these occluding structures, all of these.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.150
Things blocking it's path and it makes it to the very back to this oddly shape

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.520
cells here called cone cells. That are actually

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.070
interpreted as the color that we see everyday. Now

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.030
the visible lights spectrum is interpreted by humans

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.740
to the detection of three main wavelengths of

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.310
light that corresponds to three main colors. Red,

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.960
green and blue. There's a special type of cell

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.310
here in the back of the retina, that's able

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.490
to detect these three different colors. And it's called

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.720
the cone cell. And there are three different kinds

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.200
of cone cells that can recognize each of the

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.640
different colors. Now these three different types of cone

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.320
cells. Can each detect a certain wavelength of light?

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.510
Remember, light is actually energy and it travels in

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.310
the form of the wave and the color spectrum

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.840
essentially correlates to certain wavelengths that our eyes

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.690
can see. The longer wavelengths are in the red

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.840
spectrum and the shorter wavelengths are in the

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.520
blue spectrum. And the middle wavelengths that we can

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.830
see are in the green spectrum. Each of

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.460
these different types of cone cells are actually able

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.650
to detect a specific wavelength of light. Together,

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.590
these give you all the colors, all the combinations

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.760
of all the colors that you can see.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.280
You know this whole amazing process is possible

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.150
because there are proteins, like OPN1LW, that absorb

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.230
light at each of those different wavelengths. In the

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.650
case of OPN1W, it focuses on absorbing light

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.765
from the red wavelengths. So if this is the

00:02:00.765 --> 00:02:04.310
cone-cell membrane, right? We're really zoomed in here,

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.610
and in the membrane of the cell there are

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.370
this proteins. Specifically PN1W, that absorbs red light,

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.090
and essentially tells the cell, and then ultimately

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.560
the brain, that hey, this is red light.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.550
Now in the case the premature stop codon that

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.070
we talked about in the last exercise. The

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.660
changing from cytosine to thymine causes a severely shortened

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.900
protein that doesn't actually make it to the

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.080
membrane. So now the cone cell can't detect red

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.260
wavelength of light and it just bounces away. So what

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.230
I want you to do is think about this mutation

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.540
and categorize it. Whether you think it's a loss of

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.400
function, a gain of function, or no change in function mutation.
