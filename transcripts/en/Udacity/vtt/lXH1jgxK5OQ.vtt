00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.130
Okay, so a type A blood could be the

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.670
allelic combination of either two A's or an A and

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:13.170
an O allele. Type B could be either two B alleles or a B and an O allele. For AB

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.820
there's only one option. To have both A antigen

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.390
and B antigen, one of your alleles must be A

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.870
and one of your alleles must be B. There's no

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.950
other combination of alleles that gives you AB blood type.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.450
And the same thing is true for type O. The only

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.100
way you can be type O is if you have two

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.880
O alleles. If you either an A or a B allele

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.750
then you're going to end up with an A or B blood type.
