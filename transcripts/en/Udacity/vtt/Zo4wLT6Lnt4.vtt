There is a very useful class inside
of AV foundation that focuses

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.462
on recording audio
called AVAudioRecorder.

00:00:07.462 --> 00:00:13.230
We're going to utilize this class for,
you guessed it recording the audio.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.510
One important skill in iOS development
is being able to read code that you have

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.272
never seen before.

00:00:18.272 --> 00:00:19.560
I'm going to show you a bit of code,

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.562
and ask you to get a gist
of what it's doing.

00:00:21.562 --> 00:00:24.220
We're going to be taking
a closer look at this code, and

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.690
see if you can tell what's going on.
