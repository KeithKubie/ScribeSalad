00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now, I'm being a little cryptic here.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
What do I mean by "ratios?"

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let's go back to our similar triangles to figure out what I mean.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Now, I have two triangles here.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
They're similar because the angles match,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
but the sides are different.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'm going to label these sides a, b, c and these sides A, B, and C.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
You can see that even though these sides are all longer,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
there's some correspondence between A and side a.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Likewise with C and c and B and b.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
But what exactly is that correspondence?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
What do these things all have in common?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The fact is they have a ratio in common.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
What I mean by that is they're linked through ratios.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
If I look at the ratio side A to side B,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I'm going to find that's exactly the same as the ratio of side a to side b.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
In fact, it doesn't matter how big or small I make this triangle,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
this equality will always hold true.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And that's a really powerful mathematical tool that we can use.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
For example, let's say I didn't give you variable names here,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
but I gave you some actual numbers.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So, 3 m, 4 m and 5 m are replacing our sides from before,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and these are still unknown.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
But let's say I told you that--I don't know--side B was equal to 6 m.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I can use this to calculate side C,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.000
because I know that C/B has to equal, well, the corresponding sides--4/3.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
More precisely 4 m over 3 m.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Notice that when we do this, the units cancel out,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
so it doesn't even matter that we were using meters.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
We could have been using inches or stadia or furlongs or any unit we'd like.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Now, I know this ratio--C/B--is equal to 4/3.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
But notice that I have one other piece of information.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
B is actually equal to 6 m, so let's write that in.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Now if I want to solve for C, I multiply both sides by 6 m,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and that gives me the following: C = 4/3  6 m, also known as 8 m.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Okay, that wasn't so bad.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
We used the power of ratios to calculate an unknown side of a triangle,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and this is a huge tool to have at our disposal.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Can you do the same to solve for side A?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
How long is side A in meters.

00:02:28.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And you can just enter the number. You don't have to type in the m.
