00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Here comes the answer. Well, that actually was a rather boring quiz.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Of course data invariants, if it's large data structures, cover much of the space.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
If these are data structures that are frequently used,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
they're frequently checked with every single use.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Data invariants make up an important part of all sorts of pre- and postconditions.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Finally, the assertions you write down here provide helpful documentation for programmers.
