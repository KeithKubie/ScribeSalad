00:00:00.048 --> 00:00:01.808
- [Voiceover] What I wanna
do in this video is see

00:00:01.808 --> 00:00:05.668
if we can find the measure of angle D,

00:00:05.668 --> 00:00:07.336
if we could find the measure of angle D

00:00:07.336 --> 00:00:09.196
and like always, pause this video,

00:00:09.196 --> 00:00:11.216
and see if you can figure it out.

00:00:11.216 --> 00:00:12.996
And I'll give you a little bit of a hint.

00:00:12.996 --> 00:00:17.966
It'll involve thinking about
how an inscribed angle relates

00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:20.690
to the corresponding to
the measure of the arc

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.630
that it intercepts.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.970
So, think about it like that.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.490
All right, so, let's work
on this a little bit.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.010
So, what do we know, what do we know?

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.430
Well, angle D, angle D intercepts an arc.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.170
It intercepts this fairly
large arc that I'm going

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.430
to highlight right now
in this purple color.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.690
So, it intercepts that arc.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.450
We don't know the measure of that arc

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.810
or at least we don't know
the measure of that arc yet.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.990
If we did know the measure of this arc

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.368
that I'm highlighting, then
we know that the measure

00:00:53.368 --> 00:00:56.178
of angle D would just be
half that because the measure

00:00:56.178 --> 00:01:00.518
of an inscribed angle is half the measure

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:02.378
of the arc that it intercepts.

00:01:02.378 --> 00:01:03.918
We've seen that multiple times.

00:01:03.918 --> 00:01:05.618
So, if we knew the measure of this arc,

00:01:05.618 --> 00:01:07.018
we would be able to figure out

00:01:07.018 --> 00:01:09.298
what the measure of angle D is.

00:01:09.298 --> 00:01:12.738
But we do know, we don't
know the measure of that arc,

00:01:12.738 --> 00:01:15.418
but we do know the measure of another arc.

00:01:15.418 --> 00:01:19.658
We do know the measure of the
arc that completes the circle.

00:01:19.658 --> 00:01:22.358
So, we do know the measure of this arc.

00:01:22.358 --> 00:01:24.102
You might be saying,
hey wait, how do we know

00:01:24.102 --> 00:01:25.872
that measure, it's not labeled.

00:01:25.872 --> 00:01:28.252
Well, the reason why we
know the measure of this arc

00:01:28.252 --> 00:01:31.192
that I've just highlighted
in this teal color is

00:01:31.192 --> 00:01:34.012
because the inscribed
angle that intercepts it,

00:01:34.012 --> 00:01:35.390
they gave us the information,

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.190
they said this is a 45 degree angle.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.330
So, this is a 45 degree angle.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.810
Then this over here is a
90 degree, 90 degree arc.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.530
The measure of this arc is 90 degrees.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.560
The measure of arc, I guess you could say

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.768
this is the measure of arc,
I'ma write it this way.

00:01:53.768 --> 00:01:58.598
The measure of arc, WL.

00:01:58.598 --> 00:02:03.270
WL is equal to 90 degrees,

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.390
it's twice that, the inscribed
angle that intercepts it.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.130
Now, why is that helpful?

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.890
Well, if you go all the
way around the circle,

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.710
you're 360 degrees.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.220
So, this purple arc that we
cared about, that we said hey,

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.730
if we could figure out
the measure of that,

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.890
we're gonna be able to figure
out the measure of angle D.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.378
That plus arc, WL,

00:02:23.378 --> 00:02:27.008
they are going to add up to 360 degrees.

00:02:27.008 --> 00:02:28.108
Let me write that down.

00:02:28.108 --> 00:02:32.548
So, the measure of arc, let's see,

00:02:32.548 --> 00:02:36.684
and this is going to be a
major arc right over here.

00:02:36.684 --> 00:02:39.242
This is so LIW,

00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:43.280
the measure of arc LIW

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.090
plus the measure of arc WL

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.426
plus the measure

00:02:50.426 --> 00:02:54.744
of arc WL plus this right over here.

00:02:54.744 --> 00:02:58.104
That's going to be equal to 360 degrees.

00:02:58.104 --> 00:03:02.464
This is going to be equal to 360 degrees.

00:03:02.464 --> 00:03:05.444
Now, we already know
that this is 90 degrees.

00:03:05.444 --> 00:03:08.064
We already know WL is 90 degrees.

00:03:08.064 --> 00:03:10.604
So, if you subtract 90
degrees from both sides,

00:03:10.604 --> 00:03:15.284
you get that the measure of
this large arc right over here,

00:03:15.284 --> 00:03:18.530
measure of arc LIW is going

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.450
to be equal to 270 degrees.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.846
I just took 300, I went all
the way around the circle,

00:03:23.846 --> 00:03:25.426
I subtracted out this 90 degrees

00:03:25.426 --> 00:03:28.046
and I'm left with 270 degrees.

00:03:28.046 --> 00:03:29.086
So, let me write that down.

00:03:29.086 --> 00:03:32.106
This is the measure of this
arc in purple is 270 degrees.

00:03:32.106 --> 00:03:34.802
And now, we can figure out
the measure of angle D.

00:03:34.802 --> 00:03:37.700
It's an inscribed angle
that intercepts that arc

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.028
so it's going to have half the measure,

00:03:40.028 --> 00:03:42.168
the angle's going to
have half the measure.

00:03:42.168 --> 00:03:45.156
So, half of 270

00:03:45.156 --> 00:03:49.106
is 135 degrees and we're done,

00:03:49.106 --> 00:03:51.986
and you might notice
something interesting,

00:03:51.986 --> 00:03:56.926
that if you add 135
degrees plus 45 degrees,

00:03:56.926 --> 00:04:00.646
that they add up to 180 degrees.

00:04:00.646 --> 00:04:03.866
So, it looks like at least for
this case that these angles,

00:04:03.866 --> 00:04:07.606
these opposite angles of
this inscribed quadrilateral,

00:04:07.606 --> 00:04:12.426
it looks like they are supplementary.

00:04:12.426 --> 00:04:13.864
So, an interesting question is

00:04:13.864 --> 00:04:15.704
are they always going to be supplementary?

00:04:15.704 --> 00:04:19.064
If you have a quadrilateral,
an arbitrary quadrilateral

00:04:19.064 --> 00:04:21.344
inscribed in a circle,
so each of the vertices

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:24.944
of the quadrilateral sit on the circle.

00:04:24.944 --> 00:04:28.544
If you have that, are opposite
angles of that quadrilateral,

00:04:28.544 --> 00:04:30.464
are they always supplementary?

00:04:30.464 --> 00:04:32.784
Do they always add up to 180 degrees?

00:04:32.784 --> 00:04:35.550
So, I encourage you to think
about that and even prove it

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.150
if you get a chance, and
the proof is very close

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.550
to what we just did here.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.110
In order to prove it, you
would just have to do it

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.776
with more general numbers like, you know,

00:04:42.776 --> 00:04:45.494
instead of saying 45 degrees,
you could call this X,

00:04:45.494 --> 00:04:47.970
and then you would want to
prove that this right over here

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.330
would have to be 180 minus X.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.900
So, I encourage you to do that on your own

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.198
but I'm gonna do it in a video as well

00:04:53.198 --> 00:04:56.008
so you can check if our
reasoning is similar.
