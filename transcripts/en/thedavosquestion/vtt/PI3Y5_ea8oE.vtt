00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.550
&gt;&gt; Can India become a superpower?
Yes, the answer is definitely yes.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.910
Given the natural resources, the kind of the
domestic settings and what

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.890
we have, and the demography and the skills
sets that are available,

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.140
definitely India can become a superpower.
But the biggest question there is when?

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.090
When is the biggest question.
With the [INAUDIBLE] regulators, definitely

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.789
we need a capital markup,
competition to step into the market so that

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.859
you pool the domestic
savings.

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.550
And I would put that timeframe of ten years,
that is by 2020, we must

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.140
see India becoming a superpower given all
the advantages that we have

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.790
in terms of manufacturing, in terms of resources,
in terms of skill

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.260
sets, and in terms of developments [INAUDIBLE].
