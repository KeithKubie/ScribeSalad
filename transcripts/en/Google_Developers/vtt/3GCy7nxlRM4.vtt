CHRIS BROADFOOT: Hi, everyone.

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:02.420
I'm Chris Broadfoot.

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.520
Welcome to another Google
Maps Developer Relations

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.730
screencast.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.910
In this tutorial, I'll be
showing you how to get started

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.780
with the Google Maps API.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.980
All you'll need is your favorite
text editor and the

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.420
web browser of your choice.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.770
If you're feeling confident,
please follow along.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.100
If not, just watch all the way
through to get an overview.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.715
Let's start with Hello World,
or you could call it "Hello

00:00:21.715 --> 00:00:24.700
Map." Fire up your text
editor and start with

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.540
a blank HTML page.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.770
We first need somewhere
to put our map.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.930
We'll use an HTML div element.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.170
Next, we'll need to include
the Maps API bootstrap.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.670
The web browser will download
the necessary code to display

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.470
maps on your page.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.850
You'll notice the sensor
parameter.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.940
You need to set this to True if
your map is doing something

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.560
with the GPS, like using
HTML5 geolocation.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.690
If not, you can safely
set it to False.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.290
We need some code to run when
the page has loaded.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.250
The easiest way to do this is
to add an onLoad handler to

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.590
the body tag.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.170
The code will run when the
page is fully loaded.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.620
Inside the initialization
function, we create a new map.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.230
Everything in the Google Maps
API is namespaced under

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.970
google.maps.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.380
The map constructor takes
two parameters.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.370
The first is the map container,
in our case an HTML

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.650
div element, and the second
is a set of map options.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.260
Let's first ignore the map
options and just create a map.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.170
Since the div is empty,
it has no height.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.540
The map won't be visible.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.130
We can use some CSS to
give it some height.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.730
Let's refresh the page, and we
can see the div sits nicely on

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.480
the page, but there's no map.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.610
It's just gray.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.990
It turns out some options
aren't really optional.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.410
There are three required options
to display a map--

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.830
Center, Zoom, and MapTypeId.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.780
The center is a Lat-Long
object.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.720
There are coordinates in the
world where you want your map

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.990
to be centered.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.970
Zoom specifies how zoomed
in the map should be.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.850
Zoom level 0 means the map is
zoomed all the way out, and

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.890
you can see the whole world.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.550
Changing MapTypeId will
change the base map.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.400
Here we're using Roadmap,
but you could use

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.380
Satellite, for instance.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.100
If we refresh the page,
voila, we see our map.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.940
What's next?

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.310
Head over to the Google
Developers web site.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.290
Check out the tutorials
and documentation.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.860
Before you make your map live,
be sure to get a Maps API key.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:24.590
Thanks for listening.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.960
Now get out there and
start building the

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.210
next awesome map app.
