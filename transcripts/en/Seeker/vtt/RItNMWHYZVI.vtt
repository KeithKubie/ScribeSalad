This episode of DNews is brought to you by
JackThreads.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.350
Do you wanna know what color gets ME in the
mood?

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.829
hey guys, Julia here for DNews

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:15.249
The colors man, the colors!

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:19.730
If you’re not completely color blind, kid,
you might associate certain colors with certain

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:20.730
feelings.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.880
But the idea that colors affect moods seems
like.. well like baloney to me.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.960
But studies as far back as the 1930s show
that people, at least in the Western world

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.249
associate colors with specific feelings.

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:33.620
We use colors as metaphors for emotions.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.190
Red represents anger, while blue is seen as
serene and dignified.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.449
A study published more recently in BMC Medical
Research Methodology found this to hold true.

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:45.800
Some healthy people picked a happy yellow
as associated with their mood, while some

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.190
people with depression and some people with
anxiety picked shades of grey to describe

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.199
their mood.

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:52.350
Colors can even change the way drugs work.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.350
Seriously.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.100
The color blue makes for better sedatives
while red makes stimulants more effective.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.539
Speaking of red… there really seems to be
some strong feels surrounding the hot hue.

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:05.330
Red seems to be a universal color that means
stop, danger or hot.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.270
While you might think this has to do with
culture it might have to do with our biology.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.170
One study in the journal Emotion found that
when people see red they react stronger and

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.170
faster.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.140
Red is often seen as the sexy color, and one
study published in the Journal of Experimental

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.630
Social Psychology found that to hold up across
different cultures.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.290
But it’s not just people, one study published
in Psychological Science found that male rhesus

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.310
macaques avoid or act submissively around
someone who wears red.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.450
Another study published in the journal Evolution
and Human Behavior found that female macaques

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.240
tend to gaze longer at images of male hindquarters
surrounded by frames of red than the same

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.490
image framed with blue.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.340
So maybe the roots of red reactions lie deep
within our DNA.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.689
Some scientists think this could because red
is so important for communication.

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.390
A flushed face could signal that someone is
angry or ready to hit the sheets.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.439
But other colors carry meaning too.

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.880
Kermit would be happy to know that it’s
pretty easy, well calming being around green.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.649
One study published in environmental science
and technology found that the color green

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.880
might make you enjoy your workout more.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.440
The researchers found that men who looked
at the color green while working out were

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.030
less tired and had less mood disturbances.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.740
Other studies show that colors with shorter
wavelengths like blue and green evoke feelings

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.740
of calmness.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.810
A study published in Applied Psychology: Health
and Well-Being found that kids with ADHD experience

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.150
fewer symptoms after playing in an outdoor
green space.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.431
Green might also help enhance your creativity,
according to a study published in the journal

00:02:27.431 --> 00:02:30.090
Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.750
These benefits of green might be because a
lush green landscape meant a fertile land

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.110
with plenty of food for our ancestors.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.050
Blue can mean a few different things.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.290
One shade might be calming while a darker
hue might signal sadness.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.390
But blue light might perk us up.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.630
One reason might be because blue acts on our
biological clock.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.600
On a bright sunny day, the sky is a brilliant
blue, telling us to be awake.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.120
This is one of the reasons why the blue light
from your laptop and phone screens can keep

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.120
you awake at night.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.790
So if you want to get pumped up, you should
be seeing red.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.030
Want to calm down?

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.340
Surround yourself with hues of blue and green.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.450
And if you want to put yourself and others
in a good mood, try changing the color of

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.450
your shirt!

Speaking of color, have you ever wondered
if we all see the same color?

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.990
Like is your red the same as my red? or is
your red like my blue?

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:53.990
