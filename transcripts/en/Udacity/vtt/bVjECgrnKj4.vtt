00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So here's a way we could define the lookup procedure.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It takes 2 inputs, the index and a keyword.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And as a reminder, I have drawn the structure of the index here.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It's a list, each element in the list in an entry.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Each entry is a list itself.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Where the first part of the list is a keyword.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The second part is a list of URLs.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So what we want to do to the fine lookup is very similar to

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
what we did for add to index.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We want to go through the entries in the index

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
to try to find one that matches the keyword.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So letÃ¢Â€Â™s write that again.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
That's going to be a for loop, and it's going to be

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
exactly the same code as we had before.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So we are going to look through the elements in the index each time

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
we go through their loop.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The variable entry will refer to 1 of those elements.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We're going to check if the value in position zero,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
which is the keyword of that entry,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
matches the keyword we're looking for.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
When we we're defining add to index,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
what we did when we found a match was to pin the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
URL to the list of URLs associated with that keyword.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
What we want to do for lookup is different.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
All we need to do for lookup now is return the list of URLs.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And we can find that by looking in position 1 of entry.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
If we get to the end of the list without finding that keyword.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Well then we still need to return something

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and the way we describe lookup, what it should return is the empty list.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
That means there are no URLs that we've found so far

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
that contain that keyword.
