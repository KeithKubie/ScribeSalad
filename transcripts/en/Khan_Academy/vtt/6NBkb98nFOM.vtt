00:00:00.292 --> 00:00:04.874
- Let's do some more involved
examples using decimals.

00:00:04.874 --> 00:00:08.957
So, let's say we wanna
add four and 22 hundredths

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.680
to 61 and 37 hundredths.

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:18.424
Like always, I encourage
you to pause the video

00:00:18.424 --> 00:00:21.230
and try to figure out on your own.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.974
Well the way that my
brain tries to tackle it,

00:00:23.974 --> 00:00:27.705
is it says, alright, I have
four and 22 hundredths,

00:00:27.705 --> 00:00:29.542
and 61 and 37 hundredths,

00:00:29.542 --> 00:00:33.045
how about I add the four plus the 61,

00:00:33.045 --> 00:00:35.415
so it's gonna be four plus 61,

00:00:35.415 --> 00:00:39.447
and then separately let
me add the 22 hundredths

00:00:39.447 --> 00:00:42.011
to the 37 hundredths,

00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:46.178
so then I'm gonna add 22
hundredths plus 37 hundredths,

00:00:48.917 --> 00:00:52.834
and so four plus 61 is
going to be equal to 65,

00:00:54.472 --> 00:00:58.490
and then 22 hundredths plus 37 hundredths,

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.928
well, what's 22 plus 37?

00:01:00.928 --> 00:01:03.261
Let's see, 20 plus 30 is 50,

00:01:05.102 --> 00:01:08.157
and then two plus seven is nine,

00:01:08.157 --> 00:01:11.385
and so it's going to be 59 hundredths.

00:01:11.385 --> 00:01:12.802
So 59 hundredths,

00:01:14.815 --> 00:01:17.556
so it's gonna be 65 and 59 hundredths,

00:01:17.556 --> 00:01:21.139
which we can write as
65 and 59 hundredths.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.854
Now like I've mentioned
in previous videos,

00:01:26.854 --> 00:01:29.423
there's many different
ways of adding decimals,

00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:31.367
and in future videos we'll learn

00:01:31.367 --> 00:01:33.360
arguably faster ways of doing it,

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.413
but I wanna show you multiple ways

00:01:35.413 --> 00:01:38.352
so you get a sense of ways to approach it,

00:01:38.352 --> 00:01:40.707
and this is the way
that I do it in my head

00:01:40.707 --> 00:01:44.776
if someone said hey,
something cost $61.37,

00:01:44.776 --> 00:01:47.919
and then you had to pay $4.22 in tax,

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:49.387
how much did you have to pay in total,

00:01:49.387 --> 00:01:51.851
this is how I would
actually do it in my head,

00:01:51.851 --> 00:01:53.434
I would get $65.59.

00:01:55.203 --> 00:01:57.286
Let's do another example.

00:01:58.391 --> 00:02:02.558
So let's say that we have
three and 53 hundredths,

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:09.083
and we wanna add that to
four and 72 hundredths,

00:02:11.466 --> 00:02:13.337
like always, pause this video

00:02:13.337 --> 00:02:16.417
and see if you can figure
it out on your own.

00:02:16.417 --> 00:02:17.810
So like we did in the previous example,

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.007
we can say alright, we could add the ones,

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:23.362
three ones plus four ones,

00:02:23.362 --> 00:02:25.738
so it's gonna be three plus four,

00:02:25.738 --> 00:02:27.687
and then we could add the hundredths,

00:02:27.687 --> 00:02:30.687
and we could say plus 53 hundredths,

00:02:31.756 --> 00:02:33.339
plus 53 hundredths,

00:02:35.084 --> 00:02:36.667
plus 72 hundredths,

00:02:38.632 --> 00:02:40.215
plus 72 hundredths,

00:02:42.013 --> 00:02:44.486
now the three plus four
is pretty straightforward,

00:02:44.486 --> 00:02:46.150
that's just going to be ...

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.995
Yup, blue color,

00:02:47.995 --> 00:02:51.072
this is just going to be equal to seven,

00:02:51.072 --> 00:02:55.324
but what is 53 hundredths
plus 72 hundredths?

00:02:55.324 --> 00:02:57.324
Well, what's 53 plus 72?

00:03:02.123 --> 00:03:03.225
I'm going to write it this way,

00:03:03.225 --> 00:03:06.058
this is 53 hundredths, hundredths,

00:03:07.526 --> 00:03:09.693
and this is 72 hundredths,

00:03:12.572 --> 00:03:16.739
well, three plus two is
going to be equal to five,

00:03:17.794 --> 00:03:20.794
and then 50 plus 70 is equal to 120,

00:03:24.022 --> 00:03:27.189
so this is going to be 125 hundredths,

00:03:29.734 --> 00:03:30.984
125 hundredths,

00:03:32.002 --> 00:03:35.962
so how we write 125
hundredths as a decimal

00:03:35.962 --> 00:03:38.051
or just as a number?

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:40.423
Well, there's a couple of
ways to think about it,

00:03:40.423 --> 00:03:43.590
you could view this as 100 hundredths,

00:03:46.187 --> 00:03:47.104
hundredths,

00:03:48.125 --> 00:03:51.375
plus 25 hundredths, plus 25 hundredths,

00:03:52.508 --> 00:03:54.152
and the reason why I
picked 100 hundredths,

00:03:54.152 --> 00:03:56.912
is because 100 hundredths make a whole,

00:03:56.912 --> 00:03:58.748
plus 25 hundredths,

00:03:58.748 --> 00:04:01.692
and so 100 hundredths
is just going to be one,

00:04:01.692 --> 00:04:04.513
so this is going to be
one plus 25 hundredths,

00:04:04.513 --> 00:04:07.513
so I could write this one plus 0.25,

00:04:08.496 --> 00:04:10.405
and remember, I'm adding
that to the seven here,

00:04:10.405 --> 00:04:12.090
so it's gonna be seven,

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.173
plus the one, plus the 25 hundredths,

00:04:18.265 --> 00:04:21.990
so when we added the 53
hundredths plus the 72 hundredths,

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.046
we got 125 hundredths,

00:04:24.046 --> 00:04:27.227
which is the same thing
as one and 25 hundredths,

00:04:27.227 --> 00:04:31.804
now, the one, we could add in
the ones to the other ones,

00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:34.645
and so this is going to be seven plus one,

00:04:34.645 --> 00:04:38.812
is equal to eight, eight
and 25 hundredths, so 8.25.

00:04:42.386 --> 00:04:44.490
Now, I'm going to
introduce you a little bit

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.898
to how people might tackle
this more systematically,

00:04:46.898 --> 00:04:48.129
and I want you to think about

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:51.344
how this is the exact same
thing that we just did.

00:04:51.344 --> 00:04:53.000
So what you're going to see in the future

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.433
is people are gonna say oh
you line up the decimals,

00:04:55.433 --> 00:04:56.933
so 3.53 plus 4.72,

00:04:58.998 --> 00:05:00.728
and the reason why people
say line up the decimals

00:05:00.728 --> 00:05:02.654
is so that you're adding the right places

00:05:02.654 --> 00:05:04.821
to the right places, 4.72,

00:05:05.656 --> 00:05:07.211
and then they say alright,

00:05:07.211 --> 00:05:10.533
we'll just go place by
place and add it up,

00:05:10.533 --> 00:05:12.441
which is essentially what we just did

00:05:12.441 --> 00:05:15.865
without doing it as
organized of a way here,

00:05:15.865 --> 00:05:17.777
and I did it this way
so that you really get

00:05:17.777 --> 00:05:20.163
the understanding of what's going on.

00:05:20.163 --> 00:05:21.365
But you could say alright,

00:05:21.365 --> 00:05:23.957
I have three hundredths
plus two hundredths,

00:05:23.957 --> 00:05:26.471
so I'm adding in the hundredths place,

00:05:26.471 --> 00:05:29.897
so three hundredths plus two
hundredths is five hundredths,

00:05:29.897 --> 00:05:32.665
and then you could say okay, then I have

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:34.473
50 hundredths plus 70 hundredths,

00:05:34.473 --> 00:05:36.198
which I did over here,

00:05:36.198 --> 00:05:40.576
or you could view this as
five tenths plus seven tenths,

00:05:40.576 --> 00:05:42.989
and five tenths and seven tenths

00:05:42.989 --> 00:05:46.117
is going to be equal to 12 tenths,

00:05:46.117 --> 00:05:49.597
but you can't write 12
tenths in the tenths place,

00:05:49.597 --> 00:05:52.086
but what you can do,

00:05:52.086 --> 00:05:55.600
so five plus seven is
going to be 12 tenths,

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.832
but 12 tenths is the same
thing as one and two tenths,

00:05:59.832 --> 00:06:03.371
so you can write the two
tenths in the tenths place,

00:06:03.371 --> 00:06:04.993
and then you take the one

00:06:04.993 --> 00:06:06.968
and you put it in the ones place,

00:06:06.968 --> 00:06:09.687
so five tenths plus seven tenths

00:06:09.687 --> 00:06:12.337
is one and two tenths,

00:06:12.337 --> 00:06:14.392
and then you add the ones up,

00:06:14.392 --> 00:06:19.009
and so you get one plus
three plus four is eight,

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:22.804
so it's eight and two
tenths and five hundredths,

00:06:22.804 --> 00:06:25.804
or eight and 25 hundredths, or 8.25,

00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:29.637
the exact same thing any way
that you try to tackle it,

00:06:29.637 --> 00:06:31.993
but hopefully it makes sense
what's actually going on,

00:06:31.993 --> 00:06:33.865
you're adding hundredths to hundredths,

00:06:33.865 --> 00:06:36.710
tenths to tenths, ones to ones,

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.092
and when, say you add tenths to tenths,

00:06:40.092 --> 00:06:42.573
and you get something
that's larger than one,

00:06:42.573 --> 00:06:45.783
well, that part that is a whole number,

00:06:45.783 --> 00:06:47.840
you can put in the ones place,

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.172
and we'll get much much
more practice with this

00:06:50.172 --> 00:06:51.589
in future videos.
