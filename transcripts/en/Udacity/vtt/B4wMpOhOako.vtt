00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[D. Evans] The purpose of Backus-Naur Form is to be able to precisely describe

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
exactly the language in a way that's very simple and very concise.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So each rule has the form like this where on the left side there's a non-terminal.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Non-terminal means something that we're not finished with.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
All the words written in blue in the grammar are non-terminals.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Sometimes they're written with brackets around them.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I've just used blue to distinguish the non-terminals like this.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Then there's an arrow, and then on the right side there's a replacement.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The replacement can be anything.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It can be a sequence of non-terminals like here.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Sentence can be replaced with subject followed by verb followed by object.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It can be 1 non-terminal like here.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It can also be a terminal, and the terminals I've written in black.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
What's special about the terminals is they never appear on the left side of a rule.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Once we get to a terminal, we're done, we're finished.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
There's nothing else we can replace it with.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So all the rules have this form.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We can form a sentence by starting from some non-terminal,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
usually whichever one is written at the top left--

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
in this case the one I called sentence.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And then by following the rules we keep replacing non-terminals with their replacements

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
until we're left with only terminals.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Here's an example starting from sentence using the grammar above.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We can start with sentence.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
We only have 1 rule to choose from where sentence is on the left side,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
so we're going to replace sentence with subject, verb, object.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Now we have a lot of choices.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
We can pick any of the non-terminals we have left.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Find a rule where that non-terminal is on the left side.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
We can pick any of the rules where it's on the left side and do the replacement.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
So I'm going to start with the left one. We'll pick subject.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
We only have 1 replacement rule for subject.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
We can replace subject with noun.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
The others stay like they are, so we still have verb and we still have object.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Now we can keep going.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
We can pick the first one again.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
It's still a non-terminal, so we can still do replacements.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
With noun we've got 3 choices.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
We can pick any one of those choices.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I'm going to pick the first one. We'll replace noun with the terminal I.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Now we've got a terminal. We're done with that replacement.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Verb and object stay the same.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I'm running out of space, so I'm not going to write them again

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
because now we can use rules to replace verb.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
As a separate step we're going to find a rule that matches verb.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
We have 2 choices. I'll pick the second one and replace verb with like.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
We still have object.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Object is a non-terminal, so we have to keep replacing it until we're done.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
We have 1 rule for object. We can replace object with noun.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Now we have 3 rules for noun. I'm going to pick the second rule and replace noun with Python.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
What I've done here is what's called a derivation.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
A derivation just means starting from some non-terminal,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
follow the rules to derive a sequence of terminals.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
We're done when we have only terminals left

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and we can derive a sentence in the grammar.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
In this case we produced the sentence I like python,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
but there are lots of other sentences we could have produced

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
starting from the same non-terminal if we pick different rules to follow.
