00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.070
DAN GALPIN: So I
wanted to begin.

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.310
My job is basically to be awake
this early in the morning.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.550
I'm usually very funny when
I haven't had much sleep.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.490
And this is always an
exciting week, the week of IO.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.155
So I actually wrote
my name in the notes,

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:17.530
just so I'd remember
to say them.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.930
Because this is
usually a time when

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.330
we're just running around,
trying to get everything

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.160
ready for tomorrow.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.050
And this is always a
really fun thing to do,

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.740
to meet with you guys today.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.210
And so I'm really excited
that Bill asked me to be here.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.250
I've been doing this
for a really long time.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.670
I've been working to make
Android development better,

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.940
delivering some modestly
memorable presentations,

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.520
and occasionally, maybe more
memorable looks over the years.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.228
I particularly like
the Jean Valjean look

00:00:44.228 --> 00:00:48.492
I have on the left, over there.

00:00:48.492 --> 00:00:50.950
So the first thing I like to
do is summarize all the things

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.210
that I thought were cool
about the day we had at GDC.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.050
And so how many people,
by a show of hands,

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.095
actually attended and saw
all of our GDC sessions?

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.290
All right.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.325
Well, that's usually
about what I expected.

00:01:05.325 --> 00:01:06.200
That's why I do this.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.270
And I grouped these to
kind of help myself.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.040
So we talked about
a lot of things

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.820
about what Google Play is doing.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.570
So I'll put my
Google Play hat on.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.940
We mentioned that in
the last 12 months,

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.550
the number of Android users
who installed a game more than

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.260
doubled, compared to
the previous year,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.660
and 40% of that growth is
coming from these emerging

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:32.180
markets, such as Brazil,
India, Indonesia, and Mexico.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.000
We recognize that because
about half of mobile gamers

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.120
are women we kicked off
an initiative to celebrate

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.910
and empower women as
players and creators.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.220
We did a lot of stuff
inside the store

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.990
to actually improve the
way that people find games.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.874
We improved search on
play with personalization,

00:01:49.874 --> 00:01:51.290
such as the search
refinements you

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.981
see on the left and
recommendations on the right.

00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:56.480
Nice!

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.760
That is because I'm
running a dev version.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.632
I swear, hilarious.

00:02:08.632 --> 00:02:10.340
This is what happens
when you have to run

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.812
the unstable version of Chrome.

00:02:12.812 --> 00:02:14.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.860
All right.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.100
I have no idea what's
going to happen there.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.075
That was pretty cool.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.200
This is why live
presentations are really fun.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.810
I am going to try
to kill everything

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:31.686
that's not important.

00:02:31.686 --> 00:02:33.310
And I'm hoping that
won't happen again.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.910
But, if it does,
we'll roll with it.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.125
All right, let's go back.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.490
I thought this would be so cool!

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.280
I did this last year
on my Chromebook

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.340
running the latest version,
but this is just, uh--

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.430
all right.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.060
Let me pull that off
and start over again.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.560
Where was I?

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.060
I was talking about something
about Google Play, I remember.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.680
AUDIENCE: You said
better search.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.610
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, better search.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.700
We had-- let me try
this one more time.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.630
That's amazing.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.360
Thank you all for
putting up with me.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.570
And this-- real fun.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.190
Maybe next time I'll actually--

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.620
oh, no!

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.680
Now it's all-- this
is turned back on?

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.765
All right, that's OK.

00:03:21.765 --> 00:03:22.920
AUDIENCE: You want
to switch to this?

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.670
DAN GALPIN: Yeah,
maybe I should--

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.590
Joe, why don't you put
it up on the laptop.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.630
We'll switch over once I--

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:28.680
give me two seconds here.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.050
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, sure.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.790
DAN GALPIN: OK.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.123
We might do a switch in between.

00:03:31.123 --> 00:03:35.310
If it crashes again, then I'm
going to switch over to that.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.770
This does not happen on the
release versions, by the way.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:38.642
Trust me.

00:03:38.642 --> 00:03:39.600
Our software's perfect.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.594
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:42.594 --> 00:03:44.590
AUDIENCE: Will it
happen on my machine?

00:03:48.062 --> 00:03:49.520
DAN GALPIN: Well,
the nice thing is

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.770
I could move to another
machine really quickly.

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.710
This is why I should
have redundant machines,

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.880
clearly, when I'm doing this.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.490
All right, let's go back.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.160
All right, blah blah blah,
lots of animations about IO

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.400
that are probably making it
run out of memory, hands,

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.310
play updates.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.400
We're going with
lots of expansion.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.330
We're doing some cool stuff with
search, personalized search.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.871
One of the things
we've done is we've

00:04:13.871 --> 00:04:16.690
actually elevated games
as its own destination,

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.860
in Google Play.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.570
And that's really
important because it's

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.486
a foundation for creating
a lot of experiences

00:04:21.486 --> 00:04:23.200
in the story that
are unique to games--

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.940
such as more immersive
recommendations,

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.180
like showing trailers or
screenshots of actual gameplay.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.940
And we also want to give users
a lot more control on how

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.020
they explore the catalog.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.395
And one of the things that
I'm particularly excited about

00:04:34.395 --> 00:04:37.030
is that we now have a premium
section, which is highlighting

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.320
only paid games.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.900
And we launched that in Q4, and
we're refreshing it regularly.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.230
And this is also really good,
because, as you all know,

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.300
we actually have strikethrough
sale pricing now.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.284
So it's a good way for users
to go and find this content

00:04:49.284 --> 00:04:50.200
that they really want.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.210
And we see a lot of engagement
with visitors going deeper

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.552
into the page, looking
at premium content.

00:04:57.552 --> 00:05:00.010
Within our recommendations,
we're also clearly highlighting

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.122
the best of the catalog.

00:05:01.122 --> 00:05:02.830
And one of the major
focuses of this year

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.000
is actually creating new
editorial experiences,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.759
including this rich,
long-form content

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:10.300
that explains to users actually
what we love about the games.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.560
So not only do you
see editors' choice,

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.185
but you actually see
a couple of things

00:05:13.185 --> 00:05:14.770
about why we actually did that.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.125
And these articles are
now live in 17 countries.

00:05:18.125 --> 00:05:20.000
And discovering new
games is really important

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.980
not just to developers
but to gamers.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.140
And so similar to the
way we did with premium,

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.360
we actually rolled out
a section dedicated

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.100
to high-quality new games.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.420
And this is pretty cool.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.990
This is a
preregistration feature.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.120
And this is called
Milestone Rewards, here,

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.070
for preregistration--
which is pretty awesome.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.850
So this is a way in which
we're incentivizing people

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.630
to actually go and
preregister for games.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.040
And that is really great.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.367
It also should be a destination
for people to find out

00:05:50.367 --> 00:05:51.450
about the games they have.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.220
We spend so much time in live
ops trying to drive people back

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:54.980
to content.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.890
That's the way the
game world works now.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.550
And so we've actually started to
highlight major in-game events

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.080
and these live
operations to the way

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.580
we're doing store featuring.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.620
And they're exploring a lot
of ways to use live ops.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.980
And this has been a pilot
program for several months,

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.438
and we're seeing
promising results.

00:06:10.438 --> 00:06:12.820
And so hopefully more of you
will get to take part of it.

00:06:15.989 --> 00:06:17.530
One of the things
we're also piloting

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:22.160
is these updates to the detailed
pages, which is pretty cool.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.160
So this will actually
change depending on

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.360
whether or not the user
actually has the game installed.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.561
So you'll actually see things
that are new and interesting

00:06:31.561 --> 00:06:32.560
that are more important.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.230
You already have
the game installed,

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:35.900
and you may not have
run it for a while.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.345
Or, if you are going to
install it, potentially

00:06:38.345 --> 00:06:39.970
then you'll see things
that'll actually

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.574
be more attractive, like
videos and stuff like that.

00:06:42.574 --> 00:06:44.740
So once again, it's trying
to personalize the store,

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.770
trying to get people to go
and reengage with content

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.380
through the Play Store.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.080
We also fully redesigned
the Play Games app,

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.260
which looks really nice.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:57.970
And this allows users
to really launch

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:59.180
the games they've installed.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.830
And we've added a number of
game reengagement features.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.540
And so in addition to tracking,
leaderboards, and achievements,

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:08.170
users can now see live ops,
related news, and game YouTube

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:08.920
videos.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.420
And we also have a new arcade--

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.404
prominently features this
tag browsing experience--

00:07:13.404 --> 00:07:15.070
to help people find
their favorite game,

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:16.510
which is pretty cool.

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.610
And these updates
are all leading

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.020
to a lot of user engagement.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.500
And that's very important
as we continue to invest

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.341
in this surface this year.

00:07:26.341 --> 00:07:28.840
And we also added this little
thing that maybe you have seen

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:34.749
called Google Play Instant,
which is really, really fun

00:07:34.749 --> 00:07:35.290
to play with.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.220
And I highly recommend
trying it out.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:38.950
And when you click
Try Now, you actually

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:40.640
get the native application.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.130
So if you've played this
with Clash, it's really cool.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:44.380
It's a great experience.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.920
And you get an
option to install.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.390
So you get a whole
bunch of levels.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.360
A lot of these games give
you a lot of gameplay

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.580
and then really, really drive
the ability for people to very,

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:56.470
very quickly jump into games
and install them right away.

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:58.510
So those are all
the promotion things

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:00.385
we're doing-- those that
help people discover

00:08:00.385 --> 00:08:03.190
games, those that help
people reengage in content.

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:08.149
We're also doing a lot of
things with testing on Play.

00:08:08.149 --> 00:08:09.940
This is something I'm
really excited about.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.410
We have internal test tracks.

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:15.010
So one of the challenges,
obviously, is you upload--

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.890
it goes through a process
before it actually goes live.

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:21.310
With internal test
track, with 100 users,

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:22.850
things go live
very, very quickly.

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:24.600
So you can iterate
really, really rapidly.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.500
You don't have to
wait for Google Play

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.810
to spend a lot of time
staging things and going

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:29.860
through your content.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.240
Which is great-- makes it
really fast to use play.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.990
And I think this is going
to really help people.

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:38.530
We also have country
targeting per track now,

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.480
which is awesome.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.059
So if you haven't used this,
I'm sure that you'll love it.

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:44.600
Because this is
something that people

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.420
have been asking us for forever.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:50.150
So I'm really
excited about that.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:52.459
And this is something
that's coming soon, I think.

00:08:52.459 --> 00:08:54.250
I'm not sure exactly
when it's coming soon,

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:59.050
but this actually allows you to
create prerecorded demo loops

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:02.530
and use them for prelaunch
report, which is pretty slick.

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:06.130
You'll see you'll get crash and
performance metrics, including

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:06.920
frames per second.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.295
And this will
hopefully allow you

00:09:08.295 --> 00:09:10.450
to discover issues
even faster and launch

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:13.750
with more confidence.

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:16.900
I talked a bit about ARcore
and what we're doing there.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.960
It's currently compatible with a
lot of devices, which is great,

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.850
and more are coming, on the way.

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:25.510
We have a lot of partners
involved with ARcore,

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:27.920
bringing the power of
AR to game developers.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.660
Which is something that I think
is going to be pretty fun.

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.130
And one of the
things that's great

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:34.505
is it's actually
coming to China.

00:09:34.505 --> 00:09:38.230
So we're actually working to
make ARcore work in China,

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:39.910
actually making sure
that the product is

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:43.840
available through these
app stores in China--

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:48.670
with Huawei,
Xiaomi, and Samsung.

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:51.880
We also have native
SDKs for popular IEs,

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.447
whether you're using
Android Studio or Unity or--

00:09:55.447 --> 00:09:57.280
I don't really think
of those as being IDEs,

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.661
but this is what their
slide said, I swear.

00:09:59.661 --> 00:10:01.160
We also have this
thing called Poly.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.327
How many people know about Poly?

00:10:03.327 --> 00:10:05.410
This is a product we have
to actually allow people

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:09.310
to build and browse 3D assets.

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:10.810
So you can find
all sorts of stuff

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:14.080
on there, from the landing
model of a space shuttle,

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.900
to apparently a mustache
over in the corner.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.870
And what's really
cool about Poly

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:21.370
is that it actually
allows you to build these

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:24.280
in VR, which is pretty slick.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:27.340
And we also added an API.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.050
So literally, you
can go to Poly,

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:31.030
and your app can
actually pull assets.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:33.130
Most of these assets are
Creative Commons license

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:33.570
for free.

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:34.945
You can just use
them everywhere.

00:10:34.945 --> 00:10:36.910
And it's really a great
way to get started.

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:39.460
If you're prototyping games,
it's an awesome thing to have.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.645
Or if you want to have
user-generated content

00:10:41.645 --> 00:10:43.270
and you want to have
a source for that,

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:44.570
this could be pretty fun.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:48.050
So I'm excited about that.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:50.860
We also announced
Google Maps Gaming,

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.390
which is a pretty big deal.

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:56.140
So I have much
prettier slides here--

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.540
hopefully they won't crash--

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:02.950
which goes through a little
bit of the kind of things

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:04.490
you can do.

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:06.580
You can actually game
in the real world.

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.590
You can completely
customize this game world

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:12.010
with all sorts of-- fill
parks with trees, turn rivers

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:13.300
into lava flows.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:17.440
You can customize
textures or swap out

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.660
entire features for
prefabs to create

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.850
this kind of
world-scale environment

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:24.020
that's true to the look
and feel of your game.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:27.310
So it really is pretty awesome.

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:29.500
I've been excited that
we're announcing this--

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.780
we've launched
this, I should say.

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:34.990
And you can also design
gameplay around real places.

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:38.980
So you can actually drive your
players to popular places,

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.180
take them off the beaten path.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.982
And we actually help
you find great places

00:11:43.982 --> 00:11:45.940
for your unique gameplay
anywhere in the world.

00:11:49.062 --> 00:11:51.270
And, of course, you can
deliver these at global scale

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:54.330
because it's running on
Google's infrastructure.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.930
So that should give you a
little bit of peace of mind.

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:59.430
We've done a lot of stuff with
Firebase for game developers,

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:00.510
too.

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:02.670
You know, probably,
as you see, Firebase

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:03.950
includes all of these things.

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:05.070
I'm not going to talk
about all of them

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:06.660
because I have,
like, five minutes.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.740
But this is our mobile
development platform.

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:13.590
It's a single SDK that combines
tons and tons of stuff.

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:17.400
And they really
work together well.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.980
Probably the feature that's
most useful, other than maybe

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:23.130
Crashlytics, is Google
Analytics for Firebase.

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.930
This product has really,
really grown a lot, recently.

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:27.990
I don't know if
you've played with it.

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:30.700
It has fantastic
real-time support now.

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.700
It's wonderful, when
you're going and debugging,

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.220
to see the analytics, that
analytics data flowing in

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.660
really quickly.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.610
And if you're selling
a premium game,

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:42.771
it's really important, of
course, to understand--

00:12:42.771 --> 00:12:44.520
or a freemium game--
to really understand,

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.228
really important to
understand how people

00:12:46.228 --> 00:12:47.530
are engaging with your content.

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:50.550
And you can measure all this
behavior at no cost to you.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:53.010
We added this Predictions API.

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:55.680
This is something we
released in beta last year.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:59.220
And this actually
allows you to-- this

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.130
builds dynamic user groups based
upon predicted behavior, which

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:03.520
is pretty slick.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.240
So you can actually
then target these groups

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.520
using Firebase Cloud
Messaging and a product called

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.110
Remote Config.

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:12.090
And out of the box you
can find predictions

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:14.890
for users who are predicted
to soft churn, users

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:17.370
who are predicted to not
churn, spend or not spend--

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:19.470
all that sort of thing.

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.580
Which, I think, is
really important.

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:27.180
We also, as I said, allow you
to experiment with these users

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.260
with Remote Config.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.810
So in this case, this
is for Mecha Hamster,

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:31.980
which is one of our samples.

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:34.890
But you can see how this works.

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:37.290
Depending on whether
someone is going to churn

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:39.360
or whether someone is
a dedicated player,

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.880
we can offer them different
incentives to continue playing.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:46.670
And you can use it to change
any parameters in your game--

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:48.900
like UI, ad
placement, difficulty,

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:51.180
whatever you can imagine.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.640
And out of the box we actually
have this web-based composer

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.750
for notifications.

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:57.870
We also have a Rest API, so you
can integrate Firebase Cloud

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.510
Messaging into tools
that you maintain.

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:03.020
And we also have
rewarded ad formats.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:05.760
Yay!

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.370
So that's really great.

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:10.920
Obviously, we have
rewarded playables, which

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.560
involves try before you buy.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.900
And we also have rewarded
with multiple options.

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:21.690
So this gives the
ability to watch an ad

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:25.020
and then choose kind of what
reward the user's going to get.

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:26.940
And we know this is important.

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.590
We know that ads are
important for developers

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:37.470
to make sure they're monetizing
a lot of these players that

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:39.720
are very dedicated.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.900
We also have this open-bidding
beta that we're doing,

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.390
which takes the promise of
monetization to the next level,

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:46.855
allows people to actually--

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:53.190
allows network partners to bid
for inventory simultaneously

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:54.840
and in real time.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.646
So that is pretty cool!

00:14:56.646 --> 00:14:58.020
And then the final
thing I wanted

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:00.600
to mention that we talked
about is that we've been really

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:04.140
working on making Google
Cloud work really, really

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:08.220
fast for people that are doing
things like real-time PvP.

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:11.580
And so Dragon Ball Legends
announced that they

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:12.600
are using it for that.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.058
And I thought that
was pretty cool,

00:15:14.058 --> 00:15:17.160
so I thought I'd end with that
for my component of the slides

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.550
and leave Bill to come
up here and tell us

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:24.270
a little bit about what he
does with partner-developer

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:26.160
relations and what they do.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.580
So hopefully this will
continue to work for him.

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.950
So thank you, everyone.

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:33.638
[APPLAUSE]
