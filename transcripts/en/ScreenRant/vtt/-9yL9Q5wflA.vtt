00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.090
When we think of a Superhero we usually think
of their superpowers such as Superman’s

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.630
ability to fly or Spiderman’s skill to shoot
webbing. Every child has dreamed of having

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.699
these skills and being able to fight crime
but superpowers are not the only way a superhero

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:22.519
is defined as a superhero. If it was numerous
villains could be defined as a superhero too.

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.839
These unique personality traits, skills and
qualities are what make up superheroes and

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:30.419
sometimes the actors that play them possess
them too.

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.940
Subscribe to Screen Rant, as we introduce
you to Screen Rant’s list of ten Superhero

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.830
Actors Who Can Do Superhero Things.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.690
Jennifer Garner as Elektra

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.800
Jennifer Garner showed her skills as the star
of the TV series Alias from 2001-2006 as CIA

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.210
Agent Sydney Bristow ​and as the assassin
Elektra Natchios in the 2003 film Daredevil

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.080
and the 2005 spin-off Elektra. She had a tremendous
work ethic, training, and plan to make her

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.740
roles believable but none more than her training
with Okinawan sai, Elektra’s usual weapon

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.610
of choice. These blades are dangerous but
Garner practiced daily while shooting to look

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.990
like a master on film and can still use them
to this day.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.820
Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.240
The bow-wielding superhero Hawkeye looks at
ease when shooting a bow in The Avengers films

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.550
for a reason. Renner trained under Olympic
archers to boost his skills to ensure he was

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.950
able to use a bow and arrow. Renner has said
that being a traditional straight-shooter

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.340
isn’t all that he needed to know while using
an arrow. The Avengers hero also pulverizes

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:41.451
his enemies by using his bow, as a blunt weapon
and spinning it like a baton too. Another

00:01:41.451 --> 00:01:44.930
skill he has picked up along the way.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.760
Nicolas Cage as Ghost Rider

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.090
Nicholas Cage’s Johnny Blaze is a stunt
motorcyclist who sold his soul to the Devil

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.700
and transformed into the vigilante Ghost Rider.
Even though his face didn’t into a skull

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.830
and catch on fire in real life, he was an
avid motorcyclist. He caused so much trouble

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.900
on his motorcycle that his insurance company
told him he wasn’t allowed to ride anymore.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.009
So he eagerly looks for films that he gets
to ride a motorcycle in because he enjoys

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.500
it so much.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.220
Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.420
Ryan Reynold’s quick wit, dirty jokes and
sarcastic attitude are why fans are eager

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.640
to see him play the role of Deadpool again.
Luckily he has the same mindset as his superhero

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.731
character or we would never have seen his
2016 hit film. Reynolds is persistent! It

00:02:27.731 --> 00:02:31.770
took him a decade to get the film Deadpool
made but he kept at it just like the revenge

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.160
his character perused in the film. He better
keep that persistence and give us a few more

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.190
sequels to Deadpool or we will be persistent
with bothering him for them.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.040
Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.910
Gal Gadot first portrayed Wonder Woman in
2016’s Batman Vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.000
and she proved to the world she was flawless
for the role. Maybe this has to do with her

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.760
two-year stretch in the Israeli Defense Forces
where she was trained in weapons and combat

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.160
training. Wonder Woman fights against evil
just like Gadot was trained to. Next time

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:10.210
you see Gadot on screen battling a villain,
remember she can do that in real life too.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.480
Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.820
Dr. Bruce Banner becomes the Hulk in times
of stress and unleashes a destructive anger

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.150
known as the Hulk. In an interview with&nbsp;New
York Daily News, Mark Ruffalo said that he

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.590
could relate to the Hulk because he had a
lot of&nbsp;anger issues&nbsp;in his 20s. Ruffalo

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.560
said, “There was a time if you came into
my apartment, there were pictures and posters

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.240
hanging in very odd places where they were
covering fist-holes through walls.” We are

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.730
glad he was able to use that anger in The
Avengers films and stop punching holes in

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.410
walls.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.319
Hugh Jackman as Wolverine

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.540
Hugh Jackman is arguable the best actor to
play Wolverine and since he has been playing

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.170
the character for over 12 years we feel the
fans and studio agree. Not only does he prepare

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.390
with ruthless workouts but he also has trained
in martial arts; including samurai sword fighting.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.360
Jackman’s skills as a martial artist make
his role more believable and give us another

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.080
reason to not want to mess with him in real
life. We will miss him as Wolverine.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.159
Robert Downey Jr. as Ironman

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:14.060
Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark, and when
he dies his tombstone will most likely have

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.229
both names on it. He’s rich, has a fashion
flare, knows how to throw a party and he attributes

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:24.530
much of his success to his father. Still in
real-life he has hero instincts. When a woman

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:30.080
gashed her leg badly and onlookers stood shocked,
it was Downey who took charge. He helped control

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.740
the bleeding, kept her distracted and directed
people to call an ambulance and get her water.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:42.470
He stayed until help arrived, ruining his
suit but helping a very grateful woman.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.210
Taylor Kitsch as Gambit

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.850
The film, X-Men Origins: Wolverine is arguable
the weakest of the X-Men franchise but that

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.710
doesn’t have to do with co-star Taylor Kitsch.
Taylor Kitsch had the chance to play Gambit

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.300
in the X-Men Origins: Wolverine film and show
off some of his card playing tricks. He learned

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.030
how to trick shuffle and perform card tricks
just for the role. Sadly, we wont see any

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:07.410
more card tricks from him since he isn’t
cast in the upcoming Gambit film.

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.550
Tom Holland as Spiderman

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.280
Spiderman is one of the most athletic superheroes
in the MCU due to a bite from a radioactive

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.070
spider. The newly casted Spiderman, Tom Holland
showed off some of his skills in Captain America:

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:27.940
Civil War and fans were excited to see him
perform stunts. But not all of his stunts

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:33.310
were done with cables and CGI. Holland a trained
dancer has been training with stuntmen, Holland

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.560
Diaz for his upcoming Spiderman films and
recently showed a video of himself performing

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.470
a backflip while nailing the Spiderman pose.

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.500
