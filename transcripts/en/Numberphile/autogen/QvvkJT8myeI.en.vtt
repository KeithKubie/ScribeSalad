it basically you just take n of these

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969
it basically you just take n of these
 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.990
it basically you just take n of these
guys and again now you're saying all

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000
guys and again now you're saying all
 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.220
guys and again now you're saying all
this conjecture would be there are no

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230
this conjecture would be there are no
 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.160
this conjecture would be there are no
interest integer solutions for K greater

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170
interest integer solutions for K greater
 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.709
interest integer solutions for K greater
than n now integer solutions for K

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719
than n now integer solutions for K
 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.119
than n now integer solutions for K
greater than n so of course fermat's

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129
greater than n so of course fermat's
 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.650
greater than n so of course fermat's
last theorem was the case of N equals 2

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660
last theorem was the case of N equals 2
 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.049
last theorem was the case of N equals 2
this is the general case right but this

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059
this is the general case right but this
 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.060
this is the general case right but this
is not true right this paper proves it

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070
is not true right this paper proves it
 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.520
is not true right this paper proves it
right basically in this example and is 4

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530
right basically in this example and is 4
 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.469
right basically in this example and is 4
but K is 5 disproven there you go so in

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479
but K is 5 disproven there you go so in
 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.670
but K is 5 disproven there you go so in
a nutshell did this prove but this

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680
a nutshell did this prove but this
 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.200
a nutshell did this prove but this
doesn't have the record anymore I don't

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210
doesn't have the record anymore I don't
 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.670
doesn't have the record anymore I don't
have ever did up the record it's sort of

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680
have ever did up the record it's sort of
 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.249
have ever did up the record it's sort of
a classic short paper that achieves

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259
a classic short paper that achieves
 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.499
a classic short paper that achieves
quite a lot their record is a I think

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509
quite a lot their record is a I think
 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.719
quite a lot their record is a I think
currently held by this paper by your

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729

sofa I think it isn't that's how you

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330
sofa I think it isn't that's how you
 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.060
sofa I think it isn't that's how you
pronounce it ok so the app they ask a

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070
pronounce it ok so the app they ask a
 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.219
pronounce it ok so the app they ask a
question in the tail so I think that's a

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229
question in the tail so I think that's a
 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.690
question in the tail so I think that's a
bit of a cheat and then err so they're

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700
bit of a cheat and then err so they're
 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.490
bit of a cheat and then err so they're
basically asking about how many trying

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500
basically asking about how many trying
 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.960
basically asking about how many trying
how many equilateral triangles you need

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970
how many equilateral triangles you need
 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.730
how many equilateral triangles you need
to cover an equilateral triangle of a

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740
to cover an equilateral triangle of a
 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.890
to cover an equilateral triangle of a
given size so basically the paper just

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900
given size so basically the paper just
 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.960
given size so basically the paper just
says N squared plus 2 can and then it

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970
says N squared plus 2 can and then it
 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.300
says N squared plus 2 can and then it
has a picture of their solution so it's

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310
has a picture of their solution so it's
 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.859
has a picture of their solution so it's
kind of like got two words in it right

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869
kind of like got two words in it right
 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.569
kind of like got two words in it right
the add the following question right so

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579
the add the following question right so
 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.600
the add the following question right so
you take an equilateral triangle and you

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610
you take an equilateral triangle and you
 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.480
you take an equilateral triangle and you
imagine it it's got a length of side end

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490
imagine it it's got a length of side end
 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.859
imagine it it's got a length of side end
and then you could ask well how many

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869
and then you could ask well how many
 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.609
and then you could ask well how many
triangles of side one you know so unit

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619
triangles of side one you know so unit
 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.530
triangles of side one you know so unit
side triangles equilateral triangles do

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540
side triangles equilateral triangles do
 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.469
side triangles equilateral triangles do
I need to fill it to cover it well you

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479
I need to fill it to cover it well you
 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.450
I need to fill it to cover it well you
know the answer it turns out to be N

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460
know the answer it turns out to be N
 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.119
know the answer it turns out to be N
squared it's quite easy to see that show

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129
squared it's quite easy to see that show
 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.820
squared it's quite easy to see that show
you by example if you've got side - so

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830
you by example if you've got side - so
 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.760
you by example if you've got side - so
we've got side - you know we can

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770
we've got side - you know we can
 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.030
we've got side - you know we can
fill it with four equilateral triangles

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040
fill it with four equilateral triangles
 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.130
fill it with four equilateral triangles
like that so these are all got side 1

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140
like that so these are all got side 1
 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.900
like that so these are all got side 1
and they felt but four of them fairly

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910
and they felt but four of them fairly
 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.790
and they felt but four of them fairly
equal uh triangle of side 2 which is 2

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800
equal uh triangle of side 2 which is 2
 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.470
equal uh triangle of side 2 which is 2
squared which is 2 squared exactly right

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480
squared which is 2 squared exactly right
 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.660
squared which is 2 squared exactly right
and it generalizes in it the answer is N

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670
and it generalizes in it the answer is N
 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.480
and it generalizes in it the answer is N
squared for waterside and ok so what

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490
squared for waterside and ok so what
 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.070
squared for waterside and ok so what
these guys wanted to know is what if we

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080
these guys wanted to know is what if we
 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.630
these guys wanted to know is what if we
make it a little bit bigger than n

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640
make it a little bit bigger than n
 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.270
make it a little bit bigger than n
naught n plus 1 but but just a little

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280
naught n plus 1 but but just a little
 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.400
naught n plus 1 but but just a little
bit bigger than n so n plus Epsilon I

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410
bit bigger than n so n plus Epsilon I
 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.690
bit bigger than n so n plus Epsilon I
mean you need them

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700
mean you need them
 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.790
mean you need them
ok so you might think I know I'm going

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800
ok so you might think I know I'm going
 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.740
ok so you might think I know I'm going
to need more than N squared because I've

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750
to need more than N squared because I've
 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.170
to need more than N squared because I've
gone N squared would cover the original

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180
gone N squared would cover the original
 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.670
gone N squared would cover the original
one right but so I'm going to need more

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680
one right but so I'm going to need more
 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.630
one right but so I'm going to need more
than that so I'm going to need at least

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640
than that so I'm going to need at least
 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.330
than that so I'm going to need at least
n squared plus 1 so they were asking all

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340
n squared plus 1 so they were asking all
 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.490
n squared plus 1 so they were asking all
can you do with N squared plus 1 and

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500
can you do with N squared plus 1 and
 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.930
can you do with N squared plus 1 and
they didn't actually answer the question

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940
they didn't actually answer the question
 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.370
they didn't actually answer the question
they say actually you need n squared

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380
they say actually you need n squared
 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.430
they say actually you need n squared
plus 2 how do they show that well what

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440
plus 2 how do they show that well what
 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.530
plus 2 how do they show that well what
you do is you sort of stop it at n minus

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540
you do is you sort of stop it at n minus
 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.200
you do is you sort of stop it at n minus
1 so you draw consider n minus 1 there

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210
1 so you draw consider n minus 1 there
 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.430
1 so you draw consider n minus 1 there
ok and then you've got a little bit

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440
ok and then you've got a little bit
 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.420
ok and then you've got a little bit
there of 1 plus epsilon to go little

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430
there of 1 plus epsilon to go little
 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.470
there of 1 plus epsilon to go little
every 1 plus epsilon bit there ok now

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480
every 1 plus epsilon bit there ok now
 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.100
every 1 plus epsilon bit there ok now
this thing this bit bit in here is going

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110
this thing this bit bit in here is going
 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.550
this thing this bit bit in here is going
to need n minus 1 squared to fill it ok

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560
to need n minus 1 squared to fill it ok
 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.650
to need n minus 1 squared to fill it ok
now what they do is they say right what

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660
now what they do is they say right what
 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.570
now what they do is they say right what
do I need to fill this a little bit left

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580
do I need to fill this a little bit left
 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.360
do I need to fill this a little bit left
over here well the way they do it is you

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370
over here well the way they do it is you
 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.460
over here well the way they do it is you
know this has got length m plus Epsilon

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470
know this has got length m plus Epsilon
 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.100
know this has got length m plus Epsilon
that way ok so you squeeze in it can't

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110
that way ok so you squeeze in it can't
 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.270
that way ok so you squeeze in it can't
you can't you're not going to cover

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280
you can't you're not going to cover
 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.630
you can't you're not going to cover
these edges with n edges of the triangle

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640
these edges with n edges of the triangle
 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.130
these edges with n edges of the triangle
right you're going to need a least n

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140
right you're going to need a least n
 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.790
right you're going to need a least n
plus 1 okay so you squeeze in n plus 1

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800
plus 1 okay so you squeeze in n plus 1
 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:56.840
plus 1 okay so you squeeze in n plus 1
of them okay like so maybe overlapping

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850
of them okay like so maybe overlapping
 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.490
of them okay like so maybe overlapping
they definitely have to overlap right

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500
they definitely have to overlap right
 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.530
they definitely have to overlap right
because M plus of Shiloh there's n plus

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540
because M plus of Shiloh there's n plus
 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.180
because M plus of Shiloh there's n plus
a tiny bit okay and you're going to

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190
a tiny bit okay and you're going to
 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.620
a tiny bit okay and you're going to
squeeze it n plus one of them so they're

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630
squeeze it n plus one of them so they're
 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.480
squeeze it n plus one of them so they're
definitely going to overlap so you get n

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490
definitely going to overlap so you get n
 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.780
definitely going to overlap so you get n
plus 1 of them there ok and you fill in

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790
plus 1 of them there ok and you fill in
 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.890
plus 1 of them there ok and you fill in
the top bits ok and to fill in the top

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900
the top bits ok and to fill in the top
 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.800
the top bits ok and to fill in the top
bits so on and so forth you need another

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810
bits so on and so forth you need another
 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.800
bits so on and so forth you need another
n ok and then you can do it

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810
n ok and then you can do it
 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.180
n ok and then you can do it
so how much have you got total now in

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190
so how much have you got total now in
 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.480
so how much have you got total now in
total you've got n minus 1 squared plus

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490
total you've got n minus 1 squared plus
 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.410
total you've got n minus 1 squared plus
n plus n plus one okay if you work out

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420
n plus n plus one okay if you work out
 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.150
n plus n plus one okay if you work out
what that is this is N squared minus 2n

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160
what that is this is N squared minus 2n
 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.800
what that is this is N squared minus 2n
plus 1 plus 2n plus 1 which is N squared

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810
plus 1 plus 2n plus 1 which is N squared
 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.560
plus 1 plus 2n plus 1 which is N squared
plus 2 the extra but you know it could

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570
plus 2 the extra but you know it could
 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.080
plus 2 the extra but you know it could
be less than two they're showing yeah so

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090
be less than two they're showing yeah so
 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.160
be less than two they're showing yeah so
this is what I think about it I don't

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170
this is what I think about it I don't
 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:46.780
this is what I think about it I don't
think they even answer the question the

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790
think they even answer the question the
 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.940
think they even answer the question the
question is can N squared plus 1 unit

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950
question is can N squared plus 1 unit
 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.140
question is can N squared plus 1 unit

they just say they don't say yes or no

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730
they just say they don't say yes or no
 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.230
they just say they don't say yes or no
they just say N squared plus two can so

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240
they just say N squared plus two can so
 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.910
they just say N squared plus two can so
maybe they could have said maybe that's

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:00.920
maybe they could have said maybe that's
 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.130
maybe they could have said maybe that's
better answer the question if you look

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140
better answer the question if you look

with aftershocks removed poissonian so

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660
with aftershocks removed poissonian so
 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.050

this is a lot of mixture of

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060
this is a lot of mixture of
 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.120
this is a lot of mixture of
mass and I guess geography but the

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.130
mass and I guess geography but the
 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:20.980
mass and I guess geography but the
answer isn't probably not it yes so that

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:20.990
answer isn't probably not it yes so that
 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.710
answer isn't probably not it yes so that
sort of goes against the the usual rules

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720
sort of goes against the the usual rules
 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.800
sort of goes against the the usual rules
of the game and but this is all it's

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.810
of the game and but this is all it's
 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.270
of the game and but this is all it's
just a bit of fun right but I think

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280
just a bit of fun right but I think
 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.830
just a bit of fun right but I think
what's more what would be bear is right

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840
what's more what would be bear is right
 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.260
what's more what would be bear is right
it's not so much how short the paper is

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:32.270
it's not so much how short the paper is
 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:37.180
it's not so much how short the paper is
but in a way impact per word okay so

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190
but in a way impact per word okay so
 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.350
but in a way impact per word okay so

chief Dalat okay now I this is clearly

00:06:41.679 --> 00:06:41.689
chief Dalat okay now I this is clearly
 

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:43.179
chief Dalat okay now I this is clearly
open to debate but I think that

00:06:43.179 --> 00:06:43.189
open to debate but I think that
 

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:46.420

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.209
candidate for this is this bad boy by
the beautiful Matt John Nash so this is

00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:49.219
the beautiful Matt John Nash so this is
 

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:51.999
the beautiful Matt John Nash so this is
a very very short paper which it starts

00:06:51.999 --> 00:06:52.009
a very very short paper which it starts
 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:55.659
