00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:03.670
You got this.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.713
You got this.

00:00:08.713 --> 00:00:09.711
&gt;&gt; Eden?

00:00:09.711 --> 00:00:10.514
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:00:10.514 --> 00:00:14.190
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm good welcome
let's head out this way.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.840
So today what's going to
happen is we're going to meet.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.912
&gt;&gt; Hey.

00:00:17.912 --> 00:00:20.330
Our IOS candidate is going
to be here pretty soon.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.480
Her portfolio looks really promising.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.960
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm just looking at her resume
now and that Mong app that she built.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.630
That's really intuitive.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.870
So, I'm thinking we tackle it like this.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.275
I'll take the behavioral questions.

00:00:31.275 --> 00:00:33.230
We'll have Kristen do
the Swift questions, and

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.000
then if you could handle
Objective C that would be awesome.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.190
&gt;&gt; Great, yeah, that aught to give
us a good sense of her skills.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.690
It's kind of funny I was looking
at her LinkedIn profile and

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.010
I didn't see anything about Objective C.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.105
I guess we'll find out.

00:00:47.105 --> 00:00:49.400
Okay, here we are.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.180
Now, do you need anything to drink.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.860
Would you like some tea, some coffee?

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.072
&gt;&gt; I'm great, thank you.

00:00:54.072 --> 00:00:56.230
&gt;&gt; Okay, let me know if you
have any other questions.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:02.474
&gt;&gt; Thanks a lot.

00:01:02.474 --> 00:01:04.075
You got this.

00:01:04.075 --> 00:01:05.700
You got this.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.590
As long as they don't
ask about Objective C.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.620
No, you wouldn't do that.
