00:00:12.856 --> 00:00:15.531
I would like to begin
with a little experiment.

00:00:15.555 --> 00:00:18.646
In a moment, I'm going to ask
if you would close your eyes

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.142
and see if you can work out

00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:23.076
what emotions you're feeling right now.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.412
Now, you're not going
to tell anyone or anything.

00:00:25.436 --> 00:00:29.863
The idea is to see how easy
or perhaps hard you find it

00:00:29.887 --> 00:00:32.479
to pinpoint exactly what you're feeling.

00:00:32.503 --> 00:00:35.944
And I thought I'd give you
10 seconds to do this.

00:00:35.968 --> 00:00:37.412
OK?

00:00:37.436 --> 00:00:39.123
Right, let's start.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.527
OK, that's it, time's up.

00:00:49.551 --> 00:00:50.775
How did it go?

00:00:51.113 --> 00:00:53.681
You were probably feeling
a little bit under pressure,

00:00:53.705 --> 00:00:55.871
maybe suspicious
of the person next to you.

00:00:55.895 --> 00:00:58.618
Did they definitely
have their eyes closed?

00:00:58.642 --> 00:01:01.852
Perhaps you felt some
strange, distant worry

00:01:01.876 --> 00:01:04.206
about that email you sent this morning

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.384
or excitement about something
you've got planned for this evening.

00:01:07.408 --> 00:01:10.553
Maybe you felt that exhilaration
that comes when we get together

00:01:10.577 --> 00:01:12.320
in big groups of people like this;

00:01:12.344 --> 00:01:14.512
the Welsh called it "hwyl,"

00:01:14.536 --> 00:01:16.886
from the word for boat sails.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.314
Or maybe you felt all of these things.

00:01:20.338 --> 00:01:23.763
There are some emotions
which wash the world in a single color,

00:01:23.787 --> 00:01:26.796
like the terror felt as a car skids.

00:01:27.344 --> 00:01:29.942
But more often, our emotions
crowd and jostle together

00:01:29.966 --> 00:01:32.803
until it is actually quite hard
to tell them apart.

00:01:33.351 --> 00:01:37.142
Some slide past so quickly
you'd hardly even notice them,

00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:39.594
like the nostalgia
that will make you reach out

00:01:39.618 --> 00:01:42.208
to grab a familiar brand
in the supermarket.

00:01:42.949 --> 00:01:45.351
And then there are others
that we hurry away from,

00:01:45.375 --> 00:01:47.265
fearing that they'll burst on us,

00:01:47.956 --> 00:01:51.955
like the jealousy that causes you
to search a loved one's pockets.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.768
And of course, there are some emotions
which are so peculiar,

00:01:55.792 --> 00:01:57.867
you might not even know what to call them.

00:01:57.891 --> 00:02:00.770
Perhaps sitting there, you had
a little tingle of a desire

00:02:00.794 --> 00:02:05.112
for an emotion one eminent
French sociologist called "ilinx,"

00:02:05.136 --> 00:02:08.662
the delirium that comes
with minor acts of chaos.

00:02:08.686 --> 00:02:12.336
For example, if you stood up right now
and emptied the contents of your bag

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.556
all over the floor.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.507
Perhaps you experienced one of those odd,
untranslatable emotions

00:02:17.531 --> 00:02:20.316
for which there's no obvious
English equivalent.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.625
You might have felt the feeling
the Dutch called "gezelligheid,"

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:27.781
being cozy and warm inside with friends
when it's cold and damp outside.

00:02:28.273 --> 00:02:30.589
Maybe if you were really lucky,

00:02:30.613 --> 00:02:31.807
you felt this:

00:02:32.358 --> 00:02:33.705
"basorexia,"

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:35.766
a sudden urge to kiss someone.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.844
(Laughter)

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.602
We live in an age

00:02:40.626 --> 00:02:44.810
when knowledge of emotions
is an extremely important commodity,

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.552
where emotions are used
to explain many things,

00:02:49.192 --> 00:02:51.109
exploited by our politicians,

00:02:51.133 --> 00:02:53.264
manipulated by algorithms.

00:02:53.288 --> 00:02:58.138
Emotional intelligence, which is the skill
of being able to recognize and name

00:02:58.162 --> 00:03:00.638
your own emotions
and those of other people,

00:03:00.662 --> 00:03:04.849
is considered so important, that this
is taught in our schools and businesses

00:03:04.873 --> 00:03:07.200
and encouraged by our health services.

00:03:07.962 --> 00:03:09.785
But despite all of this,

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:10.988
I sometimes wonder

00:03:11.012 --> 00:03:14.895
if the way we think about emotions
is becoming impoverished.

00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:19.850
Sometimes, we're not even that clear
what an emotion even is.

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:23.455
You've probably heard the theory

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:26.063
that our entire emotional lives
can be boiled down

00:03:26.087 --> 00:03:29.321
to a handful of basic emotions.

00:03:29.345 --> 00:03:31.810
This idea is actually
about 2,000 years old,

00:03:31.834 --> 00:03:32.998
but in our own time,

00:03:33.022 --> 00:03:37.287
some evolutionary psychologists
have suggested that these six emotions --

00:03:37.311 --> 00:03:42.065
happiness, sadness, fear,
disgust, anger, surprise --

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:45.628
are expressed by everyone across the globe
in exactly the same way,

00:03:45.652 --> 00:03:48.335
and therefore represent
the building blocks

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:51.018
of our entire emotional lives.

00:03:51.042 --> 00:03:53.209
Well, if you look at an emotion like this,

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:55.362
then it looks like a simple reflex:

00:03:55.386 --> 00:03:57.622
it's triggered by an external predicament,

00:03:57.646 --> 00:03:59.427
it's hardwired,

00:03:59.451 --> 00:04:02.049
it's there to protect us from harm.

00:04:02.073 --> 00:04:04.537
So you see a bear,
your heart rate quickens,

00:04:04.561 --> 00:04:08.762
your pupils dilate, you feel frightened,
you run very, very fast.

00:04:09.878 --> 00:04:11.965
The problem with this picture is,

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.087
it doesn't entirely capture
what an emotion is.

00:04:16.592 --> 00:04:19.550
Of course, the physiology
is extremely important,

00:04:19.574 --> 00:04:22.725
but it's not the only reason
why we feel the way we do

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:24.324
at any given moment.

00:04:26.102 --> 00:04:29.080
What if I was to tell you
that in the 12th century,

00:04:29.104 --> 00:04:32.856
some troubadours didn't see yawning

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.630
as caused by tiredness
or boredom like we do today,

00:04:36.654 --> 00:04:40.008
but thought it a symbol
of the deepest love?

00:04:40.907 --> 00:04:45.146
Or that in that same period,
brave men -- knights --

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.459
commonly fainted out of dismay?

00:04:49.474 --> 00:04:50.716
What if I was to tell you

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.503
that some early Christians
who lived in the desert

00:04:53.527 --> 00:04:57.415
believed that flying demons
who mainly came out at lunchtime

00:04:57.439 --> 00:05:02.301
could infect them with an emotion
they called "accidie,"

00:05:02.325 --> 00:05:04.919
a kind of lethargy
that was sometimes so intense

00:05:04.943 --> 00:05:06.432
it could even kill them?

00:05:07.234 --> 00:05:11.370
Or that boredom,
as we know and love it today,

00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:14.421
was first really only felt
by the Victorians,

00:05:14.445 --> 00:05:19.621
in response to new ideas
about leisure time and self-improvement?

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.070
What if we were to think again

00:05:22.094 --> 00:05:24.912
about those odd,
untranslatable words for emotions

00:05:24.936 --> 00:05:29.166
and wonder whether some cultures
might feel an emotion more intensely

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.986
just because they've bothered
to name and talk about it,

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.479
like the Russian "toska,"

00:05:35.503 --> 00:05:38.210
a feeling of maddening dissatisfaction

00:05:38.234 --> 00:05:40.768
said to blow in from the great plains.

00:05:43.111 --> 00:05:47.076
The most recent developments
in cognitive science show

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.491
that emotions are not simple reflexes,

00:05:50.515 --> 00:05:53.625
but immensely complex, elastic systems

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:56.797
that respond both to the biologies
that we've inherited

00:05:56.821 --> 00:05:59.470
and to the cultures that we live in now.

00:05:59.494 --> 00:06:01.590
They are cognitive phenomena.

00:06:01.614 --> 00:06:04.563
They're shaped not just by our bodies,
but by our thoughts,

00:06:04.587 --> 00:06:07.416
our concepts, our language.

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:12.409
The neuroscientist Lisa Feldman Barrett
has become very interested

00:06:12.433 --> 00:06:16.177
in this dynamic relationship
between words and emotions.

00:06:16.558 --> 00:06:20.011
She argues that when we learn
a new word for an emotion,

00:06:20.035 --> 00:06:22.933
new feelings are sure to follow.

00:06:24.272 --> 00:06:28.252
As a historian, I've long suspected
that as language changes,

00:06:28.276 --> 00:06:29.959
our emotions do, too.

00:06:30.527 --> 00:06:34.426
When we look to the past, it's easy
to see that emotions have changed,

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.374
sometimes very dramatically,

00:06:36.398 --> 00:06:39.891
in response to new cultural expectations
and religious beliefs,

00:06:39.915 --> 00:06:43.041
new ideas about gender, ethnicity and age,

00:06:43.065 --> 00:06:47.336
even in response to new political
and economic ideologies.

00:06:48.106 --> 00:06:51.504
There is a historicity to emotions

00:06:51.528 --> 00:06:54.940
that we are only recently
starting to understand.

00:06:56.228 --> 00:07:00.399
So I agree absolutely that it does us good
to learn new words for emotions,

00:07:00.423 --> 00:07:02.819
but I think we need to go further.

00:07:02.843 --> 00:07:05.517
I think to be truly
emotionally intelligent,

00:07:05.541 --> 00:07:09.853
we need to understand
where those words have come from,

00:07:09.877 --> 00:07:14.055
and what ideas about how
we ought to live and behave

00:07:14.079 --> 00:07:16.251
they are smuggling along with them.

00:07:17.753 --> 00:07:19.558
Let me tell you a story.

00:07:19.582 --> 00:07:23.712
It begins in a garret
in the late 17th century,

00:07:23.736 --> 00:07:26.262
in the Swiss university town of Basel.

00:07:26.286 --> 00:07:31.951
Inside, there's a dedicated student
living some 60 miles away from home.

00:07:31.975 --> 00:07:33.767
He stops turning up to his lectures,

00:07:33.791 --> 00:07:38.511
and his friends come to visit
and they find him dejected and feverish,

00:07:38.535 --> 00:07:40.401
having heart palpitations,

00:07:40.425 --> 00:07:42.890
strange sores breaking out on his body.

00:07:43.338 --> 00:07:44.502
Doctors are called,

00:07:44.526 --> 00:07:47.405
and they think it's so serious
that prayers are said for him

00:07:47.429 --> 00:07:48.585
in the local church.

00:07:48.609 --> 00:07:51.814
And it's only when they're preparing
to return this young man home

00:07:51.838 --> 00:07:53.030
so that he can die,

00:07:53.054 --> 00:07:54.785
that they realize what's going on,

00:07:54.809 --> 00:07:57.056
because once they lift him
onto the stretcher,

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.777
his breathing becomes less labored.

00:07:58.801 --> 00:08:01.596
And by the time he's got
to the gates of his hometown,

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.744
he's almost entirely recovered.

00:08:04.186 --> 00:08:05.599
And that's when they realize

00:08:05.623 --> 00:08:09.788
that he's been suffering
from a very powerful form of homesickness.

00:08:09.812 --> 00:08:12.285
It's so powerful,
that it might have killed him.

00:08:13.347 --> 00:08:16.615
Well, in 1688, a young doctor,
Johannes Hofer,

00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:18.671
heard of this case and others like it

00:08:18.695 --> 00:08:21.802
and christened the illness "nostalgia."

00:08:22.843 --> 00:08:26.323
The diagnosis quickly caught on
in medical circles around Europe.

00:08:26.347 --> 00:08:28.919
The English actually thought
they were probably immune

00:08:28.943 --> 00:08:31.778
because of all the travel they did
in the empire and so on.

00:08:31.802 --> 00:08:34.350
But soon there were cases
cropping up in Britain, too.

00:08:34.374 --> 00:08:37.242
The last person to die from nostalgia

00:08:37.266 --> 00:08:41.922
was an American soldier fighting
during the First World War in France.

00:08:43.363 --> 00:08:46.932
How is it possible
that you could die from nostalgia

00:08:46.956 --> 00:08:48.768
less than a hundred years ago?

00:08:48.792 --> 00:08:51.864
But today, not only does the word
mean something different --

00:08:51.888 --> 00:08:55.324
a sickening for a lost time
rather than a lost place --

00:08:55.348 --> 00:08:58.646
but homesickness itself
is seen as less serious,

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:01.211
sort of downgraded from something
you could die from

00:09:01.235 --> 00:09:04.484
to something you're mainly worried
your kid might be suffering from

00:09:04.508 --> 00:09:05.676
at a sleepover.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.818
This change seems to have happened
in the early 20th century.

00:09:09.842 --> 00:09:11.061
But why?

00:09:11.085 --> 00:09:15.317
Was it the invention of telephones
or the expansion of the railways?

00:09:15.341 --> 00:09:18.322
Was it perhaps the coming of modernity,

00:09:18.346 --> 00:09:22.075
with its celebration of restlessness
and travel and progress

00:09:22.099 --> 00:09:24.616
that made sickening for the familiar

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.236
seem rather unambitious?

00:09:27.324 --> 00:09:32.342
You and I inherit that massive
transformation in values,

00:09:32.366 --> 00:09:35.623
and it's one reason why we might not
feel homesickness today

00:09:35.647 --> 00:09:37.663
as acutely as we used to.

00:09:39.139 --> 00:09:41.195
It's important to understand

00:09:41.219 --> 00:09:44.755
that these large historical changes
influence our emotions

00:09:44.779 --> 00:09:48.594
partly because they affect
how we feel about how we feel.

00:09:48.991 --> 00:09:51.506
Today, we celebrate happiness.

00:09:51.988 --> 00:09:55.257
Happiness is supposed
to make us better workers

00:09:55.281 --> 00:09:57.448
and parents and partners;

00:09:57.472 --> 00:09:59.948
it's supposed to make us live longer.

00:09:59.972 --> 00:10:01.797
In the 16th century,

00:10:01.821 --> 00:10:04.669
sadness was thought to do
most of those things.

00:10:04.693 --> 00:10:08.091
It's even possible to read
self-help books from that period

00:10:08.115 --> 00:10:10.688
which try to encourage sadness in readers

00:10:10.712 --> 00:10:13.678
by giving them lists of reasons
to be disappointed.

00:10:13.702 --> 00:10:14.744
(Laughter)

00:10:14.768 --> 00:10:19.015
These self-help authors thought
you could cultivate sadness as a skill,

00:10:19.039 --> 00:10:22.197
since being expert in it
would make you more resilient

00:10:22.221 --> 00:10:25.703
when something bad did happen to you,
as invariably it would.

00:10:26.195 --> 00:10:28.631
I think we could learn from this today.

00:10:28.655 --> 00:10:33.826
Feel sad today, and you might feel
impatient, even a little ashamed.

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:37.947
Feel sad in the 16th century,
and you might feel a little bit smug.

00:10:39.391 --> 00:10:42.662
Of course, our emotions
don't just change across time,

00:10:42.686 --> 00:10:44.924
they also change from place to place.

00:10:45.526 --> 00:10:50.105
The Baining people of Papua New Guinea
speak of "awumbuk,"

00:10:50.129 --> 00:10:54.307
a feeling of lethargy that descends
when a houseguest finally leaves.

00:10:54.331 --> 00:10:55.418
(Laughter)

00:10:55.442 --> 00:10:58.031
Now, you or I might feel relief,

00:10:58.055 --> 00:11:00.172
but in Baining culture,

00:11:00.196 --> 00:11:03.273
departing guests are thought
to shed a sort of heaviness

00:11:03.297 --> 00:11:05.051
so they can travel more easily,

00:11:05.075 --> 00:11:08.203
and this heaviness infects the air
and causes this awumbuk.

00:11:08.227 --> 00:11:11.048
And so what they do is leave
a bowl of water out overnight

00:11:11.072 --> 00:11:12.248
to absorb this air,

00:11:12.272 --> 00:11:15.648
and then very early the next morning,
they wake up and have a ceremony

00:11:15.672 --> 00:11:16.896
and throw the water away.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.183
Now, here's a good example

00:11:18.207 --> 00:11:22.244
of spiritual practices
and geographical realities combining

00:11:22.268 --> 00:11:24.722
to bring a distinct emotion into life

00:11:24.746 --> 00:11:26.506
and make it disappear again.

00:11:27.836 --> 00:11:32.469
One of my favorite emotions
is a Japanese word, "amae."

00:11:33.425 --> 00:11:35.757
Amae is a very common word in Japan,

00:11:35.781 --> 00:11:37.809
but it is actually quite
hard to translate.

00:11:37.833 --> 00:11:40.372
It means something like
the pleasure that you get

00:11:40.396 --> 00:11:44.390
when you're able to temporarily
hand over responsibility for your life

00:11:44.414 --> 00:11:45.718
to someone else.

00:11:45.742 --> 00:11:46.752
(Laughter)

00:11:46.776 --> 00:11:48.443
Now, anthropologists suggest

00:11:48.467 --> 00:11:52.495
that one reason why this word
might have been named and celebrated

00:11:52.519 --> 00:11:53.707
in Japan

00:11:53.731 --> 00:11:57.665
is because of that country's
traditionally collectivist culture,

00:11:57.689 --> 00:12:00.755
whereas the feeling of dependency

00:12:00.779 --> 00:12:03.639
may be more fraught
amongst English speakers,

00:12:03.663 --> 00:12:07.922
who have learned to value
self-sufficiency and individualism.

00:12:09.152 --> 00:12:11.539
This might be a little simplistic,

00:12:11.563 --> 00:12:13.317
but it is tantalizing.

00:12:13.889 --> 00:12:19.263
What might our emotional languages
tell us not just about what we feel,

00:12:19.287 --> 00:12:22.194
but about what we value most?

00:12:24.877 --> 00:12:28.981
Most people who tell us
to pay attention to our well-being

00:12:29.005 --> 00:12:32.714
talk of the importance
of naming our emotions.

00:12:32.738 --> 00:12:35.971
But these names aren't neutral labels.

00:12:35.995 --> 00:12:39.220
They are freighted with our culture's
values and expectations,

00:12:39.244 --> 00:12:42.570
and they transmit ideas
about who we think we are.

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:47.722
Learning new and unusual words
for emotions will help attune us

00:12:47.746 --> 00:12:51.233
to the more finely grained
aspects of our inner lives.

00:12:51.802 --> 00:12:55.508
But more than this, I think these
words are worth caring about,

00:12:55.532 --> 00:12:58.875
because they remind us
how powerful the connection is

00:12:58.899 --> 00:13:00.391
between what we think

00:13:00.415 --> 00:13:02.241
and how we end up feeling.

00:13:03.156 --> 00:13:07.171
True emotional intelligence
requires that we understand

00:13:07.195 --> 00:13:11.999
the social, the political,
the cultural forces

00:13:12.023 --> 00:13:15.556
that have shaped what we've come
to believe about our emotions

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:21.698
and understand how happiness
or hatred or love or anger

00:13:21.722 --> 00:13:24.209
might still be changing now.

00:13:24.698 --> 00:13:27.586
Because if we want to measure our emotions

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:29.553
and teach them in our schools

00:13:29.577 --> 00:13:33.186
and listen as our politicians
tell us how important they are,

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:35.410
then it is a good idea that we understand

00:13:35.434 --> 00:13:37.390
where the assumptions we have about them

00:13:37.414 --> 00:13:38.594
have come from,

00:13:38.618 --> 00:13:41.922
and whether they still
truly speak to us now.

00:13:43.478 --> 00:13:45.558
I want to end with an emotion I often feel

00:13:45.582 --> 00:13:47.566
when I'm working as a historian.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:50.051
It's a French word, "dépaysement."

00:13:50.495 --> 00:13:55.304
It evokes the giddy disorientation
that you feel in an unfamiliar place.

00:13:55.328 --> 00:13:57.424
One of my favorite parts
of being a historian

00:13:57.448 --> 00:13:59.932
is when something
I've completely taken for granted,

00:13:59.956 --> 00:14:02.527
some very familiar part of my life,

00:14:02.551 --> 00:14:04.635
is suddenly made strange again.

00:14:05.262 --> 00:14:08.079
Dépaysement is unsettling,

00:14:08.103 --> 00:14:09.958
but it's exciting, too.

00:14:09.982 --> 00:14:13.516
And I hope you might be having
just a little glimpse of it right now.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:14.707
Thank you.

00:14:14.731 --> 00:14:17.532
(Applause)
