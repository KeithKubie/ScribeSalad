00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.120
Gentlemen, have you ever seen a cocky guy
at a bar and thought, “Man I can’t stand

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.740
that guy, why do women like him?”

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:16.630
They don’t, but you’re not giving them
another option by sitting over there and moping.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.160
Hello guys and of course, ladies, this episode
is for you too.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.620
Julian here for DNews.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.230
A new study from the University of Queensland
offers a new answer for why overconfident

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.140
men at bars and clubs seem to be more successful.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.760
The study had over 3000 men and women create
dating profiles which were rated by the opposite

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.760
sex.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.390
Subjects researchers identified as confident
came across as either confident, which was

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.690
appealing, or arrogant, which wasn’t.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.940
Nobody likes that guy, c’mon.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.890
And the women in the study agreed.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.969
That is until the men had the option to compete
with each other.

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.739
Cocky guys were more willing to go toe to
toe with the competition, and usually weren’t

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:53.890
the first to blink.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.250
Because they didn’t back down, they eliminated
the competition, and it’s easy to come in

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.690
first when you’re in a race of one.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.249
The same held true for women; when they could
compete with each other, the more confident

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:05.860
ones drove others away and were more successful.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.460
The researchers suggested the same arrogance
would translate to a crowded bar or club,

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.690
and the arrogant ones would usually come out
on top.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.330
Get your mind out of the gutter.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.470
This adds some food for thought to the age
old cliche that confidence is sexy.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.710
And it is.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.000
As Andrea Bartz explains in her advice column
on the Date Report, one of the many reasons

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.850
confidence is sexy is because confident people
are naturally good at selling themselves.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.640
Not literally… well, I guess so too, I wouldn’t
know.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.200
But when given the opportunity to present
just how great they are, confident people

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.520
took it and ran.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.060
That confidence is more likely to help your
cause.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.390
Confident people also make it clear they’re
interested in us.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.340
According to Harvard Psychologist Dr. Craig
Malkin, when someone expresses interest in

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.730
us, we have a natural tendency to reciprocate.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.860
But arrogance pushes people away and is generally
unattractive.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.030
And like I said, it cuts both ways for men
and women.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.860
Researchers at Webster University observed
women flirting in a bar.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.230
Consistently the most successful approach
was a smile and eye contact, regardless of

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.470
what the woman looked like.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.860
Another group of researchers asked some participants
to treat a shy girl like she was the hottest

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.200
thing since bacon, and over the course of
the semester she became much more confident.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.480
By the end, students who weren’t a part
of the study were asking her out.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.140
So when you fold in the new info from the
University of Queensland, It looks like there’s

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.970
an ideal balance of being confident just barely
to the point of arrogance.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.340
Be confident to be attractive, and just over
the top enough to drive the competition away.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.380
Of course no matter how confident and gorgeous
you are, you’re not going to be everyone’s

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.380
cup of tea.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.310
Know when to take a hint and find someone
else to charm.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.680
If you’re ready to get out there but you
still have no idea what you’re doing, Tara’s

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:56.510
got a brief guide on how to flirt better using

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:03.180
science here.
