00:00:23.476 --> 00:00:25.739
- For me it's an honor

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:27.869
that she would write about my father,

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.619
and particularly on a
very difficult subject.

00:00:37.945 --> 00:00:39.896
- It was such a great opportunity

00:00:39.896 --> 00:00:42.740
to get to learn about Howard Baker.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.302
That was, I think, the most rewarding part

00:00:45.302 --> 00:00:46.747
of the experience.

00:00:46.747 --> 00:00:49.950
His civility, his
willingness to compromise,

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.612
and his genuine attempt to
bring everyone together,

00:00:53.612 --> 00:00:57.357
these are traits that can
apply to my life as well.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.815
- It's an honor that you would choose him

00:01:10.815 --> 00:01:13.462
and that subject to write about.
