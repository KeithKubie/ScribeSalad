00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:02.702 align:start size:97% position:3%
the third in the four species
of sharks that I wanna

00:00:02.702 --> 00:00:06.639 align:start size:97% position:3%
share with you tonight is
the Oceanic White Tip shark,

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:10.643 line:0%
a shark that has been listed
as the fourth most dangerous

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:13.879 line:0%
species of sharks if you
pay attention to such lists.

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:17.283
It's an animal that is
a true pelagic predator.

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:20.420
This animal lives way
out in the open ocean,

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.654
hunts in deep water,

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:23.223 align:start size:81% position:19%
occasionally rises
to the surface,

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.758 align:start size:84% position:16%
it's been called the
ship wreck shark,

00:00:25.758 --> 00:00:28.828
because there are sort of
infamous stories about them

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:31.197 align:start size:84% position:16%
taking out sailors
that were ship wrecked

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:32.732
that are drifting at sea.

00:00:32.732 --> 00:00:36.202
But this is an animal that
has to be very efficient

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:37.470
at hunting.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.772
The open ocean has been
described as the desert

00:00:39.772 --> 00:00:43.142
and there's only pockets
of life here and there

00:00:43.142 --> 00:00:46.679 align:start position:0%
so these animals have to be
very very good at what they do.

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:49.482
Oceanics tend to be
generally in size

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:51.984
between nine and
12 feet in length.

00:00:51.984 --> 00:00:55.855 align:start size:97% position:3%
And they have those
beautiful long pectoral fins,

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:58.258
not unlike the Thresher or
the Blue shark that we saw

00:00:58.258 --> 00:00:59.425
but even longer.

00:00:59.425 --> 00:01:01.527 align:start size:84% position:16%
Their scientific
name, their Latin name

00:01:01.527 --> 00:01:03.629
is longimanus which
when translated means

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.465
the long hand or
the long fingers,

00:01:06.465 --> 00:01:08.701
which is an apt description.

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:11.537
You can imagine an
animal like this,

00:01:11.537 --> 00:01:13.105
swimming up toward the surface

00:01:13.105 --> 00:01:15.041
and then just gliding down.

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:17.943
Maybe a mile deep
into the ocean,

00:01:17.943 --> 00:01:19.478
looking for prey.

00:01:19.478 --> 00:01:22.815 align:start size:88% position:13%
Completely effortlessly
with its pectorals,

00:01:22.815 --> 00:01:25.084
those dermal denticles,
completely hydrodynamic

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:29.455
just swooping in silently and
nailing some deep water fish.

00:01:29.455 --> 00:01:31.557 align:start size:97% position:3%
Very efficient predator
and this one as you can see

00:01:31.557 --> 00:01:33.459
is kinda, find it
beefy, kind of fat

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:35.461 align:start size:84% position:16%
so there's no
problem getting food.

00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:38.164
This is an image I made that
shows that distinct shape,

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:39.832
the silhouette shape.

00:01:39.832 --> 00:01:42.969
This was in a place called
Cat Island in the Bahamas.

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:46.873 align:start size:97% position:3%
And it was back in 2006 that
I did an expedition there

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:49.308 align:start size:97% position:3%
as part of a story I was
doing for National Geographic

00:01:49.308 --> 00:01:52.178 align:start size:84% position:16%
because we had heard
some fish tales

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:54.013
about oceanic white tips

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:54.980
being seen there.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.515
Now oceanics hadn't been seen.

00:01:56.515 --> 00:01:59.252
I didn't know any diver that
had seen one in 20 or 30 years

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:00.753
in the Bahamas.

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:02.255
But these sport fishermen
said they were catching

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:04.156
yellow fin tuna and as they
were reeling in the tuna,

00:02:04.156 --> 00:02:06.326
they said that oceanics
were stealing the fish

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:08.360
off their line.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.030 align:start size:88% position:13%
So on that gamble I went
out there for 16 days

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.000
and in 16 days only found one.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.234
But I brought a cage along

00:02:15.234 --> 00:02:16.602 align:start size:84% position:16%
because we didn't know
what we would find,

00:02:16.602 --> 00:02:19.105 align:start position:0%
this is Wes Pratt a sharkâ– 
biologist inside.

00:02:19.105 --> 00:02:21.040
Turns out we were there
at the wrong time of year

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.810 align:start size:97% position:3%
but if you go at different
times of year you can see more

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.311
oceanic white tips.

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:29.515
But oceanic white tips,
as recently as about 1970

00:02:29.515 --> 00:02:33.052 align:start size:97% position:3%
or in the early 70s were
described as the most abundant

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:35.287
large animal on the planet.

00:02:35.287 --> 00:02:37.090
Most abundant large
animal, large meaning

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.591 align:start size:84% position:16%
anything bigger than
a hundred pounds.

00:02:38.591 --> 00:02:40.426
So think about that,
there must have been

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:41.760
zillions of em out there.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.830
Today they're 99% in decline.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.832 align:start size:84% position:16%
They're on the
verge of extinction.

00:02:46.832 --> 00:02:48.568
Largely because of their fins.

00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:51.237 align:start size:94% position:6%
Their fins are highly
priced in shark fin soup.

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:54.240 align:start size:94% position:6%
Cat Island in the
Bahamas is one of the only

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.709
remaining pockets of
oceanic white tips

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:57.910
that's left on the planet.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.211
You can find them in Hawaii,

00:02:59.211 --> 00:03:00.680
a little bit, sporadically.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.181
You can find them
in the red sea,

00:03:02.181 --> 00:03:04.250
but this is really one of
the only concentrations.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.485
This is my friend Jerome
Arrow, a shark camera man

00:03:06.485 --> 00:03:07.987
swimming with one of them here.

00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:09.555 align:start size:88% position:13%
So it's one of the only
places you could go

00:03:09.555 --> 00:03:11.357
to photograph them
and for this story,

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:12.658
it's where I spent my time.

00:03:12.658 --> 00:03:13.793
We have two of em
here, it's like one

00:03:13.793 --> 00:03:15.294
is saying to the other one,

00:03:15.294 --> 00:03:16.929
don't look now but there's
a guy taking our picture

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:18.597
over there.

00:03:18.597 --> 00:03:22.134
But, it's all done
with free diving,

00:03:22.134 --> 00:03:23.769
we're not using scuba with this,

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.238
we're just snorkeling.

00:03:25.238 --> 00:03:26.872 align:start size:84% position:16%
Mask, snorkel,
and fins and a wet suit.

00:03:26.872 --> 00:03:29.842 align:start position:0%
And it can get a little
interesting when there's several

00:03:29.842 --> 00:03:32.044
of em around, there's three
in this particular frame,

00:03:32.044 --> 00:03:33.479 align:start size:88% position:13%
especially when the
ocean is a little rough,

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:35.447
they'll come in and
oceanic white tips,

00:03:35.447 --> 00:03:36.849 align:start size:84% position:16%
as Gimbel mentioned,
will often bump.

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.753
I've never seen their teeth
but unlike some of the other

00:03:40.753 --> 00:03:42.989 align:start size:94% position:6%
species that are a little
bit more standoffish,

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.424
they are quite curious and
they will come in and bump.

00:03:45.424 --> 00:03:48.027
And when they do that
nictitating membrane,

00:03:48.027 --> 00:03:50.063
that white membrane
goes over their eye

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:50.996
to protect them.

00:03:50.996 --> 00:03:52.498
So if they were attacking prey

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:54.099
that might scratch their
eye, it's an evolutionary

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:55.868
thing that they've developed.

00:03:55.868 --> 00:03:58.037
But beautiful animals.

00:03:58.037 --> 00:03:59.839
And on one of my
last days there,

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:01.273
I photographed this pair.

00:04:01.273 --> 00:04:02.941 align:start size:84% position:16%
And the one in the
foreground as you see,

00:04:02.941 --> 00:04:06.246
has a satellite tag on
it near the dorsal fin.

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:09.414
And these are researchers
that have begun to tag

00:04:09.414 --> 00:04:10.916
these animals and try to
track their movements,

00:04:10.916 --> 00:04:12.451
they don't stay at Cat Island.

00:04:12.451 --> 00:04:14.286
And we're not quite sure I
think where they're going

00:04:14.286 --> 00:04:16.455
so, we need to know
that information

00:04:16.455 --> 00:04:17.656 align:start size:84% position:16%
if we're gonna be
able to protect them.

00:04:17.656 --> 00:04:19.559
Bahamas has protected all sharks

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:22.094
which is a very good and
progressive thing to do

00:04:22.094 --> 00:04:24.096 align:start size:88% position:13%
but if they go somewhere
else and get killed,

00:04:24.096 --> 00:04:25.564
that wouldn't be good so,

00:04:25.564 --> 00:04:27.833 align:start size:97% position:3%
it's gonna be helpful to have
that sort of information.

00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:30.002
So I have another little
video of what it's like

00:04:30.002 --> 00:04:31.237 align:start size:84% position:16%
diving at Cat
Island with me here,

00:04:31.237 --> 00:04:33.472
oops, maybe we don't.

00:04:33.472 --> 00:04:35.274
Alright, well we'll just go
right to Great White Sharks,

00:04:35.274 --> 00:04:36.709
how's that?

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:40.980 align:start size:97% position:3%
So the last species off
course is Great White Sharks.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.116 align:start size:84% position:16%
That I wanted to
share with you tonight

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:47.453 align:start size:94% position:6%
and as you may know, Great
Whites are the largest

00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:49.988
predatory fish on earth.

00:04:49.988 --> 00:04:52.592
An absolute ultimate predator.

00:04:52.592 --> 00:04:55.495
This is an animal that
can weigh well over a ton

00:04:55.495 --> 00:04:59.666
and has more than 300 big
serrated teeth in its mouth

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.569 align:start size:97% position:3%
and it can grow to
lengths of at least 20 feet,

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:06.204
some anecdotal reports
of bigger ones out there

00:05:06.204 --> 00:05:07.940
but we know at least 20 feet.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.310
But it's an animal that
is largely enigmatic.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.712
We know very little
about great whites.

00:05:13.712 --> 00:05:16.548
We don't know how
many there are,

00:05:16.548 --> 00:05:19.151
or very much about
them in the places

00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:21.320
that we even get to
see brief glimpses.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.390
Now you can imagine a
terrestrial predator

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.525 align:start size:84% position:16%
the size of a
pickup truck hunting

00:05:26.525 --> 00:05:28.727
along the coast of California.

00:05:28.727 --> 00:05:30.529 align:start size:97% position:3%
you know, we would know
everything there is to know

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:31.730
about that animal.

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.266 align:start size:84% position:16%
But in the sea,
that's not the case.

00:05:34.266 --> 00:05:36.101
We don't get that
kind of access.

00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:38.905
So they do remain
largely enigmatic

00:05:38.905 --> 00:05:40.573
and very mysterious.

00:05:41.974 --> 00:05:46.379
For this story in the July
Issue of National Geographic,

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:48.314
I worked in two locations.

00:05:48.314 --> 00:05:50.415
The first of which
was South Australia.

00:05:50.415 --> 00:05:52.584
And I went to Australia
because it was a place

00:05:52.584 --> 00:05:54.753
where I thought I had
a pretty good chance

00:05:54.753 --> 00:05:55.954
of seeing sharks.

00:05:55.954 --> 00:05:58.090
The first job in
doing these stories

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.725 align:start size:88% position:13%
is to be able to see the
thing you want to try

00:05:59.725 --> 00:06:01.494 align:start size:84% position:16%
to photograph and
sometimes underwater,

00:06:01.494 --> 00:06:02.995
that's not always so easy.

00:06:02.995 --> 00:06:05.531
But it was also a location
where Great White Sharks

00:06:05.531 --> 00:06:09.268 align:start size:97% position:3%
have been observed and
studied for a very long time.

00:06:09.268 --> 00:06:13.138 align:start size:97% position:3%
And there are some new
theories emerging about them.

00:06:13.138 --> 00:06:14.807
There's various hubs.

00:06:14.807 --> 00:06:17.576
It was always believed that
Great Whites were loners,

00:06:17.576 --> 00:06:19.946 align:start size:88% position:13%
that they pretty much
wandered the ocean alone

00:06:19.946 --> 00:06:22.714
by themselves but we know
now that there is some

00:06:22.714 --> 00:06:24.550 align:start size:84% position:16%
social behavior,
there are these hubs

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.219
where they tend to
congregate often

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:28.720
for feeding or mating.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.791
But not much is really known
about those social behaviors.

00:06:32.791 --> 00:06:35.427 align:start size:84% position:16%
This is a photo
that I made at dusk,

00:06:35.427 --> 00:06:38.163 align:start size:88% position:13%
when we see two great
whites sort of moving in

00:06:38.163 --> 00:06:40.833
in this hunting behavior,
they often get very frisky

00:06:40.833 --> 00:06:42.768
at sunset time.

00:06:42.768 --> 00:06:46.638 align:start size:88% position:13%
But besides things
that, complex behaviors

00:06:46.638 --> 00:06:48.507
like social behaviors as I said,

00:06:48.507 --> 00:06:51.844
we really don't know very
much about anything else

00:06:51.844 --> 00:06:53.345
with these animals.

00:06:53.345 --> 00:06:55.948
We see some patterns in
their migratory behavior,

00:06:55.948 --> 00:06:58.884
some seem to follow certain
little highways in the ocean,

00:06:58.884 --> 00:07:00.552
but others are very random.

00:07:00.552 --> 00:07:04.390 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's not really understood and
we've never seen them mate,

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:07.292 align:start size:97% position:3%
we don't know where great
whites are having their pups,

00:07:07.292 --> 00:07:08.694
there their nursery grounds are.

00:07:08.694 --> 00:07:09.928
Again there's some theories.

00:07:09.928 --> 00:07:12.131
There's one off in New
York that was described

00:07:12.131 --> 00:07:14.766
this year but a lot more
has to be done on that.

00:07:14.766 --> 00:07:16.401
And as I mentioned earlier too,

00:07:16.401 --> 00:07:18.471 align:start size:97% position:3%
we don't even know how many
there are in the world.

00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:20.706 align:start size:94% position:6%
We can't decide if
they're endangered or not.

00:07:20.706 --> 00:07:22.507
Most scientists would
think that they are

00:07:22.507 --> 00:07:25.010
but there are those who think
the population's increasing

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:26.712
while others think
they're declining.

00:07:26.712 --> 00:07:29.014 align:start size:94% position:6%
Until recently, it was
believed that great whites

00:07:29.014 --> 00:07:31.350 align:start size:81% position:19%
only live to
about 35 years old

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.185 align:start size:81% position:19%
but a new paper
came out last year

00:07:33.185 --> 00:07:35.654
that said that they live
well into their seventies.

00:07:35.654 --> 00:07:40.025
So imagine this predator that's
wandering thousands of miles

00:07:40.025 --> 00:07:43.362 align:start position:0%
in the course of a year and
living well into its seventies.

00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:44.663
You know what kind of wisdom

00:07:44.663 --> 00:07:46.766 align:start size:81% position:19%
might an animal
like that possess.

00:07:46.766 --> 00:07:48.567
I don't know that we'll
ever tap into that but,

00:07:48.567 --> 00:07:50.670 align:start size:81% position:19%
it's certainly fun
to think about.

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.271 align:start size:94% position:6%
For me, photographically,
Australia was a place

00:07:53.271 --> 00:07:56.541 align:start size:97% position:3%
where I could get close and
make pictures of these animals

00:07:56.541 --> 00:07:59.278 align:start size:84% position:16%
and try to show that
grace and power.

00:07:59.278 --> 00:08:02.614 align:start position:0%
It's nothing like a great
white, it just exudes confidence

00:08:02.614 --> 00:08:06.451 align:start size:97% position:3%
and to the degree that I could
show it through photography

00:08:06.451 --> 00:08:07.820
their personality.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.289
I think all animals
have personalities

00:08:10.289 --> 00:08:11.958
and sharks certainly do.

00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.694 align:start size:97% position:3%
Tigers have a different
personality than great whites,

00:08:14.694 --> 00:08:17.162 align:start size:88% position:13%
but even within a single
species, you know,

00:08:17.162 --> 00:08:18.630
some sharks are a
little more bold,

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:21.934
others are shy, this was
an animal that had a broken

00:08:21.934 --> 00:08:24.503 align:start size:97% position:3%
dorsal fin and her
personality was pretty mean.

00:08:24.503 --> 00:08:26.304
She was not very happy,
I think she didn't like

00:08:26.304 --> 00:08:28.374
having that broken dorsal there.

00:08:28.374 --> 00:08:31.944 align:start size:97% position:3%
But it was also, South
Australia was the only place

00:08:31.944 --> 00:08:33.979
in the world that I knew of

00:08:33.979 --> 00:08:36.181
where I could make
bottom pictures.

00:08:36.181 --> 00:08:38.584
Most of the white shark
photos we see are up

00:08:38.584 --> 00:08:40.186
in the water column
in the blue water.

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:42.521
But this was a place
where the operator

00:08:42.521 --> 00:08:44.056
I was working with
had a bottom cage

00:08:44.056 --> 00:08:47.593 align:start size:88% position:13%
and we could send it
down 60 to 80 feet or so

00:08:47.593 --> 00:08:49.662
and have a chance of
seeing sharks over

00:08:49.662 --> 00:08:50.896
the benthic region.

00:08:50.896 --> 00:08:52.331
Now it was a tricky thing to do

00:08:52.331 --> 00:08:54.533
because the cage
was always moving.

00:08:54.533 --> 00:08:57.003
As the boat moved, the cage
was bouncing along the bottom

00:08:57.003 --> 00:09:00.406
so, and there was also this
big wall of silver jacks,

00:09:00.406 --> 00:09:03.041
these fish that would just,
like a curtain of mirrors

00:09:03.041 --> 00:09:03.975
all around.

00:09:03.975 --> 00:09:05.444
So in order to make this photo,

00:09:05.444 --> 00:09:07.313
which I hadn't really
seen anything like this before,

00:09:07.313 --> 00:09:09.582
I had to open the
door of the cage

00:09:09.582 --> 00:09:11.817
and sort of lean out and
punch through that wall

00:09:11.817 --> 00:09:14.920
of fish, scatter the fish,
and then for a few seconds

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.389 align:start size:97% position:3%
I saw this white shark
swimming through this forest,

00:09:17.389 --> 00:09:19.158
coming towards this ray.

00:09:19.158 --> 00:09:20.759
They do predate on rays,

00:09:20.759 --> 00:09:21.960
this one didn't get eaten,

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.029
but they're also
there to eat seals,

00:09:24.029 --> 00:09:27.099
but a different view that
might engage the reader

00:09:27.099 --> 00:09:28.200 align:start size:81% position:19%
of the magazine
to wanna know more

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.803
about these amazing creatures.

00:09:30.803 --> 00:09:34.239
I also worked in surface
cages out there as well.

00:09:34.239 --> 00:09:35.574
I didn't ever get
out of the cage

00:09:35.574 --> 00:09:37.342 align:start size:84% position:16%
because there's always
a lot of sharks.

00:09:37.342 --> 00:09:40.145
There was usually at least
three or four of em around

00:09:40.145 --> 00:09:42.247
and they were checking you out.

00:09:42.247 --> 00:09:43.515
I mean they would come right in.

00:09:43.515 --> 00:09:45.918
This was one on sort
of a rainy rough day

00:09:45.918 --> 00:09:47.152
at the surface.

00:09:47.152 --> 00:09:48.287
And the operator
I was working with

00:09:48.287 --> 00:09:50.022
had a single person cage

00:09:50.022 --> 00:09:51.824
that he didn't usually use

00:09:51.824 --> 00:09:53.092
but he let me use it,

00:09:53.092 --> 00:09:54.627
the reason he doesn't
let most people use it

00:09:54.627 --> 00:09:57.662 align:start size:88% position:13%
is because it has these
big openings in it

00:09:57.662 --> 00:09:59.164
and sometimes the white sharks

00:09:59.164 --> 00:10:00.365
can get a little curious

00:10:00.365 --> 00:10:02.067 align:start size:84% position:16%
and they'll start
poking their nose in.

00:10:02.067 --> 00:10:03.969
Now usually when
they get curious,

00:10:03.969 --> 00:10:07.506
you just poke em with
your camera housing

00:10:07.506 --> 00:10:09.208
and they get deterred
and they swim away

00:10:09.208 --> 00:10:12.611
but, I had one day when
about a 14 foot male

00:10:12.611 --> 00:10:15.547
was a little over anxious
and sort of just started

00:10:15.547 --> 00:10:18.684 align:start size:84% position:16%
coming in and he ended
up getting caught

00:10:18.684 --> 00:10:21.520 align:start size:84% position:16%
between my strobe
cord and my strobe arm

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.789 align:start size:88% position:13%
and he ended up
ripping the strobe cord

00:10:23.789 --> 00:10:25.457
off the camera housing,

00:10:25.457 --> 00:10:26.725
I almost lost the entire rig,

00:10:26.725 --> 00:10:28.828
it's about a 30, 25
thousand dollar rig.

00:10:28.828 --> 00:10:31.463 align:start size:97% position:3%
I ended up just loosing a
three thousand dollar strobe

00:10:31.463 --> 00:10:34.734
but, Trevor Frost, who's
in the audience tonight

00:10:34.734 --> 00:10:37.369
was assisting me there and
he had a GoPro in the water.

00:10:37.369 --> 00:10:39.004
So I'm gonna show a little clip

00:10:39.004 --> 00:10:41.306
that shows me try to
wrestle this shark

00:10:41.306 --> 00:10:43.441
to get my camera back.

00:10:43.441 --> 00:10:45.077
At the end I didn't have fins on

00:10:45.077 --> 00:10:46.579
so I walking up the
side of the cage.

00:10:46.579 --> 00:10:49.715 align:start size:97% position:3%
Can't see it that great but,
anyway we'll have a look.

00:10:49.715 --> 00:10:52.118
(soft music)

00:11:29.821 --> 00:11:32.825 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Oh well, I'm
pretty sure I got it.

00:11:33.692 --> 00:11:34.926
- Yeah.

00:11:34.926 --> 00:11:37.429
So I lost the strobe
but I kept the camera

00:11:37.429 --> 00:11:38.563
so that was the good news.

00:11:38.563 --> 00:11:41.100 align:start size:88% position:13%
Well the other location
for this story,

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.635 align:start size:84% position:16%
the last location
for the evening here

00:11:43.635 --> 00:11:46.972 align:start size:94% position:6%
is Cape Cod Massachusetts
my home waters

00:11:46.972 --> 00:11:50.409 align:start size:84% position:16%
where I live and
where I started out.

00:11:50.409 --> 00:11:53.645
What's happening in Cape Cod
is actually unique I think

00:11:53.645 --> 00:11:54.913
in the animal kingdom.

00:11:54.913 --> 00:11:57.349
What we have is a
newly emerging hub

00:11:57.349 --> 00:11:58.817
for White shark activity.

00:11:58.817 --> 00:12:02.521 align:start size:97% position:3%
There's about five known
hubs of white shark activity

00:12:02.521 --> 00:12:03.455
in the world.

00:12:03.455 --> 00:12:06.158
But Cape Cod is the newest one.

00:12:06.158 --> 00:12:10.796 align:start size:97% position:3%
And it's only started
happening since about 2009,

00:12:10.796 --> 00:12:13.298
when the white sharks
have re-emerged here.

00:12:13.298 --> 00:12:15.334
And this would be analogous

00:12:15.334 --> 00:12:19.838 align:start size:94% position:6%
to a new pride of lions
emerging in the Serengeti.

00:12:19.838 --> 00:12:23.274 align:start size:97% position:3%
And I'm not aware of any
other new group of predators

00:12:23.274 --> 00:12:25.210 align:start size:84% position:16%
just sort of taking
up residency somewhere

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:27.746 align:start size:84% position:16%
but that's what's
happening in Cape Cod.

00:12:27.746 --> 00:12:31.249
It seems as though there's
some anthropological evidence

00:12:31.249 --> 00:12:33.718
that seems to indicate
that there was a robust

00:12:33.718 --> 00:12:35.854
seal population in Massachusetts

00:12:35.854 --> 00:12:38.323
back in the 1600s around
the time that the pilgrims

00:12:38.323 --> 00:12:41.293 align:start size:88% position:13%
came there but they were
wiped out by sealers.

00:12:41.293 --> 00:12:44.396 align:start size:84% position:16%
So they were gone
for hundreds of years

00:12:44.396 --> 00:12:47.399 align:start size:97% position:3%
but in 1972, with the marine
mammal protection act,

00:12:47.399 --> 00:12:50.335
they were protected and these
seals have slowly come back

00:12:50.335 --> 00:12:53.471
and overtime the sharks
have come back as well.

00:12:53.471 --> 00:12:56.375 align:start size:97% position:3%
Chatham is sort of the
epicenter of all this activity

00:12:56.375 --> 00:12:57.843
in the middle of Cape Cod

00:12:57.843 --> 00:13:01.180 align:start size:94% position:6%
and they have sort of
embraced their sharkiness.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:04.149 align:start position:0%
All kinds of little nick knacks
and sharky stuff for sale

00:13:04.149 --> 00:13:05.718
in many of the gift shops,

00:13:05.718 --> 00:13:08.954 align:start size:81% position:19%
at least until
something happens.

00:13:08.954 --> 00:13:11.756
But yeah so this
is where I worked.

00:13:11.756 --> 00:13:13.458
I spent two seasons out there

00:13:13.458 --> 00:13:16.628 align:start size:84% position:16%
trying to tell this
emerging story.

00:13:16.628 --> 00:13:18.463
Very difficult place to work.

00:13:18.463 --> 00:13:20.432
But this is why the
sharks are there

00:13:20.432 --> 00:13:23.502 align:start size:94% position:6%
as I mentioned the growing
number of grey seals.

00:13:23.502 --> 00:13:26.005 align:start size:94% position:6%
This is what's for
dinner, at least if you're

00:13:26.005 --> 00:13:28.440 align:start size:94% position:6%
a great white shark, they
seem to be singularly

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.708
focused on seals.

00:13:29.708 --> 00:13:31.476
They're not feeding on
fish or anything else,

00:13:31.476 --> 00:13:34.446
they just come here
to feed on the seals.

00:13:34.446 --> 00:13:35.713 align:start size:84% position:16%
And this is an
aerial photo I made

00:13:35.713 --> 00:13:37.316
of one of these great whites.

00:13:37.316 --> 00:13:38.950 align:start size:88% position:13%
You can see in the
lower right of the frame

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:40.519 align:start size:84% position:16%
and all those seals,
they're hunting

00:13:40.519 --> 00:13:42.254
in very very shallow water.

00:13:42.254 --> 00:13:44.656 align:start size:84% position:16%
Most of the
literature that exist,

00:13:44.656 --> 00:13:47.226
all of the literature
that exist says that

00:13:47.226 --> 00:13:50.795
for a great white shark to
hunt a pinniped, a seal,

00:13:50.795 --> 00:13:53.331
it needs about 80 feet
of water to ambush them.

00:13:53.331 --> 00:13:56.167 align:start size:84% position:16%
But we've been
documenting predation

00:13:56.167 --> 00:13:59.070
in as shallow as five
or 10 feet of water.

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:00.806
So this is a unique strategy,

00:14:00.806 --> 00:14:02.073
unique in the world.

00:14:02.073 --> 00:14:04.443 align:start size:88% position:13%
Not all of their
attacks are successful.

00:14:04.443 --> 00:14:07.146 align:start size:84% position:16%
This was a grey seal
that was attacked

00:14:07.146 --> 00:14:08.447
and got away,

00:14:08.447 --> 00:14:11.149 align:start size:84% position:16%
but it did actually
die later so,

00:14:11.149 --> 00:14:13.918 align:start position:0%
they're not always, I don't
know what their success rate is,

00:14:13.918 --> 00:14:17.823
it hasn't been measured, but
that's what's going on there.

00:14:17.823 --> 00:14:20.092
In the years since 2009,

00:14:20.092 --> 00:14:22.594 align:start size:88% position:13%
the state biologist
with Mass State Fishery

00:14:22.594 --> 00:14:24.930
he's a friend of mine Greg
Schumble, has been conducting

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:26.197
a population study.

00:14:26.197 --> 00:14:28.133
What he does is he
goes out on a boat

00:14:28.133 --> 00:14:29.434
with a big pulpit like this,

00:14:29.434 --> 00:14:32.471
we use spotter planes
to help find the sharks

00:14:32.471 --> 00:14:34.339
and then we get our
boat in position,

00:14:34.339 --> 00:14:35.540
or he gets his boat in position

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:37.476 align:start size:84% position:16%
and he'll put a
little GoPro camera

00:14:37.476 --> 00:14:38.843
on the end of a long pole

00:14:38.843 --> 00:14:40.245
and try to get some video of it.

00:14:40.245 --> 00:14:42.180
And each shark has
unique markings,

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:44.616
they might have scars or
different counter shading

00:14:44.616 --> 00:14:47.219 align:start size:88% position:13%
patterns on them so he's
been able to identify

00:14:47.219 --> 00:14:48.453
in just the last few years

00:14:48.453 --> 00:14:50.689
over 200 individuals.

00:14:50.689 --> 00:14:52.657 align:start size:84% position:16%
So you know Jaws
was about one shark,

00:14:52.657 --> 00:14:54.192
we've got over 200 at least

00:14:54.192 --> 00:14:56.861
and no doubt there's
gonna be a lot more.

00:14:56.861 --> 00:14:59.464 align:start size:97% position:3%
But you can also see in
this picture I made of Greg

00:14:59.464 --> 00:15:02.233 align:start size:97% position:3%
doing that study, how close
they come to the beach.

00:15:02.233 --> 00:15:05.403
This is Nauset Beach in Orleans,

00:15:05.403 --> 00:15:06.671
which is right near Chatham,

00:15:06.671 --> 00:15:08.907
most popular beach on Cape Cod.

00:15:08.907 --> 00:15:10.642 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I was out there
for two seasons

00:15:10.642 --> 00:15:13.678
and everyday I'd see surfers
and boogie borders and people.

00:15:13.678 --> 00:15:17.348
One day these guys saw
me out there in the boat

00:15:17.348 --> 00:15:19.551
and they scratched in the words

00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:22.854 align:start size:88% position:13%
shark with a question
mark on the beach there.

00:15:22.854 --> 00:15:25.790 align:start size:84% position:16%
So I climbed up on
top of the pilot house

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:27.293
and I yelled, yes.

00:15:28.727 --> 00:15:30.729
There is one right here.

00:15:31.897 --> 00:15:33.398
So far we've been
able to co-exist

00:15:33.398 --> 00:15:35.767
and the sharks seem
very discriminating

00:15:35.767 --> 00:15:36.669
about what they're hunting

00:15:36.669 --> 00:15:38.370
but who knows.

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:40.939
But photographically, this
was one of the most difficult

00:15:40.939 --> 00:15:42.274
things I've ever done.

00:15:42.274 --> 00:15:44.376 align:start size:84% position:16%
These are completely
wild sharks,

00:15:44.376 --> 00:15:45.843
they can't be chummed in.

00:15:45.843 --> 00:15:48.013
They have no interest as a rule

00:15:48.013 --> 00:15:49.881
in coming close to the boat.

00:15:49.881 --> 00:15:51.049
The researchers up there

00:15:51.049 --> 00:15:53.018 align:start size:84% position:16%
have used all kinds
of attractance

00:15:53.018 --> 00:15:54.519
and things and nothing works

00:15:54.519 --> 00:15:56.021
to get em close to the boat.

00:15:56.021 --> 00:15:57.389
So my first season up there,

00:15:57.389 --> 00:16:00.091 align:start size:88% position:13%
the best I could do
was a pole cam picture.

00:16:00.091 --> 00:16:02.761
This is a picture I made
while our boat was underway

00:16:02.761 --> 00:16:05.631
of one of these giant
great white sharks

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:07.099
in that very murky water.

00:16:07.099 --> 00:16:09.268
There's lots of currents, you
couldn't use a cage there,

00:16:09.268 --> 00:16:10.468
you wouldn't see anything

00:16:10.468 --> 00:16:12.037
and the currents
would blow it over.

00:16:12.037 --> 00:16:15.440 align:start size:94% position:6%
Pretty impressive tail
though, right, shark tail.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.643
But I eventually figured
that what I needed to do

00:16:18.643 --> 00:16:20.345
was build a seal decoy.

00:16:20.345 --> 00:16:23.348
So I went back to my
friends at Woods Hole

00:16:23.348 --> 00:16:25.150
and we built this
big great seal.

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:26.818
We tried to make it as
authentic as possible,

00:16:26.818 --> 00:16:28.853
like an adult grey seal.

00:16:28.853 --> 00:16:31.723 align:start size:88% position:13%
I had the head sculpted
by a model maker

00:16:31.723 --> 00:16:35.126
and we put cameras inside
with fiber optic cables

00:16:35.126 --> 00:16:37.595
and I could watch in
real time and live view

00:16:37.595 --> 00:16:39.064
back on the boat.

00:16:39.064 --> 00:16:41.733 align:start size:97% position:3%
We had a little wet suit
carved like a seal body here

00:16:41.733 --> 00:16:44.202
and we would deploy it day
and night, day and night,

00:16:44.202 --> 00:16:46.938
day and night, and nothing.

00:16:46.938 --> 00:16:49.308 align:start size:84% position:16%
Sharks had absolutely
no interest.

00:16:49.308 --> 00:16:51.009 align:start size:94% position:6%
They were laughing as
they gave me the fingers,

00:16:51.009 --> 00:16:53.011
they just went by.

00:16:53.011 --> 00:16:54.246
And that was about it.

00:16:54.246 --> 00:16:56.915
So over the winter
I went home dejected

00:16:56.915 --> 00:16:58.784 align:start size:84% position:16%
and wasn't sure I
was gonna have story.

00:16:58.784 --> 00:17:00.252 align:start size:84% position:16%
I didn't know if I'd
get any pictures.

00:17:00.252 --> 00:17:02.053 align:start size:94% position:6%
But over the winter I
talked to a friend of mine

00:17:02.053 --> 00:17:03.588
who's a veterinarian on Cape Cod

00:17:03.588 --> 00:17:05.190
and also a shark researcher

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:06.991
and he had also been
working on his own

00:17:06.991 --> 00:17:08.693
seal decoy design.

00:17:08.693 --> 00:17:10.128
And he had perfected it.

00:17:10.128 --> 00:17:11.496
He got it to a point where

00:17:11.496 --> 00:17:13.231
it was a much simpler design.

00:17:13.231 --> 00:17:15.467
A much smaller seal design,

00:17:15.467 --> 00:17:17.569
only about three or
four feet in length.

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:20.171 align:start position:0%
And he said he was having a
little bit of success with this.

00:17:20.171 --> 00:17:23.075
So I took his design and I
adapted my cameras to it.

00:17:23.075 --> 00:17:25.076
What I needed to do
was put a wireless

00:17:25.076 --> 00:17:27.479 align:start size:94% position:6%
underwater camera in
there that I could trigger

00:17:27.479 --> 00:17:28.881
from hundreds of yards away,

00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:30.448 align:start size:84% position:16%
I didn't want any
cables in the water.

00:17:30.448 --> 00:17:33.618
And I also had to have real
time video in there as well

00:17:33.618 --> 00:17:35.386
that I could see on the boat.

00:17:35.386 --> 00:17:37.956
So I deployed these last summer

00:17:39.057 --> 00:17:41.259
and the sharks were interested.

00:17:41.259 --> 00:17:43.895
Now the trick was you wanted one

00:17:43.895 --> 00:17:45.863
that would come up
and check it out,

00:17:45.863 --> 00:17:48.032 align:start size:84% position:16%
but you didn't want
one that would eat it,

00:17:48.032 --> 00:17:50.668
because that would be very bad.

00:17:50.668 --> 00:17:53.972 align:start position:0%
And that happened, that happened
on a number of occasions

00:17:53.972 --> 00:17:56.208 align:start size:94% position:6%
where the great white
would come up and destroy

00:17:56.208 --> 00:17:57.976
the seal decoy.

00:17:57.976 --> 00:17:59.578 align:start size:88% position:13%
We had ones that didn't
have cameras in em

00:17:59.578 --> 00:18:03.281
but em, so this is
maybe 30 or 40 yards

00:18:03.281 --> 00:18:05.917
off Monomoy beach in Chatham.

00:18:05.917 --> 00:18:08.219 align:start size:97% position:3%
Well this picture was
published in the July issue.

00:18:08.219 --> 00:18:10.621 align:start position:0%
The Cape Cod chamber of
commerce was especially pleased.

00:18:10.621 --> 00:18:13.058
They sent me thank you notes.

00:18:15.026 --> 00:18:17.663 align:start size:84% position:16%
But it's an
interesting behavior.

00:18:17.663 --> 00:18:19.598 align:start size:94% position:6%
What's happening here
it's not like South Africa

00:18:19.598 --> 00:18:21.033 align:start size:94% position:6%
where these animals are
breaching out of the water

00:18:21.033 --> 00:18:21.966
and so forth,

00:18:21.966 --> 00:18:24.036
but it is unique in the world

00:18:24.036 --> 00:18:26.171
and there's a lot more
that needs to be studied.

00:18:26.171 --> 00:18:28.907 align:start size:97% position:3%
I have a little video that
shows some of that decoy work.

00:18:28.907 --> 00:18:31.310
(slow music)

00:19:32.537 --> 00:19:34.272
so using that system
I was able to produce

00:19:34.272 --> 00:19:36.040 align:start size:84% position:16%
the very first
under water pictures

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.376 align:start size:84% position:16%
of a great white shark
in Cape Cod waters.

00:19:38.376 --> 00:19:41.213 align:start position:0%
One of these days where the
shark just sort of was curious,

00:19:41.213 --> 00:19:44.416 align:start size:94% position:6%
came up to the seal and
using that rig on the boat

00:19:44.416 --> 00:19:47.986 align:start size:97% position:3%
where I had the video I could
remotely fire the camera,

00:19:47.986 --> 00:19:50.421
wirelessly fire it and
make these portraits.

00:19:50.421 --> 00:19:51.623
You can see very shallow waters,

00:19:51.623 --> 00:19:52.890
a shadow on the bottom,

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:55.860 align:start size:84% position:16%
maybe five feet
depth here of water.

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:58.863
And very murky, this one
had pilot fish with it

00:19:58.863 --> 00:20:00.799
and this one I named Mike Tyson

00:20:00.799 --> 00:20:04.202
because he had a little
tattoo on his face there.

00:20:04.202 --> 00:20:06.138 align:start size:97% position:3%
I think those are scratches
from the seal but,

00:20:06.138 --> 00:20:10.208 align:start size:94% position:6%
I think we certainly have
a very long way to go

00:20:10.208 --> 00:20:12.744 align:start size:84% position:16%
in truly understanding
these sharks.

00:20:12.744 --> 00:20:14.846 align:start size:88% position:13%
We may never understand
em, but each year

00:20:14.846 --> 00:20:16.347 align:start size:84% position:16%
I think we're
peeling back layers

00:20:16.347 --> 00:20:18.350
and learning a little bit more.

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:23.254 align:start size:97% position:3%
And I have to say that despite
the devastating decline

00:20:23.254 --> 00:20:26.357
of sharks, all species of
sharks around the planet,

00:20:26.357 --> 00:20:28.827
I think we're maybe
at a point now where

00:20:28.827 --> 00:20:30.328
we're turning the corner,

00:20:30.328 --> 00:20:31.930
where we're beginning to
appreciate these animals,

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:34.699
through photography and film
we're creating a new ethic

00:20:34.699 --> 00:20:37.669
and maybe we're coming
to the understanding

00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:39.671 align:start size:84% position:16%
that the world is
indeed a better place

00:20:39.671 --> 00:20:41.305
with sharks in it.

00:20:41.305 --> 00:20:44.810
So in closing I think
back to when I began

00:20:46.244 --> 00:20:48.713
looking like Liberace here.

00:20:48.713 --> 00:20:51.382
Many decades ago when
I was spending time

00:20:51.382 --> 00:20:53.184
on stinky fishing boats,

00:20:53.184 --> 00:20:54.753
ladeling churm into the sea

00:20:54.753 --> 00:20:58.990 align:start size:97% position:3%
in hopes of just seeing a
shark and I didn't know then,

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:00.959 align:start size:84% position:16%
those decades ago that
in the years ahead,

00:21:00.959 --> 00:21:02.827
I would actually find
myself in the company

00:21:02.827 --> 00:21:05.797
of many many sharks and I
couldn't have known then

00:21:05.797 --> 00:21:08.299 align:start size:84% position:16%
that I would come
to see these animals

00:21:08.299 --> 00:21:10.034
as a species in peril.

00:21:10.034 --> 00:21:11.336
That for all their strength,

00:21:11.336 --> 00:21:14.873
they remain fragile and
completely powerless

00:21:14.873 --> 00:21:17.809
against the overfishing
that's eradicating them

00:21:17.809 --> 00:21:19.377
from our oceans.

00:21:19.377 --> 00:21:21.512
So all these years
later I find myself

00:21:21.512 --> 00:21:25.016 align:start size:97% position:3%
still on boats in less than
comfortable conditions,

00:21:25.016 --> 00:21:27.218
decades spent at sea,

00:21:27.218 --> 00:21:31.356
which is the price I pay for
just a few precious moments

00:21:31.356 --> 00:21:34.625
underwater in the company of
these magnificent animals,

00:21:34.625 --> 00:21:37.061 align:start size:84% position:16%
where I try to shine
a light on them

00:21:37.061 --> 00:21:38.396
and help to tell their story.

00:21:38.396 --> 00:21:41.366 align:start size:88% position:13%
So to end I started with
my blue shark story,

00:21:41.366 --> 00:21:43.601
my very first and i wanted
to end with a little video

00:21:43.601 --> 00:21:46.037
that was done while I
was on Rhode Island.

00:21:46.037 --> 00:21:47.472
It was a one hour documentary

00:21:47.472 --> 00:21:49.441 align:start size:81% position:19%
in the National
Geographic Channel

00:21:49.441 --> 00:21:51.609
about my shark work and
this was in Rhode Island

00:21:51.609 --> 00:21:52.844
when I was looking for Makos

00:21:52.844 --> 00:21:55.146 align:start size:88% position:13%
but I found my old
friends the blue sharks.

00:21:55.146 --> 00:21:57.015
So that'll be the wrap up.

00:21:57.015 --> 00:21:59.451
(soft music)

00:22:08.593 --> 00:22:12.163 align:start size:88% position:13%
My Mako story continues,
this is the third

00:22:12.163 --> 00:22:14.165
location in which I've worked.

00:22:14.165 --> 00:22:17.002
I started in San
Diego California.

00:22:17.002 --> 00:22:20.771
Then earlier this year
I was in New Zealand.

00:22:20.771 --> 00:22:22.040
But these are my home waters.

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:25.577
New England is where I
first started diving.

00:22:38.823 --> 00:22:41.659
So over the last several
days we've seen some Makos,

00:22:41.659 --> 00:22:43.094
but they've been
a little bit shy,

00:22:43.094 --> 00:22:45.530
they haven't really come
in close to the camera

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:49.935 align:start size:97% position:3%
but today was a spectacular
day with blue sharks.

00:22:49.935 --> 00:22:53.338
Blue sharks were the very
first species of shark

00:22:53.338 --> 00:22:56.908 align:start size:94% position:6%
that I ever photographed,
I think it was 1982

00:22:56.908 --> 00:22:59.377
when I was out in
these same waters

00:22:59.377 --> 00:23:04.082 align:start size:97% position:3%
and spent an afternoon
swimming with a blue shark.

00:23:04.082 --> 00:23:06.784 align:start size:84% position:16%
So I have a real fun
place in my heart

00:23:06.784 --> 00:23:07.886
for these animals.

00:23:07.886 --> 00:23:09.721 align:start size:84% position:16%
They're also
stunningly beautiful.

00:23:09.721 --> 00:23:14.158
They're shaped like an aircraft
with these big pectoral fins

00:23:14.158 --> 00:23:16.027
that are like the
wings of a glider

00:23:16.027 --> 00:23:19.397
in this long slender
fusologe like body

00:23:19.397 --> 00:23:21.433
and their Indigo backs,

00:23:21.433 --> 00:23:26.204
and their discolorations
is really quit exquisite.

00:23:26.204 --> 00:23:29.107
To see one or two
on recent trips,

00:23:29.107 --> 00:23:31.810 align:start size:81% position:19%
was sort of the
average but today,

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:33.711
we really hit the jackpot.

00:23:33.711 --> 00:23:38.049 align:start size:88% position:13%
We had over a dozen, I'd
say maybe 15 or more.

00:23:38.049 --> 00:23:41.786 align:start size:97% position:3%
And it's a nice opportunity
when the sun begins to go down

00:23:41.786 --> 00:23:44.588
to start making some
dramatic pictures.

00:23:44.588 --> 00:23:46.124
So I love to work in low light

00:23:46.124 --> 00:23:48.993 align:start size:88% position:13%
where I have some
control over the colors

00:23:48.993 --> 00:23:51.362
and the movement of the animals,

00:23:51.362 --> 00:23:53.197 align:start size:84% position:16%
a great opportunity
for photography

00:23:53.197 --> 00:23:56.435 align:start size:84% position:16%
even though it wasn't
the prime target.

00:23:57.568 --> 00:23:59.203 align:start size:84% position:16%
And what I'm trying
to do with this

00:23:59.203 --> 00:24:03.308
is bring readers into
the world of the shark.

00:24:03.308 --> 00:24:05.776 align:start size:94% position:6%
When you see one, when
you actually see an animal

00:24:05.776 --> 00:24:08.279
like a Mako shark underwater,

00:24:08.279 --> 00:24:09.781 align:start size:84% position:16%
you just can't
believe that nature

00:24:09.781 --> 00:24:12.717 align:start size:84% position:16%
has sculpted
something so perfect.

00:24:12.717 --> 00:24:16.254
Seeing a dozen or more
blue sharks here today

00:24:16.254 --> 00:24:19.090
was a hopeful thing for me.

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:21.025 align:start size:94% position:6%
I know that their numbers
have been dessimated

00:24:21.025 --> 00:24:23.028 align:start size:94% position:6%
throughout the Atlantic
Ocean and this is somewhat

00:24:23.028 --> 00:24:23.962
of an anomaly.

00:24:23.962 --> 00:24:25.931
But it does give me hope.

00:24:31.169 --> 00:24:34.105 align:start position:0%
I believe we're at a moment
where the traction is occurring,

00:24:34.105 --> 00:24:35.940
we're making some momentum,

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:39.811
and if this continues, if we
all keep beating that drum,

00:24:39.811 --> 00:24:42.714
I think the future
could be bright.

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:46.751
Thank you very much.

00:24:46.751 --> 00:24:49.855
(audience applause)
