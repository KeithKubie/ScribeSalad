00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.835
All right, what's next?

00:00:01.835 --> 00:00:04.310
I'm sure you were thinking we now
add it to the default task, and

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:05.460
then to the JavaScript watcher.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.390
And you're half right,
that's what we would ideally do.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.730
But in an ideal world,
we'd have hoverboards and

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.300
unlimited performance on our computers.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.810
Turns out that running complex unit
tests, especially in a headless browser,

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.370
can get really, really slow.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.500
So adding into our watch process
would kill our life editing workflow.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.780
In order to solve this problem,

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.630
smart people invented continuous
integration in the Cloud.
