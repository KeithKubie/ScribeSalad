on certain scenes actors seem like

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870
on certain scenes actors seem like
 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.180
on certain scenes actors seem like
they're in different places like there

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190
they're in different places like there
 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.590

were another scenes and I don't think
it's entirely the actors fault I think

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190
it's entirely the actors fault I think
 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.310
it's entirely the actors fault I think
they're following the direction and a

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320
they're following the direction and a
 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.920
