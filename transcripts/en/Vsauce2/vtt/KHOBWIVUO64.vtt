00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.779
Scientists in South Korea have converted cigarette
butts into material that coats the electrodes

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:09.190
of super capacitors for extremely large amounts
of energy storage.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.930
And this a vampire plant sweet talks its victims
through DNA into lowering their defenses,

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.820
allowing it to tap into them and drain their
fluids.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:17.820
Vsauce!

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.830
Kevin here.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.909
This is Mind Blow.

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:24.339
It turns out most people have herpes.

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:31.529
In the U.S. it’s estimated that 54% of 14-49
year olds have Herpes Simplex 1 and the worldwide

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.840
estimate of HSV-1 (the oral type) and HSV-2
(the genital type) is somewhere between 65%

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.480
and 90%!

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.370
Most people never shown signs of it because
flareups can depend on the strain and the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.820
strength of host’s immune system.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:53.200
And estimates on the older population having
the herpes virus are over 90%.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.790
The Hyperlapse makes your action footage look
like a first person video game.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.390
It smoothes out time-lapse first person video
that’s normally unwatchably shaky by using

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.600
an algorithm that estimates the camera path,
removes redundant frames, and then renders

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.420
a new stitched image blending it all together.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.530
And Microsoft is currently working to make
this publicly available as an app.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.500
The New Horizons NASA probe recently captured
video of Pluto and its largest moon, Charon

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.120
- this is the closest imaging of Pluto ever
- 10 times closer to it than Earth is.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.390
And they’re planning on getting even closer
in January.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.100
The BugJuggler is a 70ft tall robot that juggles
cars.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.110
Or at least that’s the plan.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:41.020
Dan Granett is building a proof-of-principle
arm that will juggle 250 lb cast iron weights

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.760
that will be controlled by a person wearing
a sensor sleeve and glove.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.720
The glove provides haptic feedback - that
way they can feel the weight of the juggled

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.770
object.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.230
With the ultimate goal of building a giant
robot that juggles VW Bugs.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.549
Because...why not?

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.590
Researcher at MIT recovered sound from recording
video of a bag of chips.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.090
The visual microphone uses a high speed camera
to pick up the incredibly subtle vibrations

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.979
on an object’s surface and then those are
extracted to partially recover the sound that

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:11.979
caused them.

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:16.880
For instance, here’s audio of a kid singing
recovered from video of a foil wrapper near

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:24.459
the child at the time.

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.970
Someday you may be able to power your phone
with sweat.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.260
A wearable device similar to a temporary tattoo
features a sensor that measures lactate which

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.040
is produced by sweating.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.640
It strips electrons from the lactate to generate
electrical current which is then stored by

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.640
a biobattery.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.099
Currently, only a tiny amount of power can
be harnessed this way but they’re working

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:50.050
on increasing that so we can eventually power
a heart rate monitor or a smart phone.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:56.060
This real-time facial tracker with projection
mapping can instantaneously change a face.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.849
The software references points on the model’s
face to maintain the projection during movements

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:07.030
- altering it from makeup or paint to more
advanced reflections and digital designs.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.220
And they’re looking for ways to implement
this in movies and games.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.430
Finally, Arc Attack controls an arpeggiator
with Xbox Kinect which outputs midi to a tesla

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:23.490
coil to make music.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:32.590
I’m gonna leave you with a thousand-robot
swarm that self-assembles into shapes and

00:03:32.590 --> 00:04:15.180
as always - thanks for watching.
