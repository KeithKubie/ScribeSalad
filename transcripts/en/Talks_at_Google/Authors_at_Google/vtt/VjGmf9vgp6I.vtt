RICHARD KARLGAARD: Thanks,
I am with "Forbes."

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.680
I've been with "Forbes"
since the early '90s.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.170
In fact, I joined "Forbes."

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.620
Steve Forbes hired me to
start a technology magazine,

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.940
and one of my go-to
people, whenever

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.950
I needed understand this
new thing called the web,

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.780
was a guy who ran R&amp;D at
Sun Microsystems named

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:24.970
Eric Schmidt.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.115
So Eric was always-- Eric was
always a tremendous friend

00:00:28.115 --> 00:00:30.630
and helped me understand
what was emerging

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.790
in the future of network
computing more than just

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.600
about anyone.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.120
Now I live in Silicon Valley, as
does my co-author Mike Malone.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.530
And one day, we were
sitting around noting

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.180
how many great startups
in Silicon Valley

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.150
had been done by pairs,
trios, or quartets--

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.080
from Hewlett Packard, to
Apple, Steve Wozniak and Steve

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.340
Jobs, Sergey Brin and Larry
Page, the Paypal mafia.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.550
I mean, over and over again,
you see the same story

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.580
repeating of very small
teams-- two, three, four,

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.220
five-- starting these
tremendous enterprises.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.760
And so we proposed
to a publisher

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.890
to write a book about that.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.150
The publisher wisely
came back and said, well,

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.570
that'll just be storytelling.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.750
Can you find some science
and data behind this?

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.530
And can you apply it to
large organizations as well?

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.490
So that's what we set out to do.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.360
And Team Genius-- really, we
looked at what neuroscience,

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.430
anthropology, cognition
science, and so on and so forth,

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.370
has to say about why it is
that some small teams thrive

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.960
and others don't.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.840
You've all probably
been on teams

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.120
where everything
looked good on paper.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.180
You had the right set of
skills, and something somehow it

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.266
didn't gel.

00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:52.400
And then you've
probably been on teams

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.550
where everybody on the
team was a pain in the ass

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.080
that you were
fighting all the time.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.460
It seemed like it was always
on the verge of fragmenting,

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.750
and somehow the team
produced great work.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.060
Now, our theory is that all
the great work in the world

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.170
is going to be done by small,
informal teams going forward.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.400
That is the startup
model of small teams.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.900
It's one that is going to apply
in large organizations too.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.680
And the reason is that the
world to simply moving too fast.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.580
Google has 55,000 employees,
but every now and then,

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.330
a company will come up like
Snapchat with 19 employees,

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.140
and seemingly they're
able to do things

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.320
in an extraordinarily
short period of time.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.760
And why is that?

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.280
The world is moving too fast.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.065
So the theory that we
have in Team Genius

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:48.830
is that inside of
large organizations,

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.090
if you're really going
to get work done,

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.000
you have to create
an organization

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.650
where teams of 2 to 12 people,
just like the startup world

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.630
does naturally, inside
of larger organizations,

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.610
teams of 2 to 12 people
can spontaneously

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.070
arise to meet a challenge
or to pursue an opportunity.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.130
Here's the
mathematical reason why

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.190
small teams work and big
teams fall apart very quickly.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.730
That equation, you probably
know, is Metcalfe's Law,

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.340
but it shows just how fast
the number of connections

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.791
rise when you add people.

00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:26.290
And so if you have
two team members,

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.380
you have one connection.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.240
If you have 12 team members, you
have 66 possible connections.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.270
And the reason that 12 starts
breaking down, after 12,

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.760
is that the number
of connections

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.310
go up almost exponentially.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.600
16 team members--
120 connections.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.270
32-- 496.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.870
So things become
unwieldy very quickly.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.320
What breaks in a breakpoint?

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.740
Well, communications,
accountability, and trust

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.700
begin to break down very
rapidly when you get over 12.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.210
You start getting the
phenomenon of free riders.

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.090
That is people-- I'm sure
this doesn't happen at Google,

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.940
But it happens in
every organization

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.210
I've been involved
with that is large.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.360
If a project looks
hot and successful,

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.620
people want to join in.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.440
Everybody wants to be
part of the success.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.772
Then they may not do
the work, but they

00:04:16.772 --> 00:04:18.480
want to have it on
their resume, and they

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.063
want to be able to
take credit for it.

00:04:20.063 --> 00:04:22.480
Conversely, when
things get challenging,

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.260
those kind of people will bail,
will start pointing fingers

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.554
and become politicians.

00:04:28.554 --> 00:04:29.970
Exactly the kind
of thing that you

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.320
don't want in any kind of a
team where you have high stakes

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.170
and you need to accomplish
stuff in a hurry.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.980
Here's what we found
out, the research.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.040
And these researchers
are cited in the book.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.510
One is a neuroscientist.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.760
One is an anthropologist.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.720
One is a social psychologist.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.400
And that is the optimal
size of creative teams.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.820
Remember, I said 2 to 12
is sort of a good range

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.570
of creative strike teams.

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.380
And amazingly,
within that range,

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.610
things begin to tighten up.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.840
These three researchers
from different fields

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.280
have used numbers like
7, 5 to 7, and 4 to 9.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.190
I like 4 to 9.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.070
I call it 7 plus or minus 2.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.100
And the book goes into why teams
of that size, whether you're

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.730
talking about musical bands,
artistic groups, software

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.740
projects, marketing launches,
PR launches-- whatever

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.010
it is, this is an optimal size.

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.220
And there are reasons why
the brain prefers that size.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.380
In fact, the size of seven
as a phone number-- the phone

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.340
company didn't come up with the
size seven for a phone number

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.660
accidentally.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.840
It turns out that that's
the median of short term

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.420
memory for people.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.581
Software people obviously have
super short term memories,

00:05:52.581 --> 00:05:54.330
which means that there
are a lot of people

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.030
walking around that have
crappy short term memories.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.820
But seven is the median for
the vast majority of people,

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.170
and that's why,
again, it accords

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.940
to the people you can hold
in your brain and the ideas

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.160
that you can hold in your
brain as you're walking around.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.920
Well, Google has
55,000 employees.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.367
Does this still apply?

00:06:15.367 --> 00:06:16.950
I'm going to make
the argument that it

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.160
makes no difference what the
size of the organization is.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.750
That it's the task
of Google to be able,

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.615
to out of 55,000 people, all
of whom are super bright.

00:06:26.615 --> 00:06:28.740
This friend of mine likes
to say to work at Google,

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.960
you have to have an
IQ that boils water.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.300
But even inside
that 55,000 people,

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:41.110
unless you can spontaneously
get to these smaller sizes,

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.390
projects get bogged down.

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:45.900
The Snapchats of the world
with a tiny number of people

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.430
can pop up.

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.650
And while you're trying to
organize teams from on high,

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.690
Snapchat has developed
tens of millions of users.

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.810
That's why doing things
on a startup level

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.520
becomes so important.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.690
Now, one of things we
wanted to do in the book

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:07.790
was take on some of the
more controversial areas

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:10.000
and see what research
had to say about that.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.790
One of them is diversity,
specifically ethnic and gender

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.050
diversity.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.790
And the research says that
it's a double edged sword,

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:23.700
that there's a much higher beta
when you have a diverse team

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.290
than when you have a team that
is monolithic, that everybody

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.200
looks the same, everybody
has the same color skin,

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.780
everybody has the same gender.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:36.300
By higher beta, I mean
that a truly diverse team

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:40.370
has a higher probability of
creating extraordinary success.

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.920
And it also has a higher
probability of blowing up.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:48.400
Now, if you're a global
company, we are at Forbes.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.130
Google is.

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:50.560
Anybody that
touches the internet

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.220
is by definition a
global company today.

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.240
You have to take the risk.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.970
If you're maybe a local
construction company,

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:00.750
and you're not touched
by the global economy,

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:03.290
perhaps you can have
a very monolithic team

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:04.480
and it will work.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.040
But in a global
economy, anything

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:10.110
that's creative, the research
is very strong about this

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:14.170
that you have to,
whether you're doing it

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:16.850
for good reasons
of social justice

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.860
or whether you
want to accomplish

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.740
big things in a
global economy, you

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:25.690
have to take the risk
of being diverse.

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:28.517
The way that you
protect the downside-- I

00:08:28.517 --> 00:08:29.600
said it has a higher beta.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.425
You have a greater probability
of accomplishing great things,

00:08:32.425 --> 00:08:34.049
but you also have a
greater probability

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:35.830
of having the team blow up.

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:38.760
The way that you prevent
the team from blowing up

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.330
is with strong leadership
and the right framing.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.539
And I'm going to talk a
little bit about framing

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:45.390
in the next slide.

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:46.730
So here's the framing quiz.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.020
Which of the following framing
strategies-- and remember,

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.340
this is back on the
topic of diversity.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.600
And you're a leader of
a highly diverse team.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.620
You have different ethnicities.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.520
You're balanced in gender.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.790
Which of the following
three framing strategies

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:05.070
produces the best results?

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:09.320
And this is according to Harvard
researchers Robin Eli and David

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.090
Thomas.

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:12.500
OK.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.660
Number one, you have
three choices here--

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.840
integration and
learning perspective,

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.370
diversity as a mechanism
for helping teams enhance

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:22.560
their capacity for adaptive
change, your differences

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.450
and experience will
help us react quickly

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:27.630
to a rapidly
changing marketplace.

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.190
Now choice number two,
remember you're the leader.

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:31.690
You're trying to frame.

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:33.810
You're trying to
get the best out

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:36.070
of everybody in a
highly diverse team.

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:38.390
Number two, you frame it as
diversity is a better way

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:41.310
to connect with an increasingly
diverse marketplace.

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:43.080
Your differences and
cultural backgrounds

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.200
will help us understand
the global marketplace.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.730
That's choice number two.

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:50.800
And now choice number three,
discrimination and fairness

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.360
perspective.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.360
Diversity as a means to ensuring
fair equal treatment of all.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.865
Our differences
ensure that there

00:09:55.865 --> 00:09:59.210
will be no bias against anyone.

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:02.300
Who thinks the
optimal is number one?

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.490
If you recall it.

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:07.310
Who thinks the
optimal is number two?

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:11.050
And that's diversity because
the marketplace is diverse,

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:13.000
therefore we should be diverse.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.990
And who thinks
it's number three?

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.920
OK.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.220
The winner is the first one.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:21.190
The integration and learning
experience perspective.

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:24.800
And that is using diversity
to make everybody smarter

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.250
on the team.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:29.310
Discrimination and
fairness perspective-- eh.

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:31.420
Mixed results.

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:35.920
A lot of evidence suggests
that for all the inclusion

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.100
you might create with
that kind of perspective,

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:41.900
it also feels patronizing
to many people.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.230
And surprisingly, the loser
is the access legitimacy

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:45.960
perspective.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:49.460
It simply doesn't work,
according to these two Harvard

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.020
researchers.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.590
Here's a huge one.

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:57.000
If you take away two
ideas from the book,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.220
the two ideas that are the
major work in the world

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:03.040
is getting done by
teams of 2 to 12 people.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.780
And that works
fine for startups,

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:07.560
because they are 2 to 12 people.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:11.090
But if you have 55,000
people, you still

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:13.300
have to create
these organizations

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.290
where teams of 2 to
12 will spring up

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:19.030
spontaneously to solve a
problem or to meet a customer

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:19.990
opportunity.

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:22.850
If the team creation is
being ordered from on high,

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:25.420
you simply won't be
moving fast enough

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:26.910
to meet the challenges today.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:28.770
That's idea number one.

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:32.280
The second idea is the power
of cognitive diversity.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.490
And that is creating what
Tony Fidel, Tony Fidel,

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:38.580
of course, the guy who created
Nest Labs, and you guys

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.530
bought him in April, 2014.

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:47.290
Tony also is known as one of the
founders of the iPod, Apple's

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.290
breakout product.

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:53.810
Jonathan Rubinstein, Steve
Jobs, Tony Fidel did that.

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:58.650
And Tony, when I interviewed
Tony for a previous book--

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:00.900
Google is a very
algorithmic company.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:07.830
And when Tony was designing
the smart thermostat,

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:09.930
he explained how it
worked, a thermostat that

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:11.590
learns your habits.

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:13.560
And he said, is that
an algorithmic problem

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:16.310
or is that a sociology problem?

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:18.890
Is it just simply observing
how people behave?

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:19.920
And he said it's both.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:23.520
He said the problem is the
algorithmic people alone

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.370
will come up with one solution.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:28.800
The non-algorithmic people will
come up with another solution.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.050
And neither of them are
really great solutions

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:32.510
in and of themselves.

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:34.550
So what Tony always
tried to do, and I

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:36.580
think what great
companies do, Google

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:39.590
does this exceptionally
well-- is mash up what

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:41.820
he calls whole brain teams.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:43.800
And that is within
these small teams,

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.631
you want to make sure that you
have left brain and right brain

00:12:46.631 --> 00:12:47.130
thinkers.

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:48.770
You want introverts
and extroverts.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:51.910
There's a great book by a
woman named Susan Cain called

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:53.310
"The Power of Quiet."

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:56.630
And it's really the power of
introverts in an organization.

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:59.320
Introverts are often very
underestimated inside

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.310
of an organization because
they don't speak up.

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:04.940
Risk IQ.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.900
Everybody talks about risk
today and the importance

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.140
of being a risk
taking organization.

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:13.880
You actually want, in a
composition of a team,

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.970
you want conformists too.

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:19.960
You want the risk takers
to be about 25 to 20%

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.420
of the composition of the team.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.612
You want the conformists
to be about half,

00:13:23.612 --> 00:13:25.070
and you want the
rest of the people

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:29.220
to be strictly hard
focused operations people.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.120
The reason you want
the conformists

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.890
is that the risk people
will be passionate for sure,

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:38.380
but they will run off the rails
if left to their own devices

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:41.450
as many times as not
more times than not.

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:43.250
And so the value of
conformance, even

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:48.700
at a highly evolutionary company
like Google, is very valuable.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.450
You want tenure diversity.

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:52.330
That is to say, you
want experienced people

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.700
who can see all the
traps going forward

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.930
on a project, all the
political landmines,

00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:59.890
all of the things that
can trip up a project.

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:01.470
But you also want
the fresh eyes,

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:03.800
because the problem
is with having

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.720
a lot a tenure is the "been
there, done that" cynicism

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.640
that begins to
creep in over time.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.100
Now I briefly want to talk
about-- this alludes to a book

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.560
that I had last year.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.670
And the two go together.

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:18.300
The book I had last year
was called "The Soft Edge."

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:19.950
My proposition
here is everything

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:22.300
I've talked about won't
happen in a culture

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.390
where you don't have trust.

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:27.100
This is one of things that
Satya Nadella's discovered

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:30.740
at Microsoft, is that the
Ballmer culture was so hard

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:34.170
wired for measurable results.

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:36.120
And the way
employees were ranked

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.020
within Microsoft, a
forced ranking system,

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.170
that, in fact, the
knives came out,

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:44.680
particularly the
top two quintiles.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:47.612
If you're in the top
quintiles at Microsoft,

00:14:47.612 --> 00:14:51.010
all the raises and all the
bonuses went to the people

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:52.170
in the top quintile.

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:55.439
People in the second quintile
got to keep their jobs.

00:14:55.439 --> 00:14:57.980
People in the third, fourth,
and fifth-- the fifth forget it.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.270
Third and fourth were kind
of on the bubble about

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:02.180
whether they'd be able
to keep their job.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:05.440
But all the knives and
all the political wars

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.980
came out at the borderline
between the top quintile

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:11.230
and the second quintile,
because all the raises, and all

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:14.610
the accolades, and
all the promotions

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:16.340
went to people in
the top quintile.

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:18.760
So the trust was shattered.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.690
When I was doing the
research on that book

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:23.210
to figure out what it is that
creates a healthy culture

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:26.790
inside of a company,
I googled health.

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:30.130
And if you google health, this
is one of the top three things

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.982
that you will get when you
google the word health.

00:15:32.982 --> 00:15:34.690
It's this thing called
the United Nations

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:36.130
Triangle of Health.

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.197
This is what the
UN gives to doctors

00:15:38.197 --> 00:15:40.030
who go into impoverished
areas of the world,

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:42.830
Doctors Without Borders,
organizations like that.

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:45.305
People who need to see
1,000 patients in a week.

00:15:45.305 --> 00:15:47.680
If you're seeing 1,000 patients
in a week, all you can do

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.480
is triage, and this is the
tool to help you triage.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.230
You look at somebody,
and in five minutes,

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:54.010
you try to determine
whether it's

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:55.610
physically healthy,
mentally healthy,

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:58.900
and have social health, which
means when they go home,

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.280
is there violence in their
families or lawlessness

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.780
in their village, and so forth.

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:04.890
And the proposition
is to be truly healthy

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:07.690
and to have predictably
good health going forward,

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:10.240
you have to have good
health on all three sides.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.690
Take away any one of
these three things,

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:14.410
you jeopardize
somebody's health.

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:17.090
You could be a young man
with robust physical health

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:19.460
and great mental and
emotional clarity,

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:22.100
but if you live in
a war torn village,

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.950
that's why you need
all three sides.

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:27.650
So about 15 months ago, I'm
talking to-- now two years ago,

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:31.791
I'm talking to one of my
favorite entrepreneurs outside

00:16:31.791 --> 00:16:33.790
of the technology industry,
but they're actually

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:37.340
a very technology
driven company.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:41.240
Fred Smith, founder and CEO of
FedEx, now $50 billion in size.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:42.550
There once was not a FedEx.

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:46.470
He started it from
raw scratch in 1971.

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:48.670
And I asked him what
accounts for FedEx

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:51.280
being successful
over the long term,

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.530
being able to
survive recessions,

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:56.590
global turmoil, new
competitors coming in,

00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:59.110
big technology transitions.

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.140
And he made the
picture of a triangle,

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.720
and he said we are a
triangle of forces.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:09.160
We have to be good at strategy,
execution, and culture.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:13.950
I called execution the hard edge
simply because it's measurable.

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:16.339
The soft edge of
culture is beginning

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:19.420
to be measurable
thanks to Laszlo Bock,

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:21.170
thanks to companies like Google.

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:24.920
But we're way in the
early days of that.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.250
And that's why people tend
to underinvest in that.

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:29.040
This is my favorite,
big data sports.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.000
I have to tell this.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000
It takes about a minute.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.360
It's how Jennie finch--
this is 10 years ago

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.830
in a demonstration during
spring training in Major League

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:37.820
Baseball.

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:39.360
The world's best
softball pitcher

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.390
struck out the two best
hitters in baseball

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:42.670
on three successive pitches.

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:43.910
They didn't each.

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:46.080
Neither of them got
even a foul ball.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.220
And how did she do that?

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:50.980
Because it's amazing that when
you throw a softball 65 miles

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:56.482
an hour-- she can or could-- it
gets to the plate in about 4/10

00:17:56.482 --> 00:17:58.940
of a second, which is the same
time it takes a Major League

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:03.100
Fastball, 95 miles an hour
thrown from a longer distance,

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:04.640
to get to the plate too.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.310
So in theory, it
looks like it if it

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:11.390
takes the same amount
of time and there's

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:13.780
40% more surface
space on a softball,

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:15.140
it should be easier to hit.

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:16.860
Why is not easier to hit?

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:20.640
And the answer is It's
a big data problem.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.850
Bonds and Pujols
could see everything.

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:27.074
A Major League Baseball
batter can get the bat

00:18:27.074 --> 00:18:28.740
around in about 2/10s
of a second, which

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:31.962
means they have 2/10 of a second
to determine what the pitch is,

00:18:31.962 --> 00:18:33.920
where it's going to go,
the speed of the pitch,

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.110
and so forth.

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:38.450
They could see it, but they
didn't know how to read it.

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:42.250
It was simply a big
data problem for them.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:45.480
You've all heard of Malcolm
Gladwell's "10,000 Hours."

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.420
They had the 10,000
hours in baseball.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:48.740
They could read a baseball.

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:51.399
They could read the
pattern that the yarn made.

00:18:51.399 --> 00:18:52.940
They could read the
pitcher's motion.

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:55.160
They didn't know what they were
looking at was Jennie Finch,

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.951
even though it was
right before their eyes.

00:18:56.951 --> 00:19:01.370
Everybody talks about
corporate culture today.

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:03.980
Very few companies--
Google is one of the few

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.620
that really walks the talk.

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.940
And the reason it is so
very hard for companies--

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.690
and it may be even
challenging for Google.

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:12.130
You're a publicly
traded company.

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:13.505
You have to report
to Wall Street

00:19:13.505 --> 00:19:17.030
four times a year-- is it
there's a built in bias

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:21.302
to fall back on measurable
and analytical things.

00:19:21.302 --> 00:19:22.760
And particularly
because all of you

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:26.750
are so analytically gifted
and mathematically gifted,

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:29.740
it's your natural
default position anyway.

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:33.592
But I just want to make the case
that the cultural values side,

00:19:33.592 --> 00:19:35.300
which increasingly is
getting measurable,

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.510
but it's not that
measurable today.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:40.360
This is not a new
debate about the debate

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:45.385
between how much effort do you
put into corporate culture.

00:19:45.385 --> 00:19:46.760
This is the guy
who invented what

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:49.730
was called scientific management
named Fredrick Taylor.

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:51.380
He took a stopwatch
and a clipboard

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:54.690
to factory floors
in the late 1800s.

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:57.060
First person to really take
advantage of his findings

00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:57.720
was Henry Ford.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.715
The Model T came out in 1908.

00:19:59.715 --> 00:20:03.300
But it was 1913 when the
first assembly line was built,

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.180
and all of a sudden the
volume and the affordability

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.920
curve of Model T's just
got very, very attractive

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.910
to the point where Ford,
who paid his workers well,

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:15.580
could afford to buy the
car that they were making.

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:17.080
That had never been done.

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:20.290
By 1926, they're rolling
of the assembly line.

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:22.650
Ford is the dominant motor
car company in the world.

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:24.630
Then came the Great Depression.

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:27.480
Ford had labor problems.

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:31.070
People were complaining about
the dehumanizing factory floor.

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:34.540
See, Taylor had treated
people like machines.

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:35.920
You stood at the assembly line.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:39.620
You did the same thing over
and over and over again

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.590
for 10 hours a day,
six days a week,

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:44.080
which was a typical
work week back then.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:49.260
And Henry Ford didn't handle
the labor strikes very well.

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:51.000
And it really kind
of wrecked him.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.410
You see, he couldn't understand,
during the Great Depression,

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:58.340
If he was paying people twice
the prevailing wage for factory

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:02.220
work, and the people were
employed to begin with,

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:05.890
because there was 25%
unemployment during the 1930s,

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:09.150
why his workers
were turning on him.

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:11.220
He went from being
this very creative guy

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:15.490
to this very bitter guy in
a very short period of time.

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:19.560
During the 1940s, he did not
distinguish himself very well

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:24.800
by being pro-Nazi,
and anti-Semitic,

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.990
and all kinds of bad things.

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:29.960
He just became a very,
very bitter angry guy,

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:33.000
because he couldn't
understand, fundamentally,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.460
how he could have created
this great product

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:38.210
and these great jobs for people
and his workers turned on him.

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:39.960
Well, they turned on
him because they were

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.126
being treated like machines.

00:21:41.126 --> 00:21:42.970
Along comes Alfred
Sloan, who was

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:45.360
able to copy the Ford--
he's the head of General

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:49.220
Motors-- able to copy the Ford
methodology on the factory

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:49.720
floor.

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:52.490
But he also had insight
into human nature, which

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:55.820
is both good for workplace
relationships at General Motors

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:58.750
and for his insights on
marketing segmentation.

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:00.840
Henry Ford liked to
say about the Model T,

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:04.090
you can have it any color you
want as long as it's black.

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:06.410
General Motors invented
market segmentation--

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:08.980
the Chevrolet, Pontiac,
The Oldsmobile, the Buick,

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:12.160
the Cadillac-- for different
parts of the market.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.130
And so in the '30s, General
Motors went one way.

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:16.920
Ford went the other way.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:17.950
Ford went on a roll.

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:19.700
That's the '53 Corvette.

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:23.890
And then it eventually succumbed
to the analytic financial

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:24.600
temptation.

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.040
It became by the 1970s
and '80s, a company that

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.830
was managed for the numbers.

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:32.670
It was managed for
shareholder profits.

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:35.410
It was managed for
the stock price.

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:38.950
And eventually led from
cars like the 1953 Corvette

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:41.830
to the 1986 Cadillac
Cimarron, which

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:44.700
makes everybody's list of
one of the worst cars ever,

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:46.900
because it was a Chevy.

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.284
See, the analytical people
and the finance people

00:22:49.284 --> 00:22:51.450
who were managing the company
for shareholder profit

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:53.935
thought if you put a
Cadillac grill on a Chevrolet

00:22:53.935 --> 00:22:56.770
and you called it a Cadillac and
charged twice as much for it,

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:59.060
man, will the numbers spike.

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:00.670
We're going to look so good.

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:03.170
Customers didn't
have the feedback.

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:06.780
There weren't things
like Facebook today where

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:10.150
people could carp about it.

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:12.660
And so it worked until
it stopped working.

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:15.430
Then when it stopped working,
it stopped working major time.

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:19.100
One of the fascinating ideas
to me-- and as you look around,

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:23.160
this is pretty easily confirmed
by your own observations-

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:26.780
Is do jerks win in
the marketplace?

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:30.975
Do you have to be a jerk to
run a great company today?

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:36.260
The company with a large
market value in the world,

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:38.580
the company that is sometimes
your friend and sometimes

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:43.040
your competitor, the great
man who started the company

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:46.870
and led its revival the second
time around, Steve Jobs,

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:49.460
was in many ways
brilliant but in many ways

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.720
was a class A jerk.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:56.080
And he leaves us with this
uncomfortable question,

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:58.950
and that is, do you have
to be a jerk to succeed?

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:02.110
How many of you have read Elon
Musk's-- the biography on Elan

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:03.355
Musk by Ashley Vance?

00:24:03.355 --> 00:24:04.540
It's a great book.

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:06.210
Brilliant man.

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:08.780
Works harder than
anybody, but he

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:13.230
has qualities that could
be described, academically,

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:18.010
in academic terms, as
being in A-hole many times.

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:21.810
And so the question is,
those people are successful.

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:24.390
Then when you look at the
other end of the spectrum,

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:27.840
I'm sure Google has some people
inside the organization that

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:30.790
are, out of 55,000
people, it's inevitable

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:32.820
that you'll have
people like that.

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:35.230
But on the whole, when
you look at Google

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:37.760
and how Google almost
always makes the top five

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.520
and I think more recently
in the last year,

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:43.910
the very top ranked company
in best places to work,

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:47.660
where you look at an analytics
company in North Carolina, SAS,

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:50.950
always makes to the top five
list of companies to work.

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:55.510
Great corporate campus,
all kinds of perks.

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:59.120
People are treated with
great respect at SAS.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:03.670
And the question is,
why do both work?

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:04.810
Both models work.

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:06.490
You can win being
good people and you

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:09.690
can win being kind
of on the rough side.

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:12.760
And the answer is, it
goes to authenticity.

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:16.550
And the authenticity-- the
companies that get stuck

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:20.080
are the ones that can't decide
whether they're meritocracies

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.140
or sort of collective efforts.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:24.610
And they toggle back and forth.

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:25.990
And that's where
the danger lies.

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:30.360
So the companies can be
harshly meritocratic.

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:33.000
Amazon's harshly meritocratic.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Elon Musk's companies
are harshly meritocratic.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.350
I think Google was probably
more harshly meritocratic

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:40.340
in its early days.

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:44.590
And something that Laszlo Bock
talks about in his great book,

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:49.590
"Work Rules," but it has become
much broader and much more,

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:53.440
I think, inclusive and
respective of the individual.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.600
Microsoft is harshly
meritocratic,

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.750
and it worked until
it stopped working.

00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:00.400
And one of the things that
Satya Nadella, the new CEO

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.520
of Microsoft is
trying to do today

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:06.280
is to restore a more
collaborative culture

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:09.680
that Microsoft lost
under Steve Ballmer.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.580
So what I wanted
to say is that this

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:14.390
is what a great
organization looks like.

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:16.360
They're great in strategy,
great in execution,

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.840
great in cultural
values, and particularly

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.280
the cultural values side.

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:24.010
But all three sides are
absolutely critical if you're

00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:25.620
going to have the
conditions that

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:30.570
create teams of 2 to 12
people to spontaneously arise.

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:33.770
If you don't have the trust
factor, it isn't going to work.

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:36.970
Steve Jobs, I thought it would
be daring to mention Steve Jobs

00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:40.520
and hold him up at
a Google meeting.

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:41.290
But here I am.

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:43.390
I'm stuck now.

00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:47.500
He's often held up as this
great, solo, maverick, iconic

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.100
entrepreneur.

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:53.130
People mistakenly think that he
started the Macintosh project.

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:55.740
He didn't start the
Macintosh project.

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:58.460
That he invented the iPod,
the iPhone, and so forth.

00:26:58.460 --> 00:26:59.420
He didn't.

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:02.720
In fact, the unrecognized
genius of Steve Jobs

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:06.090
was his ability to
pair up with people

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:09.970
who were his complementary,
his opposite in temperament

00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:13.010
and skill, who made him whole.

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:16.220
Steve Wozniak in the
beginning, his worst failure

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:19.630
was that because of a bad
pairing with John Sculley,

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:23.670
he got his mojo back when he
paired with the Pixar people.

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:26.200
And that really taught Steve
how to become a better manager.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.991
When he came back the
second time at Apple,

00:27:27.991 --> 00:27:29.570
he was a superb manager.

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:33.860
And he always liked to say-- and
he said this in a "60 Minutes"

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:37.900
interview in the last years of
this life-- where his business

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:39.680
philosophy came from.

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:41.230
Because he was
not a good leader.

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:44.610
He was a really charismatic
visionary his first time

00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:46.830
around at Apple, but he
was not the great CEO

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:49.830
that we know of until it
was the second time around.

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:51.930
Where did you get that idea?

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:55.760
What was your
fundamental teaching?

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.360
You didn't finish college.

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.180
You didn't take
management courses.

00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:01.560
And here's what he
told "60 Minutes."

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:03.340
"My model for business
is The Beatles.

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:05.500
They were four guys that
kept each other's negative

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:06.986
tendencies in check.

00:28:06.986 --> 00:28:09.110
They balanced each other,
and the total was greater

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:10.750
than the sum of the parts.

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:14.980
Great things in business are
never done by one person.

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:17.240
They're done by a
team of people."

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.920
So that's where I
want to end and would

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:22.460
happy to take questions for
the remainder of your time.

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:23.772
Yes, sir?

00:28:23.772 --> 00:28:27.700
AUDIENCE: Going back to the
beginning of your claim about

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:32.610
teams of 4 to 9 people
or 7 plus or minus 2,

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:35.556
you made an argument for why
that's the right team size,

00:28:35.556 --> 00:28:38.192
n (n - 1) /2, I think?

00:28:38.192 --> 00:28:40.650
RICHARD KARLGAARD: Yeah, 7 plus
or minus 2 is a good range.

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:44.568
AUDIENCE: Now, why are you
advocating for spontaneous team

00:28:44.568 --> 00:28:50.990
formation, more informal
teams, which you also said,

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:54.448
but I don't think you really
gave any particular reasons

00:28:54.448 --> 00:28:59.388
why we would prefer
that as opposed to more

00:28:59.388 --> 00:29:02.846
top-down management deciding
which projects would be on

00:29:02.846 --> 00:29:07.292
and trying to assign individuals
with complementary skillsets

00:29:07.292 --> 00:29:11.364
to different teams
as appropriate.

00:29:11.364 --> 00:29:12.780
RICHARD KARLGAARD:
In the book, we

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:15.760
go into this quite a bit in
the beginning of the book.

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:19.170
And it's a great question, which
is why we put it up upfront.

00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:21.700
And that's the importance
of maneuverability

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:23.030
in today's economy.

00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:25.940
Not just speed, but
maneuverability.

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:27.490
Speed can apply
that you're really

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:29.390
good going straight
ahead with a plan

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:31.270
and executing it like crazy.

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:33.120
Maneuverability is
what happens when

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.950
some new disruptor or
some new competitor

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:38.980
comes into your field, or
regulation changes, or laws

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:41.170
change, or whatever that is.

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:43.900
Sometimes, the
maneuverability means

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:46.570
you have to go sideways
or even backwards.

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:50.950
And our contention is-- I
use the example of Lenovo.

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:54.580
Lenovo, I was having dinner
with one of their executives.

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:56.940
Lenovo is $40 billion in size.

00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:00.050
Lenovo is the Chinese company
that bought the IBM PC

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:02.690
division about 10 years ago.

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:04.830
And they're a
pretty good company.

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:07.230
A lot of their North
American operations

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:09.860
are based in
Raleigh-Durham area.

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:11.990
Not a lot of people know that.

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:14.980
But they're a great company.

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:19.810
They hit on all cylinders.

00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:22.502
I guess, if Elon Musk
changes the world,

00:30:22.502 --> 00:30:23.960
then we're going
to have to come up

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:27.430
with a new metaphor
than cylinders.

00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:30.330
And this marketing,
the CMO of Lenovo

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:33.590
was talking about Xiaomi,
the Chinese company that

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:35.540
makes smartphones.

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:42.290
It's X-I-A-O-M-I, I believe
and how fast Xiaomi was moving,

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:46.290
and that Lenovo couldn't figure
out a way to move as fast

00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:47.740
as Xiaomi.

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:48.829
And I said, well, look.

00:30:48.829 --> 00:30:50.370
They're coming into
this marketplace.

00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:52.760
They're new.

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.260
Do you have a class
Innovator's Dilemma problem?

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:56.270
Is that your problem?

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:58.520
And the Innovator's
Dilemma problem

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:01.540
is that when you're an incumbent
and a new company comes

00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:04.670
in with a faster
moving technology that

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:07.620
is following the price curve
down and offering products

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:12.960
at a much lower price,
the Innovator's Dilemma

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:14.990
is what do you do?

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:17.555
Do you want to get into a
price war with guerrillas?

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:22.240
Rebel kind of guerrillas.

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.520
And that wasn't the problem.

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:25.150
The problem was pure speed.

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:28.180
He said Xiaomi was opening up
new markets in Chinese cities.

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:31.070
They're primarily in China
and elsewhere in Asia.

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:33.370
That's why a lot of
Americans know of them.

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:35.310
But they were just opening
up new marketplaces

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:38.725
faster than Lenovo could
even talk about it.

00:31:38.725 --> 00:31:40.100
Lenovo would have
these meetings,

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:44.380
how are we going to counter
Xiaomi in this city,

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:46.216
or that city, or that country?

00:31:46.216 --> 00:31:48.340
And they simply-- while
they were talking about it,

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:50.770
they would blink and
Xiaomi had already done it.

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:52.690
And so that, to me,
that was a wake up

00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:54.910
call that in this
economy, you have

00:31:54.910 --> 00:32:00.390
to have almost this immune
response, that organizations

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:02.980
almost have to be
considered alive,

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:04.730
and you have to have
this immune response.

00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:07.830
And the spontaneity is
a vital part of that.

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:15.860
Is Google going to leave its
strategy in mobile entirely up

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:17.304
to spontaneous teams?

00:32:17.304 --> 00:32:18.720
That's not what
I'm talking about.

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:22.180
I mean, I think there are these
big strategic initiatives,

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:24.090
and some projects
are always going

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:26.450
to call for large
numbers of people.

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:29.030
But on the day to
day battles, when

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:32.840
you see a problem or you see
an opportunity, if all of those

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:34.624
have to be discussed
and planned,

00:32:34.624 --> 00:32:36.540
then you just put gunk
inside the organization

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:38.935
and can't move fast enough.

00:32:38.935 --> 00:32:39.435
Yes?

00:32:39.435 --> 00:32:40.934
AUDIENCE: So
[INAUDIBLE] do you have

00:32:40.934 --> 00:32:43.796
any recommendations for
organizational policies

00:32:43.796 --> 00:32:46.994
or programs or
operating models for how

00:32:46.994 --> 00:32:51.176
to enable that to happen
[INAUDIBLE] that already

00:32:51.176 --> 00:32:54.640
has that pyramidal structure?

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:57.390
RICHARD KARLGAARD: Yeah,
there's an interesting model

00:32:57.390 --> 00:33:00.130
of Infosys.

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:03.810
Cloud computing
is the real threat

00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:07.180
to the Indian
outsourcing IT model.

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:08.850
And so what do you do?

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:12.480
Infosys is now being
led by a guy who was

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:15.870
the number two in R&amp;D at SAP.

00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:21.080
And his thought is that
Infosys has to go up market.

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.480
They're just going to get
automated out of existence.

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.730
The cloud is going
to take them out.

00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:27.210
Automation will take them out.

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:30.250
They have to go higher
added value work.

00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:31.410
How do you do that?

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:33.450
Because they were really
set up as this kind

00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:35.780
of IT factory model.

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:37.890
Throw as many bodies
against a problem

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:41.390
and get it done as you
could, and do it at a cost

00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:44.020
that American IT
companies couldn't match.

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:45.720
And so what he's
doing now is something

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:48.230
that was a project that
was initiated at SAP.

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:52.240
I don't know if it's being
followed now in his absence.

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:56.820
SAP has 60,000 employees,
20,000 developers.

00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:59.410
And that is to atomize
the developer teams

00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:03.750
into units of about 10 to
12 people without bosses.

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:06.340
It's a radical idea.

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:12.340
Or the bosses have a
very limited amount

00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:15.190
of time they're allowed to check
in on the progress of the team.

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:17.630
So these self-governing
teams is something

00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:20.112
that SAP is experimenting with.

00:34:20.112 --> 00:34:21.570
It's worth watching,
and it's worth

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:24.270
watching to see how Infosys
is going to do the same thing.

00:34:30.748 --> 00:34:32.498
AUDIENCE: Where do
organizations go wrong?

00:34:36.912 --> 00:34:39.370
RICHARD KARLGAARD: Organizations
go wrong in multiple ways.

00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:44.389
They go wrong when they are
fixated with their stock price

00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:46.960
and shareholder return.

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:49.079
This is what got
Ginni Rometty at IBM.

00:34:54.139 --> 00:34:57.730
The previous CEO of IBM, a guy
named Sam Palmisano, on his way

00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:00.540
out really stuck her
with a big problem

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:02.410
that she was too slow to see.

00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:05.047
And the problem was he had
promised Wall Street IBM's

00:35:05.047 --> 00:35:06.630
in such good shape
we're going to have

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:11.490
five years in a row
of earnings growth.

00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:15.970
Now the problem was is
that IBM's revenue was flat

00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:17.670
and even slightly down.

00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:19.940
So what do you do if
you've promised Wall Street

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:21.480
that you're going to have five
years in a row of earnings

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.190
growth, but your
revenue is down?

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:25.380
You have to steal
it from somewhere.

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:29.170
You have to steal it out
of R&amp;D. And where IBM stole

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:32.290
it was from the crown
jewel, by all appearances

00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:33.510
and all reporting.

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:35.750
And that is their
global services,

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:40.180
which is 2/3 of their $90
billion a year revenue.

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:44.190
And so the service quality
of IBM service clients

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:46.800
was rapidly going downhill,
thus opening up the door

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:51.840
for Tata, Infosys, even Dell
creeping into the service

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:54.300
business in a way.

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:57.950
And finally she saw
what was going on,

00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:01.150
and she called a halt to
it and told Wall Street

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:03.000
that it was a bad decision.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.750
We're not going to
stick to that decision,

00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:07.540
because we're eating
our seed corn.

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:11.250
We're starving our R&amp;D,
and we're not adequately

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:14.620
staffing our service
organization.

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:15.370
So that's one way.

00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:21.420
Another way is, as I said
in the book, companies

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:24.300
that toggle back and forth
and never quite figure out

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:26.345
what they are, who they
are, whether they're

00:36:26.345 --> 00:36:28.030
a meritocracy,
where they're more

00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:30.100
of a collaborative environment.

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:33.912
The CEO wakes up from
one day to another

00:36:33.912 --> 00:36:35.370
and can't decide
whether he's going

00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:38.480
to be tough in the manner
of Jeff Bezos, or Steve

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:41.380
Jobs, or Elon Musk,
or more nurturing

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:44.080
in the manner of others,
and goes back and forth,

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:45.070
leaves people confused.

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:48.230
Executive hypocrisy is
the surest, quickest way

00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:50.565
to kill the culture
of an organization

00:36:50.565 --> 00:36:52.060
and wreck the organization.

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:54.590
That's when the executive
is asking things

00:36:54.590 --> 00:37:01.380
that he or she would not do
personally-- not work as hard,

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:05.880
not to abide by travel expense
limitations, and so forth.

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:06.840
That's a killer.

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:09.850
I once remember
I spent five days

00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:12.540
on the road with Bill
Gates in the early '90s

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:15.760
when he was at the
peak of his game.

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:18.620
And I said, why are we flying
around in coach, by the way?

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:20.930
Because this is a
multi-city tour.

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:23.570
And Bill Gates, even
then, it was '93.

00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:27.010
Bill Gates, even then, was
worth $6 or $8 billion.

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:32.000
And he said, if I don't
do it, nobody will do it.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.700
And so we fly coach.

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:36.350
You can upgrade on
your own nickel.

00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:38.750
We stay at Hilton level hotels.

00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:41.110
If you want to stay at
a more expensive hotel,

00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:42.960
do it on your own nickel.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:46.820
And we rent Ford Taurus or
Toyota Camry level cars.

00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:49.490
If you want to have more,
you do it on your own nickel.

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:51.465
So I have this
wonderful picture where

00:37:51.465 --> 00:37:57.650
he's sitting in row 27 in a
late night flight from Boston

00:37:57.650 --> 00:38:03.200
to LaGuardia, working on
his Compaq 496 laptop.

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:07.854
Yes?

00:38:07.854 --> 00:38:10.314
AUDIENCE: So I have
[INAUDIBLE] in New York,

00:38:10.314 --> 00:38:12.282
and they're doing
some great work.

00:38:12.282 --> 00:38:16.218
They're really innovative,
and that trust is there.

00:38:16.218 --> 00:38:19.170
And they're doing
some fantastic work.

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:23.324
Our counterparts in Sunnyvale,
head office is looking to us

00:38:23.324 --> 00:38:25.148
and they're like,
how is this possible?

00:38:25.148 --> 00:38:26.520
What are you doing?

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:29.318
How are we able to feed
that back and learn

00:38:29.318 --> 00:38:32.234
to manage at the scale
that they're dealing with?

00:38:32.234 --> 00:38:33.640
RICHARD KARLGAARD: I don't know.

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:39.520
Lana was telling me coming in
that Google had been engaged

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:42.800
in three years of research on
team efficacy, and dynamics,

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.950
and trust, and all
of those things.

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:47.090
I'll be really eager
to see the research.

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:51.030
I can tell you that the
primary motivation is this.

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:52.970
Execution is so
important in a company--

00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:56.500
doing things faster, cheaper,
using data and analytics,

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:59.510
optimizing your supply
chain, being efficient

00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:00.600
with your use of capital.

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:02.440
All of those are in
the camp of what you

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:05.320
call continual marginal gains.

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:06.470
They're measurable.

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:10.120
You're always trying to improve
them-- always, always, always.

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:12.390
The side of corporate
culture, particularly trust,

00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:14.820
is the side of
transformational gains.

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:21.140
Now, what percentage of
people's brain power,

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:24.440
and efforts, and passions do you
think the average Googler puts

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:25.800
into their job?

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:26.790
It's not 100%.

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:27.970
Nobody puts in 100%.

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:30.900
Maybe a founder of a
company puts in 100%.

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:35.760
But for most of us, it's 50,
60, 70-- something like that.

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:39.950
What if you could move the
average commitment and passion

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:42.660
of people from just
10 percentage points,

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:48.550
if you could get somebody from
60 to 70 multiplied by 55,000?

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:50.140
The only way that
people are going

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:54.072
to do that, that are not the
founders, that don't have stock

00:39:54.072 --> 00:39:55.530
options that are
going to make them

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:58.240
a billionaire, that
are working hard,

00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:01.300
that are working for a fair
salary but not a particularly

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:02.930
great salary?

00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:04.840
The only way that people
are going to do that

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:10.660
is if they fundamentally trust
the organization and the people

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:12.260
who lead the organization.

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:16.700
And they fundamentally
trust it in an ethical way,

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:19.360
that this company is
doing the right thing.

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:22.550
This is something where I
can put my big passions into

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:24.300
and I will not regret it.

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:25.780
And that is huge.

00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:28.470
And it's so underestimated.

00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:30.535
Is that my phone?

00:40:30.535 --> 00:40:35.700
It's talked about a lot
inside of organizations,

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:39.810
but rarely do
organizations do it.

00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:43.200
When I was reading Laszlo
Bock's book "Work Rules."

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:43.950
Geez.

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:46.116
You'd think I'd have a limit
on the number of rings.

00:40:46.116 --> 00:40:51.410
It's going to-- there you go.

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:54.860
I think that he's really
on to that in a big way.

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:56.820
And I think where Google
has the opportunity

00:40:56.820 --> 00:41:00.160
is to be the leading company
to come up with analytics

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:00.990
that support that.

00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:05.300
We have science and data
on individuals going back

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:08.620
to Myers-Briggs and
everything that has followed.

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:13.590
We have HR IT companies like
Workday, Success Factors, which

00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:16.340
was bought by SAP, and others.

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:19.910
I have not yet seen the
highly analytical approach

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:21.820
to what is it that
creates teams.

00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:23.570
We know the science.

00:41:23.570 --> 00:41:25.910
The science that you can
get from anthropology,

00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:27.840
neuroscience, and
so on and so forth,

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:30.640
into which we go into
great detail in the book.

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:33.349
But the data is still emergent.

00:41:33.349 --> 00:41:35.640
And I think that companies
like Google that figure that

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:39.530
out and figure out how
you quantify trust,

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:41.424
and can you watch
trust go up and down,

00:41:41.424 --> 00:41:43.590
and what are the things you
can do to facilitate it?

00:41:43.590 --> 00:41:46.300
What impact does it have
on individuals and teams?

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:48.800
It's going to be huge.

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:52.409
Somebody's going to create
the Salesforce of that.

00:41:52.409 --> 00:41:54.450
You're either going to do
it internally at Google

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:56.445
and spin it out, or
somebody will do it.

00:41:56.445 --> 00:41:58.320
I think we're on the
verge of that happening.

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:02.230
Time for one more.

00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:07.803
Yes?

00:42:07.803 --> 00:42:09.428
AUDIENCE: How would
you get Wall Street

00:42:09.428 --> 00:42:14.409
investors to get on board with
understanding [INAUDIBLE]?

00:42:14.409 --> 00:42:16.450
RICHARD KARLGAARD: Well,
that's a great question.

00:42:16.450 --> 00:42:19.910
How do you get Wall Street-- if
quarterly reports and managing

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:23.660
for shareholder profitability
can be poison to a company,

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:29.070
as it was for General
Motors, as it was for IBM

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:32.680
and many, many others-- Dell.

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:34.140
You can go private.

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:34.660
That helps.

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:36.160
Dell has done that.

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.470
You can have a different
kind of ownership and voting

00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:39.120
structures.

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:39.910
Google has.

00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:41.550
I think that was a
stroke of genius.

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:45.510
It certainly hasn't hurt
Google's market cap.

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:49.300
I think that founders, founder
CEOs have a really powerful

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:52.740
advantage in the marketplace
here in that they can tell Wall

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:57.530
Street to go stuff it in a way
that a hired gun CEO can't.

00:42:57.530 --> 00:43:00.140
I once talked to a
CEO about this problem

00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:01.280
who wasn't a founder.

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:02.840
And I said, how do you do this?

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:04.660
He said you sandbag.

00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:06.840
He said I have to
lie to the street.

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:09.720
He said, if I think we can
have 12% growth this year

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:12.970
and 15% profit growth,
I'm certainly not going

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:14.550
to tell that to the street.

00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:16.890
I'm going to tell them
maybe 2/3 of that,

00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:22.680
and I'm going to take
that money and make sure

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:26.180
that we're continually investing
in the culture of this company.

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:32.140
So some hired gun
CEOs can do that.

00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:35.380
Alan Mulally did that at Ford.

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:38.820
But Alan Mulally was one of
those rare CEOs who is not

00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:42.910
a founder, who exuded
this kind of moral quality

00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:46.570
and ethical quality
that people got behind.

00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:50.070
There's this great story
when he came into Ford.

00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:53.610
And Ford was losing
money, and he was meeting

00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:54.640
with his direct reports.

00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:58.030
And they had yellow,
red, and green cards.

00:43:58.030 --> 00:43:59.970
And they were supposed
to hold up the cards

00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:02.860
to signal how their
own divisions were

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:04.530
doing inside the company.

00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:06.570
And everybody held up green.

00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:10.030
And he just-- he had a meltdown.

00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:13.530
A useful meltdown, in
fact, with colorful words

00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:16.280
emanating out of his mouth.

00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:20.530
How in the heck can you be
all showing green cards when

00:44:20.530 --> 00:44:22.640
this company is losing money?

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:25.570
He says, from now on, we
speak the truth around here,

00:44:25.570 --> 00:44:27.065
and I'm not going to fire you.

00:44:27.065 --> 00:44:30.890
At least the first time if you
tell me you have a problem.

00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:35.660
And the first person to do that
was a guy named Mark Fields.

00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:37.220
He said, OK.

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:38.950
Things really suck for us.

00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:39.610
Here's why.

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:42.220
Here's the kind of help I
need in the organization.

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:45.120
And today, Mark
Fields is the CEO.

00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:50.090
So I think when an
outsider CEO comes in,

00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:56.720
they have to very early
set that tone of honesty

00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:58.740
and accountability,
and do it in a way

00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:00.660
where people are
held accountable

00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:03.430
but they're not shot
for being honest.

00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:05.210
That will wreck
companies very fast

00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:07.782
if you're the opposite of that.

00:45:07.782 --> 00:45:08.990
We're at the end of our time.

00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:13.300
I want to thank you for
coming, for your attention.

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:20.910
There are aggressively priced
books in the back for $10.

00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:22.800
If you're Amazon Prime,
it'll cost you $15.

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:25.410
If you're not Prime, it'll
cost you more than that.

00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:27.860
And at the bookstore,
it'll cost you $30.

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:30.890
So if you want, they're there.

00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:35.235
And it's really a thrill
to be here and see.

00:45:35.235 --> 00:45:37.110
This is my first time
at the New York office.

00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:42.280
I've been in the Mountain
View office complex and campus

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:42.930
many times.

00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:44.500
So thank you very much.

00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:47.250
