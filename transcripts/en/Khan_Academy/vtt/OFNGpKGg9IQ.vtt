00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.780
Now let's do a really
interesting problem.

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.290
So I have y equals x,
and y is equal to x

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.840
squared minus 2x
right over here.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.530
And we're going to
rotate the region

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.020
in between these two functions.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.277
So that's this region
right over here.

00:00:13.277 --> 00:00:15.610
And we're not going to rotate
it just around the x-axis,

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.360
we're going to rotate it around
the horizontal line y equals 4.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.454
So we're going to
rotate it around this.

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:23.870
And if we do that, we'll get
a shape that looks like this.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.550
I drew it ahead of time, just
so I could draw it nicely.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.210
And as you can see, it looks
like some type of a vase

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.060
with a hole at the bottom.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.520
And so what we're going to do
is attempt to do this using,

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.395
I guess you'd call it
the washer method which

00:00:36.395 --> 00:00:37.800
is a variant of the disk method.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.790
So let's construct a washer.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.350
So let's look at a given x.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.520
So let's say an x
right over here.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.750
So let's say that we're
at an x right over there.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:48.370
And what we're
going to do is we're

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.160
going to rotate this region.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.090
We're going to give
it some depth, dx.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.010
So that is dx.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.120
We're going to rotate
this around the line y

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.840
is equal to 4.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.580
So if you were to visualize it
over here, you have some depth.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.472
And when you rotate it
around, the inner radius

00:01:05.472 --> 00:01:07.680
is going to look like the
inner radius of our washer.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.440
It's going to look
something like that.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.900
And then the outer
radius of our washer

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.420
is going to contour
around x squared minus 2x.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.780
So it's going to
look something--

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.703
my best attempt
to draw it-- it's

00:01:23.703 --> 00:01:25.440
going to look
something like that.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.810
And of course, our washer
is going to have some depth.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.250
So let me draw the depth.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.950
So it's going to
have some depth, dx.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.940
So this is my best attempt at
drawing some of that the depth.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.970
So this is the
depth of our washer.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.440
And then just to make the face
of the washer a little bit

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.230
clearer, let me do it
in this green color.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.440
So the face of the
washer is going

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.310
to be all of this business.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.060
All of this business is going
to be the face of our washer.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.350
So if we can figure
out the volume of one

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.210
of these washers for a
given x, then we just

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.240
have to sum up all of
the washers for all

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.919
of the x's in our interval.

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:07.710
So let's see if we can
set up the integral,

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.990
and maybe in the
next video we'll

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.820
just forge ahead and actually
evaluate the integral.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.964
So let's think about the
volume of the washer.

00:02:15.964 --> 00:02:17.630
To think about the
volume of the washer,

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.580
we really just have to
think about the area

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.510
of the face of the washer.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.510
So area of "face"--
put face in quotes--

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.380
is going to be equal to what?

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.670
Well, it would be the
area of the washer--

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.880
if it wasn't a washer,
if it was just a coin--

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.441
and then subtract out
the area of the part

00:02:35.441 --> 00:02:36.440
that you're cutting out.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.890
So the area of the
washer if it didn't

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.750
have a hole in the
middle would just

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.285
be pi times the
outer radius squared.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.090
It would be pi times
this radius squared,

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.950
that we could call
the outer radius.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.320
And since it's a washer,
we need to subtract out

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.030
the area of this inner circle.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:05.500
So minus pi times
inner radius squared.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.000
So we really just
have to figure out

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.160
what the outer and inner radius,
or radii I should say, are.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.710
So let's think about it.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:19.971
So our outer radius is
going to be equal to what?

00:03:19.971 --> 00:03:21.470
Well, we can visualize
it over here.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.610
This is our outer
radius, which is also

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.770
going to be equal to
that right over there.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.720
So that's the distance
between y equals

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.440
4 and the function that's
defining our outside.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.520
So this is essentially,
this height right over here,

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.280
is going to be equal to 4
minus x squared minus 2x.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.000
I'm just finding the distance
or the height between these two

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.900
functions.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.140
So the outer radius is
going to be 4 minus this,

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.100
minus x squared minus
2x, which is just 4

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.520
minus x squared plus 2x.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.850
Now, what is the inner radius?

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.830
What is that going to be?

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.550
Well, that's just going to
be this distance between y

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.480
equals 4 and y equals x.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.265
So it's just going
to be 4 minus x.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.810
So if we wanted to find
the area of the face of one

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.090
of these washers for a
given x, it's going to be--

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.290
and we can factor
out this pi-- it's

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.680
going to be pi times the
outer radius squared,

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.540
which is all of this
business squared.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.830
So it's going to be 4 minus
x squared plus 2x squared

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.280
minus pi times
the inner radius--

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.780
although we factored
out the pi-- so

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.810
minus the inner radius squared.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.800
So minus 4 minus x squared.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.650
So this will give us
the area of the surface

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.280
or the face of one
of these washers.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.700
If we want the volume of
one of those watchers,

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.040
we then just have to
multiply times the depth, dx.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.800
And then if we want to actually
find the volume of this entire

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.250
figure, then we just have to
sum up all of these washers

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.950
for each of our x's.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:16.830
So let's do that.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.050
So we're going to sum
up the washers for each

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.300
of our x's and take the
limit as they approach zero,

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.490
but we have to make sure
we got our interval right.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.260
So what are these-- we care
about the entire region

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.840
between the points
where they intersect.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.620
So let's make sure
we get our interval.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.203
So to figure out our
interval, we just

00:05:32.203 --> 00:05:36.070
say when does y equal
x intersect y equal

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.350
x squared minus 2x?

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.630
Let me do this in
a different color.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.150
We just have to
think about when does

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.245
x equal x squared minus 2x.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.420
When are our two functions
equal to each other?

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.030
Which is equivalent
to-- if we just

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:58.800
subtract x from
both sides, we get

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.190
when does x squared
minus 3x equal 0.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.260
We can factor out an x
on the right hand side.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.530
So this is going to be when does
x times x minus 3 equal zero.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.310
Well, if the product is equal
to 0, at least one of these

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.350
need to be equal to 0.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:18.380
So x could be equal to 0,
or x minus 3 is equal to 0.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.280
So x is equal to 0
or x is equal to 3.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.010
So this is x is 0, and
this right over here

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:25.850
is x is equal to 3.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.100
So that gives us our interval.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.120
We're going to go
from x equals 0

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.850
to x equals 3 to get our volume.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.000
In the next video,
we'll actually

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.320
evaluate this integral.
