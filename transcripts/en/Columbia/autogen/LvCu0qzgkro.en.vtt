so today we're going to be learning how

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090
so today we're going to be learning how
 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.940
so today we're going to be learning how
to make a name plate or design a flame

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950
to make a name plate or design a flame
 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.849
to make a name plate or design a flame
plate using master cam so when you first

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859
plate using master cam so when you first
 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.129
plate using master cam so when you first
open the software this is the screen

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139
open the software this is the screen
 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.940
open the software this is the screen
that you will be seeing the name plate

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950
that you will be seeing the name plate
 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.490
that you will be seeing the name plate
is six inches by two and a half inches

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500
is six inches by two and a half inches
 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:25.630
is six inches by two and a half inches
by half an inch

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640
 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.210
create the nameplate using lines let's

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220
create the nameplate using lines let's
 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.740
create the nameplate using lines let's
start at zero zero and here this is the

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750
start at zero zero and here this is the
 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.200
start at zero zero and here this is the
length so let's put input the length of

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210
length so let's put input the length of
 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.740
length so let's put input the length of
six and we'll keep it horizontal so

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750
six and we'll keep it horizontal so
 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.760
six and we'll keep it horizontal so
there we go by

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770
 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:54.090
two and a half

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100
 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:01.049
which is so input 2.5 enter and we'll

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059
which is so input 2.5 enter and we'll
 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:09.840
which is so input 2.5 enter and we'll
click the vertical tab

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850
 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.300
you

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310
 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.190
and then again with the unclick the

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200
and then again with the unclick the
 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:30.310
and then again with the unclick the
vertical six and

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320
 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.550
we closed it off and we're good to go so

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560
we closed it off and we're good to go so
 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.300
we closed it off and we're good to go so
I like making the the image of the

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310
I like making the the image of the
 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.560
I like making the the image of the
nameplate prior so I can get an idea of

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570
nameplate prior so I can get an idea of
 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.000
nameplate prior so I can get an idea of
the area that I should be working in

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010
 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.180
so in mastercam you can create a bunch

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190
so in mastercam you can create a bunch
 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.790
so in mastercam you can create a bunch
of different lines line segments arcs

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800
of different lines line segments arcs
 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.520
of different lines line segments arcs
circles what we should first work on is

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530
circles what we should first work on is
 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.600
circles what we should first work on is
the outside the contour of the nameplate

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610
the outside the contour of the nameplate
 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.080
the outside the contour of the nameplate
now you can have a basic contour like a

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090
now you can have a basic contour like a
 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.680
now you can have a basic contour like a
basic square contour you can make a

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690
basic square contour you can make a
 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.470
basic square contour you can make a
ellipsoid contour or a circular contour

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480
ellipsoid contour or a circular contour
 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.890
ellipsoid contour or a circular contour
or pretty much any shape that you want

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900
or pretty much any shape that you want
 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.660
or pretty much any shape that you want
for me I'm just going to make a basic

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670
for me I'm just going to make a basic
 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.000
for me I'm just going to make a basic
ellipse so I'm going to select the base

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010
ellipse so I'm going to select the base
 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.390
ellipse so I'm going to select the base
point I want to start at the center

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400
point I want to start at the center
 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:39.000
point I want to start at the center
which is three inches in by 1.25 and

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010
 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.190
that as you can see in the circle here

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200
that as you can see in the circle here
 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:51.670
that as you can see in the circle here
and I will have this be

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680
 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.480
three inches

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490
 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:03.910
and the height be

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920
 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.070
so the ellipse barely touches the sides

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080
so the ellipse barely touches the sides
 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:17.110
so the ellipse barely touches the sides
of the nameplate and I want to make an

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120
of the nameplate and I want to make an
 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.320
of the nameplate and I want to make an
inner ellipse because I want to give the

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330
inner ellipse because I want to give the
 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:32.070
inner ellipse because I want to give the
surface another contour

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080
 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.290
we're going to create another ellipse

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300
 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:46.670
at the center so three enter 0.25

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680
 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:54.289
and this time we are going to go to two

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299
and this time we are going to go to two
 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.010
and this time we are going to go to two
point

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020
point
 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:04.660
point
9 and with and

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670
 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.440
1.15 and height

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450
1.15 and height
 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.660
1.15 and height
and as all so I'll make a basic

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670
and as all so I'll make a basic
 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:31.170
and as all so I'll make a basic
nameplate with the words name is Earl

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180
nameplate with the words name is Earl
 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.480
nameplate with the words name is Earl
and you can put it horizontally or

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490
and you can put it horizontally or
 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.020
and you can put it horizontally or
vertically or at the top or bottom of an

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030
vertically or at the top or bottom of an
 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.820
vertically or at the top or bottom of an
arc you can also put at the top of a

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830
arc you can also put at the top of a
 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.450
arc you can also put at the top of a
chain a chain is pretty much a line or a

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460
chain a chain is pretty much a line or a
 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.159
chain a chain is pretty much a line or a
closed line what I will do is I will

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169
closed line what I will do is I will
 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:57.700
closed line what I will do is I will
keep it horizontal also I will press

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710
keep it horizontal also I will press
 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.930
keep it horizontal also I will press
ENTER here try to put that in the center

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940
ENTER here try to put that in the center
 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.909
ENTER here try to put that in the center
and you can click the area that you want

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919
and you can click the area that you want
 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.520
and you can click the area that you want
it in now this is too big so what we

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530
it in now this is too big so what we
 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.150
it in now this is too big so what we
could do is press escape and we return

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160
could do is press escape and we return
 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.110
could do is press escape and we return
we undo and you can change the size and

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120
we undo and you can change the size and
 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.990
we undo and you can change the size and
the spacing of the lettering so what I

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000
the spacing of the lettering so what I
 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:28.420
the spacing of the lettering so what I
will do is change the size to 0.5 the

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430
will do is change the size to 0.5 the
 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.610
will do is change the size to 0.5 the
spacing changes automatically go back in

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620
spacing changes automatically go back in
 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.830
spacing changes automatically go back in
and there you go um let's back out

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840
and there you go um let's back out
 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:48.390
and there you go um let's back out
create letters check and adjust and

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400
create letters check and adjust and
 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.580
create letters check and adjust and
unfortunately master Kim there are some

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590
unfortunately master Kim there are some
 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.930
unfortunately master Kim there are some
things in master Kim that are not as

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940
things in master Kim that are not as
 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.520
things in master Kim that are not as
advanced that you actually have to go

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:57.530
advanced that you actually have to go
 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.200
advanced that you actually have to go
back and it's pretty much trial and

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210
back and it's pretty much trial and
 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:07.129
back and it's pretty much trial and
error

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:07.139
 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:11.009
now what you can do is also you can

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:11.019
now what you can do is also you can
 

00:06:11.019 --> 00:06:18.860
now what you can do is also you can
create circles

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870
 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.260
um

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270
 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:29.480
lines as I said before

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.490
 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.440
um you can create parallel lines so this

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:34.450
um you can create parallel lines so this
 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:39.150
um you can create parallel lines so this
line and there we go

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.160
line and there we go
 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:07:06.879
line and there we go
um you can create curves

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:06.889
 

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:12.379
there are splines and so on so you can

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:12.389
there are splines and so on so you can
 

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:16.719
there are splines and so on so you can
use these to create artwork if you want

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:16.729
use these to create artwork if you want
 

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:19.939
use these to create artwork if you want
so now let's say this is pretty much

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:19.949
so now let's say this is pretty much
 

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:21.949
so now let's say this is pretty much
you're pretty much done with creating

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:21.959
you're pretty much done with creating
 

00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:27.889
you're pretty much done with creating
your basic nameplate what we want to

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:27.899
your basic nameplate what we want to
 

00:07:27.899 --> 00:07:29.209
your basic nameplate what we want to
start doing now is creating the tool

00:07:29.209 --> 00:07:29.219
start doing now is creating the tool
 

00:07:29.219 --> 00:07:32.659
start doing now is creating the tool
paths so what we start with is the

00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:32.669
paths so what we start with is the
 

00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:38.929
paths so what we start with is the
contour

00:07:38.929 --> 00:07:38.939
 

00:07:38.939 --> 00:07:43.800
and we have to pick a chain as I said a

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:43.810
and we have to pick a chain as I said a
 

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:47.010
and we have to pick a chain as I said a
chain is a closed line so we'll click

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:47.020
chain is a closed line so we'll click
 

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:53.309
chain is a closed line so we'll click
this chain and I'll click OK now there

00:07:53.309 --> 00:07:53.319
this chain and I'll click OK now there
 

00:07:53.319 --> 00:07:54.869
this chain and I'll click OK now there
will be a set of tools that we will

00:07:54.869 --> 00:07:54.879
will be a set of tools that we will
 

00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:58.589
will be a set of tools that we will
assign you um it'll probably consist of

00:07:58.589 --> 00:07:58.599
assign you um it'll probably consist of
 

00:07:58.599 --> 00:08:02.879
assign you um it'll probably consist of
a an end mill a ball and mill an

00:08:02.879 --> 00:08:02.889
a an end mill a ball and mill an
 

00:08:02.889 --> 00:08:08.040
a an end mill a ball and mill an
engraving tool of some sort so we this

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:08.050
engraving tool of some sort so we this
 

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:09.600
engraving tool of some sort so we this
is the tool path when we open the tool

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:09.610
is the tool path when we open the tool
 

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:11.969
is the tool path when we open the tool
path we'll click on the contour the tool

00:08:11.969 --> 00:08:11.979
path we'll click on the contour the tool
 

00:08:11.979 --> 00:08:14.490
path we'll click on the contour the tool
you can select it from the library first

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:14.500
you can select it from the library first
 

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.850
you can select it from the library first
we'll select filter and we'll click on

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:17.860
we'll select filter and we'll click on
 

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.610
we'll select filter and we'll click on
the end mill and I'll click the ball and

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:20.620
the end mill and I'll click the ball and
 

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:27.809
the end mill and I'll click the ball and
mill era and click OK and we'll select

00:08:27.809 --> 00:08:27.819
mill era and click OK and we'll select
 

00:08:27.819 --> 00:08:32.370
mill era and click OK and we'll select
it from the tool library and here gives

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:32.380
it from the tool library and here gives
 

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.980
it from the tool library and here gives
us a list of flat end mills that we can

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:34.990
us a list of flat end mills that we can
 

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:37.259
us a list of flat end mills that we can
choose from now for this we can choose

00:08:37.259 --> 00:08:37.269
choose from now for this we can choose
 

00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:43.730
choose from now for this we can choose
the 1/4 or actually 1/2 flat end mill

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:43.740
 

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:51.809
and then we will do the cut parameters

00:08:51.809 --> 00:08:51.819
 

00:08:51.819 --> 00:08:54.189
so these are the cut parameters these

00:08:54.189 --> 00:08:54.199
so these are the cut parameters these
 

00:08:54.199 --> 00:08:56.619
so these are the cut parameters these
are pretty much options for how the tool

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:56.629
are pretty much options for how the tool
 

00:08:56.629 --> 00:09:01.119
are pretty much options for how the tool
is going to cut the piece the

00:09:01.119 --> 00:09:01.129
is going to cut the piece the
 

00:09:01.129 --> 00:09:05.259
is going to cut the piece the
compensation the direction the depth of

00:09:05.259 --> 00:09:05.269
compensation the direction the depth of
 

00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:07.449

breakthrough if you're going to drill a
 

00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:17.350
breakthrough if you're going to drill a
hole um how many passes you're going to

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:17.360
hole um how many passes you're going to
 

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:21.670
hole um how many passes you're going to
take to get to the final cut and the

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:21.680
take to get to the final cut and the
 

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.670
take to get to the final cut and the
linking parameters which are how the

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:24.680
linking parameters which are how the
 

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.069
linking parameters which are how the
tool itself is going to cut into the

tool itself is going to cut into the
 

00:09:27.079 --> 00:09:32.650
tool itself is going to cut into the
piece how deep it's going to go so let's

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:32.660
piece how deep it's going to go so let's
 

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.920
piece how deep it's going to go so let's
start with depth cut we want to make the

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:35.930
start with depth cut we want to make the
 

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:39.850
start with depth cut we want to make the
max rough step which is how the how deep

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:39.860
max rough step which is how the how deep
 

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:41.829
max rough step which is how the how deep
the piece is going to go or how keep the

tool is going to go with every step

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:44.110
tool is going to go with every step
 

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:49.960
tool is going to go with every step
we'll make that a tenth of an inch with

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:49.970
we'll make that a tenth of an inch with
 

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:58.360
we'll make that a tenth of an inch with
a finishing step of half of that this is

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:58.370
a finishing step of half of that this is
 

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:00.910
a finishing step of half of that this is
the entry and exit we'll see how that

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:00.920

is 0.5 inches so we will make this 0.5

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:21.210
is 0.5 inches so we will make this 0.5
 

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:29.830
is 0.5 inches so we will make this 0.5
and that will be absolute check this and

and that will be absolute check this and
 

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:35.780
and that will be absolute check this and
it is now inside so this is the tool

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:35.790
it is now inside so this is the tool
 

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:39.650
it is now inside so this is the tool

from the outside so we will do is we
 

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:49.160
from the outside so we will do is we
will click on parameters and we will go

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:49.170
will click on parameters and we will go
 

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.200
will click on parameters and we will go
to cut parameters and we'll let that be

to cut parameters and we'll let that be
 

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:55.820
to cut parameters and we'll let that be
right and check and this is the

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:55.830
right and check and this is the

piece what I forgot was to put the
 

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:01.710
piece what I forgot was to put the
negative sign here because we will be

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:01.720
negative sign here because we will be
 

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.380

cutting down into the negative Z

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:04.390
cutting down into the negative Z
 

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:08.130
cutting down into the negative Z
direction so again we will regenerate as

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:08.140
direction so again we will regenerate as
 

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:12.170

you can see it'll be more than one path

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:12.180
you can see it'll be more than one path
 

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:24.550
you can see it'll be more than one path
and we verify and there we are

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:24.560
 

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:29.370
can fast-forward

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:29.380
 

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:33.150
now we did go 0.5 into the into the

now we did go 0.5 into the into the
 

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.160
now we did go 0.5 into the into the
piece or 0.5 in the negative Z direction

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:35.170
piece or 0.5 in the negative Z direction

but we didn't set the stock and
 

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.600
but we didn't set the stock and
therefore mastercam generates stock for

00:14:27.699 --> 00:14:27.709
ball end mil and we go to the tool
 

00:14:27.709 --> 00:14:31.389
ball end mil and we go to the tool
library and we will use a quarter inch

00:14:31.389 --> 00:14:31.399
library and we will use a quarter inch
 

00:14:31.399 --> 00:14:41.290
library and we will use a quarter inch
ball and mill so let me go straight to

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:41.300
ball and mill so let me go straight to
 

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:44.939
ball and mill so let me go straight to
linking parameters and we will select

00:14:44.939 --> 00:14:44.949
linking parameters and we will select
 

00:14:44.949 --> 00:14:50.499
linking parameters and we will select
depth of a tenth of an inch negative

00:14:50.499 --> 00:14:50.509
depth of a tenth of an inch negative
 

00:14:50.509 --> 00:14:56.980
depth of a tenth of an inch negative
direction and there we go we can verify

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:56.990
direction and there we go we can verify
 

00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:06.720
direction and there we go we can verify
that by going up here regenerating and

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:06.730
 

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:10.120
play

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:10.130
 

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:16.120
now this will give us the entire two

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:16.130
now this will give us the entire two
 

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:24.560
now this will give us the entire two
paths both two paths

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:24.570
 

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:27.390
and we could fast-forward

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:27.400
and we could fast-forward
 

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:31.650
and we could fast-forward
and this is what I did with the ball and

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:31.660
and this is what I did with the ball and
 

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:36.390
and this is what I did with the ball and
mill so now it's time to do the

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:36.400
mill so now it's time to do the
 

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.060
mill so now it's time to do the
engraving there are several methods for

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:39.070
engraving there are several methods for
 

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:43.470
engraving there are several methods for
creating the engraving the best method

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:43.480
creating the engraving the best method
 

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.150
creating the engraving the best method
or the easiest method is to create a

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:45.160
or the easiest method is to create a
 

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.450
or the easiest method is to create a
basic contour again with an offset of

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:48.460
basic contour again with an offset of
 

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:53.700
basic contour again with an offset of
zero so it now is asking us to pick the

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:53.710
zero so it now is asking us to pick the
 

00:15:53.710 --> 00:16:01.500
zero so it now is asking us to pick the
chains so we select all the change when

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:01.510
chains so we select all the change when
 

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:03.510
chains so we select all the change when
it says that pretty much you just have

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:03.520
it says that pretty much you just have
 

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:09.150
it says that pretty much you just have
to end the the contour chain that you're

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:09.160
to end the the contour chain that you're
 

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:14.630
to end the the contour chain that you're
at and just select the next one and

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:14.640
at and just select the next one and
 

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.160
at and just select the next one and
that's because it's asking for a branch

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:17.170
that's because it's asking for a branch
 

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:20.610
that's because it's asking for a branch
point and a branch points basically an

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:20.620
point and a branch points basically an
 

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:26.280
point and a branch points basically an
area where the line moves or or the line

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:26.290
area where the line moves or or the line
 

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:27.600
area where the line moves or or the line
ends and another one begins

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:27.610
ends and another one begins
 

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:30.150
ends and another one begins
so here the branch point was for this

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:30.160
so here the branch point was for this
 

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.850
so here the branch point was for this
line was this line so we can end that

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:32.860
line was this line so we can end that
 

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:38.310
line was this line so we can end that
there are no other branch points and in

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:38.320
there are no other branch points and in
 

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:46.319
there are no other branch points and in
this

00:16:46.319 --> 00:16:46.329
 

00:16:46.329 --> 00:17:06.159
you

00:17:06.159 --> 00:17:06.169
 

00:17:06.169 --> 00:17:08.470
all right

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:08.480
all right
 

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:12.789
all right
now again it's a contour we haven't

00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:12.799
now again it's a contour we haven't
 

00:17:12.799 --> 00:17:15.159
now again it's a contour we haven't
decided which tool we're we're going

00:17:15.159 --> 00:17:15.169
decided which tool we're we're going
 

00:17:15.169 --> 00:17:19.390
decided which tool we're we're going
which engraver we're going to use during

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:19.400
which engraver we're going to use during
 

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.360
which engraver we're going to use during
the semester so for now we're going to

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:22.370
the semester so for now we're going to
 

00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:30.090
the semester so for now we're going to
use a 1/16 ball and mill on that and

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:30.100
use a 1/16 ball and mill on that and
 

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.830
use a 1/16 ball and mill on that and
we're going to set the diameter offset

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:32.840
we're going to set the diameter offset
 

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:41.080
we're going to set the diameter offset
to zero we will turn all compensation

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:41.090
to zero we will turn all compensation
 

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:49.990
to zero we will turn all compensation
off and we can go straight to linking

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.000
off and we can go straight to linking
 

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.780
off and we can go straight to linking
parameter and we'll say that the depth

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:52.790
parameter and we'll say that the depth
 

00:17:52.790 --> 00:18:00.550
parameter and we'll say that the depth
is 1/2 tenth of an inch

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:00.560
 

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:08.040
so please ero five-

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:08.050
 

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:11.580
and that is all

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:11.590
 

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:17.180
now we can verify all this turn rate and

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:17.190
now we can verify all this turn rate and
 

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:35.289
now we can verify all this turn rate and
up here their file this

00:18:35.289 --> 00:18:35.299
 

00:18:35.299 --> 00:18:40.310
fast forward

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320
 

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.620
um once and all you'll get funky things

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:43.630
um once and all you'll get funky things
 

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:45.990
um once and all you'll get funky things
like this so you'll go back and all you

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.000
like this so you'll go back and all you
 

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.880
like this so you'll go back and all you
have to do have to do is just change the

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:47.890
have to do have to do is just change the
 

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:51.000
have to do have to do is just change the
parameters here we left the lead in lead

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:51.010
parameters here we left the lead in lead
 

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:54.300
parameters here we left the lead in lead
out checked we uncheck that and I

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:54.310
out checked we uncheck that and I
 

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:56.100
out checked we uncheck that and I
believe the tool that we used was also

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:56.110
believe the tool that we used was also
 

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:59.460
believe the tool that we used was also
too large so we can reselect the tool

00:18:59.460 --> 00:18:59.470
too large so we can reselect the tool
 

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:03.680
too large so we can reselect the tool
from the tool library

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:03.690
 

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:08.640
let's regenerate and let's see where

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:08.650
let's regenerate and let's see where
 

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:12.440
let's regenerate and let's see where
that gets us

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:12.450
 

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:19.620
fine

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:19.630
 

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:23.410
so whenever we find areas such as here

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:23.420
so whenever we find areas such as here
 

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.510
so whenever we find areas such as here
or here here that are incomplete that

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520
or here here that are incomplete that
 

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.130
or here here that are incomplete that
means that they were not selected when

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:27.140
means that they were not selected when
 

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:30.190
means that they were not selected when
we were selecting the chains for the for

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:30.200
we were selecting the chains for the for
 

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.980
we were selecting the chains for the for
the tool to follow so all we have to do

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:32.990
the tool to follow so all we have to do
 

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:36.520
the tool to follow so all we have to do
we can actually turn off the tool path

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:36.530
we can actually turn off the tool path
 

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:43.090
we can actually turn off the tool path
so we can see better here and we just

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:43.100
so we can see better here and we just
 

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:46.090
so we can see better here and we just
wrestle echt them or we can create a new

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:46.100
wrestle echt them or we can create a new
 

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:51.760
wrestle echt them or we can create a new
tool path contour and I believe it was

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:51.770
tool path contour and I believe it was
 

00:19:51.770 --> 00:20:03.130
tool path contour and I believe it was
the end of the a

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:03.140
 

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:24.230
the ii ii ii and

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240
 

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:31.169
are and I believe that was it

00:20:31.169 --> 00:20:31.179
 

00:20:31.179 --> 00:20:37.209
again contour tool

00:20:37.209 --> 00:20:37.219
 

00:20:37.219 --> 00:20:40.430
the offsets are off lead-ins and these

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:40.440
the offsets are off lead-ins and these
 

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:44.389
the offsets are off lead-ins and these
outs are off you just reset this to 0.05

00:20:44.389 --> 00:20:44.399
outs are off you just reset this to 0.05
 

00:20:44.399 --> 00:20:50.419
outs are off you just reset this to 0.05
I give and we should be good to go now

00:20:50.419 --> 00:20:50.429
I give and we should be good to go now
 

00:20:50.429 --> 00:20:53.080
I give and we should be good to go now
let's see

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:53.090
let's see
 

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:55.800
let's see
we should actually

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:55.810
we should actually
 

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:59.299
we should actually
start from

00:20:59.299 --> 00:20:59.309
 

00:20:59.309 --> 00:21:02.180
here

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:02.190
 

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:04.220
and we can

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:04.230
and we can
 

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:07.820
and we can
it's forward okay so let's left is the

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:07.830
it's forward okay so let's left is the
 

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:16.170
it's forward okay so let's left is the
second side of the a the R

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:16.180
 

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:25.970
- path contour

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:25.980
 

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:28.670
we can actually also do is we can turn

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:28.680
we can actually also do is we can turn
 

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:32.230
we can actually also do is we can turn
on this contour

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:32.240
on this contour
 

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:35.920
on this contour
and see which areas have not been chosen

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:35.930
and see which areas have not been chosen
 

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:37.630
and see which areas have not been chosen
you can see over here hasn't been chosen

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:37.640
you can see over here hasn't been chosen
 

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:41.170
you can see over here hasn't been chosen
here and the bottom of the are so do

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:41.180
here and the bottom of the are so do
 

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:46.270
here and the bottom of the are so do
another tool path contour and there's

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:46.280
another tool path contour and there's
 

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:48.400
another tool path contour and there's
one

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:48.410
one
 

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:51.690
one
and here's one

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:51.700
and here's one
 

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:55.790
and here's one
and there

00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:55.800
 

00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:01.110
and here we are and that should be it

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.120
 

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.370
tools

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:04.380
 

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:07.889
compositions off leaving lis tails off

00:22:07.889 --> 00:22:07.899
compositions off leaving lis tails off
 

00:22:07.899 --> 00:22:09.810
compositions off leaving lis tails off
and the linking parameter again has to

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:09.820
and the linking parameter again has to
 

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:17.810
and the linking parameter again has to
be set and we are good to go

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:17.820
 

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:20.910
so

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:20.920
 

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:34.600
group generate and we couldn't watch it

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:34.610
 

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:44.440
so now it's making the contours

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:44.450
 

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:48.740
you

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:48.750
 

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:53.510
and there's my nameplate now you can do

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:53.520
and there's my nameplate now you can do
 

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:58.370
and there's my nameplate now you can do
an unlimited amount of designs on the

00:22:58.370 --> 00:22:58.380
an unlimited amount of designs on the
 

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:02.200
an unlimited amount of designs on the
nameplate using the basic contour method

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:02.210
nameplate using the basic contour method
 

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:06.049
nameplate using the basic contour method
you also have different fonts that you

00:23:06.049 --> 00:23:06.059
you also have different fonts that you
 

00:23:06.059 --> 00:23:13.169
you also have different fonts that you
can choose from and in here as well

00:23:13.169 --> 00:23:13.179
 

00:23:13.179 --> 00:23:17.879
so you can also put it at the top of a

00:23:17.879 --> 00:23:17.889
so you can also put it at the top of a
 

00:23:17.889 --> 00:23:24.409
so you can also put it at the top of a
chain and make the the wording go around

00:23:24.409 --> 00:23:24.419
chain and make the the wording go around
 

00:23:24.419 --> 00:23:28.440
chain and make the the wording go around
the around or according to whichever

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:28.450
the around or according to whichever
 

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:32.599
the around or according to whichever
gene that you want so here can go inside

00:23:32.599 --> 00:23:32.609
gene that you want so here can go inside
 

00:23:32.609 --> 00:23:38.489
gene that you want so here can go inside
we can do it again create letters or

00:23:38.489 --> 00:23:38.499
we can do it again create letters or
 

00:23:38.499 --> 00:23:42.970
we can do it again create letters or
let's go back okay

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:42.980
let's go back okay
 

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:45.580
let's go back okay
um

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:45.590
 

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:47.940
create

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:47.950
create
 

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:51.970
create
letters and

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:51.980
 

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:55.000
contour and we will pick the opposite

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:55.010
contour and we will pick the opposite
 

00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:56.740
contour and we will pick the opposite
direction this is for changing the

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:56.750
direction this is for changing the
 

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:59.169
direction this is for changing the
direction and it will be on the inside

00:23:59.169 --> 00:23:59.179
direction and it will be on the inside
 

00:23:59.179 --> 00:24:02.890
direction and it will be on the inside
as you can see ah let me turn these off

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:02.900
as you can see ah let me turn these off
 

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:08.169
as you can see ah let me turn these off
so that was my last one and you can

00:24:08.169 --> 00:24:08.179
so that was my last one and you can
 

00:24:08.179 --> 00:24:10.950
so that was my last one and you can
create a myriad of shapes and designs

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:10.960
create a myriad of shapes and designs
 

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.500
create a myriad of shapes and designs
using the options that you have here

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:14.510
using the options that you have here
 

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:17.140
using the options that you have here
and that is pretty much it it's very

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:17.150
and that is pretty much it it's very
 

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:20.200
and that is pretty much it it's very
basic very simple there's only two steps

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:20.210
basic very simple there's only two steps
 

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:24.400
basic very simple there's only two steps
left and these are to create to set up

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:24.410
left and these are to create to set up
 

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:36.320
left and these are to create to set up
the stock

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:36.330
 

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:40.680
pretty much just

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:40.690
 

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:46.130
and here is the

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:46.140
 

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:49.640
the box where you can sign up what you

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:49.650
the box where you can sign up what you
 

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:52.789
the box where you can sign up what you
do is you just set the dimensions which

00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799
do is you just set the dimensions which
 

00:24:52.799 --> 00:25:01.240
do is you just set the dimensions which
as we said are two point five by six

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:01.250
 

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:06.200
point five and here you can choose where

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:06.210
point five and here you can choose where
 

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:08.780
point five and here you can choose where
the stock is held from so we will hold

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:08.790
the stock is held from so we will hold
 

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:11.539
the stock is held from so we will hold
it from this top portion here and that

00:25:11.539 --> 00:25:11.549
it from this top portion here and that
 

00:25:11.549 --> 00:25:16.060
it from this top portion here and that
will be our zeros and we will display it

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:16.070
 

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:18.890
and there you are that is stock

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:18.900
and there you are that is stock
 

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:27.080
and there you are that is stock
displayed we can we verify and we will

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:27.090
displayed we can we verify and we will
 

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:40.170
displayed we can we verify and we will
choose to go quickly and there it is

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:40.180
 

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:44.190
now what you can do is you can make your

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:44.200
now what you can do is you can make your
 

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.170
now what you can do is you can make your
ellipse a little bit small smaller than

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:46.180
ellipse a little bit small smaller than
 

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:48.750
ellipse a little bit small smaller than
the box itself so that you can make sure

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:48.760
the box itself so that you can make sure
 

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:54.210
the box itself so that you can make sure
that the tool passes over the entire

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:54.220
that the tool passes over the entire
 

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:57.090
that the tool passes over the entire
area so you do not have a flat surface

00:25:57.090 --> 00:25:57.100
area so you do not have a flat surface
 

00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:03.460
area so you do not have a flat surface
anywhere

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:03.470
 

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:07.049
and we can fast-forward through this and

00:26:07.049 --> 00:26:07.059
and we can fast-forward through this and
 

00:26:07.059 --> 00:26:08.909
and we can fast-forward through this and
there we are

00:26:08.909 --> 00:26:08.919
there we are
 

00:26:08.919 --> 00:26:13.450
there we are
that is you namely the final step is to

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:13.460
that is you namely the final step is to
 

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:15.220
that is you namely the final step is to
post process and that is pretty much

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:15.230
post process and that is pretty much
 

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:19.930
post process and that is pretty much
creating the code that we will use on

00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:19.940
creating the code that we will use on
 

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:25.690
creating the code that we will use on
the machines and that will cover I will

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:25.700
the machines and that will cover I will
 

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:31.950
the machines and that will cover I will
do a quick post-processing right now and

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:31.960
 

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:35.649
firstly we have to set up the mill the

00:26:35.649 --> 00:26:35.659
firstly we have to set up the mill the
 

00:26:35.659 --> 00:26:38.470
firstly we have to set up the mill the
type of mill that we're using so here

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480
type of mill that we're using so here
 

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:42.369
type of mill that we're using so here
the mill is default couple files and we

00:26:42.369 --> 00:26:42.379
the mill is default couple files and we
 

00:26:42.379 --> 00:26:44.470
the mill is default couple files and we
have to replace it with the type of mill

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:44.480
have to replace it with the type of mill
 

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:48.100
have to replace it with the type of mill
that we are using which is the friar MB

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:48.110
that we are using which is the friar MB
 

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:59.799
that we are using which is the friar MB
11 NLM 3000 and select okay and we will

00:26:59.799 --> 00:26:59.809
11 NLM 3000 and select okay and we will
 

00:26:59.809 --> 00:27:13.610
11 NLM 3000 and select okay and we will
post process all right all right

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:13.620
 

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:20.149
and here is the series of lines that

00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159
and here is the series of lines that
 

00:27:20.159 --> 00:27:24.500
and here is the series of lines that
will come out

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:24.510
 

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:27.049
now we will save this to your desktop as

00:27:27.049 --> 00:27:27.059
now we will save this to your desktop as
 

00:27:27.059 --> 00:27:33.540
now we will save this to your desktop as
an EM file

00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:33.550
 

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:37.720
to desktop and you can name it I'll name

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:37.730
to desktop and you can name it I'll name
 

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:47.710
to desktop and you can name it I'll name
it sample mean weight or okay small same

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:47.720
it sample mean weight or okay small same
 

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:52.630
it sample mean weight or okay small same
name and save it and we will go into our

00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640
name and save it and we will go into our
 

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:59.050
name and save it and we will go into our
desktop and there it is so you can open

00:27:59.050 --> 00:27:59.060
desktop and there it is so you can open
 

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:04.680
desktop and there it is so you can open
this with a notepad

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:04.690
 

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:10.950
and there you are now we will be

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:10.960
and there you are now we will be
 

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.649
and there you are now we will be
assigning tool numbers so and the tool

00:28:13.649 --> 00:28:13.659
assigning tool numbers so and the tool
 

00:28:13.659 --> 00:28:17.219
assigning tool numbers so and the tool
types so these tool types we will be

00:28:17.219 --> 00:28:17.229
types so these tool types we will be
 

00:28:17.229 --> 00:28:19.409
types so these tool types we will be
telling you what what which they are and

00:28:19.409 --> 00:28:19.419
telling you what what which they are and
 

00:28:19.419 --> 00:28:22.379
telling you what what which they are and
their size their width and what number

00:28:22.379 --> 00:28:22.389
their size their width and what number
 

00:28:22.389 --> 00:28:25.529
their size their width and what number
to number them and that is all you'll

00:28:25.529 --> 00:28:25.539
to number them and that is all you'll
 

00:28:25.539 --> 00:28:27.960
to number them and that is all you'll
put this on the floppy to or you'll give

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:27.970
put this on the floppy to or you'll give
 

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:29.279
put this on the floppy to or you'll give
this to me on a flash drive I'll put on

00:28:29.279 --> 00:28:29.289
this to me on a flash drive I'll put on
 

00:28:29.289 --> 00:28:30.659
this to me on a flash drive I'll put on
a floppy disk and we will run it through

00:28:30.659 --> 00:28:30.669
a floppy disk and we will run it through
 

00:28:30.669 --> 00:28:35.249
a floppy disk and we will run it through
the machines I hope this was instructive

00:28:35.249 --> 00:28:35.259
the machines I hope this was instructive
 

00:28:35.259 --> 00:28:38.669
the machines I hope this was instructive
and thank you
