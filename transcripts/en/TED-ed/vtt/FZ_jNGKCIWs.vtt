00:00:07.908 --> 00:00:12.310
All year long, researchers at hundreds
of hospitals around the world

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.019
collect samples from flu patients

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.179
and send them to top virology experts
with one goal:

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:23.268
to design the vaccine 
for the next flu season.

00:00:23.268 --> 00:00:26.379
But why do we need a new one every year?

00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:30.879
Vaccines for diseases like mumps
and rubella offer a lifetime of protection

00:00:30.879 --> 00:00:33.628
with two shots early in life.

00:00:33.628 --> 00:00:36.620
What's so special about the flu?

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.790
Two factors make the flu a tough target.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.210
First, there are more than 100 subtypes
of the influenza virus,

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.309
and the ones in circulation 
change from season to season.

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.533
And second, the flu's genetic code
allows it to mutate more quickly

00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:54.820
than many other viruses.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.910
The flu spreads by turning a host's own 
cells into viral production factories.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.681
When the virus is engulfed by a host cell,
it expels its genetic material,

00:01:05.681 --> 00:01:07.978
which makes its way to the nucleus.

00:01:07.978 --> 00:01:11.841
There, cellular machinery that normally
copies the host's genes

00:01:11.841 --> 00:01:14.882
starts replicating viral genes instead,

00:01:14.882 --> 00:01:18.317
creating more and more copies
of the virus.

00:01:18.317 --> 00:01:23.052
New viruses are repackaged 
and crammed into the cell until it bursts,

00:01:23.052 --> 00:01:29.422
sending freshly minted influenza viruses
out to infect additional cells.

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:31.892
Most viruses follow this script.

00:01:31.892 --> 00:01:35.982
The trick with the flu is that its genetic
material isn't DNA

00:01:35.982 --> 00:01:39.303
but a similar compound called RNA.

00:01:39.303 --> 00:01:44.193
And RNA viruses can mutate much faster.

00:01:44.193 --> 00:01:46.094
When cells synthesize DNA,

00:01:46.094 --> 00:01:50.354
a built-in proofreader recognizes 
and corrects mistakes,

00:01:50.354 --> 00:01:54.854
but the RNA synthesis mechanism
doesn't have this fail-safe.

00:01:54.854 --> 00:02:00.003
If errors creep in, they stick around
creating new variants of the virus.

00:02:00.003 --> 00:02:01.393
Why is this a problem?

00:02:01.393 --> 00:02:04.623
Because vaccines depend on recognition.

00:02:04.623 --> 00:02:09.364
The flu vaccine includes some of the same
substances, called antigens,

00:02:09.364 --> 00:02:12.556
found on the surface of the virus itself.

00:02:12.556 --> 00:02:15.654
The body identifies those fragments
as foreign

00:02:15.654 --> 00:02:19.063
and responds by producing compounds
called antibodies,

00:02:19.063 --> 00:02:22.094
tailor-made to match the antigens.

00:02:22.094 --> 00:02:25.154
When a vaccinated person
encounters the actual virus,

00:02:25.154 --> 00:02:29.614
the preprogrammed antibodies
help the immune system identify the threat

00:02:29.614 --> 00:02:33.695
and mobilize quickly 
to prevent an infection.

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:37.886
Those antigens are different 
for every strain of influenza.

00:02:37.886 --> 00:02:41.326
If vaccination has prepared 
the immune system for one strain,

00:02:41.326 --> 00:02:44.577
a different one may still 
be able to sneak by.

00:02:44.577 --> 00:02:47.085
Even within the same strain of flu,

00:02:47.085 --> 00:02:51.216
those rapid genetic mutations
can change the surface compounds enough

00:02:51.216 --> 00:02:55.366
that the antibodies 
may not recognize them.

00:02:55.366 --> 00:02:57.358
To make things even more complicated,

00:02:57.358 --> 00:03:03.167
sometimes two different strains combine
to create an entirely new hybrid virus.

00:03:03.167 --> 00:03:06.286
All of this makes vaccinating for the flu

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:10.067
like trying to hit a moving 
transforming target.

00:03:10.067 --> 00:03:12.887
That's why scientists are constantly
collecting data

00:03:12.887 --> 00:03:15.108
about which strains are circulating

00:03:15.108 --> 00:03:17.819
and checking to see how much those
strains have mutated

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.447
from previous years' versions.

00:03:20.447 --> 00:03:24.398
Twice annually, the World 
Health Organization pulls together experts

00:03:24.398 --> 00:03:26.387
to analyze all that data,

00:03:26.387 --> 00:03:29.558
holding one meeting for each hemisphere.

00:03:29.558 --> 00:03:33.788
The scientists determine which strains
to include in that season's vaccine,

00:03:33.788 --> 00:03:38.090
picking four for the quadrivalent vaccine
in use today.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.398
In spite of the flu's evasive maneuvers,

00:03:40.398 --> 00:03:45.808
in recent years, the group's predictions
have been almost always correct.

00:03:45.808 --> 00:03:50.109
Even when flu strains mutate further,
the vaccine is often close enough

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:53.309
that a vaccinated person who catches
the flu anyway

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:58.139
will have a milder and shorter illness
than they would otherwise.

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:01.560
Vaccination also helps protect
other people in the community

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.110
who may not be medically eligible 
for the shot

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.512
by preventing those around them
from carrying the virus.

00:04:07.512 --> 00:04:09.778
This is called herd immunity.

00:04:09.778 --> 00:04:12.050
The flu shot can't give you the flu.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.199
It contains an inactivated virus
that isn't capable of making you sick.

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.000
You might feel tired 
and achy after getting it,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.710
but that's not an infection.

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:23.841
It's your normal immune response
to the vaccine.

00:04:23.841 --> 00:04:27.861
Some parts of the world use, 
instead of a shot, an inhaled vaccine

00:04:27.861 --> 00:04:30.709
that contains a weakened live virus.

00:04:30.709 --> 00:04:35.041
This is also safe for 
the vast majority of people.

00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:38.512
Only those with impaired immune systems
would be at risk,

00:04:38.512 --> 00:04:41.920
but they're typically 
not given live vaccines.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.951
Meanwhile, scientists are working
to develop a universal flu vaccine

00:04:45.951 --> 00:04:49.502
that would protect against any strain,
even mutated ones.

00:04:49.502 --> 00:04:53.562
But until then, the hunt 
for next year's vaccine is on.
