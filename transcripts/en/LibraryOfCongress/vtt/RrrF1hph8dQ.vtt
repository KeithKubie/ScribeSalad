00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.220
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.920 position:56%
&gt;&gt; A few weeks ago, we made a public
call for researchers, librarians

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.830
and technologists to share how
they are applying the Collections

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.990
as Data concept to their work.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.750 position:56%
Each of these speakers will have
five minutes throughout this session

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.580
to talk about their projects.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.750 position:56%
We will hear from Steven Weinberger,
Chelsea Stieber, Kevin Schlottmann,

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.790
Ascension Mazuela-Anguita,
Ed Summers, Paul Farber,

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.050
Jared Nielsen, and William Ferster.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.350
Steven.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.700
&gt;&gt; I'm Steven Weinberger.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.980
I'm the director of linguistics
at George Mason University.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.310
I'm a phonologist by training,
and I study speech accents.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.880
And we've put together a
little speech accent database

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.160
at George Mason University.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.510
So how did this begin?

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.010
In 1999, I gave an assignment
to my phonetics class

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.810
and they were interested
in teaching ESL.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.530
And so they went out and
recorded non-native speakers

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.280
and they used all sorts of
magnetic tape and different kinds

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.580
of tape recorders,

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.930
and we systematized it
and put it on the web.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.560 position:56%
And it's been on the web since 1999.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.250 position:56%
In 2002, it was picked up and is now
hosted by the Roy Rosenzweig Center

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.990
for History and New
Media at George Mason.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.990
I want to thank them
for keeping it up.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.550
What's the purpose of this archive?

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.150 position:56%
To demystify and to
scientifically study speech accents,

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.290
English accents, by the way.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.980
And the database continues
to expand.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:40.190
The Corpus has currently --
today it has 2399 samples,

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:46.870
310 native language
backgrounds from ASL to Zulu,

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:54.040 position:56%
175 countries are represented,
there's 165,462 words at the moment.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.830
It's used by a variety of visitors
like linguists, ESL teachers,

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.430
engineers, speech pathologists,
actors, and most of the time,

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.730
people doing drinking games.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:10.580 position:56%
These are all the languages that are
represented -- language backgrounds.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.620
Everyone is reading the
same English paragraph.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.310
That's what makes the
archive a bit unique.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.110
The architecture includes an
elicitation paragraph audio sample

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.430
-- oh, I can look down here --

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.230
some demographic information about
each speaker, maps of locations,

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.960
phonetic transcriptions, which I'll
show you an example of in a moment,

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.050
phonological speech patterns

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.260
like what makes a German speaker
different from a Zulu speaker

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.870
of English, segment inventories
of each of the native languages,

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.050
and it also has the opportunity
for remote researchers to send

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.520
in accents from all over the world.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.690
And it has a search facility, 69
words in the elicitation paragraph.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:01.350 position:56%
It's the famous "please call Stella"
paragraph -- famous to me, at least.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.650
That's the whole paragraph.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:03.950
Everyone reads it.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.200
We have a strict recording
protocol, it's CD quality,

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.400
and we reduce it to MP3 128 bits.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.140
And let's see if this
will work for you.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.570
You can listen to some
of these things.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.430
Everyone recognizes an accent
as soon as they can hear it.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.260
Tell me if you think
this is a non-native.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.960
&gt;&gt; Please call Estelle.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.790
&gt;&gt; Can we turn it up a little bit?

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.090
I'll do it again.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.340
&gt;&gt; Please call Estelle.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.260
&gt;&gt; Please call Stella.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.710
&gt;&gt; Can you hear all that?

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.580
&gt;&gt; Please call Stella.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.700
&gt;&gt; Anyway, those are
three non-natives.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.250
Can you guess the languages?

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.150
No. The first one is Amharic, the
second one is Mandarin Chinese,

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.140
and the third one is Russian.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.190
You can listen to them on your own
at another point on the archive.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.520
The speaker demographics
come like this.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.570 position:56%
We asked them their native language.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.040
Of course there are 310
of them at the moment.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.750
It's linked to an Ethnologue code.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.640
We asked what other languages they
know, residency includes place

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.180
of birth, English language
residents,

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.030
length of English residency,
the gender of the individual,

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.710
the age of the individual,

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.800
the English onset age,
and the learning style.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.190
Everyone's asked the
same seven questions.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.710
So this is all searchable
information.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.430
And there's room for some notes.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.030
Here is the paragraph transcribed

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.900
with our funny phonetic
alphabet that linguists use.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.630
I don't know if you'll
be able to hear this.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.270
Let's see.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.720
This is a --

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.360
&gt;&gt; Please call Stella.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.460
Ask her to bring these things
with her from the store.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:53.720
Six spoons of snow peas, five
thick slabs of blue cheese,

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.190
and maybe a snack for
her brother Bob.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.200
We also need a small plastic --

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.860
&gt;&gt; So you can listen to all that.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.620
I'm sure you were able to
follow along with the phonetics

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.080
that we wrote there for you.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.190
The phonetic inventories that
are included in the archive,

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.050
for each of the languages,
at least 210 of them,

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.680
are given in some form like this.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.900
They're all uniform and you can
compare Vietnamese to English

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.340
and find out why a Vietnamese
speaker is doing what she is doing

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.010
when she speaks English or why a
German speaker does what she does

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.110
when she speaks English.

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.810
And the search facility
looks something like this.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.190
You can point it to searches on
all the data on the archives.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:43.640
So for research, the data is
freely available, has a uniform --

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.710
it's uniform so that you can use it
to compare one accent to another,

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.640
because everyone's
reading the same thing.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.710
It's turning into a
massive database,

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.480
so a lot of speech engineers
are asking for it to use

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.970
to train their machines
to understand speech.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.730
And we are now understanding
with the archive a little better

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.380
of what it means to have an accent,

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.010
what it means to scientifically
study an accent,

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.380
and what affects an accent.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.650
Some of the most crucial
factors involved

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.360
in accent are listed right there.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.940
What your native language is,
when you began to learn English

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.510
or study English, your
length of residence

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.730
and where, and your learning style.

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.340
And it's quite useful.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.640
Thank you.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.990
I think I made it within
five minutes.

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.490 position:56%
&gt;&gt; My name is Chelsea Stieber, and
I'm going to be talking to you today

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:40.860
about Caribbean periodicals.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.370
Just to introduce myself,
I am a Kluge fellow

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.610
at the Kluge Center here
at the Library of Congress,

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.780 position:56%
and in my other life, I am a
professor at the Catholic University

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.930
of America, Assistant Professor
in French and Francophone Studies.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.280
So yes, I'm going to be
talking to you about periodicals

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.960
and the catalog, more specifically
about a project I'm developing here

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.150
with a group of scholars on a
specific Haitian periodical,

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:08.330
The Journal of the Haitian Society
of History, Geography, and Geology.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.000
So every good digital
humanities project has a problem

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.700 position:56%
and a solution, so I'll present
those here in the short time I have.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.640
So this journal is Haiti's most
significant social science journal

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:20.970
of the 20th century.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.270
It's actually still around.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:25.090
It was founded in 1923.

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:29.620
It's almost 100 years of
scholarship, over 250 issues.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.580
It's the most important repository
of locally produced knowledge

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.330
and of academic and social science
research coming out of Haiti.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.990
And yet, and here's the problem,
US and really North American

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:44.050
and North Atlantic
academics don't cite it.

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:45.350
They don't use it.

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:49.990
It's really rarely used and
read and it's not part of sort

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.310
of our academic discourse.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:54.380
And so the question is why?

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.920
And there are a lot of reasons why.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.800
I certainly don't have
the time to get into here,

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.410
and it would take us hours
and hours to discuss,

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:04.550
but there is one really
interesting reason why,

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.780
and it's something I discovered
while doing my research here

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:10.970
at the Library, and that is
specifically how periodicals exist

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:14.290
in the Library space and
in the Library catalog.

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:18.420
Periodicals, when they come into
the Library, they are cataloged,

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.360
but they are not indexed.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.060
So here I have a reproduction
of the catalog entry

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:28.500
for this Social Science Journal,
and here we have a representation

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.800
of 100 years of scholarship, local
Caribbean knowledge production,

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.290
that is effectively
illegible in the catalog.

00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:39.610
That is, we have our subject
heading, Haiti Periodicals,

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:42.250
and actually the title
itself is quite explanatory,

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:45.110
but beyond that we don't
know what's inside.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:47.640
And this isn't an indictment
of the Library catalog,

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:51.330 position:56%
this is precisely how the catalog is
supposed to work, but the problem is

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:55.020
that we don't get to know what's
inside, because it's not indexed.

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.550
And I think this is specifically
important for the Caribbean,

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:03.510
and the global South more broadly,
because periodicals like this,

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:04.870
this journal, this is

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:08.720
where knowledge production is
happening in the 20th century.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:12.350
It's the privileged medium for
Caribbean academic research,

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:15.310
for local knowledge
production, and for scholarship.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:19.430
And with this content
being virtually illegible

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:22.070
to our searching, it's no wonder

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.490
that people aren't
using it or citing it.

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:27.310
So with that in mind, we
decided to try and come

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:29.560
up with a project to solve that.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:33.990
So what we're trying to do is
expand access to this journal

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.150
and the impact of this
scholarship, this 100 years

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:39.160
of scholarship that
the Library holds.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:43.530
And, in fact, the Library is one of
the few that has a nearly full run

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:46.060
of this journal, and so we
really wanted to highlight it

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:49.620 position:56%
and get people citing it, get people
using it in academic research.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:53.520
So we finished Phase
One of our project,

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.390
which is to create a database.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:10:01.490
So we, this team, we've basically
indexed every issue of the Journal,

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:03.180
subject, headings, and
so on and so forth,

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.050
and so now we have our database.

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:09.060
And the next step of the
project is to develop a scholarly

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:13.150
and collaborative space for
people to access the content

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:16.780
in searchable form and
engage with the scholarship.

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:22.550
And here I just wanted to sort
of shout out and cite some people

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:26.420
who are doing really best practices
in Caribbean digital scholarship,

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:30.900
and that is the folks at Small
Axe Archipelagos, and I just want

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.200
to read from their website.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.310
And if you haven't heard
of them, check them out.

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:35.610
They are great.

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:38.330
"How might we encourage
collaboration with,

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.910
increase accessibility for, and
otherwise work to narrow the gap

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:44.550
between Caribbeanist
researchers, especially those

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:46.120
in the North Atlantic Academy,

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.900
and the communities we
are committed to serving."

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.830
And so as we move forward
into Phase Two,

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.960
building this collaborative
space, which will be a site

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:58.410
with labs.loc.gov, we wanted
to take this idea as sort

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:03.490 position:56%
of our driving focus or inspiration,
which is going to take sort

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:07.920
of the desire to reactivate this
library holding, this rich holding

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.890
in the library collection, and
make it available to researchers,

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:12.940
not just in this North
Atlantic space,

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.260
but also in the Caribbean as well.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:19.950
So we're envisioning annotations,
translations, thematic groupings

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:22.330
of content, creating a dynamic,

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:26.430
vibrant space that will
improve access and impact

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:28.050
to this Caribbean periodical.

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:32.060
Again, this is in the works,
it's still in development now,

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.820 position:56%
and so I would love to hear from you

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:37.200
if you have questions,
ideas, advice, thoughts.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.940
This, already, conference
today has been

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.360
so illuminating for
that reason for me.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.040
So please, I'll be here after the
conference, but also for those

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.550
of you virtually who are
tuning into the live stream,

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.660
please tweet at me and be in touch.

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.960
Thank you very much.

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:54.390
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon, everybody.

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:55.690
My name is Kevin Schlottmann.

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:58.660
I am the Digital Archives Manager
at the New York Philharmonic,

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.210
and today I'm going to talk
about, in my five minutes here,

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:03.330
the New York Philharmonic
subscriber's project.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.090
It's a project that we did
in conjunction with a group

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:09.440
of sociologists whose names and
affiliations you see up here

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.270
with support from the
Mellon Foundation.

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:17.960
You can tweet us @nyphilarchive
and today's hashtag is #asdata.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.920
Before I go into the project, I
just very briefly want to talk

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.060
about the mass digitization
that we are doing.

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:27.340
Since 2008, we have been supported
by the Leon Levy Foundation

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.450
to the tune of $5 million
to digitize every last scrap

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:32.110
of paper in our archives.

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:36.650
Our archives go back to 1842 and
document the oldest orchestra

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:40.110
in North America and one of
the three oldest in the world.

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:43.280
We have extremely rich and
deep archives in a variety

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:47.630
of formats including music, we
not only have scores and parts

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:50.550
that are interesting in their
own right, but they are marked

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:53.210
by the conductors who have
led the New York Philharmonic

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:54.580
and the musicians who have played

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:57.820
in the New York Philharmonic
for the last 175 years.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:00.510
So these provide a tremendous
insight into the development

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:03.090
of orchestral performance practice.

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:06.470
We have a complete set of
programs going back to 1842,

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:08.860
from which we have
also extracted data,

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:10.550
which I'll talk about
more in a moment.

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:15.310
Photos, of course, 10,000 folders
of business records are archived,

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:20.070 position:56%
ranging from minutes, posters,
correspondence, down to [inaudible],

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:22.510
things like receipts
and that sort of thing.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:26.040
As well as 70,000 pages of
press clippings dating back

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.340
to the very early 20th century,
essentially every mention

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:33.100
of the New York Philharmonic in
the American press, both national

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:37.600
and local, as well as a lot of
international press as well.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:42.250
So the subscribers project,
we have information relating

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:44.890
to our subscribers, so people
who bought more than one ticket

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.030
or people who bought
tickets to a series,

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:49.720
dating all the way back to 1842.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.650
And we have -- we know their
names, we know their addresses,

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:53.960
we know what seats they bought,

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.410
we know for how long they were
engaged with the orchestra.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:59.610
A couple of years after we
launched the digital archives,

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:03.360
a group of sociologists approached
us and asked, can we do something

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.660
with this subscriber data?

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:05.960
We have some thoughts.

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:09.190
And since it had been
digitized, it was relatively easy,

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:11.570
and I say relatively
because underscoring a point

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:14.020
that many people have made today,
there's a lot of human labor

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.620
that goes into extracting
data from these things.

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:20.560
But it was relatively easy to take
the digitized 19th century books

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.950
that you see here on
the right and turn it

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:26.850
into a nice adjacent data set.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:29.920
They originally were
going to look at trying

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:33.330
to correlate social status
using addresses of proxy

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:35.840
with where people were
actually sitting in the hall.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.520
They ended up going a
slightly different direction,

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.780
but that was their initial impetus.

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:43.180
And then when they were done,
they gave the data to us

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:45.350
and we have this nice
little web widget

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:48.130
where people can search a
select portion of the data

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:51.210
and also the entire
subscriber data set is available

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:53.520
as a CSV download from our website.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:57.490
It's an anonymized post-1951 to
protect the more recent folks,

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:00.720
but all the data's there for
anybody who wants to use it.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.710
So what did the sociologists
actually find?

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:07.460
Well, when they got into
the data, they dug in

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:11.440
and they gave us a more nuanced
understanding of the nature

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:15.360
of 19th century social status.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.750
I think this is really interesting
to me because they use the data

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.790
to -- we know the kind
of the big picture

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:26.160
of gilded era social consolidation,
but they used the data

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.820
to find something that they
called segregated inclusion,

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:30.120
which I'm going to read it.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.420
I apologize.

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:32.730
"It's a form of inclusion
that preserved the purity

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:35.040
and distinctiveness
of the social elite

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:38.100
by allowing the non-elite cultural
experts access to the concert hall,

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:41.330
but in a limited way that
reified the high-class status

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:42.860
of the orchestra and
its subscribers."

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:47.880
So that's a really nice, nuanced
twist on our understanding

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:53.270
of how 19th century social
conglomeration worked in New York.

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:54.570
It's a wonderful paper.

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:57.960
It's coming out next year in
a leading sociology journal.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:01.290
And not only did they use
our subscriber database,

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:03.620
they also used our
performance database.

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:08.830
So we have data for every
performance going back to 1842,

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:12.160
where it happened, when it
happened, what the repertoire was,

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.510
who the conductor was,
who the soloists were,

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:17.500
whether it was an encore, and all
of that data is available both

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.120
on our website at the
performance history,

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.960
as well as downloadable data
on XML and JSON on GitHub

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.620
that I update on a monthly basis.

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:28.970
So you can look up our entire
performance repertoire,

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:31.580
pretty much up to date
whenever you want.

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:36.870
All of our archives are available
for free at archives.nyphil.org.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:39.740
Go check it out, and
in my last 30 seconds,

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.090
I'd just like to say I thank
you to the sociologists

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:43.930
for approaching us
in doing this work.

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:46.710
Thanks to LC for hosting
us all here today.

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:49.690
Thanks to my colleagues in the
archives, especially Barbara Haws,

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:52.090
who has been the archivist and
historian at the Philharmonic

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:55.360
for many years and is really
the driver behind this

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.750
digitization project.

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:59.650 position:56%
And to the Leon Levy Foundation,
who have been kind enough to fund us

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:01.350
for all of this digitization.

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:03.650
Thank you.

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:09.660
&gt;&gt; Ascension Mazuela.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:11.730
I am glad to be here.

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:15.520
Alan Lomax recorded
hundreds of songs in Spain

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:22.760
between June 1952 and
[inaudible] 1953.

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:26.430
[inaudible] of this journey
include music on magnetic tape,

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:29.820
but also photographs,
notebooks, voices, letters,

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:33.430
and diaries preserved at
the American Folklife Center

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:35.340
at the Library of Congress.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:38.840
[inaudible] my research is to
analyze the documents in order

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:43.280 position:56%
to establish connections between
the songs recorded by Lomax in Spain

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:47.500
and other collections of the
Spanish traditional music such as

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.990
that preserved at the Spanish
National Research Council

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:52.550
in Barcelona.

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:55.660
Although it includes
some music recordings,

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:59.160
the Barcelona collection is
primarily made up of more

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.920
than 20,000 folk songs
copied on paper

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:08.200
and collected throughout
Spain between 1944 and 1960.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.440
Most of them, through the
[inaudible] commissioned

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.890
by the former Spanish
Institute of Musicology.

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:17.950
Since the materials at
Library of Congress and those

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:21.650
in Barcelona were collected
around the same time,

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:26.100
often in the same villages, and
even using the same performers,

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:29.840
it is clear that the collections
complement one another,

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:34.410 position:56%
but to what extent is still unknown.

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:38.580
The Barcelona collection is
being digitized and cataloged

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:40.680
in an open-access database

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.500
into which they have
incorporated the details provided

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.320
by the Lomax collection.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:49.630
Cataloging information on all the
songs [inaudible] recorded by Lomax

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:54.070
in Spain including his photographs
and links to all the files.

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:58.290
I have also cataloged
and transcribed documents

00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:01.870
such as notebooks, letters
and diaries, connected them

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:05.790
to the music, people, and
locations to which they refer,

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:09.140
and including links to the
corresponding digitization

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:11.610
on the Library of Congress website.

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:14.580
The [inaudible] have
prepared a collection

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:20.320 position:56%
for [inaudible] comparison and it
is possible to identify concordances

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.780
between this collection at
the Library of Congress,

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:25.960
and that in Barcelona,
[inaudible] locations,

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:29.090
[inaudible] musical
genres and songs.

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:32.540
The Barcelona collection
includes, for instance,

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:35.830
several songs performed
by this woman

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:40.090
from a small [inaudible] village
in the form of transcriptions made

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:44.960
by the Spanish [inaudible] in 1951.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:50.100 position:56%
[inaudible] later, Lomax recorded
20 songs performed by the same woman

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:54.380
in the same place, and some of them
coincide with those transcribed

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:57.510
by [inaudible], as in this example.

00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:21.080
[ Foreign language ]

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:26.190
&gt;&gt; [inaudible], I am using the
database as a research tool

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:30.740
for interpreting data on
[inaudible] on the meaning

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:34.620
of these concordances
[inaudible] Spain,

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:37.770
in order to assess how this
[inaudible] would determine his

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:41.750
[inaudible] and the music and
people he chose to record.

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:46.970
This digital tool also makes data
accessible to other researchers.

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:51.710
At the same time, through the
database and the social networks

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:54.530
to which it is connected,
Lomax's contribution

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:57.300
to Spanish traditional
music can be better known

00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:01.290
and appreciated by
a general audience.

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:05.450
In order to provide a different
approach both to the database

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:10.040 position:56%
and to the Lomax Spanish collection,
I am creating a story map

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.980
which presents Lomax's
itinerary [inaudible] Spain,

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:17.040
connecting each town to an example
of the music recorded there,

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:20.300
to a related [inaudible]
belonging to the Lomax collection

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.460
and to a link to the complete
information concerning

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:25.980
that location on the database.

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:29.890 position:56%
The main purpose of this application
is to make data more visible,

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:31.850
not only to researchers, but also

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:35.700
to our [inaudible] audience
outside the [inaudible] context.

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.600
Thus, as a researcher,
I have benefitted

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:42.620
from making this collection
available as data.

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:46.080
[inaudible] able to analyze,
compare and interpret information

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.780
in order to produce [inaudible].

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:51.220
At the same time, the accessibility

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:56.700 position:56%
of the collection [inaudible] easily
searchable in an interactive way

00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:00.630
through the database and the map
application allows descendents

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:04.330
of the performers and school
teachers, and the community

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:08.920
in general to use and enjoy
this magnificent collection,

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:13.730
increasing the sociological impact.

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:15.030
Thank you.

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:17.610
&gt;&gt; This is a picture
of a bunch of numbers.

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:21.140
I guess that's a joke.

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:24.930
But imagine this is a file, right?

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:29.070
And what I'm hoping to do in the
next five minutes is convince you

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:32.270
that this is a collection
of data, and not only that,

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:36.250
but that it's a useful
collection of data.

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:42.940
So I work on a project
called Documenting the Now,

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:46.120
which is a Mellon funded project

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:53.010
to help build social media
archiving tools and practices,

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:55.060
with a particular focus on Twitter,

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:59.970
which is kind of a third-rail
type of topic here, but --

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.340
And so I thought I would --

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:08.490 position:56%
and actually my collaborator that I
work with, Burgess [inaudible] spoke

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:13.890
at this event last year, and maybe
some of you remember his talk.

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:21.410
He -- this is one slide that he
had that he showed and Burgess,

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:24.950
when he was here, was
really trying to impress

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:30.340
on everyone the importance of
doing social media archiving

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:34.860
in the context of large
state and corporate actors

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:38.680
that are also doing social
media archiving for the purposes

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:42.170
of surveillance and control, right?

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:45.570
And so our project is
interested in memory, right?

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:50.260 position:56%
So we're remembering social media
for the purposes of cultural memory,

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:53.710
but at the same time, we
have actors like Geofeedia,

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:57.120
who are sort of building
social media collections

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:02.330
that they are then advertising to
a police department in California

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:05.360
that they can help the
police department sort

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:10.330
of manage the Ferguson
situation, right?

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:14.090
And so the challenge that
we've been working on is well,

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:18.560
how do we do social media
archiving while this is going on?

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:23.390
How do we do it in an ethical
way that respects the voices

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:29.770
and the content of the people that
are creating the content, right?

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:35.550
That's kind of the
challenge that we've had.

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:39.230
And so there's no silver
bullet here.

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:43.330 position:56%
There's no technical solution that's
really going to do this for us,

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:46.570
but we found -- the one
little silver lining

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:51.380
that we found is actually in
Twitter's terms of service itself.

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:56.780
They actually don't allow people --
so you have to agree to the terms

00:24:56.780 --> 00:25:01.970
of service to get data from
Twitter, and one of the rules

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:05.200
that they have is that you can't
download data and then just sort

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.850
of put it on the web, right?

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:10.590
You can't download millions
of tweets and then sort

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:12.730
of put them in an archive.

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:17.160
Because for them, it's sort
of a business decision, right?

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:20.230
They have reasons why they
don't want that to happen.

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:23.000
But one of the interesting
things that they do let you do is

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.970
to take a file of tweet IDs, so
each tweet has a numeric identifier

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:32.560
that identifies it, and they do
allow you to distribute those.

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:38.610
And what you can do with a tweet
identifier, then, is then go back

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:42.380
to Twitter's API and get
the data for that tweet.

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:45.970
An interesting thing
that happens there is

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:48.930
that if the tweet has been
deleted or if the user has decided

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:51.250
to protect their account
or delete their account,

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:52.910
you can no longer get that tweet.

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:57.020
So it kind of empowers the user,
it gives them some level of control

00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:00.840
over how their content is
used elsewhere on the web.

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:07.830
Which leads me to one -- I
should've said at the beginning--

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:09.680
talk about two applications.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.670
If I don't run out of time.

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:15.980
But this is the first application
that I was going to mention.

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:17.280
It's called the catalog.

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:21.590 position:56%
And really all the catalog is, is --
I mean really, it's just a web page

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:24.690
that lists data sets of tweet IDs

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:28.110
that different researchers have
created for different purposes,

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:29.480
and sort of put them in one place

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.770
so that other researchers
can find them.

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:35.570
And so they have a description
of the data set, who created it,

00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:40.570
how many tweets are in it, what
date range, that kind of stuff,

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:44.120
why they created it,
and then a link to go

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:46.730
to a repository that's
somewhere else on the web, right,

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:50.140
so this is just a clearinghouse for
the data sets that live elsewhere,

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:53.190
and they can download it.

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:56.660 position:56%
And so once you download it, you end
up with something like this, right,

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:59.960
a file with a bunch
of numbers in it.

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:04.310
And so the other application I
thought I'd mention really quick,

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:08.140
is the hydrator application,
which basically,

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:10.490
it's a desktop application
you download

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:12.610
and run on your own workstation.

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:20.830 position:56%
It will read a data set of tweet IDs
and do what they call hydrate them,

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:25.640
so turn them back into the data
that is useful for research.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:32.230
And one of the other things it does
is it will convert the Twitter JSON

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:35.420
data to CSV that once
it's finished downloading.

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:38.240
We heard a little bit about
CSV earlier from [inaudible].

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:44.350
It's like a format that's used
a lot in all kinds of analysis.

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:46.980
So actually that's
really the majority

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:48.280
of what I wanted to talk about.

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:50.780
So I see that my time is up.

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:55.250
So these are a few
URLs if you're curious.

00:27:55.250 --> 00:28:00.800
The top one has links
to everything else,

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.890 position:56%
the two applications I talked about.

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:05.190
So thanks for your time.

00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:10.130
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:11.430
I'm Paul Farber.

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:17.590
I'm the Artistic Director of
Monument Lab, a public art

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:21.110
and history project
based in Philadelphia.

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:25.290
Thank you to the Library of
Congress for hosting us all today.

00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:31.180
In my day job, I'm a historian
and curator, and I represent

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:38.660
and lead a collective of scholars,
curators, artists and students

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:43.020
around this project since 2014.

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:46.280
And we're interested in
building temporary monuments

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:50.840
in public spaces, and
data sets that endure

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:56.130
in libraries and online
as open data.

00:28:56.130 --> 00:29:02.160 position:56%
We're gearing up for a big fall 2017
citywide exhibition in Philadelphia

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:05.140
with the Mural Arts Program.

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:08.690
Our project centers
around a question.

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:12.990
What is an appropriate monument for
the current city of Philadelphia?

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:19.040
We have a city full of public
art and statues, murals,

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:23.650
but sometimes we need assistance
to fill in what is there.

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:30.090
So this project is one where we use
this question to invite people in.

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:34.870
We ask artists to build temporary
monuments and we ask this

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:41.620 position:56%
to the public as a way to measure
both the expected, or the municipal,

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:46.510
and also understand the possible,
the dreamed, the speculative,

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:50.030
the haunts of the city to
have a more complete vision

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:52.810
of our historical landscape.

00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:56.280
We're working with 20
artists from around the world

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:58.630
and around Philadelphia
who are going

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:02.090
to be building these
monuments in public spaces.

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:07.730
Some will use the kind of
traditional formats, bronze,

00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:12.210
granite, but others are going to
build their monuments with sound,

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:15.840
light, performance, interactivity.

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:20.160
Many of these artists take
on issues of social justice,

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:24.080
especially around race,
gender, sexuality, class,

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.510
national belonging, to make sure

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:30.710
that our monumental landscape
represents a city founded

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:34.690 position:56%
on freedom, justice, and toleration.

00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:37.990
Their works will be sited
around the city of Philadelphia

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:43.470
in our five central squares
that go back to the 1680s,

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:46.450
and five neighborhood parks.

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:51.590
At each of these sites, there's
at least one temporary monument

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:56.320
and a learning lab, where
we use this research form.

00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:01.940
On this form, we ask the
public to name their monuments,

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:05.600
place it somewhere in the city,
an address, an intersection,

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.380
a neighborhood, though
that often is broken.

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.170
You'll see in a moment.

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:16.090
We also ask them in a big open
space to describe or sketch.

00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:21.540 position:56%
In addition, if people want to leave
their home zip code, their age,

00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:26.820
their social media handle,
they can add that on as well.

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:28.940
This is not the first
time that we've done this.

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:32.540
Back in 2015 in the
courtyard of City Hall,

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:34.110
we had our Discovery Phase,

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:36.780
thanks to the Pew Center
for Arts and Heritage.

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:41.060
Here, our temporary monument
by the late Terry Adkins,

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:46.690
was an empty classroom to comment
on educational pride that we have

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:51.040
in the city, and also the fact of
budget cuts and school closures

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:53.750
that marked our current
civic landscape.

00:31:53.750 --> 00:32:00.580 position:56%
In addition to this classroom, we
had the different kind of classroom,

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:05.750 position:56%
the learning lab, where teams mostly
of youth researchers from college

00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:09.090
and high school would
gather public proposals.

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:13.350
In the three and a half weeks that
we were in the City Hall courtyard,

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:23.780
we had 455 people leave monument
proposals, we had 4000 people come

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:31.190 position:56%
to free programs every day, and over
30,000 people visit the monument.

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:38.330
When you see these pieces here,
this comprises an imagination

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:43.560
of the city, and on one hand each
piece matters and the data set

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:47.520
as a whole both stand out.

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:53.240
For each piece, it can be seen
in the lab itself at a museum

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:57.400
or gallery and is deposited
in a local library.

00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:00.040
Some snapshots here.

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:04.980
Dancing with love in your step,
right in the heart of the city.

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:10.290
Door to door, an imaginative
portal between neighborhoods.

00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:15.940
In the City of Brotherly Love,
I don't love you, but I -- .

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:22.900
Of course there's poignant and
important forms of truth-telling.

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:27.480
Someone who's wary of the murder
crisis in our city called attention

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:31.350
to the shrines around the
city at sites of violence.

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:36.420
Others were more poetic, blurring
the boundary between the vision

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:41.200
of a statue or just an
exchange between Philadelphians.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:44.510
And then, of course, the complex.

00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:47.980
Like Claes Oldenburg said,
"Proposing monuments is

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:51.060
like composing with the city."

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:55.010
In addition to the individuals,
you can see the data set.

00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:59.530
You can see it on a
map, across the city.

00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:04.220
We've also transcribed and
analyzed and done initial level

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:08.770
of classification that
is on Open Data Philly,

00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:13.950
the portal for civic data in the
city, so alongside crime statistics

00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:20.530
and traffic incidents, this data
set that is powered by speculation,

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:24.770
by cultural memory, is available.

00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:28.870
Ultimately our goal is to change
the way that we write the history

00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:32.380
of our city together,
and we take up the call

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:39.210 position:56%
for cultural heritage organizations
to find new ways to bring in voices,

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:45.030
people, and data, not just
to be powered by imagination,

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:49.380
but also to co-author the next
chapters of our city's history.

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:51.680
Thank you.

00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:57.550
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is Jared Nielsen.

00:34:57.550 --> 00:35:00.650
I'm an artist and instructor at
George Washington University,

00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:04.940
where I teach full
stack web development.

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:08.790
I recently discovered the
digital collections available

00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:12.390
to the public on LC's website.

00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:13.930
If you haven't discovered
it yourself,

00:35:13.930 --> 00:35:16.220
I highly recommend browsing this.

00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:17.780
You'll lose hours of your day.

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:19.660
It's a fantastic collection.

00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:24.040
There's on collection in
particular that caught my eye.

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:26.460 position:56%
There's this pictorial of St. Louis.

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:31.160
It's a series of plates that were
published as an atlas in 1875

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:33.280
by the artist Camille Dry.

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:39.810
This was created at this time as
an act of boosterism by the city

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:42.510
when they were making a bid to
become the nation's capital,

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:45.480
but they thought their
position on the Mississippi,

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:49.860
being a massive trade economic
route was more suitable

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:53.630
for our nation's future
than this current swamp.

00:35:55.610 --> 00:36:00.400
These plates are incredibly
detailed and beautiful,

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.110
and one other thing I
thought was really interesting

00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:07.750
when I found these is that
there was no technology used

00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:09.050
in their creation.

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:11.130
There's no airplane,
there's no hot air balloon.

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:16.780
This was all Camille Dry and
his team beating the pavement,

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:23.590
making these records, and
then transposing their 2D data

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:26.700
into a 3D aerial perspective
representation.

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:30.330
So here's a little more
of the detail here.

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:40.650
So the atlas was published with
a key that shows you where,

00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:44.990
which plates where they lined up
with their geographic position

00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:48.480
in relation to St. Louis.

00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:51.790
Because these were all hand-drawn,

00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:54.200
some of the plates have
these interesting features

00:36:54.200 --> 00:37:01.770
where a landmark is breaking the
frame and I wanted to keep this

00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:05.390
when I -- well, first, let me
just say when I discovered this,

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:07.020
I wanted to do something with this.

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:10.090 position:56%
If we step back to the key, I wanted

00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:15.040
to see all the plates stitched
together as one large map.

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:18.040
And this is one of the
issues I encountered, though,

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.910
is when stitching these
together, there are a lot

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:22.420
of these breaks with the frame.

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:30.980
So I cleaned up all of these,
but I left these landmark details

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:36.950
and inserted some space
into the map.

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:39.680
And I had to convert it to
grayscale because this became

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:45.060 position:56%
such a massive image file that the
only way for me to pull this off was

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:48.950
to strip out all the colored
data and go grayscale.

00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:56.200
So this is a small
version of the final image,

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.710
which if anyone here
works with digital images,

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:03.390 position:56%
you know that an image that's 64,000
by 20,000 pixels is a monster.

00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:08.610
So this was -- the size is roughly
like 900 megabytes, so that's huge.

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:11.220
It was kind of crippling
my workstation.

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:15.930
Like my GPU was really
struggling to keep up with this.

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:19.070
So I have a background in
exhibit design in museums also,

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:22.450
and in a couple exhibits I worked
on, we used open frameworks

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:29.280 position:56%
and processing to handle interactive
images, and I tried running this

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:32.360
through those programs and
it was just killing them.

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:35.350
And I wasn't sure what to
do, so I asked myself --

00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:38.160
my goal is to keep this
interactive in a way

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:42.770
where the detail wouldn't be lost,
but we could also still have this

00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:44.470
like pulled-out global scope.

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:46.930
So I thought, well how
does Google Maps work?

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:49.410
So I googled it, "how
does Google Maps work?"

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:53.070
And I found this great
framework Leaflet.

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:55.280
It's an open search
JavaScript library

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:59.460
that has really great robust
tutorials and it's very,

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:02.060
very easy and simple to implement.

00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:06.200 position:56%
And through a little more Google-fu,
I found these fantastic [inaudible]

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:12.130
on GitHub that helped me piece
together this non-geographic

00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:13.430
story map.

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:19.220
So Leaflet is intended
specifically for geographic maps,

00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:22.990
for geospatial data abstraction
layers, and I was kind

00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:25.810
of perverting it by using
these non-geographical,

00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:27.400
these raster images.

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:32.410
So I found this one here,
Raster [inaudible] that was key

00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:35.450
in being able to pull this off.

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:37.640
This is maybe the least
dynamic slide that I have,

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:39.380
but maybe the most important.

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:41.700
This is a directory structure.

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:43.100
This is my file tree.

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:47.640
When I -- through Leaflet,
I needed to splice

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:50.770
that big image up into
smaller tiles.

00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:53.480
So here you can see how
the tiles are nested.

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:56.780
This is like the levels and
these are all the thumbnails.

00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:59.040
And each of these is 256 pixels.

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:03.900 position:56%
So we've all had this experience
when we're on a slow data connection

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:07.520
and we're using Google Maps and
we see the little squares pop up

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:09.670
and then they slowly
come into focus.

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:11.040
That map tiling in action.

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:12.740
You're seeing map tiling happening.

00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:16.570
This is what map tiling
looks like on a server.

00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:20.960
So I'm going to step through
these zoom slides and I want you

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:23.060
to pay attention to this
upper left hand corner,

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:25.380
because this is zero,
zero in our coordinates.

00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:27.850
We're going to zoom
in on zero, zero.

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:39.220
So my map had eight layers and we
just zoomed through eight layers.

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:42.960
And my time is up, so I
have to move really quickly.

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:44.820
JavaScript is awesome.

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:46.120
This is one of the reasons why.

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:50.650
You can really simply
implement this map yourself.

00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:52.360
That's all it takes.

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:56.180
I needed help so I asked
the librarian at the LC

00:40:56.180 --> 00:41:00.010
for some background information
on Camille Dry and this map.

00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:02.360
If you haven't used Ask A Librarian
service, I highly recommend it.

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:05.990
Within a week I received several
scanned PDFs that were highlighted,

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:10.120
no less, of the pertinent
information that I needed.

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:13.310
I plugged it into a
JSON file like this,

00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:16.760
and this is the final end result.

00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:22.800
If you want to see it in action,
you can do so at this URL.

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:27.420
If you want the [inaudible], build
this yourself locally, go here,

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:30.570
and I wrote a tutorial on
medium that you can find here.

00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:32.870
Thank you.

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:38.840
&gt;&gt; My name is Bill Ferster.

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:45.040 position:56%
I'm with the University of Virginia
at the -- actually it's hard to say.

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:47.430
It's the Science, Humanities, Arts,

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:51.640
and Humanities Technology
Initiative.

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:56.290
It's kind of a little
thing, but -- .

00:41:56.290 --> 00:41:57.760 position:56%
So anyway, what I've come here today

00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.570
to show you is a tool
called Visualize.

00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:04.110
And Visualize is a tool
that was designed by us

00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:06.250
for use in two different areas.

00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:09.170
One is for teaching classes,

00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:11.860
interactively in a
project-based setting,

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:15.600
pretty much like what
you saw the people doing,

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:18.260
the students earlier in.

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:22.230 position:56%
And also we use it for making
scholarly arguments using historical

00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:24.560
data, using primary
sources, historical data.

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:34.970 position:56%
So basically what it is, is we've
connected a timeline, a story panel,

00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:39.610
and a slippy map all
together and put it in so

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:42.530
that you can actually
make things with it.

00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:46.660
And on top of that map, you can
overlay things on top of it,

00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:48.560
and there are geo reference,
and things like that.

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:51.270
So you can have dots
or things on top of it.

00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:53.340
You can have interactive graphics.

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:57.720
You can have KML files, which are
basically vector overlays on top

00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:01.510
of it, or historic maps, and
that becomes quite useful.

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:07.140 position:56%
So also we've got a variety of other
kinds of tools that you can use

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:08.440
to make your presentation.

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:12.240 position:56%
So you can -- this is a drawing tool
built in, so you can draw things

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:15.600
on it, and then you can do, kind of
pan and zoom maps, and Choropleths,

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:20.810
which are a way of showing data
relationships on top of maps.

00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:24.330
This tool basically
is all web-based,

00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:26.840
and it's very easy to use.

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:29.480
And the idea is instead of
things like [inaudible],

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:32.210
which are very robust tools

00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:34.950
for doing geographic
information system type work,

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:41.580
these are easily used by
humanity scholars or by students.

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:44.880
And the key to our -- the way that
we've set it up is we've tried

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:47.120
to use a very distributed process.

00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:50.470
So I came from UVA.

00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:52.560
We had a place called the
Virginia Center for Digital History

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:57.400 position:56%
that Ed Ayers had started, and we
used to use all databases back then,

00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:01.470
and these very complex [inaudible]
databases, and what really came

00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:05.210
down is humanities scholars
typically have a big table,

00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:09.630
for the most part, and it's X
number of fields about the thing

00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:11.280
and then a whole bunch of events.

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:13.600
And so what we did is said,
well, we don't need all

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:16.860
that complicated database.

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:18.590
Let's try and use a spreadsheet.

00:44:18.590 --> 00:44:21.390 position:56%
And the advantage of using a
spreadsheet is that Google has built

00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:25.120
in all this incredible sharing
techniques within the spreadsheet.

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:29.220 position:56%
And so -- and the spreadsheet is
connected live to the visualization.

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:33.120
They told me actually I
couldn't use the internet,

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:37.220
so I would've actually shown
it live here, but the idea is

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:40.540
that you change one thing on
the spreadsheet and it changes

00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:43.130
on the visualization, and
it's also stored there

00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:48.130
so people have more
autonomy with their data.

00:44:48.130 --> 00:44:51.930
And for classroom use,
it works out quite well.

00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:58.410
Anyway, so it was funded by the
NEH, which funded us in a variety

00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:02.690
of different projects for the
Digital Humanities Project.

00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:07.300
It's free to use and
HTML-based and open source.

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:09.870
And anybody can just look on it.

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:14.680 position:56%
It's www.viseyes.org, and that
brings up a page which has a variety

00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:17.300
of different tools
that we make at Shanti.

00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:19.310
And if you need to get
a hold of me I'm there.

00:45:19.310 --> 00:45:21.610
So thank you.

00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:31.270
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
