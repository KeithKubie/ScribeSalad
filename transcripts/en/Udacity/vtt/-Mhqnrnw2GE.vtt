00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
To see which one of these diagrams has the field lines drawn correctly,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
let's just look through each one and see if we can find any flaws with them.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
These field lines look pretty good. They all point from positive to negative charges.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
But something odd is happening right here.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We notice here that two field lines are actually intersecting.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
What would that mean if we had a particle right here in this electric field?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Well according to this field line, the particle should be pushed this way assuming it's positive.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And according to this field line, it should be pushed this way.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Now we know that at a given location an electric field can only push on a particle

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
in one direction so this case what's pushing on it in two different directions is just nonsense.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We know that this diagram has to be wrong.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And in fact anytime we have a field line diagram like this

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
where two of the lines intersect we've done something wrong.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So we'll keep that in mind when we're looking at the other diagrams.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Now this one looks a little better but it doesn't look like there are any lines

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
that intersect each other so we don't have any contradictions of the field pushing

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
in two different directions at once.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
But there are still some odd things happening in this diagram though.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
In particular, imagine a particle right here.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
If we imagine this particle has a positive charge the field line say

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
that this particle should be pushed in this direction by the electric field.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Well that doesn't seem right.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
This positive charge will be right next to this giant negative charge,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
which would really pull it in, and since this positive charge over here is relatively small,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
we would expect this force to be more like that, pointing towards the negative charge.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Because this negative charge is so big,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
we'd expect these lines showing how positive charges will move

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
to bend more towards the negative charge like this.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
This means this one can't be the right answer either which of course leaves only this answer.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And let's just do a check through to make sure everything makes sense here.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I don't see any lines intersecting each other so we don't have the problem from this one.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And it looks like all the field lines up here bend in towards the giant negative charge

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
like we'd expect them to.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Everything looks in order in this electric field line diagram.

00:01:48.000 --> 99:59:59.000
If you were able to identify this one as the correct diagram, great work.
