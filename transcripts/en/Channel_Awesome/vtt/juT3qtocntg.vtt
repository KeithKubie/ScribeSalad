00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.320
I always said that "Peter Pan" was sort of like every little boy's fantasy.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.320
I mean, think about it. You got pirates, you got flying, you got Indians.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.720
You got far away lands, you got mermaids.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.240
If somehow they worked in cowboys and space men, this movie would be set.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.220
And for what the story is, Disney does it pretty well.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.880
They of course put some changes here and there, but they still get the characteristics of these people down really great.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.260
Pan himself is very cocky and sure of himself, and I have to admit, he is a little bit a product of the times.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.740
Something about that voice and the way he looks, you can definitely tell it was done in the 50s.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.040
-"O' course! That's why I like him." [plays two notes on panflute] "I tell him to the Lost Boys."

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.780
-But he never uses any current catchphrases or anything.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.240
Wendy, once again, is portrayed by Kathryn Beaumont.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.600
Again, sort of taking your bland, typical innocent, and turning into something really entertaining.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.000
-"She's a wonderful nurse, although Father says--"
-"Girls talk too much."

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.660
-"[laughing] Y-yes. Girls talk too--um, hmm? Oh."

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.820
-"Well? Get on with it, girl."
-"Uh, my name is Wendy. Wendy Moira Angela Darling--"

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.220
-"Wendy's enough."
-"...oh."

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.520
-I'm kind of surprised they didn't use her in more films after this.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.940
You got John the geek, and Michael the cute innocent, and they all go off on an adventure to Never Never Land,

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.520
where they never have to grow up.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.320
The Lost Boys are typical delinquents, and the pirates are typical pirates, but what I really love about this movie is Captain Hook.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.460
Again, this is sort of the Captain Hook most people think of when they think of "Peter Pan."

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.740
Threatening, but he's also really, really funny.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.520
Smee, as well, is sort of the definitive Smee.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.460
He wants to be mean-spirited, but he's just too bumbling and nice.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.800
Plus, when you put the two of them together with a crocodile...dude.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.480
This is some of the best slapstick you'll ever see.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:47.160
The timing, the pacing, the expressions--it kills me every single time I watch these scenes.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.920
-"Smee! Smeeeeee!"
[perilous music plays]

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.920
"Smee--"
[bell sound effect]

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.960
[Hook's voice muffles, distorts through water]

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:54.880
[alarm clock sound effect]

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.180
-The romance between Wendy and Peter is just perfect.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.400
It's not overdone; they never actually share a kiss onscreen.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.500
It's very much done like how real little kids fall in love.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.160
The girl often wants him more, and the boy--hmm, doesn't know what the hell to think of it.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.840
Tinkerbell is a nice, bitchy character that also gets her redemption at the end.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.980
And the Indians--they're definitely an archetype of what we thought Native Americans were at that point.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.140
I don't know; it's sort of like the black crows from "Dumbo." I never really found them that insulting.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.400
I thought they were cool.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.220
That song, "What Makes the Red Man Red"?

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.600
I love that song; it still sticks in my head.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:35.740
-"[singing] What made the red man red?
What made the red man red?"

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.980
-"Peter Pan" seems to get the childlike adventure down pretty well.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.120
For little kids, it's pretty gender-neutral.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.060
The girls can get into the romance and the mermaids and the flying and such--

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.620
while the boys can get into the swordfighting, the pirates, and all that good stuff.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.260
The energy is great, the imagination is great.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.840
It's just a good, old-fashioned, fun kid's movie.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.020
It's definitely one of Disney's most biggest trademarks for a reason.
