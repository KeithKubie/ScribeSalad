00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.460
That there is an object in the mirror
that looks like ourselves

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.840
is beyond doubt, but it is not you.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.740
I'm going to call it from now on
your 'other you'.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.880
If you could examine
some of this creature's blood

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.700
then you'd find that the haemoglobin
molecules would be left-handed

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.600
whereas yours are right-handed,
dextro rotary haemoglobin

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.240
is the one that we use,
not the other one.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.860
I wonder if we really know this other
person in the mirror.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.140
Can we for example meet them anywhere in the universe?

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.340
Well, to some degree we can,
even in this theatre.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.840
I want a volunteer now
to come and meet his other self,

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.040
and try and have a
conversation with him.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.000
He has to be a very special volunteer

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.260
because in the first instance
I hope and pray

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.080
that one of you is called Stephen.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.640
A Stephen?
Come along just the fella.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.500
Now you've got to learn this new language,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.340
and the first thing Stephen is that

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.620
your opposite number in the other world

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.800
is going to ask you your name,
and he will ask you in English

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.460
and so if he's been that polite,
the best the least you can do is to

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.420
reply in his language.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.960
So first of all
I want you to learn his language,

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.780
you're going to say your name,
three times, 'Stephen, Stephen, Stephen',

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.560
into that microphone,
would you do that now?

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.260
just just turn to face the... that's it

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.060
"Stephen Stephen Stephen"

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.820
I think I'd spread them out a bit more Stephen

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.380
"Stephen Stephen"

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.860
That's it. Now we'll play back
and try and listen to what the man says.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.780
And this is a translation.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.080
[SPEECH PLAYED BACKWARDS]

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.920
 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.860
Remember it, have a try saying it.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.620
[SPEAKING BACKWARDS]

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.660
Fine, now we'll see how he heard it

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.560
"Stephen Stephen Stephen"

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.860
Didn't he do well?

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.280
[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.100
It's not very difficult to learn this language,

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.940
See if you can manage
something more difficult now Stephen

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.740
and inquire about his state of health.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.700
I'll have a go and then see
if you can do as well.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.740
You want to say to him: "Hello how
are you? Hello how are you?"

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.060
Play it back from me.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.760
[SPEECH PLAYED BACKWARDS]

[SPEAKS BACKWARDS]

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.960
Great game this.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.000
[SPEECH PLAYED BACKWARDS]
Hello how are you? Hello how are you?

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.260
Alright?

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.560
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.700
Would you like to have a try?
Say it forward first twice.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.580
How are you, how are you.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.140
That'll do that's fine it's long enough
to remember, just saying how are you.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.540

[SPEECH PLAYED BACKWARDS]

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.920
Fine, thank you very much Stephen.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.800
