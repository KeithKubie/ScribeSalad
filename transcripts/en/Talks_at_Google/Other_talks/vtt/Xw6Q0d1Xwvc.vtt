FEMALE SPEAKER: And I'm super
excited to introduce to you two

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.760
of our great speakers
who are here today.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.980
And they're going to talk
about net neutrality.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.750
They're going to talk about
the importance of access

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.440
of internet.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.694
The first speaker we have
today is Nikhil Pahwa.

00:00:17.694 --> 00:00:19.110
Thank you, Nikhil,
for joining us.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.410
We're very excited.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.030
Nikhil is a co-founder of the
SaveTheInternet.in coalition,

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.070
which galvanized the support of
over a million Indian citizens

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.760
for net neutrality.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.040
He is also founder of
MediaNama, a tech blog

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.760
about startups in India.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.570
He led the movement to rally the
entire ecosystem of startups,

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.730
IT university professors, and
major uprising of citizens

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.220
to demand net
neutrality and defeat

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.240
zero-rating products in India.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.660
It was a remarkable
citizen effort,

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.080
especially because he
co-led it as a volunteer.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.420
So we're really excited to have
you here and learn from you,

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.240
hear more about the movement.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.884
And we're super
excited and really

00:00:58.884 --> 00:01:00.050
looking forward to the talk.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.090
So thank you for joining us.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.710
Second, we have,
with us, Ritu Sharma,

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.760
who is the co-founder of
Social Media for Nonprofits

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.610
and founder of SDG Nexus.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.390
Ritu spearheads the
efforts of SDG Nexus,

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.070
a multi-stakeholder physical
and digital global development

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.570
platform for leveraging access
to internet from the demand

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.410
and adoption site to accelerate
the implementation of the UN

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.920
sustainable development
goals, SDGs.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.770
She works with various
governments, the UN,

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.430
international NGOs, technology
corporations, World Bank,

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.620
and ICT, for development
coalitions around the world,

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.022
to facilitate adoption
efforts in the global south.

00:01:40.022 --> 00:01:41.480
So thank you, Ritu,
for joining us.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.860
Super excited to have you here.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.865
Let me talk a little bit about
the format of the talk today.

00:01:47.865 --> 00:01:50.340
We'll request Ritu to
kickstart the discussion

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.380
and talk about the
importance of internet

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.950
and why we all
should care about it.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.720
And then we'll request
Nikhil to come up on stage

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.490
and hear, from him, about how he
co-led this remarkable citizen

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.890
effort in India.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.950
And then we'll request both
of you, both Nikhil and Ritu,

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.741
to come back up on stage
for a structured Q&amp;A.

00:02:08.741 --> 00:02:10.199
And then we'll make
sure that we're

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.010
spending at least the last 10
minutes in audience questions.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.700
So with that, let's kickstart.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.430
And Ritu, please come
on up and kickstart

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.732
the discussion and the talk.

00:02:20.732 --> 00:02:22.380
RITU SHARMA: Anamika,
thank you very

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.550
much for hosting and making
this platform available for us

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.480
to come and share educational
information with people that

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.660
work at Google
around the world who

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.290
are just as equally passionate
about access to internet

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.120
as we are.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.400
So thank you for making this
time and this opportunity

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.130
available to us.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.840
And thank you for hosting
us in your brand new campus.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.631
It's the first time
I'm here, so thank you.

00:02:41.631 --> 00:02:42.610
It's beautiful.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.090
What separates me from
a woman my age in India,

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.500
where I grew up, in
Jabalpur, potentially not

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.180
more than 50 miles away
from where I grew up,

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.970
is the access to
opportunities, and many times,

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.700
something as simple as
someone believing in me.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.510
I'm no smarter,
and I'm definitely

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.950
not anymore hardworking,
than that woman who's

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.250
working, potentially, more
than a full-time job of 14

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.800
hours a day in the field.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.540
She's also supporting
her family.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.110
She's supporting her children.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.860
She's cooking and
cleaning, all that

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.660
with a very little
bit that she has

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.330
compared to what I have today.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.330
And interestingly,
what separates

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.180
us is not to my intelligence
or my education,

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.380
it's really my access
to opportunities.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.670
And this is what this
talk is about today.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.030
I came to this
country 16 years ago,

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.250
enabled by my access internet,
to look for and apply

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.970
for colleges in the US.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.990
I applied to 250 colleges.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.530
I got some sort of a
response from about, maybe,

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.460
three to five colleges
that wrote back.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.390
And one, in particular,
one Lakeland College

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.275
in Sheboygan, Wisconsin--
if you know Wisconsin

00:03:52.275 --> 00:03:53.920
or if you know the
US, you know it's

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.030
in the middle of cornfields--
only that college

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.070
was receptive to my request.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.320
I negotiated heavily.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.920
And read that as, I pleaded
extensively for them to give me

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.080
a partial scholarship.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.170
I got a partial
scholarship from them.

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.920
I made a very big
speech with my sister,

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.660
who helped me practice,
on our roof at our home,

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.379
to my dad, a passionate
speech about why

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:22.420
it was important for me
to leave India, and come,

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.300
and make something of myself.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.450
We practiced for days.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.257
And then, one final day,
I said that to my dad,

00:04:28.257 --> 00:04:29.090
that I wanted to go.

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.890
I have admission at a school.

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.250
And I have to be honest, I lied.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.730
I said, I have full scholarship.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.740
And you just need to do a
little bit to get me there.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.210
So the long and short of that
is my dad mortgaged everything

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.790
he had, his scooter, his pension
fund, and a small piece of land

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.660
that we owned.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.580
And I got here.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.430
So I came to this country.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.810
And I arrived, and I
was like, OK, I'm here.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.020
Now what?

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.640
I worked four jobs,
starting at 4:00 AM,

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.430
milking cows in Wisconsin,
because I had lied, to my dad,

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.890
that I had full
scholarship, which I didn't.

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.160
Moved on to attending
school from 8:00 to 6:00.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.780
And 6:00 to 10:00, I worked
at a tech lab at my school,

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.340
where I did all of my homework
and all of my education

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.432
online, because, again,
I didn't have the money.

00:05:20.432 --> 00:05:21.390
So I didn't have books.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.710
So I would spend, in the
evening, 6:00 to 10:00,

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.460
time learning about the
different subject matter.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.690
And I would answer my
questions in my test

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.710
based on the
knowledge I got there.

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.740
And occasionally,
I would also get

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.460
books loaned from my
teacher and my classmates.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.640
And then, after a few
weeks of getting a rhythm,

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:47.160
I learned how to make HTML
websites in that 6:00 to 10:00

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.040
time zone.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.580
And that led to my
next career, which

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.650
is, a couple of months
later, I worked from 10:00 PM

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.870
to 12:00 AM in the morning
at a nearby resort where

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.010
I maintained websites,
just simple HTML changes.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.670
So I worked pretty around the
clock for this opportunity.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:10.360
Of course, human will, my
sheer human will, my passion,

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.640
coming from a family
that supported

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.320
education and basic
understanding of English,

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.930
helped me quite a bit.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.360
But if you see this
thread, internet

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.870
has played a very, very
big role in my being

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.010
here today, from
getting to this country,

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.720
to putting myself through
school without books,

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.420
to getting my very
first opportunity

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.160
to work in website development.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.060
I went on, later, to start
a web development company

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.020
with an offshore development
unit in India and in Romania.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.350
I made websites for small
businesses, Realtors,

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:48.670
and nonprofits but a few years.

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:50.810
And a couple career
iterations later,

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.470
I launched a nonprofit,
Social Media for Nonprofits.

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.290
Social Media for
Nonprofits has served

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:59.350
over 10,000 people in 14
cities in four countries now,

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.020
in helping nonprofits
around the world use

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.800
social media and digital
media to meet their mission,

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.910
to increase awareness of their
work, to raise more funds,

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.860
and also, to advocate
for their causes.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.610
I'm also in the
process of starting

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.020
the next chapter
of my career, where

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.900
I'm working with
several UN agencies,

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.310
with several governments, with
several corporations, and also,

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:26.080
a very strong group of NGOs
on the ground in increasing

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.180
the adoption of internet.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.740
Because if you get internet
into these rural [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.520
and grounds, that is
not enough if people

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.980
don't know how to access
it, interact with it,

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.200
use it for making
positive change.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.200
So that's the next
chapter I have.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.270
And as you can see from this
thread, a lot of my success

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.430
has been enabled by access
to this great resource.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:53.480
Internet has been the
greatest enabler of our times.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.210
It has enabled the
largest hospitality

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:59.060
company in Silicon
Valley, Airbnb,

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.660
which does not own any hotels.

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:04.480
It has enabled the success
of the largest transportation

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.430
company in the world right
now, which owns no fleets.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:11.190
It has enabled the success of
the largest media organization

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:14.740
that doesn't hire journalists,
per se, as a form of media.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.770
And of course, we are at the
campus of Google, which is also

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:19.150
the internet search engine.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:23.580
So as you can see, internet
is a great enabler.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.420
It creates a
frictionless platform

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:29.210
between supplies and demand,
so buyers and sellers.

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:32.970
An open, and unrestricted,
and accessible internet

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:36.720
is crucial for enabling the
greatest number of people

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:40.639
around the world to have this
access to the same opportunity

00:08:40.639 --> 00:08:42.860
that you and I have,
people who are here,

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:46.510
in this room, people who are
watching us in the livecast.

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:50.410
The digital revolution
has two core components.

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:54.030
It taps the underutilized
assets and the access

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:57.290
to open markets which is
enabled through internet.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:00.450
So in the case of Airbnb,
it's enabling people

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:04.400
to use unutilized space and
find people who can use that.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.670
In the case of Uber, it is
taking the underutilized time

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.620
on the car and the
phone to enable that

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.620
between buyers and sellers.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.860
In the case of the
digital south, which

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.920
is where we come
from, which is where

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.530
we are working, in 14
countries, for our pilot

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:24.560
in the next couple of months,
what is the underutilized

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.900
asset there?

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.560
A lot of people don't have
a house that they can rent.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.250
A lot of people don't
have access to a car

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:34.780
that they can use to
partake in the opportunity

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.430
that the internet represents.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:39.590
So how do we take
this resource and use

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:42.580
that to unleash the potential
of people on the ground?

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:46.460
And what I'd like to say is,
as you saw in my example--

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:48.900
and you will reflect
on your own lives--

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.840
what asset that we, each
and every one of us, have

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.280
is a human potential.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.205
So what I foresee happening
is, with the internet,

00:09:56.205 --> 00:09:57.830
through our work that
we're working on,

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:01.710
is to tap the underutilized
potential of people

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:04.700
in the global south who
are incredibly resilient,

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.090
incredibly hardworking.

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:09.190
You cannot argue with their
work ethic, as you can see,

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:12.340
from millions of people that
are working on the ground 14,

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.560
18-hour days--
extreme hard work.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.290
So with that, I
want to say, this

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:20.040
is what the opportunity is for
people in the global south.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.305
And our work together, as
suppliers, as public policy,

00:10:23.305 --> 00:10:27.380
as NGO, is to take this
access to access and access

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.740
to opportunity to
people on the ground

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:33.500
so they can be our future
creators and producers,

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.566
and not just consumers.

00:10:34.566 --> 00:10:36.440
So they're not just
people who are searching.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.150
They're not just people
who are creating content.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.230
They're also people
who are improving

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:44.600
their lives, lifting themselves
and others out of poverty.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.350
With the backdrop
of this, I'd like

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:50.090
to invite my guest, whose
work I'm very inspired by,

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:52.980
to be able to do what he
has led and to inspire

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:56.230
so many people to support
this open, unrestricted, and

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:57.900
accessible internet for all.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.330
So I'd love to invite Nikhil.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.340
Please join us, and share
your background, your vision,

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:06.430
and also, a little bit about the
net neutrality debate in India.

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:08.935
And with that, it's yours.

00:11:08.935 --> 00:11:10.310
NIKHIL PAHWA: So
just to take off

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:12.143
from what you were
talking about, the access

00:11:12.143 --> 00:11:16.160
to opportunity, imagine if
you had only one site to surf

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.080
to choose colleges from.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.580
And imagine if we had
only one or two sites

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.860
to get content from.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.750
So who controls
access to content

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:28.140
and who controls
access to websites

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:29.970
essentially controls
our opportunities,

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:31.876
because they can limit
our opportunities.

00:11:31.876 --> 00:11:34.250
And that's essentially what
the battle for net neutrality

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:36.870
is about.

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:41.220
It's also important to remember,
just as you experienced,

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:41.900
you created.

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:43.800
You created web pages, right?

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.750
So all of us are users.

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:50.200
And we're both creators
and consumers, and not just

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.640
receivers of content
and information.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.430
So it's important
that this entire world

00:11:56.430 --> 00:12:00.840
gets the opportunity to
create content and effectively

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.390
create competition so that
everyone tries to better one

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.210
another.

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:06.100
And that's what takes
the human race forward

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.980
in terms of providing
information, knowledge,

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.057
perspective, products.

00:12:12.057 --> 00:12:13.890
And that's why I think
companies like Google

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:17.760
and people who build
online businesses, who

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:22.790
ship code are essentially people
who are now building the world.

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:26.570
So I think the most important
thing about the internet,

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:30.720
for me, is that it's a
free-roam space, that we

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.910
can go wherever we want.

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:36.310
And often, access-based
businesses--

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:39.000
if you look at TV and
cable TV-- they're

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.720
built around restricting
access and then monetizing

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.200
those restrictions.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.670
So that's essentially
what, we realized,

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:50.590
is happening in India, what
the carriers were trying to do,

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:54.530
that they were trying to
restrict access to information.

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:58.270
You know, India's finally got
the internet growth growing.

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:01.910
In the last one year
alone, one research

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:05.910
tells us that we've added
about 100 million users.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:09.200
I'm coming from a time
when we had about 25 to 30

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.650
to 35 million users.

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:12.210
That's when I started up.

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:15.600
And we've just seen a stupendous
growth over the last four

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.540
years.

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:23.120
So about 25% of India's internet
user base of 400 million users

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.450
has been added in the
last one year alone.

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:27.710
So there are new users
who are coming online

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:30.500
and who are experiencing
the internet.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:35.230
Now, what they get access to
is what effectively defines

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:37.210
the future of the
internet in India,

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:41.920
because they need the same kind
of access that you and I have.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.590
They need the same opportunity
that you and I have.

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:49.320
But that's not what
the carriers want.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.750
As a reporter, as a blogger
who looks at the tech space,

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.690
I've been seeing, over
the last few years,

00:13:55.690 --> 00:14:00.110
about how carriers have been
asking for interconnect charges

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:01.590
from every single website.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:07.270
They want every website that
gets accessed to pay them fees.

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:09.900
And that's dangerous,
because not everything online

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.610
is a business.

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:14.890
I'm sure many of you
contribute to open source.

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:17.799
Many of you write articles
or edit Wikipedia.

00:14:17.799 --> 00:14:18.840
We don't do it for money.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.720
It's not part of our jobs.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.760
But it's something that we
contribute to essentially make

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.750
sure that the space grows.

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:28.910
And so to just look
at the internet

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:32.320
as pure market and
purely as a business

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.860
is extremely dangerous, but
that's how the carriers think.

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:39.000
So what we noticed was that,
when the new government came

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:47.650
into power in India in 2014,
the telecom lobby in India

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:50.050
prepared a five-point
agenda for them to look at.

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:53.810
And part of that agenda
was, for the first time,

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.510
interconnect charges
from internet companies

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:59.280
and, essentially, websites.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.960
And that's when I started
taking this seriously.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:07.220
I mean, I'm someone
who started a blog

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.400
because I love the tech space.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.380
At that point, I
couldn't get a job.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.330
And I built it into a business.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:18.660
So we've all struggled our
way to that opportunity.

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.610
And here are the
carriers, saying, hey,

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:22.442
if you want to
build something, you

00:15:22.442 --> 00:15:24.150
have to come and take
permission from us.

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:27.870
You need to negotiate with us
about how much you'll pay us.

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:34.550
And this push from the
carriers let to a seminar one

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:37.740
on the 5th of April in 2014.

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:41.670
And eventually, towards
the end of the year,

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:46.060
India's largest carrier decided
to carve out internet telephony

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:48.580
and VoIP into a
separate data pack

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:52.090
so people would have
to buy that separately,

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:55.830
which is a net neutrality
violation as far as we see it.

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:57.340
And the regulators
said, you know

00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:00.990
what, we need to create
a policy around this,

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:05.150
so we will have a
consultation process.

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:07.230
When the consultation
paper came out,

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:10.410
it was-- disastrous
is the way I see it,

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:15.310
because it asked whether every
single website in the world

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:17.290
should have to buy a
license to be accessible

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:21.450
in India, about
whether carriers should

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:23.780
be allowed to charge
differently for accessing

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:25.530
separate websites.

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:30.200
And that's an environment which
gives power to the carriers

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.910
and takes away from
the freedom that we

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:34.940
have to build what we want
without thinking about

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.506
whether anyone
will use it or not.

00:16:37.506 --> 00:16:40.540
On the internet, sites
find their own market,

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:42.680
because there's a
market everywhere.

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:46.430
It is a universal, undivided
space, so to speak.

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:49.080
And we saw this push coming in.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:54.700
So what we did was we started
calling up friends for help.

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:57.840
And we have lots of friends
in the internet space.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.250
I write about it.

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:00.600
I have friends who code.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:04.119
I have lawyers who care
about freedom of speech.

00:17:04.119 --> 00:17:07.160
And we've worked on free
speech online over the years.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:11.260
And we built, together,
a loose volunteer group.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.460
There was a tech team
that was building sites.

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:16.960
There was a content team
that was working on informing

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.540
people about what was going on.

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:22.910
And there was a
legal and policy team

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:27.690
that was preparing a submission
to be given to the regulator.

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:32.300
And we saw what happened in
the US, with net neutrality,

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.970
in the case of John Oliver,
the great video that he did.

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:37.620
So we thought, hey, maybe we
should try something similar.

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:39.820
And we contacted a bunch
of stand-up comedians

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:44.565
in India who came in and
built a really funny video.

00:17:44.565 --> 00:17:45.440
They put it together.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.920
They released it.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.120
And all of a sudden,
we made people

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.780
care about net neutrality.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:53.180
Now, remember, this is a
country where people didn't

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:54.710
know what net neutrality meant.

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:57.090
They didn't know why they
should care about it.

00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:58.740
And we made them care.

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:02.000
In 12 days after we launched,
we got a million people

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.260
to email the regulator.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:08.050
That's never happened in
the history of India before.

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:10.480
And the pressure was
put on the government,

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:14.780
on the regulator through
the-- we had, eventually,

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:18.340
by the end if it, about
850 startup founders who

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:21.490
wrote to the regulator
and to the prime minister,

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:23.940
asking him to protect
net neutrality.

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.720
And in a country
where people usually

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:29.170
don't care about these things--
because even with startups,

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:31.270
because I've been looking
at them for a long time,

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:34.150
they tend to react after
the policy is made.

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:36.260
But because of the
information that we shared

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.640
and because of how we made
people understand about how

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:42.000
it would impact
them and the future

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.800
of the internet in India,
they all got involved.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.480
And I think we're at
a moment in history,

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.980
in our country, where we
have a large number of users

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:52.200
coming online.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.900
And it's important for
us to work together

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:59.990
to ensure that the freedom of
access that we've grown up with

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:02.070
is a freedom that they also get.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.290
And it's not just India
where this has to happen.

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:06.210
This has to happen
around the world.

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:08.360
We're seeing instances
where carriers

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:13.010
don't want to be commodity
businesses and deal in data.

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:16.260
One of the carriers, I
remember, he actually said,

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.750
we're moving out of
the data business,

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:21.360
and we're moving into
the internet business.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:22.860
And what that meant
was, they wanted

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.980
to start selling
access to websites

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.150
instead of selling data.

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:32.340
And imagine what that does
for a space where people

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:36.030
like us combine audio,
video, and text,

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:39.580
and create completely new
consumer experiences that give

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:41.710
people reasons to come online.

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:44.780
Imagine if someone started
controlling whether, oh, you're

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:46.980
a video service, so you
have to pay this much,

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:49.120
or, you're an internet
telephony service,

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.440
so you have to buy a license.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.900
Oh, you're just doing text?

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:52.400
OK.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.740
You don't need to pay much.

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:57.240
How does that experience the
future of access in the world?

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.320
And shouldn't every single
personal who comes online

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:05.160
have the same kind of access
to opportunity as we did?

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.540
So that was our fight.

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:11.230
And last month, the
regulator ruled in our favor.

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:12.710
And I think India's
got, possibly,

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:15.280
the strongest net neutrality
regulation in the world right

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.360
now.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:17.860
But for us, the
danger is that this

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:19.240
is only there for two years.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:23.670
The regulator wants to keep the
option open of revisiting this.

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:27.080
So I think that
precedence of openness

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:30.860
and that idea of one internet
for the entire world,

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:34.210
where that isn't fragmented
by either different types

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:35.720
of access with
different carriers

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.120
or by different
countries getting access

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.600
to different types
of sites, I think,

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.540
that oneness that unites the
world, which is the internet,

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:47.560
I think we need to fight
to maintain that now.

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:48.980
RITU SHARMA: Thank
you very much.

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:51.960
What an inspiration,
isn't it, especially,

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.420
to see the number of
people that came together

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:57.340
as they came together
in supporting this

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.830
and getting the
awareness-- so, amazing.

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:00.920
I have a set of questions.

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.961
And then, we'll take
questions from the audience.

00:21:02.961 --> 00:21:05.440
But I will start with
a couple simple ones.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:09.160
And isn't some access
better than no access?

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.400
And this is the most
common criticism

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.890
of what's going on in
India, where it says,

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:17.820
why is it fair for people
who, like us, have access

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:19.610
to internet, access
to technology,

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:23.420
for us to advocate on behalf of
those who have nothing, to have

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:25.580
an all or nothing approach?

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:28.000
NIKHIL PAHWA: So
I think this was

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.820
a point that was made
at the TRAI seminar

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:35.380
as well, saying that it's
impossible for us, for anybody

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:37.890
to understand what
the internet is about.

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:42.070
Because if you're restricted to
accessing only a certain amount

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:44.890
of sites, then, that
limits your understanding

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:46.870
of what you can get.

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:49.460
Search is a great
example of something

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:51.530
that allows people to discover.

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:55.680
And if search keeps people
within a closed group of sites,

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.710
imagine how they would never
be able to discover anything.

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:01.230
So I think what
we're looking at is,

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:04.290
how do we bring more and more
people online and give them

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:04.920
access.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.100
But the question
is, access to what.

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:09.880
And what matters is
access to the entire web.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.100
So we shouldn't
foreclose the options of,

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:15.420
for example, what is called
equal rating from Mozilla,

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:20.050
which is, can we find ways
of subsidizing data costs

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:24.470
or giving people free data so
they can access the entire web.

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:26.930
We shouldn't get stuck
in this false dichotomy

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:29.920
that you need to choose
between universal access

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.220
and net neutrality.

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:35.800
Because there are ways, such as
ad-supported internet access,

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.900
such as what Google's doing
with Wi-Fi at railway stations,

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:42.450
where people essentially get
access to the entire web.

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:47.564
Let's not make them-- let's
not create a new digital divide

00:22:47.564 --> 00:22:49.480
where there will be some
people who get access

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.960
to a limited part and
some people who get access

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:52.957
to everything.

00:22:52.957 --> 00:22:54.790
RITU SHARMA: So to
summarize and make sure--

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:58.120
so this is my experience
as well-- basically, that

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.220
is a false argument
when people say,

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:03.060
well, some access is
better than no access.

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:04.730
So I think what I'd
like to recognize

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:07.920
here is that there's a number
of different things happening

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:09.660
in the world, around the world.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:13.330
It's from all the
major tech providers.

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:14.880
Whether it's
Google, whether it's

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.446
Microsoft, whether
it's Mozilla--

00:23:16.446 --> 00:23:17.820
there are a number
of providers--

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:21.700
everybody is providing options
here and developing options

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:22.220
here.

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:24.470
So I'd like to make sure
people understand, especially

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:26.690
because this is a common
misconception, that there's

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:27.660
a lot happening.

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.100
And we have to let market
do what market does best.

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.505
It's competitive framework,
where there will be options.

00:23:32.505 --> 00:23:36.310
So it's not, when they
say limited access,

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:39.960
if we say no to, say, the
walled garden approach,

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:41.720
that they're going to
be left in the dark.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.860
There are other approaches
being designed and tested,

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:44.810
constantly, around the world.

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:45.450
Is that correct?

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:46.991
NIKHIL PAHWA: So I
think there's also

00:23:46.991 --> 00:23:49.030
one more thing to
remember, what happens

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:50.770
to the cost of open access.

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:51.600
Right?

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:56.680
And who pays for that zero-rated
access to a few sites?

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:59.040
What has been
noticed-- so there's

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:02.300
a study from the Digital
Fuel Monitor in Europe

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:06.120
where they found that countries
where there is zero-rating,

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.320
and zero-rating
hasn't been banned,

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:11.250
and carriers are allowed
to do sponsored data,

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:14.550
that incentive is far greater
to do sponsored data than

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:17.930
to actually lower costs
of universal access.

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:19.620
Even in India, if
you look at it,

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:22.760
sponsored data makes
carriers four times the money

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:25.190
that open access does.

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:27.030
So their incentive
is essentially

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:28.780
to move people to
sponsored data,

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:32.590
to move websites into
the sponsored data packs

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:33.980
and away from the open web.

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:36.760
And cost of the
open web is actually

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:40.210
going to either remain high
or it is going to increase.

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:42.870
Because if you make four
times the money in one product

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:45.050
and you make one
fourth on the other,

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:47.010
then, you're bound
to see the difference

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:49.840
and either push for one or
raise the cost of the other

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.340
to a level where you feel
that you're doing justice

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:53.490
to your own business.

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:55.840
And these are legitimate
business arguments.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:59.380
But we have to look at, where
this is the public good.

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:02.800
And what benefits
people the most?

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.900
What benefits citizens of
every country the most?

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:07.720
Because spectrum is
a public resource

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.850
that's been licensed
to carriers.

00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:12.650
And they shouldn't be allowed
to carve out a private space.

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:14.770
They're not owners,
they're licensees.

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:17.790
And therefore, because
they get limited access

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:20.326
and they are
license oligopolies,

00:25:20.326 --> 00:25:21.700
governments should
have the right

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:25.240
to essentially direct
them which way they go

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.810
and ensure that their
practices are not

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:33.487
discriminatory against
users who want to create.

00:25:33.487 --> 00:25:35.820
RITU SHARMA: So that answers,
actually, my next question

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:36.899
I was going to ask you.

00:25:36.899 --> 00:25:38.690
But in case you haven't
covered everything,

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:41.360
why should a regulator, whether
it's in India or another place,

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.859
get involved in this space?

00:25:43.859 --> 00:25:45.400
So I think you
already answered that.

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.480
But I just wanted to make
sure if there's anything

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.630
else you can add to that.

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:51.040
NIKHIL PAHWA: So I think we've
seen abuse of net neutrality

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.230
in India over many years.

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:56.570
There are several plans which
have violated net neutrality.

00:25:56.570 --> 00:26:03.070
And this was perpetuating--
what is happening now

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:05.470
was that the
carriers wanted to--

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:08.170
because it was a
regulated gray area,

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:13.280
they were pushing for regulation
to legitimize their practices.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:18.932
And that would have opened the
floodgates to essentially what,

00:26:18.932 --> 00:26:20.640
you know, you've even
seen in throttling,

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:23.100
which was the cablization
of the internet,

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:26.200
of creating packs
and creating menus

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.270
of limited access for people.

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:32.280
So that regulatory
consultation which the carriers

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.740
forced upon us
became an opportunity

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:37.130
to ensure that net
neutrality is preserved

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:38.450
and the openness is there.

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:41.990
And I think we need regulation,
because for free markets

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:45.740
to operate and to
flourish online,

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:47.550
you need some amount
of limitations

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:50.270
on the activities of
carriers that allow access

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:52.040
to those free markets.

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.270
RITU SHARMA: Interesting.

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:56.460
In a free market, shouldn't
a carrier or provider,

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:58.960
even a provider like
Google, have the right

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:02.205
to price their products and
services as they see fit?

00:27:02.205 --> 00:27:03.830
NIKHIL PAHWA: I mean,
like I mentioned,

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:05.599
that spectrum is
a public resource.

00:27:05.599 --> 00:27:07.140
And it's a limited
amount of spectrum

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:08.710
that's available to us.

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:12.230
And so governments license
that, because they believe

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:15.540
that private parties
can essentially roll out

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:19.800
infrastructure networks
with a profitable incentive

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:23.260
in a manner that
meets a public good,

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:26.120
not necessarily meets a
private good, in that sense.

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.929
But the rationale behind
it is that governments

00:27:28.929 --> 00:27:30.720
aren't the best people
to build businesses.

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.810
Right?

00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:35.810
But even then, because
not everyone has access

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:38.540
to that spectrum, because
it's either a high price

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:41.480
or there's a choice that the
government makes in terms

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:45.610
of who they give
that license too,

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:49.040
I think we need to have
control so that they don't

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.420
act in a discriminatory manner.

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:52.880
Because you know, like
we were seeing in India,

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.890
if all the carriers
work together,

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:57.760
and they start asking
for the same thing, which

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:02.080
allows for discrimination,
where does a consumer go?

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.700
If you start a
website-- and imagine

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:06.940
if you had to go to
every single carrier

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:11.490
and request him, hey, make my
site accessible to people--

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:15.560
and you had to negotiate a rate
for making a site accessible,

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:17.640
does that really benefit people?

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:18.610
It doesn't.

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:20.570
And so we need
regulation to ensure

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:24.020
that there isn't discriminatory
practice going on.

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:25.020
RITU SHARMA: Wonderful.

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:27.390
How is it different-- just to go
a little bit deeper in there--

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:29.420
how is it different than
the toll-free systems

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:31.100
that we have in America?

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:33.200
That argument has been
made by some people,

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.630
especially in the US.

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:37.330
So help us see, how is it
different than toll-free access

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:37.962
on phones?

00:28:37.962 --> 00:28:38.670
NIKHIL PAHWA: OK.

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:40.253
So the first thing
you need to realize

00:28:40.253 --> 00:28:43.040
is that, in India, it isn't
about the speed of access.

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:45.960
The internet infrastructure
is really poor.

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.900
Almost all of it is mobile.

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:52.010
So we're all dependent on the
mobile carriers for providing

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:53.440
access to the internet.

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:58.080
I would say that, out of about
300 million connections--

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:01.430
315 million, 320 million
connections-- 300 million

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:05.420
are effectively
mobile connections.

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:09.660
Now, toll-free calling is a
support system for businesses,

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:11.720
it isn't the entire business.

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:15.150
Access means that if someone
gets control about how users

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:18.410
access your site,
they're in a position

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:20.916
to then become
discriminatory in nature.

00:29:20.916 --> 00:29:21.810
Right?

00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:24.649
They have that power, and
they can misuse that power.

00:29:24.649 --> 00:29:26.440
Today-- and I think we
have to look at this

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:29.047
in the very long term as well.

00:29:29.047 --> 00:29:30.880
Because the way carriers
usually play this--

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:33.240
and we've seen this,
in India, in the past,

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.270
in case of a separate
ecosystem called

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:37.350
mobile value-added
services-- they

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:39.960
play one company versus another.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:43.670
So they'll tell one company,
we'll offer you this rate.

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:44.846
Come on board.

00:29:44.846 --> 00:29:47.220
And then, the competitor will
be forced to come on board.

00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:48.594
And then, another
competitor will

00:29:48.594 --> 00:29:50.510
be forced to come on board.

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:52.560
And then, who leaves?

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.330
No one blinks
first, because they

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:56.340
have a competitive
disadvantage to leave.

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:58.040
It's the prisoner's dilemma.

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.120
So you get stuck in
a situation where you

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.580
have two separate ecosystems.

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:05.740
And the access is controlled
entirely by the carrier,

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:07.620
so they have
disproportionate power.

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:11.570
So toll-free data isn't
merely a support system.

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:12.742
RITU SHARMA: Oh, I see, yes.

00:30:12.742 --> 00:30:15.200
NIKHIL PAHWA: Whereas toll-free
calling is a support system

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.760
for an existing business.

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:17.990
RITU SHARMA: Well, thank
you for clarifying that.

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:19.830
Quite frankly, even I
did not understand that.

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:20.913
I heard that all the time.

00:30:20.913 --> 00:30:22.790
And I'm like, it
kind of makes sense.

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:24.430
But now, thank you
for explaining that,

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:25.980
because I've heard
this argument a lot.

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:26.960
NIKHIL PAHWA: So think
about it this way.

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.910
Your business wouldn't
exist, or your website

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:32.500
wouldn't exist, if
you hadn't partnered

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:33.810
with a carrier in that case.

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:35.950
But in the case of
toll-free calling,

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:37.890
people can still
walk into your store.

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:38.810
RITU SHARMA: Mm-hmm.

00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:40.770
So it's about the access.

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:44.440
Now, why is an open and
unrestricted internet

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:48.710
access important for the
startup ecosystem in India?

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:52.130
For innovation in India,
ground-up innovation in India?

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:54.160
NIKHIL PAHWA: One of
the things that we've

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:56.299
been hearing for
many years is about,

00:30:56.299 --> 00:30:58.340
when is the next Google
going to come from India.

00:30:58.340 --> 00:30:59.798
And is it going to
come from India?

00:30:59.798 --> 00:31:04.470
Because that's a company
that the world looks up to.

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:08.230
And that's what's happened
in the last few years.

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:09.980
There's a 10,000
Startups program

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:12.560
that's running from NASSCOM.

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.760
The Indian government has
started a Startup India policy.

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:19.120
And the idea is to encourage
entrepreneurs and creators

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:25.960
to build for India, and
also, for Indian startups

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:26.610
to go global.

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:29.640
So there are companies like
Zomato, which bought Urbanspoon

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.550
in the US as well.

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:34.400
Zomato's in, now, 23 countries.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.560
Practo is another
health care startup

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:38.250
which is going global as well.

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:41.560
So we're seeing Indian
startups go global.

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:44.450
The problem is
that, when you don't

00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:48.320
have net neutrality at home,
that initial bit of freedom

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:51.380
that you need to
build a consumer base

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:53.930
and build a business
won't be there.

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:56.830
So what happens to
a startup ecosystem

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:59.200
without net neutrality
is that they shift here,

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.010
to the Bay Area.

00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:04.880
And they move out of India into
more freer markets and more

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.460
freer economies.

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:09.850
So it effectively means
that Indian creators don't

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:12.580
create in India for India.

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:16.710
And that affects from a
public policy perspective.

00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:17.935
It impacts employment.

00:32:17.935 --> 00:32:20.697
It impacts income generation.

00:32:20.697 --> 00:32:22.530
And for startups, it
just means that there's

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:26.090
an additional layer of
friction that gets created.

00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:28.030
And that never helps.

00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:29.280
RITU SHARMA: That's very true.

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.120
And actually, that's
the heart of the work

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.119
that we're trying to do
with several governments

00:32:33.119 --> 00:32:34.210
that we're working on.

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:36.870
And the importance of
that, beyond public policy,

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:39.790
is really, how do we
create opportunity

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:41.970
in different parts of the world.

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:45.010
How do we encourage,
from school system up,

00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:47.500
to create and solve
their own problems?

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:50.380
Because there's a lot of
other implications of that.

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:53.770
One is, poverty and
lack of opportunities

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:56.964
creates a lot of
unstable circumstances.

00:32:56.964 --> 00:32:58.630
If you see, in the
Middle East, you see,

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:01.730
in some of the other places,
a thriving economic system

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:03.480
that can participate
in the global growth,

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:06.830
the digital transformation,
creates an environment

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:08.330
where people don't
have to come here

00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:10.266
or there's no radicalization.

00:33:10.266 --> 00:33:13.880
There's a lot of implications
beyond just innovation.

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:18.580
And people who are dealing
with the problem, who

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:20.430
face the problem on
a day-to-day basis

00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:23.110
are the best-suited for
solving that problem.

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:26.930
It is hard to imagine a problem
that a rural person in India,

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:28.580
or for that matter,
Zambia is going

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:32.700
to have from a Stanford lab
right here, in the Bay Area.

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:35.790
And to be in their place and
create products and solutions

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:38.360
that solve that with the
resources that are available

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:40.280
there-- so the
contextual part of that

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:41.470
is really important too.

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:44.200
And I think that's
enabled by internet access

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.940
in creating products and
services for the local market

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:49.070
versus creating
products from here

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:52.100
and then trying to penetrate
there and scale those.

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:56.475
So there's a great benefit
of creating those ecosystems

00:33:56.475 --> 00:33:57.260
as well.

00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:00.810
NIKHIL PAHWA: And that's the
benefit of creating access.

00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:04.360
And I think one of the problems
that zero-rating does not solve

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:06.440
is creating access.

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.350
So what do we need
for creating access?

00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:11.846
We need lower spectrum costs.

00:34:11.846 --> 00:34:14.199
We need cheaper
right of way access.

00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:20.170
We need, say, carriers
to be incentivized

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:25.370
in terms of just the ability
for getting them support, like,

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:27.429
to the US [INAUDIBLE],
for rolling out

00:34:27.429 --> 00:34:29.570
that infrastructure.

00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:32.929
Zero-rating doesn't grow
the pipe, it splits the pie.

00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:36.969
And that means that
carriers effectively just

00:34:36.969 --> 00:34:42.620
focus on monetizing the scarcity
rather than addressing scarcity

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:44.210
with growth.

00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:47.540
And so we need to
push public policy

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:53.820
towards fiber-optic connectivity
to villages and to small towns.

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:57.400
We need open spectrum available.

00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:00.030
We need products-- I
mean, we need something

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:02.440
like what Google's
trying with Loon,

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:05.340
that brings actual
internet access instead

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:09.520
of just apportioning
existing bandwidth.

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:12.850
RITU SHARMA: So
building on zero-rating,

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:14.460
this is an important part.

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:18.280
What are the implications of
the telecom regulatory authority

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:20.560
of India ban on zero-rating?

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:22.250
Can you explain to
us what just happened

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:24.815
on the 8th of February, just
to continue on that thread?

00:35:24.815 --> 00:35:27.410
NIKHIL PAHWA: Zero-rating
was not banned.

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:29.320
It was, essentially,
differential pricing

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:32.390
that was banned, which means
that carriers aren't allowed

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:36.230
to price access to
individual sites differently,

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:39.400
which means that they can't
charge a certain amount of data

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:43.280
charges for accessing Google
versus another set of data

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:45.620
charges for eBay,
and a different rate

00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:49.100
for accessing Facebook.

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:51.450
And zero-rating was
just one manifestation

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:56.300
of differential pricing, because
zero is also a different price.

00:35:56.300 --> 00:36:03.100
So the regulator has said that
this kind of pricing mechanism

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:06.060
is essentially
discriminatory in nature,

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:08.700
because it discriminates
between sites.

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:12.800
And so they've advocated access
to the internet as a whole,

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.980
because no one site
is the internet.

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:19.960
And they've restricted
carriers, or prevented carriers,

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:24.480
from doing this differential
pricing, including zero-rating.

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:27.370
What they have allowed
is, essentially,

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:29.380
intranet-based services.

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:32.300
So carriers can create
their own services

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:35.290
as long as they don't
replicate web-based services.

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:39.410
And they can then provide
those to their own consumers

00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:40.420
for free.

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:43.540
But I think the regulator's
waiting and watching

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:47.990
on that particular aspect to
see whether they try and mirror

00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:50.860
what's on the web and try and
replace what's on the web.

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:52.894
Because I think
what we've realized

00:36:52.894 --> 00:36:54.310
through the course
of this debate,

00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:58.630
and even the regulator
has, is that the internet

00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:02.399
has to be experienced
in its entirety.

00:37:02.399 --> 00:37:03.940
People need to be
free to go wherever

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.530
they want to go online.

00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:08.900
And that's what brings value
over a longer period of time

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:11.970
instead of just some access.

00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:14.880
RITU SHARMA: The final
question I have is,

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:19.330
with Google, with its scale, and
its resources available to it,

00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:23.310
and the talented workforce that
you have all around the world,

00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:26.800
what can Google do to lead this
conversation from the front?

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:29.190
What can they do to
set the market up?

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:31.900
And they're in a position
with the resources, might,

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:32.980
opportunities.

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:34.950
What can they do to
lead it from the front

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:37.480
and create an open,
unrestricted, and accessible

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:40.371
internet that has
enabled its own success

00:37:40.371 --> 00:37:41.620
and many of its product lines?

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:42.337
What can they do?

00:37:42.337 --> 00:37:44.670
NIKHIL PAHWA: So you know,
one of the things that Google

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:46.710
has done in the
past-- and this is

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:48.580
going to come from a
business perspective,

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:53.110
right-- they helped scale the
e-commerce ecosystem in India

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:55.660
by running shopping
festivals in partnership

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:57.460
with e-commerce companies.

00:37:57.460 --> 00:37:59.290
And e-commerce has
had a great impact

00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:00.860
on bringing people online.

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:03.375
If you do a road
trip to small towns--

00:38:03.375 --> 00:38:05.820
and I do that every
couple of years--

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:08.350
you can see towns changing
in terms of the clothes

00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:12.120
that people are wearing, because
they have access to that stuff.

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:15.980
So I think-- and if you look at
the history of internet access

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:19.890
in India, one site which
brought people online

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:23.300
was naukri.com, because they
could use that to find jobs.

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:24.810
So it's utilities that matter.

00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:27.220
And I think Google
is doing a lot

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:34.550
to encourage the industry
in India to go online.

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:36.300
We need help in
providing access.

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:40.370
So rolling out
Loon is important.

00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:42.850
If we can get Google
Fi, that will be fun.

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:44.610
That will be prevalent.

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:48.730
Remember that most-- mobile
connectivity in India

00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:50.450
is metered.

00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:52.580
And there are data caps
on wireline access.

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:57.830
And there are only 15 million
wireline broadband internet

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:00.180
connections in
India on wireline.

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:05.180
So I think helping public policy
and pushing the government

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:07.740
to improve wireline
access is one.

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:09.630
Because the entire
focus is on mobile,

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:11.500
because that's a quicker win.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:14.980
But if we think very long
term, I think Google needs to--

00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:17.825
and I would really
appreciate it if they could--

00:39:17.825 --> 00:39:22.060
come in and help shape
policy for improving

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:24.670
the quality of access.

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:28.080
Reports on latency,
reports on throttling,

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:29.720
all of that information
would help us

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:31.830
understand what's
actually going on.

00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:34.060
Because people like
me don't have access

00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:38.600
to what's happening
at the network layer.

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:41.490
And I don't think there's
enough data available for us

00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:43.882
to push public policy on that.

00:39:43.882 --> 00:39:45.090
RITU SHARMA: Well, thank you.

00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:48.160
I want to thank all of
you for joining us today.

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:50.180
I want to leave you
inspired and encourage,

00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:52.630
I hope, to be part
of a movement which

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:56.680
makes internet open, accessible,
and unrestricted for all people

00:39:56.680 --> 00:40:00.540
to participate in creation
of wealth and for prosperity,

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:03.710
for finding opportunities,
like I did and you did,

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:06.950
and using this resource
to lift each other

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:09.960
and the vast majority of
this world that still remains

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:12.320
in poverty out of poverty.

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:14.140
I want to thank
our host, Anamika.

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:16.854
Thank you for making this
happen at a very short notice.

00:40:16.854 --> 00:40:19.270
Thank you for providing us the
platform and an opportunity

00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:22.920
to share our perspective
with Google and folks

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:26.190
all over the world, wherever
you are listening to us from.

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:29.240
And what you can do to
partner and support,

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:31.990
I hope you're
inspired to speak up,

00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:34.780
to join the movement wherever
you are in the world,

00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:37.670
to be part of this, and speak
up when you see policies

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:39.675
that anti-competitive,
and be part

00:40:39.675 --> 00:40:40.800
of the movement in general.

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:42.341
So thank you very
much for your time.

00:40:42.341 --> 00:40:44.050
And I will see if
anybody has questions.

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:45.284
But thank you again.

00:40:45.284 --> 00:40:46.950
AUDIENCE: I largely
agree with, I think,

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:50.100
your stance on this kind
of zero-rating generally.

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:52.100
But I am curious-- and I
could be wrong on this,

00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:55.780
but my understanding is
that TRAI decision-- TR--

00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:59.580
the regulatory decision banning
zero-rating-- or differential

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:03.670
pricing, like you say--
also bans Wikipedia Zero.

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:05.170
And what is your
stance on something

00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:08.040
that's so clear-cut, like,
this very bright line that

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:08.960
bans everything?

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:11.880
Do you think that's
necessarily--

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:14.500
I mean, what is your
stance on that, I guess?

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:17.110
NIKHIL PAHWA: So our
stance on Wikipedia Zero

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:21.330
is that Wikipedia is not the
only most beneficial service

00:41:21.330 --> 00:41:22.060
out there.

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:22.560
Right?

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:25.340
So if you look at
the Khan Academy,

00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:27.030
why not the Khan Academy?

00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:30.880
And so the moot question
is, who decides.

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.260
Who decides what's
great and what's not?

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:36.070
And so one of the things that's
come in in the regulation

00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:38.260
is that emergency
services are fine,

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:40.540
because those are necessary.

00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:44.880
And outside of that, there
are hundreds and thousands

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:48.820
of nonprofits who are doing
great work in their own way.

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:51.600
So it's a question of whether
we want to give carriers

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:54.250
disproportionate power.

00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:57.900
Nothing against Wikipedia
Zero, but we also

00:41:57.900 --> 00:41:59.590
don't want a situation
where they're

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:04.400
used to sugarcoat more
harmful ways of zero-rating.

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:06.270
And that's what was
essentially happening

00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:07.720
over a period of time.

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:11.760
We have a clear,
bright-lined regulation now.

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:15.950
And one solution for
this is for Wikipedia

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:19.260
to separate itself
from zero-rating.

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:22.250
So they can do low bandwidth
access to Wikipedia

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:24.220
and give data to people.

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:25.940
Or carriers can give
free data to people.

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:28.810
There are other ways
of providing access

00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:31.220
to the internet as a whole.

00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:32.160
And let people decide.

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:36.689
You've seen what's happening in
Angola with Wikipedia as well.

00:42:36.689 --> 00:42:38.230
I mean, with zero-rated
access, there

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:41.240
are people who are using
it to do file sharing.

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:43.970
So we never know what people
will do with the kind of access

00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:45.000
that they have.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.250
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:48.330
NIKHIL PAHWA: Thanks.

00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:50.850
RITU SHARMA: Any
parting words, Nikhil?

00:42:50.850 --> 00:42:53.580
NIKHIL PAHWA: Well, I just
love what the World Wide Web

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:56.393
Foundation says, which is,
all of the internet for all

00:42:56.393 --> 00:42:58.380
of the people all of the time.

00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:00.200
And I don't think
we should compromise

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:03.390
between any one of
those three phases

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:06.140
and choose one
versus the others.

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:06.850
Thank you.

00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:08.090
RITU SHARMA: Well,
thank you very much.

00:43:08.090 --> 00:43:09.070
I really appreciate it.

00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:10.070
NIKHIL PAHWA: Thank you.

00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:12.720
[APPLAUSE]
