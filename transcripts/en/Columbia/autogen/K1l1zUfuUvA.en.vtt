00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:19.030
since 79 in all kinds of ways and so I
 

00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:21.000
since 79 in all kinds of ways and so I
just feel you left out that whole

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:21.010
just feel you left out that whole
 

00:52:21.010 --> 00:52:24.120
just feel you left out that whole
history and and made the assumption Iran

you are using using the treaty so I'm

you are using using the treaty so I'm

you are using using the treaty so I'm
one of them troubled by that because it

00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:35.950
one of them troubled by that because it
 

00:52:35.950 --> 00:52:38.460
one of them troubled by that because it
seems a second example of what happened

00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:38.470
seems a second example of what happened
 

00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:40.170
seems a second example of what happened
with Iraq has happening with Iran and

00:52:40.170 --> 00:52:40.180
with Iraq has happening with Iran and
 

00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:43.109
with Iraq has happening with Iran and
then there's North Korea and North Korea

00:52:43.109 --> 00:52:43.119
then there's North Korea and North Korea
 

00:52:43.119 --> 00:52:45.720
then there's North Korea and North Korea
if people who specialize in North Korea

00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:45.730
if people who specialize in North Korea
 

00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:48.120
if people who specialize in North Korea
and many of the books show that the US

00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:48.130
and many of the books show that the US
 

00:52:48.130 --> 00:52:52.530
and many of the books show that the US
has has gone back on every commitment

00:52:52.530 --> 00:52:52.540
has has gone back on every commitment
 

00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:55.050
has has gone back on every commitment
that's made to North Korea and that

00:52:55.050 --> 00:52:55.060
that's made to North Korea and that
 

00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:58.320
that's made to North Korea and that
there was exactly they were in with so

00:52:58.320 --> 00:52:58.330
there was exactly they were in with so
 

00:52:58.330 --> 00:52:59.760
there was exactly they were in with so
that there's somehow a whole history

00:52:59.760 --> 00:52:59.770
that there's somehow a whole history
 

00:52:59.770 --> 00:53:01.980
that there's somehow a whole history
with North Korea where is it is in a

00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:01.990
with North Korea where is it is in a
 

00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:03.660

situation there's a nuclear umbrella

00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:05.680
situation there's a nuclear umbrella
 

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:09.510
situation there's a nuclear umbrella
against it from both with the u.s. to

00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.520
against it from both with the u.s. to
 

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:12.450
against it from both with the u.s. to
South Korea into Japan and so it just

00:53:12.450 --> 00:53:12.460
South Korea into Japan and so it just
 

00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:14.430
South Korea into Japan and so it just
seems to fit more in the category of a

00:53:14.430 --> 00:53:14.440
seems to fit more in the category of a
 

00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:16.680
seems to fit more in the category of a
nation that feels itself that threat and

00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:16.690
nation that feels itself that threat and
 

00:53:16.690 --> 00:53:20.190
nation that feels itself that threat and
so I don't understand your examples of

00:53:20.190 --> 00:53:20.200
so I don't understand your examples of
 

00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:23.370
so I don't understand your examples of
the two of them as as you know and as

00:53:23.370 --> 00:53:23.380
the two of them as as you know and as
 

00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:28.650
the two of them as as you know and as
being and so I just after you've been

00:53:28.650 --> 00:53:28.660

00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:30.750

through that incredible experience with
 

00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:34.530
through that incredible experience with
Iraq where this was a a very you know

00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:34.540
Iraq where this was a a very you know
 

00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:36.540
Iraq where this was a a very you know
this was real trouble with what was done

00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:36.550
this was real trouble with what was done
 

00:53:36.550 --> 00:53:38.490
this was real trouble with what was done
with the rack can we learn something

00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:38.500
with the rack can we learn something
 

00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:51.210
with the rack can we learn something
about it so I don't understand perhaps I

00:53:51.210 --> 00:53:51.220
about it so I don't understand perhaps I
 

00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:52.950
about it so I don't understand perhaps I
wasn't sufficiently clear but I thought

00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:52.960
wasn't sufficiently clear but I thought
 

00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:56.220
wasn't sufficiently clear but I thought
I said that the security cause no one

evidence brought against Iran might not
 

00:54:06.370 --> 00:54:09.530
evidence brought against Iran might not
be well-founded but there is enough to

00:54:09.530 --> 00:54:09.540
be well-founded but there is enough to
 

00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:12.930
be well-founded but there is enough to
cause a large number of government be

arrangement for it it may be that such a
 

01:20:06.959 --> 01:20:09.109
arrangement for it it may be that such a
zone will require security guarantees

01:20:09.109 --> 01:20:09.119
zone will require security guarantees
 

01:20:09.119 --> 01:20:11.599
zone will require security guarantees
from the outside certainly we require

01:20:11.599 --> 01:20:11.609
from the outside certainly we require
 

01:20:11.609 --> 01:20:13.250
from the outside certainly we require
guarantees about the access and

01:20:13.250 --> 01:20:13.260
guarantees about the access and
 

01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:15.829
guarantees about the access and
availability to for nuclear fuel for the

availability to for nuclear fuel for the
 

01:20:15.839 --> 01:20:17.959
availability to for nuclear fuel for the
reactors but also security guarantees

01:20:17.959 --> 01:20:17.969
reactors but also security guarantees
 

01:20:17.969 --> 01:20:20.539
reactors but also security guarantees
and they I think Israel already has more

01:20:20.539 --> 01:20:20.549
and they I think Israel already has more
 

01:20:20.549 --> 01:20:22.219

an expert on that question but what I
 

01:21:55.559 --> 01:21:57.979
an expert on that question but what I
hear from many people is that seems that

what should be the solution it's like

01:22:02.810 --> 01:22:02.820
what should be the solution it's like

the Israeli president Palestinians

01:22:04.879 --> 01:22:04.889
the Israeli president Palestinians
 

01:22:04.889 --> 01:22:06.770
the Israeli president Palestinians
people know what should be the solution

01:22:06.770 --> 01:22:06.780
people know what should be the solution
 

01:22:06.780 --> 01:22:08.689
people know what should be the solution
but they can't get that the same thing

01:22:08.689 --> 01:22:08.699
but they can't get that the same thing
 

01:22:08.699 --> 01:22:10.429
but they can't get that the same thing
with a Kashmir is here that they know

01:22:10.429 --> 01:22:10.439
with a Kashmir is here that they know
 

01:22:10.439 --> 01:22:12.889
with a Kashmir is here that they know
where to go and I think the US can play

01:22:12.889 --> 01:22:12.899
where to go and I think the US can play
 

01:22:12.899 --> 01:22:15.229
where to go and I think the US can play
a good role and probably does play a

01:22:15.229 --> 01:22:15.239
a good role and probably does play a
 

01:22:15.239 --> 01:22:17.389
a good role and probably does play a
good role there because the US has

01:22:17.389 --> 01:22:17.399
good role there because the US has
 

01:22:17.399 --> 01:22:20.179
good role there because the US has
established some strategic relation with

01:22:20.179 --> 01:22:20.189
established some strategic relation with
 

01:22:20.189 --> 01:22:22.129
established some strategic relation with
with India and at the same time very

01:22:22.129 --> 01:22:22.139
with India and at the same time very
 

01:22:22.139 --> 01:22:24.020

dependent upon its relationship Pakistan
so I think it's probably one case where

01:22:26.270 --> 01:22:26.280
so I think it's probably one case where
 

01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:30.049
so I think it's probably one case where
the u.s. is helpful I have a question

01:22:30.049 --> 01:22:30.059
the u.s. is helpful I have a question
 

01:22:30.059 --> 01:22:33.649
the u.s. is helpful I have a question
related to that there was when you you

01:22:33.649 --> 01:22:33.659
related to that there was when you you

related to that there was when you you
mentioned how successful the NPT has

01:22:36.049 --> 01:22:36.059

01:22:36.059 --> 01:22:38.239
mentioned how successful the NPT has
been and there are very few nuclear

if a violation of the NPT because the
NPT says that the exchange of Technology

NPT says that the exchange of Technology
 

01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:16.140
NPT says that the exchange of Technology
and the transfer technology should be

Technology the non-member to the NPT so
it was not a violation of this unless

that its credibility this even in
 

01:31:15.679 --> 01:31:17.950
that its credibility this even in

tempted to go for nuclear weapons and
 

01:31:41.619 --> 01:31:45.009

techniques of in my mental sampling is
 

01:35:01.540 --> 01:35:04.820
techniques of in my mental sampling is
very good so the whole system is more

destruction and we were ready to go on
and continue with this but the point is

and continue with this but the point is
 

01:35:37.060 --> 01:35:39.510
and continue with this but the point is
that you it's very hard to prove the

that you it's very hard to prove the
 

01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:42.060
that you it's very hard to prove the
negative and if we were to come to say

01:35:42.060 --> 01:35:42.070
negative and if we were to come to say
 

01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:43.710
negative and if we were to come to say
that we were on balance we don't think

that's not what the inspectors do and
 

01:35:54.340 --> 01:35:56.040
that's not what the inspectors do and
they cannot do any can you should be

01:35:56.040 --> 01:35:56.050
they cannot do any can you should be
 

01:35:56.050 --> 01:35:57.210
they cannot do any can you should be
absolutely sure that's not a little

01:35:57.210 --> 01:35:57.220

we live with this residual and the world

01:36:27.850 --> 01:36:27.860
we live with this residual and the world

we live with this residual and the world
did that does regard South Africa we did

01:36:30.129 --> 01:36:30.139
did that does regard South Africa we did
 

01:36:30.139 --> 01:36:32.020
did that does regard South Africa we did
a very extensive investigation South

01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:32.030
a very extensive investigation South
 

01:36:32.030 --> 01:36:36.160
a very extensive investigation South
Africa and suggested that South Africa

01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:36.170
Africa and suggested that South Africa
 

01:36:36.170 --> 01:36:38.319
Africa and suggested that South Africa
had dismantled everything we didn't say

01:36:38.319 --> 01:36:38.329
had dismantled everything we didn't say
 

01:36:38.329 --> 01:36:40.149
had dismantled everything we didn't say
that is nothing but we said this is what

01:36:40.149 --> 01:36:40.159
that is nothing but we said this is what
 

01:36:40.159 --> 01:36:41.799
that is nothing but we said this is what
we've done and the world has such a

01:36:41.799 --> 01:36:41.809
we've done and the world has such a
 

01:36:41.809 --> 01:36:43.899
we've done and the world has such a
confidence and okay we will act upon

01:36:43.899 --> 01:36:43.909
confidence and okay we will act upon
 

01:36:43.909 --> 01:36:46.899
confidence and okay we will act upon
this we accept we swallow that residual

01:36:46.899 --> 01:36:46.909
this we accept we swallow that residual
 

01:36:46.909 --> 01:36:49.330
this we accept we swallow that residual
and I think that's how it will be in the

01:36:49.330 --> 01:36:49.340
and I think that's how it will be in the
 

01:36:49.340 --> 01:36:51.759
and I think that's how it will be in the
future as well that there will be a

01:36:51.759 --> 01:36:51.769
future as well that there will be a
 

01:36:51.769 --> 01:36:54.790
future as well that there will be a
residual but it still calls for all the

01:36:54.790 --> 01:36:54.800
residual but it still calls for all the
 

01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:58.629
residual but it still calls for all the
possible and reasonable system of

01:36:58.629 --> 01:36:58.639
possible and reasonable system of
 

01:36:58.639 --> 01:37:00.160
possible and reasonable system of
inspection though you have to regard

01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:00.170
inspection though you have to regard
 

01:37:00.170 --> 01:37:01.959
inspection though you have to regard
yourself it's at one risk and those

01:37:01.959 --> 01:37:01.969
yourself it's at one risk and those
 

01:37:01.969 --> 01:37:05.049
yourself it's at one risk and those
false alarms if you have a system of

01:37:05.049 --> 01:37:05.059
false alarms if you have a system of
 

01:37:05.059 --> 01:37:06.790
false alarms if you have a system of
inspection verification that is too

01:37:06.790 --> 01:37:06.800
inspection verification that is too
 

01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:09.069
inspection verification that is too
sensitive you may have false alarms

01:37:09.069 --> 01:37:09.079
sensitive you may have false alarms
 

01:37:09.079 --> 01:37:11.350
sensitive you may have false alarms
coming off and that is also can also be

01:37:11.350 --> 01:37:11.360
coming off and that is also can also be
 

01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:13.720
coming off and that is also can also be
very very troublesome in international

01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:13.730
very very troublesome in international
 

01:37:13.730 --> 01:37:16.209
very very troublesome in international
relations so it's in it's not a simple

01:37:16.209 --> 01:37:16.219
relations so it's in it's not a simple
 

01:37:16.219 --> 01:37:17.799
relations so it's in it's not a simple
problem I'm glad you raised it wasted

01:37:17.799 --> 01:37:17.809
problem I'm glad you raised it wasted
 

01:37:17.809 --> 01:37:19.779
problem I'm glad you raised it wasted
and I think that the world has come a

01:37:19.779 --> 01:37:19.789
and I think that the world has come a
 

01:37:19.789 --> 01:37:21.879
and I think that the world has come a
long way and I don't think you will

01:37:21.879 --> 01:37:21.889
long way and I don't think you will
 

01:37:21.889 --> 01:37:24.339
long way and I don't think you will
stand in the way of of disarmament you

01:37:24.339 --> 01:37:24.349
stand in the way of of disarmament you
 

01:37:24.349 --> 01:37:26.919
stand in the way of of disarmament you
see over we here said that how can you

01:37:26.919 --> 01:37:26.929
see over we here said that how can you
 

01:37:26.929 --> 01:37:28.959
see over we here said that how can you
guarantee that not somewhat somebody

01:37:28.959 --> 01:37:28.969
guarantee that not somewhat somebody
 

01:37:28.969 --> 01:37:30.910
guarantee that not somewhat somebody
will not have some bombs left in some

01:37:30.910 --> 01:37:30.920
will not have some bombs left in some
 

01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:32.979
will not have some bombs left in some
cave somewhere in the world in the

01:37:32.979 --> 01:37:32.989
cave somewhere in the world in the
 

01:37:32.989 --> 01:37:36.850
cave somewhere in the world in the
future well the systems in 20 30 years

01:37:36.850 --> 01:37:36.860
future well the systems in 20 30 years
 

01:37:36.860 --> 01:37:38.529
future well the systems in 20 30 years
from now with even better than our

01:37:38.529 --> 01:37:38.539
from now with even better than our
 

01:37:38.539 --> 01:37:40.479
from now with even better than our
countries will be more open also to

01:37:40.479 --> 01:37:40.489
countries will be more open also to
 

01:37:40.489 --> 01:37:44.950
countries will be more open also to
inspection yet the the world will be

01:37:44.950 --> 01:37:44.960
inspection yet the the world will be
 

01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:46.720
inspection yet the the world will be
different in twenty thirty years time

01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:46.730
different in twenty thirty years time
 

01:37:46.730 --> 01:37:49.359
different in twenty thirty years time
from it is now as I said the world with

01:37:49.359 --> 01:37:49.369
from it is now as I said the world with
 

01:37:49.369 --> 01:37:51.609
from it is now as I said the world with
free of nuclear weapons will not be the

01:37:51.609 --> 01:37:51.619
free of nuclear weapons will not be the
 

01:37:51.619 --> 01:37:53.739
free of nuclear weapons will not be the
world of today - nuclear weapons we will

01:37:53.739 --> 01:37:53.749
world of today - nuclear weapons we will
 

01:37:53.749 --> 01:37:56.319
world of today - nuclear weapons we will
have security systems that have moved

01:37:56.319 --> 01:37:56.329
have security systems that have moved
 

01:37:56.329 --> 01:37:58.689
have security systems that have moved
much forward will be much more it

01:37:58.689 --> 01:37:58.699
much forward will be much more it
 

01:37:58.699 --> 01:38:00.549
much forward will be much more it
dependent upon each other and therefore

01:38:00.549 --> 01:38:00.559
dependent upon each other and therefore
 

01:38:00.559 --> 01:38:02.560
dependent upon each other and therefore
I think that the conclusion that we can

01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:02.570
I think that the conclusion that we can
 

01:38:02.570 --> 01:38:04.509
I think that the conclusion that we can
live with the residual will be less

01:38:04.509 --> 01:38:04.519
live with the residual will be less
 

01:38:04.519 --> 01:38:06.729
live with the residual will be less
difficult than many people to presume

01:38:06.729 --> 01:38:06.739
difficult than many people to presume
 

01:38:06.739 --> 01:38:21.680
difficult than many people to presume
now the one last question lady

this nuclear non-proliferation I'd like
 

01:38:39.210 --> 01:38:41.149
this nuclear non-proliferation I'd like
to ask you essentially question that you

01:38:41.149 --> 01:38:41.159
to ask you essentially question that you
 

01:38:41.159 --> 01:38:43.010
to ask you essentially question that you
asked in your own book which is how can

01:38:43.010 --> 01:38:43.020
asked in your own book which is how can
 

01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:45.200

we make sure that the unilateral actions

01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:45.210
we make sure that the unilateral actions
 

01:38:45.210 --> 01:38:46.850
we make sure that the unilateral actions
of the United States in the Iraq

01:38:46.850 --> 01:38:46.860
of the United States in the Iraq
 

01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:50.330

situation in essence compelling Iran and
 

01:38:52.949 --> 01:38:55.490
situation in essence compelling Iran and

North Korea to hurry up their nuclear

01:39:07.790 --> 01:39:07.800
foreign policy are required to stabilize
 

01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:12.560
foreign policy are required to stabilize
the situation well essentially I I agree

01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:12.570
the situation well essentially I I agree
 

01:39:12.570 --> 01:39:15.050
the situation well essentially I I agree
with the European doctrine which I read

01:39:15.050 --> 01:39:15.060
with the European doctrine which I read
 

01:39:15.060 --> 01:39:19.010
with the European doctrine which I read
to you that you have two countries in

01:39:19.010 --> 01:39:19.020
to you that you have two countries in
 

01:39:19.020 --> 01:39:21.530
to you that you have two countries in
most cases go for nuclear weapons for

01:39:21.530 --> 01:39:21.540
most cases go for nuclear weapons for
 

01:39:21.540 --> 01:39:23.930
most cases go for nuclear weapons for
secure perceived security reasons not in

01:39:23.930 --> 01:39:23.940
secure perceived security reasons not in
 

01:39:23.940 --> 01:39:25.820
secure perceived security reasons not in
there if yeah I'm not sure about Qaddafi

01:39:25.820 --> 01:39:25.830
there if yeah I'm not sure about Qaddafi
 

01:39:25.830 --> 01:39:28.280
there if yeah I'm not sure about Qaddafi
or about Saddam Hussein in this regard

01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:28.290
or about Saddam Hussein in this regard
 

01:39:28.290 --> 01:39:31.220
or about Saddam Hussein in this regard
but in most cases it's it's a perceived

01:39:31.220 --> 01:39:31.230
but in most cases it's it's a perceived
 

01:39:31.230 --> 01:39:34.430
but in most cases it's it's a perceived
security and therefore you have to cater

01:39:34.430 --> 01:39:34.440
security and therefore you have to cater
 

01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:37.879
security and therefore you have to cater
for their security and I think that

01:39:37.879 --> 01:39:37.889
for their security and I think that
 

01:39:37.889 --> 01:39:42.140
for their security and I think that
raising the voice or threatening is is

01:39:42.140 --> 01:39:42.150
raising the voice or threatening is is
 

01:39:42.150 --> 01:39:46.340
raising the voice or threatening is is
not a very helpful inducement yes I mean

01:39:46.340 --> 01:39:46.350
not a very helpful inducement yes I mean
 

01:39:46.350 --> 01:39:48.620
not a very helpful inducement yes I mean
if you have economic sanctions maybe

01:39:48.620 --> 01:39:48.630
if you have economic sanctions maybe
 

01:39:48.630 --> 01:39:50.899
if you have economic sanctions maybe
inducement but if they go too far then

01:39:50.899 --> 01:39:50.909
inducement but if they go too far then
 

01:39:50.909 --> 01:39:53.030
inducement but if they go too far then
maybe had the contrary effect and I

01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:53.040
maybe had the contrary effect and I
 

01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:54.860
maybe had the contrary effect and I
think the discussion about sanctions

01:39:54.860 --> 01:39:54.870
think the discussion about sanctions
 

01:39:54.870 --> 01:39:57.620
think the discussion about sanctions
economic sanctions against Iran very

01:39:57.620 --> 01:39:57.630
economic sanctions against Iran very
 

01:39:57.630 --> 01:40:00.040
economic sanctions against Iran very
telling I mean the public often say

01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:00.050
telling I mean the public often say
 

01:40:00.050 --> 01:40:02.780
telling I mean the public often say
absolutely more so in Europe than in the

01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:02.790
absolutely more so in Europe than in the
 

01:40:02.790 --> 01:40:04.850
absolutely more so in Europe than in the
US than Europe they say well if they

01:40:04.850 --> 01:40:04.860
US than Europe they say well if they
 

01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:06.320
