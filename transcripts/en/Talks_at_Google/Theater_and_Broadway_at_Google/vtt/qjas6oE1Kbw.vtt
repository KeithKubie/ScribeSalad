Mark Douglas is a New

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:25.110

And then the rest--
bring the cast up, too.

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:48.820
I don't want to just
talk to Mark up here.

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:50.861
MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah, we
are not nearly as talented

00:30:50.861 --> 00:30:53.360
as you guys I could do that
thing with the cylinders,

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:56.716
but I just don't feel like it.

00:30:56.716 --> 00:30:58.840
AL SEALES: Yeah, I guess
we should all take a seat.

00:30:58.840 --> 00:30:59.510
That's the idea.

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:01.130
There we go.

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:03.110
So wow, Orion.

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:06.955
You are one of the few
people in the world who

00:31:06.955 --> 00:31:09.607
can do that balancing act
with five cylinders, right?

00:31:09.607 --> 00:31:11.190
ORION GRIFFITHS: One
of the few people

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:13.749
that can do a handstand
on the five cylinders.

00:31:13.749 --> 00:31:16.040
MARK DOUGLAS: He's probably
one of the only people that

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.546
wants to do it.

00:31:17.546 --> 00:31:19.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:22.090
So that kind of like narrows it
down a little bit right there.

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:23.923
ORION GRIFFITHS: It
does a little bit, yeah,

00:31:23.923 --> 00:31:26.763
because nobody else is
stupid enough to do it.

00:31:26.763 --> 00:31:28.096
AL SEALES: You don't have a mic?

00:31:28.096 --> 00:31:30.070
I'll give you one.

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:32.354
ORION GRIFFITHS:
[INAUDIBLE] lean in.

00:31:32.354 --> 00:31:36.309
MARK DOUGLAS: No,
mics for everyone.

00:31:36.309 --> 00:31:38.850
AL SEALES: So before we get into
this, let's go down the line

00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:40.540

introduce yourselves

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:43.882

do with the show.

00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:46.072
Oh, OK, never mind.

00:31:46.072 --> 00:31:48.030

more important than me.

Dean Massey, and I play Pippin.

00:31:50.812 --> 00:31:53.102

can I borrow that?

00:31:53.102 --> 00:31:55.310
My name is Bethany Moore,
and I'm one of the players.

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:57.150
And I understudy Catherine.

00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:58.430
She's the chicken, guys.

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:02.370

name is Ciara Renee.

00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:04.129
And I am playing leading player.

00:32:04.129 --> 00:32:05.920
ORION GRIFFITHS: My
name's Orion Griffiths,

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:07.864
and I really don't
know what I do.

00:32:07.864 --> 00:32:09.280
CIARA RENEE: He's
Rolla Bolla man.

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:10.988
ORION GRIFFITHS: I'm
one of the acrobats.

00:32:10.988 --> 00:32:15.450
And I do acrobatics, and
cylinder stuff in the show.

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:17.610
AL SEALES: So I don't
want to focus on this,

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:18.910
it just amazes me.

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:22.220
The cylinder act, how long
did you train for that?

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:24.792
What's your background
in life in general?

00:32:24.792 --> 00:32:26.500
ORION GRIFFITHS: Uh,
background in life--

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:29.110
that's a good question.

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:33.360
I was born into a family
circus, a small family circus--

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.040
mom and dad, eight kids--

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.784
MARK DOUGLAS: Not the
comic strip, right?

00:32:36.784 --> 00:32:37.700
ORION GRIFFITHS: What?

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.116
MARK DOUGLAS: Not
the comic strip?

00:32:39.116 --> 00:32:41.230
ORION GRIFFITHS:
No, the real deal.

00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:43.110
My world.

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:48.660
Yeah no, I started training
that when I was six years old,

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:51.030
the cylinders thing.

00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:53.154
AL SEALES: So you're
one of how many sibling?

00:32:53.154 --> 00:32:54.570
ORION GRIFFITHS:
I'm one of eight.

00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:56.450
AL SEALES: Wow, and can
they all do handstands?

00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:57.908
ORION GRIFFITHS:
They all can, yes.

00:32:57.908 --> 00:33:00.551
Some are jugglers, handstands,
and tumblers, yeah.

00:33:00.551 --> 00:33:01.533
AL SEALES: Wow.

00:33:01.533 --> 00:33:02.515
ORION GRIFFITHS: Yeah.

00:33:02.515 --> 00:33:04.144
AL SEALES: Well OK, so--

00:33:04.144 --> 00:33:05.810
ORION GRIFFITHS: No
more questions, huh?

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:09.430
AL SEALES: I could talk
about that all day.

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:11.260
So Kyle Dean--

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:12.790
KYLE DEAN MASSEY: Yeah.

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:14.959
AL SEALES: Congratulations
on your now third week

00:33:14.959 --> 00:33:16.500
of performances in
the show, correct?

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.100
KYLE DEAN MASSEY:
Yeah, thank you.

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:21.320
AL SEALES: So this is
obviously a little bit more

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:24.400
of a physically demanding
show than, perhaps, roles

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:24.980
in the past.

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:28.270
Like, what did you have to do,
I guess, to prepare for this?

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:29.160
To addition for it?

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.420
Like, I have no idea
where to start with this.

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:32.810
This show is so different.

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:34.476
KYLE DEAN MASSEY:
Yeah, it is different.

00:33:34.476 --> 00:33:37.810
Well, most times, when you're a
replacement in the show like I

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:39.500
am in the show,
like, they usually

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.460
give you two weeks,
sometimes three

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:43.170
if you're lucky
to learn the role

00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:45.250
and to get put into the show.

00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:49.580
And they gave five weeks with
this show, which I've never

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.290
rehearsed that long
for a replacement.

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:53.790
But we had to do all
kinds of other things.

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:56.930
Like, I had to learn how
to throw knives and do

00:33:56.930 --> 00:34:01.420
a backflip-- which Orion
catches me almost every night--

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:06.020
climbing poles, and doing all
kinds of things that I've never

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:11.667
done before,
playing the guitar--

00:34:11.667 --> 00:34:13.250
AL SEALES: Did you
actually play that?

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:14.124
That was you playing?

00:34:14.124 --> 00:34:16.587
KYLE DEAN MASSEY: Well,
not in that track there.

00:34:16.587 --> 00:34:18.420
That's why we look like
schmucks singing it.

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:19.870
Because we're normally
sitting on the ground, and I

00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:21.161
have a guitar that I'm playing.

00:34:21.161 --> 00:34:23.564
So I'm like, what do
I with my hands now.

00:34:23.564 --> 00:34:26.219
But it was great
because we got some time

00:34:26.219 --> 00:34:28.471
to build up our stamina
and kind of learn

00:34:28.471 --> 00:34:29.679
what it takes to do the show.

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:30.590
But I'm not going to lie.

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:31.969
The first week was really tough.

00:34:31.969 --> 00:34:32.803
It was really tough.

00:34:32.803 --> 00:34:35.010
MARK DOUGLAS: How does that
work with integrating you

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:36.590
into a cast that's
already working.

00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:38.381
I don't know anything
about how this works.

00:34:38.381 --> 00:34:40.650
But I feel like, do
you have to rehearse

00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:42.850
with the cast that's
already doing it?

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:44.054
Or how do you--?

00:34:44.054 --> 00:34:46.179
KYLE DEAN MASSEY: I mean,
they're working at night.

00:34:46.179 --> 00:34:49.449
So I mean, every once in awhile,
the cast will get called in.

00:34:49.449 --> 00:34:52.050
They were very kind to us,
and they called everybody

00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:54.989
in a couple times.

00:34:54.989 --> 00:34:58.120
But most of the time-- Ciara and
I came into the show together.

00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:01.910
So we rehearsed together at a
rehearsal studio with the stage

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:04.510
manager on the stage
when there wasn't a show.

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:06.750
And then they do what
they call put in.

00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:10.100
So it's usually a couple
days before your first show,

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:13.190
where the entire cast is called,
and you run the entire show

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:14.670
from beginning to end.

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:16.215
You're the only
people in costume.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.580
And sometimes you get lights.

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:24.220
Sometimes you get, like, a
drummer, or the full orchestra,

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:26.320
depending on how
fancy they want to be.

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:29.750
But you kind of get a dry run.

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:31.570
So there've been
some shows where

00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:34.675
I haven't met the entire
cast until my put in.

00:35:34.675 --> 00:35:35.550
MARK DOUGLAS: Oh wow.

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:37.716
KYLE DEAN MASSEY: There
have been times where that--

00:35:37.716 --> 00:35:40.320
MARK DOUGLAS: Put in, that
sounds very technical.

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:43.190
Yeah, I mean-- for people
that have not seen this show,

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:44.250
it is incredible.

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:47.170
It was sort of like--
I was telling Ciara

00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:51.700
that when I describe this show,
I sound like that guy Stefon.

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:57.370
Like, this has everything--
talking severed head, fire,

00:35:57.370 --> 00:36:00.480
Annie Potts-- you
know, that thing where

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:03.015
a muscle man gets
on the cylinders?

00:36:03.015 --> 00:36:06.270
But it really does
have everything.

00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:09.390
And I mean, I'm just blown away.

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:12.570
Like, I make YouTube videos,
and I feel like I'm in the arts.

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:16.180
But you guys are bringing it.

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:20.697
And it's amazing because
there's so much to watch.

00:36:20.697 --> 00:36:22.530
You kind of throw down
the gauntlet, saying,

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:23.610
we've got magic to do.

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:25.307
And then you do
it in every form.

00:36:25.307 --> 00:36:26.640
And it's just really incredible.

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.846
If you haven't seen
it, please go see it.

00:36:29.846 --> 00:36:32.054
That feels like the end of
the interview, doesn't it?

00:36:32.054 --> 00:36:33.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:34.960
Thank you, I've got to go.

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.700
I've got OKRs.

00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:40.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:41.670
That wasn't a question.

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:45.210
I just wanted to bow down
to them for a moment.

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:47.471
AL SEALES: So Ciara,
you're also three weeks in.

00:36:47.471 --> 00:36:48.970
You got put in the
same time, right?

00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:50.303
So was your experience the same?

00:36:53.412 --> 00:36:54.370
You see a lot of shows.

00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:57.291
And the leads, they don't
do all of the dancing.

00:36:57.291 --> 00:36:58.790
And they don't do
all of the numbers

00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:01.305
because it's just so physically
demanding night after night.

00:37:01.305 --> 00:37:03.320
But you guys are
doing the acrobatics.

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:06.090
And you're jumping, like,
20 feet off the ground.

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:09.010
Kyle Dean is jumping from
pole, to stage, platform,

00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:12.610
and this stuff, like-- how
was that the first time you

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:14.730
started doing this?

00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:16.510
CIARA RENEE: OK,
well the first thing

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:19.070
they had me do, before I
started any rehearsals,

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:21.040
was to do trapeze.

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.580
They sent me on to
Circus Warehouse,

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:25.840
and they were like, we need to
make sure that you can do this.

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.690
Because, I mean, it's crazy.

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:29.190
I never, in a million
years, thought

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:31.370
that I would be learning
how to do the trapeze.

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:35.630
And at first, it was absolutely
terrifying, and so painful,

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:38.230
and I was like, I
don't want to do it.

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:41.240
But now I absolutely love it.

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:45.506
And I feel like I'm, like, a
quarter cool as you, or maybe

00:37:45.506 --> 00:37:47.070
like an eighteenth,
or something.

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:50.992
But yeah, no, it was
really, really difficult.

00:37:50.992 --> 00:37:52.950
It's probably the hardest
thing I've ever done.

00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:55.710
But it is super, super fun.

00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:57.600
AL SEALES: So you
have no safety net.

00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:58.970
CIARA RENEE: No.

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:00.020
There I am.

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:04.860
That's why I have been working
out every single day because I

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:08.078
want to be able to catch myself
if I fall out of something,

00:38:08.078 --> 00:38:09.272
you know?

00:38:09.272 --> 00:38:10.980
MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah,
it seems like there's

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:14.821
nobody in the cast
who gets off easy.

00:38:14.821 --> 00:38:15.820
Like, I saw Annie Potts.

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:18.236
I was like, OK, they won't
make her get up on the trapeze.

00:38:18.236 --> 00:38:19.360
And then there she is.

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.870
And she's in amazing shape.

00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:24.591
But do you ever make her say,
Ghostbusters, what do you want?

00:38:24.591 --> 00:38:26.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:28.269
CIARA RENEE: I want to, I know.

00:38:28.269 --> 00:38:29.810
MARK DOUGLAS: Is
she cool about that?

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:32.540
ORION GRIFFITHS: I think
she would just leave.

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:33.987
I'm leaving.

00:38:33.987 --> 00:38:36.320
MARK DOUGLAS: So you had never
played the guitar before?

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:39.330
KYLE DEAN MASSEY: I had played,
like, chords and things.

00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:44.950
But playing, and singing,
and acting at the same time

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:46.340
is completely different.

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:48.440
And, like, finger picking
is what I'm doing.

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.240
And so they put me
into guitar lessons.

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:50.990
MARK DOUGLAS: Wow.

00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:53.240
One of the great things I
feel like, probably, for you

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.460
guys is, after this show,
the next thing you do

00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:57.624
will probably be much easier.

00:38:57.624 --> 00:38:59.040
KYLE DEAN MASSEY:
Without a doubt.

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:00.280
MARK DOUGLAS: It was kind
of nice to see you guys

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:03.117
actually sing the songs and
kind of appreciate just the song

00:39:03.117 --> 00:39:04.950
because there's so much
going on behind you.

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:06.324
It's kind of like
a Broadway show

00:39:06.324 --> 00:39:08.440
with a real circus behind it.

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:12.520
But it was really cool to
see you guys kind just, oh,

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:14.461
these songs are
really good, too.

00:39:14.461 --> 00:39:15.710
It's like there's Easter eggs.

00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:18.270
At one point, you did a
magic trick back there

00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:19.702
during the show with the whole--

00:39:19.702 --> 00:39:20.660
KYLE DEAN MASSEY: Yeah.

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:21.425
CIARA RENEE: Who?

00:39:21.425 --> 00:39:22.800
KYLE DEAN MASSEY:
The levitation.

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:24.020
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:24.770
CIARA RENEE: I do.

00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:26.729
MARK DOUGLAS: You
don't even remember.

00:39:26.729 --> 00:39:28.020
CIARA RENEE: My brain is fried.

00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:29.228
All of the magic tricks I do.

00:39:29.228 --> 00:39:29.804
I don't know.

00:39:29.804 --> 00:39:31.970
MARK DOUGLAS: When you go
and audition for something

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:33.330
like this, is it just the song?

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:34.830
Or do they go, OK,
you did the song,

00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:36.849
now do a backflip
and all that stuff?

00:39:36.849 --> 00:39:37.640
Or is it kind of--?

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:38.250
CIARA RENEE: No,
they didn't expect

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:39.740
us to know how to
do those things.

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:41.281
We were really lucky
that they really

00:39:41.281 --> 00:39:43.710
taught us all of the magic
tricks, all of the acrobatics,

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:45.730
all of the dance,
stuff like that.

00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:48.389
I mean, dance was part of
our audition, and the scenes,

00:39:48.389 --> 00:39:49.430
and everything like that.

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:51.031
It was a pretty
standard audition.

00:39:51.031 --> 00:39:53.280
But then, afterwards, they
were like-- the first thing

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.980
you need to start doing
right now trapeze,

00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:56.503
and this, and that,
and this and that,

00:39:56.503 --> 00:39:57.910
all the magic tricks
and stuff like that.

00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:58.110
KYLE DEAN MASSEY:
Yeah, because we

00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:00.250
have circus training every day.

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:03.700
And we still have it for
an hour before the show.

00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:04.560
MARK DOUGLAS: Wow.

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.610
KYLE DEAN MASSEY: And we
have a separate circus

00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:07.604
trainer named Tony.

00:40:07.604 --> 00:40:09.020
CIARA RENEE: Yeah,
Tony Hernandez,

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:12.230
who is really incredible
and takes a lot of time

00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:15.104
with both of us
because we need it.

00:40:15.104 --> 00:40:16.979
MARK DOUGLAS: How's it
working with that dog?

00:40:16.979 --> 00:40:17.937
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:17.937 --> 00:40:21.290
KYLE DEAN MASSEY: That
was another thing.

00:40:21.290 --> 00:40:24.360
Yeah, well that thing is really
like our dog trainer, actually.

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:27.140
BETHANY MOORE: I trained dogs
before I got into theater.

00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:28.272
So that was kind of lucky.

00:40:28.272 --> 00:40:29.730
KYLE DEAN MASSEY:
So random, right?

00:40:29.730 --> 00:40:31.680
BETHANY MOORE: So random.

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:34.320
On our resumes, we put special
skills of the very bottom,

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:37.036
and, like, ballroom dancing,
or something random like that.

00:40:37.036 --> 00:40:40.300
And I put dog show
handling and dog trainer.

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:45.000
And our director, Diane Paulus
said, oh, so you do train dogs?

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.360
Would you mind doing
that on Broadway?

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.850
Well, of course.

00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:49.900
So that was really--

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:50.475
MARK DOUGLAS: And
that got you the part?

00:40:50.475 --> 00:40:51.766
BETHANY MOORE: Well, hopefully.

00:40:51.766 --> 00:40:54.084
CIARA RENEE: That's
the only reason.

00:40:54.084 --> 00:40:54.920
KYLE DEAN MASSEY: Every
little bit helps, right?

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:56.400
BETHANY MOORE: Every
little bit helps, though.

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.690
But yeah, our dog right
now, his name is Barnum.

00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:02.120
Ha, ha, funny, the circus.

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:05.110
And one of the most
fun I've had was

00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:07.850
working with Barnum and
Kyle Dean at the same time

00:41:07.850 --> 00:41:11.590
because they are put
ins for the same show.

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:14.520
So we were training both
of them at the same time.

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:15.160
[LAUGH]

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:17.160
AL SEALES: Do you ever
have to tap on the ground

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:19.330
to get Kyle Dean to go
where he needs to go?

00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:20.639
BETHANY MOORE: Come on, cookie.

00:41:20.639 --> 00:41:22.180
KYLE DEAN MASSEY:
I like treats, too.

00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:23.888
MARK DOUGLAS: He won't
hit that last note

00:41:23.888 --> 00:41:25.420
unless you give
him a little snack.

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:28.045
AL SEALES: So Bethany and Orion,
you guys have been in the show

00:41:28.045 --> 00:41:30.270
since it was-- I can't
say the beginning.

00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:31.950
I mean, the beginning
of the revival.

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:33.450
BETHANY MOORE:
Before the beginning.

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:37.363
The workshops, and Boston,
out of town tryout and--

00:41:37.363 --> 00:41:40.690
AL SEALES: So how did that
process work because I know,

00:41:40.690 --> 00:41:44.292
with new shows, they go through
all the script revisions,

00:41:44.292 --> 00:41:45.750
and the scene
changes, and they cut

00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:47.960
whole numbers, and whole
characters, in some points.

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:51.060
But, like, this was a
well established, I guess,

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:53.870
oiled machine from
the '70s, right?

00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:57.826
So then how did it work
bringing it back this time?

00:41:57.826 --> 00:42:00.260
BETHANY MOORE: Well, I think
the biggest challenge was

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:04.320
to really bring circus,
and the Fosse style,

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:08.570
and the whole story telling
aspect together and really

00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:09.710
making it seamless.

00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:12.850
And I think that is what
the workshops, like, that is

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:14.220
what it was all about.

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:17.090
And the acrobats had
to do Fosse dancing.

00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:21.890
And the Fosse dancers had
to do a little acrobatics.

00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:24.200
Very, very little.

00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:27.740
So it was all about
telling the story.

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:29.230
And it was pushing
the story along

00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:32.400
and Diane Paulus wouldn't let
anything happen on the stage

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:34.591
unless you could answer why.

00:42:34.591 --> 00:42:35.840
Why would you do that there?

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:37.960
Why put the trick there?

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:42.160
And I think that is what
made this show so brilliant,

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:46.620
and seamless, and a
beautiful circus Fosse piece.

00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:49.520
AL SEALES: So there was this
stuff that was tried initially

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:52.594
that eventually got dropped?

00:42:52.594 --> 00:42:55.260
ORION GRIFFITHS: There was a lot
of acrobatics that got dropped.

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:59.320
When I first came to the
show, I got a call to do it.

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:02.740
And I was like, well, yeah,
I'll come, and I came.

00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:04.575
And I showed them
my Rolla Bolla.

00:43:04.575 --> 00:43:05.450
And they had no idea.

00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:06.985
They were like, well,
what's Rolla Bolla?

00:43:06.985 --> 00:43:08.530
And I was like,
well, I'll show you.

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:10.320
And Diane was like,
wow, I don't know

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:11.486
if we can put that in there.

00:43:11.486 --> 00:43:12.640
I was like, just watch.

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:13.860
And she was like, all right,
yeah, that's going in.

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:15.230
That's going in, yeah.

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:19.059
You're going to open the
second act with that.

00:43:19.059 --> 00:43:20.100
And that managed to stay.

00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:22.140
But there was a lot
of acrobatic tricks

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:24.840
that got dropped that didn't
make sense to the show.

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:27.370
Let's say, in
Extraordinary, we used

00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:30.810
to do Russian bar, which is a
bar that goes from one shoulder

00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:32.060
to somebody else's shoulder.

00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:34.980
And somebody stands on it,
and they flip really high.

00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:37.640
But it was taking too much
attention away from the story.

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:39.090
So it just didn't make sense.

00:43:39.090 --> 00:43:43.750
The whole audience would
be, like, whoa, whoa?

00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:48.690
And Pippin would be like--
I didn't make any sense.

00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:50.570
I'm extraordinary, not him.

00:43:53.305 --> 00:43:57.980
So stuff like that had
to be cut, you know?

00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:01.070
MARK DOUGLAS: So, I don't know
if you want to talk about this.

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:05.510
But we heard that you had
an injury during rehearsals.

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:09.090
ORION GRIFFITHS: No,
I never get hurt.

00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:12.720
Yeah, I broke my back.

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:14.739
I snapped it right
through the middle.

00:44:14.739 --> 00:44:16.530
MARK DOUGLAS: Was it
doing the Rolla Bolla?

00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:19.310
ORION GRIFFITHS: No, it was
doing an acrobatic trick.

00:44:19.310 --> 00:44:20.810
We were in the
middle of rehearsing.

00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:23.120
We were doing 12 hour days.

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:25.340
And I was doing
an acrobatic trick

00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:28.050
with another guy,
Yannick, original cast,

00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:31.380
and I was doing like a
back flip off of him.

00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:33.617
And something
happened, [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:33.617 --> 00:44:34.950
And I ended up breaking my back.

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:36.210
And I stood up.

00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:38.850
I was like, oh man,
that didn't feel right.

00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:42.160
And then, like, a few weeks
down the line, I was like, whoa,

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:43.530
this is not getting any better.

00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:45.140
And I started to sweat a lot.

00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:46.559
And then, like,
a month in, I was

00:44:46.559 --> 00:44:48.350
like, oh, I might have
to go to the doctor.

00:44:48.350 --> 00:44:51.710
So I went next month.

00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:53.310
And then it was two months.

00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:54.560
And then I went to the doctor.

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:56.040
And he did the MRI.

00:44:56.040 --> 00:45:00.147
And then I didn't go back to
the MRI for another three weeks.

00:45:00.147 --> 00:45:02.230
And the doctor called me
and was like, hey, you're

00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:02.950
back is broken.

00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:04.094
I was like, huh?

00:45:04.094 --> 00:45:06.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:09.760
It's really funny.

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:12.350
And he was like, you need
to come out the show now

00:45:12.350 --> 00:45:13.520
because it wasn't healing.

00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:14.680
It was moving.

00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:16.930
Every time I do a
big trick, and, yeah,

00:45:16.930 --> 00:45:18.615
it was like [CRUNCHING NOISE].

00:45:18.615 --> 00:45:20.240
MARK DOUGLAS: I hate
when that happens.

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:22.379
ORION GRIFFITHS: Yeah, so
they stuck me in brace,

00:45:22.379 --> 00:45:24.420
and they were like, you're
done, you're finished.

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:26.490
You might never tumble again.

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:28.450
And four months later,
I made a full recovery

00:45:28.450 --> 00:45:30.486
and came back in the show.

00:45:30.486 --> 00:45:31.180
Yeah.

00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:33.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:35.164
Stop it, shut up, stop it.

00:45:35.164 --> 00:45:37.830
AL SEALES: So you said you broke
it doing some tumbling that you

00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:41.447
don't get to do-- or that you
were rehearsing for something

00:45:41.447 --> 00:45:42.530
else, or is it something--

00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:43.440
ORION GRIFFITHS: No,
it was in the show.

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:44.860
It's still in the show.

00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:47.244
AL SEALES: Oh, good.

00:45:47.244 --> 00:45:49.410
MARK DOUGLAS: You do realize
your whole story sounds

00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:52.640
like a superhero
back story, right?

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:55.250
Just saying, when this is
done, you could be Batman.

00:45:55.250 --> 00:45:57.950
ORION GRIFFITHS: OK, that's
what I'm working towards.

00:45:57.950 --> 00:46:01.380
AL SEALES: What else can you do
that we don't see in the show?

00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:04.074
I mean, since you were 8, you
said, you've been training?

00:46:04.074 --> 00:46:04.990
ORION GRIFFITHS: Yeah.

00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:07.530
AL SEALES: So what else--
what's on your resume?

00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:10.052
MARK DOUGLAS: You're not
impressed by the rolly thing?

00:46:10.052 --> 00:46:11.240
What else you got?

00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:13.570
ORION GRIFFITHS: Yeah, what
more do you want me to do?

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:15.220
AL SEALES: I want to see if
you can like work here, maybe.

00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:16.060
I don't know.

00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:18.310
MARK DOUGLAS: I can do this
thing that looks my thumbs

00:46:18.310 --> 00:46:19.694
[INAUDIBLE].

00:46:19.694 --> 00:46:21.110
ORION GRIFFITHS:
Yeah, it's better

00:46:21.110 --> 00:46:24.200
if you never do that again, man.

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:27.160
Um, I can act.

00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:28.550
I think I can act.

00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:29.190
MARK DOUGLAS: You can, I saw it.

00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:30.780
ORION GRIFFITHS: Yeah, I'm
trying to become an actor.

00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:32.780
I switched to
Broadway from circus

00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:35.410
because I wanted to be an actor.

00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:37.134
CIARA RENEE: He's
doing a great job.

00:46:37.134 --> 00:46:38.050
AL SEALES: Yeah, yeah.

00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:40.246
CIARA RENEE: He's
doing a real good job.

00:46:40.246 --> 00:46:42.079
AL SEALES: For you guys
who are on Broadway,

00:46:42.079 --> 00:46:44.700
would you ever consider,
like, a circus career?

00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:46.638
How do you equate?

00:46:46.638 --> 00:46:48.138
CIARA RENEE: You
just heard the man.

00:46:48.138 --> 00:46:50.915
He said he broke his
back, and he kept going.

00:46:50.915 --> 00:46:51.414
No, no.

00:46:51.414 --> 00:46:52.832
That would be the end of me.

00:46:52.832 --> 00:46:57.035
No. [LAUGH] I couldn't imagine.

00:46:57.035 --> 00:46:59.940
AL SEALES: So for
Ryan, for you, I

00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:03.190
would feel like theater is very
transient in itself anyway.

00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:05.730
But, like, circus, I would
feel is even more so.

00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:10.000
Is this, like, the first
regular gig, I guess,

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.710
regular paycheck
that's been coming in?

00:47:11.710 --> 00:47:13.690
ORION GRIFFITHS:
It is, definitely.

00:47:13.690 --> 00:47:18.550
When I first came onto the
show, and that first paycheck

00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:21.770
came through, I was like, whoa.

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:23.390
Whoa!

00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:26.500
Yeah, you know, and I've been
steady on the show for a while

00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:28.210
now, and they want to keep me.

00:47:28.210 --> 00:47:30.696
But it's definitely the most
regular thing I've ever done.

00:47:30.696 --> 00:47:33.070
I've been all around the world
performing with my family,

00:47:33.070 --> 00:47:35.970
but I've been hungry.

00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:38.650
That's a circus
performer's life.

00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:41.039
Going to the doctors
was-- for me to actually

00:47:41.039 --> 00:47:43.330
be able to go to the doctors,
they were like, yeah, go.

00:47:43.330 --> 00:47:44.920
I was like, oh, that's
going to be too expensive.

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:45.340
They are like, no.

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:46.210
It's called covered.

00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:47.245
You've got insurance.

00:47:47.245 --> 00:47:50.020
And I was like, all
right, all right, yeah.

00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:51.304
So I was too afraid to go.

00:47:51.304 --> 00:47:53.470
I would get to the door,
and I'd be waiting for them

00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:54.440
to ask me for money.

00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:55.540
And they would be
like, you can go now.

00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:56.060
I said, what?

00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:56.560
OK.

00:47:59.999 --> 00:48:01.540
MARK DOUGLAS: I
hesitate to ask this,

00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:05.060
but have there been any other
mishaps during performances?

00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:07.330
It seems like a--

00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:09.920
CIARA RENEE: I mean, maybe not
as major as breaking the back.

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:12.754
But every night,
there's something.

00:48:12.754 --> 00:48:13.980
There's always something.

00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:16.612
But that's live theater.

00:48:16.612 --> 00:48:18.820
MARK DOUGLAS: But it doesn't
seem like a regular show

00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:22.340
where-- it looks like there's
zero margin for error.

00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:25.380
I mean there's stuff going on
that you have to walk through.

00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:27.720
I mean, can you go
through what-- I mean,

00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:31.550
what safety precautions are
taken for knife throwing.

00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:32.643
Is that just--

00:48:32.643 --> 00:48:33.360
BETHANY MOORE: Get
out of the way.

00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:34.830
KYLE DEAN MASSEY: Don't
get hit by the knife.

00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:35.260
MARK DOUGLAS: I
mean, is that it?

00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:37.020
I mean, is there a
special suit someone's

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:39.612
wearing that's a little, I mean?

00:48:39.612 --> 00:48:40.516
KYLE DEAN MASSEY: No.

00:48:40.516 --> 00:48:41.164
[LAUGH]

00:48:41.164 --> 00:48:42.330
ORION GRIFFITHS: Shock suit.

00:48:42.330 --> 00:48:43.746
MARK DOUGLAS: No,
but the one lady

00:48:43.746 --> 00:48:45.400
has got on kind of a body suit.

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.290
And I thought maybe
there was chain mail

00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:49.240
in there or something.

00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:50.940
KYLE DEAN MASSEY:
I wear chain mail.

00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:53.310
I actually wear
chain mail, but--

00:48:53.310 --> 00:48:54.097
CIARA RENEE: No.

00:48:54.097 --> 00:48:55.930
MARK DOUGLAS: Wow,
that's pretty incredible.

00:48:55.930 --> 00:48:56.460
BETHANY MOORE: Just move.

00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:57.418
CIARA RENEE: Just move.

00:48:57.418 --> 00:48:57.930
Be aware.

00:48:57.930 --> 00:48:59.804
MARK DOUGLAS: Well, you
were in "Spider-Man."

00:48:59.804 --> 00:49:04.446
Are you kind of ready to be in a
show that's not insane? [LAUGH]

00:49:04.446 --> 00:49:06.810
BETHANY MOORE: Yeah,
well, this actually

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:08.550
feels a little bit more insane.

00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:11.640
We're not flying as
high, but we also

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:15.270
don't have any safety
wires in this show.

00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:17.865
In "Spider-Man," I got to
do some flying at the very,

00:49:17.865 --> 00:49:18.990
very beginning of the show.

00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:21.844
And they released
us, and we float

00:49:21.844 --> 00:49:23.510
over the audience,
and things like that.

00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:25.420
And that was all great.

00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:29.300
But there were like two safety
lines on every single person.

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:31.360
And whenever you do
a flip, when people

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:33.790
are jumping through the air,
there there's no safety net.

00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:35.170
There's no safety wire.

00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:39.000
It is purely dependent
on the people on stage

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.220
and not technical things,
which I like better.

00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:47.120
Especially with this cast,
we all trust each other more

00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:49.940
than any group of people that
I've ever been a part of.

00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:52.570
And whenever you work
together this closely,

00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:55.150
and you know that
you have to be on,

00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:58.340
mentally and physically,
every single night because,

00:49:58.340 --> 00:49:59.846
if you're just a
little bit late,

00:49:59.846 --> 00:50:01.470
there's somebody
flying through the air

00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:05.910
that you could cause an
injury to them or you.

00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:06.784
So yeah.

00:50:06.784 --> 00:50:09.450
MARK DOUGLAS: It's a little more
reliable than a wire sometimes.

00:50:09.450 --> 00:50:10.720
Just that you care.

00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:14.170
BETHANY MOORE: Yeah, what was
it, like a half an inch off,

00:50:14.170 --> 00:50:17.210
then the E-stop, the
emergency stop, would go off.

00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:19.680
So that's why we had Spider-Man
dangling over the audience

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:21.840
a bunch of times.

00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:23.950
We got really used to,
oh, ladies and gentlemen,

00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:25.900
we're going to hold.

00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:28.920
MARK DOUGLAS: Do you think
shows like "Spider-Man"

00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:32.440
kind of upped the ante
for Broadway in general?

00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:35.660
Because watching
the show, I felt

00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:39.435
like, wow, this is
"Pippin" on steroids.

00:50:39.435 --> 00:50:40.310
I mean, I don't know.

00:50:40.310 --> 00:50:42.320
I've never seen a production
of "Pippin" before.

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:44.949
But it felt like this was
like the super-duper version.

00:50:44.949 --> 00:50:46.490
KYLE DEAN MASSEY:
I think that's just

00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:48.156
the general state of
Broadway, honestly.

00:50:48.156 --> 00:50:49.610
I think Broadway
has increasingly

00:50:49.610 --> 00:50:51.450
become more spectacular.

00:50:51.450 --> 00:50:55.590
And people settle down for
longer runs then they used to.

00:50:55.590 --> 00:50:58.930
So they're willing to put more
money into the show to begin.

00:50:58.930 --> 00:51:03.000
But I don't know, I think it's
just the audience expect that.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.320
It's not necessarily Broadway.

00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:05.870
It's just what people want.

00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:09.210
When you're paying that
kind of money to see a show,

00:51:09.210 --> 00:51:11.360
people like to see
their money on stage.

00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:12.140
They do.

00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:16.100
They like to feel
wowed by everything.

00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:18.720
You like for it to
hit everywhere--

00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:21.070
which I think "Pippin" does.

00:51:21.070 --> 00:51:22.220
"Pippin" does very well.

00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:25.859
AL SEALES: So if James Cameron
were to direct "Pippin"--

00:51:25.859 --> 00:51:27.400
BETHANY MOORE:
"Avatar," the musical.

00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:30.155
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:30.155 --> 00:51:33.660
AL SEALES: I can imagine an
Avatar doing the handstand

00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:34.620
on the Rolla Bollas.

00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:36.120
Is that what it's called?

00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:36.620
Yeah.

00:51:39.970 --> 00:51:42.784
So the technology, obviously,
though, has changed, I guess,

00:51:42.784 --> 00:51:43.450
the expectation.

00:51:43.450 --> 00:51:47.360
But "Pippin" is
still, like, I guess--

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:54.130
I didn't feel like the set was--
the technology didn't detract

00:51:54.130 --> 00:51:57.300
from the story because it's
still very simple at heart.

00:51:57.300 --> 00:52:00.415
There was two levels, I
think, at any given time.

00:52:00.415 --> 00:52:01.290
And that's really it.

00:52:01.290 --> 00:52:05.030
And there's no, like, $70
million LCD screens everywhere.

00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:07.920
So the story in
still very solid.

00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:10.660
MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah, it felt
like most of the effects

00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:11.594
were all man made.

00:52:11.594 --> 00:52:13.510
That was what was kind
of refreshing about it.

00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:16.790
It was all based on
just human tricks.

00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:20.877
There was like
magic of every kind.

00:52:20.877 --> 00:52:22.710
Does anybody have any
questions out in the--

00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:24.910
AL SEALES: Oh yeah,
if there's questions,

00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:29.547
please hit the
aisle microphones.

00:52:29.547 --> 00:52:31.130
KYLE DEAN MASSEY:
It's like "Donahue."

00:52:31.130 --> 00:52:32.576
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:32.576 --> 00:52:34.450
MARK DOUGLAS: (FUNNY
ACCENT) Yeah, excuse me?

00:52:34.450 --> 00:52:36.584
The guy in the green shirt?

00:52:36.584 --> 00:52:38.000
AL SEALES: So I
guess this is kind

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.060
of a question for all of you.

00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:42.770
I mean, you do eight
shows a week, right?

00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:45.660
And the show is not
easy, physically.

00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:49.350
How do you keep yourself
from just falling over?

00:52:49.350 --> 00:52:50.761
BETHANY MOORE: Caffeine.

00:52:50.761 --> 00:52:51.760
CIARA RENEE: Adrenaline?

00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:53.782
I don't know.

00:52:53.782 --> 00:52:55.240
KYLE DEAN MASSEY:
I just eat a lot.

00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:56.365
I have to eat a lot.

00:52:56.365 --> 00:52:57.240
I'm not even kidding.

00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:59.769
I mean, I have to eat
so much to not crash.

00:52:59.769 --> 00:53:01.310
Because I don't ever
leave the stage.

00:53:01.310 --> 00:53:06.690
So I have to drink a lot
of water before the act.

00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:10.120
We have water hidden for me
on stage in a couple places.

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:14.820
But, you know, once you're on
there, you can't be like, oh,

00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:17.079
I've got to go to
the bathroom, y'all.

00:53:17.079 --> 00:53:17.953
There's none of that.

00:53:17.953 --> 00:53:19.480
MARK DOUGLAS: Is there
a physical warmup?

00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:21.450
I mean, I know you've
got to warm up your voice

00:53:21.450 --> 00:53:24.137
and hit those
notes, but how long

00:53:24.137 --> 00:53:25.720
do you have to take
to sort of warm up

00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:27.475
your whole instrument before--?

00:53:27.475 --> 00:53:29.850
KYLE DEAN MASSEY: Well, I
mean, we do training every day.

00:53:29.850 --> 00:53:31.055
So yeah.

00:53:31.055 --> 00:53:36.010
ORION GRIFFITHS: Yeah, we
like to be on stage warming up

00:53:36.010 --> 00:53:41.160
a whole hour before,
just to warm up.

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:43.460
But we like to train, too.

00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:46.520
So we like warm up,
and we're training

00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:49.932
as we're warming up, what we
would be doing in the show.

00:53:49.932 --> 00:53:52.140
So it's not like we're just
sitting there stretching.

00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:54.990
We're also doing what we'd be
doing in the show backstage.

00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:57.310
Like running it
before it happens.

00:53:57.310 --> 00:54:01.260
So it's a solid hour every
single day before the show.

00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:03.342
MARK DOUGLAS: It's not
one you can phone in.

00:54:03.342 --> 00:54:05.050
ORION GRIFFITHS: No,
if you don't warm up

00:54:05.050 --> 00:54:07.650
when you're an acrobat, you
just really ruin your body.

00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:10.670
And I think that's something
Kyle Dean is realizing now,

00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:12.932
when you're doing big
tricks every single day--

00:54:12.932 --> 00:54:14.640
KYLE DEAN MASSEY: I've
been taking a bath

00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:16.300
almost every night.

00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:18.430
In Epsom salt.

00:54:18.430 --> 00:54:22.750
I wake up every day,
and I'm like, oh my god.

00:54:22.750 --> 00:54:27.110
MARK DOUGLAS: Is there a tour of
the show that's happening yet?

00:54:27.110 --> 00:54:29.870
KYLE DEAN MASSEY: Yeah,
it's going out in September.

00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:30.745
Is that right, Heath?

00:54:30.745 --> 00:54:33.240
It begins in September.

00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:34.770
It's a national tour.

00:54:34.770 --> 00:54:37.710
And it's booked in
several cities already.

00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:39.460
I don't know how many
cities it's actually

00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:41.501
been revealed in yet, so
I don't think I can say.

00:54:41.501 --> 00:54:43.655
But yeah, it's a
full national tour.

00:54:43.655 --> 00:54:45.071
MARK DOUGLAS: Are
they going to be

00:54:45.071 --> 00:54:46.920
able to do all of the
bells and whistles

00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:48.340
and travel that around?

00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:49.690
KYLE DEAN MASSEY: Yes.

00:54:49.690 --> 00:54:51.012
Yeah.

00:54:51.012 --> 00:54:52.470
AL SEALES: I mean,
Cirque du Soleil

00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:53.761
sets up a tent in parking lots.

00:54:53.761 --> 00:54:54.970
So this is--

00:54:54.970 --> 00:54:55.980
MARK DOUGLAS: I know,
but I'm having trouble

00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:57.063
getting my head around it.

00:54:57.063 --> 00:54:59.730
There's fire in this show.

00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:01.100
AL SEALES: Fire doesn't travel.

00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:03.714
MARK DOUGLAS: I don't know.

00:55:03.714 --> 00:55:05.880
Do you have to have a guy
with an extinguisher there

00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:07.600
are at all times?

00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:08.925
ORION GRIFFITHS: We do.

00:55:08.925 --> 00:55:10.550
Actually, it's really
funny because you

00:55:10.550 --> 00:55:11.383
said there was fire.

00:55:11.383 --> 00:55:12.794
Just the other night--

00:55:12.794 --> 00:55:15.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:19.170
Two nights ago, the
wicks on the fire

00:55:19.170 --> 00:55:20.900
torches, you're
got to change them

00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:24.060
every week-- more
like every two weeks

00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:26.030
because they burn
down very quickly.

00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:27.680
And they wont hold the fuel.

00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:30.290
So the fuel will flick off,
and get you in the eye,

00:55:30.290 --> 00:55:31.200
and it's hot.

00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:32.241
And you're juggling fire.

00:55:32.241 --> 00:55:34.736
You're like [IN DISCOMFORT]
just dripping.

00:55:34.736 --> 00:55:36.860
And the other night, I had
one of the fire torches.

00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:39.550
And the wicks had burned
down a little too much.

00:55:39.550 --> 00:55:41.140
And it swiped from my leg.

00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:43.240
And my leg caught
on fire right here.

00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:44.570
Lucky, lucky--

00:55:44.570 --> 00:55:46.278
AL SEALES: And you
are not wearing pants.

00:55:46.278 --> 00:55:48.250
ORION GRIFFITHS: No.

00:55:48.250 --> 00:55:51.880
Lucky, my left side was
toward the audience.

00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:53.630
So all my hair was [WHOOSH].

00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:58.876
And I was just like--
nobody noticed.

00:55:58.876 --> 00:56:00.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:02.360
Just carried on with show.

00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:05.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:08.380
AL SEALES: So Ciara,
you, much like Pippin,

00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:10.310
are fresh out of college.

00:56:10.310 --> 00:56:12.530
This is your second
Broadway show, correct?

00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:14.150
Right?

00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:17.090
So you were in "Big
Fish," and then now you're

00:56:17.090 --> 00:56:19.960
the ringleader in "Pippin."

00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:22.960
So I hope you stay in
the show for many years,

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:24.210
and as long as you would like.

00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:26.310
But next in your career, what
do you see yourself-- like, what

00:56:26.310 --> 00:56:27.710
is your meaty role
that you would

00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:29.630
like to just sink
your teeth into?

00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:33.480
CIARA RENEE: Oh, I mean, I
want to do a lot of things.

00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:38.220
I've always said that
alpha buzz-- like that's

00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:39.090
a dream of mine.

00:56:39.090 --> 00:56:40.120
It is.

00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:41.856
Call me corny, whatever.

00:56:41.856 --> 00:56:42.356
It is.

00:56:42.356 --> 00:56:43.022
I want to do it.

00:56:43.022 --> 00:56:45.540
I want to be green and fly.

00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:49.990
No, but I mean, I kind
of got a slight taste

00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:52.280
of originating with "Big Fish."

00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:54.656
I mean, I was late into the
project, so a lot of things

00:56:54.656 --> 00:56:55.530
had already been set.

00:56:55.530 --> 00:56:59.550
But I still had a lot of freedom
to kind of work around that.

00:56:59.550 --> 00:57:02.590
But I would really
like to start working

00:57:02.590 --> 00:57:06.634
on more regional projects
and be with something

00:57:06.634 --> 00:57:07.550
the whole way through.

00:57:07.550 --> 00:57:11.160
And I'm actually working
on a workshop now.

00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:13.569
And I like that.

00:57:13.569 --> 00:57:15.360
I like being a part of
the creative process

00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:18.880
and being a part of the family
from the very beginning.

00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:21.960
I mean, it's so amazing
stepping into this group

00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:24.530
because they've been so
amazing, and so open,

00:57:24.530 --> 00:57:27.200
and it's just a
great mix of people,

00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:30.149
with the acrobats and
the theater people

00:57:30.149 --> 00:57:31.940
because we're from
totally different worlds

00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:32.990
but also very similar.

00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:33.860
We have so much in common.

00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:34.515
AL SEALES: Everybody get along?

00:57:34.515 --> 00:57:36.460
CIARA RENEE: I mean,
that's the thing.

00:57:36.460 --> 00:57:37.054
We really do.

00:57:37.054 --> 00:57:38.970
There's always going to
be drama and whatever.

00:57:38.970 --> 00:57:39.511
We're humans.

00:57:39.511 --> 00:57:41.930
But it's really very chill.

00:57:41.930 --> 00:57:45.550
And it was really awesome
to step into this group

00:57:45.550 --> 00:57:48.130
and it be so warm and open.

00:57:48.130 --> 00:57:52.190
But it would also be really
great to be there doing it

00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:54.160
from the beginning
and really creating

00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:55.440
with a group of people.

00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:58.666
So hopefully,
that's what's next.

00:57:58.666 --> 00:58:01.174
MARK DOUGLAS: It'd be nice to
see you play somebody nice.

00:58:01.174 --> 00:58:02.715
CIARA RENEE: That
would be nice, too.

00:58:02.715 --> 00:58:03.215
You know?

00:58:03.215 --> 00:58:04.110
Yeah.

00:58:04.110 --> 00:58:05.225
MARK DOUGLAS: I was
ready to be scared of you

00:58:05.225 --> 00:58:06.370
because you were
really scary up there.

00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:07.203
CIARA RENEE: I know.

00:58:07.203 --> 00:58:11.170
I've been a scary witch,
and now I'm a scary MC.

00:58:11.170 --> 00:58:12.910
I don't know--

00:58:12.910 --> 00:58:15.640
MARK DOUGLAS: A lot of the
logic of this play almost

00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:18.070
feels like it's kind of taking
place in a dream, in a way.

00:58:18.070 --> 00:58:22.300
There's things that kind
of-- spoiler alert--

00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:25.860
you stab your father, and
then he comes back to life.

00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:28.800
Is there a challenge of
how do you play this?

00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:30.130
Do you play this really real?

00:58:30.130 --> 00:58:31.670
Or do you play it--

00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:33.870
KYLE DEAN MASSEY: Yes, 100%.

00:58:33.870 --> 00:58:36.390
I'm not even kidding, I dream
about it almost every night

00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:37.210
still.

00:58:37.210 --> 00:58:39.220
Like, what is
happening in the scene?

00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:39.870
What do I--?

00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:43.380
Because the premise
of the show is

00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:46.140
that we are performers
of a circus troupe.

00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:49.890
And we're putting on the show
"Pippin" for you tonight.

00:58:49.890 --> 00:58:52.960
And I am a character playing
Pippin in the show of "Pippin."

00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:54.460
So there are many
times where you're

00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:57.070
like-- am I really Pippin?

00:58:57.070 --> 00:58:59.140
Or am I this dude
playing Pippin.

00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:01.040
And does Pippin feel this?

00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:02.910
Or does the dude playing
Pippin feel this?

00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:04.070
Do you know what I mean?

00:59:04.070 --> 00:59:08.170
And you're like-- it's hurting
my head to even think about it.

00:59:08.170 --> 00:59:12.080
I've figured it out in
moments, but it gives you

00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:16.740
a lot of, I guess, kind
of freedom to kind of just

00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:17.990
do it differently every night.

00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:18.760
MARK DOUGLAS: I'm sure
the director probably

00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:19.740
helps a little bit.

00:59:19.740 --> 00:59:20.620
KYLE DEAN MASSEY: No.

00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:21.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:25.430
No, because it's a very
individualistic kind of thing.

00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:27.749
I think we've all found
our own things there.

00:59:27.749 --> 00:59:30.040
And it's not something that
someone can tell you, well,

00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:32.400
that's what it is
because they don't know.

00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:34.530
The people that
wrote it don't know.

00:59:34.530 --> 00:59:36.010
And I think the
people that watch

00:59:36.010 --> 00:59:38.680
the show have their own
personal idea of what

00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:39.980
happens with the show.

00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:41.700
And that's what we're going for.

00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:42.480
MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah,
it does have a kind

00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:44.300
of open campus
sort of feel to it.

00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:46.025
It could be so many
different things.

00:59:48.404 --> 00:59:50.070
AL SEALES: We have a
question over here.

00:59:50.070 --> 00:59:50.680
Yes.

00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:51.306
Hi.

00:59:51.306 --> 00:59:52.930
AUDIENCE: I was just
wondering-- do you

00:59:52.930 --> 00:59:56.120
guys have any kind
of stories that you

00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:57.800
go back to that are
like, oh, do you

00:59:57.800 --> 00:59:59.000
guys remember that one time?

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.530
That all the cast remembers.

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:03.140
Like, oh that one time that
everything was crazy backstage.

01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:04.660
Or somebody changed
something up,

01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:07.250
and it was totally hilarious--

01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:10.570
BETHANY MOORE:
Andrew [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:10.570 --> 01:00:12.859
ORION GRIFFITHS: The
curtain was a bust.

01:00:12.859 --> 01:00:14.400
In the beginning of
the show, there's

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.900
a big curtain that comes down.

01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:20.440
And when we were first
starting the show, way back

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:23.190
in Cambridge,
there was something

01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:25.280
wrong with the mechanics
of the curtain.

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:28.590
So we'd all be in the background
getting pumped up, you know,

01:00:28.590 --> 01:00:32.680
hitting each other--
that's what acrobats do--

01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:35.432
pumping each other up, getting
in our big acrobatic tricks.

01:00:35.432 --> 01:00:37.140
And then the curtain
is supposed to drop.

01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:38.540
And it just doesn't drop.

01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:42.627
And we're all like--
stuck, for like a minute.

01:00:42.627 --> 01:00:43.460
And it doesn't drop.

01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:45.420
And everybody is
just like backstage,

01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:51.045
and it happened three times in
the first week of performances.

01:00:51.045 --> 01:00:53.170
So every night, we were,
like, is it going to drop?

01:00:53.170 --> 01:00:53.910
Is it going to drop?

01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:54.240
Is it going to drop?

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:54.450
And then it drops.

01:00:54.450 --> 01:00:55.640
And we're like, yeah!

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:59.265
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:59.265 --> 01:01:00.640
BETHANY MOORE: Oh
god, I'm trying

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:04.140
to remember a good one to tell.

01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:05.765
MARK DOUGLAS: Well,
that was good.

01:01:05.765 --> 01:01:06.350
BETHANY MOORE: That
was a really good one.

01:01:06.350 --> 01:01:06.410
AL SEALES: That was good.

01:01:06.410 --> 01:01:07.931
Got another one?

01:01:07.931 --> 01:01:08.430
Yeah.

01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:10.054
AUDIENCE: I was
particularly interested

01:01:10.054 --> 01:01:11.740
by you talking
about how individual

01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:14.440
and experienced playing
each of characters are.

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:17.100
And I always thought that
was very interesting,

01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:19.840
specifically, when you
are not the original cast

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:21.440
of a certain character
because there

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:23.370
might be certain jokes,
or tellings of jokes

01:01:23.370 --> 01:01:25.934
that people come to anticipate,
they come to expect.

01:01:25.934 --> 01:01:27.100
I have tickets for "Pippin."

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:28.016
I haven't seen it yet.

01:01:28.016 --> 01:01:32.300
But from experience,
for example, in "Wicked"

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:38.250
there are certain lines
that you come to expect.

01:01:38.250 --> 01:01:39.850
So I'm wondering
how much influence

01:01:39.850 --> 01:01:42.500
do you feel from previous
performances of it,

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:46.140
if that performance was 30
years ago or two weeks ago,

01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:47.031
that affects you?

01:01:47.031 --> 01:01:48.530
Or how much of it
is just, I'm going

01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:50.810
to do it the way
I want to do it.

01:01:50.810 --> 01:01:52.976
KYLE DEAN MASSEY: I think
that's the nature of being

01:01:52.976 --> 01:01:55.610
a replacement is
that, a lot of times,

01:01:55.610 --> 01:01:58.630
where other people have had
workshops, and readings,

01:01:58.630 --> 01:02:01.180
and out of town
tryouts, and previews,

01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:03.770
and all that sort of thing to
kind of hone your performance,

01:02:03.770 --> 01:02:07.480
when you are a replacement, you
are kind of put into the show.

01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:10.870
And you go, and it's
kind of like we are still

01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:13.102
in our own previews.

01:02:13.102 --> 01:02:15.560
So there are lots of things
we're like, OK, that's working.

01:02:17.664 --> 01:02:19.080
That can work for
me, so I'm going

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:21.350
to use that because I
know that is working.

01:02:21.350 --> 01:02:24.790
But I think Ciara and
I, with every show,

01:02:24.790 --> 01:02:28.960
we're already finding
what's working for us.

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:33.170
And there are certain things
that we do that "land" better,

01:02:33.170 --> 01:02:36.150
or land at all, that are
different than the people we

01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:36.740
replaced.

01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:38.740
And there are things
that they will always

01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:40.160
do better than we did.

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:42.230
And so sometimes
you abandon that.

01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:44.690
And you're like, well,
why do I need that laugh?

01:02:44.690 --> 01:02:46.070
I don't need that laugh.

01:02:46.070 --> 01:02:48.460
Who said that part
was funny ever?

01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:51.340
You can let some
of those things go.

01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:54.129
But yeah, it's tricky.

01:02:54.129 --> 01:02:55.920
Because we watched the
show for many weeks.

01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:58.300
So we had those
things in our head.

01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:00.570
So part of it is
just kind of letting

01:03:00.570 --> 01:03:02.485
yourself be free
once you get onstage.

01:03:02.485 --> 01:03:04.610
Because the audience is
very important in the show.

01:03:04.610 --> 01:03:07.080
CIARA RENEE: And I mean, I
think, at the very beginning,

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:10.990
watching it, and getting that
framework, and kind of trying

01:03:10.990 --> 01:03:13.490
out those things that they do,
those certain line readings,

01:03:13.490 --> 01:03:16.650
or whatever, trying them
out, seeing how they fit,

01:03:16.650 --> 01:03:18.500
understanding why
they do it that way.

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:22.250
And then the more you
do it, the more you

01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:24.970
get into the character you're
living in the life of the show,

01:03:24.970 --> 01:03:27.140
then you start to
make your own choices.

01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:29.180
I mean, I don't necessarily
sit down and think,

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:30.670
OK, I'm going to
put the emphasis

01:03:30.670 --> 01:03:32.080
on this word, or that word.

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:33.921
I mean, you just kind
of, whatever comes out

01:03:33.921 --> 01:03:36.170
of your mouth, whatever
happens, you know what I mean.

01:03:36.170 --> 01:03:37.794
And whatever you're
feeling that night.

01:03:37.794 --> 01:03:41.600
And I found a lot of
things in the first week

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:44.280
that were like, oh, you can't
really do that differently

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:46.860
because it didn't work at all.

01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:50.390
So now, something I do the same
as Patina, and some things I

01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:52.139
do completely different.

01:03:52.139 --> 01:03:53.680
And I'm finding new
things every day.

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:55.440
So, yeah.

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:59.060
AL SEALES: We've got
a question over here.

01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:04.347
AUDIENCE: Do you ever get
nervous before the show

01:04:04.347 --> 01:04:05.180
starts, or anything?

01:04:08.126 --> 01:04:09.500
CIARA RENEE: As
a general rule, I

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:11.990
feel like I don't
get very nervous

01:04:11.990 --> 01:04:16.900
because my motto to myself
is, if you're prepared,

01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:18.980
there's no reason to be nervous.

01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:21.880
And so I just try
to live by that.

01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:25.260
However, for this show,
because it is definitely

01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:28.220
the biggest thing I've ever
done thus far in my life,

01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:31.530
I thought I was going to
throw up on our first night.

01:04:31.530 --> 01:04:34.230
I have never been that
nervous ever, ever,

01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:36.530
ever because
there's just so much

01:04:36.530 --> 01:04:38.170
flying by you at all times.

01:04:38.170 --> 01:04:39.760
And you have to be super aware.

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:41.790
Because it is super
dangerous if you mess up.

01:04:41.790 --> 01:04:43.620
I mean, you don't
want to do that.

01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:47.020
And it's, there's so many lines,
and all this Fosse dancing

01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:48.010
that I've never time.

01:04:48.010 --> 01:04:49.040
MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah, I was going
to ask you about the Fosse

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:51.385
dancing because you've got
all the acrobatic stuff.

01:04:51.385 --> 01:04:53.510
And you've got to get all
the notes and everything.

01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:55.968
But then you've got to do this
very precise Fosse routine--

01:04:55.968 --> 01:04:59.740
CIARA RENEE: Specific
dance that I only hope

01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:03.030
and pray that I'm doing
justice because I did not

01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:06.440
have any kind of Fosse training
before going into auditions

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:07.510
for this.

01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:09.810
I mean, I danced in college.

01:05:09.810 --> 01:05:13.230
But that's not my
strongest suit.

01:05:13.230 --> 01:05:14.960
But it's super fun
to do this dance.

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:18.960
It's so much more specific
than I've ever worked before,

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:22.370
and I'm glad to have been taught
this, just like the trapeze.

01:05:22.370 --> 01:05:24.020
I never thought
I'd be doing that.

01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:24.812
And here, you know?

01:05:24.812 --> 01:05:27.103
MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah, it's
almost like doing a small card

01:05:27.103 --> 01:05:29.190
trick, as opposed to
a huge magic trick.

01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:33.385
But I was noticing the precision
that you guys had on that.

01:05:33.385 --> 01:05:35.678
And-- it was pretty good.

01:05:35.678 --> 01:05:36.634
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:36.634 --> 01:05:39.024
CIARA RENEE: Well, thank you.

01:05:39.024 --> 01:05:40.460
AL SEALES: Well, it has to be.

01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:40.700
MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah?

01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:40.780
AL SEALES: It has to be.

01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:41.740
It's Fosse.

01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:44.430
That's the whole style
is very, very precise.

01:05:44.430 --> 01:05:46.350
So yeah, I guess we
have no more questions.

01:05:46.350 --> 01:05:47.715
Anybody else?

01:05:47.715 --> 01:05:50.320
And we can wrap this up?

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:51.000
Oh.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.906
CIARA RENEE: One more.

01:05:52.906 --> 01:05:54.280
AUDIENCE: How are
you guys doing?

01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:55.150
CIARA RENEE: Hi.

01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:55.650
KYLE DEAN MASSEY: Good.

01:05:55.650 --> 01:05:56.774
AUDIENCE: Is this thing on?

01:05:56.774 --> 01:05:59.480
Just because we're at
Google, home of YouTube,

01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:01.230
I just want to ask you
guys if you've ever

01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:05.400
messed around making any
original content on YouTube

01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:08.410
and, if you haven't, for
the acrobatic gentleman,

01:06:08.410 --> 01:06:09.910
I'd like to suggest
a channel called

01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:14.542
"The Amazing,
Indestructible Acrobat."

01:06:14.542 --> 01:06:15.750
You'd get a lot of hits, bro.

01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:17.690
CIARA RENEE: That's
your super hero name.

01:06:17.690 --> 01:06:20.164
AL SEALES: Would he just
throw things at his chest?

01:06:20.164 --> 01:06:21.330
AUDIENCE: It doesn't matter.

01:06:21.330 --> 01:06:24.960
When this guy talks,
everybody is like, oh my god!

01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:26.712
Oh, he's married?

01:06:26.712 --> 01:06:28.005
Eh.

01:06:28.005 --> 01:06:29.380
ORION GRIFFITHS:
Well, I actually

01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:35.645
have been shooting a documentary
over the last few years.

01:06:35.645 --> 01:06:37.750
I'm like, growing
up in the circus,

01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:39.680
I didn't go on the
computer very much.

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:43.250
So now I've got the
Facebook and all that stuff.

01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:46.919
And I try and go on it at
least once a week, you know.

01:06:46.919 --> 01:06:48.710
And everybody is like--
how come you never?

01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:51.470
I've got a Twitter, and
I've done three posts.

01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:54.740
But it's been eight months.

01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:56.710
It's just not how
I-- I grew up family.

01:06:56.710 --> 01:06:58.450
We spent time with each other.

01:06:58.450 --> 01:07:00.450
And so I'm getting used
to this whole new world.

01:07:00.450 --> 01:07:01.824
So I'm shooting
this documentary,

01:07:01.824 --> 01:07:03.200
and I'll bring it out soon.

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:05.950
And it's got some
crazy stuff in.

01:07:05.950 --> 01:07:07.940
Some crazy stuff.

01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:08.830
AUDIENCE: I bet.

01:07:08.830 --> 01:07:10.406
ORION GRIFFITHS: Yeah

01:07:10.406 --> 01:07:12.030
KYLE DEAN MASSEY: I
do a backstage blog

01:07:12.030 --> 01:07:16.654
at "Pippin" that's published
on YouTube every Thursday.

01:07:16.654 --> 01:07:18.310
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:18.310 --> 01:07:20.640
AL SEALES: Where do we find it?

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:21.931
KYLE DEAN MASSEY: I don't know.

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:25.827
It's Broadway.com.

01:07:25.827 --> 01:07:27.160
CIARA RENEE: Broadway.com, yeah.

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:28.839
KYLE DEAN MASSEY: Is
like edited for me

01:07:28.839 --> 01:07:29.880
and everything like that.

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:31.254
And I've been
shooting some today

01:07:31.254 --> 01:07:32.795
at [INAUDIBLE]
awesome cafeteria.

01:07:35.850 --> 01:07:37.514
But yeah, it's called
"Fresh Prince."

01:07:37.514 --> 01:07:38.430
AL SEALES: Fresh what?

01:07:38.430 --> 01:07:39.810
KYLE DEAN MASSEY:
"Fresh Prince."

01:07:39.810 --> 01:07:43.259
Yeah, because I play
a prince in the show.

01:07:43.259 --> 01:07:45.550
CIARA RENEE: And he always
catches me without my makeup

01:07:45.550 --> 01:07:47.990
on, so thank you for that.

01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:49.490
But yeah, for the
show, I have that.

01:07:49.490 --> 01:07:50.990
AL SEALES: You can
bring it up here.

01:07:50.990 --> 01:07:53.210
KYLE DEAN MASSEY: It's
all the way over there.

01:07:53.210 --> 01:07:55.487
AL SEALES: Yeah, that's OK.

01:07:55.487 --> 01:07:56.570
We'll wrap this up anyway.

01:07:56.570 --> 01:07:59.236
So yeah, everybody, please, give
them another round of applause.

01:07:59.236 --> 01:08:00.782
This has been incredible.

01:08:00.782 --> 01:09:37.594
[APPLAUSE]
