space well it's cold in space because

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579
space well it's cold in space because
 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.130
space well it's cold in space because
space is very large and most of it is

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140
space is very large and most of it is
 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.650
space is very large and most of it is
far away from stars so it's cold

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660
far away from stars so it's cold
 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.450
far away from stars so it's cold
everywhere except when you're near a

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460
everywhere except when you're near a
 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.850
everywhere except when you're near a
star like the Sun now when you are near

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860
star like the Sun now when you are near
 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.860
star like the Sun now when you are near
the Sun the Sun it's hot on the Sun side

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870
the Sun the Sun it's hot on the Sun side
 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.290
the Sun the Sun it's hot on the Sun side
and cold on the dark side and one of the

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300
and cold on the dark side and one of the
 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.000
and cold on the dark side and one of the
reasons that we can live here on earth

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010
reasons that we can live here on earth
 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.950
reasons that we can live here on earth
is the Earth spins around so that it

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960
is the Earth spins around so that it
 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.660
is the Earth spins around so that it
doesn't have time to really freeze over

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670
doesn't have time to really freeze over
 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.670
doesn't have time to really freeze over
night and doesn't have to time to really

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680
night and doesn't have to time to really
 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.160
night and doesn't have to time to really
boil on the in the daytime if the earth

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170
boil on the in the daytime if the earth
 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.830
boil on the in the daytime if the earth
didn't spin then we would be fried to

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840
didn't spin then we would be fried to
 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.630
didn't spin then we would be fried to
death on the hot side and we'd be frozen

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640
death on the hot side and we'd be frozen
 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.460
death on the hot side and we'd be frozen
to death on the cold side but we're

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470
to death on the cold side but we're
 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.549
to death on the cold side but we're
lucky the earth does spin
