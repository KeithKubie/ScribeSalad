00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.300
[inaudible] joining me today is the host of Tucker Carlson tonight on Fox News,

2
00:00:08.491 --> 00:00:12.990
now a New York Times bestselling author with his new book ship of fools,

3
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.160
Tucker Carlson.
Welcome to the Rubin.
I am glad to have you here,
my friend.

4
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.320
I'm glad to be here.
I love this.

5
00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:22.800
I don't know that anyone has ever walked in here and been more impressed by the

6
00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:24.270
Rubens and television,

7
00:00:24.271 --> 00:00:27.780
so I know what this is and it's just the coolest thing I've seen in a long time.

8
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.920
Are you jealous?
Are you joking?
Yes,
I'm jealous.

9
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.850
You have millions and millions of viewers driving across a massive staff,

10
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.500
but I don't have the control that you have,
which is wonderful.
Yeah,
control.

11
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.740
All right,
so speaking of control,
I have only one goal for the next hour,

12
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.750
which is to some point say something so ludicrous that you stare at me with that

13
00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:52.560
face.
We are where I can make do that.

14
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.970
Where did the face come?

15
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.010
It's totally everyone that memes that come into that layer.
Yannick.
Well,

16
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.060
the funny thing is when,
I mean that's just my face at rest,

17
00:01:00.061 --> 00:01:03.630
which is golden retriever.
Like I'm a mouth breather.

18
00:01:03.631 --> 00:01:06.420
And when I first started this show,
um,

19
00:01:06.421 --> 00:01:10.080
I got complaints about it internally and the idea was it's too embarrassing.

20
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.580
Click more on.
Um,
but I can't stop,
I can't help myself.

21
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.420
So I'm not as super self aware person.
I'm not a mirror user for example,

22
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.390
because if you work in TV and you become really self conscious,

23
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:23.730
it destroys you and makes you insecure.

24
00:01:23.731 --> 00:01:27.270
So I just am trained after 20 years not to think about the way I look.

25
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.060
And I didn't even know that I look like a moron listening,

26
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.110
but I do and I'm not changing.

27
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.660
Well I know you're not be asking because even just now when you were in the

28
00:01:36.661 --> 00:01:39.160
green room and my girl is putting makeup on your you,

29
00:01:39.161 --> 00:01:41.700
you sat there for literally two seconds,
you were like,
don't do anything.

30
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.450
You didn't even look at the mirror.
You are looking at me and you can go crazy.

31
00:01:45.451 --> 00:01:49.200
As you know in TV,
if you start to think about how other people perceive you,

32
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.550
you just drown in Lake me,
you know?
And I don't want that.
All right.

33
00:01:53.551 --> 00:01:55.710
So I'm glad to have you here for a couple of reasons.

34
00:01:55.711 --> 00:01:59.370
We're going to get into the book and obviously we're kind of simpatico and what

35
00:01:59.371 --> 00:02:03.120
I think are the big issues of the day to free speech and all that stuff.

36
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.890
But I will be totally honest with you,

37
00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:09.891
years ago when I first saw you on a crossfire on CNN and I was not a fan now,

38
00:02:11.371 --> 00:02:15.240
I was now,
I was living alone in that.
I thought,

39
00:02:15.241 --> 00:02:19.530
here's this bow tie wearing guide who's seemingly kind of smug and whatever.

40
00:02:19.531 --> 00:02:23.760
And I was a lefty at the time,
so,
so we were really polar opposites politically,

41
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.290
but everything has shifted enough that that we are kind of allies now.

42
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.470
And I actually think that's kind of cool.
So before we do anything else,

43
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.750
tell me about little Tucker Carlson.

44
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.230
People know about Tucker Carlson that eviscerates socialists all day.

45
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.610
What was that like as a kid?
Yeah,
in southern California and um,

46
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.670
we lived in studio city and I mean,

47
00:02:44.671 --> 00:02:49.140
I think I've always been the same anti-authoritarian for the individual against

48
00:02:49.141 --> 00:02:52.350
the group.
Um,
I hate bullies.

49
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.730
I hate being bullied more than anything.
And so if I find myself,

50
00:02:56.731 --> 00:03:01.000
and I've always been this way in a scenario where everyone is forced to sort of

51
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:02.740
nod in bovine agreement about something,

52
00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:07.360
my instinct is always to be the one guy who was like,
no.
And um,
so I,

53
00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:08.290
I haven't changed at all.

54
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:11.980
The particulars of my political beliefs have changed because America has changed

55
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:13.990
so dramatically.
I'm 49,

56
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:17.920
so in the last 40 years it's become a different country and a lot of the things

57
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:19.720
that I thought would work haven't worked.

58
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.960
A lot of the things I thought were not threatening turned out to be threatening.

59
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.420
So,
you know,
my views have changed,

60
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:29.140
but my instincts have remained I think consistent over time.

61
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.620
Were you always political or were your parents I was always political.

62
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.040
Well I was always interested in history and my father was a non conformist,

63
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.000
I would say.
I mean that's an understatement.

64
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.380
And his baseline position was just because everybody says it doesn't mean it's

65
00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:51.140
true and the answers to the way,
uh,

66
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.330
people are found in history because the one immutable fact of history as human

67
00:03:55.331 --> 00:03:57.130
nature,
like it literally does not change.

68
00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.410
And you see consistent themes over time.

69
00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:03.010
And so if you want to understand what's happening,
look backward and you will,

70
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.850
I mean,
just pretty conventional stuff.
But now it sounds kind of radical,
but,
um,

71
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.450
basically at my main influence was my dad.
I grew up with my dad and my brother.

72
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.970
And again,
his view was,
you know,

73
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.490
just because all the Chin tuggers are saying it does not prove it.
Yeah.

74
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.060
Does that seem like a pretty obvious through line to your success right now?

75
00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:27.061
Because it's like every day there is some other group think exactly lunacy that

76
00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:30.580
it's like these people then go onto your show.

77
00:04:30.581 --> 00:04:31.990
And I always think it's hilarious because it's like,

78
00:04:31.991 --> 00:04:34.980
do they know what they're getting into?
Do Your,
you know what I mean?
It's like,

79
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.930
yeah,
because I think they're going to be a,
and we'll,

80
00:04:37.931 --> 00:04:41.530
but they don't actually have the same goals for the debate that I do.

81
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.090
So I'm linear and literal and old fashioned and I go into it,
you know,

82
00:04:46.091 --> 00:04:49.330
believing that I can win the person over,
um,

83
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.360
with superior reasoning or larger and more compelling fact set or whatever.

84
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.630
They're coming to this believing they've already won because they have superior

85
00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:01.750
virtue.
So they're having a theological conversation.

86
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.260
I'm having a political debate and too often we talk rate the past,

87
00:05:05.261 --> 00:05:08.740
each of that's interesting theological conversation.
A couple,

88
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.720
a couple of people have mentioned on the show,
my friend Peter,

89
00:05:10.721 --> 00:05:13.180
because he was a philosophy professor who's been on a few times,

90
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.980
he calls this sort of new leftism a secular religion.
Of course.
Do you view that,

91
00:05:17.981 --> 00:05:18.191
look,

92
00:05:18.191 --> 00:05:21.430
I'm going to Pisco Paleon so I know what happened because the episcopal church

93
00:05:21.431 --> 00:05:25.430
was the church of them,
of America's ruling class,
our national cathedral,

94
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.740
an episcopal church.

95
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.600
So our culture was rooted in mainline Protestantism.

96
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:35.230
I mean this was a Protestant country and our rulers,

97
00:05:35.231 --> 00:05:40.231
whether they were like literally Protestant or not internalized the values of

98
00:05:40.601 --> 00:05:44.190
that faith.
And then within like a 20 year period,
the faith of apparated,

99
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.580
the episcopal church barely exists anymore.
And certainly as a national force,

100
00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:52.300
it's irrelevant,
but that didn't eliminate the religious impulse within people,

101
00:05:52.301 --> 00:05:54.100
which is inherent.
It's innate.
We're born that way.

102
00:05:54.101 --> 00:05:58.760
We worship something in the end,
whether,
you know,
it doesn't need to be God.
Um,

103
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:03.500
and so they've transferred that religious impulse to the political sphere.

104
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.030
They're making the same arguments that 19th century Protestants made,

105
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.180
especially the Calvinists.
Like,
I am saved.
Like I know this.

106
00:06:11.181 --> 00:06:15.020
That's my baseline assumption.
I'm one of God's elect.
You were not,

107
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.640
if you go into any conversation like that,
nothing will be resolved because,

108
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.490
because it's already been decided.
Well it's,
it's good versus evil.

109
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.530
Exactly.
Why exactly what it is.
Yeah.
Was it always like this?

110
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.290
No,
it wasn't like what,

111
00:06:32.291 --> 00:06:35.930
what gimme gimme some markers of when you saw things kind of start to change.

112
00:06:35.931 --> 00:06:38.910
I mean,
I've kind of,
you know,
I'm not an intellectual and a talk show host,

113
00:06:38.911 --> 00:06:43.100
so I'm a little,
now we have our promo clip.
Well,
it's,

114
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.070
it's true.
I mean that's what I do.
Um,

115
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.310
so it took me a while to see the outline.
I mean,

116
00:06:49.311 --> 00:06:53.570
this all comes kind of slowly to me because I'm caught in an earlier time just

117
00:06:53.571 --> 00:06:54.590
by virtue of my age.

118
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.130
And so I would have these conversations that were confusing to me where you

119
00:06:58.131 --> 00:07:01.850
would be debating as so called liberal and I would be,

120
00:07:01.851 --> 00:07:03.860
and I would find myself taking the liberal side,

121
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:08.890
like in favor of free speech or you might default suspicion of corporate power

122
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:14.240
or concentrations of power anywhere because it's a threat to the individual or

123
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.060
in favor of due process.
Or you know,

124
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:20.660
I would take a position that I heard liberals of my childhood take and the

125
00:07:20.661 --> 00:07:24.020
liberal,
I'm debating and be like,
nope.
You know,
if Google says it,
it's true.

126
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.730
Or you know,
if you're accused,

127
00:07:25.731 --> 00:07:28.160
prove yourself innocent or if what you say is offensive,

128
00:07:28.161 --> 00:07:30.200
you don't have right to say it and be like,
wait a second,

129
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.150
this is a mirror image of what I grew up with.

130
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.610
So actually to answer your question as honestly as I can,

131
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.580
I don't know if they ever really meant what they said.
I really don't.

132
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:41.750
It's possible that the pursuit of power and the empowerment of the Democratic

133
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:45.320
Party was always the goal and that was just the disguise they used in order to

134
00:07:45.321 --> 00:07:47.450
achieve it in 1979 I don't know the answer.

135
00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:53.090
Do you think we'd be in a healthier situation if there was a same democratic

136
00:07:53.211 --> 00:07:56.990
party even if all the policies were against everything that yes and believes,

137
00:07:56.991 --> 00:08:00.110
yeah,
that's the point of my book.
The Fung Shui is off,

138
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.100
so for like a hundred years you had one party,
which was the corporate party,

139
00:08:04.101 --> 00:08:06.260
the Republican Party,
the country club party,

140
00:08:06.261 --> 00:08:10.220
the party of the ruling class and the other party existed in effect to keep it

141
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.200
in check and to say,
wait a second,

142
00:08:12.201 --> 00:08:15.080
you know you're getting rich because all these people are working really hard.

143
00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:19.580
You need to think about their interests and a bunch of different things happen.

144
00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:24.110
The value of labor dropped because of technology to the point where it's not

145
00:08:24.111 --> 00:08:26.750
even worth representing the working class because they're not worth anything

146
00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:29.930
actually that this was the calculation of the Democratic Party.

147
00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:35.060
And so basically what you have is this weird alignment where the leadership of

148
00:08:35.061 --> 00:08:38.330
the Republican Party represents corporate interests and leadership of the

149
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.960
Democratic Party represents corporate interests and there's no one to represent

150
00:08:41.961 --> 00:08:45.140
the middle class and that again,
the balance is off.

151
00:08:45.141 --> 00:08:49.400
You need a vigorous party standing up and saying,
Whoa,
wait a second.

152
00:08:49.401 --> 00:08:51.920
You need balance always.
You need balance.
Yeah.

153
00:08:51.921 --> 00:08:55.410
So is that the part of this that sort of scary for our future and that's kind of

154
00:08:55.411 --> 00:08:59.070
what you're going for in the book is that if one side completely implodes,

155
00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:01.470
which it seems more likely as we're taping this at the moment,

156
00:09:01.471 --> 00:09:04.140
that the Democrats are going to absolutely implode.

157
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:07.860
That it's not as if all the conservative policies that you might like,

158
00:09:07.861 --> 00:09:12.630
we'd suddenly take root.
It's that we would actually tilt in some really bizarre,

159
00:09:12.631 --> 00:09:15.300
exactly.
That's exactly right.

160
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:20.670
I mean this is why marriage is an institution works because there's like another

161
00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:25.560
person pushing back against your bad instincts are balancing you out.

162
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:30.120
You know,
and what's true at home is probably true on a national scale,

163
00:09:30.121 --> 00:09:31.800
on a political scale.
And yes,

164
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:36.920
you absolutely need a vigorous and principled opposition party always or else

165
00:09:37.591 --> 00:09:39.960
you've got something really ugly.
Then you've got the Mana party,

166
00:09:39.961 --> 00:09:42.180
which is kind of what we have.
You know Jordan Peterson,

167
00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:45.330
who I know you admire also one of the lines when he's talking about politics,

168
00:09:45.331 --> 00:09:47.820
it's interesting you brought up marriage.
Hello.
He say,

169
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.040
you know it's like a fight with your spouse.

170
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.430
You don't want to beat them because then you're married to a loser.

171
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:58.460
You want to give them a chance to figure out something so that you'll be able to

172
00:09:58.861 --> 00:10:00.550
move forward.
We seem at this,

173
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.990
we're at this odd place right now where it's like one side is trying to be the

174
00:10:03.991 --> 00:10:04.411
other side.

175
00:10:04.411 --> 00:10:07.110
The other side I was trying to beat the other side and the rest of us,

176
00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:10.680
which I think is actually most of us are just like,
that's true.

177
00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.020
You don't want to beat your spouse because you're married to a loser,

178
00:10:13.021 --> 00:10:15.570
but you're also a loser if you're married to a loser.

179
00:10:15.571 --> 00:10:20.160
The point is you're implicated in the future of the other side because in the

180
00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:21.660
end you're all in this together.

181
00:10:21.661 --> 00:10:25.020
Even though you're coming from it from different perspectives.
So you're,

182
00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.880
we're all Americans.

183
00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:31.950
So in the same way that crushing your spouse doesn't actually win you any kind

184
00:10:31.951 --> 00:10:36.750
of meaningful victory or victory you'd want crushing your fellow Americans,

185
00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:41.580
doesn't improve your life or your country.
So like,
you know,

186
00:10:41.581 --> 00:10:43.350
you don't want any of this.
I totally,

187
00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:46.080
it's going to lead to something really bad action,
really ugly.

188
00:10:46.081 --> 00:10:50.430
And everybody who's paying any kind of attention senses it on an animal level.

189
00:10:50.431 --> 00:10:53.610
This is,
this is moving in a,
in a really ominous direction.

190
00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:58.610
So I know we could talk about why we're frustrated with the Democrats all year

191
00:10:58.650 --> 00:10:59.610
long and all that.
But let's,

192
00:10:59.611 --> 00:11:02.010
let's put that aside because I feel like that's a little bit of low hanging

193
00:11:02.011 --> 00:11:04.170
fruit and we both did.
We do it enough months.
So let's,

194
00:11:04.171 --> 00:11:06.180
let's talk more about the Republican's.
Yes.

195
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.860
So tell me some of your frustrations with the Republican Party.

196
00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:14.880
It's really simple.
The Democratic Party was for,
you know,
80,

197
00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:17.460
probably close to a hundred years,
the party of wage earners.

198
00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:20.970
And sometime in the last,
I would say 15 years,

199
00:11:20.971 --> 00:11:25.290
probably at the end of the Clinton right to kind of apex of the tech boom in the

200
00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:25.950
late nineties,
uh,

201
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:29.490
the Clinton ministration decided to reorient the party away from its traditional

202
00:11:29.491 --> 00:11:31.950
base to it's new base,
which is the rich and the poor.

203
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:35.730
And the Republican Party being dumb didn't see this.

204
00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:40.350
And it was only the emergence of Trump that forced them to sort of realize that,

205
00:11:40.351 --> 00:11:42.240
wait a second,
you know,

206
00:11:42.241 --> 00:11:45.930
we don't represent the people we thought we represented actually the country.

207
00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.840
It was the country club party.
They denied it.
The hated that,

208
00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.340
that line because it was true.
I mean it's,

209
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:55.940
it's the things that are true that we be here,
we hate the most,
but um,

210
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:59.290
we now need to become the middleclass party.
Well,

211
00:11:59.291 --> 00:12:02.230
they just didn't want to become the middleclass party actually at all.

212
00:12:02.231 --> 00:12:05.800
And it took Trump,
I mean,
Trump is a flawed person,
complex.
Well,

213
00:12:05.801 --> 00:12:08.960
not a complex person,
but if fraud person,
we'll get to that piece of it.

214
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:14.400
But he basically has forced the Republican party to be what it in effect already

215
00:12:15.521 --> 00:12:19.450
is the party of last resort for people making,
you know,

216
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.110
50 to $150,000 a year.
You know,

217
00:12:23.111 --> 00:12:26.590
the people who are making enough not to be on welfare but not enough to send

218
00:12:26.591 --> 00:12:29.200
their kids to summer camp.
That is a,

219
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:33.730
I mean that's the core of the country and they don't want to represent those

220
00:12:33.731 --> 00:12:36.940
people and to,
so to me and way I'm not one of those people.

221
00:12:36.941 --> 00:12:38.980
I'm not here to give you the view from coal country at all.

222
00:12:38.981 --> 00:12:41.020
I grew up in La Jolla and Georgetown,
so like,

223
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:43.930
but I know less about what the middle class thinks.

224
00:12:43.931 --> 00:12:45.490
I know a lot about what the ruling class things,

225
00:12:45.491 --> 00:12:50.380
having lived in it my whole life and they hate the leadership of the Republican

226
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:50.530
Party,

227
00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:55.120
hates the American middleclass and has contempt for them and that's infuriating.

228
00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:58.550
What does it say though,
that Trump who's not one of them exactly.

229
00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:02.580
To care about them?
You who's not.
One of them seems to carry them.
Me Grew up in,

230
00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:06.910
I've only lived in New York and La.
Exactly.
Care about them.
Like what is that?

231
00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:11.860
Why?
Why has there been such a shift that that almost seems impossible?
Well,

232
00:13:11.861 --> 00:13:14.110
I mean that Trump would be the hero of these people,

233
00:13:14.111 --> 00:13:16.750
but that's exactly the last time we had something like this.
Of course,

234
00:13:16.751 --> 00:13:18.670
it was in the progressive era.
Teddy Roosevelt,

235
00:13:18.671 --> 00:13:22.900
really the pivotal president of post civil war America,
I would argue,

236
00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:27.610
who made this a capitalist country by restraining capitalism.
The,
you know,

237
00:13:27.611 --> 00:13:31.360
the Romanovs didn't do that and they got 70 years bolshevism right.

238
00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:34.450
But Roosevelt,
who really was a genius was like,
wait a second.

239
00:13:34.451 --> 00:13:36.400
The concentrations of corporate power,
so scary.

240
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:39.250
They're gonna overwhelm the democracy and we're going to have a counter
reaction.

241
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:40.960
You don't,
the wobblies are going to take power.

242
00:13:40.961 --> 00:13:45.961
So Roosevelt was the last person to fill this role and he was exactly the same,

243
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:49.900
similar to Trump.

244
00:13:49.901 --> 00:13:53.350
He wasn't throwing chairs through the window into the country club.

245
00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:58.350
He was throwing them out onto the street like he was from the class that he was

246
00:13:59.501 --> 00:14:02.320
trying to restrain.
And you sort of have to be like,

247
00:14:02.321 --> 00:14:05.050
he knew what they were like cause he was one of them.
I don't know,

248
00:14:05.051 --> 00:14:08.470
there's something that,
but I would just say my,
for me it always goes back to,

249
00:14:08.471 --> 00:14:13.471
I have greater sympathy for the lone guy who's getting pushed around that I do

250
00:14:14.321 --> 00:14:15.730
for the group that's pushing them around.

251
00:14:15.731 --> 00:14:19.540
So I feel like right now the least popular group in America,
you know,

252
00:14:19.541 --> 00:14:23.350
lives in the middle west and they have kind of antiquated social attitudes and

253
00:14:23.351 --> 00:14:27.370
they have very little economic power and they're overweight and everyone hates

254
00:14:27.371 --> 00:14:31.120
them.
And I feel like really,
cause they're Americans actually like you don't,

255
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:32.110
what is this?
Why don't we,

256
00:14:32.111 --> 00:14:35.230
if they were doing this to black people or Hispanics or any group,

257
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.190
I would be sympathetic because I hate that.
Yeah.

258
00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:41.320
And I'm actually not even sure that when it comes to some of the social stuff

259
00:14:41.321 --> 00:14:44.710
that their abuser,
that antiquated gray,
I think they've changed it.
And I think,

260
00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:49.450
I mean,
I can see this from you would know,
you would know you people don't,

261
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.940
they want you to live however are they don't want you to come on their property

262
00:14:52.941 --> 00:14:56.200
and take their stuff and you can't punch him walking down.
You're like,
damn,

263
00:14:56.450 --> 00:15:00.800
the liberal gay guy from New York.
And they're like,
we love it.
Yeah,
no,
I mean,

264
00:15:00.801 --> 00:15:05.600
I totally agree actually.
Yeah.
But in the mind,
in the kind of,
you know,

265
00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:10.140
cliche,
controlled mind,
if your average Brooklyn intellectual,
you know,

266
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.510
they're all,
you know,
medieval,
but they're not actually there.

267
00:15:13.511 --> 00:15:16.630
They're basically libertarian and temperament.
They always have been.
Yeah.

268
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:21.530
So what is Trump then?
You've interviewed the guy a bunch of times.
I'm,

269
00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:22.413
well,

270
00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:26.730
what actually in the scheme of what your book is about and sort of where America

271
00:15:26.731 --> 00:15:27.740
is at at the moment,

272
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:32.330
is he just the great record that we sort of needed so that this ship of fools

273
00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:35.750
wasn't gonna sink and take everybody,
he's certainly a record.
Look,

274
00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:36.980
here's what Trump is not.

275
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.760
Trump is not the guy who comes to Washington and transforms the system because

276
00:15:40.761 --> 00:15:42.980
he's not capable of that.
He's not interested in that.

277
00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.700
Washington is a very specific town.
Okay.

278
00:15:46.701 --> 00:15:50.480
So like the legislative process is highly complex.
He doesn't understand.
It.

279
00:15:50.481 --> 00:15:51.320
Doesn't seek to,

280
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:54.680
he's not going to be the guy who runs on these nine policies and then affects

281
00:15:54.681 --> 00:15:57.710
them once elected,
gets them to the congress,
gets them to the agents.
He's,
he can,

282
00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.800
um,
that's not his role.
It's very frustrating actually.

283
00:16:00.801 --> 00:16:03.590
If you're from DC like me to watch it,
you're like,
wow,
we don't want a second.

284
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:05.690
Get the Energy Department under control.
Not going to happen.

285
00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:10.340
There's 3 million executive branch employees versus Trump Trump's role.

286
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:14.090
Is that right?
That's that right there.
There's 3 billion million,

287
00:16:14.091 --> 00:16:15.290
3 million executive.

288
00:16:15.291 --> 00:16:18.020
I think there are 3 million executive branch in play that at that may include

289
00:16:18.021 --> 00:16:22.040
the military by the way,
which was not white.
Um,
right.

290
00:16:22.041 --> 00:16:26.690
But I'm just saying like the permanent class in DC and I live right in the

291
00:16:26.691 --> 00:16:28.910
center of them.
You know,
they hate Trump.
He's a threat to them.

292
00:16:28.911 --> 00:16:31.880
But why do they hate him?
They hate him.
Not because he's a right winger.

293
00:16:31.881 --> 00:16:34.010
He's hardly a right winger.
Actually.
He,

294
00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:38.120
they hate him because he's the guy who says the obvious things.

295
00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:44.020
So like w w we went to Helsinki last summer and interviewed him during the Putin

296
00:16:44.361 --> 00:16:45.540
thing and I'll net like the,

297
00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:47.840
this crystallized for me in this conversation I had with him off camera.

298
00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:51.290
I said to,
I said something,
I'm gonna ask you about NATO.
And he goes,

299
00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:55.610
why don't we have NATO?
And as someone who's looked like a Cold War Kid,

300
00:16:55.611 --> 00:16:57.890
I was like,
well,
I like NATO.
I'm thinking to myself.
And he goes,

301
00:16:57.891 --> 00:17:00.280
you're not the Soviet Union,
you know,

302
00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:03.950
fell in 1991 it wasn't the point of Vedo keep them from invading western Europe,

303
00:17:03.951 --> 00:17:06.530
but they don't exist anymore.
Why?
Why do we still have them?

304
00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:09.740
And I'm trying to searching for a good answer and I couldn't find one.

305
00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:14.690
So Trump repeats this in public and everyone's like,
well,
shut up.
You know,

306
00:17:14.691 --> 00:17:17.990
what are you working for Putin?
And I thought,
this is what Trump does.

307
00:17:17.991 --> 00:17:21.830
He comes in and his kind of autistic way and ask the obvious question at the

308
00:17:21.831 --> 00:17:24.050
core of whatever the issue is.

309
00:17:24.051 --> 00:17:26.840
That is the one question everyone's been avoiding because they don't have the

310
00:17:26.841 --> 00:17:30.380
answer to it.
Yeah.
So like,
Whoa,
why do,

311
00:17:30.381 --> 00:17:33.500
why are we sending a trade agreement and letting the other signatories ignore

312
00:17:33.501 --> 00:17:35.840
the terms?
I don't,
why don't we have a border?
I don't know.

313
00:17:35.841 --> 00:17:38.720
These are like not complex questions are very obvious questions,

314
00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.500
but because they are unanswered and unanswerable,

315
00:17:42.501 --> 00:17:47.501
in some cases they expose sort of the mediocrity of our ruling classic.

316
00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.130
They actually don't know what they're doing is the truth.

317
00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.140
<v 1>All right.
So I have a lot of friends.
I think,
you know,</v>

318
00:17:52.141 --> 00:17:56.070
some of them who think that this thing that you're talking about with Trump is

319
00:17:56.071 --> 00:18:00.270
this sort of existential threat to the system that this erotic miss,

320
00:18:00.271 --> 00:18:02.740
this idea of you just throw the idea out there,
right.

321
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:05.340
And then let it sort of ruminate and see what happens.

322
00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:09.910
That that is just too dangerous to play ball with.
I suspect you disagreed.

323
00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:11.930
<v 0>Well,
I don't know.
I mean I don't think you want,</v>

324
00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:16.640
I mean populism is a threat to everything that we have.
I'm not a populist,

325
00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:19.280
um,
at all.
And I think it's,

326
00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:24.310
but I think populism arises as a symptom of discontent that you need to address

327
00:18:24.561 --> 00:18:27.620
in a democracy if you want to continue the democracy.
So,
um,

328
00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:32.120
I don't want to live in a country this volatile anymore.
Nobody does.

329
00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:36.080
But I think in order to solve the problems,
you have to name them.
You know,
I,

330
00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:37.640
I'm not one of these guys who's like,

331
00:18:37.641 --> 00:18:40.280
I believe in creative destruction is very easy to destroy things.

332
00:18:40.281 --> 00:18:42.200
Very hard to build them.
Yeah.
You know,

333
00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:46.550
it's incremental effort over time that builds things.
So,
no,
I mean,
look,

334
00:18:46.551 --> 00:18:49.040
I understand the complaint 100%,

335
00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:54.050
but I also think it's a two way deal here.
So if I say,
hey Dave,

336
00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:58.880
you know,
like,
did you pay for this house?
And you're like,

337
00:18:58.881 --> 00:19:00.890
that's the one thing I don't want to talk about because actually you didn't,

338
00:19:00.891 --> 00:19:05.090
you're just squatting here.
Yeah.
Who's fault is that?
I mean,
I guess,
you know,

339
00:19:05.091 --> 00:19:07.220
I'm disruptive for asking you the question,

340
00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:10.670
but she also should pay for the house.
You delay.
Do you know what I mean?

341
00:19:10.671 --> 00:19:14.510
So like he's calling bs on them.
I get why they don't like it,

342
00:19:14.511 --> 00:19:19.511
but it also is a call to action to them to like answer the question in rural in

343
00:19:20.511 --> 00:19:23.600
a way that is sensible and wise and sustainable and they're not.

344
00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:24.960
So the byline on the

345
00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:29.360
<v 1>book,
how is selfish ruling classes bringing America to the brink of revolution?</v>

346
00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:32.150
Yes.
Do you think we're that close?

347
00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:36.020
<v 0>I think we're in the middle of it.
Yeah.
We just like to Donald Trump president.</v>

348
00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:39.740
What?
I mean,
this is like,
this is what got me to write the book.

349
00:19:39.741 --> 00:19:40.760
Like Donald Trump,

350
00:19:40.761 --> 00:19:44.180
who I've known for 20 years and always sort of liked because we're like,

351
00:19:44.181 --> 00:19:47.080
why wouldn't you?
I think it's just funny as hell.
Did you,
did you ever do

352
00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:51.130
<v 1>I think he was racist or any of any of those phrases like put aside</v>

353
00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:55.650
<v 0>Twitter part,
Tom?
I mean look,
I think on some level everybody is bigoted.</v>

354
00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:59.740
I mean that's,
the human heart is dark and a white and you know,
it's a patchwork.

355
00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:04.570
But like talk about,
I mean,
look,
if he has a policy,
if he were to get up and say,

356
00:20:04.571 --> 00:20:04.811
you know,

357
00:20:04.811 --> 00:20:09.811
the problem is that this one racial group is screwing everybody else and in

358
00:20:11.321 --> 00:20:12.850
response we need to crush that.

359
00:20:12.851 --> 00:20:15.940
We need to attack them in public and then make it much harder for them to get

360
00:20:15.941 --> 00:20:20.520
jobs.
Government contracts get into school.
That would be race saturated.
Yeah.

361
00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:25.060
Oh wait.
That's what our ruling class has been doing for 35 years.
So,

362
00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.000
right.
You want really want to have a conversation about racism.

363
00:20:28.001 --> 00:20:31.630
Racism is attacking people on the basis of their immutable characteristics,

364
00:20:31.631 --> 00:20:36.460
which is like how our government operates.
It's totally wrong.
Um,

365
00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:41.380
so yes,
there's a lot of racism is Trump and offender.
I'd probably who isn't,

366
00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:46.270
but the actual structural racism that hurts people and rewards others on the

367
00:20:46.271 --> 00:20:49.360
basis of their color or something I thought we got rid of 50 years ago,

368
00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:51.370
that is not being perpetuated by Trump.

369
00:20:51.371 --> 00:20:54.820
It's being perpetuated and defended and celebrated by his critics.

370
00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:58.870
Don't lecture me or anyone else about racism if you're pushing that crap.

371
00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:00.100
Isn't that the irony?

372
00:21:00.101 --> 00:21:03.040
It's a blame of half the guests that you have on your show are the people who

373
00:21:03.041 --> 00:21:06.400
are actually trying to inject racism into the system.

374
00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:10.180
Quotas in the rest of of course.
And then you know,
why are they doing this?

375
00:21:10.181 --> 00:21:12.130
It was complicated psychological phenomenon,

376
00:21:12.131 --> 00:21:17.131
but at root it's much easier to maintain power when you divide your opponents,

377
00:21:17.621 --> 00:21:22.090
when you divide the country into warring tribes based on characteristics that

378
00:21:22.091 --> 00:21:24.790
don't change and therefore can't be resolved.
You know,

379
00:21:24.791 --> 00:21:27.490
this is how the British ruled India.
This is the problem with Rwanda.

380
00:21:27.491 --> 00:21:30.190
I mean this is like a very well known phenomenon.
But anyway,
yes,

381
00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:34.060
it's all projection and displacement.
It's like whatever I'm doing,

382
00:21:34.061 --> 00:21:38.050
I'm accusing you of doing like I can't believe you know,

383
00:21:38.051 --> 00:21:42.430
whatever it is and it's in it.
It's actually Orwellian cause it's not a lie.

384
00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:46.540
It's the mirror image of the truth.
Yes.
And your,

385
00:21:46.541 --> 00:21:49.220
this is what you're fighting constantly on your show.

386
00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:50.770
Well it actually gives you a headache.

387
00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:54.910
Like I have a bunch of kids and they lie because everybody lies and you

388
00:21:54.911 --> 00:21:57.700
especially lied to the people you love because you care about their opinion.

389
00:21:57.701 --> 00:22:00.040
Most.
So kids lie to their parents like it's a feature of it,

390
00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:05.380
but a child's lie is very recognizable because it's always three shades off from

391
00:22:05.381 --> 00:22:09.340
the literal truth.
So it's like you ate 10 Oreos.
No,
I just had three,

392
00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:11.840
but no one is contesting that you wait the Oreos.
Right.

393
00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:16.300
What they're doing is what all authoritarian regimes do in Orwell,

394
00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:20.560
being the great genius in English ever got right to the heart of it.
He's like,

395
00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:25.270
you know,
if I were dealing with a a powerful leftist,

396
00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:27.490
I would say you went through and it'd be like,
no,
actually you did.

397
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.210
You hit the Oreos and I'm going to punish.
It's like,
what?
No,
that's the it.

398
00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:37.600
It's actually much more effective and manipulative not to grade the truth and

399
00:22:40.061 --> 00:22:41.020
distort the truth,

400
00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:44.260
but to tell the opposite of the truth because it throws the other person

401
00:22:44.261 --> 00:22:46.430
completely off of the bat.

402
00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:51.440
That's been why they hate all of the suppose minorities who who walk away leave.

403
00:22:52.061 --> 00:22:52.450
That's,

404
00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:55.740
there's nothing they hate more than a gay person that leaves a black person.

405
00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:00.730
Really an Asian person that leaves.
Yeah.
I can't imagine I have,
you know,

406
00:23:00.731 --> 00:23:01.900
just because of my job.

407
00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:06.900
I mean I know a lot of people who dissent from the Orthodoxy within their group.

408
00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:10.210
Do you know,
cause I try to have him on because I think they're brave.

409
00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.840
Do you know what I mean?
Like I'm not involved in any of these debates.
I'm so,

410
00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:16.120
but,
but like if you're a gay guy who was like,
you know what?

411
00:23:16.121 --> 00:23:18.640
I'm not really on board with this.
What happens to you?

412
00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.480
It's and I have deep sympathy for my Twitter lately.
No,
I haven't.

413
00:23:22.481 --> 00:23:24.130
I would never go there because it upsets me.

414
00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:27.580
I think in the end the individual has a right to make up his mind.

415
00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:30.960
You can control what I do.
Okay.
Societies get to do that.

416
00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:33.310
They get to control the behavior of the people who live with them.

417
00:23:33.311 --> 00:23:35.440
You're not allowed to sleep in a crosswalk.
Sorry,
we don't allow it.
Fine.

418
00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:38.980
What you can't do is control what I think that's not allowed.

419
00:23:38.981 --> 00:23:43.981
That crosses the line from order to totalitarianism and all of a sudden for the

420
00:23:44.681 --> 00:23:48.080
first time,
my life,
that's what they are.
Not simply attempting but demanding.

421
00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:52.900
<v 1>Yes.
All right,
so then that's a perfect segue to the technological part of this.</v>

422
00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:56.130
Uh,
cause I think the last time I was on your show,
this is what we discussed,

423
00:23:56.131 --> 00:23:59.620
just what's going on with Google,
what's going on with the algorithms,

424
00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.230
are people be in shadow,
banned,
etc. Etc.

425
00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:05.230
I think there's plenty of evidence that yes,
this is all real.

426
00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.680
What is your solution to this?
I know,

427
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:13.710
I suspect you don't want the government coming in and fixing this or is this a

428
00:24:14.401 --> 00:24:15.420
unique case now?

429
00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.410
<v 0>Well,
it's,
I think it's a,
it's an,</v>

430
00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:21.520
I hate to use the term existential threat because it's so and overused,

431
00:24:21.521 --> 00:24:25.690
but actually it is an existential threat to the ability of the US government to

432
00:24:25.691 --> 00:24:30.190
run the country to administer the democracy.
Um,
yeah,

433
00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:31.260
look Google,

434
00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.350
there are 20,000 engineers,

435
00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:40.530
engineers making between two and $400,000 working right now just on Google

436
00:24:40.841 --> 00:24:41.200
search.

437
00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:45.760
Just on that one feature of Google 20,000 this is the most technologically

438
00:24:45.761 --> 00:24:48.760
advanced and powerful organization in the history of the world.

439
00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:52.300
It's technology and capabilities so far outstrip those are the Pentagon for

440
00:24:52.301 --> 00:24:56.560
example,
or the Chinese military or the Russian,
the Russians or any other group.

441
00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.920
This is the most powerful technological entity in the world,

442
00:24:59.921 --> 00:25:02.320
which has a chokehold on all human information in English.

443
00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:05.710
So that is all sort of all you need to know.

444
00:25:05.711 --> 00:25:07.930
I don't care if Jesus is in charge of the country.

445
00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:11.980
That's too much power for any entity to have.
And it's a,

446
00:25:11.981 --> 00:25:15.280
it's a threat to the nation state actually,
and it's a threat to all of us.

447
00:25:15.281 --> 00:25:16.570
So yeah,

448
00:25:16.571 --> 00:25:21.010
I think whatever it takes is what we need to do.

449
00:25:21.011 --> 00:25:25.630
Like now.
Yeah.
Is that a tough pill for a conservative to say?
They don't know.

450
00:25:25.631 --> 00:25:27.940
Are you kidding?
Well,
first of all,
I would say not to go to motive.

451
00:25:27.941 --> 00:25:28.661
I hate when people do that,

452
00:25:28.661 --> 00:25:32.350
but in fact a lot of them are just flat out bought off by Google.
Right?

453
00:25:32.351 --> 00:25:36.760
Google literally funds the antitrust think tank in Washington.

454
00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:42.930
[inaudible]
no,
but look,
but it's so asymmetrical,

455
00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:46.900
like all these debates are because with liberals who are only about power,

456
00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:50.950
you just make the pitch like,
look,
we'll fund you.
We're on your side.

457
00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:53.830
You know that we're part of the coalition of the ascendant.

458
00:25:53.831 --> 00:25:57.190
So just like no problem with conservatives,

459
00:25:57.310 --> 00:26:01.180
all the who are sort of like dog,
like in there.
Ooh.
Murcott you know what I mean?

460
00:26:01.181 --> 00:26:01.631
It's like,

461
00:26:01.631 --> 00:26:06.130
what are you against markets you want government control you for regulation.

462
00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:10.000
I'm ran and ran and ran.
That concern was like,
oh my gosh.
Kryptonite.
I'm sorry.

463
00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:13.420
You're right.
You're totally right,
Mr Google.
It's actually,

464
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.630
and so I feel like I'm the only person who like,
yeah,
of course I'm conservative.

465
00:26:16.631 --> 00:26:19.240
Of course I'm not for regulation.
Of course,
I believe in markets,

466
00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:21.400
but this isn't a free market.
This is your freedom.

467
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:22.690
This is your version of capitalism.

468
00:26:22.691 --> 00:26:26.140
This is what you've been promising all these years when like two guys who run a

469
00:26:26.141 --> 00:26:26.441
company,

470
00:26:26.441 --> 00:26:29.830
it's not even American whose values are not aligned with the interest of my

471
00:26:29.831 --> 00:26:32.950
country is in charge of the country.
No,
I'm not for that.

472
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:34.041
<v 1>I gotta say this man,</v>

473
00:26:34.041 --> 00:26:37.340
I did not think that I was going to bring you in here and that I'd have Tucker

474
00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:39.950
Carlson agreeing with my friend Eric Weinstein about this.

475
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:44.040
But that you're basically laying out the same case,
easily laid too big

476
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.010
<v 0>and,
and,
and sometimes I think,
well maybe I'm going crazy.</v>

477
00:26:47.011 --> 00:26:49.770
Maybe I'm thinking about this too much and I'm becoming like the Wacko who's

478
00:26:49.771 --> 00:26:54.590
like,
you don't understand the threat actually the deeply,

479
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:57.360
and I know people who work there and I've actually spent a lot of time on it

480
00:26:57.361 --> 00:27:00.840
cause I'm,
cause I know,
I don't think I'm overstating it.
And by the way,

481
00:27:00.841 --> 00:27:04.350
I'm not temperamentally an extremist.
I'm always,
I'm from southern California,

482
00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:09.510
you know,
I'm a kind of semi observant Episcopalian.
I'm not like no more,

483
00:27:09.511 --> 00:27:14.100
you know,
the end is no,
I am.
That's not the way I am.
But on this topic,

484
00:27:14.101 --> 00:27:17.790
I think I'm becoming that because I think the facts warranted.

485
00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:18.871
What do you make it,

486
00:27:18.871 --> 00:27:22.800
the whole shift sort of of what's happening with news and technology at the

487
00:27:22.801 --> 00:27:26.220
moment that,
it's funny,
I said this to you in the green room,

488
00:27:26.221 --> 00:27:29.180
but when I was doing a shoulder Peters and last week I said,
Oh,
you know,

489
00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:33.570
Tucker Carlson's on my show next week.
The audience went wild,
like went crazy.

490
00:27:33.571 --> 00:27:34.111
And I was like,
oh,

491
00:27:34.111 --> 00:27:37.530
that's interesting because I hear from so many of these young people that they

492
00:27:37.531 --> 00:27:40.560
don't get their new now,
uh,
from cable news anymore.

493
00:27:40.561 --> 00:27:44.970
I think you and Gutfeld are a little bit of a like a bridge sort of between

494
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.390
mainstream and,
and the Internet thing.
Um,
but that,

495
00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:50.460
that CNN has sort of become a joke that,

496
00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:54.870
that just saying these things about cable news,
that's already the punchline.

497
00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:59.460
And I spent many years at CNN hosting a show there and had a lot of,
have,

498
00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:03.060
have friends there.
I mean the landscape changes technology,
you know,

499
00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.940
destroys and then creates,
you know,
it's a very familiar cycle.

500
00:28:05.941 --> 00:28:08.850
I think cable news has remained relevant much longer than a lot of us who work

501
00:28:08.851 --> 00:28:12.030
in a thought it would,
but that of course will change because technically,

502
00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:15.390
once again,
technology changes everything.
What's ominous is the next thing.

503
00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:19.650
I'm completely for digital media.
I own part of a digital media company,

504
00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:25.010
but we've sort of wound up exactly and not in the opposite place.

505
00:28:25.891 --> 00:28:30.750
We expected to wind up.
I mean the promise was that this was going to diversify,

506
00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:32.491
you know,

507
00:28:32.491 --> 00:28:37.491
the media and decentralize power over information and of course the opposite,

508
00:28:38.071 --> 00:28:40.620
you know,
Google controls everything.
So without youtube,

509
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:41.910
I mean where are you with at Youtube?

510
00:28:41.911 --> 00:28:46.200
So we're actually finding ourselves more dependent upon a smaller group of

511
00:28:46.201 --> 00:28:49.410
people who hate free speech and hate our values.

512
00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:51.660
That's a very precarious place to be.

513
00:28:51.661 --> 00:28:56.340
Somebody needs to introduce competition into this space.
Like yesterday,

514
00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.710
like right now it's the most important thing.

515
00:28:58.711 --> 00:29:02.130
Otherwise we're going to find ourselves like at the mercy of these commissar.

516
00:29:02.131 --> 00:29:03.600
It's like,
is that where you want to be?

517
00:29:03.601 --> 00:29:04.980
It's the opposite of where you want to be.

518
00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.830
If only there were some influential billionaires.

519
00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:12.870
I know that might be listening to this show.

520
00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:15.420
We're not going to name names,
but whenever,

521
00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:18.120
two or more people who thought this through for 10 minutes get together,

522
00:29:18.121 --> 00:29:21.120
they mentioned one name and they're like,
why is he coming me to save us?

523
00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:24.570
Well now you said it's a he,
but let's not get lost in gender pronouns.
