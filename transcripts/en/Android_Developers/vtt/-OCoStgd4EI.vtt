00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.250
Hello and welcome back.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.700
Now, in our previous lesson,
we unlocked two achievements

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.250
that are fairly easy to get.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.800
The first timer
achievement you get

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.160
for playing the game and
the Ot-nay Oo-tay Ight-bray

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.290
achievement that you get for
making a not particularly

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.310
good guess.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.020
And while it's easy to
earn these achievements,

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.210
if you actually want to test
earning these achievements

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.550
multiple times, it's
kind of difficult to do,

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.140
because you can't
earn them again.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.400
You already have them.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.390
And that brings us to the topic
of the game's management APIs.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.170
Now, as you recall, we provide
a lot of rest end points

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.640
for you to unlock achievements,
or anchor in achievements,

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.830
or submit score to leaderboards,
and so on and so forth.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.440
We also provide a set
of restricted end points

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.000
that allow you to, for instance,
remove a player's scores

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.570
from the scoreboard.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.130
Or hide a particular
player who is potentially

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.950
cheater from appearing in
the public leaderboard.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.640
Or in this particular
case, we give you

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.560
the ability to
reset an achievement

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.760
to its original state.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.790
Now, these management
APIs are very powerful,

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.300
and you don't want them
falling into the wrong hands.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.480
And so the one
restriction around them

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.530
is that they can only be called
in your application by people

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.510
you have listed as testers.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.390
So remember, if we go back
here to the developer console,

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.160
and we click on
little testing link,

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.150
only the people
who are added here

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.060
will be able to
make these calls.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.534
Which, if you think about
it, kind of makes sense.

00:01:36.534 --> 00:01:37.950
You don't want
your average player

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.520
to be able to reset
their achievements.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.280
They would probably be
very mad if somehow they

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.910
accidentally did that.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.970
And so in my case, because I
am testing with my development

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.730
account, I will be able to
make these calls pretty easily.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.530
Now, how do we make these calls?

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.790
If you've been investigating
at the library at all,

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.470
or viewing the documentation,
or playing around

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.160
with the auto
complete, you might

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.320
notice that we have a couple
of pretty nifty functions.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.070
Let me go into my
achievement manager here.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.130
For instance, once you
have a GPG achievement,

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.890
you can actually call--
we'll call unlock me,

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.180
reset achievement with
completion handler.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.540
And and this would make a
call to our management APIs,

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.040
and say, hi, please reset
this particular achievement

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.030
for this player.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.720
And the results
will be passed back

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.650
in this completion handler.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:38.330
Similarly, we also have a
class method GPG achievement

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.270
reset all achievements
with completion handler.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.170
And this does the same thing,
except that it basically

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.090
resets all achievements
for the player.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.140
And this seems like this
is pretty useful, right?

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.190
You can kind of-- I could
hook up a button within my app

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.270
maybe, called QA debugging,
that brings up another view

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.700
controller that has a few
buttons that would link

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.640
to a reset all achievements
method, and reset my scores,

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.020
leaderboards method,
and so on and so forth.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.940
There's just one
tiny little problem,

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.540
which is that these calls
don't work right now.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.960
The team knows about it,
they have promised me

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.070
that there will be
a fix in an upcoming

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.190
version of the library, however,
that's not available here

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.670
for my screencast,
and that makes me sad.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.840
But only a little sad,
because you know what?

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.210
We can still make these
calls the old fashioned way,

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.450
by directly accessing
the rest end points.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:34.260
So let's do that.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.200
This will be kind of
a fun little refresher

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.640
course on how to make
these REST calls.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.240
So, first thing,
let's delete this.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.690
Keep our code nice and tidy.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.606
Now, the first thing
we're going to need to do

00:03:46.606 --> 00:03:48.930
is get our access token
to make this call.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.710
And so I can go back into
my game view controller,

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.630
sorry my intro view
controller here.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.220
And you'll notice this
is where I commented up

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.770
this section, where I blog,
hey, here's our auth object.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.150
But let's go ahead and
get our access token back,

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.630
so we can make some-- authorize
some calls outside of our game.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.050
So first thing, I'm going to
scroll up to the top here,

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.980
and I'm going to import
 GoogleOpenSource/GoogleOpenSource.h.

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:23.690
And now, I'm going
to go down in here,

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:30.560
and if there's no error
NSLog, our access token

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.447
is this string.

00:04:33.447 --> 00:04:34.780
And we'll call auth.accessToken.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:54.050
Let's run this, and you can
see right here in our console,

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.520
I now have an access
token that I can use.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.590
So I'm going to copy this and
the next thing I'm going to do

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.440
is bring up my
terminal, or iTerm,

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.380
and I'm going to
make a curl call.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.550
So if you're on an OSX
device, it's Linux-based,

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.590
and so you have this
nifty little utility

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.730
called curl that
allows you to basically

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.210
access pages or other
resources over HTTP directly.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:22.660
So I'm going to do this.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:34.770
Go to curl https,
 googleapis.com/games/v1/players/me/achievements.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:45.349
And our access token
equals this thing.

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:47.140
And here we have a list
of our achievements

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.459
and their current status.

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:50.000
We've got a couple
that are unlocked,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.480
one that's revealed
but not earned

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.870
and another that's
revealed but not earned,

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.970
but we've made some steps
towards completing it.

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.550
This one is very clearly our
Centiguesser achievement.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.230
By the way, in case
you're wondering,

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:06.340
how did I know what
this giant URL is,

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.570
it's in our documentation.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:22.660
So if you were to go to
 developers.google.com/games/services,

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.270
You can go to the web here,
look at rest API reference,

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.090
and here's a bunch
of calls you can get.

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.190
So under achievements,
achievement list

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.120
was actually the
call that I made.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.310
And you can see, here's the URL,
games/v1/players, the player

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.840
ID, in this case
entering me just

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.500
means the player who is
making this call as identified

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.220
by the access token.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.636
And this will list
the achievements.

00:06:47.636 --> 00:06:49.010
Now this is good,
but this lesson

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.320
is really about the
management APIs.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.070
So we're going to look at
this management API reference,

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.530
and under here
under achievements,

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.584
we have a couple of methods,
reset and reset all.

00:06:58.584 --> 00:06:59.500
So let's look at this.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.120
So if we want to reset
a specific achievement,

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.120
looks like we can do that
by making a post call here,

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.400
and passing in some data where
our achievement ID equals

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.870
the achievement ID.

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.400
It's a string.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.440
So now let's pick one that
we actually want to reset,

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.820
according to-- so
this one ending in AE

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.400
is our Ot-nay Oo-tay
Ight-bray achievement.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.590
Yours is probably different,
but, we can look at this

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.490
and figure out the call to make.

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:38.130
So I'm going to
make a curl call to

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:48.305
https://www.googleapis.com/games/v1management--
 again, that's V1 management,

00:07:48.305 --> 00:07:57.020
not v1, /achievements/-- and
it's this thing ending in AE

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.640
/reset.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:04.060
And our access token
equals this thing

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.560
we had copied and
pasted earlier.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.020
And then we also need to
pass in the same achievement

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:15.400
ID you can see here as
data in our post call.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.320
And we can do that
just by adding dash

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:23.749
d, achievement, ID equals.

00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:25.290
And then we paste
back in this thing.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.289
We enter that, and it
tells us, oh OK, it

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:34.159
looks like that
achievement is now hidden.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:38.610
And again, if we were to list
our achievements directly,

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:42.510
we could see that we now we
have our revealed, not earned,

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:47.440
revealed incremental,
unlocked and hidden.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.325
And let's look at our reset all.

00:08:52.959 --> 00:08:54.500
And this one looks
even easier, we're

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:58.250
just doing a call to
achievement/reset.

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:00.522
So I'm going to-- you know what?

00:09:00.522 --> 00:09:01.855
We can just copy and paste this.

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:08.400
Oops, it's giving me
a not found error,

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.080
probably because I did not
put in pass in my access

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:19.460
token equals, and again we
can paste in this access token

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:22.146
that we got for our console.

00:09:22.146 --> 00:09:24.170
Oh, I guess we're
still getting an error,

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:27.270
and OK, this is because
curl is by default sending

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.310
this is as a get,
and if you'll notice,

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:31.290
this call is actually
a post request.

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:33.710
So I think I can force
this to be a post just

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:36.810
by adding some data here.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:41.500
Yeah, there we go It sends back,
by the way, which achievements

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.022
have now been reset.

00:09:43.022 --> 00:09:44.980
So it looks like we had
two other achievements,

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:47.490
our incremental achievement,
and our first timer

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:52.200
achievement, that
have been reset now.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.440
And again, if I were to do a
quick look at our achievements,

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.990
we can see they're all now
back in their initial state.

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:01.810
So let's go back to our app.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.540
By the way if I were to
click achievements right now,

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:07.480
my guess is-- yeah,
it's cached this data,

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.930
it doesn't know that
anything's changed yet.

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.170
So it'll still give us this.

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:13.780
Not unexpected, so
the best thing to do

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:20.400
is just-- we'll quit
this, run it again,

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.650
get the-- we'll force the
library to fetch new data.

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:26.410
And now we can look
at our achievements,

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:29.220
and i can once again
see that they're empty.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:32.140
And hooray, now we can
go about making sure

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:35.780
that we've earned
them correctly.

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:40.047
So we can now go ahead and--
I'm going to guess 50 again,

00:10:40.047 --> 00:10:43.730
and-- we still got the Ot-nay
Oo-tay Ight-bray achievement,

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:45.530
that is now freshly unlocked.

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:48.930
And we could do this
again any time our tester

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:52.700
needs to go through
the QA plant.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.580
And so, digging up
your access token,

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:58.020
making this curl call, not
hugely convenient, but still

00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:58.936
pretty easy to do.

00:10:58.936 --> 00:11:00.310
Particularly if
you're developer,

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:02.462
and I'm guessing
most of you are.

00:11:02.462 --> 00:11:05.400
There are a few other
ways we could do this.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.800
The other will be to wait
for this library to be fixed.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.540
And build your own
end game interface.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.920
Again, once there's an
update to the library,

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.840
I will post a screencast
that shows you

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.650
exactly how to do that.

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:19.810
It should also be
noted that if you

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:22.850
were to look at
our downloads page,

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:26.610
there's a link to a utility
called Management Tools.

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:29.680
And this is an
application that can

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:33.000
make all of these management
API calls for you.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.610
This is something that you
would set up and run, say,

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:38.440
on Localhost, or on
your own web server.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.540
And basically, it just automates
grabbing your access token,

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:46.370
and making these REST
calls on your behalf,

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:47.860
without your having
to enter them

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:50.409
in manually as a curl call.

00:11:50.409 --> 00:11:51.950
So I encourage you
to check this out,

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:54.250
this would be particularly
useful for development.

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:55.791
It also contains
some tools you might

00:11:55.791 --> 00:11:58.939
want to use post launch,
for some community support.

00:11:58.939 --> 00:12:00.480
And maybe if there's
enough interest,

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.720
I'll create a series of
screencasts on this as well.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.360
But, hey, let's not
get too distracted.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.560
We have other iOS
stuff to finish first.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.160
We've gotten our achievements,
and we've gotten them working,

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.660
and we've shown you how to earn
them, how to increment them,

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:13.950
how to reset them so
you can test them again.

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:16.229
But we haven't done anything
with our leaderboards.

00:12:16.229 --> 00:12:18.270
Now luckily, most of the
process for leaderboards

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:21.250
is fairly similar to what
we did with achievements.

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:23.620
So this next section
should be pretty easy.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.360
So stay tuned, and I'll
see you in the next lesson.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.910
Bye.
