00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.680
CHRISTINA HALPERIN: I'm
Christina Halperin.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.870
I'm a Latin American Studies
Cotsen Post Doctoral Fellow

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.400
here in the Society Fellows
at Princeton University.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.830
Right now, I'm teaching a course
in the Department of

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.200
Art and Archaeology called
Mesoamerican Material Culture

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.280
that explores pre-Columbian
Mesoamerican cultures from the

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.270
perspective of archaeology.


00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:18.410
BRYAN JUST: Hi.


00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.600
My name is Bryan Just.


00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.030
I'm the curator for ancient
American art

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.890
here at the art museum.


00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.720
And we're working with Professor
Christina Halperin

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.970
today to allow her students and
their precepts to examine

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.180
firsthand original works of
ancient Maya ceramic, both

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.630
vessels and figurines.


00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.790
CHRISTINA HALPERIN: When we
worked in the museum, the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.030
students being able to actually
look at some of these

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.530
pieces and touch them--


00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.280
they can think about ways in
which people in the past may

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.010
have actually worked
with these objects

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.040
and experienced them.


00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.150
So in looking at a ceramic
vessel that has a narrative

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.220
scene around the vessel itself,
they're able to get a

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.790
sense of actually how that story
was told and the way in

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.270
which someone may
have held it.

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.020
Some of the complete specimens
that are at the museum, you

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.410
can actually play them and hear
how certain resonances

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.400
and sounds were like
in the past.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.820
Can you hear it?


00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.770
DANIELA COSIO: Yeah.


00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.140
CHRISTINA HALPERIN: That
one is a rattle.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.070
BRYAN JUST: So this
is the blow piece.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.260
This is the sound hole.


00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.720
And these are for changing
tone.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.410 position:97%
 


00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.200
[OCARINA PLAYING]


00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.640
PENG PENG: That's amazing


00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.510
DANIELA COSIO: That's so cool.


00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.190
CHRISTINA HALPERIN: Good job.


00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.730
And you're, of course, blowing
life into the figures.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:41.960
You're animating them.


00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.240
BRYAN JUST: As a compliment to
the study today, the students

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.160
will be actually experimenting
with manufacturing works in

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.430
clay to understand the mold
making and modeling processes

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.540
and hopefully, to gain a deeper
appreciation for the

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.180
skill and expertise that went
into producing the works of

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.140
art we have here at
the art museum.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.380
CHRISTINA HALPERIN: There's
this wonderful aspect of

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.250
childhood of experimentation
and play that allows you to

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.140
learn, that allows you to think
about and move things in

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.540
ways that you wouldn't
have normally done.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.960
We tend to work so rigidly
according to these rules and

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.710
these structures that we forget
that this form of

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.040
experimentation and
play allows us to

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.200
think in new ways.


00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.440
And I think that that's what
some of this teaches us.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.520
DANIELA COSIO: It was really
cool to be able to make

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.220
something--


00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.620
especially something that we've
been seeing in class and

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.350
in precept--


00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.080
and to be able to make it with
our own hands and understand

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.980
the time and effort that went
into something like this--

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.880
or with the molds, the lack of
time and effort that went into

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.080
it-- and the types of people
that could have been making

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.620
things like this
in Mesoamerica.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.610
SARAH MAGAGNA: I think this is
case for not just ceramics,

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.630
but for other visual arts.


00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.400
But it really helps you to
understand so much better just

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.380
the circumstances of production
and the processes

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.840
when you have done
it yourself.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.420
So I think it's really great
when we learn about the

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.000
materiality of the work
and how it's made.
