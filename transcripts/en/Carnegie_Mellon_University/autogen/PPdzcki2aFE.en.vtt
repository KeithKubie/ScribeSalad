that's very important for us to have

that's very important for us to have
 

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:09.270
that's very important for us to have
that close collaboration between the

another feature which i think is quite

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:28.240
another feature which i think is quite
 

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:33.120
another feature which i think is quite
unique for for the UN is that we reach

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:33.130
unique for for the UN is that we reach
 

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:37.190
unique for for the UN is that we reach
decisions and conclusions almost

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200

very very rare to have a vote in the ITU

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:47.200
very very rare to have a vote in the ITU
 

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:52.200
very very rare to have a vote in the ITU
and I believe that that culture goes

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:52.210
and I believe that that culture goes
 

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:54.540
and I believe that that culture goes
back you know in history and it's

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:54.550
back you know in history and it's
 

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:58.500
back you know in history and it's
because there we have to reach agreement

00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:58.510
because there we have to reach agreement

because there we have to reach agreement
on the use of the radio spectrum and

on the use of the radio spectrum and
 

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.640
on the use of the radio spectrum and
because radio frequencies don't respect

because radio frequencies don't respect
 

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:09.960
because radio frequencies don't respect
borders so countries have to get

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:09.970
borders so countries have to get
 

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:15.290
borders so countries have to get
together and agree on the global use of

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:15.300
together and agree on the global use of
 

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:19.050
together and agree on the global use of
frequencies and if they didn't then of

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:19.060
frequencies and if they didn't then of
 

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.660
frequencies and if they didn't then of
course they'd be interfering with each

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:21.670
course they'd be interfering with each
 

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:25.820
course they'd be interfering with each
other and there would be mutually

area has been very successful because
 

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.949
area has been very successful because
countries do make a lot of effort to

00:11:03.949 --> 00:11:03.959
countries do make a lot of effort to
 

00:11:03.959 --> 00:11:06.509

so this is why I tu always emphasizes
 

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:14.040
so this is why I tu always emphasizes
the need for the provision of broadband

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:14.050
the need for the provision of broadband
 

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:18.810
the need for the provision of broadband
and emphasizing the fact that this is

and emphasizing the fact that this is
 

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:22.860
and emphasizing the fact that this is
not a luxury anymore but it's an

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:22.870
not a luxury anymore but it's an
 

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:26.070
not a luxury anymore but it's an
essential utility that all countries

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:26.080
essential utility that all countries
 

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:31.560
essential utility that all countries
should have and last year as you know

these 17 SDGs there are a number of
 

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:15.600
these 17 SDGs there are a number of
targets is a total of a hundred and

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:15.610
targets is a total of a hundred and
 

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:18.810
targets is a total of a hundred and
sixty-nine targets to be achieved and if

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:18.820
sixty-nine targets to be achieved and if
 

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.380
sixty-nine targets to be achieved and if
you look at these targets it's clear

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:21.390
you look at these targets it's clear
 

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:26.480
you look at these targets it's clear
they can't be achieved without

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:26.490
they can't be achieved without
 

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:30.210
they can't be achieved without
widespread access to high speed high

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:30.220
widespread access to high speed high
 

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:35.940
widespread access to high speed high
speed broadband services and for example

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:35.950
speed broadband services and for example
 

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:38.730
speed broadband services and for example
if you look at the target for having the

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:38.740
if you look at the target for having the
 

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.120
if you look at the target for having the
number of deaths and injuries on roads

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:41.130
number of deaths and injuries on roads
 

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:46.250
number of deaths and injuries on roads
clearly that's going to need the use of

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:46.260
clearly that's going to need the use of
 

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:51.110
clearly that's going to need the use of
icts for smart transport management and

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120
icts for smart transport management and
 

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:56.030
icts for smart transport management and
of course it's been well recognized that

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.040
of course it's been well recognized that
 

00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:00.840
of course it's been well recognized that
ubiquitous cars you know self-driving

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:00.850
ubiquitous cars you know self-driving
 

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:04.490
ubiquitous cars you know self-driving
cars will greatly reduce accidents so

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:04.500
cars will greatly reduce accidents so
 

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:08.070
cars will greatly reduce accidents so
that's another example of the importance

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:08.080
that's another example of the importance
 

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.070
that's another example of the importance
of icts on just on that target and then

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:11.080
of icts on just on that target and then
 

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:14.480
of icts on just on that target and then
doubling the rate of energy efficiency

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:14.490
doubling the rate of energy efficiency
 

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:19.520
doubling the rate of energy efficiency
clearly that's going to require a lot of

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:19.530
clearly that's going to require a lot of
 

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:23.510
clearly that's going to require a lot of
widespread use of smart meters in homes

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:23.520
widespread use of smart meters in homes
 

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:27.300
widespread use of smart meters in homes
it's going to need very innovative

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:27.310
it's going to need very innovative
 

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:32.340
it's going to need very innovative
energy saving solutions and then another

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:32.350
energy saving solutions and then another
 

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:37.290
energy saving solutions and then another
target is to substantially control the

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:37.300
target is to substantially control the
 

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:41.610
target is to substantially control the
use of of water to improve the water

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:41.620
use of of water to improve the water
 

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:44.870
use of of water to improve the water
efficiency and this again will require

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880
efficiency and this again will require
 

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:49.560
efficiency and this again will require
icts especially for managing irrigation

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:49.570
icts especially for managing irrigation
 

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:51.870
icts especially for managing irrigation
re irrigation is the biggest use of

back and so this was an issue that that

00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:39.660
back and so this was an issue that that
 

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:43.100
back and so this was an issue that that
was discussing basically the the

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:43.110
was discussing basically the the
 

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:48.530
was discussing basically the the
technology is incorporated in a sort of

00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:48.540
technology is incorporated in a sort of
 

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:52.130
technology is incorporated in a sort of
a general standard that was adopted by

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:52.140
a general standard that was adopted by
 

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:55.760
a general standard that was adopted by
the ITU on digital object identifier the

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:55.770
the ITU on digital object identifier the
 

00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:57.740
the ITU on digital object identifier the
idea of the standard was to ensure

00:36:57.740 --> 00:36:57.750
idea of the standard was to ensure
 

00:36:57.750 --> 00:37:00.410
idea of the standard was to ensure
interoperability between different types

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:00.420
interoperability between different types
 

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:02.300
interoperability between different types
of technologies so it wasn't

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:02.310
of technologies so it wasn't
 

00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:05.870
of technologies so it wasn't
specifically on that technology but that

00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:05.880
specifically on that technology but that
 

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:10.580
specifically on that technology but that
technology is being used in the ITU and

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:10.590
technology is being used in the ITU and
 

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:14.470
technology is being used in the ITU and
is itu offers it to other UN agencies

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:14.480
is itu offers it to other UN agencies
 

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:18.690
is itu offers it to other UN agencies
because it's a unique persistent

00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:18.700
because it's a unique persistent
 

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:23.789
because it's a unique persistent
and like I'm some

00:37:23.789 --> 00:37:23.799
 

00:37:23.799 --> 00:37:26.650

are using it more widely for other
 

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:32.349
are using it more widely for other
things but it's it's not specifically an

this year that it would only be used for
 

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:55.750
this year that it would only be used for
those purposes and IT wouldn't be

00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.760
those purposes and IT wouldn't be
 

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.789
those purposes and IT wouldn't be
