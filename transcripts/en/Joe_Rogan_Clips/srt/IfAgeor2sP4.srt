1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,030
I'm in this level of murder
that's happened a lot of
parts of Latin American now.

2
00:00:03,031 --> 00:00:03,661
It's crazy.

3
00:00:03,661 --> 00:00:07,530
But in these areas is in as what he
talked to other people who are just on the

4
00:00:07,531 --> 00:00:10,980
edge of this or have family members
involved in this and it's just they're

5
00:00:10,981 --> 00:00:11,581
living this,
I mean,

6
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:14,640
these are levels of violence and it's
interesting to compare historically these

7
00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:16,870
levels of violence.
Um,

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,870
because you look at some of the worst
cities like San Pedro Sula on Doris

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:22,351
Caracas,
um,

10
00:00:22,351 --> 00:00:27,351
Ciudad Juarez and these are places
which have levels of violence,

11
00:00:29,101 --> 00:00:32,160
which are like way worse
than medieval Europe.

12
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,370
A lot of places in medieval Europe,
I mean,

13
00:00:35,371 --> 00:00:40,260
look at the figures per hundred thousand
because some of them have over a

14
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,680
hundred, a hundred thousand, 150,
100,000 and met Eva Europe Lot.

15
00:00:43,681 --> 00:00:46,960
These cities were like 20 per hundred
thousand. So they're way worse than that.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,210
Way Worse than the wild west than like
now there are some place in the United

17
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,030
States that de la, oh, an idea. And I've
done some research recently in Baltimore,

18
00:00:54,031 --> 00:00:56,010
Maryland and I was kind of,

19
00:00:56,011 --> 00:01:00,780
it's interesting to compare that to
Latin America and that's a high level.

20
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:05,070
That's 40 a hundred thousands that's not
as the same level, but it's significant.

21
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:10,200
Still more than medieval
Europe. Yeah. Wow. Baltimore's
worse than Medieval Europe.

22
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,290
Yeah.
I'm an advocate.

23
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,670
You have to have to some professors then
they weren't in a like you get like,

24
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,780
you know, they might be, they might say,

25
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:19,630
well Jerusalem in this time or in a line
I let you got to try and free. Nice.

26
00:01:19,631 --> 00:01:21,690
Hard to know. Really dig down. Exactly.

27
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:24,930
And that there was outbreaks of
violence and killing in certain places.

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,790
The overall average of all
the average year, that's a
significant leap. 100% leap.

29
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,450
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Baltimore.
What about South side of Chicago?

30
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,160
It's not that,

31
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:41,190
I mean like the level I think in Chicago
comes out around 20 or something,

32
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:45,180
so it's not now the Emerg that of
the host city. Now these again,

33
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:48,630
and one of the things about the violence
in the United States compared to Latin

34
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:53,610
America in Baltimore is, is, is,
is significant bits of fairly,

35
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,480
well, the city of Baltimore is a fairly
small place where they're talking about,

36
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,930
so in Mexico you have entire states
that are like really violent or entire

37
00:02:00,931 --> 00:02:02,730
countries in Latin America,

38
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:07,020
whereas in the U s it tends to be
neighborhoods which are violent. Um,

39
00:02:07,021 --> 00:02:09,650
so if you really focus on
the south side of Chicago,

40
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,880
it's probably similar levels
to Baltimore then United, sir.

41
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,060
But if you look at the whole city,

42
00:02:15,061 --> 00:02:17,130
you've got neighbors that are
pretty safe in Chicago as well.
