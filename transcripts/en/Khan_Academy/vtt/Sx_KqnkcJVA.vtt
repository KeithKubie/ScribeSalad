00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.680
We're on problem
47 on page 281.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.970
If the two floors in a certain
building are 9 feet apart, how

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.240
many steps are there in a set
of stairs that extends from

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.730
the first floor to the second
floor of the building?

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:17.910
So I think I can draw that.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.920
So this is the second floor,
this is the first floor.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.090
They want to know how many
there's-- they're 9 feet

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.890
apart, that's what they tell us
already-- 9 feet, we need

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.540
to figure out how many steps
there are to go from the first

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.350
to the second floor.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.400
So piece of information one,
they give us, each

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.830
step is 3/4 foot high.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.170
Well, this by itself should
give us enough

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.890
information, right?

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.820
Because each of these
distances-- I'll do it in

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.030
green-- each of these
are 3/4 foot high.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.760
So to figure out how many total
steps to get to the top

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.530
you just say 3/4 times the
number of steps is going to be

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.750
equal to 9.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.620
And then you could just solve
this by multiplying

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.920
both sides by 4/3.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.100
But we don't have to solve it.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.340
We just have to know that
we can solve for it.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.770
So one, alone, is
enough, right?

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.490
And you could, what?

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.090
If you multiply both sides
of this you get 12 steps.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.410
But anyway, we want to avoid
having to actually do math.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.420
We just want to figure out
whether we can do the math.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.950
Piece of information two, each
step is 1 foot wide.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.110
Well, that's clearly useless
because it doesn't tell us how

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.930
much altitude we're making on
each step and that's what you

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.930
have to figure out to say how
many steps you need to go up 9

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:41.940
feet in the air.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.310
So this is useless.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.600
So the answer is A: statement
one alone is sufficient.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.780
Next problem.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.820
48.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.790
If xy is equal to 0, oh,
does not equal 0.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.520
So that tells us that neither
x nor y is 0, right?

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.605
Is x divided by y going
to be less than 0?

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.810
In order for this to be true
one of these numbers-- so I

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.290
mean if x divided by y is
negative, that means that

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.200
either x or y, but not both of
them, are negative, right?

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.750
That's the only way you can
get a negative number when

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.350
you're dividing.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.540
If both of them are negative
this would

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.220
be a positive number.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.290
So let's see what we can do
with their information.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.660
Number one.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:53.300
x is equal to, and this is the
question, is xy less than 0?

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.950
And one says x is equal
to minus y.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.830
Well, immediately let's just
substitute that back in.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.010
If x is equal to minus
y then what's x/y?

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.520
x is equal to minus y, so you
have minus y/y and that will

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.120
equal-- and we know
y doesn't equal 0.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.330
So for any other value other
than 0-- if this was 0 this

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.030
would be undefined-- but then
this is equal to negative 1.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.980
So in this case x divided by y
is equal to negative 1, which

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.790
is definitely less than 0.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.320
So that proves our statement.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.250
So statement one alone
is all we need.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.160
Now let's see what statement
two gives us.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.460
I'll do it here.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.280
Statement two.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:46.540
Minus x is equal to minus y.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.600
So that tells us that minus x is
equal to y and then we can

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.450
just substitute the same
thing in again.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.890
Well, now we could substitute
for x, or we could just

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.710
multiply both sides by negative,
you get x is equal

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.550
to minus y, which is the same
thing as this here.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.730
So statement two, alone,
is also sufficient

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.630
to solve this problem.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.300
And so the answer is D: each
statement, alone, is

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.000
sufficient.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:20.300
Switch colors, problem 49.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.710
How many people are directors
of both company

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.100
k and company r?

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.120
OK.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:35.360
Directors of k and r.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.970
Statement number one.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.730
There were 17 directors present
at a joint meeting of

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.620
the directors of companies
k and r and no

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.350
directors were absent.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.880
At a joint meeting of the
directors, so that's all the

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.360
directors of k and r.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:02.530
So me draw some Venn Diagrams.
So if that is k and

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.580
then that is r.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.570
So they're saying that when
you add both of these

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.320
together, because this is a
joint meeting of all the

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.050
directors of both, we got 17.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.270
So there's 17 in this entire
universe of directors.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.590
That's what statement
one tells us.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.960
If you take this whole circle
and then you add up the

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.330
extra-- don't double count the
intersection-- you add up the

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.060
extra, you get 17.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.630
But that alone doesn't tell
us how many joint

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:32.300
directors there are.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.490
Joint directors are
these people.

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.760
People who are on the board
of both k and r.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.480
So this is k and this is r.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.020
So statement one alone
doesn't help us.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.070
Although, I'm suspecting, maybe
in conjunction with

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.950
something else, it could.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.640
Statement number two is company
k has 12 directors and

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.300
company r has 8 directors.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:06:06.870
OK. k is equal to 12 directors
and r is equal to 8 directors.

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:18.710
OK, so everything in the k
circle combined is 8, right?

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.250
Sorry, everything in the
k circle is 12, right?

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.580
k directors.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:27.110
Everything in the
r circle is 8.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:33.370
Now, if we wanted to get the
total of the k and the r-- so

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.090
by itself that doesn't tell
me how many overlap.

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:39.000
So when you take statement one
or statement two independently

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.370
that doesn't help us.

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.520
But what if we were to
figure out if we

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.290
would use them together?

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.810
So how many total directors
are there going to be?

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:51.570
There's going to be the total
directors in k-- so k's

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:57.010
directors-- plus the
director's in r.

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:00.470
But if you were to just add
those two up, you would double

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.700
count the people who are
in both k and r, right?

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.150
You would count them twice.

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:06.820
You would count them when
they're in k and you would

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.680
count them when they're in r.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.710
So if you wanted to figure out
how many total directors there

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:15.070
are you would then subtract out
the people who are in k

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:16.640
and r, right?

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.340
You don't want to subtract them
twice, you just don't

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.600
want to double count
them, right?

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.306
Because when you we do k plus
r you're counting them for k

00:07:22.306 --> 00:07:23.770
and then you're counting
them for r.

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:26.590
So let's subtract them out once
so that you only count

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.400
them for k or that you only
count them for r.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.660
You only count them once.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.730
So minus kr-- so this notation
that's people who

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:35.200
are in k and r.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.130
And what does that equal?

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.080
Well, statement one
told us that.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:43.170
It told us that they're
total of 17 directors.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:47.100
And so statement two told us
there are 12 directors in k

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:51.930
plus 8 directors in
r minus the joint

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.770
directors is equal to 17.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:55.590
And, by the way, we don't
even have to do this.

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.540
We could've just recognized
that if we know the total

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.160
number of directors and we know
how many are in each of

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.080
the groups that we can
figure it out.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.910
And we would just answer the
question that both statements

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:08.540
together are sufficient.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.690
But I'll just show you that we
can figure it out just so that

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:11.960
you're happy with it.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:17.400
Let's see, we get 20 minus
kr is equal to 17.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.920
And so you get kr
is equal to 3.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.560
So there are 3 directors that
overlap with both and we were

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.720
only able to answer that
question by using statement

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.630
one and statement two.

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:38.010
Next problem, 50.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:46.550
If x and y are positive
is xy greater than 1?

00:08:52.030 --> 00:09:01.760
Statement number one tells
us xy is greater then 1.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.000
So let's see, does that
help us at all?

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.030
And that's not obvious.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:09.760
That just tells us that x is
greater than 1/y or y is

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.360
greater than 1/x.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.770
So let's just think about it,
this statement is equivalent,

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.910
if we multiply both
sides by y.

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:17.950
And we can do that without
changing the inequality

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:21.020
because we know y is
greater than 0.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:25.820
So if we do that, we get
x is greater than y.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:27.710
If we can show this,
we can show that.

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:29.850
And remember, the only reason
why I didn't have to change

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:32.140
the inequality is because I knew
that when I'm multiplying

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:34.850
both sides by y, that
y is greater than 0.

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.500
If y was less than 0 I'd have to
switch the sign right here

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.190
when I multiply both
sides by it.

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:41.290
But anyway, if I can prove
x is greater than

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:42.360
y, we're all set.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.760
This doesn't help me.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:49.810
Let's see, statement number
two is x minus y is

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:51.180
greater than 0.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.020
Well, if I add y to
both sides of this

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:54.060
equation what do I get?

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:56.690
I get x is greater than y.

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:58.655
So this proves exactly what I
need to prove, and if you want

00:09:58.655 --> 00:10:00.590
to go all the way to what
originally they asked, divide

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:03.180
both sides by y-- and we don't
have to change the sign

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:07.160
because y is positive-- you
get x divided by y is

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:07.740
greater than 1.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.580
Which is exactly what
we needed to prove.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:14.730
So statement two, alone,
is sufficient.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:16.600
See you in the next video.
