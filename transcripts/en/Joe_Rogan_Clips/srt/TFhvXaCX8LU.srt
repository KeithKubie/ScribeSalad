1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,120
Because if like if you are one of those
crazy rock climber dudes like Alex

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,340
Honnold and he's crazy. He's crazy. I love
him though. He's told, have you talked?

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,960
Have you met him? Yeah, I've had him
on a couple of times. Oh my God. Yeah,

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:14,010
he's awesome. I'm sure he is. Of
course it's a big deal as fucked up.

5
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:17,160
You know this right when he has no fear.
No, he does have fear. You're wrong.

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,780
Oh really? Absolutely. As fear.

7
00:00:18,781 --> 00:00:22,530
He just understands his capacity and
his ability you think is he says,

8
00:00:22,531 --> 00:00:23,191
I can do this,

9
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:26,430
therefore I should not be afraid cause
I read that he takes scanned his brain

10
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:29,970
and that his, his fear
centers are different than
the rest of us is what I read.

11
00:00:29,971 --> 00:00:30,960
Maybe that's wrong.
I don't know.

12
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,080
Did he tell you he didn't say anything
about that? I think he's just,

13
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:39,750
I don't know about that man.
He said basically that the experience,

14
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:44,430
he just stays mellow and calm and then
if things go wrong, it's really bad.

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,200
Like you don't want to be freaking out.
Yes. It's still, he doesn't divers.

16
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,700
You don't panic when you're underwater.
And you lose your way. Right.

17
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:53,940
There was a consumes oxygen.

18
00:00:53,941 --> 00:00:56,700
A lot of amazing story that
my friend Donald Cerrone,

19
00:00:56,701 --> 00:01:00,370
he's a UFC fighter told about
being trapped in a cave in, in,

20
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,080
in this bigger watering out when
it was running out of oxygen. Yeah.

21
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,120
Horrible, crazy, scary story. And you have
those guys are also different. These are,

22
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:11,910
they either they're born that
way or they learn to be that way.

23
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,480
You have to keep calm because when
you and I lose our cool and start

24
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:18,810
hyperventilating, our auction
consumption skyrockets. Right.

25
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,390
And that's the opposite of what
you need to do in that situation.

26
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,790
It's actually what he talked about,
you know,

27
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:27,110
like trying to stay calm and
battling the demons. Yeah.

28
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,980
Not going to die like this. Yes.
Yeah. What an incredible story. Yeah.

29
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,850
The Alex Honnold thing, I or something, I
watched the movie, what it talks to them.

30
00:01:35,851 --> 00:01:38,890
He got an MRI and they said that he was
quote, what did it say? Yeah, he's a,

31
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:41,430
Migdal is different, but what
did it say? How does it say it?

32
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,820
The kids Amygdala isn't firing. Yes. Okay.

33
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,050
But isn't that possible that that's
just through development of constant,

34
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,630
it is also possible calm while you're in
life threatening situations as possible.

35
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,640
And they would like to see fighters
brains measured in that regard.

36
00:01:56,641 --> 00:02:01,410
I would like to see soldiers, special
forces guys. Yes, I think that's right.

37
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:02,880
And the guy's a special force guys.

38
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:07,110
It's like the capacity to shoot back when
you're being shot at keeping your calm

39
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,170
moving positions, you know, and so forth.

40
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:13,270
Those are all very important to
abilities, not panicking. Uh,

41
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,080
but and it is also the case
that some people, for example,

42
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:19,290
the most famous study in this regard
was a study of London taxi drivers.

43
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,890
London taxi drivers can go from any point
in the city to any other point in the

44
00:02:22,891 --> 00:02:24,480
city.
It's called the knowledge.

45
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,050
They have a mental map of the
whole city and it's freakish.

46
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,060
It takes years to be able to know how to
navigate the city with the thousands of

47
00:02:33,061 --> 00:02:34,770
Nate,
tens of thousands of street names.

48
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,520
And they can do it by like dead reckoning.
They a scan.

49
00:02:38,521 --> 00:02:42,270
This was a paper about 10 years ago.
They brain scan these guys and they had,

50
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,470
I forgot what region of the brain,

51
00:02:43,471 --> 00:02:48,450
but they had through learning it is
felt modify that region of the brain.

52
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,680
So it's possible.

53
00:02:49,681 --> 00:02:53,720
Holland is like you say that he learned
to be this way that does it make dull

54
00:02:53,721 --> 00:02:58,500
isn't firing because he trained himself
but I Honolulu, Honolulu huddled,

55
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,140
I'm sorry Hahnel does this way because
he learns to me but it's more likely I

56
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:07,141
think that he's like Usain bolt
that was born with incredibly a high

57
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:12,160
preponderance of fast twitch fibers in
his leg so he can run like the wind and

58
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:13,900
he trains as well. You have both, right?

59
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:18,730
Good athletes require both innate ability
plus training. Yes, and I think uh,

60
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,670
handled is probably like that.
He was probably born with an Amygdala,

61
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:25,810
doesn't fire so much and
he's an amazing climber.

62
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,700
It's purely speculative,
right? Like the end. They also,

63
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:30,610
the nature versus nurture would
apply to chess players as well.

64
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:35,500
I would like to see their brains can
like Gary Casbar off. I know Gary. Yes.

65
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,120
I would love to see that. I got brain
scan. Yes. Yeah. He's an interesting guy.

66
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:39,861
What I'll say.

67
00:03:39,861 --> 00:03:43,190
The article goes way more into depth
and Nyquil I just showed you about just

68
00:03:43,191 --> 00:03:46,280
that sentence. She, she's at
the doctor who studied them.

69
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:50,450
It was specifically looks at people that
go under high stress and look for those

70
00:03:50,451 --> 00:03:54,350
kinds of things. She's been doing that
since 2005 I guess, and she goes, it's,

71
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,700
it's pages long. This whole thing
about his brain, but it is unusual,

72
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,540
but it also, the amount of time, think
about people that are in high stress.

73
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:03,710
High stress is one thing.

74
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:08,980
This kid is in a life threatening
absolute fatality situation.

75
00:04:10,691 --> 00:04:15,470
Mistake his death every
day. I know all day. I know.

76
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,750
I mean, he lives in a van and just
climbs. Yes. That's what he does.

77
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:24,440
It's really fast. Yes it is.
It is. It's amazing. Honestly.
It's amazing. So I mean,

78
00:04:24,441 --> 00:04:27,760
I don't know. I'd never met him. I
admire him very much. And I love this.

79
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,010
Like we said at the beginning,
it's very important to have skills.
