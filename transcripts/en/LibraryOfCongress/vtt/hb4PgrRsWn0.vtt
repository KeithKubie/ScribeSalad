00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.350
&gt;&gt; Eun Yang: This marks the
16th year of the festival

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.860
and the 5th year of the contest,
which would not be possible

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.370
without the hard work of
all the festival people

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:16.670
who are working on it.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.150
As I mentioned, Lola and Brianna.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.640
And we really want to present
this in a two-part series.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.570
First, we want to honor
the winners of A Book

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.300
that Shaped Me national book
festival summer writing contest

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.090 position:56%
and then we will hear from the
winners of letters about literature.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.070
It's the library's
national writing contest.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.750
And in the middle of the program
we'll be joined by a special guest,

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.970
so you'll have to stay
tuned for that.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.550
A Book that Shaped Me was launched
by the Library of Congress in 2012

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.090
with DC Public Library and has

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.130
since expanded throughout
the mid-Atlantic region.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.160
The contests asks rising 5th and
6th graders to reflect on a book

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.750
that has shaped their lives,

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.540
influencing the way they see
themselves, their communities

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.330
or their world and
books certainly do that.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.840 position:56%
Students entered by writing a one
page essay, which sometimes is hard,

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.810
you know, you think writing
a 10 page essay is hard try

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.180
and put all your thoughts in
a compact way is hard as well.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.060
And then they submitted in person
to participating public library

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.560
in Washington, DC, Maryland,
Virginia, Delaware, Pennsylvania

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.710
or West Virginia, so
this is a big contest.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.640
Over the years nearly 800 essays
have been submitted to the more

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.780 position:56%
than 350 public libraries that have
signed up to administer this contest

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.050
as a part of their
summer reading programs.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.100
The essays are then judged
by the American Association

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.270
of School Librarians and later

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.500
by a grand prize panel
of judges, tough job.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.250
And of course, one of
the people that had

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.590
that very tough is Fred
Bowen who joins us now.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.630
He is a sports writer for the
Washington Post Kids Post.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.560
We love the Kids Post
in my house too Fred.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.250 position:56%
And he's been one of the grand prize
judges since the contest began.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.090
This year A Book that Shaped
Me received nearly 300 entries,

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.390
I love that.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.550

finalists and state winners

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.200

finalists by state and then Lola

Keep on reading, keep on writing,
it's just a wonderful thing to do.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.650
You know, I was talking
about my kids.

The boys, the two older
boys like math

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.810

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.050
I'm like if you want
to write essays,

as much as they love reading.

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.300

&gt;&gt; Fred Bowen: Thank you, that's
right my name is Fred Bowen and yes,

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:46.050
I have written 21 sports books
that combine sports fiction,

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.050
sports history and
there's always a chapter

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:50.340
of sports history at the back.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:55.540 position:56%
And I also write a weekly kid sports
column for the Washington Post.

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.090
But what I'm very proud
that I've been doing

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:01.360
for the last five years is
I've been one of the judges

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.610
in A Book that Shaped Me.

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:08.050
And one of things and that means
you read quite a few essays and one

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:09.470
of the things I have noticed

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:14.610
over the years we are not only
getting more essays we are getting

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:16.240
better essays.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.850
The kids do a wonderful job.

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:21.540
In fact, I'm starting
to get a little nervous

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:24.100
because I think there's going
to be a lot of competition

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:27.170
out there with book writers.

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:31.010
But I don't do this
all by myself I'd

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:32.940 position:56%
like to see if anybody is out there.

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:37.250
We have my fellow judges
Maria Salvador is she

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:41.970
out there and Rachel Walker.

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:44.510
There she is back there
let's give them a hand.

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:52.320
Also helping us this year was
Jason Reynolds who's a wonderful,

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:57.820
wonderful author who will
actually be speaking here at 4:45.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:01.820
So if you can hang around really
stay he's a wonderful author

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.690
and I would encourage
everybody to see him speak.

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:09.260
And I also would encourage
everybody to read his excellent

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:13.250
and very timely book
All-American Boys.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:16.620
Now what we're going to do
is we'll present the awards

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.120
for the grand prize winners.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:23.940
I'm going to introduce the winners,
then they will read their essays

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:28.230
and then I'll ask them a few
questions about their essay.

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:34.030

wonderful Dr. Seuss.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.510
Would you please come up?

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:45.040
[ Applause ]

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.900
Mikayla is the third
place grand prize winner

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.320
and the Pennsylvania State winner.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:57.550
So step up to the microphone
and read everybody your essay.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.920
&gt;&gt; Mikayla Phasupong: As a
small child my mom read a story

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.220
to me numerous times.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:05.180
I never knew that it would
change me for the better.

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:07.630
Now I read it to my
younger siblings.

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:10.860
The book that shaped me is
the Sneetches by Dr. Seuss.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:16.590 position:56%
It may be silly that a story written

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:20.320
for small children is a
book which has shaped me.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:25.820
However, the Sneetches teach people
valuable lessons about equality

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.890
and diversity that
even adults may need

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:32.010
to be reminded of once in a while.

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:37.070 position:56%
This story starts off with bird-like
creatures some have stars upon their

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:39.620
bellies and some don't.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:42.590
For some reason the star
belly sneetches feel

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:47.680
that they are superior to
the plain belly sneetches.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.850
The star belly sneetches
leave out the plain-bellies

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:52.710
from their fun and games.

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:54.350 position:56%
Even the children were not permitted

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:58.900
to play games unless there
was a star upon their stomach.

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:02.670
Then one day a fix-it-up
chappie comes along with an odd

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:04.420
yet one of a kind machine.

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:09.930
For a small fee the machine
put a star on the stomach

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:11.810
of a plain belly sneetch.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:16.840
Of course, the star
bellies lined up thrilled.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:22.120
They all thought about how they
had a chance to be special.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:28.850
When the star bellies found out
about the plain belly sneetches

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.050
and their stars they
were very unhappy.

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:36.740
So that fix-it-up chappie
made another odd

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.310
yet one-of-a-kind machine.

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:42.630
This one took off their
stars from their stomachs.

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:47.020
So of course, the star belly
sneetches went through.

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:50.650
They had to stay different so
that they could remain superior.

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:54.840
But the plain belly sneetches and
the star belly sneetches went round

00:13:54.840 --> 00:14:00.430
and round, in again, out again
until no one knew who was who.

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:02.360
Finally, they came to realize

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:06.780
that they were all equal
regardless of their stars.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:09.480
That day all the sneetches
forgot about their stars

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.220
and whether they had
one or not upon Mars.

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:17.170 position:56%
The Sneetches was published in 1961.

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:25.870
This was during the Civil Rights
Movement, which eventually ended

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:28.360
in the segregation of blacks.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:33.020
Dr. Seuss also served in the United
States Army during World War 2

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:37.570
in which many Jews
tragically lost their lives.

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:43.330
It is safe to say that Dr. Seuss
witnessed his fair share of racism,

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:47.890
discrimination and overall
struggles for equality.

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:55.650
I believe Dr. Seuss used the stars
in his story as a symbol of race,

00:14:55.650 --> 00:15:00.960
religion, gender, disability
and any other characteristics

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:05.870
which may have made us
different from one another.

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:08.450
Those stars weren't so
big, they weren't really

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:11.960
so small you might think such
a thing wouldn't matter at all.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:17.050
Dr. Seuss one wanted his readers
young and adult to realize

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:21.000
that we are all equal
regardless of our stars.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.720
This story shaped me because
I learned early to be kind

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:27.140 position:56%
to others regardless of their stars.

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:31.210
After all, our stars are what
makes every one of us unique.

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:36.450
Our stars most certainly
should not divide us apart.

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:40.470
I learned from this book that
we need to be kind to each other

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:44.650 position:56%
and accept each other's differences.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:49.430
If each of us could be a
little kinder to one another

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:54.900
and celebrate our differences the
world would be a much better place.

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:59.500
Even just a simple smile or a wave
hello could help make one person's

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:00.800
day brighter.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.490
They might even pass it on.

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:05.730
Step-by-step our kind heartedness

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:08.260
and compassion can shape
the world for the better.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:13.800
I am thankful that my mom read
this story to me as a young child.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:17.120
It has made me a better
person and more aware

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.320
of how I treat other people.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:24.480
I would like to thank Dr.
Seuss for writing this story

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.060
with such a valuable lesson.

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.510
Has this story shaped you?

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:38.080

&gt;&gt; Fred Bowen: Well
that was wonderful.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.300 position:56%
Dr. Seuss has written lots of books.

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:48.840
Now have you read other books,
is he one of your favorites?

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.140
&gt;&gt; Mikayla Phasupong: Yes.

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:52.640
&gt;&gt; Fred Bowen: Oh okay, can you
remember any of the favorites

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:55.450
of Dr. Seuss because I
remember the one that I love

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:59.120
and that is Horton Hatches
the Egg did you ever?

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.420
&gt;&gt; Mikayla Phasupong: Yeah.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:01.720
&gt;&gt; Fred Bowen: Read that one?

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.020
&gt;&gt; Mikayla Phasupong: Uh-hm.

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:04.320
&gt;&gt; Fred Bowen: Right I remember
that what it was that Horton says,

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:07.600
he says I meant what I said

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:13.530
and I said what I meant an
elephant's faithful 100%.

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:20.190
Now what other Dr. Seuss books
did you enjoy, do you remember?

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:22.900
&gt;&gt; Mikayla Phasupong:
Green Eggs and Ham.

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:29.370
I think he has a newer book
out I forget the title.

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:34.150 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Fred Bowen: Oh yeah, where you'll
go or stuff like that all right.

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:38.280
Now your mom reads to you or
did you say you now read to one

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.200
of your younger siblings?

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.640
&gt;&gt; Mikayla Phasupong:
My mom read that to me

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.230
as a child and now I read it to.

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:46.530

you still remember it.

Well you gave a wonderful reading
of the essay that was just terrific.

about the Lightning
Thief by Rick Riordan.

&gt;&gt; Fred Bowen: Pull
it a little bit up.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.530
Maybe like that, step right up.

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:49.240
&gt;&gt; Julia Lucy Grumet: So first
I would like to thank everybody

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:54.510
who supported me and helped
me to write this essay.

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:59.530
To most people the Lightning Thief
is mainly about people fighting --

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:05.020
to most people the
Lightning Thief is mainly

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:08.680
about people fighting monsters
and going on magical quests.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.920
I'm not saying that's false I'm
just saying there's more to it.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:16.140
A year before I read the
Lightning Thief I was diagnosed

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:18.670
with attention deficit
hyper disorder ADHD.

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:22.700
The diagnosis made me feel
lonely like I was the only person

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.350
in the world who had ADHD.

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:26.430
It made me feel insecure.

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:30.810
Then I read the Lightning Thief.

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:35.680
When I first learned Percy the
main character had ADHD I wanted

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:42.840 position:56%
to put the book down, I did not like
the sound of that word in my head

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:46.330
or the fact that I had it.

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:48.440
Those letters on the
page bothered me.

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:54.420
It seems as if the letters were
in caps lock just to catch my eye.

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:58.700
I remembered staring at it for a
minute and almost closing the book.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:02.540
Later in the book when I figured

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:08.160
out another character Annabeth
also had ADHD I felt even more

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.320
uncomfortable than before.

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:14.620
I felt exposed and as if by reading
the book everybody would realize

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:15.920
that I had ADHD.

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:19.290
Eventually I began
to get used to it.

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:23.080
Then seeing the word on the book
made me want to keep reading it.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:29.020 position:56%
Almost all of the amazing characters
had ADHD, especially the demigods.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:32.810
The book taught me that ADHD
could be a gift not a punishment.

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:38.440 position:56%
The book was inspiring and it showed
me all the great things about ADHD.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:44.320
The Lightning Thief made
having ADHD sound awesome.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:49.020
It describes what it
is and its advantages.

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:52.720
For example, Annabeth
talks about it saying

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:56.790
and the ADHD you're impulsive, you
can't sit still in a classroom,

00:20:56.790 --> 00:21:01.070 position:56%
that's your battle reflexes in a
regular fight they'd keep you alive.

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:03.830
Percy, the main character,
is impulsive

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:09.410
but heroic, fidgety but quick.

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:16.060
The other kids in my class who
were reading the book wanted ADHD.

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.580
After reading the Lightning
Thief I felt more confident

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:20.110
about having ADHD.

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:23.560
In school I felt less embarrassed
and it helped me feel more similar

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.860
to the other kids in my class.

00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:42.440
These relations helped
me make more friends

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:48.690 position:56%
because I was no longer afraid that
people would find out about my ADHD.

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:52.100
I felt braver which made
it easier to raise my hand

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:56.570
and participate in
class discussions.

00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:59.760
Annabeth is good at putting clues
together to figure out a puzzle.

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:03.880
For example, she realizes
that a woman in glasses

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.680
who make sculptures
is actually Medusa.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:09.290
In reading class I'm aware
of my creative instincts

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:11.850
and ability to see relationships.

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:16.210 position:56%
Like Annabeth this creative thinking
leads me to predict plot twists

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:19.430
and understand what motivates
different characters.

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:23.130
The Lightning Thief helped
me realize the gifts of ADHD,

00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:27.300
including the quick reaction
time which assists me with soccer

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:30.940
and baseball since my
reflexes are swift.

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:36.420
ADHD also helps my reaction times

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:42.990
in science class when
I make connections.

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:47.150
For example, when we
were programming robots

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:53.280
to navigate a simple maze
I was able to use evidence

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:56.020
from the previous robot challenge

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:58.660
to quickly calculate
how to program my robot.

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:02.820
This is similar to when
Annabeth was successful

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:08.120
in playing a virtual city
game in the lotus casino.

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:12.360
The Lightning Thief made
it obvious that lots

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.470
of people in the world have ADHD.

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:15.770
I'm not alone.

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:17.880
Having ADHD has a bright side.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.370
This book shaped me to become
a more confident person

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:22.510
and accept every part of myself.

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:33.880
[ Applause ]

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:38.720 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Fred Bowen: So after you read the
book now do you tell your friends

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:41.620
that you have ADHD now that
you've told all these people,

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:43.600
it doesn't seem like
it bothers you anymore?

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.240
&gt;&gt; Julia Lucy Grumet: No, not
really I kind of got over it.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.540
&gt;&gt; Fred Bowen: Yeah
you kind of got --

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:49.900
it does seem like you got over it.

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:52.580
One thing I was wondering is
the book is a fantasy book,

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:54.530
do you like fantasy books?

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:55.830
&gt;&gt; Julia Lucy Grumet: Yeah.

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:57.130
&gt;&gt; Fred Bowen: All
right now I don't,

00:23:57.130 --> 00:24:04.940 position:56%
so explain to me why fantasy books
are so cool kind of like ADHD right?

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:06.240
&gt;&gt; Julia Lucy Grumet: Okay,

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:11.110
so fantasy books I find them
more interesting no offense

00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:19.880
because like you can have anything
happen like a hippopotamus can ride

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.550
on a unicorn and it's totally okay.

00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:26.110
But in nonfiction that
won't be true,

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:27.770
therefore, I like fiction better.

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:29.970
&gt;&gt; Fred Bowen: All right,
well I can see that.

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:32.680
In fact, I think you've
convinced me.

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:35.930
&gt;&gt; Julia Lucy Grumet: Thank you.

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:37.230
&gt;&gt; Fred Bowen: You may
have convinced me to go out

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:38.530
and buy some fantasy
books all right.

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:40.510
You've done a great job, thank you.

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:46.050
[ Applause ]

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:47.350
Great job.

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:55.650
All right, would Rachel Smookler
from Newcastle County Libraries

00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:59.870
and she wrote on Jack
and Louisa Act One

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:03.700
by Andrew Keenan-Bolger
and Kate Wetherhead.

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:05.500
Please come up.

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:13.170
[ Applause ]

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:17.150
&gt;&gt; Rachel Smookler: How Jack
and Louisa Act 1 shaped me.

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:20.460
As the lights came up
I saw the blurred faces

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:23.470
of the audience staring at
me in the bright spotlight.

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:28.230
As I exhaled all of my
nervousness whooshed out of me

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:29.530
like a deflating balloon.

00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:34.530
When I inhaled excitement
took its place as I prepared

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:38.020
to sing the first note
of the opening song.

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:41.410
This was the beginning of act one.

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:45.080
Last summer I never could have
imagined myself performing

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:47.500
in front of hundreds of people.

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:50.220
At my old school my
classmates labeled me

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:53.690
as the shy girl who barely talked.

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:56.960
My family was moving over the
summer from Maryland to Delaware

00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:02.490
and my main goal was to change
that label at my new school.

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:07.730
After the move books were
my best and only friends.

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:11.310
Like a rabbit hiding from the
world in its hole I stayed

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:14.560
in my room and shut out the world.

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:18.300
Jack and Louisa Act 1
by Andrew Keenan-Bolger

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:23.700
and Kate Wetherhead
helped me out of my hole.

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:27.210
When I started reading
this book all of my sadness

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:31.050
and loneliness flew away like
birds flying free in the wind.

00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:35.220
I was transported on
stage singing a song

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:37.580
from into the woods
with Jack and Louisa.

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:43.860
In the book Jack reluctantly moved
from exciting New York City life

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:48.350
as a Broadway actor to a
boring suburban life in Ohio.

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:52.070
He missed all of the familiar
activities in New York,

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:54.520
such as picnicking in Central Park

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:57.120
and eating ice-cream
on the Hudson River.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:03.140
After moving I felt -- he was
also sad not to attend 7th grade

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:08.700
at the Professional
Performing Arts School.

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:12.160
After moving I felt the same way.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.930
I missed my favorite
Maryland activities,

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:19.550
such as eating mint
chocolate chip ice-cream

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:28.230
at the Annapolis Ice-cream Company,
enjoying the beach with friends

00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:35.000
and devouring blue crabs at
local seafood restaurants.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:42.330
Jack and Louisa Act 1 helped me
to feel less alone since it was

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:47.720
about another kid going through
the same challenges as me.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:55.150
Reading the book also made
me curious about Broadway.

00:27:55.150 --> 00:28:04.360
I started looking up songs from
musicals and listening to them.

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:13.220
Soon I became what Louisa
calls a musical theater nerd,

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:15.870
someone who is obsessed
with musical theater.

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:19.070
I dusted off my mom's
old Secret Garden CD.

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:22.280
When I listened I immediately
fell in love

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:29.150
with the mysterious ghostly songs.

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:34.710
My parents got so tired of me
playing the soundtrack nonstop

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:40.010
that they begged me to
turn it off just like Jack

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:45.550
and Louisa's parents did whenever
they played Into the Woods.

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:49.550
When winter arrived the
opportunity to change my label

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:53.600
and explore my interest in
musical theater came along.

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.700
I mustered every bit
of courage I had

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:59.700
and auditioned for
my school's musical.

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:03.600
By then I had made many
friends besides Jack

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:04.900
and Louisa at my new school.

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:08.960
I even encouraged some of my
friends to audition with me.

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.690
With the courage that Jack
and Louisa gave me I felt

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:11.990
like I could do anything.

00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:13.290
When my turn to audition came I
felt all my nervousness disappear.

00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:14.680
That weekend I was thrilled to find
out I was cast as the narrator.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:16.030
I knew that I had achieved
my goal to change my label.

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:17.330
I wasn't a shy girl
who had lost her voice,

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:18.820 position:56%
but an actress whose voice will be
heard throughout a large auditorium.

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:20.120
My school's musical was a success

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.420
and before the curtain fell
I gave Jack and Louisa a bow

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:22.720
in my imagination for
helping me in so many ways.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.040
This book helped me to find
and explore my new passion

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:25.840 position:56%
for musical theater and to learn
that change can bring new adventures

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:27.140
and exciting opportunities.

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:28.940
It also gave me the courage to
show the world my true self.

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:36.050
[ Applause ]

00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:38.000
&gt;&gt; Fred Bowen: Well that
was wonderful Rachel.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.400
Now I don't know much about
the book and I don't know much

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:46.660
about musical theater, but we do
have two people in the audience

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:49.810
who know a great deal
about the book.

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:53.780
Because the authors,
Andrew Keenan-Bolger

00:29:53.780 --> 00:30:00.080
and Kate Wetherhead are
here and they were thrilled

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:01.700
about you winning the contest.

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:07.510
So I think we should have them come
up and ask the questions of Rachel.

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:22.090
[ Applause ]

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:23.390
&gt;&gt; Kate Wetherhead:
That was wonderful.

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:24.690
&gt;&gt; Andrew Keenan-Bolger:
That was amazing.

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:28.990
&gt;&gt; Kate Wetherhead: What do we
do we ask the questions here?

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:30.430
&gt;&gt; Fred Bowen: Yeah go
ahead what's the question?

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:32.360
&gt;&gt; Kate Wetherhead: Hi,
congratulations that was beautiful.

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.660
&gt;&gt; Rachel Smookler: Thank you.

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:34.960 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Andrew Keenan-Bolger: I know that
this competition is called a Book

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.440
that Shaped You, but honestly as
authors you stare at a blank screen

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:41.060
and you never can really know
what the impact is going to be.

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:45.230
And so getting to be here and
seeing this it really is the prize

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:46.530
for us as well.

00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:48.480
It's really, really generous.

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.490
&gt;&gt; Kate Wetherhead: Yeah
and congratulations to all

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:53.550
of the winners today, it's
just a thrill for us to be here

00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:54.850
and to celebrate with you

00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:58.980
and the two other essays were
just fantastic, so congrats.

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:01.990
So we're supposed to ask
you some questions I guess.

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:04.330
What was the name of
the show that you did

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:05.630
that you were the narrator for?

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:07.050
&gt;&gt; Rachel Smookler: Aladdin Junior.

00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:08.350
&gt;&gt; Kate Wetherhead: Awesome.

00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:09.650
&gt;&gt; Andrew Keenan-Bolger: Cool.

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:10.950
&gt;&gt; Kate Wetherhead: Do you know
that this guy was in Aladdin

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:12.630
at one point, you did a
production of Aladdin?

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:13.930
&gt;&gt; Andrew Keenan-Bolger:
Yeah, indeed.

00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:15.230
&gt;&gt; Kate Wetherhead: And so okay.

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:16.530
&gt;&gt; Rachel Smookler: I
didn't know about that.

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:18.520 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Kate Wetherhead: So tell us now
-- first of all, I'm so proud of you

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:22.310
for facing your fears,
that's such a big deal.

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:26.620
What is it now about performing
that you like the best?

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:31.150
&gt;&gt; Rachel Smookler: I like
singing it's just like I love music

00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:36.690
and I love singing with my mom
and we both just loving singing,

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:42.300
so it's really fun for
me and for her too so.

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:43.600
&gt;&gt; Kate Wetherhead: Awesome.

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:44.900
&gt;&gt; Andrew Keenan-Bolger: Now
Jack and Louisa it's a book

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:50.160
about friendship I think mostly
and especially about an outsider

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:53.330
who meets that one friend
who has a shared passion

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:55.590
that really it changes the game.

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:58.610
Did you feel like when you moved
to your new place that there was

00:31:58.610 --> 00:32:02.610
that one friend who really
changed your life and if you want

00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:05.120
to give a shout out
to them right now?

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:08.520
&gt;&gt; Rachel Smookler: Yeah,
I met a lot of friends,

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:15.960
but after I auditioned the
musical I met a girl name Neve

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:19.540
and we just both really,
really love Broadway and we

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:26.040
like singing it together and it was
just really great to have her so.

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.270
&gt;&gt; Kate Wetherhead: I have
one last question and that is

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:30.610
when are you going to
come visit us in New York?

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:32.970
&gt;&gt; Rachel Smookler: I am trying --

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:40.150
I am in the process of trying to
get my parents to let me see a show

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:44.090
on Broadway for my birthday so.

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:45.390
&gt;&gt; Andrew Keenan-Bolger:
Well you need to hit us

00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:47.880
up because chances are
we can find some way

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:49.770 position:56%
to bring you backstage of that show.

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:51.070
&gt;&gt; Kate Wetherhead: Yeah.

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:52.770
&gt;&gt; Andrew Keenan-Bolger:
And parents,

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:54.780
I feel like this would
be a really nice reward

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.080
for writing such a beautiful essay.

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:57.380
&gt;&gt; Kate Wetherhead:
Yeah, no pressure but.

00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:01.760
&gt;&gt; Andrew Keenan-Bolger: Hint,
hint her birthday's coming up.

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.280
Thank you so much Rachel.

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:04.580 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Kate Wetherhead: Yeah, thank you.

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:06.470
&gt;&gt; Rachel Smookler: Bye, bye.

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:12.360
Thank you.

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:13.660
&gt;&gt; Congratulations.

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:17.290
&gt;&gt; Eun Yang: Congratulations,
oh my gosh.

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:19.670
What just happened
between Kate and Andrew

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:25.020
and Rachel is why the National Book
Festival is as wonderful as it is.

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:28.690
What a special moment and when
people books change lives it's not

00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:30.030
just something we say.

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:32.130
These essays that were
just written read

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:36.820
by these wonderful finalists just
evidence of how they change lives

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:39.970
and how they impact I hope every
single one of us in the audience.

00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:43.480 position:56%
Thank you so much for your beautiful
writing and for sharing with us.

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:46.210
Can we give another
round of applause?

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:49.580
Thank you so much.

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:52.620
What a wonderful surprise, thank
you for being here, it's go great.

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:54.450
All right, so I believe
we also have someone here

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:57.640
from the Delaware division of
libraries who traveled up here

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.700
to also congratulate you.

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:02.150
Is Patty Langley here?

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:03.450
Is Patty here?

00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:04.750
Oh thank you for coming.

00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:08.030
Can you stand up to be
recognized, thank you for coming?

00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:13.000
Thank you Fred and you
have fans in my house.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.060
I know they like fantasy okay.

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:21.260

history she is the first woman

00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:45.510

wonderful moment together.

about this is Pam Jackson,

00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:32.370

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:34.170
Pam.

00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:44.200
[ Applause ]

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.500
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Good afternoon.

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:52.020 position:56%
So thank you, it's a pleasure to be
here and to celebrate youth literacy

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:54.780
in such a fun and exciting way.

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:58.460 position:56%
The Letters About Literature program
is a reading and writing contest

00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:01.120 position:56%
for students in grades 4 through 12.

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:05.640
Students are asked to read a book,
poem or a speech and to write

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:09.380
to the author about how the
book affected them personally.

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:14.140
And letters are judged on
state and national levels.

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:18.910
More than 50,000 students from
across the country enter Letters

00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:20.830
About Literature each year.

00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:24.320
Teachers and librarians support
the process and receive training

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:27.420
and guidance to fulfill the
intentions of the program.

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:29.470
So as we begin to celebrate
the winners

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:34.570
of this year's contest allow me to
say more about our special guest,

00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:37.350
Carla Hayden, who was sworn
in as the new Librarian

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:40.510
of Congress just 10 days ago.

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:44.040
[ Applause ]

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:47.200
What a way to begin
her work -- her tenure.

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:50.870
So she's a former children's
librarian and most recently

00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:54.520
at Enoch Pratt Free Library
in Baltimore as its CEO

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.000
for more than two decades.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.670
And she brings with her a level of
energy and excitement for reading

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:03.610
and knowledge and she
has a particular passion

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:06.060
for so many aspects
of the work we do.

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:08.930
So we're thrilled to
have her with us today

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:12.470
to honor all the youth
participants in the writing contest

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:15.550
and to share her thoughts about
the importance of reading.

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:17.320
Carla Hayden.

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:20.070
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Thank you.

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:23.620
Congratulations to all the
winners and to everyone

00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:27.110
that entered the writing
contest, A Book that Shaped Me

00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:29.040
and Letters About Literature.

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:33.580
I have to tell you as I was
listening to our winners talk

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:37.910
about the books that shape
me I thought about the book

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:41.690
that did shape me, it
was called Bright April

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:43.550
and I was seven years old.

00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:49.230 position:56%
And I walked into a storefront
library across from PS96 in Jamaica,

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:54.060 position:56%
Queens and I don't know who put this
book in my hand, but somebody knew

00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:57.650
that a little brown
girl with pigtails who

00:39:57.650 --> 00:40:02.570
and I don't think they knew I was
a brownie would love a book called

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:03.870
Bright April.

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:08.730
Because I saw myself in that book
and even to this day whenever I see

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:13.660
that book and I have a copy I
hug it and I smile because I knew

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:16.310
if I could see myself in a book

00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:19.640
that was something I
wanted to share with others.

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:23.060 position:56%
Now more than a million of
students participated in the Library

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:25.830
of Congress Letters
About Literature contest

00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:27.970
and we are especially grateful

00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:32.310
to the supporters Dollar
General Literacy Foundation

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:35.400
for their support two
years in a row.

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:43.300
Tonight and today and this
festival has been a whirlwind.

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:47.420
We are celebrating people
and young people who write

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:49.730
about what books mean to them.

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:54.940
And so we're going to bring up
the winners and hear from them.

00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:08.430
Are you going to do it?

00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:10.270
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:13.660
I think it was mentioned that I've
only been sworn in for 10 days.

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:16.350
&gt;&gt; I would defer it to
the Librarian of Congress.

00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:19.800
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: However, I
have used this opportunity

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.620
to be new to say, can I do that.

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:22.920
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.220
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Can I do that.

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:26.430
So I just happen to have
the list of the winners.

00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:27.730
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:29.120
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And I'm
going to take privilege.

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:32.320
I might not be able to do
this a hundred days from now.

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:37.080 position:56%
But I'd like to be able because I
see your name was there [inaudible].

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:39.340
&gt;&gt; Oh no, I want [inaudible].

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:43.770
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: To announce
the national winners of Letters

00:41:43.770 --> 00:41:45.510
About Literature contest.

00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:50.380
First, Aleema Kelly
from Connecticut,

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:55.540
level one national winner for 4
through 6 grade reading a portion

00:41:55.540 --> 00:42:01.690
of her letter to Alex Gino
about the book George.

00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:09.850
&gt;&gt; Aleema Kelly: Hello.

00:42:09.850 --> 00:42:11.990
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:15.620
&gt;&gt; Aleema Kelly: Almost
everybody left okay.

00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:22.330
Dear Alex Gino, your book George
has inspired me in many ways.

00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:25.210
It got me thinking about
how life is not fair,

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:26.740
especially to specific groups

00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:30.140
of people I hadn't have really
ever thought about before,

00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:33.300
people that are unable
to really be themselves.

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:35.790
It also inspired me
to be true to myself

00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:40.280 position:56%
and not let anyone's expectations or
judgments make me change who I am.

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:42.700
Your book made me think more

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:45.990
about how life can pose
totally unexpected problems

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:48.220
that are very hard to deal with.

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:53.590 position:56%
George was born in a boy's body, but
he feels like he's really a girl.

00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:57.360
He worried whether his own mom
would still love and accept him

00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:00.500
for who he felt he
really was if he told her.

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:03.540
He couldn't be himself with friends
and classmates, which caused him

00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:06.750
to limit his friends to only one.

00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:09.700
People shouldn't have to be scared
of what people think of them,

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:11.850 position:56%
especially their own family members.

00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:15.560
In your book when George
told his mom he felt

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:18.240
like a girl she couldn't accept it.

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:21.240
Mothers are supposed to
love you no matter what even

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:24.010
if you aren't what they
hoped you would be.

00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:25.920 position:56%
When I thought about that I realized

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:29.060
when George's mom didn't
accept him he sort of shut down

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:32.100
and he became discouraged.

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:35.160
After I read this book I thought
about how it's not a bad thing

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:39.540 position:56%
if a girl says that she's a tomboy
and she can enjoy the outdoors, run,

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:42.860
climb and like sports, and the
more traditional boy colors

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:44.360
like blue and green.

00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:48.560
A tomboy is usually seen
as a positive trait.

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:52.580
On the other hand, if a boy says
that he wants to do ballet, sewing,

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:54.640
playing with dolls
or that he likes pink

00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:58.500
or purple he'll risk being teased
and not being accepted by others.

00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:02.830
I don't think that's fair
and it doesn't make sense.

00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:06.650
If a boy wants to go and play
dress-up they are limited

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:09.000
as to what they can
get dressed up as

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.910
without being called names
or being made fun of.

00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:15.260
They can wear a pirate costume or
be a superhero, but if they wanted

00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:21.510 position:56%
to wear princess costume or
something girly they will be thought

00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:24.030
of something less than a boy.

00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:26.800
I even thought about how sometimes
if a boy doesn't want to fight

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.990
with someone and they
want to resolve the issue

00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:31.400
with words they will
be thought of a wimp

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:32.790
because they don't want to fight.

00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:35.670
Boys are not supposed
to cry or show emotion,

00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:41.130
but they are supposed to act tough.

00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:44.380
That seems so ridiculous
because everyone has emotions

00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:48.720
and everyone should be able to feel
and show all of their emotions.

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:51.190
I also thought about how
many people like George have

00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:54.590
to live their life scared of
what people will think of them.

00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:58.730
Forced to hold in this really
big secret their whole life.

00:44:58.730 --> 00:45:01.240
I thought about how
there was a whole issue

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:05.140 position:56%
about Bruce Jenner Caitlin Jenner
having lived his whole life hiding a

00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:09.920
big secret for many decades because
of what other people would think.

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:13.860 position:56%
Even though Bruce Jenner was famous,
accomplished, rich and admired

00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:17.080 position:56%
by millions he still had to struggle
with what people would think of him

00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:21.500
for 60 years before he
let out his big secret.

00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:22.800
If that was so hard

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:25.760
for a world-famous athlete it made
me realize how much harder it would

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:30.050
be for a child like George to have
such a huge secret in middle school

00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:31.740 position:56%
that they couldn't share with anyone

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:35.380 position:56%
because even their parents may not
understand or accept their feelings.

00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:39.800
After reading this book I gave
my friends a list of words

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:43.800
and asked them to tell me if each
word described boys or girls.

00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:49.760
The words like blue, green, sports,
science, math, writing, computers,

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:55.160 position:56%
building, getting in trouble, scary,
fighting, teasing, driving fast,

00:45:55.160 --> 00:46:00.060
inventing and exploring were ones
most people said described a boy.

00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:05.140
The words Barbie, dresses, hair,
stylish, worried about appearance,

00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:10.650
quiet, giggling, using correct
grammar, getting along, clubs,

00:46:10.650 --> 00:46:14.400
driving safely, fancy
clothes, being helpful, pink,

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.900
purple and following
rules were ones most

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:20.210
of my friends chose
as describing a girl.

00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:22.820
I thought that in a way
society brainwashes us

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:24.570
as if everybody should
fit into the boy

00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:28.030
and girl boxes that they created.

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:30.900
I thought of how many people
think that they will be judged

00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:33.890
because they don't fit in
with society's expectations.

00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:38.890
Society tells us we want to
need to be normal to fit in.

00:46:38.890 --> 00:46:42.530
I thought about parents and even
my parents how some were brought

00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:44.790
up to believe these things.

00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:47.630
Most of the kids that make
fun of people who think,

00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:50.240
act or look differently are
doing what they have been taught

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:54.140
by society and by their
parents who also believe in some

00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:56.840
of society's expectations.

00:46:56.840 --> 00:47:00.280
I believe that it is time that
we change these expectations.

00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:04.830 position:56%
We know now that a person's physical
body does not determine who they are

00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:08.340
or who they like or what
they like or how they feel.

00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:14.790
Ever since I read your book I've
been more confident in myself

00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:16.440
and I've been trying to put myself

00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:19.330
in other people's shoes
before I speak.

00:47:19.330 --> 00:47:22.130
Your book helped me better
understand how people would feel

00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:24.560
when they can't be themselves.

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:26.920
I think your book helped
me become a better person,

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:30.900 position:56%
someone who will stand up for people
who are being put down and someone

00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:33.360
who will accept others
as they want to be.

00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:37.630 position:56%
I haven't found any other book that
talks about this issue of a teenager

00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:40.430
who feels like they don't belong
in the body they were born with.

00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:44.640
It made me realize that not only
should kids be reading your book,

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:46.970
but so should adults and parents

00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:49.670
because even though change
is scary no one should have

00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:51.530
to feel afraid to be themselves.

00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:56.500
Thank you Alex Gino, your book
led me to have many discussions

00:47:56.500 --> 00:48:00.130
with my librarian, my
parents and my friends.

00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:02.740
Your book and the issues
it raised helped me someone

00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:06.270
who is more supportive of people
who face serotypes like the ones

00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:11.550
in your book, about who people
are, how they should act.

00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:14.880
Your book made me realize that
maybe I can help the next George be

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:19.010
accepted throughout their life and
I can also help the next mother

00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:22.530
of George better accept their
child if they have that challenge.

00:48:22.530 --> 00:48:27.320
I want to make sure that the
next Bruce Jenner can be Caitlin

00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:31.180
from the beginning when
they first feel that way.

00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:34.550
I don't want anyone to have to live
their whole life hiding the secret

00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:37.100
of not feeling the gender
that the doctor told them

00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:39.120
that they were born with.

00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:42.950
Your book made me want to help
others accept themselves and others

00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:45.470
without prejudice or
any stereotypes.

00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:50.350
Finally, your book made me realize
how lucky I am to be comfortable

00:48:50.350 --> 00:48:55.060
with myself and feel like I belong
in my own skin and to have parents

00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:58.310
and friends who support
me just as I am.

00:48:58.310 --> 00:49:00.110
Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Here's your award
they're going to take your picture.

00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:23.380
I'm going to ask you a question
do you want to answer it?

00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:24.680
&gt;&gt; Aleema Kelly: Sure.

00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:25.980
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Well
I really get to --

00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:29.480
this is wonderful to get
to ask you a question.

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:36.650
So I wanted to be a shortstop
and was told that might not be

00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:40.680
such a good idea not
because I didn't have talent.

00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:45.200
Have you ever been told
that you can't do something?

00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:49.280
You can step up to the mic.

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:50.660
&gt;&gt; Aleema Kelly: I think one time

00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:55.020
that I have been told I couldn't
do something is I was trying

00:49:55.020 --> 00:50:00.360
to start a business of selling
sweets and baking things.

00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:08.950
And I sold stuff at a festival that
my dad like runs at Trinity College

00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:11.400
and I sold stuff for like a year.

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:15.850
And then when I told the people
at my school and I started --

00:50:15.850 --> 00:50:18.950
I asked the principal if I
could do like a bake sale

00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:25.020
at our school he said yes, but
then my teacher she didn't want me

00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:29.030
to be selling things or
doing things because she said

00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:31.600
that it wasn't appropriate for.

00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:32.900
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Oh appropriate.

00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:34.200
&gt;&gt; Aleema Kelly: Yeah.

00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:35.500
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I know that word.

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:36.800
&gt;&gt; Aleema Kelly: For kids
to be selling things.

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:40.470
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I know I've
been told that's not appropriate.

00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:42.570
I had to look it up the first time.

00:50:42.570 --> 00:50:47.910
And what are you reading now that's
what I'm really interested in too?

00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:51.910
&gt;&gt; Aleema Kelly: I am reading
a book called Empire Storms

00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:54.440
by Sarah J. Maas yeah.

00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:56.110
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: What's it about.

00:50:56.110 --> 00:50:58.840
&gt;&gt; Aleema Kelly: It is like
the 7th book in that series

00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:01.890
so I can't tell you guys too
much because it'll be a spoiler.

00:51:01.890 --> 00:51:03.590
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Yeah don't.

00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:07.770
&gt;&gt; Aleema Kelly: So it is
about a girl and she is --

00:51:07.770 --> 00:51:09.970
oh I can't tell you guys that.

00:51:09.970 --> 00:51:16.740
But she in the first book she is in
like a slave camp called Endovier

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:19.950
and they have to mine salt.

00:51:19.950 --> 00:51:26.660
And then the prince calls her in to
work for the king as an assassin.

00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:29.550
And so she has to try
to get out of that.

00:51:29.550 --> 00:51:30.850
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Yeah
I think she should.

00:51:30.850 --> 00:51:32.150
&gt;&gt; Aleema Kelly: In the first book.

00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:33.450
Yeah.

00:51:33.450 --> 00:51:34.750

announce the next one

and she said oh, you can do it.

00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:51.770
I don't think it would be fair.

but that's okay.

Hello. Dear Maya Angelou, Old
Folks Laugh how true it is.

00:52:29.490 --> 00:52:31.790
I love to watch their
cloudy eyes crinkle

00:52:31.790 --> 00:52:34.580 position:56%
at the edges and lift just a little.

00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:37.790
I like to see the spirit
come again to their face.

00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:41.950
I like to watch their drooping
cheek lift towards the skies.

00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:44.520
When old folks laugh they
free the world you wrote

00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:49.120 position:56%
in your poem Old Folks Laugh and I
couldn't lift my eyes from the page.

00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:52.750
Someone like you who can take
something that seems so big,

00:52:52.750 --> 00:52:54.940
but make it as big
in words as it feels

00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:58.730
in my heart becomes
an inspiration to me.

00:52:58.730 --> 00:53:01.700
Every Thursday I volunteer
at a seniors' home.

00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:05.190
For nearly two years I have worked
on the third floor with the people

00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:08.710
who have worsening cases of
dementia and Alzheimer's.

00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:10.830
It's hard to watch sometimes

00:53:10.830 --> 00:53:13.770
as their memory seems
to flow away like water.

00:53:13.770 --> 00:53:16.280 position:56%
Oh but how I love to see them laugh.

00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:18.820
It's as if they drank a
tall glass of their memories

00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:20.960
and everything came back.

00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:23.950
Some days it's fine and they
remember nearly everything,

00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:27.520
but other days it's do I know you.

00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:31.400
Your poem seems so selfless you
describe the elders perfectly

00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:33.350
with the right touch of play.

00:53:33.350 --> 00:53:35.190
You sound as though you
have watched carefully

00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:39.540
as their smile becomes a giggle
and then a full-fledged laugh.

00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:42.280
You have really helped
me notice the details.

00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:45.690
Last week at the seniors' home I
noticed how the seniors' pants are

00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:48.990
often a little too big
and a little too baggy.

00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:50.930
I have noticed their
yellowing teeth,

00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:53.760
their scratchy polyester
sweaters and their crooked feet

00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:56.060 position:56%
as they struggle with their walkers.

00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:59.500
I have noticed the fated interior
of their rooms and the pictures

00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:03.700
that memorialize their past
scotch-taped to their walls.

00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:06.590
Through the richness of your
descriptions I have noticed things

00:54:06.590 --> 00:54:11.300
such as how each elder
has their own laugh.

00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:15.200
Jane in her wheelchair tends to
lightly titter while Rosemary

00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:18.420
who likes to sew tends
to daintily snort.

00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:20.060
Robert likes a deep belly laugh

00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:21.820
where sometimes he
can't catch his breath

00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:23.820 position:56%
and you have to pat him on the back.

00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:27.550
You have made me realize
just how much soul they have.

00:54:27.550 --> 00:54:30.040
I like to watch as the
old folks laugh mostly

00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:33.480
because it makes me happy
watching each person be reminded

00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:35.900
of the incredible parts
of their life.

00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:38.350
I like to think I share
with you the tendency

00:54:38.350 --> 00:54:40.780
to appreciate the small
things, but then again,

00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:44.540
it isn't really a small thing
when the elderly laugh to you

00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:47.970
and I it is like a bar of gold.

00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:50.030
The old folks generously
forgive life

00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:51.960
for happening to them you wrote.

00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:56.030
Though your poem describes old
people laughing I think the content

00:54:56.030 --> 00:54:58.030
is covering a deeper meaning.

00:54:58.030 --> 00:55:00.720
It made me realize the
stories behind their smiles

00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:02.850 position:56%
and the meaning behind their laughs.

00:55:02.850 --> 00:55:04.960
Robert might like to
laugh as much as he does

00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:07.580
because once he was in the war.

00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:09.920
Through the desperation
-- the Great War.

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:12.050
Through the desperation,
death and horror he

00:55:12.050 --> 00:55:15.930 position:56%
and his friends needed a way to
find happiness among the bleak days.

00:55:15.930 --> 00:55:17.950
Jane grew up in a proper society

00:55:17.950 --> 00:55:20.660
where laughing too hard
was considered improper

00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:23.910
and so she titters rather
than actually laughing.

00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:27.020
Some days it's like my elderly
friends and I are riding on top

00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:29.340
of a wave on an oncoming laugh.

00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:31.560
Those are the best days.

00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:33.010
Since reading your poem, however,

00:55:33.010 --> 00:55:35.520
I have also noticed the
ones who don't laugh.

00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:37.910
I have quite shocked by the fact.

00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:40.990
I'll say something funny or
one or two might smile a little

00:55:40.990 --> 00:55:43.900
and one might giggle, but the
rest won't even turn up their lip.

00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:47.400
I try to convince myself that they
still feel well enough to laugh

00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:49.650
and they simply don't
find me that funny.

00:55:49.650 --> 00:55:53.040
But I know in my heart of hearts
they have forgotten how to laugh.

00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:55.670
I try to figure out a way to
teach them again for it's one

00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:58.880
of life's greatest pleasures.

00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:02.410
Because of this in many ways
reading your poem has inspired me

00:56:02.410 --> 00:56:04.220
to be a better caretaker of the old

00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:07.130
and helped me see strength
in their fragility.

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:08.570
Knowing how delicate they are

00:56:08.570 --> 00:56:11.060
and how much life they
have already lived

00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:13.740
and how many laughs they
have already laughed

00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:15.390 position:56%
and how many stories they have lived

00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:19.630
to tell makes me feel more
appreciation for them.

00:56:19.630 --> 00:56:23.210
Your poem though it describes how
the elderly laugh not only has

00:56:23.210 --> 00:56:27.830 position:56%
opened my eyes to their thoughts and
feelings, but it has also caused me

00:56:27.830 --> 00:56:29.740
to think about how they have lived

00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:32.480
and how their stories
have affected them.

00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:35.670
I'm around these incredible
people a lot and I'm very grateful

00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:38.450
to spend time with them because
I know they have lot of wisdom

00:56:38.450 --> 00:56:42.430
to teach me despite
their failing memories.

00:56:42.430 --> 00:56:44.690
Thank you for writing
Old Folks Laugh.

00:56:44.690 --> 00:56:47.330

and appreciate the stories

with the elders

00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:52.320
and the simplicities
of everyday life.

00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:55.220
Your poem relates to me so
much that it makes me smile

00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:58.020
to know I'm not the only one
to find pleasure in old folks.

Okay and as usual I'm working on it.

00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:44.220
I love to know do you
ever hear them --

00:57:44.220 --> 00:57:48.560
someone tell you a story while
you're there or working with them?

00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:51.200
&gt;&gt; Raya Kenney: Yeah they tell
lots of stories, some of them true

00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:52.510
and some of them not true.

a lot of poems about old people

00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:10.390
and I should write a story.

you might want to do that.

00:58:56.060 --> 00:58:59.130 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sarah Lurie: Dear Dorothy Parker,
the other night I sat with my family

00:58:59.130 --> 00:59:02.570 position:56%
around the dinner table
reminiscing and telling old stories.

00:59:02.570 --> 00:59:05.410
My grandma told one about the
time when mom was eight years old

00:59:05.410 --> 00:59:07.620
and wanted to play the flute.

00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:11.100
The story goes my grandma went down
to the music store to rent a flute,

00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:15.000
but the salesman told her she
needed a man to sign the contract.

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:18.180
Being a single mother she asked
her father to go to the music store

00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:22.540
and sign the papers verifying the
$2.50 bill would indeed be paid

00:59:22.540 --> 00:59:23.840
each month.

00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:27.660 position:56%
I was shocked that such a relatively
short time ago women were not

00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:31.150
trusted to make a small
simple payment.

00:59:31.150 --> 00:59:33.450
In my life there's some
pretty amazing people,

00:59:33.450 --> 00:59:36.800
but my grandma stands out as
one of the most extraordinary.

00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:39.460
When my mom and her
siblings were young --

00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:42.840
when they were young children
their dead left them leaving the

00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:45.330
protection and care in
the hands of my grandma.

00:59:45.330 --> 00:59:49.590
She managed to raised four kids,
maintain a stable job, a house

00:59:49.590 --> 00:59:51.780
and all that one needs to be happy.

00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:55.160
She was successful on her own
with no male figure by her side.

00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:58.630
Not to say there weren't
hard days, even hard years,

00:59:58.630 --> 01:00:03.650
but in the end my grandma was
still a hero and still is today.

01:00:03.650 --> 01:00:06.500
Even now at 77 years
old she is the director

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:09.420
of a Lifelong Learning
Institute for Elders.

01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:14.700 position:56%
She is such an incredible and unique
human being because of her ability

01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:18.180
to be a strong empowered
woman in the face of hardship.

01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:21.770
When I read your poem Penelope not
only did my grandma come to mind,

01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:24.220
but the potential power
of all women did.

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:27.370
This extraordinary poem has
altered my perception of the role

01:00:27.370 --> 01:00:30.650
of women figures in the
traditional male hero stories

01:00:30.650 --> 01:00:32.590
and in my own life.

01:00:32.590 --> 01:00:35.160
As I grow older, it has
become apparent that the world

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:38.000
around me struggles
with gender equality.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.670
Job opportunities, raises,
wages, access woman fight harder

01:00:42.670 --> 01:00:44.950
and longer every day
to achieve equality.

01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:48.240
That is why we need constant
clear reminders and guidance

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:50.510
to continue the shift away
from how things have been

01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:52.010
and still are today.

01:00:52.010 --> 01:00:54.970
Your poem offers such guidance.

01:00:54.970 --> 01:00:58.930
As seen in Homer's poem The
Odyssey Odysseus sets sails

01:00:58.930 --> 01:01:03.260 position:56%
on a heroic eventful journey while
Penelope tends to the baby and deals

01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:05.730
with domestic affairs in Ithica.

01:01:05.730 --> 01:01:09.280
Penelope's hope and determination
remains constant throughout his

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:12.550
absence making Penelope the
true hero much like my grandma.

01:01:12.550 --> 01:01:16.600
A key to understanding your
poem is the title itself.

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:20.970
The Odyssey is titled after
Odysseus the male hero.

01:01:20.970 --> 01:01:23.390
By titling your poem
Penelope you push the readers

01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:27.300
to question the belief
that only men are heroes.

01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:30.430
Although Odysseus led the long

01:01:30.430 --> 01:01:35.210
and eventful journey his story
could not exist without Penelope.

01:01:35.210 --> 01:01:38.750
She serves as the rock
that holds the fort down so

01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:43.100
when Odysseus returns he has the
people of Ithica to deem him hero.

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:45.330
While Penelope is an
almost invisible character

01:01:45.330 --> 01:01:48.430
in the epic story the entire
journey could not exist

01:01:48.430 --> 01:01:50.410
without her steady presence.

01:01:50.410 --> 01:01:53.000
We have a concrete image
in our minds of the roles

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.430
and obligations the male
and female figure hold,

01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:57.880
but why it takes two to tango.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:01.170
In other words, Penelope's
presence in Ithica is essential

01:02:01.170 --> 01:02:05.080
to everyday life yet is barely
acknowledged in the story.

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:08.950
I like how your poem concludes they
will call him brave emphasizing the

01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:11.970
fact that the readers are led
to view the story in the way

01:02:11.970 --> 01:02:16.270
of Odysseus' journey during
which he becomes a hero.

01:02:16.270 --> 01:02:19.290
Penelope serves as proof that
although heroic adventures seems

01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:23.500
to focus on male actions both
females and males contribute

01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:25.580
to the successful outcome.

01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:29.870
I experience gender
inequality firsthand every day.

01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:33.430
Boys get called on twice as
often as girls in the classroom

01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:37.490
and when stating the answer don't
qualify it with I think or maybe.

01:02:37.490 --> 01:02:40.520
Even something as small as
when the PE teacher yells girls

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:42.640 position:56%
against boys reflects enriched bias.

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:46.320
As I went about my sophomore
year you brought to my attention

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:49.770
that most clubs, teams and even
some classes are defined solely

01:02:49.770 --> 01:02:51.070
by gender.

01:02:51.070 --> 01:02:52.640
When I was young I
had the opportunity

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:54.020
to join a boys' soccer team

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:57.030
because there weren't enough
girls to complete our own.

01:02:57.030 --> 01:02:59.280
After reading your poem
I finally understood

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:02.410
that the coach's open-mindedness
gave me an opportunity

01:03:02.410 --> 01:03:04.820 position:56%
to prove my strength and resilience.

01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:08.100
This allowed me to
take a small first step

01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:11.830
into the women empowerment
movement alongside my grandma.

01:03:11.830 --> 01:03:15.340
Ever since I read your poem
women empowerment shows

01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:18.710
up everywhere I go, in place
I previously looked over.

01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:20.880
The examples continue
to pop in my head.

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:24.460
My middle school principal, a pilot
on the plane on a recent trip,

01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:28.210
high-profile TV role models
like Ellen DeGeneres and Oprah,

01:03:28.210 --> 01:03:31.420
the girl who joined the
wrestling team and wins matches.

01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:33.240
I could go on.

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:36.010
My point is you have
made it possible for me

01:03:36.010 --> 01:03:39.090
to acknowledge amazing
women right before my eyes.

01:03:39.090 --> 01:03:42.780 position:56%
Women who take an active role in
the movement toward gender equality.

01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:45.560
I used to not think twice about
occurrences such as these,

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:48.230
but your poem has opened my eyes

01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:51.380
and now I realize these
women are worth stopping

01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:54.140
to think about, yet
are not often seen.

01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:57.890
And now I truly appreciate
strong empowered women

01:03:57.890 --> 01:03:59.930
and want to become one myself.

01:03:59.930 --> 01:04:03.630
Since freshman year I've been on a
palms dance team at my high school.

01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:08.060
We perform for football, soccer
games, rallies, competitions,

01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:10.170
camps, and other sport events.

01:04:10.170 --> 01:04:13.220
We work extremely hard every
day to get better and stronger,

01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:16.360
yet our team continues
to be diminished.

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:19.960
We don't receive the funding
or status other teams enjoy.

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:21.800
We are constantly brushed
aside when it comes

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:24.770
to athletic programming support.

01:04:24.770 --> 01:04:28.710
As may be predictable we
are an all-girls team.

01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:31.190
Cheering for the boys'
athletic team isn't the problem,

01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:33.900
but not being treated as equals is.

01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:36.920
Maybe the funded boys'
teams see themselves

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:40.000
as cutting the glittering
waves while we brew the team,

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.740
snit the bread.

01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:45.630
Our participation is a key part
of the high school sports equation

01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:47.320
and should be supported as such.

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:51.380
We perform, train and do everything
required for the boys' team

01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:54.580
yet don't get nearly the wide
range of support they do.

01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:57.300
Reading your poem gave me insight
into my personal experience

01:04:57.300 --> 01:05:01.000
and made it clear to me that
I need to stand up for my team

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.060
and the amazing young women on it.

01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:06.950
As the new freshmen join us I
encourage them to view our team

01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:09.500
as powerful and equals
to all the others.

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:12.300
We are rising above the outdated
approach and lack of support

01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:15.230
and empowering ourselves to
fight for equality in the eyes

01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:18.270
of the school's athletic program.

01:05:18.270 --> 01:05:21.870
This is one palms team, one
school, one athletic program.

01:05:21.870 --> 01:05:23.300
We may only be a small piece

01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:25.620
to a larger puzzle,
but every piece counts.

01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:28.820
The Boulder Valley School
District alone has 56 schools.

01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:31.380
Within these 56 schools the
fight for equal treatment

01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:34.320
within the athletic
department must be a priority.

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:37.870
Female sports must be treated with
the same support as male sports

01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:41.290
in an effort to set a precedent
for the bigger picture.

01:05:41.290 --> 01:05:43.800
The one-sidedness and
lack of equality

01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:46.150
in the educational
system full of young women

01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:49.620
at such an essential time in life
is the last thing our schools need

01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:53.690
to promote and will lead to more
drastic gender inequality issues.

01:05:53.690 --> 01:05:56.480
If school districts can maintain
gender equality in something

01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:00.780
as simple as a sport it will start
a ripple effect eventually allowing

01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:04.330
the young adults within the
school to carry gender equality

01:06:04.330 --> 01:06:06.550
into everyday adult lives.

01:06:06.550 --> 01:06:10.140
Your poem has inspired me to look
more deeply into feminist ideas.

01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:13.840
Maya Angelou once said how
important it is for us to recognize

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:16.740 position:56%
and celebrate our heroes and heroes.

01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:20.770
My point is Maya Angelou, you and
now myself are taking the steps

01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:23.550
to extinguish the weak
female stereotype

01:06:23.550 --> 01:06:26.060
and instead encourage
women empowerment.

01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:29.210
We can live in a world where
all genders live as equals.

01:06:29.210 --> 01:06:32.780
You have helped me recognize that
beginning with old Greek mythology

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:35.260
to present-day gender
bias has existed.

01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:39.030
Yet there is no real reason for the
bias to exist other than the fact

01:06:39.030 --> 01:06:42.560
that society has not had the
critical mass to drive the change.

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:45.670
That is why I will continue
to work to break down the wall

01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:49.690
that allows gender stereotypes
to impact schools and sports.

01:06:49.690 --> 01:06:52.760
Thank you Dorothy Parker for
opening my eyes to the ability

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:55.900
to enlighten others to the concept
and reality of women empowerment

01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:58.380
that will shape our
world to gender equality.

01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:00.510
Sincerely, Sarah Lurie.

01:07:00.510 --> 01:07:04.130
[ Applause ]

01:07:04.130 --> 01:07:05.930
Thank you.

01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:12.600
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: [Inaudible]
to ask you something.

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:17.390
So I'm just imagining Dorothy
Parker and Maya Angelou looking

01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:20.450
down saying wow, what a duo.

01:07:20.450 --> 01:07:25.680
You mentioned that it's
inspired you to read more

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:29.300
about feminist ideas
or women's studies.

01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:33.220 position:56%
Anything kind of really interesting?

01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:35.110 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sarah Lurie: I'm trying to think.

01:07:35.110 --> 01:07:41.020
Well I know I mean I read a lot
of like Maya Angelou [inaudible].

01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:42.320
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Oh you did.

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:43.620
&gt;&gt; Sarah Lurie: Her
feminist ideas yeah.

01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:48.290
But recently at the school
we're trying to get more funding

01:07:48.290 --> 01:07:51.040
and do the things necessary
to like be treated as equals,

01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:54.460
so there's a lot of work on
that, research on that too.

01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:56.240
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And
I think that's an area

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:58.990
that we can all agree
that we'll help with.

01:07:58.990 --> 01:08:02.850
And I'm so glad you mentioned the
funding because it's really --

01:08:02.850 --> 01:08:06.780
how do you feel when you really
just say look at the differences?

01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:09.350
&gt;&gt; Sarah Lurie: Yeah, it's
just like really discouraging

01:08:09.350 --> 01:08:14.970
because as a team like we
spend hours and hours every day

01:08:14.970 --> 01:08:18.610
and like every year and it's
a year-round sport and to

01:08:18.610 --> 01:08:21.900
like not get the same amount of
respect and funding as some teams

01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:25.850 position:56%
that are even just seasonal sports I
think is just -- it's discouraging.

01:08:25.850 --> 01:08:29.970
But we have each other to support
one another and we're going to try

01:08:29.970 --> 01:08:32.650
to break out of that pattern.

01:08:32.650 --> 01:08:35.630 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And one pattern I'm
going to get out of after hearing is

01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:38.430
to not say I think so much.

01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:39.840
So thank you so much.

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:41.640
&gt;&gt; Sarah Lurie: Yes.

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:50.070

01:08:50.070 --> 01:08:51.370
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Right, right.

01:08:51.370 --> 01:08:52.950 position:56%
Yes, so I was going to invite Aleema
and Raya back up for a group photo

01:08:52.950 --> 01:08:56.290
and I'd also like to have Cathy
Gourley, our program director

01:08:56.290 --> 01:09:00.670 position:56%
for the Letters About Literature
program join us for the group photo.

01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:28.740
This has been a presentation
of the Library

01:09:28.740 --> 01:09:32.180
