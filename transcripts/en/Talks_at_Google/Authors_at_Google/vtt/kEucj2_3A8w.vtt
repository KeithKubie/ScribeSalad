00:00:05.434 --> 00:00:06.850
MARK: I'd like to
welcome you here

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.490
today for Michael Ruhlman,
who's going to be talking

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:10.750
about his book, "Grocery."

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.990
He's been a writer, a
chef, a gadget maker.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.720
My connection with him was
through a food and cooking blog

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.190
a long time ago, and came across
some of the kitchen utensils

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.340
that he helped put
together and sell.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.190
And then when I saw
his name come up

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.861
for a talk to come here,
and the topic of groceries

00:00:34.861 --> 00:00:37.360
and the psychology behind them
and the mechanics behind them

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.034
and the history, it
all seemed fascinating,

00:00:40.034 --> 00:00:41.950
because he comes at food
and cooking from sort

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.500
of oblique angles all the time.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.030
So very glad to
have him here today.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.175
And with that, Michael.

00:00:47.175 --> 00:00:48.550
MICHAEL RUHLMAN:
Thank you, Mark.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.760
Thanks to you for being here.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:01:00.490
The spoon he was talking
about is called the--

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.209
I can't-- it's such a long
title, I've forgotten it.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:06.993
MARK: It was the--

00:01:06.993 --> 00:01:09.310
MICHAEL RUHLMAN: It's
the Bad Ass Perforated--

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.120
MARK: Oh, Bad Ass.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.540
Yes.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.610
MICHAEL RUHLMAN: The Bad Ass
Perforated AKA Egg Spoon.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:13.109
MARK: Yes.

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:14.475
For making poached eggs.

00:01:14.475 --> 00:01:15.850
MICHAEL RUHLMAN:
Because I didn't

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.450
like all the flyaway stuff in
eggs when you poach an egg.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.182
And so there are many whites
that compose and different

00:01:24.182 --> 00:01:25.640
proteins are composed
in egg white.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.670
Some are thin, some
are viscous and thick.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.130
If you let the thin
ones drip through,

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.300
you're left with this
beautiful viscous white

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.320
and it makes a
beautiful poached egg.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.920
So that's the connection.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.222
But we also have offset spoons,
because a friend of mine said,

00:01:40.222 --> 00:01:41.680
Mike, I can make
anything you want.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.700
I manufacture stuff.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.550
And I had a spoon that
I'd bent for cooking.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.640
So I made some offset spoons.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.490
I made some flat
edge wooden spoons,

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.080
because I hate
round wooden spoons,

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.746
because round wooden
spoons are useless.

00:01:54.746 --> 00:01:56.890
But that's all that I
see in people's kitchens.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.230
So I try to make tools
that are not available

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.970
or things like that.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.160
But mainly what I do is I write.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.729
And I think that I've gotten
some popularity because

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.330
of my ranting and
shooting off at the mouth.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.780
I started cooking.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.200
I never meant to be here.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.980
I was a journalist, copy
boy at the "New York

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.570
Times", when I got out of Duke
University, English major.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.050
And I got a book contract
to go to the Culinary

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.460
Institute of America
to write about what

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.480
it meant to be a chef.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.145
And I realized very
quickly that you

00:02:35.145 --> 00:02:36.520
couldn't know what
it meant to be

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.670
a chef unless you became one.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.000
I was dressed like a student.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.990
I had my knife bags.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.870
I was learning how to chop
and dice and everything.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.110
And after three
weeks of basics, I--

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.710
we lived-- my then-wife and
our little baby daughter

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.370
lived 25 miles north of the
Culinary Institute of America.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.410
And a big snow storm
hit the Hudson Valley.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.910
And I couldn't make it in to
take the test-- the first test

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.580
of my career there, just
the basics, how to make

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.630
a bechamel sauce, how to chop.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.700
And I really wanted to.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.650
But I called the
chef, Mike Pardus,

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.430
37-year-old guy
from Connecticut,

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.740
but kind of a hard ass.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:15.640
I called him.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.810
And I said, Chef, I
can't make-- obviously,

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.300
the Hudson Valley is snowed
in, I can't make it in.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.542
He said, OK.

00:03:23.542 --> 00:03:25.000
I said, you don't
understand, Chef.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.197
I really want to be there.

00:03:26.197 --> 00:03:27.280
I'm taking this seriously.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.613
And I would be there if I could.

00:03:28.613 --> 00:03:30.490
But I can't.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.510
He said, OK.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.567
And I said, no, you
don't understand, Chef.

00:03:34.567 --> 00:03:35.650
I really want to be there.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:36.950
And I'd be there if I could.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.770
But I can't.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.190
He said, Michael, I'm
gonna stop you right there.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.560
He said, what we're teaching
these kids here what

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.480
it means to be a chef
is not that you know how

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.860
to concasse a tomato or dice an
onion or make a bechamel sauce.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.486
It's that when you're
a chef, you get there.

00:03:53.486 --> 00:03:56.900
I said, well, Chef, I'd
get there if I could.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.030
But I can't.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.070
He said, that's fine, Michael.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.240
You have your work.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.520
We have ours.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.880
We're chefs.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.170
We get there.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.850
We like it like that.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.280
And he hung up the phone.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.110
And my heart was thumping.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.760
And I was pacing.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.600
And I told my wife
what had happened.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.034
And she said, so basically
he's calling you a wuss.

00:04:21.034 --> 00:04:23.450
And I didn't really respond
to that, because I'm so upset.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.420
And then she looked at
me and said, oh, you

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.290
are not driving 25
miles through a blizzard

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.040
to make a bechamel sauce.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.750
I drove 25 miles
through a blizzard

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.490
to make a bechamel sauce.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.290
And that changed my life.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.150
Honestly, it changed my life.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.870
We talk about cooking
from the heart.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.620
We talk about
cooking out of love.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.650
I learned to cook out of anger.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.300
Chef Pardus had guilted me
into coming, had told me

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.840
that I couldn't do it.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.680
I was furious.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.420
I made it in.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.640
Obviously I could.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.227
I was lying to
myself, he told me.

00:04:57.227 --> 00:04:59.810
And that's one thing you learn
when you're a really good cook.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:00.893
You can't lie to yourself.

00:05:00.893 --> 00:05:01.910
I was lying to myself.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:02.920
I could make it in.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.160
And I did make it in.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.060
And from that day on.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.610
I vowed to become a cook.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.140
I wanted to become a cook.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.790
So I learned how
to become a cook.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:16.420
And I also was the
journalist that I needed

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.010
to be in order to write a book.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.790
And I finished the Culinary,
and nine months later I

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.930
was working the grill station at
the best restaurant at the CIA.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.830
And then I came home.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.666
My then-wife looked
at me and said,

00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:34.290
we're going to be
broke in four months.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.190
You got to write this
book in four months.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.590
And it took me--

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.460
you can't write a
book in four months.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.640
I had written one book before
then on an unrelated subject.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.810
And it took me eight
or nine months.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:53.280
And you can't write a
book in four months.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.010
But I didn't think
like that anymore,

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.350
because I'd gotten
there to the snowstorm.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.200
When the chef says get
there, you get there.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.750
Write a book in
four months, I'll

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.096
write a book in four months.

00:06:03.096 --> 00:06:04.720
I went to my contract,
found out that I

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.510
had to write 90,000 words
to fulfill the contract.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.040
I figured out that if I
wrote 1,400 words a day,

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:16.052
five days a week, taking
Saturday to revise, Sunday off,

00:06:16.052 --> 00:06:17.510
I would have a book
in four months.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.950
And I had a book in four months.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:22.650
And so I used those
muscles as a chef

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.830
to fulfill my
obligations as a writer.

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.039
And I really think
everybody should

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:30.830
learn to be a chef
before they do anything.

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.780
We'd have a lot fewer excuses,
and we'd operate a lot more

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.820
effectively and efficiently.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.470
That's kind of how
I got where I am.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:40.820
Suddenly I was a
journalist, but then I

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.028
had something that almost
nobody, no other journalist

00:06:43.028 --> 00:06:47.130
had, which was a foundation
in the culinary basics.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.820
And through a fluke of luck,
after I finished the book,

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:50.550
I was broke.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:51.980
I couldn't find another book.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.780
I said, I'll get
a job as a cook.

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.489
I went out to the middle
of Ohio, this restaurant.

00:06:56.489 --> 00:06:58.030
I knew this woman
was well-connected.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:03.710
She could get me a job with
the best chef in Cleveland.

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.630
I could make a paycheck
and keep writing

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.496
about something I cared about,
which is food and cooking.

00:07:08.496 --> 00:07:09.620
And she looked at my stuff.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.090
And she said, oh,
my God, I'm working

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:12.756
with Thomas Keller
at the French Laundry

00:07:12.756 --> 00:07:15.220
and we're looking for a
writer for our cookbook.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:20.420
I was like-- at the time, Thomas
Keller was a god among cooks.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.970
So I was a broke,
unemployed writer

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:26.960
who had no national
bylines or credentials

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.140
for writing about food.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.180
I walk into a restaurant
in the middle of Ohio

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.849
called Stix, because it was
so far out in the sticks.

00:07:34.849 --> 00:07:36.890
And I walk out with tickets
to the French Laundry

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:38.510
two weeks later.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:40.232
That's God sort
of saying, I know

00:07:40.232 --> 00:07:41.690
you want to be a
novelist, Michael,

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:43.273
but you're good at
writing about food.

00:07:43.273 --> 00:07:45.740
You're going to
write about food.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.380
And once I did that, once
I wrote "The French Laundry

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:53.570
Cookbook" with Thomas Keller,
I had fundamental knowledge

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.130
of the culinary fundamentals.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.380
I had a knowledge of what
those fundamentals could do,

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.660
taken to the highest
level at then

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.630
considered the best restaurant
in the country, if not

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:03.150
the world.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.030
Ruth Reichl, later that
year, would call it

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:07.580
the most exciting
restaurant in America.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:13.650
And then I realized it's
important, writing about food.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:15.950
I liked writing about food.

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:18.450
At the time, I didn't quite
realize it was important.

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:20.060
But as I continued
writing about it,

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.412
I thought other journalists
did better things,

00:08:22.412 --> 00:08:23.495
did more important things.

00:08:23.495 --> 00:08:25.119
They covered wars
and things like that.

00:08:25.119 --> 00:08:26.720
They covered politics.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.140
I was just writing about
bechamel sauce and veal stock.

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.190
Is that really important?

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:34.990
But as I kept writing and
as the country kept growing,

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:37.370
and I realized that
we were becoming

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:41.450
so obsessed with our food.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:42.440
What does it mean?

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.779
What is it doing to us?

00:08:43.779 --> 00:08:45.320
We're turning chefs
into celebrities.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.610
What's going on here?

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:48.830
Food is important.

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:50.900
And I had sort of
lost track of that.

00:08:54.215 --> 00:08:56.090
It was obvious to me
that food was important,

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:57.950
but I didn't quite
realize it until I

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:00.514
saw all the problems that were
happening because of our food

00:09:00.514 --> 00:09:02.930
system and what we're doing
and that we'd stopped cooking.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:11.445
Our healthcare system, it's a
billion-dollar-a-day problem

00:09:11.445 --> 00:09:13.910
of diet-related diseases.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:17.450
People have crazy allergies.

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:19.890
You have recent health problems.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:23.057
These are not-- when
I was growing up,

00:09:23.057 --> 00:09:24.890
I didn't know anybody
with a peanut allergy.

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:26.848
I didn't know anybody
who was allergic to eggs.

00:09:26.848 --> 00:09:27.770
Now there are kids--

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:29.645
So something is happening
to our food system.

00:09:29.645 --> 00:09:32.000
And I realized that
this was important

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.720
and we need to consciously
acknowledge food is important.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.666
Food is really important.

00:09:37.666 --> 00:09:39.290
I think we've become
obsessed with food

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:41.900
because when something
you need to survive

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:46.130
starts making you sick, you
become very obsessive about it.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:51.470
And it all sort of
crystallized for me,

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:54.080
and this book sort
of began when I

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.250
was standing in a grocery store
with dinner, some hamburger

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:02.090
buns and a bottle of wine and
some Lay's chips, I believe,

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:05.070
and some Greek yogurt,
and I was standing

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:09.770
behind a lady who was sort of
fortyish, dressed for business,

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:12.890
probably coming home from work,
grabbing some stuff for dinner

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:14.030
and the home.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.280
And she put a carton of
fat-free half-and-half

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.690
on the conveyor belt.
And I looked at it.

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:25.970
I often wondered who buys
fat-free half-and-half?

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:30.251
Half-and-half is defined
by the amount of fat in it.

00:10:30.251 --> 00:10:31.500
And so I couldn't help myself.

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:35.060
I asked this seemingly
intelligent woman,

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:37.280
excuse me, ma'am,
can I ask why you're

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.411
buying fat-free half-and-half?

00:10:39.411 --> 00:10:40.910
And she looked at
me kind of puzzled

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:45.070
and said, because it's fat-free?

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:48.660
And I said, what do you think
they replace the fat with?

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:53.400
She'd never really
thought about it.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.140
She'd picked it up
right there and read,

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.780
skim milk, corn syrup.

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:00.630
She looked at me, frowned, put
it back on the conveyor belt

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:04.140
and bought the fat-free
half-and-half anyway.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.210
That moment sort of
crystallized a lot of things

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:09.960
for me, that we don't
think about our food,

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:13.520
that we allow other people
to do our thinking for us,

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.680
that we think fat is bad
is one example of that.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.710
We're taught that fat is bad.

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:20.610
Fat is not bad.

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:21.600
Too much fat is bad.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.810
Too much of anything is bad.

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:24.060
Lettuce.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:27.330
I'm here to tell you,
lettuce is dangerous.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.580
Lettuce can be hazardous
to your health.

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.500
If you only eat lettuce, you
will become malnourished,

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:37.210
you will become sick, and
women will become infertile.

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:41.910
So be very careful when
you're at that salad bar.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.800
Same thing is true with fat.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.961
If you eat too much fat,
if all you ate was fat,

00:11:45.961 --> 00:11:46.710
that would be bad.

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:50.950
We need fat to dissolve
various vitamins.

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:51.660
It's good for us.

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:52.560
And it tastes good.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.290
I'm just fond of saying, fat
isn't bad, stupid is bad.

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:04.470
We need to think more
clearly about food.

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:09.180
For this grocery book, I went
shopping with my physician.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:14.250
And she picked up some
kale and she said,

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:18.580
it drives me crazy,
people call this healthy.

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.240
Kale isn't healthy, she said.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.110
I said, it's not?

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:25.130
She says, no, kale's nutritious.

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:26.190
We are healthy.

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:27.690
Our food isn't healthy.

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:30.240
Our food is nutritious
or it's not nutritious.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.730
We are healthy if we
eat nutritious food.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:34.950
It begins with words.

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:36.450
Our understanding
begins with words.

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:38.949
We're not going to be able to
make good decisions about what

00:12:38.949 --> 00:12:41.160
we buy, what we
feed our families,

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:46.077
what we cook, unless we
think clearly about food.

00:12:46.077 --> 00:12:47.910
The second thing I think
people need to know

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:50.610
is, nobody really
knows anything.

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:55.770
All these studies drive
me absolutely bananas.

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:57.180
The fact that in
the '70s we were

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.390
told not to eat eggs,
because they were bad for us.

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:02.940
Cholesterol in the
yolks, obviously they're

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:07.920
going to make our blood
serum cholesterol go up.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:11.040
We were told for
more than a decade

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:17.220
that the egg, this miracle
of economy, nutrition,

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:21.420
deliciousness, and functionality
in the kitchen, was bad for us.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:26.010
Food for humans for
millennia, bad for us.

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:27.390
Not true.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:30.570
Further investigation, what
the actual studies now show

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:32.760
is that if you have
low cholesterol,

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.390
eggs actually will
raise your cholesterol.

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:38.370
If you have high
cholesterol, eggs

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:39.810
don't affect your cholesterol.

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:41.435
That seems to be what
the studies show.

00:13:41.435 --> 00:13:43.800
So the eggs are helping
you find the right balance

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.025
for your cholesterol.

00:13:46.025 --> 00:13:48.150
Again, people say, well,
how do I know what to eat?

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.733
What do I eat?

00:13:48.733 --> 00:13:50.790
What I tell all
people how to eat

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:54.326
is, don't pay attention
to how something tastes

00:13:54.326 --> 00:13:55.950
or how you feel while
you're eating it.

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:57.930
Pay attention to how you
feel after you eat it.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.760
I love Pringles potato chips,
one of the most heavily

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.460
processed foods on the planet.

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:09.290
It's delicate, crispy,
tastes vaguely like potato.

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:10.657
Salty.

00:14:10.657 --> 00:14:11.490
I love those things.

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:17.130
But if I eat a whole tube
of them, I feel shitty.

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:20.880
But if I eat a buttered steak
with a nice crust of salt

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.490
on it, a baked potato with
a slab of butter on it,

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:25.310
and some green
beans, I eat that,

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:27.540
and I feel good afterwards.

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.682
That's my body saying,
yeah, that's nutritious.

00:14:29.682 --> 00:14:31.140
And here's the
thing with the word.

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:33.473
Now, you look at that plate,
and you see all the butter,

00:14:33.473 --> 00:14:35.010
and you see salt and stuff.

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:39.070
And if I were to ask
somebody, is this healthy?

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:41.330
Is this plate of food healthy?

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:42.410
It's harder to answer.

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:45.754
But if you say, is
this food nutritious?

00:14:45.754 --> 00:14:48.170
That's much easier to say,
yeah, you've got a good protein

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:49.700
there-- sorry for
the vegans here--

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.300
you've got a good fat--

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.580
dairy fat, sorry.

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.070
Vegan is hard.

00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:01.070
I don't know about how
I would live as a vegan.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:03.890
Not that I am against
it for any reason.

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:07.130
I respect your
reason to be a vegan.

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:08.420
It's just hard.

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.110
It's hard and unpleasant.

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:14.930
And there's so much pleasure
to be had in cheese and butter

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:15.946
and things like that.

00:15:15.946 --> 00:15:17.570
I think it's easier
to think about food

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:22.740
if we think of it in proper
terms with the proper words.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.970
And so this is just what I do.

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:26.960
I write about food.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.070
I write about these issues.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:31.250
And I try to make
sense of things.

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:34.361
And my father loved
grocery stores.

00:15:34.361 --> 00:15:36.610
He would go to five different
grocery stores in a day.

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:37.109
Loved them.

00:15:37.109 --> 00:15:38.570
They were sort of bounty itself.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.400
You could get so much cool food.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:44.960
But for him, it was like frozen
appetizers in the frozen food

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.520
store.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.950
But he loved grocery stores.

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:49.580
He loved going.

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:51.514
He loved looking at
other people's baskets.

00:15:51.514 --> 00:15:52.430
Wonder what they have.

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:54.301
They've got something
better than I have.

00:15:54.301 --> 00:15:56.300
And he once said to me,
you know, when I retire,

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.820
I think I might bag groceries.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:02.730
When he died in 2008, I was
bereft and upset and depressed.

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:05.570
And I think that's part of
why I went a few months later

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:09.080
to a small grocery
store in Cleveland, Ohio

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:16.070
to look into where we
buy most of our food.

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:20.540
Grocery stores were
interesting to me.

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.835
They're a retail store that
we use like no other store.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:30.260
It's the only store most of
us have to go to once or twice

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.840
a week.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.100
They are a symbol.

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:35.870
And during the
Cold War, they were

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:39.230
a symbol of American
capitalism and prosperity.

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:40.670
They're a mirror of our culture.

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:42.380
They show what we're
afraid of, what

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:45.650
we're curious about, what we
don't know, what we crave,

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:47.179
shows you how big we are.

00:16:47.179 --> 00:16:49.220
This one store I went--
so I went up to Heinen's.

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:51.139
It's sort of like a Wegmans.

00:16:51.139 --> 00:16:51.680
I don't know.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.899
What's a good quality
grocery store here?

00:16:54.899 --> 00:16:56.690
I don't know them up
in San Francisco area.

00:16:56.690 --> 00:17:00.890
MARK: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:03.440
MICHAEL RUHLMAN: Anyway, this
is sort of a high end grocery

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:03.939
store.

00:17:03.939 --> 00:17:05.510
They had about 20 stores.

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:08.569
And during that first
meeting with the brothers,

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:11.510
I learned that this one
store did $600 million

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:14.359
in sales yearly.

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:18.230
This was more than a half
a billion dollars a year

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:19.310
in sales.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:22.250
And yet, they only made a $6
million profit every year.

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:28.550
A 1% profit, which is a really
scary margin to work on.

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:30.470
And yet they're
responsible for our food.

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:31.969
One of the things
I want to know is,

00:17:31.969 --> 00:17:36.459
how can I get pea pods 365
days a year, as much as I want?

00:17:36.459 --> 00:17:38.000
And not just in the
Heinen's stores--

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.440
any of their 20 stores--

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.890
but in the 100 stores around
Cleveland, and at the 38,000

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:45.560
grocery stores in America.

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.880
Where was all this
food coming from?

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.700
Where did it come from?

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:52.130
And that's why I wanted to
look into grocery stores.

00:17:52.130 --> 00:18:00.320
And I realized ultimately how
much I loved grocery stores.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:05.570
Most people think of them as
chores or sort of a headache

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:09.980
or someplace you have to go
to endure-- get in, get out.

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:13.940
I began to see grocery stores
as a remarkable institution

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:19.280
in America, a place where
we get all kinds of food--

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:23.540
both nourishing and crummy
food, but that's up to us--

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:28.372
all kinds of food for
relatively inexpensive--

00:18:28.372 --> 00:18:30.530
at an inexpensive cost.

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:32.570
It's extraordinary that
we have so much food.

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:35.827
And I think that we need
to appreciate the food.

00:18:35.827 --> 00:18:36.660
So that's all I did.

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.360
I hung out at grocery stores.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:39.447
I bagged groceries.

00:18:39.447 --> 00:18:41.780
And it was amazing to watch
the river of food come down,

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:46.170
just an endless river of
food, an extraordinary volume

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:47.000
of food.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.360
This one store, for instance,
brings in every year

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:56.960
32,000 pounds of carrots, week
after week, year after year.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:04.100
And what's, I think, even
more astonishing than that,

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:10.650
if you extrapolate that 20
stores does about 30,000 pounds

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:11.580
of carrots a week.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:17.229
Multiply that by 32,000
or 38,000 stores.

00:19:17.229 --> 00:19:19.020
That's a lot of carrots
that we go through.

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:21.330
And they're all mainly grown
in one place, Bakersfield,

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:23.120
California.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.230
About 90%, 95% of
our carrots come

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:29.019
from Bakersfield, California
and in fields so vast

00:19:29.019 --> 00:19:30.060
they have to fly to them.

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:32.670
That's how much room it takes.

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:35.160
So all these issues
just came into focus

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.880
when I started looking
into the grocery store.

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:45.960
And I think it's important,
because cooking--

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:50.130
it's ultimately important
because cooking is important.

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:53.640
I'm going to talk for five
more minutes about why

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.990
cooking is important and
related to the grocery store.

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:58.710
And then I hope to have some
sort of dialogue about what

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:00.450
matters to you about food.

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:04.560
But for me, cooking is more
important than we realize.

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.760
There's a great book
called "Catching Fire:

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.190
How Cooking Made us Human."

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:12.610
Do any of you know that book?

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:14.100
It's by-- do you know it?

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.320
Have you heard of it?

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:21.330
It's by Richard Wrangham,
a primatologist at Harvard.

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:23.430
And he argues
persuasively in this book

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:29.340
that it wasn't the
taming of fire that

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:31.170
made us triumph as a species.

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:33.090
It wasn't a genetic
fluke that tripped us

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:36.420
over from our hominid
ancestors to Homo sapiens.

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:39.030
It was the cooking of food.

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:42.660
At the time, there
about 12 upright

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:48.142
different species, different
versions of this animal

00:20:48.142 --> 00:20:48.975
that we have become.

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:55.890
We began cooking
food, at some point.

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:57.600
And it changed us.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.700
Once we cooked food--
before we cooked food,

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:05.430
we had to sit in one place
by ourselves masticating

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:07.680
pounds and pounds
of raw vegetation

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.050
in order to get enough
calories to support

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:14.100
this big body of ours and this
calorie-hungry brain of ours,

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:19.440
which uses about 30% of our
calories that we take in.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.690
Once we started
cooking food, we could

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:23.940
consume extraordinary
amounts of calories

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:27.240
very quickly and
very efficiently.

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.340
This made us very healthy.

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:31.470
It allowed us to
spread our genes.

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:33.336
It changed our anatomy.

00:21:33.336 --> 00:21:34.710
Our gut shrank,
because we didn't

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:38.550
need to fill it up with
massive amounts of vegetation.

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:41.400
Because we weren't shoving
pounds of vegetation down

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.340
our throats, it
conceivably allowed

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:49.230
us to develop a more delicate,
refined vocal anatomy that

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:52.780
allowed for nuanced language
instead of sign language,

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:55.689
which we likely were
using at the time.

00:21:55.689 --> 00:21:57.480
And it did something
else really important.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.810
In order to take advantage
of the genetic advantages,

00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:05.910
the health advantages of cooked
food, we had to work together.

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:07.470
Cooking takes work.

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:08.610
We had to work together.

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:11.250
Someone had to stay at
home and cook the tubers

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:16.140
while the men went out and
looked for the high protein

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:19.320
items, which were hard to get
and often were hard to come by.

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:25.124
We would then share.

00:22:25.124 --> 00:22:26.040
We shared in the work.

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.212
We shared in the eating.

00:22:28.212 --> 00:22:29.670
You couldn't be an
asshole anymore,

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:30.780
because you wouldn't
get any food.

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.280
You'd be ostracized
from the group.

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.740
So we learned to cooperate.

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:37.470
And arguably, sitting
around eating this food,

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:41.550
we learned to talk together
and to work together.

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:43.740
And this allowed
us to cooperate,

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:47.940
and arguably allowed us to
protect ourselves, strategize,

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:51.420
and ultimately become the
most successful species

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:55.590
on the planet
because of cooking.

00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:58.890
Move forward to the
1950s and 1960s,

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:02.220
when we largely stopped
cooking our own food.

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:06.350
And that is precisely when
our health concerns begin.

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:12.000
It's when social alienation
begins to be documented.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.460
And it's the beginning of
all our health problems.

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:20.970
So when I question whether
the veracity of that

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:23.550
claim that cooking
made us human,

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:25.290
I look at what happens
when we don't cook

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:27.840
and I look at all the
problems that there are today.

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.942
And that's why I think
that cooking is important.

00:23:29.942 --> 00:23:31.650
That's why I think
it's important to know

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:33.810
what's in your grocery store.

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:36.069
And that's why I
will write that, as I

00:23:36.069 --> 00:23:37.860
did in "The Washington
Post," which I think

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:42.000
will come out tomorrow,
that things like breakfast

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.830
is the most dangerous
meal of the day,

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:46.920
because 90% of our
households rely on cereal,

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:48.624
which is basically sugar.

00:23:48.624 --> 00:23:49.790
And it's not just the sugar.

00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:50.970
It's the refined
wheat that it's made

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:53.011
from that becomes sugar
pretty much as soon as it

00:23:53.011 --> 00:23:54.750
enters your bloodstream.

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:56.820
We need to think
about these things,

00:23:56.820 --> 00:24:01.320
because if we're not
healthy, we're not happy.

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:04.300
And if we're not healthy, we
don't have healthy families.

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:06.120
So ultimately, a
book about groceries

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:12.300
is a book about the importance
of cooking and my conviction

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:16.050
that when we cook our
own food, our bodies

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:18.760
are healthier, our
families are healthier,

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:21.210
our communities are healthier,
and our environment is

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:26.020
healthier, all of which are
fundamental to our happiness.

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:28.470
And so that's why I wrote
"Grocery," basically,

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:31.590
to look into where
our food comes from.

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:33.900
And thanks for
listening to me spiel.

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:36.330
I'd rather have a conversation
and talk about things

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:40.494
that matter to you guys
and answer questions

00:24:40.494 --> 00:24:41.910
as to why you're
here and what you

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:45.780
care about regarding our
food system or just the food

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:47.220
that we eat.

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:49.770
Because the center
of the grocery

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:53.160
store is nutritionally
bankrupt, by and large.

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:55.800
The periphery, we
know, is good for us.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:59.040
All the stuff that goes
bad is good for us.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.050
The way they make
food shelf-stable

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:03.270
so it can sit on
the middle shelves

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:05.970
is to take out all
the nutrition in it.

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:07.440
The nutrition is what goes bad.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:10.760
So if your food doesn't
go bad, you probably

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.270
should think twice
about eating it.

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:14.190
Those Pringles that
I love so much?

00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:16.980
They'll be good for two,
three, four, five years.

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:19.620
That's not good.

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:21.987
So are there any questions,
any topic somebody

00:25:21.987 --> 00:25:22.820
wants to talk about?

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:23.334
Yes.

00:25:23.334 --> 00:25:25.500
AUDIENCE: I want to know
more about your involvement

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.060
with the group of
investors who are

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:31.740
trying to take over Whole
Foods, or influence it somehow.

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:35.180
MICHAEL RUHLMAN: Well, I have
nothing to do with Whole Foods

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:36.180
personally.

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:39.810
So nothing between
me and Whole Foods.

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:42.390
Whole Foods is a really
interesting story right now.

00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:44.372
Whole Foods really changed--

00:25:44.372 --> 00:25:46.830
if there was one person who
really changed our food system,

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:51.720
it's probably John Mackey, who
is the founder of Whole Foods.

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.700
He, more than anybody
else, convinced farmers

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:56.370
that they could make a living
by growing organic food.

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:57.840
Most of the grocers
I talked with

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:01.530
say supermarkets didn't not
want to carry organic food,

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:03.804
because people wanted it,
they started wanting it.

00:26:03.804 --> 00:26:05.220
We couldn't get
enough of it, they

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:07.920
said, until Whole
Foods came along.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.080
They went national in 1988.

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:14.520
And that's really when
organic became viable.

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:19.320
They convinced enough cattle
growers and meat packers

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:25.980
to grow their beef without
hormones and antibiotics.

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:29.800
This made it possible for
normal grocery stores that

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:33.000
didn't have the buying
leverage that Whole Foods had

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.460
to buy hormone-free beef,
beef that's better for us.

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:43.332
And that leads to
their problem now.

00:26:43.332 --> 00:26:44.790
They were so good
at what they did,

00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:46.539
they created so
much of this food,

00:26:46.539 --> 00:26:48.330
that it's now available
to all the grocers.

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:52.110
So all the grocers have
just what Whole Foods has.

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:54.360
And now the only thing that
distinguishes Whole Foods

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:57.229
from a grocery store
is higher prices.

00:26:57.229 --> 00:26:58.770
And so that's why
they're in trouble.

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:02.190
And that's why they're
creating this 365 chain, which

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:04.740
is basically just a
grocery store now.

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:07.590
So that's what's happening
with Whole Foods.

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:09.624
And I don't know what's
going to happen to them.

00:27:09.624 --> 00:27:11.790
They want a big investor
because they're in trouble.

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:18.780
The downside is that we could
see the demise of Whole Foods.

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:21.910
The upside is we can
get that same stuff

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:24.760
at our local
supermarket these days.

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:26.974
So that's what's up
between me and Whole Foods.

00:27:26.974 --> 00:27:27.640
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:29.770
I read something more
specific, that you

00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:32.320
were involved with a
specific group of investors

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:35.397
who are trying to get
on the board and--

00:27:35.397 --> 00:27:36.230
MICHAEL RUHLMAN: No.

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.460
AUDIENCE: No?

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:36.910
OK.

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:37.183
MICHAEL RUHLMAN: No.

00:27:37.183 --> 00:27:39.010
I'm a writer and
journalist and I am not

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:40.490
associated with any investors.

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:41.031
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:27:41.031 --> 00:27:42.430
Thanks.

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:45.130
AUDIENCE: As I mentioned, I had
some health issues recently.

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:48.130
And I did a lot of research
about what I should and should

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:49.510
not eat.

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:52.540
And I came to the
conclusion that I

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:56.410
should stop eating refined
sugar and refined wheat.

00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:58.860
And you briefly mentioned that.

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:02.410
But I love bread.

00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:05.170
And I did a lot of
research and found out

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:07.830
sourdough is OK to eat.

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:11.200
Do you have some insight
to share on that topic?

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.700
MICHAEL RUHLMAN: Yeah.

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:14.440
I wouldn't listen
to anybody when

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:18.130
they make nutrition claims,
because nobody knows what

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:19.600
the fuck they're talking about.

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:20.650
Bottom line.

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:22.930
There haven't been the double
blind long-term studies

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:27.010
necessary for any definitive
conclusions about what's

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:28.310
good for us, what's bad for us.

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:30.550
There are some certain
common sense things.

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:32.350
And there is more
and more evidence--

00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:36.210
and this does make common
sense, and it's my personal bias

00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:37.900
and my opinion only--

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:41.170
that it is sugar and
refined grains that

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:44.060
are causing the
majority of problems,

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:46.300
largely related to
the insulin release

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:50.304
that happens when either these
refined grains or sugar come

00:28:50.304 --> 00:28:51.220
into your bloodstream.

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:54.850
You get too much sugar, it
triggers an insulin response.

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:58.351
There's not enough insulin
to deliver this energy

00:28:58.351 --> 00:28:59.350
to where it ought to go.

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:01.000
And so it's stored
as fat and creates

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.990
all kinds of other problems.

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:05.730
So yeah, I would agree.

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:08.800
And the nutritionist doctor
that I spoke with always

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:12.160
advise her clients, stay
away from stripped carbs.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:16.210
Here's another-- I was
talking about words.

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:17.970
She says they're stripped carbs.

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:20.500
We talk about refined wheat?

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:22.480
Refined has good connotations.

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:23.350
It's pure.

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:25.840
It's refined.

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:27.160
It's not refined.

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.951
It's stripped of its nutrients.

00:29:28.951 --> 00:29:29.700
That's what it is.

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:31.780
So she wants us to think
of not refined wheat,

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:35.550
but stripped wheat,
stripped of its nutrients.

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:36.610
Fortified.

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:37.790
We have to fortify--

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:38.890
fortify is good.

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:41.702
Well, we have to fortify
stuff because we took

00:29:41.702 --> 00:29:42.910
all the good stuff out of it.

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:47.200
So we got to try and
put it back in there.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:51.220
I think your suspicions are
right about refined wheat

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:56.200
and grain, especially
in the morning,

00:29:56.200 --> 00:30:00.220
ironically, when there's
no fat, there's no fiber,

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:05.830
there's no protein that slows
the absorption by your blood.

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:09.350
So I don't want
to give up pasta.

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:10.780
I love bread, too.

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:14.910
What I think you need to do
is not be afraid of bread,

00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:16.140
but eat good bread.

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:18.100
Eat good sourdough.

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:21.040
Eat foods that still
have a fiber matrix.

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.660
Corn flakes don't
have any fiber.

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:24.630
All the fiber has been
taken out of them.

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:26.380
That's the stuff that
slows its absorption

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:27.296
into your bloodstream.

00:30:27.296 --> 00:30:30.310
So have bread, but have some
protein with it, as well.

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:32.620
Have some fat with it, as well.

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:34.630
Don't just eat pure bread.

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:38.050
I wouldn't just have a bowl
of pasta with some oil on it.

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:39.700
I'd have other things, too.

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:43.000
So minimize that sugar.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.550
Try to eat as little as
possible before noon.

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:47.350
This is what that
doctor recommended.

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:48.700
Seems to make sense.

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:51.670
By then, you're
ingesting other stuff

00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:54.310
to slow the absorption of
the refined wheats and sugars

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:55.000
that we eat.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.820
But I would agree, yeah,
stay away from sugar

00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:00.730
and stay away from
refined grains.

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:01.610
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:01.840
MICHAEL RUHLMAN: Hi.

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:02.420
AUDIENCE: I haven't
read the book.

00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:03.519
I'm excited to do so.

00:31:03.519 --> 00:31:05.060
MICHAEL RUHLMAN:
It's just out today.

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:07.940
So there's no way you
could have really read it.

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:09.980
AUDIENCE: It's 3:00.

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:10.635
It's Google.

00:31:10.635 --> 00:31:10.920
MICHAEL RUHLMAN: That's true.

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:11.860
You've had plenty of time.

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:13.693
AUDIENCE: But I'm
wondering, do you touch on

00:31:13.693 --> 00:31:17.860
in the book anything about
food distribution systems

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:22.930
and issues with monoculture and
diversity of product in stores,

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:26.200
and food miles and all
those sorts of issues?

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.700
MICHAEL RUHLMAN: I
don't get heavily

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:32.790
into that, because I've found
that stuff, while important,

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:35.680
it's really boring.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:39.490
And it's hard to write
an interesting narrative

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:41.740
about that.

00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:45.370
It is important.

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:49.230
Tho other part of that equation
is it's incredibly complex.

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:51.550
The issues of monocultures
is a serious one.

00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:54.520
If we rely on
monocultures, we are

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:56.650
jeopardizing our food system.

00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:57.970
And we can't.

00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:01.540
If we allow Roundup and
Monsanto, these companies

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:06.670
to develop products for
us, we're in danger.

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:09.070
Is it a good thing that
we now can get blueberries

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:13.240
from Uruguay in the winter when
we never used to be able to?

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:17.050
Well, it's good for
those farmers in Uruguay.

00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:19.300
Is it bad for the food miles?

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:21.434
Cargill will tell you one
thing and farmers here

00:32:21.434 --> 00:32:22.350
will tell you another.

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:24.000
And both have their points.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.430
It's a very complicated system.

00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:28.390
And it was outside the
purview of the book.

00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:30.250
I talk about what I
don't write in the book,

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:31.500
because I felt so overwhelmed.

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:33.900
This whole grocery store
represented our entire food

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:34.600
system.

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.970
And it was so complex
and so baffling

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:39.420
that I had to pick and
choose where I went.

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:40.980
But those issues are important.

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:43.410
We're dealing with
them every day.

00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:47.850
And I don't have
the answers to is it

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:50.170
a good thing that we
can get blueberries

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:54.180
from Uruguay or strawberries
from Chile in January.

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:57.750
My son says that it's
probably a bad thing.

00:32:57.750 --> 00:33:00.720
But we set up a system, we set
up expectations here in America

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:03.330
that we can get anything
we want whenever we want.

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:07.529
And until we stop demanding
fruit that's out of season,

00:33:07.529 --> 00:33:08.820
we're going to keep getting it.

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:10.650
Because that's one thing
I do know that when

00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:12.420
you buy something at a store,
or if you take something

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:14.520
off the shelf, you are
asking for more of it.

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:15.820
It will be replaced.

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:17.700
That's their job.

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.702
So when you buy a
can of Pringles,

00:33:19.702 --> 00:33:20.910
they're going to put it back.

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:23.760
If no one bought Pringles
anymore, they'd disappear.

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:27.240
We've seen our grocery
stores go from selling--

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.630
the only herb I knew when I
was growing up was parsley.

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:31.410
Now we have a whole
range of herbs.

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:34.041
We have all kinds of
fruits and vegetables,

00:33:34.041 --> 00:33:35.040
just because we want it.

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:39.030
We've created really good
food in our grocery stores

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:41.160
just by demanding it.

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:45.180
So I guess the only thing that
I would say to you is if you

00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:51.270
believe in multi-cultures--
not monocultures--

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:58.350
buy those foods that encourage
the creation of a diverse crop.

00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:01.904
Don't buy monocultural products
and they won't come back.

00:34:01.904 --> 00:34:03.570
AUDIENCE: So one thing
that I've noticed

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:06.630
is that you can get a
diversity of product

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:10.139
in cities, in places
where people are demanding

00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:11.699
the diversity of product.

00:34:11.699 --> 00:34:16.860
But then it is probably
flown in from all sorts

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:20.190
of different places where
they grow that diversity.

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:23.130
But if you actually
go out closer

00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:26.820
to where food is grown in
this country, or the middle

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:29.370
of America or just
outside of cities,

00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:34.290
that the diversity of product
is much lower because of the way

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:36.630
that the distribution
system is set up.

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:43.154
And if anything, it seems
odd that the food probably

00:34:43.154 --> 00:34:45.570
didn't travel from down the
road, where it might have been

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:47.735
grown, but from
some other place,

00:34:47.735 --> 00:34:51.461
like you're saying, like the
blueberries from Uruguay.

00:34:51.461 --> 00:34:51.960
Anyway.

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.300
Look forward to
reading the book.

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:54.425
MICHAEL RUHLMAN: Thank you.

00:34:54.425 --> 00:34:56.870
It's a tough problem.

00:34:56.870 --> 00:34:59.790
And I'd be grumpy if I
couldn't have coffee,

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:03.060
because I don't live in
an area that grows coffee,

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.470
or get olive oil.

00:35:08.755 --> 00:35:12.180
It's a big world, and we
have a lot of opportunity.

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:14.945
And we never even thought
about these before.

00:35:14.945 --> 00:35:16.320
But these are
issues that we need

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:17.670
to think more and more about.

00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:20.154
And there are no good
answers right now.

00:35:20.154 --> 00:35:21.570
AUDIENCE: What
does it really mean

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:23.050
when we say a food is organic?

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:25.320
Is there a
certification process?

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:28.550
When I see a food in the
store and it says "organic",

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:30.130
what does it actually mean?

00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:31.980
MICHAEL RUHLMAN: It
means it is certified

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:33.990
by the government as organic.

00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:39.540
Any farmer that wants to
call his or her food organic

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:41.700
is certified by the government.

00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:44.280
And it costs a lot of
money to get it certified.

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.630
So it is certified.

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:48.060
There's various rules
that they're looked at.

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:50.190
There are no pesticides
and all that.

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:51.990
And so it is organic.

00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:55.170
Has organic then been
co-opted by big business?

00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:57.360
In many ways, it has.

00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.000
Is organic even better?

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.160
We don't know, but we
suspect that it is.

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.950
All the pesticides, especially--

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:08.065
there's a number of pesticides,
but one I look at is

00:36:08.065 --> 00:36:12.360
glyphosate, which is in
the chemical Roundup--

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:16.350
that seems to actually--

00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:19.950
doesn't affect our
health, per se, but it

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:22.650
really screws with our gut
bacteria, which we really need.

00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:24.420
We have more bacteria
in our systems

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:26.040
than we have actual cells.

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.840
That's how much
bacteria we have.

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:31.890
And so I think that organic
food is a better choice,

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:37.110
regardless of it's big
business organic or not.

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:41.280
And remember that just because
something isn't called organic,

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:43.170
it may be just as
good as organic,

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:45.570
because that farmer is small
and doesn't want to pay

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:47.820
for an expensive certification.

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:49.020
And that's too bad.

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:52.170
We need to recognize
what's meaningful

00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:56.370
organic, what's not
meaningful organic, what's

00:36:56.370 --> 00:37:00.000
almost organic, or just as
good as organic, as well.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.380
But to answer your
question, it's

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:05.970
certified by the government
as being pesticide-free.

00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:10.740
And there's a whole
range of qualifications.

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:13.920
But it is all organic.

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:17.315
Often, you can get organic
stuff in the normal produce.

00:37:17.315 --> 00:37:19.440
If they run out of something
in your grocery store,

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:22.350
they'll just put the organic
and not even label it organic.

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:25.020
But anything labeled organic
must be organic and certified

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:26.250
as such.

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:28.290
AUDIENCE: So unquestionably,
one of the reasons

00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:30.510
that people are pushing
more towards processed foods

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:33.190
and more towards these really
quick, ready-to-eat foods

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:34.920
is that they're fast.

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.060
It's instantly available.

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:37.740
I grab it off the shelf.

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:41.940
Like you said, it can
last forever, seemingly.

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:48.660
So how do we make better
foods more convenient?

00:37:51.095 --> 00:37:52.470
MICHAEL RUHLMAN:
I don't think we

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:54.671
can make them any more
convenient than we already

00:37:54.671 --> 00:37:55.170
have.

00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:56.920
They're pretty convenient.

00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:00.210
I mean, is three minutes in the
microwave not convenient enough

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:01.140
for you?

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:04.810
I mean, it used to be 30
minutes of a frozen pot

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:05.580
pie in the oven.

00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:06.660
And that became too long.

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:08.730
Then nine minutes in the
microwave was too long.

00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:11.220
So they said,
let's get it lower.

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:16.180
I think the problem is
in the way we think.

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:18.210
The problem's with us.

00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:22.560
Yeah, we want convenience
and we want cheap.

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:25.350
One of the food researchers,
food marketing researcher

00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:27.900
I talked with, said,
our food is never

00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:33.317
going to change because we
are cheap and we are lazy.

00:38:33.317 --> 00:38:34.900
And we're always
going to be that way.

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:38.219
So any food that saves us
time or saves us money,

00:38:38.219 --> 00:38:39.510
it's going to keep coming back.

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:40.500
That's going to be your fad.

00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:42.369
In fact, it's not even
if it saves us money.

00:38:42.369 --> 00:38:43.910
Because I can always
make more money.

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:45.480
I can't make more time.

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.460
So it's got to save me time.

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:49.380
This is the wrong
message, I think.

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:52.410
What we need to realize, what
people need to understand,

00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:57.660
is that the cooking of
food should take more time.

00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:01.056
We have to re-evaluate
how we spend our time.

00:39:01.056 --> 00:39:02.430
The food companies
said they were

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:04.860
going to make our lives
easier, more convenient,

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:07.710
better by cooking
our food for us.

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:08.802
Has it gotten better?

00:39:08.802 --> 00:39:09.510
Are we healthier?

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:10.690
Do we have more time?

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:11.189
No.

00:39:11.189 --> 00:39:12.210
We have even less time.

00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:13.918
Our food, it couldn't
be more convenient.

00:39:13.918 --> 00:39:15.000
We have even less time.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.830
So what's going on here?

00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:22.410
We need to re-think about
how we allocate our time

00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:24.640
and recognize that
spending time shopping,

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:27.150
cooking, sharing that
cooking with our friends

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:31.510
and our family, and cleaning
up afterwards is valuable.

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:39.400
You don't hear anyone saying,
I really love showering,

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:41.790
I just can't find the time.

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:43.020
No one says that.

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:44.640
We find the time to bathe.

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:46.260
We find the time
to do what we like.

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:48.320
We find the time to watch TV.

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:50.490
Some of us even read still.

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:51.900
I hope so.

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:55.050
It's a matter of recognizing
that the smells of cooking

00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:58.170
in a house are stress-relieving.

00:39:58.170 --> 00:40:00.300
They relax us.

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:03.205
Food brings us together
and makes our lives better.

00:40:03.205 --> 00:40:05.580
So it's a matter of recognizing
the importance of cooking

00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:09.660
and what we give up when we
just put things in a microwave.

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:12.180
Convenience is not
a real convenience.

00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:15.000
And cheapness is a lot more
expensive than we realize.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.520
So it's a way we think
about food and cooking.

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:19.280
And that's mainly
what I care about

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:20.580
and what I try and preach.

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:22.870
And it's preaching, I agree.

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:24.630
But I think it's important.

00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:26.064
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:40:26.064 --> 00:40:27.480
AUDIENCE: In the
book, you go back

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:34.562
to the genesis of
groceries as raw materials

00:40:34.562 --> 00:40:37.020
that you did have to take a
lot of time to process or shell

00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:40.300
or soak or whatnot.

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:43.350
But to some extent, I think
you can buy time today

00:40:43.350 --> 00:40:46.300
by getting pre-cut vegetables
and things like that

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:47.910
and saving on the prep time.

00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:49.800
But you're still
doing the cooking.

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:51.330
And I'm curious,
because I think you

00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:52.470
have a chapter in
there, which is, people

00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:54.230
don't know how to cook anymore.

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:59.940
And they buy arguably nutritious
meals prepared at groceries

00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:00.450
now.

00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:02.965
But are you seeing
that other part,

00:41:02.965 --> 00:41:05.340
which is you take a step back,
which is you still go home

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:06.677
and you cook.

00:41:06.677 --> 00:41:08.760
And there's all different
kinds of online services

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:11.530
now that you can get
someone else to be

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:13.200
your prep chef for you, right?

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:14.340
MICHAEL RUHLMAN: Right.

00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:16.006
AUDIENCE: Are you
seeing more of a trend

00:41:16.006 --> 00:41:19.240
like that to sort of shorten
things in terms of time.

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:21.985
So buying time and yet
still doing cooking at home?

00:41:21.985 --> 00:41:22.860
MICHAEL RUHLMAN: Yes.

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:26.807
Certainly we are finding
that that we want to cook,

00:41:26.807 --> 00:41:28.390
we just don't want
to do all the work,

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:30.390
so we're gonna pay someone
else to do it for us.

00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:33.470
There was a lot of talk
about growing our own food.

00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:35.220
Some people really do
grow their own food.

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:36.261
Bless you for doing that.

00:41:36.261 --> 00:41:37.720
I think it's great.

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:40.740
But for the most part, we didn't
start growing our own food.

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:43.060
What we did was we started
supporting farmers' markets.

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:45.372
We paid other people
to do it for us.

00:41:45.372 --> 00:41:47.330
Now we're getting people
to do our prep for us.

00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:48.780
We're getting Blue
Apron and Hello

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:51.750
Fresh to do our prep for us.

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:54.180
We're buying pre-chopped
onions at the grocery

00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:57.420
store, which I think is fine.

00:41:57.420 --> 00:41:59.980
I think that's fine.

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:02.955
I think if more people
used Fresh Direct--

00:42:02.955 --> 00:42:06.059
not Fresh Direct, Blue
Apron or Hello Fresh,

00:42:06.059 --> 00:42:08.100
they're gonna realize how
easy cooking really is.

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:08.670
They say, oh, my God.

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:09.630
That was so easy.

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:12.660
I know how to get two scallions
together and a clove of garlic

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:15.610
and a protein here.

00:42:15.610 --> 00:42:18.180
And we'll go back to cooking.

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:20.070
They may teach us
how to cook again.

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:22.669
Maybe that's how we
learn to cook again.

00:42:22.669 --> 00:42:24.460
The comment about nobody
knows how to crook

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:27.640
came from the woman who did the
prepared foods at the store.

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:29.050
She said, I'm just astonished.

00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:31.600
Women don't know
how to hold knife.

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:33.280
Nobody knows how
to cook anymore.

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:36.730
And it's possible that a
huge swath of our population,

00:42:36.730 --> 00:42:39.250
because our food
was prepared for us,

00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:41.020
never learned how to cook.

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:41.840
And that's scary.

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:43.530
So we need to
re-learn how to cook.

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:47.740
And I hope places like Blue
Apron help us to do it.

00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:49.750
It is getting more
and more popular.

00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:54.250
And I would say, because
it saves us time,

00:42:54.250 --> 00:42:56.530
if those companies like
Blue Apron can make money--

00:42:56.530 --> 00:42:57.460
I don't think
they're making money

00:42:57.460 --> 00:42:59.020
yet-- if they can
make money, they're

00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:01.270
going to stick around, because
they're saving us time,

00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:02.645
and they're helping
us eat better

00:43:02.645 --> 00:43:03.730
food and nutritious food.

00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:05.900
So I'm all for that.

00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:07.740
Well, thank you very
much for being here.

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:08.780
Cook your own food.

00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:10.130
It makes life better.

00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:12.670
Thanks for listening to
me on my soapbox here.

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:13.520
I appreciate it.

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:14.050
MARK: Thanks so much.

00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:15.175
MICHAEL RUHLMAN: Thank you.

00:43:15.175 --> 00:43:18.300
