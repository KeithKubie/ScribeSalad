[Narrator] So, let me ask you a second quiz.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In particular I would like to know whether distributions

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that can be represented may be unimodal

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
or can also be multimodal.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So, check unimodal if this is all we can do,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
whereas if we can have multiple bumps in our probability distribution,

00:00:19.000 --> 09:59:59.000
check multimodal.
