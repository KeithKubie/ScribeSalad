00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.555
INTERVIEWER:
Hi.

00:00:10.555 --> 00:00:12.666
Can you tell us your name and
what course you are involved

00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:13.270
with?
PROF.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.162
COLEMAN: My name is Charles
Coleman.

00:00:15.162 --> 00:00:18.135
I am an assistant professor in
the Aerospace Engineering

00:00:18.135 --> 00:00:21.162
Department at MIT and I teach
Systems Engineering and the

00:00:21.162 --> 00:00:23.461
Unified Engineering course.
INTERVIEWER:

00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:25.692
And can you tell us what is
going on today for this Unified

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:27.326
Engineering Aerial Competition?
PROF.

00:00:27.326 --> 00:00:30.717
COLEMAN: Today we are running
the 2004 Unified Aerial

00:00:30.717 --> 00:00:33.260
Competition.
There are about 14 teams of

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.717
five students each that are
flying their airplanes and

00:00:36.717 --> 00:00:39.529
demonstrating their systems.
INTERVIEWER:

00:00:39.529 --> 00:00:42.000
How does this relate to the
rest of the Unified course?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.213
PROF.
COLEMAN: Well,

00:00:43.213 --> 00:00:47.045
the systems problems and labs
serve two purposes with Unified

00:00:47.045 --> 00:00:49.153
Engineering.
The first part is the

00:00:49.153 --> 00:00:52.347
laboratories provide an
opportunity for students to

00:00:52.347 --> 00:00:56.179
experimentally verify some of
the theoretical principals they

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:59.373
have learned in class.
The second aspect of systems

00:00:59.373 --> 00:01:03.397
problems allows us to implement
our conceived designed implement

00:01:03.397 --> 00:01:06.207
and operate pedagogy.
And so we have various,

00:01:06.207 --> 00:01:09.720
several exercises throughout
the semester where students

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.211
actually design,
build and operate small

00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:14.657
systems.
INTERVIEWER:

00:01:14.657 --> 00:01:18.000
And this is the CDIO component.
Can you say more about CDIO?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.215
PROF.
COLEMAN: Yes.

00:01:19.215 --> 00:01:22.929
CDIO stands for Conceive,
Design, Implement and Operate.

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:26.575
It is a pedagogical framework
that we have chosen as an

00:01:26.575 --> 00:01:29.411
overarching framework to teach
engineering.

00:01:29.411 --> 00:01:33.530
And the principle behind this
is we sort of want to reduce the

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.717
gap between what engineers do in
real life and what we teach in

00:01:37.717 --> 00:01:40.687
school.
The facts of the matter are

00:01:40.687 --> 00:01:44.125
most people, once they graduate
for practical engineers,

00:01:44.125 --> 00:01:47.062
spend most of their lives
conceiving, designing,

00:01:47.062 --> 00:01:50.562
building and operating things.
So as we teach theoretical

00:01:50.562 --> 00:01:54.312
principles, basic engineering
principles, we want students to

00:01:54.312 --> 00:01:57.937
be able to apply them in the
framework that they would much

00:01:57.937 --> 00:02:00.393
like in their careers.
INTERVIEWER:

00:02:00.393 --> 00:02:01.475
OK.
Can you describe what is going

00:02:01.475 --> 00:02:03.344
to happen today and what the
students have done to prepare

00:02:03.344 --> 00:02:04.328
for this event?
PROF.

00:02:04.328 --> 00:02:06.887
COLEMAN: Oh,
yes, that would be a lot of

00:02:06.887 --> 00:02:09.183
fun.
I have assigned the students to

00:02:09.183 --> 00:02:11.545
design a system.
And I teach a simple

00:02:11.545 --> 00:02:14.695
decomposition of systems.
It is not the only one.

00:02:14.695 --> 00:02:18.370
And I teach students that
systems are composed of people,

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.979
products and procedures that
have to operate together to

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:24.734
deliver value.
And you can sort of think of

00:02:24.734 --> 00:02:29.000
value as going in the opposite
direction of money.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.075
Systems are fairly general.
This breakdown works anywhere

00:02:33.075 --> 00:02:36.349
for Disney World,
people, product and process,

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.769
lawyering, and even to things
like the military.

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.971
In particular,
today they have about a set of

00:02:42.971 --> 00:02:46.100
four functional requirements,
build a plane,

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.812
train a pilot and a crew,
and the task is to fly two

00:02:49.812 --> 00:02:53.887
empty laps, land the plane,
load it with anywhere between

00:02:53.887 --> 00:02:57.161
one or four eggs,
and then fly as long as they

00:02:57.161 --> 00:03:01.457
can with their payload.
And then they also have to

00:03:01.457 --> 00:03:05.046
minimize the amount of time that
they spend on the ground loading

00:03:05.046 --> 00:03:07.233
the eggs.
So that is what is going to go

00:03:07.233 --> 00:03:09.252
on today.
We are going to see how the

00:03:09.252 --> 00:03:12.000
students perform based on their
estimates.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.354
INTERVIEWER:
And how long have the students

00:03:13.354 --> 00:03:14.306
prepared for this?
PROF.

00:03:14.306 --> 00:03:16.877
COLEMAN: Oh,
the students have been working

00:03:16.877 --> 00:03:20.673
for approximately nine weeks for
about four hours per week with

00:03:20.673 --> 00:03:24.163
five people per team and with
training from us and various

00:03:24.163 --> 00:03:26.318
materials and supplies.
INTERVIEWER:

00:03:26.318 --> 00:03:27.460
Any predictions about how it is
going to go?

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.000
Are we going to see a lot of
spilled eggs do you think?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.401
PROF.
COLEMAN: I hope we don't see a

00:03:31.401 --> 00:03:34.833
lot of spilled eggs.
One of the learning objectives

00:03:34.833 --> 00:03:37.647
of the course for me is for
every student,

00:03:37.647 --> 00:03:40.941
every group to have a
successful systems building

00:03:40.941 --> 00:03:43.205
experience.
So a broken egg is not

00:03:43.205 --> 00:03:46.911
necessarily a bad thing.
You learn how to build systems

00:03:46.911 --> 00:03:50.137
by building systems.
And I think a unique aspect

00:03:50.137 --> 00:03:54.323
about this part of the course is
that you can actually learn a

00:03:54.323 --> 00:03:57.378
lot from your failures.
INTERVIEWER:

00:03:57.378 --> 00:03:58.768
So, in other words,
you cannot learn to build

00:03:58.768 --> 00:04:00.000
aircraft without breaking some
eggs.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.117
PROF.
COLEMAN: True.

00:04:01.117 --> 00:04:02.352
That is true.
INTERVIEWER:

00:04:02.352 --> 00:04:03.323
OK.
Well, thanks for your time and

00:04:03.323 --> 00:04:05.000
thanks for sharing your
materials with OpenCourseWare.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.546
PROF.
COLEMAN: Yup.

00:04:05.546 --> 00:04:06.546
Thank you.
