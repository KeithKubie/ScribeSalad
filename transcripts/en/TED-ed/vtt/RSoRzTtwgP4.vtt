00:00:08.413 --> 00:00:11.747
We read fiction for many reasons.

00:00:11.747 --> 00:00:12.747
To be entertained,

00:00:12.747 --> 00:00:15.000
to find out who done it,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.049
to travel to strange, new planets,

00:00:18.049 --> 00:00:19.169
to be scared,

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:19.911
to laugh,

00:00:19.911 --> 00:00:21.290
to cry,

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:22.028
to think,

00:00:22.028 --> 00:00:23.153
to feel,

00:00:23.153 --> 00:00:28.294
to be so absorbed that for a while
we forget where we are.

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:30.954
So, how about writing fiction?

00:00:30.954 --> 00:00:33.559
How do you suck your readers
into your stories?

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.983
With an exciting plot? Maybe.

00:00:35.983 --> 00:00:38.715
Fascinating characters? Probably.

00:00:38.715 --> 00:00:43.401
Beautiful language? Perhaps.

00:00:43.401 --> 00:00:48.344
"Billie's legs are noodles. The ends of
her hair are poison needles.

00:00:48.344 --> 00:00:53.414
Her tongue is a bristly sponge,
and her eyes are bags of bleach."

00:00:53.414 --> 00:00:57.590
Did that description almost make you feel
as queasy as Billie?

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.803
We grasp that Billie's legs 
aren't actually noodles.

00:01:00.803 --> 00:01:04.268
To Billie, they feel 
as limp as cooked noodles.

00:01:04.268 --> 00:01:07.223
It's an implied comparison, a metaphor.

00:01:07.223 --> 00:01:10.239
So, why not simply write it like this?

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:12.961
"Billie feels nauseated and weak."

00:01:12.961 --> 00:01:18.000
Chances are the second description
wasn't as vivid to you as the first.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.118
The point of fiction is to cast a spell,

00:01:21.118 --> 00:01:25.769
a momentary illusion that you are living
in the world of the story.

00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:28.077
Fiction engages the senses,

00:01:28.077 --> 00:01:30.723
helps us create vivid mental simulacra

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:33.571
of the experiences 
the characters are having.

00:01:33.571 --> 00:01:37.329
Stage and screen engage 
some of our senses directly.

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:41.727
We see and hear the interactions
of the characters and the setting.

00:01:41.727 --> 00:01:43.297
But with prose fiction,

00:01:43.297 --> 00:01:47.531
all you have is static symbols
on a contrasting background.

00:01:47.531 --> 00:01:51.803
If you describe the story
in matter of fact, non-tactile language,

00:01:51.803 --> 00:01:54.211
the spell risks being a weak one.

00:01:54.211 --> 00:01:57.959
Your reader may not get much beyond
interpreting the squiggles.

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:00.171
She will understand 
what Billie feels like,

00:02:00.171 --> 00:02:03.762
but she won't feel what Billie feels.

00:02:03.762 --> 00:02:07.454
She'll be reading, not immersed
in the world of the story,

00:02:07.454 --> 00:02:12.753
discovering the truths of Billie's life
at the same time that Billie herself does.

00:02:12.753 --> 00:02:15.667
Fiction plays with our senses:

00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:16.528
taste,

00:02:16.528 --> 00:02:17.658
smell,

00:02:17.658 --> 00:02:18.709
touch,

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:19.900
hearing,

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.240
sight,

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.135
and the sense of motion.

00:02:23.135 --> 00:02:28.786
It also plays with our ability to abstract
and make complex associations.

00:02:28.786 --> 00:02:30.816
Look at the following sentence.

00:02:30.816 --> 00:02:32.965
"The world was ghost-quiet,

00:02:32.965 --> 00:02:38.106
except for the crack of sails
and the burbling of water against hull."

00:02:38.106 --> 00:02:40.769
The words, "quiet," "crack," 
and "burbling,"

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.465
engage the sense of hearing.

00:02:43.465 --> 00:02:47.288
Notice that Buckell doesn't use
the generic word sound.

00:02:47.288 --> 00:02:52.752
Each word he chooses evokes 
a particular quality of sound.

00:02:52.752 --> 00:02:56.280
Then, like an artist laying 
on washes of color

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.142
to give the sense 
of texture to a painting,

00:02:59.142 --> 00:03:03.723
he adds anoter layer, motion,
"the crack of sails,"

00:03:03.723 --> 00:03:08.186
and touch, 
"the burbling of water against hull."

00:03:08.186 --> 00:03:11.174
Finally, he gives us 
an abstract connection

00:03:11.174 --> 00:03:14.574
by linking the word quiet
with the word ghost.

00:03:14.574 --> 00:03:16.843
Not "quiet as a ghost,"

00:03:16.843 --> 00:03:18.944
which would put 
a distancing layer of simile

00:03:18.944 --> 00:03:21.324
between the reader and the experience.

00:03:21.324 --> 00:03:25.626
Instead, Buckell creates 
the metaphor "ghost-quiet"

00:03:25.626 --> 00:03:29.132
for an implied, 
rather than overt, comparison.

00:03:29.132 --> 00:03:31.790
Writers are always told to avoid cliches

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.232
because there's very little engagement
for the reader in an overused image,

00:03:36.232 --> 00:03:38.482
such as "red as a rose."

00:03:38.482 --> 00:03:39.251
But give them,

00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:42.083
"Love...began on a beach.

00:03:42.083 --> 00:03:47.083
It began that day when Jacob saw Anette
in her stewed-cherry dress,"

00:03:47.083 --> 00:03:49.783
and their brains engage 
in the absorbing task

00:03:49.783 --> 00:03:53.186
of figuring out what 
a stewed-cherry dress is like.

00:03:53.186 --> 00:03:56.809
Suddenly, they're on a beach
about to fall in love.

00:03:56.809 --> 00:04:01.498
They're experiencing the story
at both a visceral and a conceptual level,

00:04:01.498 --> 00:04:04.188
meeting the writer halfway
in the imaginative play

00:04:04.188 --> 00:04:07.986
of creating a dynamic world
of the senses.

00:04:07.986 --> 00:04:11.135
So when you write, 
use well-chosen words

00:04:11.135 --> 00:04:16.341
to engage sound, sight, taste,
touch, smell, and movement.

00:04:16.341 --> 00:04:20.758
Then create unexpected connotations
among your story elements,

00:04:20.758 --> 00:04:24.666
and set your readers' brushfire 
imaginations alight.
