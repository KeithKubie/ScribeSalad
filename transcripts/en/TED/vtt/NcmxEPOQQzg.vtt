00:00:12.794 --> 00:00:14.920
I want to tell you a story about Manson.

00:00:17.214 --> 00:00:21.307
Manson was this 28-year-old
interior designer,

00:00:21.331 --> 00:00:23.149
a father to a loving daughter,

00:00:23.572 --> 00:00:25.651
and a son

00:00:25.675 --> 00:00:29.431
who found himself behind bars
due to a broken-down judicial system.

00:00:30.516 --> 00:00:33.728
He was framed for a murder
he didn't commit

00:00:33.752 --> 00:00:35.599
and was sentenced to the gallows.

00:00:36.855 --> 00:00:40.871
There were two victims of this murder --
the victim who actually died in the murder

00:00:40.895 --> 00:00:43.576
and Manson, who had been
sentenced to prison

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.538
for an offense which he did not commit.

00:00:47.419 --> 00:00:49.791
He was locked up in a cell,
eight by seven,

00:00:49.815 --> 00:00:51.402
with 13 other grown-up men

00:00:52.262 --> 00:00:54.134
for 23 and a half hours a day.

00:00:55.188 --> 00:00:58.593
Food was not guaranteed that you'd get.

00:00:59.688 --> 00:01:00.949
And I remember yesterday,

00:01:00.973 --> 00:01:04.046
as I walked into the room where I was,

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.410
I imagined the kind of cell
that Manson would have been living in.

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:08.834
Because the toilet --

00:01:09.371 --> 00:01:10.680
The row of the small rooms

00:01:10.704 --> 00:01:14.042
that were there were slightly bigger
than the eight-by-seven cell.

00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:17.146
But being in that cell
as he awaited the executioner --

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.463
because in prison,
he did not have a name --

00:01:20.292 --> 00:01:22.132
Manson was known by a number.

00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:23.894
He was just a statistic.

00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:27.815
He did not know how long he would wait.

00:01:28.323 --> 00:01:30.077
The wait could have been a minute,

00:01:30.101 --> 00:01:32.371
the executioner could have come
the next minute,

00:01:32.395 --> 00:01:33.768
the next day,

00:01:33.792 --> 00:01:35.513
or it could have taken 30 years.

00:01:37.511 --> 00:01:38.845
The wait had no end.

00:01:40.194 --> 00:01:43.075
And in the midst of the excruciating pain,

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:44.365
the mental torture,

00:01:46.061 --> 00:01:48.795
the many unanswered questions
that Manson faced,

00:01:50.411 --> 00:01:52.822
he knew he was not
going to play the victim.

00:01:53.331 --> 00:01:55.648
He refused to play the role of the victim.

00:01:56.497 --> 00:01:59.863
He was angry at the justice system
that had put him behind bars.

00:02:01.188 --> 00:02:04.117
But he knew the only way
he could change that justice system

00:02:04.141 --> 00:02:06.354
or help other people get justice

00:02:06.378 --> 00:02:07.799
was not to play the victim.

00:02:09.435 --> 00:02:13.673
Change came to Manson
when he decided to embrace forgiveness

00:02:13.697 --> 00:02:15.447
for those who had put him in prison.

00:02:17.784 --> 00:02:19.943
I speak that as a fact.

00:02:20.776 --> 00:02:22.408
Because I know who Manson is.

00:02:24.403 --> 00:02:25.553
I am Manson.

00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:28.812
My real name is Peter Manson Ouko.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.783
And after my conviction,

00:02:31.807 --> 00:02:34.207
after that awakening of forgiveness,

00:02:35.318 --> 00:02:36.468
I had this move

00:02:37.826 --> 00:02:39.269
to help change the system.

00:02:40.318 --> 00:02:43.182
I already decided I was not
going to be a victim anymore.

00:02:44.276 --> 00:02:46.585
But how was I going to help
change a system

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:49.720
that was bringing in
younger inmates every day

00:02:49.744 --> 00:02:51.601
who deserve to be with their families?

00:02:52.862 --> 00:02:56.719
So I started mobilizing my colleagues
in prison, my fellow inmates,

00:02:56.743 --> 00:03:00.950
to write letters and memoranda
to the justice system,

00:03:00.974 --> 00:03:03.101
to the Judicial Service Commission,

00:03:03.125 --> 00:03:06.236
the numerous task forces
that had been set up

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.934
in our country, Kenya,

00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.767
to help change the constitution.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.799
And we decided to grasp at those --

00:03:12.823 --> 00:03:15.934
to clutch at those straws,
if I may use that word --

00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.355
if only to make the justice system work,

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:19.529
and work for all.

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:22.966
Just about the same time,

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.815
I met a young university
graduate from the UK,

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:27.439
called Alexander McLean.

00:03:28.228 --> 00:03:31.713
Alexander had come in with three or four
of his colleagues from university

00:03:31.737 --> 00:03:32.903
in their gap year,

00:03:32.927 --> 00:03:35.260
and they wanted to help assist,

00:03:35.284 --> 00:03:38.370
set up a library in Kamiti Maximum Prison,

00:03:38.394 --> 00:03:39.546
which if you Google,

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.767
you will see is written as one
of the 15 worst prisons in the world.

00:03:43.784 --> 00:03:44.934
That was then.

00:03:45.307 --> 00:03:46.760
But when Alexander came in,

00:03:46.784 --> 00:03:48.680
he was a young 20-year-old boy.

00:03:48.704 --> 00:03:50.505
And I was on death row at that time.

00:03:51.696 --> 00:03:53.506
And we took him under our wing.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.299
It was an honest trust issue.

00:03:56.323 --> 00:03:58.577
He trusted us, even though
we were on death row.

00:03:59.157 --> 00:04:00.402
And through that trust,

00:04:00.426 --> 00:04:03.022
we saw him and his colleagues
from the university

00:04:03.046 --> 00:04:06.681
refurbish the library
with the latest technology

00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:10.649
and set up the infirmary
to very good standards

00:04:10.673 --> 00:04:13.458
so that those of us falling sick in prison

00:04:13.482 --> 00:04:16.355
would not necessarily
have to die in indignity.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.164
Having met Alexander,

00:04:20.188 --> 00:04:21.347
I had a chance,

00:04:21.371 --> 00:04:24.783
and he gave me the opportunity
and the support,

00:04:24.807 --> 00:04:28.112
to enroll for a university degree
at the University of London.

00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.339
Just like Mandela
studied from South Africa,

00:04:31.363 --> 00:04:34.601
I had a chance to study
at Kamiti Maximum Security Prison.

00:04:35.498 --> 00:04:37.164
And two years later,

00:04:37.188 --> 00:04:39.696
I became the first graduate of the program

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.204
from the University of London
from within the prison system.

00:04:44.744 --> 00:04:46.664
Having graduated, what happened next --

00:04:46.688 --> 00:04:50.193
(Applause)

00:04:50.217 --> 00:04:51.367
Thank you.

00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:52.474
(Applause)

00:04:52.498 --> 00:04:53.990
Having graduated,

00:04:54.014 --> 00:04:55.414
now I felt empowered.

00:04:56.014 --> 00:04:58.458
I was not going to play
the helpless victim.

00:04:58.823 --> 00:05:01.577
But I felt empowered
not only to assist myself,

00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:03.450
to prosecute my own case,

00:05:03.474 --> 00:05:06.529
but also to assist the other inmates

00:05:06.553 --> 00:05:10.386
who are suffering the similar injustices
that have just been spoken about here.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.887
So I started writing
legal briefs for them.

00:05:13.911 --> 00:05:17.409
With my other colleagues in prison,
we did as much as we could.

00:05:19.743 --> 00:05:21.090
That wasn't enough.

00:05:23.022 --> 00:05:24.934
Alexander McLean

00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:28.688
and his team
at the African Prisons Project

00:05:28.712 --> 00:05:30.609
decided to support more inmates.

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:32.533
And as I'm speaking to you today,

00:05:32.561 --> 00:05:36.696
there are 63 inmates and staff
in the Kenya Prison Service

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.045
studying law at the University of London
through distance learning.

00:05:40.903 --> 00:05:45.934
(Applause)

00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:49.712
These are changemakers
who are being motivated

00:05:49.736 --> 00:05:52.879
not only to assist
the most indolent in society,

00:05:52.903 --> 00:05:56.641
but also to help the inmates
and others get access to justice.

00:05:59.125 --> 00:06:02.373
Down there in my prison cell,
something kept stirring me.

00:06:03.584 --> 00:06:06.101
The words of Martin Luther King
kept hitting me.

00:06:07.822 --> 00:06:10.807
And he was always telling me,
"Pete, if you can't fly,

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:13.520
you can run.

00:06:14.395 --> 00:06:16.260
And if you can't run,

00:06:16.284 --> 00:06:17.434
you can walk.

00:06:18.133 --> 00:06:20.125
But if you can't walk,

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:21.626
then you can crawl.

00:06:22.331 --> 00:06:24.593
But whatever it is, whatever it takes,

00:06:24.617 --> 00:06:25.950
just keep on moving."

00:06:26.831 --> 00:06:29.172
And so I had this urge to keep moving.

00:06:29.196 --> 00:06:31.950
I still have this urge
to keep moving in whatever I do.

00:06:31.974 --> 00:06:35.418
Because I feel the only way
we can change our society,

00:06:35.442 --> 00:06:37.718
the only way we can change
the justice system --

00:06:37.742 --> 00:06:39.751
which has really improved
in our country --

00:06:39.775 --> 00:06:41.402
is to help get the systems right.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.672
So, on 26th October last year,
after 18 years in prison,

00:06:47.482 --> 00:06:49.886
I walked out of prison
on presidential pardon.

00:06:51.061 --> 00:06:54.307
I'm now focused on helping APP --
the African Prisons Project --

00:06:54.331 --> 00:06:57.392
achieve its mandate
of training and setting up

00:06:57.416 --> 00:07:00.903
the first law school
and legal college behind bars.

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:03.006
Where we are going to train --

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:06.942
(Applause)

00:07:06.966 --> 00:07:10.490
Where we are going to train
inmates and staff

00:07:10.514 --> 00:07:12.791
not only to assist their fellow inmates,

00:07:12.815 --> 00:07:15.910
but to assist the entire
wider society of the poor

00:07:15.934 --> 00:07:18.016
who cannot access legal justice.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.603
So as I speak before you today,

00:07:21.627 --> 00:07:27.198
I stand here in the full knowledge
that we can all reexamine ourselves,

00:07:27.222 --> 00:07:29.984
we can all reexamine our situations,

00:07:30.008 --> 00:07:32.541
we can all reexamine our circumstances

00:07:33.959 --> 00:07:36.226
and not play the victim narrative.

00:07:36.792 --> 00:07:38.990
The victim narrative
will not take us anywhere.

00:07:40.149 --> 00:07:41.749
I was behind bars, yeah.

00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.286
But I never felt and I was not a prisoner.

00:07:48.236 --> 00:07:50.561
The basic thing I got to learn

00:07:50.585 --> 00:07:52.863
was that if I thought,

00:07:52.887 --> 00:07:55.069
and if you think, you can,

00:07:55.093 --> 00:07:56.243
you will.

00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:59.346
But if you sit thinking that you can't,

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:00.520
you won't.

00:08:01.593 --> 00:08:03.126
It's as simple as that.

00:08:04.259 --> 00:08:06.760
And so I'm encouraged
by the peaceful revolutionaries

00:08:06.784 --> 00:08:08.060
I've heard on this stage.

00:08:08.633 --> 00:08:11.434
The world needs you now,
the world needs you today.

00:08:12.394 --> 00:08:14.982
And as I finish my talk,

00:08:15.006 --> 00:08:18.254
I'd just like to ask
each and every single one of you here,

00:08:19.744 --> 00:08:23.625
wonderful thinkers,
changemakers, innovators,

00:08:23.649 --> 00:08:26.752
the wonderful global citizens
we have at TED,

00:08:26.776 --> 00:08:29.259
just remember the words
of Martin Luther King.

00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.545
Let them continue ringing
in your heart and your life.

00:08:33.252 --> 00:08:35.035
Whatever it is,

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:36.685
wherever you are,

00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:38.392
whatever it takes,

00:08:38.416 --> 00:08:39.567
keep on moving.

00:08:39.591 --> 00:08:40.750
Thank you.

00:08:40.774 --> 00:08:44.151
(Applause)

00:08:44.175 --> 00:08:45.326
Thank you.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:49.611
(Applause)
