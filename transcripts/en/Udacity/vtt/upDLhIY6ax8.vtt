00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This first option is the one that makes us happy.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Higher precedence means it gets done first.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It's on the inside of the parentheses, so I really need this part

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
with the colon, -1--that has to be inside all the parentheses,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and not len. This is the wrong approach.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And then associates to the left means that

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
we typically want our parentheses to look like this--

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
they're grouped off to the left as much as possible.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So here we have 1, 2, 3--we remove one element,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and then we remove one element from the rest of it, and then we compute the length.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Here we are in the Python interpreter, and I'm just going to show you that

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
this subrange operator actually does associate to the left in Python.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Here I have more or less two versions of the same expression,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
where taking 1, 2, 3--chopping off all but the last element--

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
chopping off all but the last element again.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So our list is going to go down from three elements to two elements to one.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Here I have the original expression, and here I have the original expression with added parentheses,

00:00:50.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and we look down and see that they both get the same answer.
