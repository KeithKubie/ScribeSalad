00:00:01.616 --> 00:00:02.430
DAN: Hello, everybody.

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.630
Thanks for coming today.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:06.040
I'm Dan.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.250
A few years ago, through a
curious turn of events, I

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.380
inherited the job of approving
Andrew's use of the official

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.440
Android trademark.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.340
Which means that I get to see
all of his designs before

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.590
anybody else.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.790
And so when they asked me to
introduce him, I've got a few

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:25.760
stories, as you might imagine.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.100
But I knew immediately there's
only one story that I could

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.490
tell, which is this.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.080
As I'm sure you guys all
remember, if you follow the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.150
little vinyl bug droid figurines
and all, in series

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.430
one, one of the designs was
just a green, straight up

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.360
green, bug droid.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.335
But in series two, there was one
that was a blue, straight

00:00:45.335 --> 00:00:47.386
up blue, bug droid, which
I always thought

00:00:47.386 --> 00:00:48.610
was a little odd.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.720
And then in series three,
there was a red one.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.850
I'm like, oh, that's
kind of cool.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.730
And then a few months
ago, I saw the

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.500
designs for series four.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.640
And there is this kind of like
orangey, yellowish one on

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.870
there, too.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.950
And I'm like, oh my
God, this is an

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:05.990
opportunity not to be missed.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.580
So I pound off this email,
and I'm like, dude.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.010
I'm like, what you need to do
is that orangey gold one

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.380
there, you need to make
that Google yellow.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.740
Because then we;ll have all
four of the Google colors.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.730
And if you're a long-term
collector, you can set these

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.310
up in Google colors.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.510
I'm like, this is such
a great idea, right?

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:22.830
So a few minutes later,
I get a response.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.900
And he says, yeah, that's
actually your laptop's color

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.970
reproduction.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.380
It will be Google yellow.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.540
He's like, I had this
planned all along.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.630
DAN: And so I became
enlightened.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.220
And so I'd just like to say,
thanks for all your hard work.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.080
Welcome.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.390
And thank you for coming.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.880
ANDREW BELL: Thanks.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.300
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.570
ANDREW BELL: Hello, everybody.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.770
Thanks for taking time out of
your day to come listen to me

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.940
talk and look at some
of my art work.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.320
I'm just going to go through my
art and my career a little

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.970
bit, show you some of the work
I've been working on for the

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.990
last couple years,
how I got there.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.060
And then we'll move on to some
Android stuff after that.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.870
And then we'll take some
questions at the end.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:06.860
So let's get started.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.259
Any of you guys in any
art-related department here?

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.140
No.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.960
I know there's one small
one in the corner

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.630
of the other building.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:17.230
All right.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.850
That's good.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.950
Hopefully this will all work.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.910
This is the story of how I--

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:22.610
it's kind of dark--

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.110
accidentally became a
professional artist.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.050
So this is my childhood.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.180
ANDREW BELL: That's going to
mess anyone up, right?

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.650
ANDREW BELL: I was destined to
be something other than a

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.470
doctor or a lawyer
from that point.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.520
I had to work out some
serious issues.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.232
This was actually in 19--

00:02:45.232 --> 00:02:47.380
probably the very early
'80s in England.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.280
I was born in England.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.980
And being in England, some of
my early influences was this

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.050
guy, Postman Pat.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.530
He was one of the early Bob the
Builder style, stop motion

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.240
animations.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.390
And then moved on to
Danger Mouse--

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.630
awesome cartoon out
of England.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.190
And as I got older, I got
a little cooler, started

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.310
skateboarding.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.960
If any of you skateboard, you'd
probably recognize this,

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.700
by an artist named Jim Phillips
out of California.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.630
Very iconic.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.640
And then reading comics.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.030
One of my favorite one was
"Bloom County." I didn't

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.260
really understand it when I was
reading it, but I loved

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.750
the art style, the design.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:29.000
And then as I got a little bit
older, I got a computed.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.795
I was lucky enough to have a
father who was a bit of an

00:03:30.795 --> 00:03:31.380
early adopter.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.320
We had one of the
first CD drives.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.655
It was like this big.

00:03:35.655 --> 00:03:37.890
And we had an Apple
2E, Apple 2C.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.510
So I learned Logo basic.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.230
And the first thing I did with
it was try to draw with it.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.710
This is not from the Apple.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.400
This is a little later.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.530
But I got a computer, and
I saw the computer as an

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.310
opportunity to be creative, not
just as an opportunity to

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.470
do spreadsheets.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.210
So eventually we got a 386sx-16

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.140
with 16 color monitor.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.860
And it was amazing.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.470
So I started doing some
ASCII artwork.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.620
I ran a BBS for a while
called Apocalypse.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.830
And you can actually
read that.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.770
It says apocalypse.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.190
Then eventually, I moved up to
all 16 colors and started

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.554
incorporating some of the
artwork I grew up on and loved

00:04:18.554 --> 00:04:21.860
as a kid into ANSI graphics,
which is just translating

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.210
comics and things for bulletin
board system logins.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.790
Are there any BBS nerds?

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.195
Anyone old enough?

00:04:28.195 --> 00:04:28.985
[LAUGHS]

00:04:28.985 --> 00:04:30.120
We've got a couple.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.110
Everyone else is like,
what's happening?

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.290
ANDREW BELL: And then this is
kind of where I went wrong.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.515
I wasn't destroyed
by a Terminator.

00:04:39.515 --> 00:04:40.910
It was more so this.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.410
It was when I saw the computer,
it wasn't just this

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.040
little toy to play around on
and make little graphics.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.030
This was a serious tool.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.580
I was kind of blindsided
by this.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.950
No other art mattered anymore.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.630
When I was growing up, I used
to draw and doodle and make

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:56.270
clay sculptures.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.100
And then I saw this--

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.910
I can make things
real with this.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.220
This is amazing.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.750
This is the future.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.940
And so when I got old enough to
go to college, I decided to

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.500
go to art school.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.970
Oh, I forgot that slide.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:11.960
Sorry.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:12.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.560
ANDREW BELL: But instead of
picking art school based on

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.130
what the best our program would
be or where the best

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.200
teachers were, I picked it on
who had the best computers.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.880
I went to a few different
schools, and that's what

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.260
really mattered to me.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.530
So I ended up going to the
School of Visual Arts, in

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.562
Manhattan, because they had a
lab filled with SGIs, which I

00:05:29.562 --> 00:05:32.230
guess is appropriate for
this building, right?

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.980
I was like, whoa, these are the
things I've seen on that

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.020
one TV special they put out
about CGI before it was

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.620
popular or people knew it was.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.900
And I was just blown away.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.930
So I spent years ignoring
the fine art side.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.650
I still had to take drawing
and painting classes.

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.080
But I was focused on the
computer as not a

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.630
tool, as the tool.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.280
I was kind of one-track
minded.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.930
I did some OK stuff.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.810
This is my thesis project about
killer teddy bears.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.810
[CHUCKLES]

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.080
And a bit of an aside--

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.330
for the end of the thesis
project, you need to have some

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.880
sort of logo graphic
or something.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.480
So in case anyone's wondering
where my company name came

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.970
from, my company's Dead Zebra,
Inc. And everyone wonders,

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.230
how'd you come up with that?

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.770
It was a joke in college, is
how I came up with that.

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.660
And it's since been abstracted
a bit to the current logo I

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.200
still use today.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.800
So fast forward a few years.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.110
I couldn't find a job in New
York doing 3-D animation.

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.860
There wasn't really too
much going on there.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.030
Blue Sky was still working
on "Ice Age" one.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.080
It hadn't come out yet.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.770
I think there was Rhythm &amp;
Hues doing commercials.

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.250
But wasn't too much to be had.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.610
And no offense to California,
but I didn't want to come out

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.040
to California.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.410
All the 3-D jobs were in LA.

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:48.880
And being in New York for a few
years, I just fell in love

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:49.390
with New York.

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:52.560
And I couldn't see myself
driving everywhere.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.650
So I was lucky enough when I
was in college to get an

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.000
internship at Marvel Comics,
which was great.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.110
Just randomly, from my
experience in the past doing

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.600
computer graphics and putting
together some crappy little

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.940
web pages, someone said, hey,
come work for free for us.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.160
So all right, sounds great.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.500
And eventually that turned
into a little job.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.670
And then eventually that job
turned into another job at

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.260
Nickelodeon.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.560
So I was at Nickelodeon
for five years.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.600
And while there, these
guys were born.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.790
This is 2002.

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.840
And this is the reason
I am an independent

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:28.740
professional artist.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:29.390
It's not Apple.

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:30.090
It's not a Mac.

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:32.366
It's because this
computer sucked.

00:07:32.366 --> 00:07:33.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.525
ANDREW BELL: I'll explain.

00:07:35.525 --> 00:07:38.320
So every time this computer that
I worked on-- not this

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.280
exact one, but one
very similar--

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.360
it would crash several
times a day.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.980
And it would take about 5
to 10 minutes to reboot.

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:46.900
I don't know if it was the
software on there or the

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:47.840
networking or what.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.320
But it was awful, and it
was a waste of time.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.975
So every time it would crash,
I would just grab a little

00:07:52.975 --> 00:07:55.920
note card or a Post-it Note
and draw something on the

00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:00.030
side, not actively thinking,
oh, I'm getting back into

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:00.330
illustration.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:00.990
This is great.

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:03.330
Just thinking I need to kill
five minutes and look like I'm

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.740
doing something so I
don't get fired.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:06.490
And they're not very good.

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:07.640
There's like a pickle
with legs.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.970
I don't even know
what that is.

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:10.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:12.780
ANDREW BELL: But I mean, it
happened often enough that

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:13.890
this is my desk after awhile.

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:16.210
You can see, I just started
putting them up on my cubicle

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.310
and around up top there.

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:22.170
And after a few months, I had
100 something little monsters

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:24.480
lying around.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.490
And so being as savvy as I am,
I thought, ah, the internet.

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:28.780
I should put them
on the internet.

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:29.690
That's a great idea.

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:33.390
Other people should see me
wasting time, so it's not just

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:35.809
my coworkers.

00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:38.400
So using my rudimentary
skills--

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.179
this is my first website.

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:45.100
It was built on PHP,
some HTML.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.380
And it was built so crappily
that if I didn't upload a new

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.982
drawing every day, the site
would crash completely.

00:08:51.982 --> 00:08:53.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:57.655
ANDREW BELL: That was good
motivation for me to practice.

00:08:57.655 --> 00:08:59.240
Because it would take my
email down, with it.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.085
I mean, it was that bad.

00:09:00.085 --> 00:09:00.390
[LAUGHS]

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:02.650
I really didn't know
what I was doing.

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:06.850
But I ended up keeping up
the schedule for years.

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:09.780
I had to force myself into it
because I was still getting

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.750
out of that mindset as the
computer as the tool.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.810
I had go a long way
around there.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:17.680
So I started put them
up, new drawings.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.000
I Actually, I put out some black
and white screen prints,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.900
just mostly for myself
and my friends.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.160
And then people were going
to the website

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.140
on a regular basis.

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.280
I had some friends doing web
comics and comic books, and

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.210
they shared my link.

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:33.690
Back in the day, there may have
been some web rings, if

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:35.920
anyone remembers those
web rings.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.360
And eventually I
put a t-shirt.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.310
And people bought it-- maybe
like a dozen people.

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:44.120
But to me that was
blowing my mind.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.540
And this little stapled-together
book with

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:49.380
some of my drawings in
black and white.

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.970
And over the years,
the drawings got

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:51.860
a little bit better.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.620
The website got a bit better.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.160
It no longer crashed
all the time.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.940
But I did was to keep up my
daily schedule for, I think,

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:00.630
six or seven years straight,
which is kind of crazy now

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:01.370
that I think about it.

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:04.560
I didn't have much of
a life in general.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.020
I took out some ads
in some magazines.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:10.860
Still doing this all on the
side while I was at work.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.480
Drew some more creatures.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.090
Drew some more creatures.

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:15.720
Drew some more creatures.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.660
A few more.

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.440
Kept going.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.950
And eventually, I had a pretty
good stable full of monsters

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:23.850
to deal with.

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:27.980
So armed with all my monsters
and a book and some new

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.480
t-shirt designs, and
a toy-- we'll talk

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.170
about those more later--

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:36.820
the next obvious step was to
head to Comic-Con, where I

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:40.820
could really meet the fans one
on one and talk to people and

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.310
have a really close
interpersonal relationship

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:45.430
with everyone.

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:47.100
Oh, yeah.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.720
This is Comic-Con.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.920
I'm here, somewhere, I think.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:51.450
Oh, yeah, here I am.

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:54.305
That's my booth.

00:10:54.305 --> 00:10:56.640
All right, luckily, I'd done
some smaller Comic-Cons before

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.040
that, so I wasn't totally
blown away.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.070
But here's proof that I can
actually interact with fans at

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:03.860
Comic-Con on one on one basis.

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:08.280
And I got a chance to be
spontaneous, talk to people,

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.630
draw on the spot, doodle
for people.

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:13.140
Probably done thousands of
doodles, just people that walk

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.160
up to the booth.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:21.080
And this was 2005, when I said,
all right, I've got

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.030
enough people that are buying
some t-shirts and prints from

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:27.550
me, that know about me, that I'm
going to quit my job and

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:29.800
see how it goes for--

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.320
I'll give myself six
months to a year.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.780
That was seven years ago,
so still going OK.

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:40.010
I started taking my drawing
over there.

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.880
This is an art show at a little
toy store in New York

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.150
called Kidrobot.

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:45.190
Has anyone seen that?

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:46.510
This is in their original
store, and so

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:47.560
it was pretty tiny.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.630
So just art among
the merchandise.

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:53.210
But for me, that was
a pretty big step.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:55.280
And then I got a gallery show.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.840
So my first solo gallery show,
I decided to tackle the tiny,

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.920
easy to deal with subject
of everything

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.350
between life and death--

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:03.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.890
ANDREW BELL: --in the form of
different chromosomes in the

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:09.920
artwork, and everything in
between that, including

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.765
viruses, tumors, parasites.

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:19.510
This is a little sculpture with
eggs and skulls together.

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:22.880
And if anyone's ever been to
New York for an extended

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.140
period of time or is in the
art scene, you've probably

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.510
been to hundreds of
gallery shows.

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:28.950
I know I have.

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:30.460
And they get boring.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:31.570
They blend together.

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:33.930
They're just art
on white walls.

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:39.550
And I realized that, and my
artwork is no exception.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:41.710
So I think one of the best
things to do in that situation

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:44.380
is to try to create an
experience, something that

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:45.190
people will remember.

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:46.860
I think Google's really good at
that, especially with the

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.430
Google Doodle team.

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:50.810
So you go to the home
page and there's

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:53.150
something to interact with.

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:54.960
You kind of forget just if
you go to the Google

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:55.710
page, there's a logo.

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:56.180
It's fine.

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:58.280
But if you go there and you
can actually experience

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.480
something, you're going
to remember that.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:03.130
Sometimes it's as simple as
painting a wall and creating

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:06.810
context for your artwork and
products to live in, just

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:07.720
adding some graphics.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.720
Sometimes it's just starting
surrounding the artwork.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.720
And then sometimes it's going
really big and taking over an

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:14.410
entire space.

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:22.170
This is the cafe section of a
gallery space in Paris, just

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:23.430
out of Paris.

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:25.690
A wall-to-ceiling graphics--

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:26.940
can't really avoid it.

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:31.330
And then this is probably
one of my favorite

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:32.480
experiences we created.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:36.230
This is in a gallery show
in Chicago, a little

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:37.560
store called Rotofuji.

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:38.990
They have a gallery
in the shop.

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:42.920
And the show itself was about
famine and death.

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:46.170
It was called "Love the End."
My relationship was falling

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:47.270
apart at the time.

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:52.330
Really dark, Earth-ending
volcanoes, and oil rig

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:55.810
bursting into flames,
and loneliness.

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:58.690
But in the corner the gallery
over here, we built a pit.

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:03.150
It was about four feet deep and
maybe like five feet wide.

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:06.025
And we filled it with
100 of these guys.

00:14:06.025 --> 00:14:06.980
They were called Worribles.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.190
They were designed--

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:10.350
when you hug them they take
all your worries away from

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.200
you, make you feel better.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.390
And so the show that
was actually pretty

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:14.430
dark, all the work--

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:16.510
I mean, it's still kind of
playful-- but we had kids

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:17.640
jumping in this pit.

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:21.170
ANDREW BELL: This one kid in
particular was beating the

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:22.970
hell out of everyone else
that would come near

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:24.380
him with the Worribles.

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:29.670
So since then, if given the
opportunity, I think creating

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:31.770
experience rather than just
throwing your art up is

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:33.280
probably the right way to go.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.310
So I'm just going to go through
some of my-- now I'm

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:36.550
just going to throw some art
up on the screen and

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:38.320
show you some art.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.130
But you're experiencing it.

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:40.810
So, this is some of
my work on paper.

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:46.630
I've tried to go beyond just the
standard black and white

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:49.340
imagery that I was used
to doing some things.

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:52.170
I started out just trimming some
edges, making some paper

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:54.570
look old, adding some detail,
some gold paint here and

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:59.000
there, getting a little more
involved in the shading.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.962
And then after that, I
decided to take it

00:15:01.962 --> 00:15:02.760
a little bit further.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:06.180
You can't really see here--
but I'll zoom in--

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:09.260
this little guy has three
different layers of paper.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.000
So he's got the eyeball in one,
then the main drawing,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.780
then behind it there's
a bit more depth.

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.040
I extended that a bit more.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:20.390
This one has a metal needle
and like four or five

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:21.640
different layers.

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:25.510
It's kind of bright in
here and a lot of

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:26.350
these are kind of dark.

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:27.600
I apologize.

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:32.210
And this one that
includes cotton

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:36.780
stuffing, needles, thread.

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:39.650
You can see some of
the details here.

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:41.100
And I still do the black
and white drawings.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.410
I try to make them a little
more elaborate.

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:44.215
I've added a few more
shades of gray to

00:15:44.215 --> 00:15:46.700
spice them up a bit--

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:47.830
not just light gray.

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:52.290
Some cool grays, some warm
grays, some yellowish grays, a

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:55.550
few reds here and there.

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:57.340
And they've gotten a little
more complex sometimes.

00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:01.180
This is one from a show
about brothers.

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:02.730
And some people might
have seen this one.

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:08.450
This is the Android brothers
having some delicious apple.

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:10.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:11.600
ANDREW BELL: I don't know
if you can see that.

00:16:14.617 --> 00:16:17.875
It's on water-color paper to
give it a little more texture.

00:16:17.875 --> 00:16:21.100
And I think I've settled
somewhere in the middle.

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:23.410
It's got the deckled edges.

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:25.230
I gave it a little bit
of gold on the edges.

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:27.880
And then in the middle there of
the head there's a little

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:32.470
gemstone on the paper.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:33.105
This is recently.

00:16:33.105 --> 00:16:35.050
It's kind of where
I am these days.

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:43.350
All right, I want to talk a
bit about prints, or the

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:44.835
Recession Special.

00:16:44.835 --> 00:16:48.180
It's helped me survive that
period a few years ago where

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:49.600
everything was pretty rough.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.875
I started a little club where
you could pay a monthly fee

00:16:52.875 --> 00:16:54.830
and you'd get a print
every month.

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:57.920
So that was a way people for
to stay engaged with me

00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.690
without a major commitment, but
know they're going to get

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:01.950
something on a regular basis.

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:02.560
And I prints.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:06.000
Prints are fun to do, they're
fun to make, and they're a

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.420
great way to translate stuff
that is either too expensive,

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:14.579
or too big, or too crazy
to otherwise deal with.

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:18.960
There's a painting I did that's,
I think, about five

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:21.690
feet tall, over eight
feet wide.

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:24.990
Obviously, hard to hang in
your New York apartment.

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:26.155
But prints--

00:17:26.155 --> 00:17:27.960
good way to translate it.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.140
This is just a lithograph.

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:32.570
Printing gives you
so many options.

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:35.100
This is a screen print
with many colors.

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:37.040
And the great thing about screen
printing is it gives

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.380
you some texture options, too.

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:43.010
We did the main colors in flat,
and the black outlines

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:45.570
were in a high gloss,
contrast black.

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:47.240
So when you see it in person,
it really has a

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:50.060
nice feel in the hand.

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:52.360
And these are letterpress
prints.

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.900
And how they make those is
they have these blocks of

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.980
metal with the different images
on them, and they stamp

00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:58.600
them into the paper.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.250
So when you look at them and
you look at the paper, it's

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:01.030
actually indented in there.

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:02.840
The inks are impressed
in the paper.

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.910
So it really gives you a good
physical feel-- very different

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:09.311
from the flat screen
that we're used to.

00:18:09.311 --> 00:18:11.220
I still did some
digital stuff.

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:13.790
This is a digital print
of a drawing.

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:19.080
But I decided to do each
one different.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.320
This is the base one.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.180
So each member of the print
club got a different one.

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:24.670
So I'd take the base digital
print and draw on it with

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:28.210
pencil and color it to give
everyone a little different

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:29.460
experience.

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:36.660
I still love digital, because it
lets me do colorful and fun

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:37.990
things quickly and easily.

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:41.470
This is from a recent show,
opened two weeks ago in Vienna

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:44.390
called Odd Obst which
is about fruit.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:45.190
I like food.

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:47.641
I like food artwork.

00:18:47.641 --> 00:18:50.190
This is some cherries.

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:52.494
This is a fun one of toast.

00:18:52.494 --> 00:18:56.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:57.910
ANDREW BELL: And this
is probably the most

00:18:57.910 --> 00:18:59.430
popular one I've done.

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:00.010
This is called

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:03.070
"Never Look Back." [LAUGHTER]

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:05.245
ANDREW BELL: And it started just
as a digital print in a

00:19:05.245 --> 00:19:11.980
show in 2005, but it inspired a
sequel, "Never Look Back 2,"

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:17.520
and a trequal, and beyond
that a toy.

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:29.515
And prints and toys are
something that kind of go

00:19:29.515 --> 00:19:30.270
great together.

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:33.260
People don't always have room
for the toys, or they can't

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.020
afford the toys.

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:35.700
But usually there's
some wall space.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:39.990
So if I have a toy coming out, I
like to pair it with a print

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:42.780
as an option for collectors.

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:44.435
So speaking of toys.

00:19:44.435 --> 00:19:48.440
And I have "toys" in quotes
here, because I'm sure most of

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:52.810
you are familiar with adult
collectibles that are not toys

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:54.230
for adults.

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:56.576
they're not adult toys.

00:19:56.576 --> 00:19:57.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.060
ANDREW BELL: They're
toys for adults.

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.220
There's a very big difference.

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.390
And when people ask me what I
do these days, I have to be

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:03.440
very specific.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:10.810
ANDREW BELL: To me, toys that
I put out are sculptures.

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:13.780
They're short run, limited
edition sculptures.

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:16.970
And they might be made of vinyl
or plastic, but they

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:18.310
might as well be bronzed.

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:20.770
That's how I see them.

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:26.550
This whole scene started
probably in the late '90s.

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:30.540
I was working at Nickelodeon
when I first saw this stuff.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:33.430
I had a co-worker who had one
of these guys on his desk.

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:36.220
I said, hey, what's that toy
or thing on your desk.

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:38.270
And he told me, oh, it's
this toy by this

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:39.200
designer in Hong Kong.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.070
This guy on the left here is
Eric So and the guy on the

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:43.420
right is Michael Lau.

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:44.630
I was like, oh, that's cool.

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:45.170
Where did you get it?

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:46.100
He told me where he got it.

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.810
And he was like, yeah,
it was like $120.

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:49.280
What?

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.140
You paid $120 for a toy?

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:52.640
You're insane.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:55.630
So I went down to the store, and
then I think I spent $300

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:56.431
on toys that day.

00:20:56.431 --> 00:20:58.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:58.540 --> 00:20:59.930
ANDREW BELL: I had never
considered that before.

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:02.510
As an artist, I'd never
considered that you could have

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:06.260
something that wasn't a $3,000
metal sculpture or a giant

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:08.470
stone sculpture.

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:13.620
It's somewhere in between
a toy for kids and a

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.810
piece of fine art.

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:21.550
A lot of them are limited to
anywhere from 5 to 500.

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:24.910
So I immediately started
working on something.

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:26.480
I started this guy in 2004.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.910
This is my first toy,
named Grub.

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:32.320
And the toys that I'd seen up
until that point, they were

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.105
just little statues.

00:21:33.105 --> 00:21:35.400
But I wanted to make it a
little more interactive.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.080
So he could swap his faces out
depending on your mood and how

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:41.660
you were feeling that day.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:44.700
My second toy was
called Zliks.

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:46.280
And it came as a three set.

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:48.260
And I tried to carry some of
that interactivity over.

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.220
You could swap their heads out,
swap their eyeballs out.

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:51.390
There were different colors,
and you could

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:53.000
swap between a few.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.600
But this is when it really
clicked to me that I had not

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.280
wasted my four years in art
schools learning computer art.

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:01.770
Because, oh, 3-D reprinting
is now a thing.

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:04.520
It was still pretty expensive
and not very accessible when I

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:05.290
started working on this.

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:09.010
But it was when I came
full circle, I think.

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:10.970
I was like, oh, hey, I can use
what I had learned to do

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:12.600
prototyping.

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:15.310
So we did some color mockups.

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:21.130
And here's that guy,
Zliks, another set.

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:23.350
And after that was a guy
called the Giver.

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:25.385
And the idea behind this guy was
that each one would come

00:22:25.385 --> 00:22:28.470
with a gift or a present that
he would present to you.

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:32.710
And this is the Giver--

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:34.230
he has the Dumpling of Doom.

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:36.810
This is the Pestilence edition
Giver, Dumpling of Doom.

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:37.360
It's cute.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.130
It's still a little dark.

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:40.080
I think that sort of
sums up my style.

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:41.850
This was the Giver of War.

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:44.515
It's hard to see here, but the
bomb has a big F on it.

00:22:44.515 --> 00:22:47.900
So it came with an F bomb.

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:49.170
This one is called the A-Type.

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:52.120
And it was collaboration with a
store in New York called My

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:52.850
Plastic Heart.

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:54.890
It was an extrapolation
of their logo, which

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:57.170
is a plastic heart.

00:22:57.170 --> 00:23:02.250
And he was fun because I used my
computer to pre-vis how he

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:06.880
would sit and stand and if he
could hang upside down.

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:10.660
This is a recent one called
Can of Worms.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:13.205
And this is the one
that just came out

00:23:13.205 --> 00:23:14.560
maybe like a week ago.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.440
This is called the Dealmaker.

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:20.490
And he's one of the first
Japanese-style, soft vinyl

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:22.250
productions to be made the US.

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:26.080
Until now, most of it's been
done in Japan, or there's some

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.920
Hong Kong versions
of it as well.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:32.130
But that was made in California,
right here.

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:35.770
And this one is coming
up, so, spoilers.

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:39.190
This is from my company,
Dead Zebra.

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:40.710
And it's about eight
inches tall.

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:42.450
It's the chess piece
style thing.

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:43.140
His mouth opens.

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.460
You can put things
inside of it.

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:48.610
And I'm excited about this
because it also comes with a

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:49.590
pair of shoes.

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:54.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:57.170
ANDREW BELL: When I go to do
something, if I'm in my house

00:23:57.170 --> 00:24:00.900
and I need like a new hat or a
new table or a new bookshelf,

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:02.470
instead of saying, I'm going
to go to Ikea, I

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:04.290
say, can I make one?

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:05.680
Can I go get one made?

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:09.360
So I've always wanted to
my own kind of shoes.

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:13.170
But I usually wear Onitsuka
Tigers, which is what this is.

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:14.750
So one day I was like, I need
a new pair of shoes.

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:16.360
I should see if I
can hook up with

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.590
them and work on something.

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:21.700
And that will be coming
out this summer.

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:23.550
So yeah, working with other
companies is always fun.

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:26.950
Sometimes they have a platform
that they've already designed

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:29.555
that they give to you to see
what you can do with.

00:24:29.555 --> 00:24:32.130
This is a Dunny from Kidrobot.

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:33.070
It's been around for awhile.

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:35.880
It's one of the original
popular collectibles.

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.150
And sometimes you have
less to work with.

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:39.100
This is pretty basic,
but tried to

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:42.290
translate my art to it.

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:45.620
And then other times, I get to
be in control of the platform,

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:46.610
which is nice.

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:47.810
I think you guys are
familiar with this.

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:48.840
We'll come back to
some Androids.

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:51.640
I've got plenty to show
you in a few minutes.

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:53.550
But this is from series one,
one of the original ones.

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:55.295
And this is more recent,
Sir Knightly Bild.

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:03.130
I still do some sculptures,
actual sculptures, one-off

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:04.610
editions, two or
three editions.

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:10.010
This is called "Heart Attack."
It's a heart just running in a

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:11.210
blood splat.

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:12.610
I'm still obsessed with food.

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:15.670
This was some zombie
candy corn.

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:17.010
I did a series of three
of four of these.

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:18.640
And they came with little
magnets in their feet, so you

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:19.945
could put them on different
stands or

00:25:19.945 --> 00:25:21.290
stick them on things.

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:25.400
And then last year, I followed
that up with a "KillKat," evil

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:31.720
wafers, sort of Siamese
twin monsters.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.240
I do some healthy food, too.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:41.290
Some apples, some evil, apples,
some sad apples.

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:44.300
And some more figurative
stuff.

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:47.490
It's kind of hard to see this
because they're dark.

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:51.550
But this was a small baby
creature in a mouse trap.

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:53.595
It's kind of strange,
I suppose.

00:25:53.595 --> 00:25:58.240
Now that I say it out loud, that
sounds kind of horrible.

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.730
But even with the sculptures,
I try to make it where it's

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:02.540
something that's still
practical.

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:04.980
This was a wall-hanging unit.

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:05.950
It came with this guy.

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:09.310
But I did another one that
came with nothing, so you

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:11.590
could put your own stuff
inside of it,

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:13.190
if you wanted to.

00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:17.020
And this guy, you could take his
head out and put a cone of

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:18.870
incense in his head and
then when lit it up.

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:21.298
And he would smoke
out of his eyes.

00:26:21.298 --> 00:26:25.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:26.750
ANDREW BELL: And then somewhere
in between the

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:30.760
sculpture and the toy
is a resin edition.

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:34.920
So you can do a design and then
run 30, 40, 100 of them.

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:38.070
It's not quite toy production,
it's not quite individual hand

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:38.400
production.

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.990
But I like to hand finish them,
make each one a little

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:43.770
different, but some
weather on them.

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:47.140
These are called "Glob
in a Box."

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:49.575
And with the resin production,
this is called "The Watcher."

00:26:49.575 --> 00:26:50.480
I did this for show.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.490
It's about this big.

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:52.860
It's a pretty good one.

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:55.920
And I took that and I had
a few extras made

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:56.910
of the blank resin.

00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:59.480
So it's been transformed into
various things, including this

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:05.220
bat and an octopus with an egg
in his mouth for a show.

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:06.960
This is based off another
artist's character called

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.210
Scary Girl.

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:14.640
And this guy turned into this.

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:18.260
So there's sort of a subset of
the toy and collectible world,

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:19.530
do it yourself.

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:21.760
Pretty popular.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:26.150
Sometimes you get a figure
and you just paint on

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:26.750
it or draw on it.

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:29.420
And other times you get
something that's kind of

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:30.840
already set in what
it looks like.

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.850
This is called Misfortune
Cat from [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:38.840
So I took that guy, I sculpted
on top of him, hollowed out

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:44.360
his belly, added a skull,
and ended up with this.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:47.570
And then sometimes they give
you some things like this.

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:48.420
It's a station wagon.

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:51.270
They had a show of custom
station wagons, which is a

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:53.315
challenge to me because
I draw monsters.

00:27:53.315 --> 00:27:55.840
I don't draw stationed wagons.

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.420
So I strapped a giant
monster to the roof.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:06.090
You might recognize
this guy, Stitch.

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:10.480
So I like reimagine things as
much as possible instead of

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.240
just slapping artwork
on something.

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:15.900
So I dismantled poor little
Stitch here and reassembled

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.670
him into two characters
called Mile and Ditch.

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:24.300
So that's some of my artwork.

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.260
I hope you will join me in
looking at your world a little

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:29.600
differently, maybe deconstruct
some things, maybe approach

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:34.690
your food with caution, or
sympathy, depending on how you

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:36.460
feel that day.

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:38.770
I'm going to show you guys some
Android stuff, if you're

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:40.230
interested.

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:41.590
Anyone?

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:42.530
[LAUGHS]

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:45.820
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:47.400
ANDREW BELL: All right, how many
of you guys have Android

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.040
collectibles?

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:49.600
[LAUGHS]

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.320
That's pretty much everybody.

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:51.570
I guess you wouldn't be
here otherwise, right?

00:28:55.630 --> 00:29:00.990
So a few years back, I got the
opportunity to start working

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:01.690
on these guys.

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:05.910
If you'd like to
hear about it.

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:08.370
Some of our early prototype
testing design.

00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:11.250
So how it came about is actually
through comics,

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:12.722
strangely enough.

00:29:12.722 --> 00:29:15.390
My time a Comic-Con was
also not wasted.

00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:19.990
I got to meet an artist at the
small press table doing weird

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:21.420
little comics on the
side who also

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:22.850
happened to be a developer.

00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:24.490
And he happened to develop
for a little

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:25.490
company called Danger.

00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:27.810
I don't know if you guys have
ever heard of Danger, which

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:33.170
Andy Rubin ran, which later
started Android, and the rest

00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:34.400
is history.

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.340
But my contact with this guy
was through Comic-Con.

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:42.040
And our subsequent friendship
led to him calling me up one

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.450
day and saying, oh, hey, we've
got this project at Google.

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:48.450
Maybe we can do some promotional
stuff for it.

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:49.290
You make toys--

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:50.980
got any ideas?

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:53.080
I said, yeah, I've
got some ideas.

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:54.340
See what we can do.

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:58.280
So I started working on this,
a little mini figure here.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:00.010
This is some of the
early concepts.

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:01.450
Top one's basically what
we ended up with.

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:04.090
We were trying to figure out
what to do with the legs.

00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:05.836
As you know, the Android figure
itself would probably

00:30:05.836 --> 00:30:10.630
just topple over if it was
just cylindrical legs.

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:12.390
We tried to maybe make him
short, give him a lower center

00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:14.570
of gravity, make him round,
maybe make them triangular.

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:19.440
But the top one felt the most
natural, so we went with that.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:23.940
These are some of the early
designs from series one.

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:26.100
Some of them kind of
made it through.

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:27.880
If you're familiar with series
one, you can see what they

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.570
turned into.

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:32.430
My favorite one on the
top right there was

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:35.280
rejected quite quickly.

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:36.340
This was my design.

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:39.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:42.100
ANDREW BELL: I thought
it was awesome.

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:45.380
But someone in the Google legal
department had other

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:46.920
issues with it.

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:48.580
I don't know why.

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.616
I think it should
still be made.

00:30:50.616 --> 00:30:55.080
So yeah, series one, it was
mostly designed by myself.

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:57.220
And it was originally just
going to be an internal

00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:00.210
promotional giveaway situation,
some goodies.

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:02.230
But I said, hey, you
know what, there's

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:03.350
this whole toy world.

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:04.390
People might be into this.

00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:06.140
People might be interested
in this.

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:08.840
Can I make a few more and
maybe sell them to them?

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.606
And they said, well, whatever.

00:31:10.606 --> 00:31:12.230
[LAUGHS]

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:13.680
All right, there was some
legal stuff in there.

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:15.930
But theoretically, that's
what I heard.

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:16.710
Whatever.

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:18.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:19.580
ANDREW BELL: Do what you want.

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:21.790
It's fine.

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:22.750
So we made a few more.

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:23.970
And I had no idea--

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:28.630
it's a toy based on a brand new
mobile operating system

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:30.920
that has a mascot.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.910
I thought either I was going to
be stuck with a truckload

00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:35.190
of little green figures or
it would do really well.

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:38.500
And thankfully, it has done
really well and Android is

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:39.770
still around.

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:41.640
These are some of the
early designs.

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:42.550
This is CopperBot.

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:44.480
He had a metal finish.

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:47.870
But the original designs were
all relatively simple,

00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:50.110
straightforward.

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:51.770
Series two-- after
that, we got a

00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:54.900
few more people involved.

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.590
We did some other materials.

00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:57.710
So this is Greeneon.

00:31:57.710 --> 00:31:59.150
He was a harder plastic.

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:01.270
But he was clear, so you
could put stuff in him.

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:04.460
And you guys have probably
seen this guy, Noogler.

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:07.790
He was the first Android mini
with an accessory slash

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:11.180
different head, the
working beanie.

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:13.040
And this was designed
by a fellow

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.325
Googler called Jeff Yaksick.

00:32:14.325 --> 00:32:15.970
He was on the Android team.

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:18.770
And this one by Gary
Ham called Cupcake.

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:20.235
He actually smells
like a cupcake.

00:32:20.235 --> 00:32:23.120
So we're experimenting with
stuff like that as well.

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:24.750
And series three, we
continued that.

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:28.020
I invited a few more artists to
work on different series.

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:33.040
And we changed the arm design
from a standard little peg to

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:38.300
a round ball and cup design,
which gives it a little more

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:41.970
freedom, a little
more expression.

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:43.570
This is by my friend
Kelly Denato.

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:45.040
She's done some great artwork.

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:47.870
It's called Pandroid,
with the pan flute.

00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:50.680
And my friend Sket, the
8 Ball Hustler.

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:52.710
I think this was the first
one with a hat--

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:54.920
not the last.

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.420
And then this was one
from series three.

00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:58.870
They all came with a little
mini one inside.

00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:01.530
And one this was a favorite
from series three by Matt.

00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:03.120
It came with a little ball.

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.990
So you could pull his head off
and put the ball in and shake

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:09.290
it like a real spray can.

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:12.250
And beyond the artist series,
we do quite a few for Google

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:13.730
internal departments
and promotions.

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:14.940
This is for analytics.

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:16.440
I think the analysts ones,
they're really simple, but

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:18.290
they're some of my
favorite designs.

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:19.040
This is the first one.

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.700
And then, of course, they
upgraded their interface, so

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:23.790
this is a more recent one.

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:27.000
And this one has proven
to be very popular.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.570
They gave it away at
South by Southwest.

00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:30.280
It's really simple.

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:30.920
It's really basic.

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.350
But people just really
love it.

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:36.240
It's Schemer from the
Schemer Project.

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:40.390
This is for the mobile
ad unit--

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:42.050
Mobley the Ad Man.

00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:46.500
Came with a little fedora and
a little Nexus phone.

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:50.065
And this, I've just been
informed, you can only win if

00:33:50.065 --> 00:33:51.865
you do good work
on the UX team.

00:33:51.865 --> 00:33:52.940
[LAUGHS]

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:55.220
A lot of the other ones are
given away at events or for

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:56.140
departmental things.

00:33:56.140 --> 00:34:00.200
But this one seems allusive.

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:03.304
Anyone go into I/O?

00:34:03.304 --> 00:34:05.160
Well, you might be get
one of these guys.

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:06.410
This is the I/O Tester.

00:34:10.829 --> 00:34:14.490
He's a cross between a crash
test dummy and a developer.

00:34:14.490 --> 00:34:17.239
Oh, they're the same
thing, right?

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:19.560
So he comes with little
safety goggles and a

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:22.650
fade in the I/O colors.

00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:24.090
Hopefully it'll be enough
to go around.

00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:25.969
And if we've got some
coming here, too.

00:34:32.596 --> 00:34:33.080
Aw!

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:36.075
What's up next Android minis?

00:34:36.075 --> 00:34:37.325
I brought some samples.

00:34:40.418 --> 00:34:42.889
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:44.159
ANDREW BELL: So people really
like the clear ones.

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:45.389
They like they can take
their heads off.

00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:47.570
They like they can put
stuff inside of them.

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:49.624
And so this is the next
set coming out.

00:34:49.624 --> 00:34:51.120
It's called the rainbow
series.

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:53.760
And it comes in this awesome
box, which is

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:54.770
also a display case.

00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:56.159
It flips open.

00:34:56.159 --> 00:35:00.800
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:01.530
ANDREW BELL: And [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:03.410
It's got one sparkly.

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:04.300
It's got sparkles.

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:05.990
We haven't embedded sparkles
in one before,

00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:07.240
so that was a first.

00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:15.600
And then, coming up later this
year, is series four.

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:19.410
It'll be coming out probably
late summer, early fall.

00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:22.990
Looking at August, September
probably.

00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:24.730
And now I believe I'm going
to get grilled with some

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:28.685
questions from the audience
and from online.

00:35:28.685 --> 00:35:31.110
AUDIENCE: All right, let's
give it up for Andrew.

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:38.390
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:39.960
AUDIENCE: Say your name
and your question.

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:40.950
AUDIENCE: My name is Alex.

00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:41.870
I worked here at Google.

00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:44.080
And I'm a big fan
of your toys.

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.700
And one thing I discovered when
I bought one on eBay was

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:48.240
that it was a knockoff.

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:51.950
And I was wondering, how do you
guys approach knockoffs?

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:54.400
How do you prevent them
from happening?

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:57.000
And what's your take on that?

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.880
ANDREW BELL: It's hard.

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:02.470
In some cases, it's
impossible.

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:03.190
AUDIENCE: Just don't buy them.

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:04.410
ANDREW BELL: What's that?

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:04.890
Just don't by them?

00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:05.870
Well, that's was part of it.

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:09.500
I mean, people do buy them.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:12.345
Series one came out and was
popular, and series two came

00:36:12.345 --> 00:36:13.250
out and was popular.

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:16.830
And naturally, some factories
saw that and were like, hey,

00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:18.430
let's just make some of those.

00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:21.170
So pretty soon there were some
really crappy copies out on

00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:22.890
the market.

00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:26.070
One way we helped prevent it is
I had to switch factories.

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:28.700
That factory you saw in the
video was a brand new factory,

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:30.100
a brand new building we had.

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:33.040
Because series two, there were
some extras, some dubious

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.810
quality ones that were slipping
out the back door

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:37.960
from the factory that I was
contracted to earlier.

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:40.720
Now I have a tightly controlled
supply chain where

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.630
it's just me and the guy
that runs the factory.

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:45.190
And we keep the designs down.

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:47.420
And then there's the occasional
cease and desist.

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:50.860
And people in Hong Kong and
China tend to ignore those.

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:53.790
Or light fires with them.

00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:55.760
Luckily, I have a representative
over there who

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.070
tries to stay on top of that.

00:36:57.070 --> 00:37:01.840
But I think the best way to
combat it is to make better,

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:04.660
higher quality, and
keep innovating.

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:06.230
Like series three, we added
the ball joint arms.

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:07.360
I haven't seen anyone
copy that.

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.020
It's too expensive,
not worth it.

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:12.450
The paint quality we have on the
newer ones, you can't copy

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:15.790
it for the price that they
want for the fake ones.

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:19.750
So that's probably best way,
is just to outdo them.

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:20.230
Thanks.

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:21.920
AUDIENCE: Bringing in other
artists-- how did that start?

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:23.520
Was it just like, hey,
I'm running up ideas.

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:24.500
Can someone help me out?

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:27.270
Or were you working with some
other artists that you thought

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:28.430
could contribute?

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:31.900
ANDREW BELL: Well, the whole
collectible scene, the toy

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:34.340
scene, is based off of that--
different artists working on

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:36.110
different platforms and
working together.

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:39.970
So while series one was mostly
me, just proof of concept,

00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:41.840
series two, I wanted to get
some people from Google

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:44.100
involved, use some
of their designs.

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:47.020
And then series three was more
getting other artists that I

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:48.790
know and other friends
that I have.

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:53.480
And it's finding people whose
artwork and style would work

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:55.170
well with the Android
figure itself.

00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:58.140
Not everyone can design
for a limited palette

00:37:58.140 --> 00:37:59.390
or a limited size.

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:04.780
AUDIENCE: This one from Mike
L. in Louisville, Kentucky.

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:06.550
So there's Cupcake--

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:09.120
why were there no other
designs [INAUDIBLE]?

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.810
ANDREW BELL: After that?

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:11.840
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:12.930
ANDREW BELL: There are plans.

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:14.810
It has been discussed
over the years--

00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:17.230
you keep making fun version
names, and we'll

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:18.390
keep working on plans.

00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:20.010
So hopefully in the next couple

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:21.260
years we'll see something.

00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:25.470
AUDIENCE: When you first decided
you wanted to start

00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:27.780
making toys, were you working
with somebody else who had

00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:29.315
already made them, or did you
figure out the process?

00:38:29.315 --> 00:38:30.680
Because that looked
really involved.

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:32.320
I didn't realize how
involved it was.

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:35.820
ANDREW BELL: Yeah, it took
awhile to learn.

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:40.340
My first idea was just, I'm
going to make a toy.

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:42.910
I didn't let myself get
discouraged when I realize how

00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:44.210
impossible that was.

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:47.380
I was going to toy conventions--
there's the toy

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:48.650
fair every year that's
been going on for

00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:50.040
years in New York--

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:52.140
going to toy stores--

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:54.380
the guy who runs the shop in New
York that has those toys

00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:56.510
that I first saw-- say, hey,
where do you get your stuff?

00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:58.090
Who makes these things?

00:38:58.090 --> 00:38:59.940
And eventually, I managed to
find some connections to some

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:01.500
people that were more familiar
with the process.

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:03.180
And they helped me through
the first one.

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:07.102
And then after, tried to do most
of it myself after that.

00:39:07.102 --> 00:39:09.880
And now, having been at the
factory and intimately

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:13.830
familiar the process, it makes
it easier to design toys

00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:16.010
knowing the technical
limitations and how things

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:18.040
actually get made.

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:19.880
It was research, talking
to people, schmoozing.

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:25.070
I'm not good at it, but I was
persistent, so it worked.

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:26.800
AUDIENCE: All right, our next
question from the Dori and the

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:30.360
public forums was from JF
Isla, in Riverside.

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.766
Will you ever consider letting
fans submit designs for one of

00:39:32.766 --> 00:39:34.690
your series, because I have
a couple in mind?

00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:35.920
Wink, wink.

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:36.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:37.960
ANDREW BELL: A lot of people
have a lot of good ideas.

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:41.390
I don't know.

00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:42.480
Fan sourcing is difficult.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:45.220
Because a lot of times you get
a lot of things like Pokemon

00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:46.790
or Ultraman.

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:48.600
There's some really cute
designs, some really stuff.

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:51.680
But a lot of it's not as fun
and creative as it could be

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:54.850
and could never get made
for copyright reasons.

00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:57.010
But I think it'd be fun to have
a contest where we do

00:39:57.010 --> 00:39:57.600
some fan stuff.

00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:00.280
I'd certainly like to get more
Google people involved in

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:02.250
future series.

00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:05.750
Maybe we'll have an internal
company contest.

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:07.400
AUDIENCE: Get working.

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:08.920
ANDREW BELL: Get some of those
creative minds going.

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:09.922
AUDIENCE: We've got
some artists here.

00:40:09.922 --> 00:40:10.304
ANDREW BELL: Yeah.

00:40:10.304 --> 00:40:13.820
Yeah, I think that
would be fun.

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:16.520
AUDIENCE: A bunch of people on
the public G+ are asking if,

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:18.330
not the whole presentation,
because it kind of shows the

00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:20.520
new design, but the beginning
of the presentation is going

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:23.040
to be put online so they can--

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:24.150
on the public G+?

00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:26.290
ANDREW BELL: Yeah, I think most
the stuff up until the

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:28.876
secret stuff, we'll
have it up there.

00:40:28.876 --> 00:40:29.812
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:40:29.812 --> 00:40:33.415
AUDIENCE: All right, this one
is from our Googler Matt.

00:40:33.415 --> 00:40:35.997
Do you have any fun stories
behind any of

00:40:35.997 --> 00:40:37.247
your Android designs?

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:43.930
ANDREW BELL: Not too funny.

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:45.280
Not the ones I can talk
about, at least.

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:52.360
Some of the fun ones are the
ones that get canned, like the

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:55.420
Blue Screen of Death one.

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:59.480
But nothing too crazy.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:02.280
AUDIENCE: So the next question
is from myself.

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.950
Did you think it would sell
beyond series one when you

00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:05.270
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:07.000
I think partially answered
[INAUDIBLE].

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.610
ANDREW BELL: Yeah, I don't think
anyone here or myself

00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:14.270
knew if people would want a
phone mascot as a collectible

00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:17.560
or to spend money on something
that is essentially a

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:19.600
marketing tool, when
you think about it.

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:22.920
But yeah, I had no idea it would
as popular, as big, or

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.550
go on as long as it has.

00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:25.330
I'm happy for it.

00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:27.360
And I'd like to keep doing it.

00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:32.570
AUDIENCE: All right, another
question, from Yani G. And I'm

00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:36.000
sorry, I'm only going to go
there, Yani, if you're here.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.060
There's been some frustration
from the collector's community

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:41.500
recently about the recent
designs being very similar to

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:45.370
each other, all differing by the
lettering or the scrolls.

00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:46.715
What is your take on this?

00:41:46.715 --> 00:41:50.070
ANDREW BELL: He's referring
to one specific.

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:52.590
He's referring to the Chinese
Near Year edition, where it

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:54.370
came with a little scroll.

00:41:54.370 --> 00:41:57.780
Each one had a different printed
saying on it, seven

00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:00.070
different ones so you didn't
know which one you would get.

00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:02.990
I think it's just part
of collecting.

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:06.060
In one way, from a technical
financial standpoint, you need

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:08.900
to make variations of things
to keep the cost of the

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:10.370
crazier ones down.

00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:14.810
Now, for every plain blue are
plain green Android, I can

00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:17.220
make that crazy one that
had 100 prints on it.

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:19.390
Because it averages it out.

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:23.040
But I understand this can be
frustrating for completists to

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:25.350
find something, or when things
are similar to each other.

00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:29.310
But I think it's part
of the game.

00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:31.030
AUDIENCE: This one
is from external.

00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:33.610
Jonathan, from Brooklyn.

00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:35.495
I think you answered it.

00:42:35.495 --> 00:42:38.030
Would you consider doing a
five inch or eight inch?

00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:38.800
ANDREW BELL: Yeah, definitely.

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:39.480
Yes.

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:41.880
Yes, I would consider it.

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:43.820
I think that ones more
about 10 inches.

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:45.130
Is that right?

00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:46.970
AUDIENCE: Also, a part of this
question is, do you also to do

00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:48.770
a DIY, do-it-yourself,
Android?

00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:50.450
ANDREW BELL: Yeah, have plans
for a do-it-yourself large

00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:51.180
version, too.

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:54.363
So I expect to see some pretty
crazy electronic versions of

00:42:54.363 --> 00:42:57.370
that, because there's more room
to fit more Servos and

00:42:57.370 --> 00:42:57.860
things inside.

00:42:57.860 --> 00:42:59.110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:02.900
ANDREW BELL: Well, we're
starting with the green and

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:03.300
the outline.

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:07.356
And then hopefully we'll be able
to maybe translate some

00:43:07.356 --> 00:43:09.820
of the existing designs onto
the bigger platform.

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:11.790
Printing gets harder
at that scale.

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:13.650
Printing's actually easier
the small you get.

00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:14.620
So we'll see.

00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:16.374
Maybe some of the
simpler ones.

00:43:16.374 --> 00:43:17.270
AUDIENCE: Makes sense.

00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:18.850
All right, just a few
more questions here.

00:43:18.850 --> 00:43:20.980
From Alex A., here at Google--

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:24.220
how hard is it to narrow down
which designs you end up using

00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:26.130
for each series?

00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:28.030
ANDREW BELL: As you saw on that
whole chart of the series

00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:29.860
three ones, it's tough
to decide.

00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:34.250
Sometimes I decide through those
criteria of copyright

00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:36.250
possibility, technical things.

00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:38.120
And then other times, it's
just a gut feeling, like

00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:39.170
what's going to work
well with other

00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:40.420
designs that I've gotten.

00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:42.130
Or has this artist
had like three

00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:43.510
designs in the last series?

00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:46.340
So there's no real formula, just
how it feels and how it

00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:47.590
feels in context.

00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:53.890
AUDIENCE: I think this has also
been answered from Alex.

00:43:53.890 --> 00:43:54.530
The [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:56.380
bigger things for the
future Androids.

00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:58.782
And I think you showed us what.

00:43:58.782 --> 00:43:59.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.840
AUDIENCE: So he's thinking
ahead, obviously.

00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:02.950
ANDREW BELL: We're always
working on stuff.

00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:03.780
AUDIENCE: Good questions,
though.

00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:05.030
Good questions.

00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:11.500
So do you know it takes three
to six months for a single

00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:15.090
project to come alive, these
figurines, from the design

00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:19.070
phase, and he goes, working
with manufacturing and

00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:19.890
everything.

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:23.150
And he works with multiple
projects at the same time.

00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:27.120
I contacted him back in January
of this year and said,

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:27.400
hey, Andrew.

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:30.080
Do you want to come
and have a talk?

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.930
A bunch of people would
love to have you.

00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:34.380
Without hesitation, he said,
yes, I'll do it.

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:36.796
So I applaud his loyalty
and commitment.

00:44:36.796 --> 00:44:42.860
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:43.870
ANDREW BELL: He promised
me free lunch.

00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:45.274
That's why I showed up.

00:44:45.274 --> 00:44:47.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:48.870
AUDIENCE: You could
come every month.

00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:57.830
Andrew is a pretty big fan of,
obviously, art and everything.

00:44:57.830 --> 00:45:00.480
And he also appreciates
our doodle.

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:04.970
I've seen him treating nice
doodles and what we create.

00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:07.790
So we got something really
simple from our Doodle team.

00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:08.180
[INAUDIBLE].

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:11.016
ANDREW BELL: Oh, awesome.

00:45:11.016 --> 00:45:12.450
Thank you.

00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:14.840
AUDIENCE: So you could open
it up if you would like.

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:15.920
ANDREW BELL: I'm not
going to wait.

00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:19.400
I was never good at that.

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:20.630
Oh, that's awesome.

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:22.610
AUDIENCE: So this is an artist's
proof from our

00:45:22.610 --> 00:45:23.260
Doodler [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:23.980
ANDREW BELL: Oh, cool.

00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:24.550
That's great.

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:26.610
Done in the Haring style.

00:45:26.610 --> 00:45:27.220
That's awesome.

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:27.910
Thank you very much.

00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:28.510
AUDIENCE: You're welcome.

00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:29.710
We hope you like it.

00:45:29.710 --> 00:45:34.102
[APPLAUSE]
