00:00:14.187 --> 00:00:16.270
WILLIAM FISHER: Dramatic
works are almost as close

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.640
to the heart of copyright
law as literary works.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.960
The premier example of a dramatic
work is, of course, a play.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.470
As you might expect, you may not
reproduce the script of a play

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.870
without the permission of the
owner of the copyright in it.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:35.080
Nor may you publicly perform the
play without the owner's permission.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.460
This rule is not always honored,
but the rule itself is clear enough.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.140
Choreography is a much more
recent addition to the catalog.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.640
One of the reasons for
its late arrival is

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.200
that the particular dances
whose status was considered

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.510
in some of the early
litigated cases happened

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.570
to offend the judges
making those decisions.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.890
For example, in the Dane case, which was
decided by the New York Supreme Court

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.950
in 1963, the work at issue
was a mock strip tease

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.300
that the plaintiff
developed and then performed

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.870
during an audition
for the musical Gypsy.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:26.160
The court refused to extend copyright
protection to this routine, reasoning,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.010
quote, "the words dramatic or
dramatico-musical composition

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.440
as used in the statute must be held
to include only those representations

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.290
and exhibitions which tend at least
to promote the progress of science

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.210
and the useful arts.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.120
Where a performance contains nothing of
literary dramatic or musical character

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.010
which is calculated to elevate,
cultivate, inform, or improve

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.230
the moral or intellectual
natures of the audience,

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.080
it does not tend to promote the
progress of science or the useful arts.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.570
Thus, not everything put on stage
can be subject to copyright.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.520
While the plaintiff's performance was no
doubt amusing and entertaining to many,

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.380
it does not fall within
the purview of the statute

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.110
as a production tending to
promote the progress of science

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.460
and the useful arts."

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.910
Recall our discussion
in Lecture Number One

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.660
of the principle of aesthetic
neutrality, which is commonly

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.770
traced in the 1903 Bleistein case.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.660
The passage I just read is
one of the many examples

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.560
of judges ignoring that
ostensible principle altogether.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.370
The unfortunate effect
of such cases is that

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.790
some famous and deserving choreographers
were left out in the cold.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.670
For example, Agnes de
Mille choreographed

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.910
Oklahoma, which was--
and deserved to be--

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.900
one of the most popular
musicals of all time.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.110
Her dances-- in particular,
the dream ballet--

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.770
contributed importantly
to the plot of the play.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:58.610
She was paid a modest contract price
by the producers, reportedly $15,000.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.140
However, unlike Rogers
and Hammerstein, who

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.010
composed the musical score
for the play, de Mille

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.610
received no royalties
when it was produced,

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.390
because her choreography, unlike
their musical compositions,

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.250
enjoyed no copyright protection.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.850
The gap in the law-- the absence
of protection for choreography--

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.820
was filled as part of
a comprehensive 1976

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.680
reform, which became
effective the start of 1978.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.860
The result is that today, choreographers
enjoy the same copyright protection

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.470
as do playwrights.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.360
Unfortunately, it's not always
clear what constitutes choreography.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.700
What about figure skating
routines, for example?

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.770
The statute itself does
not define the term.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.060
The Copyright Office has
developed its own definition,

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.500
which is set forth on your screen.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.950
"Choreography is the
composition and arrangement

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.110
of dance movements and patterns, usually
intended to be accompanied by music.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.260
As distinct from choreography, pantomime
is the act of imitating or acting

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.220
out situations, characters,
or other events.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.750
To be protected by copyright, pantomimes
and choreography need not tell a story

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.290
or be presented before an audience."

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.670
Courts, when construing
the copyright statute,

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.810
are not bound by this
administrative decision.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.800
But they tend to give it weight.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.800
As dance and performance art
continue to evolve in the future,

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.940
tricky questions concerning
the scope of this definition

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.300
are likely to arise with
increased frequency.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.680
In the United States,
choreographers face one more hurdle

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.900
if they are to secure copyright
protection for their works.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.520
They have to capture their
routines in some stable medium.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.660
As you can see from the
language of section 102a,

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.170
copyright in the United
States extends only

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.850
to works that are, quote, "fixed in
a tangible medium of expression,"

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.310
unquote.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.930
This so-called fixation
requirement is peculiar to the US.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.920
Most countries have no such rule.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.700
So what does fixation mean?

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.190
The term is defined in Section 101.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:14.120
"A work is fixed in a tangible medium
when its embodiment in a copy or phono

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.830
record by or under the
authority of the author

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.970
is sufficiently permanent or stable
to permit it to be perceived,

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.300
reproduced, or otherwise
communicated for a period of more

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.100
than transitory duration.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.360
A work consisting of sounds, images,
or both that are being transmitted

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.470
is fixed for the purposes of this
title if a fixation of the work

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.730
is being made simultaneously
with this transmission."

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.670
The overwhelming majority
of works for which authors

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:49.340
might seek copyright protection
easily satisfy this standard.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.950
Novelists typically
write their novels down.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.420
Photographers capture their images
in negatives, prints, digital files,

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.250
and so forth.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.390
However, on occasion,
potentially copyrightable works

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.020
fail to qualify for protection
because their creators neglect

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.940
this requirement.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:12.500
So, for example, if a jazz musician
in a live, unrecorded performance

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.710
improvises in an original way on a
classic public domain composition,

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.890
that musician will get no copyright
protection in his innovation.

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.760
As a matter, this means that
a member of the audience,

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.380
after hearing the performance, is
free to perform or record it himself

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.380
without fear of copyright liability.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.470
Here's a hypothetical
case that may suggest

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.480
the scope of the fixation requirement.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.460
A mandala is a highly-detailed
painting typically made out

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.520
of fine-grained colored sand
by Buddhist monks or priests.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.990
Mandalas represent the dwelling
spaces of tantric deities.

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.560
Most are elaborate, and
require a long time to create,

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.750
but they don't last long.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.960
If they're jostled, they disappear.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.150
More importantly, it's conventional,
after completing a mandala,

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:11.650
to undo it by pouring the sand into
a body of water, often a river.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.730
Among other things, this custom
emphasizes the impermanence

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:19.940
of possessions and the importance
of not being too attached to them.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.380
Traditionally, mandalas
were created and dissolved

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.300
in private religious ceremonies.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.280
Recently, however, the Dalai
Lama has encouraged monks

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:33.560
to create them in public, in part
to educate people about the culture.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:38.320
Some have been created,
briefly, in the United States.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.230
In the unlikely event that
a creator of a mandala

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:46.570
sought copyright protection in it, would
he trip over the fixation requirement?

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.360
In other words, would he lose
because this work was not

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.580
fixed in a tangible
medium of expression?

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.430
Probably not.

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:57.310
A mandala is not fixed
in the ordinary sense,

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:01.450
but it would seem to qualify
under the statutory definition.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:05.250
Its embodiment in sand is,
quote, "sufficiently stable

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.820
to permit it to be
perceived or reproduced

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:12.160
for a period of more than transitory
duration," as is evidenced

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.950
by the existence of the
photo in front of you.

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:18.050
Parenthetically, the
monk might trip over

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:22.110
a separate requirement for copyright--
namely, the originality requirement

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:24.880
discussed in Lecture Number One.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.370
The reason is that the mandalas
created by monks typically replicate

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:30.870
traditional designs.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:36.440
But the fixation requirement
would probably not be a problem.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.860
Returning, then, to the topic at hand.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:42.610
The primary form of creative
work that with some frequency

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:47.840
does run afoul of the fixation
requirement is choreography.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.760
The reason is that
choreographers commonly

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.950
fail to write down their innovations.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:56.370
In part, this is because it
used to be difficult to do so.

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:59.400
Dance notation has
existed for a long time,

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.070
but it's cumbersome and incomplete.

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:06.650
Nowadays, it's easier to
fix a choreographic work.

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:09.890
The standard method is
to videotape a rehearsal.

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:13.580
Nevertheless, some
choreographers still forget this.

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.935
In the United States, the result is
that they forfeit copyright protection.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.670
Stepping back from this example.

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:26.480
What underlies the fixation
requirement in general?

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.970
There are two standard answers.

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:30.780
But neither is particularly persuasive.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.350
The first answer is that the language
of the constitutional provision that,

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:37.300
in the United States,
underlies copyright law,

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:40.870
limits its scope to, quote, "writings."

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:46.150
An ephemeral work, it is sometimes
said, does not qualify as a writing.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:50.430
In light of how broadly the term
writing is construed in other contexts--

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:54.690
to incorporate, as we've seen,
software and photos, for example--

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:58.940
this textual argument seems weak.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:03.080
The second explanation is that
there's an important policy underlying

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:09.200
the requirement of fixation-- namely,
that it serves a evidentiary function.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:13.580
Supposedly, it forces authors and
artists to write down their works

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:17.110
and the result is to provide judges
and juries who are called upon

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:20.830
to resolve subsequent disputes
good information concerning

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:22.765
what exactly those works contained.

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:27.900
This argument is a branch
of a policy argument

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.610
one finds in many fields of the law.

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:35.970
The basic idea is that formalities
have important social functions.

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:38.210
So, for example, the rule
found in many jurisdictions

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:41.910
that a will indicating who gets
your property on your death

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:46.130
must be written down and signed
by two disinterested witnesses

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:49.020
serves to caution people concerning
the importance of what they're

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:54.160
doing when they create wills, channels
their behavior into standard forms that

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:59.630
are more easily implemented, and,
again, provides good evidence concerning

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:02.540
what they intended.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:06.830
The conventional justification of the
fixation requirement in copyright law

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:12.450
fits easily into this
family of policy arguments.

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:15.100
That conventional
justification is also, however,

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:19.330
vulnerable to the
standard retort-- namely,

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:22.430
that formalities are largely
ineffective if people

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:26.970
are unaware of them, which tends
to happen when people are not,

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:29.660
quote, "repeat players."

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:33.300
If many artists-- and many
choreographers in particular--

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.050
are unaware the fixation
requirement, it's

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:41.860
unlikely to have a socially
beneficial disciplining effect.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:45.552
A further indication that the
fixation requirement is unnecessary

00:11:45.552 --> 00:11:48.010
can be gleaned from the fact
that most countries apparently

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:49.641
get along just fine without it.

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:56.420
So that's enough for now on
literary and dramatic works.
