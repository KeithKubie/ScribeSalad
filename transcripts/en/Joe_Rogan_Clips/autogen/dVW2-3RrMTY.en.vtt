swims to the light it finds more food
 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.830
swims to the light it finds more food
there so the fish then learns to be

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840
there so the fish then learns to be
 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.679
there so the fish then learns to be
tropic to move towards the light and

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689
tropic to move towards the light and
 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.790

there's totalitarian society
no-no-no so here's the point no yes so

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:25.050
no-no-no so here's the point no yes so
 

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:28.130
no-no-no so here's the point no yes so
here's what here's the argument you look

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:28.140
here's what here's the argument you look
 

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.590
here's what here's the argument you look
around the world and the way the example

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:30.600
around the world and the way the example
 

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.690
around the world and the way the example
I give is that yes there's huge cultural

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:32.700
I give is that yes there's huge cultural
 

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.040
I give is that yes there's huge cultural
variation around the world just like you

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:34.050
variation around the world just like you
 

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:35.389

said to tell terian societies there's

00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:35.399

people have different foods and they

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:37.110
people have different foods and they
 

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:38.540
people have different foods and they
have different ways of dressing and

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:38.550
have different ways of dressing and
 

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:40.400
have different ways of dressing and
there's enormous cultural variation and

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:40.410
there's enormous cultural variation and
 

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:42.410
there's enormous cultural variation and
it's marvelous and interesting and

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:42.420
it's marvelous and interesting and
 

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:45.230
it's marvelous and interesting and
obvious to anybody but I think we're

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:45.240
obvious to anybody but I think we're
 

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.000
obvious to anybody but I think we're
missing the forest from the trees to me

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:47.010
missing the forest from the trees to me
 

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:48.980
missing the forest from the trees to me
this is like you and I are sitting on a

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:48.990
this is like you and I are sitting on a
 

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:52.009
this is like you and I are sitting on a
plane and we look at a hill that's 300

00:13:52.009 --> 00:13:52.019
plane and we look at a hill that's 300
 

00:13:52.019 --> 00:13:54.530
plane and we look at a hill that's 300
feet and 900 feet and we say those are

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:54.540
feet and 900 feet and we say those are
 

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:56.780
feet and 900 feet and we say those are
very different hills but actually if we

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:56.790
very different hills but actually if we
 

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:59.480
very different hills but actually if we
took a step back we would see that we're

00:13:59.480 --> 00:13:59.490
took a step back we would see that we're
 

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:01.790
took a step back we would see that we're
on we were on a plateau and one was a

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:01.800
on we were on a plateau and one was a
 

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.170
on we were on a plateau and one was a
mountain that was ten thousand three

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:03.180
mountain that was ten thousand three
 

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:04.910
mountain that was ten thousand three
hundred feet and another was a mountain

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:04.920
hundred feet and another was a mountain
 

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.319
hundred feet and another was a mountain
that was ten thousand nine hundred feet

00:14:06.319 --> 00:14:06.329
that was ten thousand nine hundred feet
 

00:14:06.329 --> 00:14:08.780
that was ten thousand nine hundred feet
and actually there there are these much

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:08.790
and actually there there are these much
 

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:11.329
and actually there there are these much
more deep and fundamental plate tectonic

00:14:11.329 --> 00:14:11.339
more deep and fundamental plate tectonic
 

00:14:11.339 --> 00:14:13.759
more deep and fundamental plate tectonic
forces that are creating these two

00:14:13.759 --> 00:14:13.769
forces that are creating these two
 

00:14:13.769 --> 00:14:15.889
forces that are creating these two
mountains that are very similar but we

00:14:15.889 --> 00:14:15.899
mountains that are very similar but we
 

00:14:15.899 --> 00:14:17.960
mountains that are very similar but we
are just focused on the superficial top

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:17.970
are just focused on the superficial top
 

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:19.850
are just focused on the superficial top
so the argument in the book is that

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:19.860
so the argument in the book is that
 

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:21.680
