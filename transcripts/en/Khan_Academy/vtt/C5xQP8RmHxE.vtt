00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.170
We're on problem 66.

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:10.870
And it says what is x squared
minus 4x plus 4, divided by x

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.070
squared minus 3x plus 2, reduced
to lowest terms?

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.280
So they probably want us
to factor each of these

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.610
quadratics and see if any of
these terms cancel out.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.060
So let's try to do that.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.550
So the numerator, this seems
pretty easy to factor.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.100
What two numbers when I
multiply them equal 4?

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.910
And when I add them
equal minus 4?

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.010
Well it's minus 2, right?

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.140
Minus 2 and minus
2 is minus 4.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.930
Minus 2 squared is plus 4.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:41.380
So this is x minus 2
times x minus 2.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.820
And you could test it if
you don't believe it.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.390
Multiply that out.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.580
Divided by, let's see,
what two numbers?

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.250
This looks factorable.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.490
They both have to be the same
sign because when you multiply

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.640
them you get a positive.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.530
And they're both going to be
negative, because when you add

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.630
them you get a negative 3.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.910
So let's see, minus
2 and minus 1.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.390
Minus 2 times minus
1 is positive 2.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.740
Minus 2 plus minus
1 is minus 3.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:09.140
So x minus 2, times x minus 1.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.810
And if we assume that x is never
equal to 2, because that

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.250
would make this expression
undefined, we cancel that out.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.490
You'll learn later that would
cause a hole in the graph,

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.240
because the function
is undefined there.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.660
And you're left with minus
2 over minus 1.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.225
And that is choice A.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.880
Problem 67.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.740
This is good practice.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:33.820
They give a bunch of it.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:42.250
They say what is-- I'll just
write it-- 12a cubed minus 20a

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:49.550
squared over 16a squared
plus 8a.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.300
Reduce to lowest terms. So let's
just try to factor out

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.270
things on the top and the bottom
and see what happens.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.880
So in the top, in the
numerator-- let me switch

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.980
colors-- both terms are
divisible by 4 and a squared.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.670
So let's fact out
a 4a squared.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.274
So we get 4a squared.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.490
12 divided by 4 is a 3.

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.210
And a cubed divided by
a squared is an a.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.240
So 12a cubed divided by
4a squared is 3a.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.620
Minus 20-- I could say
plus minus 20--

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.750
but you get the idea.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.440
20 divided by 4 is 5.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.500
And a squared divided by
a squared is just a.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.660
And if you don't believe
this, multiply it out.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.850
4a squared times 3a
is 12a cubed.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.290
And 4a squared times minus
5 is minus 20a squared.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.950
So it works out.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:40.690
You do the denominator.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.660
Let's see, both of these are
divisible by 8a, so let's

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.690
factor that out.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.990
16 divided by 8 is 2.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.950
a squared divided by a is a.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.260
So 16a squared divided
by 8s is 2a.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.540
And if you go the other
way, 8a times 2a

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.490
squared is 16a squared.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:59.960
So it all works out.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.110
Plus 1.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.150
8a times 1 is 8a.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.750
So let's see what we
could do here.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.310
This is becomes a 1.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.820
This becomes a 2.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.090
And a squared divided by a, this
becomes a 1 and this just

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.340
becomes just an a.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:23.330
And we're left with a times
3a minus 5, over 2

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.290
times 2a plus 1.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.920
And let's see.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.520
That is choice D.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.870
I thought maybe they'd want us
to re-multiply this out again.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.350
But that is choice D.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:44.240
Problem 68.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.280
Oh this is a good one.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.160
I'll just write it.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.490
They want us to multiply
something.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:04:00.570
So they say 7z squared plus
7z-- all of that--

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.650
over 4z plus 8.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.840
Times z squared minus 4-- all of
that-- over z to the third

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.649
plus 2z squared plus z equals.

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:18.250
So you must be like oh my god,
I have to multiply all of

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.430
these things and I have
to divide them.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.640
But the best thing, I'm
guessing, is to just factor

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.070
these out and all sorts of
things will start canceling

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.670
out with each other.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.880
And it will turn into a
pretty simple problem.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.280
Let's see, both of these terms
are divisible by 7z.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.960
So le'ts factor that out.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:37.110
So that top part becomes, 7z
squared divided by 7z, you

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.930
just have a z left.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.520
If multiply these, you
get 7z squared.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.950
Plus 1.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.200
If you multiply this out, you
get 7z squared plus 7z.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.220
When you multiply fractions,
it's just the numerator times

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.300
the numerator, over the
denominator times the

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.570
denominator.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.840
So this is times
the numerator.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.020
Z squared minus 4, that's a
squared minus b squared.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.970
So that's z plus 2, a plus b,
times z minus 2, a minus b.

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.630
That's just the pattern when I
say all those a's and b's.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.860
So that's z plus 2 times z minus
2, hopefully you can

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.660
recognize that at this point.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.930
And then all of that over--
let's see, we can definitely

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:24.470
factor out a 4 here, so that's
4 times z plus 2.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:30.390
8 divided by 4 is 2 times-- so
we can definitely factor out a

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:39.020
z here, so we get z times z
squared plus 2z plus 1.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.200
I think we're almost done.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.580
Now we have to factor this.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.840
Let me just rewrite
everything.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:50.520
So this is equal to 7z times
z plus 1, times z plus 2,

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.140
times z minus 6.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:06:02.400
All of that over 4 times
z plus 2, times z.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.130
And what's this?

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.650
This is z plus 1 squared.

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.720
Z plus 1 times z plus
1, 1 times 1 is 1,

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.790
and 1 plus 1 is 2.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:14.540
So times z plus 1,
times z plus 1.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.100
And now is fun part.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.350
This is a 1 here, that's
parentheses.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.900
Now we can start
canceling out.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.860
And we assume that the
denominator would never equal

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.120
0 and all that.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.400
Let's see, this z plus
2 cancels out

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.370
with this z plus 2.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.030
This z plus 1 cancels out with
one of these z plus 1's.

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.410
I'll do the one that's
written messier.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.310
And let's see, this z cancels
out with this z.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.920
And what are we left with?

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:46.020
Everything simplified to 7
times z minus 6 over 4

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.210
times z plus 1.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.740
I wrote a z minus b here.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.320
It's z plus 2 times z minus 2.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.090
All that pattern matching,
I made a mistake.

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.620
Z squared minus 4 is z plus
2 times z minus 2.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.690
Not z minus b, and I though
that was a 6.

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.790
So this is z minus 2.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.920
So this is z minus 2.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.550
And so that is choice A.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.640
Sorry about that error.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.760
Brain malfunctions
all the time.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.220
All right, now they want
us to do it again.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:36.790
They want us to find the product
of x plus 5, over 3x

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:44.940
plus 2, times 2x minus
3, over x minus 5.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.780
Frankly, there's not a lot of
simplification we can do, we

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:47.740
just have to multiply it out.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:53.765
So this is going to be equal to
x plus 5 times 2x minus 3.

00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:56.240
All of that over 3x--

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.240
I'm just multiplying the
numerator and then multiplying

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.880
the denominators-- 3x plus
2 times x minus 5.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:08.040
And now we just multiply
both binomials, x

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:11.470
times 2x, 2x squared.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:14.780
X times minus 3, minus 3x.

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:18.820
5 times 2x, plus 10x.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:22.730
5 times minus 3, minus 15.

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:23.290
Fair enough.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:24.750
Now you do the denominator.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:28.950
3x times x is 3x squared.

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:33.990
3x times minus 5, minus 15x.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:37.520
2 times x, plus 2x.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.460
2 times minus 5, minus 10.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.000
And now let's see if
we can simplify.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.690
We have the numerator is
equal to 2x squared

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:48.410
minus 3x plus 10x.

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:53.150
So that's plus 7x minus 15.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:56.360
All of that over 3x squared.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:00.060
And minus 15x plus 2x.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:05.890
That's minus 13x minus 10.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:07.790
And that is choice D.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.260
Next problem.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.290
Problem 70.

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:17.110
Boy, they they want us
to keep this up.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:18.480
This is good practice.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:30.540
So they write, x squared plus
8x plus 16, over x plus 3,

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:41.482
divided by 2x plus 8, over
x squared minus 9.

00:09:41.482 --> 00:09:44.190
So the first thing you do, when
you divide by a fraction,

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:46.200
it's the same thing is
multiplying by its inverse.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:55.210
So this is equal to x squared
plus 8x plus 16, over x plus 3

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:59.650
times the inverse of this,
x squared minus 9,

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:02.280
over 2x plus 8.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:02.850
Fair enough.

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:04.870
Now let's see if we can simplify
these a little bit.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.810
I'll do that in yellow.

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:10.980
So this is, 4 plus 4 is
8, 4 times 4 is 16.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:17.190
So this we can rewrite as
x plus 4 times x plus 4.

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:23.680
x squared minus 9, that's a
squared minus b squared.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:29.720
So this we can rewrite as x
plus 3 times x minus 3.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.070
It's going with the pattern.

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:33.880
We can factor out a 2 here, so
we can rewrite this as 2

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.240
times x plus 4.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.510
We have an x plus 3 there.

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:40.440
And of course, when we multiply
fractions, we're just

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.770
multiplying all the numerators
over all the denominators.

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:46.480
So it's almost like you
make this one line.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.270
So the numerator is x plus 4
times x plus 4 times x plus 3

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:50.520
times x minus 3.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:54.580
All of that over x plus 3
times 2 times x plus 4.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:55.790
So now let's do some
cancellation.

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:56.730
This is the fun part.

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:59.030
So we have an x plus 4 and and
x plus 4, cancel them out.

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.535
We have an x plus 3 and an x
plus 3, cancel them out.

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:10.220
And what are we left with?

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:18.020
We are left with an x plus
4 times an x minus 3.

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.390
All of that over 2.

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:24.320
And that is choice C.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.930
And I will see you in
the next video.
