00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.180
Today,

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.740
once again,

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.300
fundamentally, nothing new has happened.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.630
All human affairs are rehearsals, with
the same themes, played out against a

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.880
mildly changing background, but merely
articulating the essential futility of

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.200
existence and the damned nature of
humankind,

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.960
trapped like a fly in the bottle of life.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.780
We bring you a tree, which today, moved lightly in the breeze.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.940
There is so much
to be grateful for.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.600
We should note that in some cases wisdom did prevail.
 
('It is bad today, it will be worse tomorrow, until the worst of all happens' - Arthur Schoppenhauer)

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.860
Certain pontential murderes did not, today, pick up a knife.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.720
Certain sorts of rage were defused, for now.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.100
Some would be adulterers had second thoughts.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.000
Certain would-be suicide bombers saw
into the eyes of a child and could not do it.

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.600
We are no better than the beasts and
the earthworms, the lugs and the arthropods.
 
('From the crooked timber of humanity, no straight thing can ever be made' - Immanuel Kant)

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.640
This individual here, puts
us to shame.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:22.260
In any case, the most important things have happened today, have not occurred out there,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:28.080
in the plains of Anatolia, or the straits of
Singapore, or the corridors of the Pentagon,

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.800
but in your own soul, that vast, unexplored region,

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:42.520
itself no more studied than the dark side of a far-off planet in some distant galaxy.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.840
(Concentrate less on what is new: Dwell more on what is important)

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.780
(If you like our films, take a look at our shop, theschooloflife.com/shop

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.660
you'll find lots of thoughtful books, games, stationery and more.)
