a married mother in
the prime of her career,

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.641 align:start size:78% position:22%

it might be menopause,

<i> The loss of her life,

00:01:16.776 --> 00:01:19.478

00:01:19.578 --> 00:01:21.714 align:start size:84% position:16%
<i> When Alister and
 Cecile's only daughter</i>

00:01:21.814 --> 00:01:23.850

00:01:31.924 --> 00:01:33.959 align:start size:66% position:34% line:83%
Went to a gas station
close by our house

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:36.029 align:start size:56% position:44% line:83%
and, you know,
you swipe the card

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:37.963 align:start size:72% position:28% line:83%
and they ask you
to put in your zip code

00:01:38.064 --> 00:01:42.635 align:start size:63% position:38% line:83%
and when Mom
did those functions,

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:44.704 align:start size:72% position:28% line:83%
she slipped in the card
and she was like,

00:01:44.804 --> 00:01:47.840 align:start size:69% position:31% line:85%
"What's our zip code?"

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.210 align:start size:75% position:25%

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:56.348 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> where Cecile couldn't
 use her laptop</i>

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:58.818 align:start size:84% position:16%
<i> because she didn't
 remember her password.</i>

00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:01.054
<i> Then she couldn't remember

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:02.821

<i> for a once hugely successful

00:02:11.997 --> 00:02:15.368 align:start position:0% line:83%
She confided in me
that she had a conversation

00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:18.204 align:start position:0% line:83%
with her-her--
her manager at work,

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:24.377 align:start position:0% line:83%
who said that her performance
wasn't up to her usual standard.

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:27.547 align:start size:88% position:13%
I remember thinking, um,
it was very worrisome

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:31.484
that she could not perform
pretty basic addition easily.

00:02:46.632 --> 00:02:48.200 align:start size:69% position:31%
I grew up really fast.

<i> babysitting her mother.</i>

00:02:52.538 --> 00:02:54.139 align:start size:59% position:41%
And then eventually
got to the points

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.574 align:start size:63% position:38%
where it's like,
I'm feeding her now,

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:57.810 align:start size:47% position:53%
or I'm changing
her diaper.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.346 align:start size:81% position:19%

thought that I would be...

20 years old and
changing an adult diaper.

00:03:03.248 --> 00:03:04.450 align:start size:56% position:44%
Um, I thought
that was something

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.051 align:start size:66% position:34%

<i> almost 22% of them

00:04:46.185 --> 00:04:50.022 align:start size:94% position:6%
<i> How is it possible in

For children with autism,
education today often provides

00:16:46.104 --> 00:16:47.806

At one school,

Kids don't see differences
the way we adults do.

A brief trip on social
media these days

00:21:16.741 --> 00:21:18.977 align:start size:81% position:19%
shows you how divided
we can be.

00:21:19.077 --> 00:21:21.112 align:start size:91% position:9%
Which is why it's good
to remember a simple truth,

00:21:21.212 --> 00:21:22.914
we all want friends.

00:21:23.015 --> 00:21:27.218 align:start size:84% position:16%
We all want to feel
included and supported.

00:21:27.318 --> 00:21:30.722 align:start size:94% position:6%
In that way, Amiel and Elise
are teachers reminding us

00:21:30.822 --> 00:21:34.725 align:start size:91% position:9%
that embracing differences
opens doors and minds

00:21:34.826 --> 00:21:37.228
to friendship
and happiness.

00:21:37.328 --> 00:21:39.731
That's gonna do it
for us this week.

00:21:39.831 --> 00:21:42.667 align:start size:91% position:9%
We'll see you next time on
"Your Fantastic Mind".
