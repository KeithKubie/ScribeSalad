00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.120
Based on the dark brooding comic

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.200
That became a children's cartoon

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.369
That became the worst musical tour of all
time

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:20.590
Comes a 90's movie that proves the turtles franchise
was ridiculous way before Michael Bay got

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:21.500
his hands on it:

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.540
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2: The Secret
of the Ooze.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.969
The men in creepy rubber turtle suits are back in the hit sequel that held up much better when you were a kid, featuring

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:42.780
Cheesy looking fight sequences,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.010
Outdated 90's references,

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.749
Corny freeze frames,

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:53.710
And bad cosplay.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.269
I guess it looks better than ugly CGI...

00:00:58.269 --> 00:00:59.390
Ugh!

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.109
Your favorite turtles have returned to kick some shell

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:07.800
But this time, due to stupid parent complaints about the first movie, watch as their iconic

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.720
weapons stay in their holsters and instead see them fight with  

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.650
Belts,

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:12.570
Yo-yos, 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.500
Ties,

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.430
Blankets,

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.300
Soft Nerf bats, 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.540
Nerf bats,

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.259
Sausages,

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.409
"Combat cold cuts!"

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.360
And words.

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.200
"Cant we talk?"

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.200
"Shredder, you gotta listen to reason!"

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.060
C'mon! Just stab somebody already!

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:33.219
Get ready to hang ten with these four overly-large trained ninjas who are terrible at hiding,

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.759
Being silent,

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:38.189
"SHREDDER!"

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.850
Or sneaking around.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.500
Oh did they get stuck in a net? Sure would
be great if they could use their SWORDS OR SOMETHING!

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.700
I mean, c'mon! He's got 'em right there on his back!

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.760
What are they doing?

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.450
In a world full of cartoon characters and action figures you loved, spend more time with these human characters

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.899
you don't, like

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.880
Keno, an obnoxious little twerp,

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.090
"Dream on, dweeb!"

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.950
"But when I do, I'll dream of something a little thinner!"

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.049
This boring science guy,

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.869
And this complete random lady who calls herself April O'Neil

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.970
Did the people who made this even LIKE the
cartoon? Where's Krang? Slash? Baxter? So

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.800
bogus.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.060
Shredder has returned.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.650
And returned.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:21.470
And returned.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.080
And he probably smells like sh*t now,

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.370
Watch him strike fear into the hearts of men
with his ability to stand and do nothing while

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.269
his enemies are right in front of him.

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.409
And his lieutenant Tatsu, who...

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:40.069
also stands and does nothing while his enemies
are right in front of him.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.580
Together, they'll recruit a city inexplicably filled with martial arts-trained teenage runaways

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.740
who vastly outnumber our heroes yet can't ever seem to take out   

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.760
four slow dudes in huge rubber turtle suits.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.000
Why are they dancing?

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.900
Tremble as they battle for control of the
secret of the ooze, which is never really

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.680
explained now that I mention it

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.000
But for some reason it can

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.700
Turns turtles into ninja turtles,

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.330
Turns flowers into bigger flowers,

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.310
And turns BeeBop and Rocksteady into two
lame-ass rip offs that no one ever asked for!

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.490
"Mama!"

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.040
So gear up for a kid's action flick so terrified to show any fun ninja action its climax consists of taking out

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.269
the Shredder with a guitar solo.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.233
Taking out the Super Shredder with a bridge collapsing on itself.

00:03:32.733 --> 00:03:34.093
And a Vanilla Ice concert.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.780
"Go ninja, go ninja, go!"

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.100
When did they have time to coordinate this sh*t?

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.659
Stop dancing with Vanilla Ice.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.780
STOP IT.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.599
What are you doing?!

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.260
No ninja. No ninja. No!

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.030
Starring...

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.590
The Blue Ranger

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:54.590
Wreck-It-Raph

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:55.930
Bart Simpson

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:56.900
Nerdatello

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.489
Ratniss Neverclean

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.299
Surf Ninja

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:01.329
Asian Darth Vader

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:02.819
April's Mom

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.030
and Justin Bieber's Dad

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.549
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: Secret of the Ooze

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.579
So parents were mad about them using their
weapons, but totally OK with them advocating

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.500
an all-pizza diet?

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.200
Pssssh. Hypocrites.
