00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.690
OH MY GALAXY WE FOUND GRAVITATIONAL WAVES.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:08.960
AAAHHHH

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:09.980
Hey star-gazers

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:16.890
A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away...two
black holes collided in a fateful swirling

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:17.890
waltz.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.590
Just like when you toss a rock into a pond
and the KERPLUNK creates ripples on the surface

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.240
of the water, this collision sent ripples
through the fabric of space time.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.670
And we finally detected one of these ripples
or as researchers call them, gravitational

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:31.670
waves.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.230
We’ve been looking for these kinds of waves
for a long time.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.820
Albert Einstein first proposed their existence
in his theory of relativity, OVER A HUNDRED

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.820
YEARS AGO.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.060
So we’ve been searching for them ever since.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.350
And just how the ripples in the pond get smaller
as they move further from the KERPLUNK point,

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.780
the ripples in spacetime get smaller too.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.530
That’s why they are so hard to detect.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.530
Until now!

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.710
Today (LIGO) or the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave
Observatory announced that they found the

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.899
galactic KERPLUNK by detecting, or hearing,
one of the ripples.

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:02.899
shhh listen.

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.360
Ladies and gentlemen listen to that beautiful
sound.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.110
Ahh music to my ears.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.700
This signal was seen on September 14th last
year, but the cataclysmic event that caused

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.100
it happened nearly 1.3 billion years ago when
two black holes collided.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.400
While two black holes colliding has been theorized,
it hasn’t been observed before.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.120
The theory goes that two black holes will
circle each other and lose energy that’s

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.979
released as gravitational waves.

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.090
Over time, they will get closer and closer
over the course of a few billion years then

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.020
finally collide in a fraction of a second.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.400
This releases a large amount of mass as energy
in the form of gravitational waves.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.500
In this case, the black holes were about 30
times the mass of the Sun and were moving

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.170
at half the speed of light in that last fraction
of a second.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.300
This huge impact sent a shock wave of gravitational
waves, or ripples in spacetime, through the

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.540
universe at the speed of light.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.090
But as massive as that collision was, the
reverberations that reached us were tiny.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.420
Like "one one thousandth the diameter of a
proton," according David Reitze,(right-z)

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.600
the executive director of LIGO.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.050
LIGO was able to detect such a tiny wiggle
by using two labs - one in Livingston, Louisiana,

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.870
and one in Hanford, Washington.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.650
The labs used massive and precise lasers.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.150
Like 2.5-mile long lasers beams that can read
10,000 times smaller than a proton.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.430
These lasers were fired into two L shaped
pipes that bounced light around a series of

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.430
mirrors.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.870
A strain in space-time would change the timing
of when the lasers reach their destination.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.260
And that’s just what happened on that fateful
day.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.050
The same wiggle showed up on the detectors
in the two labs just 7 milliseconds apart.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.520
And more incredible, these wiggles matched
up to what supercomputer models of gravitational

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.250
waves had already predicted.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.700
Which were based off of calculations from
Einstein’s theory of relativity.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.890
So it’s the real deal.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.830
We know have solid evidence of gravitational
waves, and evidence of binary black holes!

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.910
And this discovery proves Einstein’s theory.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:00.910
FINALLY.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.370
We’ve been searching for these guys for
a century!

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.379
Rumors have it that this discovery could make
the short list for a nobel prize!

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:08.379
Why?

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.050
Well researchers are hailing that the discovery
could be as exciting as when we discovered

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.050
x-rays.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.530
LIGO co-founder said it has “opened a new
window onto the Universe".

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.709
Studying and tracking gravitational waves
will help us better understand black holes,

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.860
supernovas, other really large space events
and even possibly the fundamental laws of

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:27.860
the universe.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.240
We’ll learn so much more about the universe
and how it works as LIGO upgrades their equipment

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.319
to become more and more sensitive.

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:39.000
And in a few decades the European Space Agency
plans to launch a space-based gravitational

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.310
wave detector.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.990
So hopefully more gravitational waves will
be detected.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.860
If you want to learn more about this amazing
discovery, check out the study published in

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.590
the journal Physical Review Letters

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:49.590
Wow.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.860
Just wow guys.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.269
so much incredible science happening right
now, in our lifetime!

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:55.690
Einstein would be so proud.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.560
If gravitational waves seem like a familiar
concept, it’s because we’ve talked about

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.150
them before on DNews.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.470
A telescope called BICEP2 is looking for evidence
of gravitational waves of a different kind,

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.010
from the most cataclysmic event of all time,
the big bang.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:40.080

episodes, right here.
