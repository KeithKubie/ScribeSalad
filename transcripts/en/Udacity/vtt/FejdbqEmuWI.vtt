00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.500
So now we've talked about how the cache works for

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.580
updating normal files from the cache. Now the whole app

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.860
cache system is actually very complex. It's a very complex

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.670
algorithm that the browser goes through to get files out of

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.230
the cache, figure out whether it should update the cache,

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.010
check the different sections in the file. We do want to

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.980
talk briefly about the network section for files that always

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.490
need to be loaded from the network, so let's go take

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.290
a look at that. The network section was supposed

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.750
to make it easier to build applications that were

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.690
occasionally online, but it turns out that's pretty hard

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.400
to do. As we talked about before, it's hard to

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.320
answer the question definitively if you're online or offline.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.840
One common thing to do is in the network section

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.480
at the bottom to put a star, or even

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.950
just to only have a star here. This basically means

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.130
anything that anything we haven't specified already further up in

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.560
the application cache in the cache section, you should just

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.220
go to the network for. This is actually isn't a

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.960
great thing to do. If you have any blocking resources

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.240
in your file, or in your application that haven't been

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.360
listed in the cache file, it's going to sit there and

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.200
wait until it times out. So what you should really

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.990
do, is develop without that network star. Even if you add

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.300
it later. That way, your cache updates in the

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.270
console will actually show you if you're missing files.
