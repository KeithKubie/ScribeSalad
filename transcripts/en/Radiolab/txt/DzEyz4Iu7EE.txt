Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radio lab radio lab from W. N y. S. T. E. N. N. P. R. Yay. I'm Jad Abumrad. This is radio lab, the podcast. It's just me today. Robert is, uh, traveling. So, um, but I do have a short little story for you. The actually actually it's two stories, uh, that I've been thinking about for quite awhile. Um, it's about the mysteries of creativity, any piece of music and a neurological condition that unite to people across space and time.

Speaker 2:          00:39          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:40          Okay. The first story begins in the early 1980s in Vancouver, British Columbia with a woman named Anne Adams who was a brilliant cell biologist and was highly articulate. That's her husband Robert Adams, extremely capable with language. She did cancer research. He actually developed a cell line. Really I believe still exists. Wow. So she was very sharp as a scientist. She was a natural, but then rather suddenly at the age of 46 and kind of does a one 80 something happened in 86 which changed the course of her life. It all started when their third son, Alex, gets into a really bad car accident. And we were told that he would probably never ever walk again and decided she's going to take some time off to help them recover. And he does. He does learn to walk again. But while at home she just decides to quit, quit science and become a painter.

Speaker 1:          01:36          Yeah. And made up her mind then and there that she was gonna take up art full time. Had she ever painted before? Well, she did a fair amount of it when she was in high school, which was a very long time ago. So the whole thing struck him as kind of out of the blue, but he rolled with it and uh, within a short period of time she had converted a room in their house into a studio and she was painting houses and buildings, little churches simple at first, but then after that brightly colored versions of what you see when you look down the barrel of a microscope, you know, cells, bacteria after that, strawberries, a series of paintings involving these blazing red strawberries, for instance, a water faucet. And out of what would becoming a scream of strawberries. There was things called Strawberry Universe where the strawberries had rings around them like Saturn and so on. I think there was something like 35 or 36 strawberry painting. Wow. But then she would switch to something else even after their son had fully recovered, even threw away his crutches and went back to school and kept on painting. And she would work all day long, 10 hours a day, making these paintings as it got bigger and bigger and more abstract. And there were times he says when he was like, wow, because for someone who hadn't painted since high school, she was suddenly so prolific

Speaker 2:          03:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          03:01          and it's entirely possible that something was happening to her. Even then way below the surface. I mean, on the surface she was just painting and it was working. People were buying the painting, she was having solo shows, she was becoming a successful artist. But then in 1994, she decided, I don't know what gave her this idea of big, I never knew what gave her any of her ideas, but um, she decided she was going to do a painting of, well, this

Speaker 2:          03:33          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          03:33          Bolero Bolero. Yes. Yeah. We'll arrow rabbit says he's not quite sure how it happened, but at some point that year and heard this famous piece by Maurice Ravel became obsessed, couldn't stop listening to it, then playing it on the piano, the play. Then deconstructing it, mapping every pitch and the melody and the bass to a color. Here's a, uh, here's one page which isn't very long. This is from her notes. She's got a silver, a flat copper, B leaf, green, B flat, metallic green. Eventually the painting was quite a large work, two panels side by side, very electric colors, a blizzard of symbols and triangles, little tooth type things with marks on them. That all mean something and rectangles marching back and forth. Across the first panel, there was a triangle in the bottom of each one of the rectangle and the height of the rectangle represented the loudness. It's an incredibly obsessive translation of the music into visual language and just like the melody in Bolero, the symbols repeat and repeat and repeat, obsessively getting bigger and bigger and bigger until at the very end of the second panel, things unraveled. By the way, her title for the painting was unraveling Bolero. And here's where things start to get a little spooky and did this at a time when, um, she knew nothing about rebel. She called her piece unraveling Bolero, having no idea that that's exactly what would happen to ravel right after he wrote Bolero

Speaker 3:          05:12          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          05:12          which brings us to story number two. Well, okay. Should we jump in? Yeah, please. This is RB Orenstein professor of music at the Aaron Copeland School of Music at Queens College. He's written about Revelle perform rebel talk to anyone who ever knew rebel [inaudible]. He kind of is a much, shall I say, kind of a living presence inside my head too. Okay. Maurice Ravel is composer obviously one of the greats born at 1875. Papa was an engineer. Mother was from an old busk family as in she was Spanish. Yes. Which is why, uh, some of his music Lake Valera does sound a bit Spanish. In any case, mom encouraged them to study music. He goes off to Paris in the 1890s meets Claude WC, and together they sort of invent this style of music, which we now call impressionism, which was this kind of free floating, almost dreamlike, sensuous, a lot of colors.

Speaker 1:          06:05          The Flower, yes.

Speaker 2:          06:09          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          06:10          but then like an ravel makes a kind of shift. 1928 when he was 53 about the same age Anne was when she did the painting. Oh l is having an absolutely phenomenal year. Just toured the United States, performed for thousands. You set the zenith of his creativity and he's back in France at a beach house wearing a pink bathing suit. The story goes right before he steps out onto the beach. This melody swoops into his head. He runs over to the piano, takes his index finger, and he goes, Duh, Duh de de [inaudible]. There it was. It just came to him fully formed. Well, he, I don't know if he played the whole melody, but he at least started it off. But here's the shift. When he sat down to flush the whole thing out, instead of developing the melody, making it super flowery, like his other stuff, you said, no, I'm not gonna do that. I'm going to take this melody and repeat it again and again and again, and then again, some more and then some more. The theme never changes. One note, the only thing that does change is the orchestration which grows around the melody.

Speaker 1:          07:18          Terry slowly, bit by bit gets bigger, bigger, more company meant more instruments play the melody, the melody itself for 340 bars never varied.

Speaker 2:          07:34          Yes.

Speaker 1:          07:37          When he says where the performers, they're ready to see a psychiatrist. By the time they're done playing this piece and reveal at the first performance in Paris, some woman screamed out these crazy,

Speaker 4:          07:51          which turned out to be, well not exactly true, but in the neighborhood six years after he wrote Bolero, this is 1933 Revelle begins to forget words. He'd always been forgetful. So no one really noticed at first. But then one day at dinner he grabs the knife by the wrong side and he doesn't realize it. And he continues to try to eat holding the shop side of the knife and tried to cut with the handle. Then he visits a friend, leaves, not two hours go by, knock on the door. It's ravel again. He didn't remember that he'd been there before just two hours earlier. Eventually by 1935 he could not ride anymore or speak. His language had evaporated. RB says there are documents where you can see Revelle desperately trying to relearn the alpha.

Speaker 5:          08:38          A a a a

Speaker 4:          08:42          over and over again.

Speaker 5:          08:44          Wow. B B

Speaker 4:          08:47          with a kind of a shaking hand, very small. It's very, very painful to see

Speaker 2:          08:58          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          08:58          whatever it was that was wrong was getting worse. Here's the weird symmetry, just like ravel, six years after finishing herbal Arrow by 2000 I would say, and also begins to forget words. She would try to say things and couldn't. She would try to find words and couldn't.

Speaker 2:          09:19          So how are you today? Fine.

Speaker 4:          09:23          Eventually an ends up at the University of California, San Francisco, and this was in 2002 when they gave her a bunch of tests.

Speaker 6:          09:29          Can you tell me your, your full name, please.

Speaker 2:          09:33          Am Teresa Adams.

Speaker 4:          09:36          There's a video of one of these tests in it. You can see Anne sitting at a table in a black sweater, gray hair glasses. Very composed. Can you tell me your address? Like someone who's used to knowing the answers to questions people ask her.

Speaker 2:          09:52          Four 23 which town? Um, which town? Vancouver. Great.

Speaker 6:          10:13          By the time Anne had come to see us, uh, her communication abilities were markedly diminished.

Speaker 4:          10:19          That's Dr. Bruce Miller. He's a neurologist. He runs the memory and Aging Center at UCF.

Speaker 6:          10:24          Example, we asked her a to describe. Okay. Otherwise you used to take a look at this picture, a very complex, rich picture with take your time children with a kite, with a sailboat on the ocean. And please tell me what you see. Any, if you can please try to speak in sentences and would it be able to say single words with no grammar. She'd go sailboat,

Speaker 2:          10:49          tree boy, water people, kite tight flag.

Speaker 6:          11:02          And uh, that four or five words would come out over about a minutes time. She was very frustrated.

Speaker 1:          11:12          Both Ann Adams and Merissa val were unraveling in the exact same way, at the exact same speed to the same soundtrack you might say, but just roughly 60 years apart. We think he and Anne down to the very molecular process had the exact same disease and he thinks Bolero the music and then the painting in both their cases was the first symptom of that disease.

Speaker 4:          11:37          This takes a couple of steps to explain, so bear with me, but to start, the disease is called frontotemporal dementia. That's Jonah Lehrer author regular on our show and it begins when spindly cells in your frontal cortex. This part kind of right above your forehead start to wither and until your frontal cortex is puck mark with sometimes visible holes. We know this about an from tests and brain scans. We suspected about rebel because according to Arby, just before he died on December 28th, 1937 the French surgeon opened up his skull and saw that one of the lobes of the two lobes of the brain had sunk because it was disintegrating.

Speaker 4:          12:16          Now in both their cases, the part of the brain, the part of their cortex that got hit was on the left, which is the part that does a lot of things, memory, recalling, memories, finding memories. And most importantly for our story, it governs language. What happens is as the frontal cortex starts to fall apart, you lose the ability to access language. Now here's the thing about losing language. Our brains quickly debriefs are basically a series of circuits that are all tightly connected with progressive. And when a dominant circuit like language turns on, it's basically wired to turn a bunch of other circuits off, basically go, shh, six years, other parts of the brain,

Speaker 6:          12:56          we have this constant dance where one circuit or many circuits turn on and then they're obligatory. Les Turning off other circuits.

Speaker 4:          13:04          So language acts as a kind of break. Um, other things that brain could be doing, like daydreaming, thinking in images and pictures, but when the language is no longer there to hold things back, often what can happen is that those other parts like say the visual parts can just rush forward and suddenly the mind is, is flooded

Speaker 6:          13:22          with images that all of a sudden people have these rich, rich, intense sensations. The world is so beautiful and they need to express it. This is very common. We see a number of patients who become visually obsessed from every possible walk of life investment bankers who have never been interested in art before and never even walked into an art museum and all of a sudden they decide at the age of 55 to move into a loft, become an artist. One of the first glimmers of their illness is this insatiable need to create. That's right. How many of these cases have you seen 50 60. Wow. Manifest itself in as many different kinds of art as there are people, but at the end of the day, what all of these people have in common? Is it this explosion of creativity in their heads? Well, it's not a free flowing, loosey-goosey kind of creativity.

Speaker 6:          14:07          It's quite mechanical. The repetition obsession, they get stuck in a kind of loop taking one thing and just doing it again and again like an Adams painting or like Bolero. This drive to repeat happens very early on the course of this illness till he says what can seem like a simple creative choice to repeat a melody may actually be driven by a condition that you won't even know you have for six years. We think that this had something to do with the very unusual rhythmic repetitive sorts of music that ravel produced. And why the repetition? Where does it come from? Um, I think this is the release of a of a,

Speaker 4:          14:53          Bruce says, we don't really know, but he offered up a theory which I find fascinating, which may get to the root of creative obsession of any kind. He says there might be several parts of the brain that are held back by the language circuit and one of them is this very ancient part of our brains [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          15:13          Basal Ganglia. The part of the brain we move with,

Speaker 4:          15:16          you can call our reptile brain. This is the part of us that uh, governs, you know, basic behaviors like eating, running

Speaker 6:          15:22          motor programs that uh, we, uh, do repetitively every day.

Speaker 4:          15:27          That's all it does. It sends command saying move, move, eat, eat, run, run. Birds and snakes get by with basically just this part of the brain keeps them alive. Now normally he thinks the language part of us inhibits these habits, these repetitive motor programs that when the language part is not there to do the shushing, these motor commands filter up to. So imagine you're one of these people, your mind is suddenly flooded with pictures, maybe sounds and it's also flooded with these kinetic repetitive instructions, move, move, move, do it again. And in the early stages of the illness, you still have enough brain to make sense of it all.

Speaker 6:          16:02          There's still a lot of cortex that is still available to act upon this desire to repeat.

Speaker 4:          16:08          And so you get art that is obsessive and repetitive. Yes, but also beautiful and abstract, like unraveling Bolero. But then as the disease progresses and more of that front human part fades away, the repetition becomes much simpler and not creative at all. In the latter stages of a disease. He says, you'll often see patients [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          16:31          pouring water into a cup a hundred times in a day, a squishing ants over and over again. The complexity of the behaviors are diminishing as as we're losing these parts of the brain that make us so human.

Speaker 4:          16:44          Sort of what you see in answer work or painting startled, simple, explode into abstraction and then get simple again. But what's unusual compared to the other patients is that she kept painting almost all the way to the end until literally it was not possible for her to, to hold and direct a, uh, a brush or a pen. That's her husband, Robert Again,

Speaker 6:          17:05          and became progressively paralyzed on the right side of her body. She lost the ability to, to

Speaker 4:          17:10          paint 2005 early and that, that, that was sad towards the end. He says he would go into her studio and I would see her there in front of a blank canvas and she wouldn't be doing anything. She would just be looking at it. And I'd come back a couple of hours later and she still wouldn't have done anything. She had lost the ability to do the art, but she hadn't lost the drive. And that to me is one of the beautiful parts of Ann's story. But the drive to create can be as primal as the drive to eat that even after she couldn't move, could barely swallow. She still sat there trying. She had gone down hill so far by that time that, uh, that, uh, she was hardly recognizable as, as herself at some point in the disease. And you can see this in that, that early tape painting was all she had left. I don't have the memories of this painting had become literally all she was. Can you tell me what your job is or are you, are you still working? Uh, I do art. She died in 2007. Yes. In January of 2007 thanks to Robert Adams, Bruce Miller at the University of California, San Francisco and Arby Orenstein at Queens College. I'm Jad Abumrad. Robert will be back with me next podcast. See you then.
