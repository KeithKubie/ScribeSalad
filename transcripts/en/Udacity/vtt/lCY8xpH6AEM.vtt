00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.590
We just discussed
the basics of functions.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:04.850
You know how to define them,
call them and

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.330
you even know the nuances
of parameter naming.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.180
If you look through all
the code we've written so far,

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.720
you'll start noticing
functions everywhere.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.090
They're ubiquitous.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.790
Importantly, they let us
compartmentalize our code into tasks

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.300
which keeps things readable.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.750
Each small piece of code
has a clear purpose.
