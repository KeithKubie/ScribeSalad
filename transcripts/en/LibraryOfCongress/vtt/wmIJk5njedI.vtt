00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.300
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.480 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein: Amy is a 2009
Pulitzer finalist in feature writing

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.160
and a 2011 winner of the
Pulitzer Prize in feature writing.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.900
She is also utterly fearless
in certain situations,

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.420
including her job interview
for the Post two years ago.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.430
When she was telling the editor
in chief and the managing editor

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.020
about her attempts to track
down Frank Sinatra in Hollywood.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:42.220
And in order to find Mr.
Sinatra, she stalked, my word,

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.080
Milton Berle to his
lunch engagement.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.040
And got him as he was coming
out, asked him a few questions,

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.340
didn't learn anything
particularly too important.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.440
But during her job interview
she jumped to her feet

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.710
and she did her Milton
Berle impression.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.920
Amy got the job anyway,
and we have worked together

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.660
for the last two years,
utterly delightful to do that.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.050
Amy's written three books,
"Shadows Bright As Glass",

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.510
"The Teenage Brain",
and the one you're here

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.750
to hear her speak about
"Becoming Nicole."

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.510
So, please welcome Amy Eliss Nutt.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.170
[ Applause ]

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.320 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Amy Ellis Nutt: Thank you, Lenny,
and thank you to his brother Neal,

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.140
Neal Bernstein who without him
I'm sure I would not be here.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.540
I just want to clarify
about Milton Berle.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.940
He was a good friend
of Frank Sinatra's,

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.140 position:56%
and I thought maybe Milton would
know where he was, how he was doing,

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.260
if he was alive, if
he was compos mentis.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.150
And the valet people at
The Friars Club said,

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.460
yeah he's always here at noon.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.580
And his car picks him up at one.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.660
You know, he comes from this
door and gets right into his car.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.400
So, I thought, geez I'm only
going to have 30 seconds most

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.170
and what I didn't realize,
and this was my impression,

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.030
was Milton Berle was
about 102 at this point.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.010
And when he came out, if, you know,
Milton Berle, if you're old enough,

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:14.460
in his trench coat with a
cigar, this was Milton Berle.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.850
I don't know how you sign
that, but you don't have to.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.540
You don't have to.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.710
The beauty of that was I had
about an hour and a half.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.550
And he gave me give information.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.850
He had just spoken to Frank.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.400
Frank was compos mentis,
so my job was done.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.700
Back to New Jersey.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.650
Anyway, I'm thrilled to be here.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.770
My sister kept saying, "Oh,
there's going to be a crowd."

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.550
My sister is right
here, and I said, no no.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.860
And why did I say that?

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.380
Because I'm still stuck
five years ago.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.980
This book "Becoming
Nicole: Transformation

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.670
of an American Family" as I hope
you know, or you're just here

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.250
because you're curious
about the title,

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.480
is about a transgender
identical twin.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.600
Four or five years ago
this book fell into my lap.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.100
I didn't think, hey I want to
go and write about transgender.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.610
It was December 2011 when the first
article about the family appeared

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.620
on the front page of
the Boston Globe.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.950
At that time Marty Baron,

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.900
now the Washington Post executive
editor was the executive editor

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.370
of the Globe, a very
far seeing individual.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.640
It was really one of the
first major A1 stories

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.170
about a transgender child.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.220
I remember reading it and
being fascinated by it.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.520
And a couple weeks later I got
an email, someone I hadn't seen

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.090
in 30 years, a lawyer who
happened to be someone I had known

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.000
from a former life in Boston
when I was an academic.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.010
And she was now representing
the family in a lawsuit

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.400
against basically the Maine Human
Rights Commission in the state

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.290
of Maine and the school
that was discriminating then

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.150
against fifth grader
Nicole who was not allowed

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.840
to use the girls' bathroom.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.700
The family had been inundated with
press after the Boston Globe story.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.890
And they're very protective and
they didn't want to do anything

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:15.230
but they realized that this was
a big response, that this was a,

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.150 position:56%
you know, maybe important story that
they would want to tell eventually.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.950
And they thought, maybe in a
book, something that would come

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.910
out when the twins had
graduated from high school.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.780
I had just written, a
book had just come out.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.190
I just won the Pulitzer so
my name was in the news.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.920
So, this lawyer said
"Hey, I remember her.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.560
She's written a book."

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.180
So, this fell into my lap and
I remember saying to my agent,

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.300
this is a fascinating story,
but who's going to want

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.720
to read a book about
a transgender kid?

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.840
So, the timing of this
book obviously that it came

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.470
out when things were building
in 2014 and early 2015.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.110
It was supposed to come out
in early 2016 and they said,

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.470 position:56%
can you get it out in October, 2015.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.170
We didn't want to miss the moment.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.080
We didn't know the moment
was going to continue.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.170
So, this book, the twins right now
are entering their sophomore year

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.580 position:56%
in college at two different
branches of the University of Maine.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.890
And this is a family about
as ordinary as you can get.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.380
And at the same time,
utterly extraordinary.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.930
A mother who when her identical
twin boy was expressing at the age

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:29.710
of two, not the desire to
be a girl, the belief--

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.930
I will say he because
it was he at the time.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.450
The belief that he was.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.650
So, his question to his
mother and his father were,

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.150
"Well when do I get to be a girl.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.500
When will my penis fall off?"

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:48.020
You know, and so, couldn't
fundamentally understand

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.560
that people were treating
this child as a boy

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.040
when he knew she was a girl.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.460
Wyatt was a girl.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.410
This is a mother, very
practical, very down to earth.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.500
These were adopted
children from birth.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.050
The only two things were
important to her were

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.960
that her children were
safe and be happy.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.930
And that is what drove this mother
to figure out what was different.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.950
Not wrong, not bad, not odd.

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:21.610
Just simply, you know,
different from her other child.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.240
And she began the way a lot of
people begin with questions.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.770
She googled.

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.630
Boys who like girls toys.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:35.000
And that sent her on an odyssey
of trying to understand Nicole,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.010
was what Wyatt changed her
name to before the fifth grade.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:42.510
The father, very traditional,
conservative, Republican, hunter,

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:47.240
you got the moose antlers in
the room, and all of that.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.100
It took him longer.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:53.630
He had certain expectations
and beliefs.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.680
And it took a while
for him to get it.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.560
It took the court case
probably for him to get it.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.080
He now goes around
the country talking

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.380
about transgender kids
and especially parents.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.770
And he's particularly interested in
talking to men about their children

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.990
and trying to understand.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:15.610 position:56%
So, I wanted to actually talk a
little bit, the most important thing

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:17.670
to me actually are questions.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.880 position:56%
This is what I've discovered at most
of the events where I've spoken.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.870
I have to say the last
event that I spoke

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.230
at was the Mid-Manhattan Library, I
probably shouldn't have outed them.

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.250
Very nice people, it
was a crowd of about 30.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:30.730
That was good.

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:34.690 position:56%
But, there was, it was a man already
asleep when I walked into the room.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:38.370
So, thank you very
much for staying awake.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:42.860 position:56%
If you are from the
Mid-Manhattan Library, my apologies.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.630
So, where were we 50 years ago?

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:51.120
50 years ago, in November,
November 21st 1966.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.910
The New York Times ran
this small single column,

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:57.950
far bottom right-hand
corner of page one.

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:02.720
The first sentence read, "The Johns
Hopkins Hospital has quietly begun

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:06.140
performing sex change surgery."

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:10.630
What I love about that
sentence is the use of quietly.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:14.790
You know, I mean what an
editorial decision to put--

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:18.740
why not, has begun begun
performing quietly?

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:23.600
It was already a sense
of shame involved in this

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.520
that even the New York
Times was reporting this,

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.620
you know, with some hedging to it.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:33.010
Later in the story there's this
paragraph, "Psychiatrists believe

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:36.990
that transsexualism is caused
by prolonged conditioning early

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:40.280
in life, perhaps within
the first three years.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:44.210
Some cases in which a mother wanted
a daughter, instead of a son,

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:47.650
and raised her child
accordingly seems obvious,

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:50.160
but the origin of others
is obscure."

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.300
So, that was in 1966.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.430
Things weren't better
really by the '70s.

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:59.940
1977 there was an academic
study about an anecdotal story

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.430
that they thought might be useful

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:05.180
because of psychological
intervention instead

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:06.480
of surgical intervention.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.160
And it was about a
successful exorcism

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.960
of a transgender individual.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.870 position:56%
Even in the front lines of feminism,
that we have sentences like this.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:21.560
"Transsexuals are paying an extreme
tribute to the power of sex roles.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.920
In order to set their real
human personalities free,

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.770
they surgically mutilate
their own bodies."

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:30.210
That was Gloria Steinem.

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:34.490
Now, Gloria Steinem and I share
an alma mater, Smith College.

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:38.800
She's a lovely woman and 30 years
later she apologized for that

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.370
because it took, it
took a generation

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:44.260
and a half to understand more.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:48.830
And a lot of where we've gotten
to has been because of science

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:53.560
and now hand in hand with brave
people who are willing to come

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:58.470
out culturally to say who they are.

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:03.110
So, where are we now?

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:04.410
Okay.

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:08.700
There are, let me see there, 108--

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:17.860
just this year 187 bills have
been attempted to be passed

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:23.720
to limit the rights,
discriminate against transgenders.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:28.670 position:56%
Everything from religious exemptions
to government employee exemption,

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:33.310
to wedding services,
pastor protections

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:35.790
so they don't have to
marry transgenders.

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:42.640
187. The good news is,
only six have become law.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.520
The large majority are dead.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.610
There are a few that
are still active.

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:53.990
But at the same time, there are
dozens of states, 49 in fact,

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:59.080
and not 49 states but 49
bills have been passed that,

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:05.200
that do limit some small
rights to gender identity,

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.500
regarding gender identity.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:15.050
So, obviously, we're in the
middle of of a controversial time.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:18.780
But here's what I learned
in writing this book.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.080
I'm a reporter.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.700
I had to educate myself.

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:25.630
I had to do months and months and
months of research and science

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:28.730
and interview doctors
and endocrinologists.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:32.040
And at the end what I realize,
when I write the sentence

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:36.820
"Gender is a spectrum," it's not
a politically correct phrase.

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:40.130
And it's kind of nice and sort
of rainbow-y and all that.

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:43.610
It is the case that
gender is a spectrum.

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:48.510
Frankly, as are most things
in life, we think binarily

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:49.870
but we don't live that way.

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:51.260
And we are not that way.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.300
Look at the variety in this room.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:58.210
So, you know, this is
where, this is an assumption

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:02.910
that I had made oh spectrum sure,
but, you know, when you think

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:05.690
about it, there are 10
trillion cells in the body.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:08.270
There are 3 billion base
pairs of DNA in each cell.

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:13.500
There are 20, 25,000 genes
associated with those cells

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:18.260
that are either switch on
or switch off your genes.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:23.130
Gender identity is just one
tiny fraction of all the things

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:24.970
that make up a human being.

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:27.920
And yet we already know, science
tells us, there are some people

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:33.800
who are born XX, some
XY, some XXY, some XYY.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.910
There are people born with
androgen insensitivity.

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:41.580
There is no one cause
of transgender just

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:44.660
as there is no one cause of gender.

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:48.780
There are multiple factors
that go into gender.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:51.310
A lot of people ask me,
obviously, and this is one

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:55.190 position:56%
of the fascinating things about
this story, they're identical twins.

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:56.880
How could it be?

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.190
Well, we also know that identical
twins are not completely identical,

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:01.490
right?

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:03.220
They don't move exactly the
same, or think exactly the same.

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.400
They're bizarre cases where
they're separated at birth

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:08.090
and they do strange things,
you know, and they've named,

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:10.580
they've married the same
woman with the same name.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:14.460
But by the same token, identical
twins you've met them probably

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.170
who have very distinct
personalities.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:20.390
And the reasons for that is
something called epigenetics.

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:22.740
We're not just our genes.

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:26.170
We are the proteins
that code those genes.

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:30.610
We are the proteins that switch the
genes or the off that more androgen

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:33.630
in at a different time or less in.

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:39.100
So, what I came to realize
was that transgender,

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:42.660
as many things, is
not about aberration.

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.780
It's about variation.

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:48.230
And this was, this
was an insight to me.

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:51.700
So, we're not talking about
the acceptance of a disorder.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.370
We're talking about the
acceptance of differences.

00:13:54.370 --> 00:14:00.020 position:56%
Differences that for years and years
and years people kept in the closet.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:03.410
Right? So, when I wrote
this book, I got a letter.

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:06.680
If you subscribe to the Washington
Post and you read it avidly,

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:11.610
as I'm sure all of you do, then
perhaps you read earlier this year,

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:15.150
I think it was earlier, yes
earlier this year, the story I did

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:17.660
about Kate and Linda Rohr.

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:24.090
Kate Rohr was known as
Bill Rohr for 70 years.

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:28.580
Bill was married for 47 years
when he came out to his wife.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:31.170
His beloved wife, they were
high school sweethearts.

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:37.580 position:56%
Adored his wife, orthopedic surgeon,
accomplished, wrote many articles.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:40.170
They adopted a couple of children.

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:43.020
As Bill, he adored his wife Linda.

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.230
But he always identified as a girl.

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:48.860
And like Nicole, at the age
of three, and this is back

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:55.950
in the '40s I guess, he remembers
thinking why do people refer

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:58.370
to me as a boy?

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:00.540
Why am I wearing boy's clothes?

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:03.850
So, once again, it
wasn't that I think--

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:07.690
and look for some kids it's in
between and they're not sure.

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:10.340
But these are two cases of
people who absolutely knew,

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.430
I don't think I'm a girl.

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:14.740
I know I'm a girl.

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:19.530
But it took this woman, who at this
point was a happily married man

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:21.240
until the age of 67.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.440
And when he finally told
his wife after she said,

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.920
"You seem so happy lately."

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:29.450
Because had actually been giving
himself estrogen injections

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:30.750
and she wanted to know.

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:34.720
She was afraid he seemed so happy
that maybe he was having an affair.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.020
Had no idea.

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:39.500
And he finally decided he had kept
this in the closet all of his life.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:40.800
He didn't have a secret life.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.930
He didn't, you know,
dress in women's clothes.

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:44.600
He didn't, none of that.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:45.900
He had kept this hidden
all his life.

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.380
He said that he was transgender.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:49.680
And they talked all night.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.050
And she cried.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:55.470
And she cried not because she
was disappointed or stunned,

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:57.940
she cried because she couldn't
believe that this person

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:05.810
that she loved had spent the entire
of his life, her life in such pain.

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:09.470
They will be married
50 years next year.

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:12.350
They are going to have
a recommitment ceremony

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:14.090
as Kate and Linda Rohr.

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:16.220
And the story came out.

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:17.690
They were very worried about it.

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:20.160
No one else knew.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:25.120
Everything has been very--
it couldn't have gone better.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:30.650
And so, you know, Kate says,
Kate who used to be Bill says,

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:32.710
"This just couldn't have
been done 10 years ago."

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:34.210
And that's true.

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:38.820
So, on the one hand we're at
a remarkable place in history.

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.850
When we got to gay
marriage, I never thought

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:42.910
that would happen in my lifetime.

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:45.020
But, the speed of which
change is happening,

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:49.210
I believe is a testament frankly
to the young people in our society.

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:52.770
And maybe even to the internet
where we are exposed to everything

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:54.190
out there, the good and the bad,

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:58.400
but also all variety,
all types of people.

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.050
Kids today know people.

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:02.990
If they don't know them
directly they know them online.

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:05.140
They know what it means
to be transgender.

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:09.330
So, we're at an important
place in history.

00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:11.320
Because our laws I think
are trying to catch

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:15.580
up with this wave of sentiment.

00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:19.910
And, this is a family that
can help to tell that story

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:23.400
because they are like you and me.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.990
They're your mother and father,
your sister, your brother.

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:29.720
When I first met them, I couldn't
believe how open they were with me

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:33.970
and honest they were about
what they knew and especially

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:36.130
about what they didn't know.

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:40.030
About their flaws, and
about their change.

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:43.000
This is an everyman family.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.420
This is an every woman family.

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:48.290
And the other thing that I loved
about them was that everything

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:52.180
about each of the members of this
family turns gender on its head.

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:55.290
Wayne, who had to undergo the
largest transformation the biggest

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:59.480
transformation will cry
at the drop of a hat.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.200
It's very hard to do
interviews with him

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.070
because then he starts crying
talking about his wonderful family.

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:07.010
And then I start crying and
I said Wayne, please try not

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:08.660
to cry during this interview.

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:11.490
And it never works.

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:13.330
Kelly I've now known
for four or five years,

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:15.350 position:56%
I'm not sure I've seen her ever cry.

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:19.300
She is down to earth,
practical, she is hard nose.

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:20.700
She is a mother bear

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:24.220
who has protected her kids
and is still doing it.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:29.910
Nicole, this beautiful young
woman 18 now, you know,

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:31.890
very expressive personality.

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:34.910
She's an alpha-female.

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:39.470
She's you know, very
feminine, and yet loves, loves,

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:41.310
loves violent video games.

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:44.350
She just can't kill
enough people online.

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:49.880
Right? And she freely
says about her brother,

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:53.030
that he's incredibly sensitive.

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:58.160
That he's much more, Jonas
is much more in touch

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.490 position:56%
with his sensitive side than she is.

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:04.710
Jonas likes to write
poetry, he plays the guitar.

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:07.230
He's also gotten in trouble
his freshman year in college

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:08.530
because he was dating two girls

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:10.580
at the same time and
they didn't know it.

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:14.630
But please don't tell
anybody, right?

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:20.370
So, this is a family everything
about them teaches a lesson.

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:24.090
And it was frankly without them
even knowing it that they were.

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:28.000 position:56%
I feel blessed and I feel privileged

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.660
to have been able to
tell their story.

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:38.860 position:56%
I have to say that a lot of the, the
credit for the book goes to Wayne

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:43.350
because he was an obsessive
saver and organizer.

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:46.610
He's a safety and security officer

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:49.360
at a university, the
University of Maine.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:53.660
And he saved every piece of
artwork the kids did, every grade,

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:58.930
every psychological report, of
course all of the legal filings.

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:02.090
Hundreds of hours of video
that I watched, and I'm talking

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:03.960
like really boring video.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.890
But boring video that
was very telling.

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:09.180
I saw a lot of video
of them at bath time.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.490
And it was fascinating.

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:15.080
It was fascinating to see how long
Nicole, then Wyatt would stand

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.160
in front of the mirror kind
of puzzically [phonetic],

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:23.350 position:56%
puzzling trying to almost to sort of
figure out what she was looking at.

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:26.010
But it also means that
I knew everything

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:31.180 position:56%
about their lives beginning with the
video I saw of the twins in utero.

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:34.150
In utero where one of
the technicians wrote

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:38.870
after identifying the sexual
anatomy on the twins, still a boy.

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:44.550
Now I didn't, it's not clear what
twin the technician was writing

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:45.850
that about.

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:52.550
But, it goes to sort of underscore
that in a way language matters.

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:55.080
And our language has been
stuck in this binary.

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:59.990
I was talking to these wonderful
women, who are signing for us,

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:04.240
and I was asking them what
is the sign for transgender.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:09.330
And there's a couple of
different ways of saying it.

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:10.630
Saying it.

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:13.490
But one sign is the heart.

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:15.870
The heart or change of heart.

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:20.320
And there's the other
one is, help me out,

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.970
saying-- writing it out trans.

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:27.300
And this one [inaudible] woman
was saying she's not crazy

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:30.330
about the change of heart
because it indicates

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:34.020
like a change is taking
place and it has more to do

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:37.360
with changing your anatomy perhaps.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.980
This other young woman is
more comfortable with this

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.750
because she thinks
it's about the heart.

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:44.010
It's about who we are.

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:47.670
So, it's also about how
we interpret language.

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:52.260
Right? It's about the words we
use, but it's how we use them.

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:57.120
Okay. And even when we're trying
to figure out how to sign it,

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.590
it's fraught with difficulty.

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:05.190
You know, Nicole once said to me

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:09.690
that that stories breakdown the
walls that need to be broken down.

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:14.090
And I think that it
was the most profound,

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:18.820
one of the most profound statements
that she's ever, ever said to me.

00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:24.260
Honor Moore, the poet, also once
said, "We don't choose our stories.

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:27.500
Our stories choose us.

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:32.960
And if we don't tell them,
we are somehow diminished."

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.760
Thank you.

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:41.340
[ Applause ]

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:42.820
So, please, there's a lot,

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:46.650
I'm hoping there's a lot
of questions out there.

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:49.340
Hopefully that I can answer them.

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:50.640
Yeah, please.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.940
Questions.

00:22:54.350 --> 00:23:00.130
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for your
presentation and your work.

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:02.710
You mentioned the curiosity

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:06.170
about how two identical
twins could be different.

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:08.970
And you mentioned how
we're more than our genes

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:11.810
but we are in fact our genome.

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:13.110
And-- .

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:14.410
&gt;&gt; Amy Ellis Nutt: Our epigenome.

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:15.710
Yeah.

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:17.010
&gt;&gt; Clearly, yeah, and
clearly obviously,

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:19.280
you're also a student of history.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.580
&gt;&gt; Amy Ellis Nutt: Yeah.

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:23.000
&gt;&gt; In the sense that you looked
at how sexual orientation

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.490
and particularly how we think
about transgender folks has changed

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:30.790
over the last 20, 30, 40 years.

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:32.090
And I know that you're

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:34.550
in the session just
previously with James Gleick.

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:35.850
&gt;&gt; Amy Ellis Nutt: I was.

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:37.150
I asked a question.

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:39.390
&gt;&gt; So, I'm wondering if
you can be a time traveler.

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:47.670
And I'm wondering if you can given
the emergence of biotechnology,

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:52.220
the possibility of
genetic engineering,

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:55.590
gene editing, yada, yada, yada.

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:56.890
What do you see?

00:23:56.890 --> 00:24:01.450
What can potentially you see
20, 30, 40 years ago in terms

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:06.130
of how we might not only
consider sexual orientation by

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:10.130
but also perhaps manipulated
through biotechnology.

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:11.430
&gt;&gt; Amy Ellis Nutt: It was funny.

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:12.780
I thought you were going to
ask me to go into the past

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:16.130
to see how we accepted
people in the society-- .

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:17.430
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] we're always
looking at [inaudible].

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:18.900
&gt;&gt; Amy Ellis Nutt: Right,
and the societies that did.

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:22.670
Look, you know, Chris Bird's
genetic engineering's still very

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:25.840
controversial, and very new.

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.140
You know, and it all goes back

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:29.950
to what we started discussing
20 years ago in designer babies,

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:32.680
you know, can we identify
early things.

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:39.800
And I just think, yes, if we can
prevent diseases things like that

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:43.620
and that are going to
shorten a person's life,

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:45.320
then we need to do those things.

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:50.320
Do I think there's going to
be identification in utero

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:54.510
that a baby is getting
less androgen a male?

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:55.980
I don't know.

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:59.720
I think, I think there's, it's
sort of like when, you know,

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.290
10 years ago when we
thought, oh we're going to,

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:03.410
we're going to find
the schizophrenia gene.

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:05.450
Right? But we didn't find it.

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:08.590
You know, it's a whole lot
more complicated than that.

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:11.800
And I think that's also the case
of gender, and gender identity.

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:15.050
Look, there was a study that
was done recently looking

00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:18.040
at there are a couple of two
or three different structures

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:21.440
in the brain that on average
are different between men

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.680
and women, on average, right.

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.880
One has to do with the
release of hormones.

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.430
It's usually twice as
large in men than in women.

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:34.060
And this study was done looking
at thousands of brain images.

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:39.810
And it actually found that
between a third and a half of all

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:44.610
of those brain images had a
co-mingling of male, typically male

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:47.260
and typically female
brain structures.

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:54.330
A third to a half that only between
0 and 8% had all typically male

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:57.060
and all typically female.

00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:00.550
I mean what is a typical
male and a typical female?

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:04.340
Right? I mean it gets back to that.

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:07.700
When I say spectrum, I
really, really mean it.

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:10.880
And I don't think we can say,
here we are and then here we are.

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.480
We are a spectrum.

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:17.150
So, I'm not sure that there's
anything that we should

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:19.960
or could do in the future.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.790
I do know in the past, that
there have been societies

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:25.200
and there still are who believe

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.470
that there were three,
four, five genders.

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:32.220 position:56%
Most Native American tribes
believe there were multiple genders.

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:36.300
Many Asian societies
and cultures do as well.

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:41.120
So, yes? Oh, I'm sorry yes.

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.420
[Inaudible.]

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:47.700
&gt;&gt; Thank you for that
image of a spectrum

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.650
with respect to transgender.

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:54.080
I mean it's new to me
in my experience I think

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:59.700
of Christine Jorgensen which was I
think the '50s first sexual change

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:02.610
operation and that was
like black and white.

00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:07.940
And now the idea of the
spectrum is sort of opening

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:10.880
up my mind and thank you for that.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:15.140
So, my question is
within that context,

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:20.280
at what point does a difference,
I won't use the word deviation,

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:25.940
at what point does a
difference become a human,

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:29.500
a protected legal human right?

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:33.370
&gt;&gt; Amy Ellis Nutt: Oh, a
protected legal human right.

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:36.490
You know, we have a bill of rights.

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:40.670 position:56%
We do not have a bill of non-rights.

00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:43.300
You know, our Constitution
was about figuring

00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:45.520
out everybody we need to protect.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:53.010
They couldn't possibly foresee
transgender, right, 300 years ago.

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:55.430
So, it's about inclusiveness.

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:58.850
It's never been about
excluding someone.

00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:03.410 position:56%
It's always been about including who
are the, you know, the discriminated

00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:06.490
against populations
that need rights.

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:08.250
One of the fascinating
things about doing this book,

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:12.220
is I talked at length with
Paul Melanson, the man in Maine

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:15.370
who waged a kind of
one person battle along

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:18.640
with the Maine Christian
Civic Union against the Maines

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:22.670
and against this idea of allowing
Nicole to use a girl's bathroom.

00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:27.000
And he kept saying to me, and I
appreciated that he, you know,

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.010
answered all of my questions.

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:34.400
But he kept saying, it was about
giving someone extra rights.

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.860
They weren't like,
he had his rights,

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:39.630
and other people had their rights,
but these were like extra rights.

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:42.510
And it was something that was very
difficult for me to understand

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:43.810
because essentially it comes

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:46.610
down to you're getting
something that I'm not getting.

00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:48.550
But I don't think that's it.

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:50.360
You're getting exactly what I have.

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:54.990
You're being protected in a certain
way for a certain way you are.

00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:58.190
That's all.

00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:02.260
So, you know, I think our
great difficulty in life,

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:08.430
if it really comes down to it, is
that society favors conformity.

00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:11.700
Nature favors diversity.

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:13.080
Pure and simple.

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.340
Yeah, I know.

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:18.360
I know. I know, when I like
thought of that I was like,

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:20.940
oh yeah, yeah you got it.

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:23.730
But, yes?

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:25.030
&gt;&gt; Hi, thank you so much -- .

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:26.330
&gt;&gt; Amy Ellis Nutt: Hi.

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:27.630
&gt;&gt; For your book.

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:33.010
So, I'm a scientist and I was
very interested in Dr. Spack.

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:34.310
&gt;&gt; Amy Ellis Nutt: Yeah.

00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:37.780
&gt;&gt; He was trained by
the Dutch, I believe.

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:39.080
&gt;&gt; Amy Ellis Nutt: Yes.

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:40.380
&gt;&gt; Is that correct?

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:41.680
&gt;&gt; Amy Ellis Nutt: Yes.

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.980
A lot.

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:44.280
&gt;&gt; And I just couldn't
understand exactly why

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:49.490
from a scientific perspective
the Dutch refused to do anything

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:52.430
until I think, or no I'm sorry.

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:56.550
In London, they refused to do
anything until you're 16 I believe.

00:29:56.550 --> 00:29:57.850
&gt;&gt; Amy Ellis Nutt: That's right.

00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:02.040
&gt;&gt; And I wondered if you dove
into that at all in your research?

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.340
&gt;&gt; Amy Ellis Nutt: Yeah.

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:04.640
You know, I think that's something

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:07.130
that the Dutch are just
obviously an advanced civilization

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:09.810
and they're ahead of
us in so many ways.

00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:12.790
Except they're crazy bicycle people

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:15.240
and you could get killed
if you're not looking.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:19.590
But I think, you know, I'm
not so, I'm not as much sure

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:24.560
as it's a totally scientific reason
as it is this belief that children,

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:28.030
when are children grown up?

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:30.020
When do they have the
mental capacity

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:31.500
to make a decision for themselves?

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:34.480
And of course, I mean, I wrote
a book about the teenage brain.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.280
We now know that the
teenage brain is still,

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:39.590
it's only 80%, you know, developed.

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:42.690
It's not fully wired
until the early 20's well

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:44.760
into your, you know, late 20's.

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.070
So, all those people who
have kids still living

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:48.970
at home, this is the issue.

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:51.680
Their frontal lobes are
not completely wired yet.

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.310
You can go home and tell them that.

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:56.250
But it is in part determining

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:59.980
when is someone able
to make that decision?

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:04.730 position:56%
If it's the case that they want, you
know, gender affirmation surgery.

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:09.860
And I think what we've done,
at least in the United States,

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:14.560
is we've gone to, it's how
far are you willing to go.

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.060
We go to very long lengths.

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:22.550
The ability to, to delay puberty
has been critical in this regard.

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:24.040
Absolutely critical.

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:25.340
There's a big difference

00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:28.290
in transitioning before
you've reached puberty

00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:31.420
as opposed to post puberty.

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:34.650
Especially for girls,
especially for young boys

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:38.330
who identify as, as female.

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:42.590 position:56%
You know, to have your face
enlarged, the hair, everything else,

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:44.170
it takes a lot of surgeries.

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:48.220
We know this, you know, by some
of the celebrities out there.

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:53.310
But if that's done before puberty,
if your puberty can be suppressed

00:31:53.310 --> 00:32:00.590
and can be delayed until
your about to enter puberty

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:04.660
of the sexual anatomy that you
are born with, then there's time

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:08.810 position:56%
for the person to go through all
the psychological tests to also live

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:13.030
as if it's a transfemale
to live as the transfemale.

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:16.620
To find out if that's
exactly what's comfortable.

00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:21.860
And then to be able to start taking
estrogen instead of, you know,

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:24.280
allowing male puberty to take over.

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:27.720
And the consequences
of it are dramatic.

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:32.030
I urge you, and I'm sorry that
I don't have a presentation,

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:33.610
but if you go online and
look at the photographs

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:35.600
of Nicole, she's gorgeous.

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:40.250
Right? And she's, you know, about
five inches shorter than Jonas.

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:42.070
And she's, she's all female.

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:49.330
You know, it's, it's so much more
difficult later in life to make

00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:52.080
that physical changes and if
that's what you decide to do.

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:56.080
So, I'm not so much, I'm not sure
it's, I do believe that the ability

00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:00.750
to delay puberty scientifically,
medically has been key

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:06.250
to allowing children as
young as 16, now 17 or 18.

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:10.850
It's still typically 18, to,
you know, change their gender

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:14.640
at that point, if that's
what they decide to do.

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.360
Thank you.

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:19.840
&gt;&gt; Hi, I would like to tell a
brief story really quickly just

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.440
to frame my question.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.970
So, you said two things
that really jumped

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:24.470
out to me in your introduction.

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:29.340
One the power of language and two
that it's taken a generation or two

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:30.920
to get to where we are today.

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:35.750 position:56%
And that's the junction of those two
things have been a really big part

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:37.050
of my experience.

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:40.930
I have a sister who's a junior,
she's a senior at Grinnell College.

00:33:40.930 --> 00:33:46.380
She founded an alliance program
in our high school and she's very,

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:51.100
very active about the
transgender, LGTBQ community.

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:54.960
And then I have two parents who
are kind of struggling to engage

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.980 position:56%
in conversation with her about this.

00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:01.290
There was a time when we
were out to a family dinner

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:05.450
when my sister was explaining
that she identifies as queer,

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:08.270
which the terminology has
changed substantially.

00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:14.600 position:56%
And in my parents' generation that
was a very negative thing and it was

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:18.170
like trying, I was sort
of that middle ground

00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:21.220
to watch two people speaking a
different language understand

00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:22.520
each other.

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:23.820
&gt;&gt; Amy Ellis Nutt: Yeah.

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:26.510
&gt;&gt; I was wondering if you could
speak to any guidance or advice

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:28.790
about sort of two ends
of the spectrum in terms

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:31.790
of understanding this issue
and how we can communicate

00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:36.070
and not an aggressive, not a
militant, not an angry way.

00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:39.350
But like really engage in
mature conversation about it.

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:40.650
&gt;&gt; Amy Ellis Nutt: You know,

00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:43.730
I'm not sure I have any specific
advice except to talk about it.

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:47.510
And maybe to begin the conversation
with let's define our terms.

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:49.870
You know, when you, when you said,
you know, that she identified

00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:53.370
as queer, I'm a, I'm sure
your parents' generation

00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:59.060
where queer was usually
derogative, a derogatory sorry.

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:05.820
But, I was at a recent reunion,
college reunion and I was sitting

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:08.310
with a bunch of students and we
got talking about queer studies.

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:12.970
And I said please explain
to me what it is.

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:14.440
And it was eye opening.

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:19.750
Okay? I didn't know, you know,
it's about variation essentially.

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:23.760
And so, it was, it's important,
we have to, we not only have

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:26.880
to define our terms, we
often have to redefine them.

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:30.140
And so, I think it's important when
you have discussions like this is,

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:32.390
let's sort of lay out the
language first, let's make sure

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:33.940
that we're talking
about the same thing.

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:36.410
And this is what I
want you to understand.

00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:40.010
And, you know, if it's
about listening and trying

00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:44.600
to understand not about judging
and not about trying to match it

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.410
up to your own expectations.

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:48.470
I mean one of the reasons
I say this in the book,

00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:51.360
I think one of the reasons that
Kelly was so successful as a parent

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:54.510
and she is the hero of
this book, is that she grew

00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:56.210
up in a very dysfunctional home.

00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:59.420
Right? She was given up
for adoption by her mother.

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:02.650 position:56%
She left home at like the age of 15.

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:06.870
Kelly had no expectations of what
a perfect family looked like,

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:09.590
or what a perfect kid looked like.

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:14.800 position:56%
And I really think that that lack of
expectation freed her to allow her

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:18.930
to look at her children
as you tell me who you are

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:21.970
and let me help you be that person.

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:26.860
Yeah.

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:28.190
&gt;&gt; Hi. Some people claim

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:34.890
that transitioning transgender
children is merely an attempt

00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:39.810
to erase or make more mainstream
people who would have grown

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:43.580
up to be butch lesbians
or feminine gay men.

00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:47.080
How do you respond to that and
when you were doing your book,

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:52.790
did you research at all the radical
feminist view of transgenderism?

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:57.580
&gt;&gt; Amy Ellis Nutt: To answer the
latter question first, not really.

00:36:57.580 --> 00:37:01.080
It wasn't a part of the book
necessarily, but the first part

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:03.740
of your question is
very, very important.

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:05.610
And it was something that
I didn't mention first.

00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:09.260
And one of the things that I
realize and I understood was

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:12.020
that gender identity
is completely different

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:14.360
and a completely different
brain process

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:17.270
in development from
sexual orientation.

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:18.570
They are independent.

00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:20.410
Those are two different
things that are happening

00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:24.190
in utero and at different times.

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:28.450
Our sexual anatomy is set
as six weeks in utero,

00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:31.770
our gender identity
is like at six months.

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:33.620
I can't remember when
sexual orientation is,

00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:36.660
but it's a different brain process
happening at a different time,

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:38.980
which is why because I
was initially confused.

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:41.790
Transgender people, are
they gay are they straight?

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:45.690
You know, but because it's sexual
orientation is simply different.

00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:50.450
And it goes to our
understanding of variation.

00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:56.020
So, I think it's a mistake
to think that, you know,

00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:59.710
that to conflate the two.

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:02.520
I also think there's a, there's
a obviously there's an important

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:04.270
discussion happening with feminist.

00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:07.980
Look, I grew up, I came of age
in the '70s, you know, feminism.

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:12.040
You know, Gloria Steinem and
everybody after her and Mary Daly,

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:14.190
and, you know, all of those women.

00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:18.760
I think one of the mistakes and one
of the sort of knee jerk reactions

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:21.820
of some feminists right now,
and it's understandable,

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:26.090
when they see celebrities,
Caitlyn Jenner out there

00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:29.540
who are super feminine and
who talk about their shoes

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:33.390
and their dresses and, you know,
being feminine, that it's a bit

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:35.690
of an affront to people who say,

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:39.760
well do they really understand
what it means to be a feminist?

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.170
Or what it means to be a woman?

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:43.170
But, here's what I
learned from a different,

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:45.910
from another transgender
person who at the age

00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:48.400
of 40 was still wearing
like Mary Jane shoes.

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:51.140
She was a transfemale,
and I said Jennifer,

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:52.640
what the heck is it
with these shoes?

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.380
And she goes, "You know, Amy,

00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:57.210
it's I'm still just going
through puberty still."

00:38:57.210 --> 00:39:00.950
And then it occurred to me,
for a generation now of people

00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:04.820
who unlike Nicole are unable
to transition at the right time

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:08.360
in life, there are many, many
transfemales for instance

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:10.450
who are transitioning in
their 40's, their 50's.

00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:14.190
I know someone in their
early 80's who recently did.

00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:16.900
And so, when they transition,

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:19.750
they are essentially
going through puberty.

00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:23.940
And so, I think, I think
it's necessary for us

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:25.670
to give them a little slack.

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:32.010
To let, to let them experience,
the let them go through that.

00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:35.910
Will we look to these people,
then, to address these issues

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:40.610
and what it means to be a woman
and to join in women's rights and,

00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:45.340
you know, the need for, you
know, wage equality and all that?

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:47.130
Yeah. Absolutely.

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:50.720
But I think we have
to wait for that.

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:53.540
Maybe I'm a softy but.

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:54.840
Yes?

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:58.880 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I just want, thank you for this
book and her adding to our knowledge

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:03.100
of this particular issue because
I know when my sister in law

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:06.490
came out when she was
a sophomore in college

00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:12.410
and we were very strange
conversation.

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:16.040
I thought to myself, well she's
lucky to be born into this family

00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:19.600
because this is a family that will
accept her no matter who she is,

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:21.400
what she does, you know, whatever.

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:24.740
But it's been a difficult,
a difficult road

00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:27.800
for the family as well as for her.

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:32.420
And I just, I think to show
that it can be done-- .

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:33.720
&gt;&gt; Amy Ellis Nutt: Yeah.

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:35.020
&gt;&gt; In these mainstream families

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:36.320
because there isn't a
more mainstream family

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:39.320
than either Nicole's
or my sister in law's.

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:40.620
&gt;&gt; Amy Ellis Nutt: Right.

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:41.920
&gt;&gt; It's just small town America.

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:45.730
And it seems as though
you can't open a newspaper

00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:47.320
without finding another story.

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:49.730
So, this wouldn't be possible

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:52.060
without the publicity
that these stories get.

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:55.130
And so, it's pretty
amazing what's happened in,

00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:56.490
just in the past decade.

00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:57.790
&gt;&gt; Amy Ellis Nutt: It is.

00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:59.670
And you know, I think fear
comes from foreignness.

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:02.880
And so, the more people who are out
there saying "I am transgender,"

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:06.320
You know, this is what it looks
like, what it sounds like.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:11.570
I think it, you know, it diminishes
our, you know, the barriers we have

00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:15.940
to understanding something as
being, you know, foreign to us.

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:17.240
Thank you.

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:18.540
Yeah?

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:21.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I have
like 20 questions.

00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:25.520
I only have the one, so I think
the most pressing question is-- .

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:26.820
&gt;&gt; Amy Ellis Nutt: Yeah.

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:30.300
&gt;&gt; Is that, not just one
person is transitioning.

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:33.450
There's family, friends.

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:37.860 position:56%
They're all transitioning, so at the
end transwoman transman they are--

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:41.600
this is the most selfish
thing you're doing to our life

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:44.080
because to be selfish is necessary.

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:51.590
So, the question is, how do we
relate to our friends, our mates,

00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:54.740
our kids that what is
going on, you know,

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:57.990
only 10% of married
couples stay together

00:41:57.990 --> 00:42:01.150
within six months of hormone HRT.

00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:04.270
So, what's your advice to?

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:08.330
&gt;&gt; Amy Ellis Nutt: Wow, I'm not
sure that I have advice on that.

00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:12.110
And you know, not being
transgender I can't really speak

00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:13.410
to the experience.

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:18.490 position:56%
But from the people that I've
interviewed, you know, look the Kate

00:42:18.490 --> 00:42:22.800 position:56%
and Linda Rohr who are still
together after 47 years of marriage,

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:27.740
did it make a difference that Kate
came out as transgender at the age

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:30.960
of 67 as opposed at the age of 37?

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:32.260
Or even 27?

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:37.330
Probably. They still
had an active sex life.

00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:43.670
So, but it was, but what she, what
Linda knew was I love this person.

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:45.920
I have always loved this person.

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:49.050
But what she had to learn
as accepting as she was

00:42:49.050 --> 00:42:52.330
because they adore one
another and always have,

00:42:52.330 --> 00:42:56.290
what she had to mourn
the loss of Bill.

00:42:56.290 --> 00:42:58.500
And I think that that was
something that she learned

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:01.290
and I think she tries to
get that message out there.

00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:03.380
But she was losing something.

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:06.100
She was gaining something
and she still had something.

00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:10.270
And Kate at first was, you
know, didn't quite get it.

00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:11.570
But then she did.

00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:16.300
She had to mourn the loss of
a certain way she had been,

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:21.430
or her belief about this
person that she was married to.

00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:25.980
And I think, you know, grieving
over the loss is the beginning to,

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:28.310
is the beginning of
acceptance of what you have.

00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:32.400
And, you know, you meet this couple
now and they're like little kids.

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.690
I mean, they're joyful.

00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:37.420
You know, Linda gave Kate

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:41.980
on Valentine's Day a
cute little sexy nighty.

00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:44.340
You know, and this was like, yeah.

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:49.390
You know, and a bracelet and she
had to take her out to Macy's

00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:51.230
to learn how to do makeup.

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:55.390
And, it's a whole new world
that's opened up to her.

00:43:55.390 --> 00:44:00.180
And now because they're sort of
out, new friends, and experiences.

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:05.840
And it also for her, for this long
marriage it helped explain a lot

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:08.040
of the mysteries.

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:12.170
The mysteries of when Bill
delayed trying to have children

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:14.980
because he was petrified
he would have a child

00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:17.290
that would inherit
whatever it was that he had

00:44:17.290 --> 00:44:18.890
and have a tortured life.

00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:20.190
And she could never understand it.

00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:22.620
Because on the one hand he loved
kids and he wanted a family.

00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:25.140
But then he kept putting it off,
putting it off, putting it off.

00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:26.510
Or the depressions.

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:29.640
He left her for a few months
because he had to work things out.

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:31.320 position:56%
She didn't know what that was about.

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:34.370
So, a lot of the mysteries
of their marriage,

00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:37.710
of this wonderful marriage
were all cleared

00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:39.090
up practically in an instant.

00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:41.260
And that was a gift too.

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:44.320
To be able to fully understand
this person that she loved.

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:47.010
I mean, it beings in love.

00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:49.450
If we can remind ourselves of that.

00:44:49.450 --> 00:44:50.910
That that is where it begins.

00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:53.030
There are some people that
will not be able to get

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:56.200
over that hurdle of the change.

00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:59.060
But I believe, I believe
that there's hope

00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:01.150
that more and more of us can.

00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:08.570 position:56%
And that if we allow each other the
time, you know, and the conversation

00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:12.400
to understand the changes going on.

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:14.230
You know, then we can do it.

00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:15.530
Nothing stands still.

00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:17.420
God help us.

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:19.600
You know, lives are short.

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:23.220
And if we understand that I
think that there's a great chance

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:28.760 position:56%
that we will embrace what previously
we thought was unthinkable.

00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:31.700
Well that's a wrap up I think.

00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:34.770
See I'm so short I
couldn't see the time card.

00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:36.070
Thank you.

00:45:36.070 --> 00:45:41.830
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:45:41.830 --> 00:45:43.270
Great questions.

00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:44.570
Great questions.

00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:49.550

of the Library of Congress.
