00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.890
- This program is presented by

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.310
University of California Television.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.660
Like what you learn?

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.940
Visit our website or follow
us on Facebook and Twitter

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.653
to keep up with the latest UCTV programs.

00:00:20.517 --> 00:00:23.100
(upbeat music)

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.650
- Thank you for coming this afternoon.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.660
My name is Paula Varsano
and I'm a professor

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.530
of East Asian languages
and cultures and the chair

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.980
of the Foerster Lectures Committee.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.950
We, along with the graduate council,

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.690
are very, very happy to
present V.S. Ramachandran,

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.923
this year's speaker in the
Foerster Lecture Series.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.810
I'm also very pleased to tell you a bit

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.480
about how the endowment
supporting the Foerster lectures

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.110
on the immortality of the
soul came to UC Berkeley.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.100
It's actually a story
that really exemplifies

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.710
the ways in which this campus is linked

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.570
to the history of California

00:01:26.817 --> 00:01:28.740
and in particular to the Bay Area.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.110
In 1928, Miss Edith Zweybruck established

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.412
the Foerster Lectureship
to honor the memory

00:01:35.412 --> 00:01:38.508
of Agnes A. Foerster and her husband,

00:01:38.508 --> 00:01:41.540
Constantine E. Foerster.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.210
Edith was a public school teacher

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.200
for many years in San Francisco.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.280
And the teaching profession, in her eyes,

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.000
was the perfect opportunity
to develop a true knowledge

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.150
and love of the spiritual values of life

00:01:56.406 --> 00:01:59.230
in the young minds entrusted to her care.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.430
Edith's beloved sister, Agnes A. Foerster

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.910
shared her high ideals and her hopes,

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.440
as did Agnes' husband, Constantine.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.440
A lawyer by profession, he was a man

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.610
of high intellectual achievements

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.170
and of rare personal charm.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.090
Although he passed away at the age of 37,

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.960
he had achieved an enviable
place at the San Francisco Bar

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.783
as one of its most
highly respected members.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.020
For several years prior to his death,

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.690
Foerster was a law
partner of none other than

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.940
Alexander F. Morrison,
one of the most prominent

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.953
of San Francisco attorneys, for whom

00:02:42.953 --> 00:02:47.430
our Morrison Memorial Library is named.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.730
In her last days, Miss
Edith Zweybruck expressed

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.920
her deep and abiding interest
in the spiritual life

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.030
by creating this lecture series

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.593
on the subject of the
immortality of the soul.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.830
She believed that through the
medium of great universities

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.330
and the words of scholarly lecturers

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.940
she might shed new light upon a subject

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.530
that has interested the
world for centuries.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.100
So we have to thank Edith Zweybruck.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.670
And now about our lecturer.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.641
Sometimes the best way
to characterize a person

00:03:19.641 --> 00:03:22.230
is to consider what kinds of questions

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.560
he or she likes to ask.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.650
And here's a question
that is always being asked

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.440
in various ways by our speaker.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.360
And I quote him here.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.690
How can a three pound mass of jelly

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.110
that you can hold in the palm of your hand

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.970
imagine angels, contemplate
the meaning of infinity,

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.163
and even question its
own place in the cosmos?

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.290
Now, what kind of person
can ask this question

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.820
in a way that doesn't sound rhetorical?

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.183
Poets can do that.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.580
And Doctor V.S. Ramachandran
is, indeed, a poet of sorts.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.680
Officially, however, he
serves as the director

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.400
of the Center for Brain and Cognition

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.160
and is a distinguished professor

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.670
at the University of California,
San Diego, as well as

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.903
an adjunct professor of
biology at the Salk Institute.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.440
He has also been called the
Marco Polo of neuroscience

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.960
by Richard Dawkins,

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.763
and the modern Paul Brokaw by Eric Kendau.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.830
But as pithily impressive as
these titles and these epithets

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.930
may be, they actually do very, very little

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.690
to reveal the mind-teasing
pathway he has followed

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.850
and on which he leads us
in the work that he does,

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.313
and in the contributions that he makes.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.310
Doctor Ramachandran is renowned
for his ongoing inquiry

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.320
into the field of cognitive neuroscience

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.530
that is the intersection of neurology

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.480
and perceptual psychology.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.160
To steal a few words from the
title of one of his books,

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.550
he is actually a neuroscientist on a quest

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.623
for what makes us human.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.670
Building on his early
work on visual perception,

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.720
Ramachandran has led
pioneering experiments

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.450
in behavioral neurology,
taking cues from malfunctions

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.640
in perception, including
phantom limbs, synesthesia,

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.210
and xenomelia, to delve
into the unique ways

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.180
in which the human brain forms and deforms

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.470
the workings of mind.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.260
Laypeople are perhaps most familiar

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.130
with his controversial
assertion of mirror neurons

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:40.130
as playing a central role in
the unique evolution of humans.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.400
His approach to neurology has been

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.520
to revisit classic syndromes,

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.910
bring them to the lab, determine
their broader significance,

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.433
and devise new treatments where possible.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.810
Of course, Ramachandran, many of you know,

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.330
is a very prolific author,

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.710
and he's published over 180
papers in scientific journals,

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.000
five of which were invited review articles

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.910
for Scientific American.

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.457
He's the co-author with Sandra Blakely of

00:06:08.457 --> 00:06:11.530
"Phantoms in the Brain, 1999,"

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.380
which has been translated
into nine languages,

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.840
and formed the basis for a PBS special.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.070
His BBC Reith lectures
were published in 2003

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.610
in a volume titled "The Emerging Mind,"

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.370
and were dubbed by the
Nobel Laureate David Hubel

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.910
as bold, irreverent,
original, and ingenious.

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.570
His latest book, a New
York Times bestseller,

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.567
is "The Telltale Brain."

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.890
After training as a physician
in Stanley Medical College

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:45.170
in Madras, India,
Ramachandran attained a PhD

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.680
from Trinity College and
the University of Cambridge.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.770
He's an honorary fellow of the
Royal College of Physicians,

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:55.940
London, and the recipient
of two honorary doctorates.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.380
Ramachandran has received many accolades

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:59.670
throughout his career.

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:03.920
He was awarded the
Henry Dale Medal in 2005

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.942
and was elected to an
honorary life membership

00:07:06.942 --> 00:07:10.780
to the Royal Institution of Great Britain.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.390
The president of India conferred on him

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:17.210
the highest honorific title in India,

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.513
Padma Bhushan, in 2007.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:24.420
And besides the BBC Reith
lectures he delivered in the UK,

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.823
he also gave the Gifford
Lectures in Scotland.

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:32.860
Time Magazine named him one
of the most influential people

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.133
in the world in their 2011 Time 100.

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:42.150
Finally, before I cede the
stage to Doctor Ramachandran,

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.850
I would like to leave you with
a few words by Ted Cruiser,

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:50.470
US Poet Laureate from 2004 to 2006,

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:54.050
who also asks what makes us human.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:57.218
He words it differently though,
and much more mournfully

00:07:57.218 --> 00:08:00.260
than our speaker does.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.660
Here we will not find the mind's brain

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:07.550
imagining angels or contemplating
the meaning of infinity.

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:10.167
In the closing lines of Cruiser's poem

00:08:10.167 --> 00:08:13.880
"In the Hall of Bones,"
after cataloging the array

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.480
of skeletons that he
found in what seems to be

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:20.133
a natural history museum,
he writes these words:

00:08:21.327 --> 00:08:23.957
"And then, here's man,

00:08:23.957 --> 00:08:26.167
"all matchsticks, wooden spoons,

00:08:26.167 --> 00:08:29.077
"and tongue depressors, wired together.

00:08:29.077 --> 00:08:33.777
"A rack supporting a leaky
jug of lust and worry.

00:08:33.777 --> 00:08:36.617
"Of all the skeletons assembled here,

00:08:36.617 --> 00:08:40.897
"this is the only one in
which once throbbed a heart

00:08:40.897 --> 00:08:44.560
"made sad by brooding on its shadow."

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:49.135
It's my pleasure to welcome
Doctor Ramachandran to Berkeley.

00:08:49.135 --> 00:08:52.302
(audience applauding)

00:09:01.311 --> 00:09:03.320
- Well thank you for that
amazing introduction.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.050
I'm delighted to be here
and honored to be invited

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:09.200
by the committee to do this
lecture, Foerster Lecture.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.760
When the committee first phoned
me up about this and said

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.330
I was to talk about the soul,
the immortality of the soul,

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.156
I said, "Well, that's
easy, I'm happy to do it."

00:09:17.156 --> 00:09:18.885
(audience laughing)

00:09:18.885 --> 00:09:19.718
And then I did a double take

00:09:19.718 --> 00:09:22.330
and I realized what I was getting into.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.540
But then fortunately they
reassured me that in fact,

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.887
it doesn't have to be anything
directly related to the soul,

00:09:26.887 --> 00:09:29.210
but so long as it's tangentially relevant,

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:31.673
which means essentially all
phenomena in the universe.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.426
So I'm gonna approach
the problem of the soul

00:09:35.426 --> 00:09:36.650
not so much the soul but the self.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:38.370
It's after all the immortality of the self

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.201
that we're all concerned about.

00:09:40.201 --> 00:09:41.440
We call it the soul.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.423
And I'm gonna use two approaches.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:47.290
Mainly one approach,
but I'm not gonna deal

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:48.670
with the metaphysical question of soul,

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:51.370
which is extensively dealt
with in Indian philosophy

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:54.240
and in Western philosophy as well...

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:59.390
But if you sort of pause
and introspect on the self,

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.430
there are many attributes,
it's kind of common sense,

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:04.080
but roughly speaking, there's embodiment.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.707
One of the most obvious
aspects of the self

00:10:05.707 --> 00:10:07.410
is, it's you're anchored in one body.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:10.150
I'm not anchored in Tony's
body, I'm right here.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.700
But we'll call that into
question in a minute.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.580
Then there's a sense of
continuity in space and time.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.270
You all have a calendar.

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:18.810
Sense of agency.

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:20.470
Sort of like the free will.

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:22.920
Sense of unity and coherence,
despite a diversity

00:10:24.089 --> 00:10:26.350
of sense impressions and
memories over a lifetime.

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:27.370
You feel like one person.

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:30.722
I'm one guy, one name, one
bank account, one spouse,

00:10:30.722 --> 00:10:32.633
so on and so forth.

00:10:33.822 --> 00:10:37.140
And a sense of privacy and individuality.

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.153
And then finally, most mysterious
of all, self awareness.

00:10:40.153 --> 00:10:41.173
Self is not aware of its self.

00:10:41.173 --> 00:10:42.773
Sort of like an oxymoron.

00:10:43.703 --> 00:10:45.610
There's a curious, recursive quality to it

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:48.200
which is hard to come to grips with.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.080
I'm not gonna talk about all
the attributes of the self.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.250
That would take a whole week.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:55.373
But let's talk about embodiment
and partly about privacy.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.830
And from the point of view,

00:10:57.830 --> 00:10:59.680
cognitive neuroscience and neurology.

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:03.270
And the way we deal with
this, the way we study this,

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:08.270
is by looking at patients.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.370
We can do brain imaging,
it's one thing we do,

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:12.100
but mainly we do
behavioral, old-fashioned,

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.243
19th century behavioral neurology.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.130
We look at patients who
have sustained an injury

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:19.640
or a change in a small part of the brain,

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.400
and then producing characteristic
changes in their behavior

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.410
and trying to correlate
structure and function,

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:27.170
trying to explain the changes
in behavior in terms of

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:30.818
the anatomical organization
of the normal human brain.

00:11:30.818 --> 00:11:34.280
To give you some insight into the question

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.923
of what's mediating that
particular function.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.470
So let me begin with a bang
and talk about a syndrome

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:43.426
which few people even heard of.

00:11:43.426 --> 00:11:45.860
It's called xenomelia.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.270
Xenomelia is the name we gave it,

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:48.850
but it's also known as apotemnophilia,

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:51.300
unpronounceable name but apotemnophilia.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.330
These are first patients...

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.350
I'll mention one example,
second example of it,

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:58.110
dean of an engineering
school who came to see me

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:01.060
at the age of 70, had just
retired at 70 years old,

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:03.190
and he had harbored,
through his entire life,

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:06.440
he'd harbored a secret
urge, as he described it,

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.173
to amputate his own healthy arm.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.620
Going back as far back in
childhood as he can remember.

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.760
He's a perfectly normal
guy in every respect,

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:18.290
not obviously psychotic or
depressed or mentally disturbed,

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:20.477
no neurological findings,
completely normal,

00:12:20.477 --> 00:12:25.020
led a normal family life, had
friends, had a job as a dean.

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:27.540
Everything seemed normal, except
for this one particularity

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:28.860
that he had this urge.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:30.553
And by then I discovered
that many of these people,

00:12:30.553 --> 00:12:34.100
it's not that rare.
It is rare, but not that rare.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.870
And about one third of
them to half of them

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:38.550
go and get it amputated.

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:41.780
This is not some mild
obsession these people have.

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.360
There's few serious clinical consequences,

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.410
the loss of the limb.

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:47.377
So then I said, "Why
did you come to see me?

00:12:47.377 --> 00:12:50.867
"Do you want us to treat you or cure you?"

00:12:50.867 --> 00:12:53.487
He said, "No, I enjoy it,
I don't wanna be cured.

00:12:53.487 --> 00:12:55.377
"I want you to remove
the arm, give me a letter

00:12:55.377 --> 00:12:56.210
"so I can go get it removed.

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:58.387
"And I can't do it here in this country.

00:12:58.387 --> 00:12:59.537
"I'll go to Mexico, across the border,

00:12:59.537 --> 00:13:01.840
"it's legal to get a
healthy limb amputated."

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.760
I'm not making this up,
this is what he said.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.160
Later I checked on this and it's true:

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.600
you can get it amputated
in Mexico and in Canada,

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.433
but you can't do it here.

00:13:08.433 --> 00:13:12.580
So many patients travel north
or south to get it amputated.

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:13.413
And what would cause this?

00:13:13.413 --> 00:13:14.519
The first thing (mumbles) is,

00:13:14.519 --> 00:13:16.090
one of the things you learn
in clinical medicine is

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:17.190
first talk to the guy.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.230
You know, 90% of the time you
figure out what's going on

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.570
in his brain by just talking to him.

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:23.540
You don't need to do brain imaging,

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:25.640
you don't need to do
even clinical testing.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.980
I said, "Do you feel like this
arm doesn't belong to you?"

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.187
He said, "No, no it's the opposite.

00:13:31.187 --> 00:13:32.487
"It feels like it over belongs to me.

00:13:32.487 --> 00:13:35.627
"It's intrusive.
"It's intruding itself on me.

00:13:35.627 --> 00:13:36.827
"And I want it removed."

00:13:37.993 --> 00:13:41.420
I said, "Okay," and I
started thinking about this.

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:42.740
And I said, maybe what's gone wrong

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:45.303
is you look at the surface of the brain,

00:13:45.303 --> 00:13:48.180
that's the somatosensory
cortex, so there's one,

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.567
it's called the Penfield
map of the body surface.

00:13:50.567 --> 00:13:52.453
And the entire surface of the body,

00:13:53.346 --> 00:13:56.080
the body skin surface is mapped
onto the post sympathizer...

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.120
There's a vertical cleft going
down the side of the brain

00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.480
called the central surface.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.723
Behind that cleft there's
a vertical strip of cortex,

00:14:01.723 --> 00:14:04.250
it's shown in brown there.

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:05.260
So that'd be the left hemisphere,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:06.600
if you were going to touch my right side,

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.280
closer to that is on the left hemisphere.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.020
There's a complete map
of the body's surface

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.930
on that post-central gyrus there.

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:15.640
That map is shown in the next slide.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.033
Many of you may have seen this before.

00:14:18.033 --> 00:14:20.130
It's got some peculiar features
which I will come back to.

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:21.888
But I said, well maybe in this guy,

00:14:21.888 --> 00:14:24.300
it was a very naive, phrenological hunch,

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:27.320
maybe in this guy that part
of the brain is missing.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.420
The hand is not there.

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:31.780
You don't know how much
of this map is present,

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.150
the scaffolding is present at birth,

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.150
and how much of it is
shaped by experience.

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:37.550
And I'm gonna talk about
that in a few minutes.

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:40.000
But for now, let's assume
it's hardwired, partly.

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.840
Maybe it's congenitally missing the arm,

00:14:43.736 --> 00:14:45.124
and that's why he feels it's alien

00:14:45.124 --> 00:14:46.720
or it doesn't belong to him.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.570
So we did the obvious experiment
of galvanic skin response,

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:51.450
poked him with a needle, gently,

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:52.840
in different parts of the body,

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.036
and obtained electrical
skin conduction responses.

00:14:55.036 --> 00:14:57.880
And we thought we would find no responses.

00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.150
One of the things that clued us in

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:00.760
to this as being a neurological

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.670
rather than a psychological disorder,

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:04.210
if you ask him where did
he want it amputated,

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:07.300
he'd take a felt pen, and
he would draw an exact line

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:08.620
just above the elbow or below the elbow

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.680
or just above the hand.

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:14.080
Very precise line, often
irregular line, sloping line,

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.180
and then if you let him go home,

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:16.290
don't tell him you're gonna retest him,

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:17.470
but bring him back after six months,

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:19.360
he'll draw exactly the same line.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.932
Unless he's being deliberately
deceptive, got it memorized.

00:15:22.932 --> 00:15:23.930
It's very unlikely he's doing that.

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:25.130
So this suggests that...

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:26.490
Why would the precise line matter?

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:28.950
Some vague inclination
to get the arm removed,

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:30.670
why would the precise line matter?

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:32.330
In fact there are many
psychological theories of this.

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.720
One psychiatric theory holds
that it's a cry for attention,

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.420
that's why they want their arm removed.

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:37.970
Why arm?

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:40.697
Why not remove the nose or the
ear or something like that?

00:15:40.697 --> 00:15:44.150
Why the arm always, or the leg, right?

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:46.480
Seems pretty drastic way
of getting attention.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.980
Another theory, believe it or not,

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.456
the Freudian theory, the
guy wants his arm removed

00:15:50.456 --> 00:15:52.970
in order to create an amputation stump,

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:54.443
to resemble the giant penis.

00:15:55.875 --> 00:15:56.708
I'm not making this up.

00:15:56.708 --> 00:15:58.900
You can see this in the literature.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:00.650
So we thought we'd come
up with a neurological,

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:02.220
phrenological theory of what's going on.

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:05.187
Then we drew the line with the felt tip,

00:16:06.676 --> 00:16:08.760
poked him with a needle in
different parts of the body,

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.730
to see if the galvanic
skin response is normal

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:13.280
below the line as opposed
to above the line.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.920
We expected a diminished
galvanic skin response

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.660
below the line, because
that part of the arm

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:22.010
is not represented in the
brain, according to our theory.

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.090
Well we found the opposite.

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:25.180
As often happens in science.

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:26.013
We found below the line

00:16:26.013 --> 00:16:28.000
there's a huge galvanic skin response.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.690
Above the line, is perfectly
normal as you would expect.

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:31.620
Is that clear?

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:33.740
Okay if you poke somebody with a needle,

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:37.720
unless it goes to S1 of course, and S2,

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.240
the somatic representation of the body,

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.820
but it also goes to an area
called the insular cortex,

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:44.318
and from there it gets
into the anterior singular

00:16:44.318 --> 00:16:46.630
and from there messages
cascade down the sympathetic

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:49.870
nervous system, producing
sympathetic arousal to the pain.

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:53.900
And then this manifests as a
change in sweating of the skin,

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:54.820
which in turn can be measured

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:56.160
as a change in skin resistance.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.748
You put two electrodes in the palm

00:16:57.748 --> 00:16:59.760
and I scare you with a
needle or I scare you

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.493
with a lion, you start sweating.

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:05.970
This registers as a
fall in skin resistance.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:07.250
Base of lie detectors.

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:10.000
Any anxiety, any panic
will produce resistance.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.030
So clearly, he was
registering a higher response

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:19.040
to the alienated part of the
limb than to the normal part,

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.340
which is opposite of what we predicted.

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:22.173
But hang on a second.

00:17:22.173 --> 00:17:24.610
So we said, well our basic,
early theory was wrong,

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:25.860
so what's going on here?

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:27.560
Then we resorted to brain imaging.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.650
I don't have any pictures to show you,

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:35.650
but basically what we found
was this map was normal,

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.810
the one I just showed you, S1 is normal.

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:42.810
S2, which represents joints,
muscles, and light touch,

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:44.320
that was also normal.

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.880
We said what's going on here?
Everything's normal.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:50.550
Then we went to in superior
parietal lobule, SPL,

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:54.510
wherever four is, superior parietal lobule

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:57.850
is where you create a
polysensory representation

00:17:57.850 --> 00:17:59.280
of your body image.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.150
You close your eyes, your vivid
impression of your own body,

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:03.610
inhabiting your own body, the movements

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:05.450
of your arms and legs and all that,

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:08.020
that sense which was called
body image by Henry Head

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:11.193
and Lord Russell Brain, two
real neurologists, by the way,

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:14.410
who called this the body image.

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:18.250
And that combined sensation
from hearing, touch, and vision

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:21.073
is in the superior parietal lobule.

00:18:21.073 --> 00:18:24.653
In that map, there is no
response from the hand.

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:28.050
So that map was abnormal.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:29.830
There's a hole, to put it crudely,

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:33.010
corresponding to the
hand he wanted amputated.

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:34.960
So what's going on in this patient is,

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.480
the messages from the hand and arm

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:40.230
are reaching the somatosensory
cortex completely normal.

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:42.370
So the messages, sensory
signals are normal,

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:44.570
sensory cortex is normal, S2 is normal,

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:45.727
but they have nowhere to go to,

00:18:45.727 --> 00:18:48.227
'cause there's a hole in
that region of the brain.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.270
So this creates a discrepancy

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:52.970
between the incoming sensory input

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:54.167
and there's no place for them to go to,

00:18:54.167 --> 00:18:56.120
and the brain aborts discrepancy,

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.500
that signal goes to the insular
and possibly the amygdala,

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:00.907
generating a galvanic skin response.

00:19:00.907 --> 00:19:03.790
(grunts) right?

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:05.620
So here we have an example of...

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:08.420
We've taken the Freudian
theory and discarded it.

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:10.830
By and large, that would
be completely wrong,

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:13.550
and then replaced it with
an anatomical theory,

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:17.240
which we can test in a few
hours using a GSR machine,

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:20.540
and then do more
sophisticated brain imaging

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:21.880
and show that we're on the right track.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.970
This shows the power of this approach,

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:24.970
cognitive neuroscience.

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:27.380
We can take a bizarre,
seemingly incomprehensible

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:30.922
neurological disorder, a
person wanting his arm removed,

00:19:30.922 --> 00:19:33.220
and reject the traditional explanation

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:35.740
in favor of an anatomical explanation

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:36.950
based on the known neuroanatomy

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:41.610
of the sensory pathways in the brain.

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:43.070
Now, can you cure the disorder?

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:44.970
We haven't found a way of treating it yet.

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:47.463
In fact, they don't wanna
be cured, as I said before.

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:51.190
But the next topic I'm gonna deal with...

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:53.400
So this is typical of what we do.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.120
We take syndromes that have
been known for a long time,

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.410
either rare ones or common ones,

00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:57.880
like synesthesia is very common.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:00.450
I'm gonna talk about that later today.

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:01.600
Phantom limbs are quite common,

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.140
I'll talk about that as well.

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.130
Our rare ones, and bring
them from the clinic

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:08.960
to the laboratory and then
do systematic experiments,

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:09.793
to find out what's going on,

00:20:09.793 --> 00:20:12.930
and sometimes we're actually
able to help the patient.

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:14.720
Now this at the start
it doesn't always work,

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:15.883
looking for anomalies.

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:17.733
Because every now and then...

00:20:17.733 --> 00:20:19.250
You only hear of the success stories.

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:21.500
Nine out of 10 times
it's a wild goose chase.

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:23.480
Anomalies in neurology.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:27.330
Neurology and psychiatry are
full of anomalous syndromes.

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:28.960
Nine out 10 times a wild goose chase.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.660
You only hear of the success stories.

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:33.140
I'll give you three examples
of wild goose chases.

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:34.220
Very briefly.

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:38.711
There's a syndrome called
De Clerambault Syndrome.

00:20:38.711 --> 00:20:40.643
How many of you know about
De Clerambault Syndrome?

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:42.940
Nobody.
See?

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:43.840
Pretty obscure.

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:46.020
Even most neuro and psychiatrists
haven't heard of it.

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:48.540
It refers to a syndrome that's defined as,

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:50.520
it's accepted in psychiatry textbooks,

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.770
a young woman, typically young woman,

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:57.300
who develops the delusion
that an old, rich, famous man

00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.039
is madly in love with her
but is in denial about it.

00:21:00.039 --> 00:21:03.060
(audience laughing)

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:04.317
Funnily enough, the
converse of the syndrome

00:21:04.317 --> 00:21:07.010
has not been described,
where an older gentleman

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:08.790
develops a delusion that a young hottie

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:12.330
is sexually interested in him,
but is in denial about it.

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:14.299
This is much more
common, I can assure you.

00:21:14.299 --> 00:21:17.113
(audience laughing)

00:21:17.113 --> 00:21:20.843
Another bogus syndrome is chronic
underachievement syndrome.

00:21:21.853 --> 00:21:22.710
This is actually found in textbooks.

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:24.320
Chronic underachievement syndrome.

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.428
My day it used to be called stupidity.

00:21:26.428 --> 00:21:28.820
(audience laughing)

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:30.560
The third syndrome, my favorite,

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.713
is oppositional defiant disorder, ODD.

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:35.760
This young spirited youngster

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.892
daring to challenge the establishment.

00:21:37.892 --> 00:21:42.020
The psychiatrist challenged her parent...

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:43.890
The man who invented
the syndrome is genius,

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:46.680
because any attempt by the
patient to disprove the syndrome,

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.290
the pretend syndrome, can be construed

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:50.340
as additional evidence for the diagnosis.

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:54.260
Leaving that aside, every now and then

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:55.590
you stumble on legitimate syndromes

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:56.670
that give you key insights.

00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:59.036
So for example, apotemnophilia.

00:21:59.036 --> 00:22:00.060
Now I'm gonna talk about something else,

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:01.450
this you heard before, many of you,

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:04.000
but I'm gonna repeat it, the gist of it.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.250
Phantom limbs.

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:07.810
An arm or leg were amputated
and you continue to feel

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:10.170
its presence is called a phantom limb.

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:11.610
Some years ago, nearly 15 years ago

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:13.017
we had a patient with a left arm amputated

00:22:13.017 --> 00:22:15.210
and we made a specific prediction

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:19.810
based on work on monkeys run
by Mike Merzenich and others.

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:21.410
So nobody had tested it on humans,

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:23.470
so we had a patient sitting in my lab,

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:25.750
whose left arm had been amputated,

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:27.520
we blindfolded him and simply took a Q-tip

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.200
and touched different parts of his body,

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.050
and asked him, "What do you feel?"

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:32.260
He said, "It's my right
shoulder, and my chest."

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:35.180
So here's a patient sitting
in the chair, blindfolded,

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:37.147
took a Q-tip, touched
different parts of his body,

00:22:37.147 --> 00:22:39.467
did a routine sensory neurological exam.

00:22:39.467 --> 00:22:40.300
"What's that?"

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:41.133
"That's a Q-tip."

00:22:41.133 --> 00:22:41.966
"What are you touching?"

00:22:41.966 --> 00:22:43.687
"Right chest."

00:22:43.687 --> 00:22:45.933
"That's my right shoulder,
my left shoulder.

00:22:47.987 --> 00:22:48.993
"Left upper arm.

00:22:50.277 --> 00:22:52.823
"Oh my god you're touching
my left phantom thumb.

00:22:54.437 --> 00:22:57.780
"And my phantom pinky, and
my phantom index finger."

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:00.155
We found there's a complete
map of the missing arm

00:23:00.155 --> 00:23:03.033
on the face, and you can
actually plot receptor fields.

00:23:04.802 --> 00:23:06.550
You can plot receptor fields.

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:07.867
Like the thumb was there.

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:12.270
Ball of the thumb, index finger, pinky.

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:14.110
And you can send him home,
bring him back after a month

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:15.410
and it's exactly the same.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.193
No way he could've memorized that.

00:23:19.625 --> 00:23:20.700
And why is this going on, happening?

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:22.650
Well we can do a bit of detective work.

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:25.623
Go back to the Penfield map.

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:30.793
Notice that the map is completely,

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:34.550
as a map should be, continuous,

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:38.220
except for one fact: the
face is not near the head,

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:40.050
where it's supposed to be, near the neck,

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:41.850
it's below the hand.
Is that clear?

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.010
So we said, what's going on?

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:44.843
And when you amputate the arm,

00:23:44.843 --> 00:23:48.210
these sensory signals don't
get to be handed in the brain.

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:51.240
Signals from the face can
normally go into the face area,

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:53.730
invade, and cross and invade the territory

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:55.130
vacated by the missing hand.

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:58.070
So there's this cross-wiring.

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:00.828
You ignore the arm and the hand,

00:24:00.828 --> 00:24:03.230
there are no signals coming
to this region of the brain,

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:04.190
the hand region.

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:06.320
That region's hungry
for new sensory input.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.090
The sensory input not coming from the face

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:10.370
came to the face area,
invades the territory

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:12.660
corresponding to the missing
hand, activates the cells,

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:14.300
and those cells misinterpret the signals

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:16.300
as coming from the missing phantom hand.

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:17.180
So when you touch the face

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:18.793
he thinks you're touching his hand.

00:24:20.043 --> 00:24:21.680
So you can have fun with this.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.870
We took a Q-tip and put
it in ice-cold water

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:25.187
and put it on his face, and he said,

00:24:25.187 --> 00:24:27.350
"Oh my god, my thumb
feels ice-cold, doctor."

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:29.070
So the reorganization
is morality-specific,

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:30.800
it's not higgledy-piggledy.

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:34.110
Touch goes to touch, warm goes
to warm, cold goes to cold.

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:37.200
On one occasion, water started
trickling down his face,

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.147
accidentally, and he said,

00:24:38.147 --> 00:24:40.120
"Oh my god, I can feel
the trickle of the water!"

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:42.200
And he took his other hand, normal hand,

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.877
and followed the trickle,
"It's coming down here,

00:24:43.877 --> 00:24:47.260
"it's coming down here, oh
it stops here at the wrist."

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:48.500
Where the water stopped.

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:51.240
So it's exquisitely
precise, the reorganization.

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.357
Just for fun I said,

00:24:52.357 --> 00:24:55.140
"Raise your stump and
point to the ceiling."

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:56.750
The phantom is pointed
to the ceiling, upward.

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:59.040
Then I put the water here,
started trickling down,

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.090
I said, "What do you feel?"

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:02.277
He said, "Oh my god the
water is trickling upwards,

00:25:02.277 --> 00:25:04.400
"defying the laws of gravity."

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.480
You knew the patients
often enough, you realize

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.523
that they don't make up stories like that.

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:13.810
Alright, I can continue along these.

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:16.250
I'm running out of time soon,
I'm gonna skip a lot of stuff.

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:18.000
Can do brain imaging to
show the reorganization

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.173
has indeed occurred.

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:23.750
The other interesting thing
about phantom limbs is,

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:26.433
the patient can often move the phantom.

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:28.939
Majority of patients can move the phantom.

00:25:28.939 --> 00:25:29.772
But about a third of them,

00:25:29.772 --> 00:25:31.600
the phantom is fixed or immobilized.

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.650
And often in a painful position.

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:35.900
The patient will say,
mimic the phantom positions

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:38.820
with his normal hand and will
say, "It's like this, doctor."

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:39.967
Occupying it's like this.

00:25:39.967 --> 00:25:42.497
"My hand is extending, hyper-extending,

00:25:42.497 --> 00:25:45.817
"so my knuckles are touching
the back of my wrist.

00:25:45.817 --> 00:25:47.680
"It's anatomically impossible,
but my hand is doing it."

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.160
And it's like that
movie, what is the movie?

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.641
Where the head spins around?

00:25:51.641 --> 00:25:52.474
(audience member mumbles)

00:25:52.474 --> 00:25:53.980
Yeah, so it's anatomically impossible

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:55.007
and it's excruciatingly painful,

00:25:55.007 --> 00:25:56.247
"I wish I could straighten my wrist

00:25:56.247 --> 00:25:57.507
"and the pain will go away."

00:25:57.507 --> 00:25:58.567
"So why don't you try?"

00:25:58.567 --> 00:26:01.267
"I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm
sweating, I can't do it."

00:26:02.105 --> 00:26:06.150
I'm gonna cut a long story
short, we hit on the idea

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:10.190
of putting a mirror there
and showing the reflection

00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:11.660
of the mirror, we can go into detail

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:14.340
during the question and answer later,

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:17.290
put a mirror inside a cardboard box,

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:20.130
and the phantom, the clenched phantom,

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:23.163
often they will say, "The
fingers are biting into the...

00:26:23.163 --> 00:26:24.773
"The nails are biting
into the palm, doctor,

00:26:24.773 --> 00:26:26.300
"and it's excruciatingly painful."

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:27.568
There's no nails, there's
no palm, there's no hand.

00:26:27.568 --> 00:26:28.473
It's a phantom.

00:26:30.242 --> 00:26:31.270
It's a serious clinical problem.

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:33.400
Become profoundly
depressed, lose their jobs,

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.250
on occasion they contemplate suicide.

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:38.740
So you put a mirror there
and you have the patient

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:41.250
clench the normal hand
and look at the reflection

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:42.970
of the normal hand in the mirror

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:44.660
so that the reflection of the normal hand

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:46.890
is superimposed optically
on the phantom hand,

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:48.890
so you visually resurrected the phantom.

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:52.147
Then you say, "Okay send
symmetrical commands

00:26:52.147 --> 00:26:54.130
"to both hands to open or close."

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:56.087
He says, "I know you're
telling me that I can do that,

00:26:56.087 --> 00:26:58.470
"my left hand, it will not open."

00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:01.430
I said, "Just take a look
in the mirror and see."

00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:02.507
He said, "Oh my god it
looks like it's opening.

00:27:02.507 --> 00:27:04.197
"And my god it also
feels like it's opening,

00:27:04.197 --> 00:27:05.960
"it doesn't merely look
like it's opening."

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.020
Which is not surprising, it's optics.

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:09.510
But it feels like it's opening,

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:11.330
and the clenching spasm is removed,

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:12.730
it's gone, the pain is gone.

00:27:13.851 --> 00:27:14.902
Then I said, "Remove the mirror."

00:27:14.902 --> 00:27:15.735
I removed the mirror.

00:27:15.735 --> 00:27:16.767
Then try with your eyes
closed and imagine it, and,

00:27:16.767 --> 00:27:19.180
"No it doesn't work, I keep
trying but it doesn't work."

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:20.127
Put the mirror and then,

00:27:20.127 --> 00:27:22.577
"Wow, it's opening, it's
opening, it feels good."

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:25.874
So I said, "Well, maybe...

00:27:25.874 --> 00:27:28.737
"You can't carry around
a mirror all the time.

00:27:28.737 --> 00:27:31.457
"Maybe you can get to a
point where you can practice

00:27:31.457 --> 00:27:33.077
"with the mirror one hour a day,

00:27:33.077 --> 00:27:34.872
"and after about a week or two or a month,

00:27:34.872 --> 00:27:36.757
"you can dispense with the mirror,

00:27:36.757 --> 00:27:38.720
"you can just move it on its own."

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.530
He can just unclench it
whenever he wants to.

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:42.480
So I sent him home with a box, only $2,

00:27:43.322 --> 00:27:44.950
sent him home with a box.

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:46.157
And then after two weeks I phoned him up

00:27:46.157 --> 00:27:47.420
and I said, "Have you been practicing?"

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:48.707
He said, "Yes I've been practicing.

00:27:48.707 --> 00:27:50.807
"When I keep my eyes open,
the pain gets relieved

00:27:50.807 --> 00:27:52.857
"for about an hour, and then it comes back

00:27:52.857 --> 00:27:53.897
"with a vengeance.

00:27:53.897 --> 00:27:56.477
"And then I put the mirror
back and it goes back again.

00:27:56.477 --> 00:27:58.487
"So I keep doing refills.

00:27:58.487 --> 00:28:01.130
"I know you want it to go away
permanently, but it doesn't."

00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:03.610
I said, "Fine, c'est la vie, you know?"

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:04.800
Then after a week he phones me,

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.173
and he's all agitated on the phone.

00:28:06.173 --> 00:28:07.006
I said, "What's wrong, Derek?"

00:28:07.006 --> 00:28:08.470
He said, "You're not gonna believe this."

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:09.634
I said, "What?"

00:28:09.634 --> 00:28:11.080
"It's gone," he says.

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:11.913
I said, "What's gone?"

00:28:11.913 --> 00:28:13.410
I thought maybe the box was gone.

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:15.557
He said, "No, no, no, not the box.

00:28:15.557 --> 00:28:19.117
"The phantom limb which I've
had for the last 13 years.

00:28:19.117 --> 00:28:21.750
"The phantom limb is
gone, it's disappeared."

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:23.270
I said, "What do you mean?"

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:24.350
He said, "It's gone."

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:25.183
I said, "When?"

00:28:25.183 --> 00:28:26.187
"Like three days ago.

00:28:26.187 --> 00:28:27.910
"I've been trying to reach you."

00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:29.130
And I was a bit worried about this

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:30.380
because human subjects and ethics,

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:32.860
because I've permanently
modified this guy's body image,

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:34.930
if what he's saying is true.

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:36.020
Then I said, "Well does it bother you?"

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:37.337
He said, "No, the pain that I had

00:28:37.337 --> 00:28:38.827
"in my phantom elbow, my phantom wrist,

00:28:38.827 --> 00:28:41.347
"and my phantom fingers,
I've never had those pains.

00:28:41.347 --> 00:28:43.557
"In the last three days
I don't have a phantom."

00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:47.150
We can go into the question
of why this happens later,

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:49.640
but clinically, this has been tried

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:50.930
in several clinical trials,

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:52.970
one in the New England
Journal of Medicine,

00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:54.400
so you can see the...

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:57.060
Published in the New
England Journal of Medicine

00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:58.530
from Walter Reed.

00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:00.973
You can see with the mirror
they say the pain drops

00:29:00.973 --> 00:29:03.728
to almost no pain.

00:29:03.728 --> 00:29:06.730
With the covered mirror and visual imagery

00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:09.210
the pain actually goes up
until they crossed over

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:11.632
and then the pain drops
again in the mirror.

00:29:11.632 --> 00:29:14.282
And now it's widely used in
clinics around the world.

00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:20.940
Now, surprising, curing
pain in a phantom limb

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:22.920
with a mirror is surprising enough.

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.420
Now as you see there's
a lot of variability.

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:26.760
Only about half the patients are helped.

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:28.540
In about half of them
the mirror does nothing,

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:30.680
typically patients who've
seen them for a long time.

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:32.980
These variables need to be studied.

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:34.740
There's another disorder which
I want to tell you about.

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:36.550
Speaking of mind and body and Lekov here

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:38.850
has done more than anybody
else to talk about links

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:40.340
between mind and body.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:43.190
But here is a powerful
example you see in the clinic.

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:44.980
Ordinarily we think of pain as one thing.

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:46.378
But there's in fact two kinds of pain.

00:29:46.378 --> 00:29:48.230
There's chronic pain and acute pain.

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:50.250
Acute pain, you touch the
kettle and you withdraw

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:52.030
to prevent further tissue injury.

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:53.590
Obvious adaptive value.

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:55.710
Chronic pain is the opposite.

00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:56.960
Immobilize the arm.

00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.281
You've a tiny metacarpal bone fracture,

00:29:59.281 --> 00:30:02.520
and your finger becomes
painful, immobilized,

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:05.580
there's a reflex immobilization
to prevent further injury

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:08.250
to the finger, and it gets swollen

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:11.040
and it gets inflamed and it
gets warm and it gets red.

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.260
All signs, it remains swollen, warm, red,

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:14.573
painful, and inflamed.

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.410
And then the bone heals after two weeks,

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:21.840
all the change is reversed,
the inflammation subsides,

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.870
pain goes away, the finger
starts moving again.

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:26.380
That's normal, 99% of people.

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:28.983
In about one or two percent of
people that does not happen.

00:30:28.983 --> 00:30:32.182
The injury heals, the
bone heals, in x-ray,

00:30:32.182 --> 00:30:34.680
but the pain persists with a vengeance.

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:37.250
It continues to be immobilized, paralyzed.

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:40.223
It gets swollen, it gets warm.

00:30:41.323 --> 00:30:43.367
Normally then it spreads
to the entire hand.

00:30:43.367 --> 00:30:45.110
Entire hand gets warm, swollen,

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:46.980
painful, immobilized, paralyzed.

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:49.410
Entire arm gets paralyzed,
swollen, immobilized,

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:52.490
from the starting from the
little metacarpal bone fracture.

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:53.650
So what's going on here?

00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:55.700
I don't know.
We still don't know.

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:57.560
But one thing, the paralysis
I think is partly due

00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:58.860
to what we call learned paralysis.

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:00.730
Every time you attempted
to move this finger,

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:03.749
move the arm, brain was sending a single,

00:31:03.749 --> 00:31:06.160
"Ouch, it's painful, stop moving it."

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.000
So there's a habean link
between the very attempt

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.300
to move the hand and
the excruciating pain.

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:12.300
So the brain gives up and
says "Stop moving your hand."

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:15.713
So you get this pseudo-paralysis
arising from punishment.

00:31:16.686 --> 00:31:17.750
So we said, "How do you cure this?"

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:20.203
Well let's put a mirror here, of course.

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:22.600
And put the other hand there,

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.100
and send a symmetrical command,

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:26.350
you're gonna get a visual
illusion that the paralyzed,

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:29.280
swollen, painful hand is
actually moving with impunity.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.706
But he's not actually moving it.

00:31:30.706 --> 00:31:32.930
There's an optical twin that's moving.

00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:35.170
He's seeing the reflection
of his normal hand moving.

00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:38.590
But with that unlearned the
learned pain phenomenon.

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:41.373
But this is a wild hunch,
even by my standards,

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:44.327
and we're setting out to do it,

00:31:44.327 --> 00:31:45.860
fortunately another group did it,

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:49.890
Halligan, Marshall and Wall, in England.

00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:50.930
And they...

00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:54.133
That shows you an example of RSD.

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:02.213
They did a similar
experiment with a mirror

00:32:02.213 --> 00:32:04.350
and found dramatic recovery.

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:06.353
In fact, what's astonishing is,

00:32:06.353 --> 00:32:08.090
when you put the mirror there...

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:10.340
Here's a guy for months he's been swollen

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:13.500
and paralyzed and inflamed and painful.

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:16.130
He moves the normal hand, in a few minutes

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:18.860
the inflammation stops, not only the pain,

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:23.090
but the mobility returns and
the swelling starts subsiding.

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:24.020
And the temperature starts falling.

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:25.863
You can't fake a fallen temperature.

00:32:26.766 --> 00:32:28.920
So that convinced me that it was real.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.030
And then when I saw one of
the authors was Patrick Wall,

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:33.050
who's the world's leading expert on pain,

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:34.940
he's experimented on placebos as well,

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:36.070
so his name was in the papers,

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:37.984
I figured this must be a real phenomenon.

00:32:37.984 --> 00:32:39.700
Since then, there's been

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:42.270
about four or five controlled studies,

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:43.103
there's been blind controlled studies,

00:32:43.103 --> 00:32:45.660
placebo controlled studies,
also now it's the accepted

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:48.162
first line of approach treating RSD

00:32:48.162 --> 00:32:49.870
in clinics around the world.

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:51.230
It's an extraordinary example to me

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:53.260
of mind-body interaction.

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:56.000
That a mirror is producing changes...

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.820
Vascular changes in sympathetic pain,

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:02.583
changes in swelling, all of
it, temperature, all of that.

00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:04.773
All online.

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:08.470
It's also being used for
stroke by the way now,

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:11.510
mirror rehab, and also for neglect,

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:13.890
which I won't go into
now, for a lack of time.

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:16.873
Now just when I thought I
was done with phantom limbs,

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.600
I came across another phenomenon.

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:23.070
I started reading Rizzolatti's
work on mirror neurons.

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:25.179
I speculated on this,

00:33:25.179 --> 00:33:27.920
and jumped off my seat when
I first heard the talk.

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.246
Everybody here knows about mirror neurons,

00:33:29.246 --> 00:33:31.180
especially here in Berkeley.

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:32.860
They're neurons in the front of the brain,

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:37.370
prefrontal cortex, roughly
homologous to Brocal's area, B5.

00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:39.470
These neurons normally
are the garden-variety

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:42.490
motor command neurons which
when a monkey or a person

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:46.230
reaches out and grabs a
peanut, a neuron fires,

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:48.730
orchestrating the series of motor twitches

00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:50.380
required for grabbing the peanut.

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:54.340
About 10% of these
neurons Rizzolatti found.

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:56.700
They'll also fire when I watch George here

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:58.360
reaching out and grabbing a peanut.

00:33:58.360 --> 00:33:59.710
They've been quickly dubbed

00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:02.403
monkey see, monkey do
neuron, or mirror neurons.

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:05.760
So they're sort of simulating
doing a virtual reality

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:08.403
simulation of your impending
action, is the claim.

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:13.640
Now, there's also sensory mirror neurons,

00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:14.473
they're equally interesting.

00:34:14.473 --> 00:34:18.604
Discovered by Christian Kaiser
in S2, the sensory cortex.

00:34:18.604 --> 00:34:19.437
Remember I showed you the map

00:34:19.437 --> 00:34:20.990
of the sensory areas of the brain.

00:34:21.837 --> 00:34:24.070
When you touch my left hand,

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:26.910
right somatosensory cortex,
S1, S2 cells are activated,

00:34:26.910 --> 00:34:28.340
there's a map.

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:29.580
This has been known for a long time

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:33.480
since Lord Adrian, goes
back 70 to 100 years.

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:36.700
Now, a subset of these
neurons, about 10% of them

00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:39.823
will react to my watching
George's thumb being touched.

00:34:40.990 --> 00:34:42.033
So this is very interesting

00:34:42.033 --> 00:34:44.100
because we can call them empathy neurons.

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:46.789
Because the neuron is effectively saying,

00:34:46.789 --> 00:34:48.990
what's happening to George is similar

00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:51.180
to what would happen to you
if your thumb were touched.

00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:52.370
So empathize with George,

00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:54.000
you know what it's like to feel his touch.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.590
Same thing with pain, you
go to anterior singular,

00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:57.390
there are neurons sensitive to pain.

00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:59.300
If you poke my thumb with a needle,

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:02.080
it goes to my anterior
singular and I say, "Ouch."

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:04.680
But if you poke George's
thumb with a needle,

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:06.150
a subset of the same neurons fire

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:09.300
and I can empathize with George.

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:11.210
But here's an interesting question:

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:13.890
Wouldn't I shout, "Ouch" when
he's poked with a needle?

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:15.270
The same neurons are firing.

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:16.480
Wouldn't I withdraw my hand

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:19.163
and I will simply watch
George's hand being poked?

00:35:21.065 --> 00:35:22.630
A couple of possibilities.

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:23.970
One possibility, obvious possibility,

00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:26.400
is I wear my normal skin
sending a veto signal

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.687
saying, "Don't worry, you're
not actually being poked.

00:35:28.687 --> 00:35:30.127
"Empathize with George, by all means,

00:35:30.127 --> 00:35:31.577
"but don't dissolve into him.

00:35:33.137 --> 00:35:34.317
"Don't withdraw your hand suddenly

00:35:34.317 --> 00:35:38.249
"because that's maladaptive,
it'd be a waste of time.

00:35:38.249 --> 00:35:41.517
"So empathize with him, know
what it's like to be George,

00:35:41.517 --> 00:35:43.007
"in George's shoes right now,

00:35:43.007 --> 00:35:45.710
"but don't withdraw your
hand, that would be foolish."

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:46.730
So I looked at this and I said,

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:48.927
"Well the obvious prediction
is if I amputate my arm

00:35:48.927 --> 00:35:50.467
"and look at George being poked,

00:35:50.467 --> 00:35:53.394
"I should feel the pain in my phantom."

00:35:53.394 --> 00:35:55.090
Because the afferent signals are gone.

00:35:55.090 --> 00:35:55.923
There's no veto signal.

00:35:55.923 --> 00:35:57.423
Is that clear or obscure?

00:35:58.770 --> 00:35:59.720
So in the hundred years

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:01.440
that we've known about phantom limbs,

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.630
nobody answers this question.

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:04.630
If you poke somebody with a needle

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:06.100
when a phantom limb patient is watching,

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:07.740
does he feel the poke in his phantom?

00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:08.573
The answer is yes.

00:36:08.573 --> 00:36:10.530
We've seen in three patients now,

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:12.300
they watch another patient being poked,

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:14.163
they feel the pain in their phantom.

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:18.145
So we call these empathy
neurons or Gandhi neurons.

00:36:18.145 --> 00:36:20.180
(audience laughing)

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:22.280
Now there's some debate about

00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:25.330
whether mirror neurons are significant,

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:28.310
whether they're important or
the same mysteria of the minds,

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:31.050
action understanding action, production,

00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:33.130
all of this, just is it
old-fashioned psychology,

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:36.380
new words to describe
empathy and things like that.

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:37.800
We won't go into that.

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:40.990
This patient went home
and he had a smart idea

00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:43.590
and we talked about it
before he went home.

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:46.720
He feels excruciating phantom
pain in his phantom arm,

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:48.360
cramped, phantom cramping pain.

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:49.610
He can't do anything about it.

00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:50.920
We were already getting ready to start him

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:52.951
on the mirror protocol, before that

00:36:52.951 --> 00:36:56.563
he simply watched his
wife's hand being massaged.

00:36:58.030 --> 00:37:00.090
And of course he felt a phantom massage

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:03.620
in his phantom hand, he claimed.

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:05.870
'Cause he needed to
relieve the phantom pain.

00:37:06.873 --> 00:37:08.633
This is not, unlike the mirror procedure,

00:37:08.633 --> 00:37:11.441
this has not been tested in
clinics, in a clinical setting

00:37:11.441 --> 00:37:12.950
using placebo controls.

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:14.790
But if it works, it'll be a clear example

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:17.700
of a practical application of
the idea of mirror neurons.

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:19.720
Leaving aside all the
arcane, theoretical debates

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:21.450
about how significant they are,

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:23.780
practically, in the clinic,
to alleviate phantom pain.

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:25.270
That guy doesn't care (mumbles) the theory

00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:27.225
or the mind or what it is.

00:37:27.225 --> 00:37:28.853
His pain goes away.

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:32.450
Now another prediction we made,

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:33.660
this is kind of cute, actually.

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:36.510
Going back to the motor neurons,

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:38.130
there's a condition called OCD,

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:39.550
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:41.360
In one particular variation
which is particularly

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:44.110
troubling to the patient
is ritual hand washing.

00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:47.090
A person accidentally touches a doorknob,

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:50.010
this mere minor contamination
elicits acute anxiety,

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:54.060
almost panic, and the guys
incessantly wash their hands,

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:58.740
to the point of erosion of
the hand, fingers and skin.

00:37:58.740 --> 00:37:59.870
And then we said, "Well what if he simply

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:02.290
"watches another guy washing his hand?"

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:03.380
Sounds stupid.

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:06.420
Some of my best experiments
begin as jokes, by the way.

00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:08.960
(audience laughing)

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:10.320
So I said, "What if he
watches somebody..."

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:12.430
There's an experiment done
with Jalal, Baland Jalal,

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:14.160
a student in my lab.

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:17.460
So sure enough, in about
two thirds of the patients

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:21.630
we've seen with OCD traits,
hand washing compulsions,

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:24.890
they watch another
person washing his hands,

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:25.763
they get relief.

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:27.970
And the interesting thing about this

00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:29.440
is it can't be response bias

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.987
because they're surprised by it.

00:38:30.987 --> 00:38:31.820
"How the hell...?

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:34.670
"Why should him washing his
hand produce relief in me?

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:36.300
"It doesn't make any sense."

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:37.390
They express surprise.

00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:38.550
So I think we're on to something,

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:41.180
a potential treatment for OCD.

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:44.770
Because you could have
an app that shows you,

00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:46.610
as soon as you get the
urge, you look at your self

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:48.500
washing your own hand, you
don't have to go to the toilet

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.620
and spend half an hour, right?

00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:52.334
So another example of
a clinical application

00:38:52.334 --> 00:38:54.640
for something like OCD.

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:57.323
It's a topic that I know very
little about, by the way.

00:38:58.380 --> 00:38:59.760
I'd like to switch gears now and talk

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:02.513
about phenomenon which
we call synesthesia.

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:07.080
Which was documented
first by Francis Galton,

00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:09.320
in 19th century, first
cousin of Charles Darwin.

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:11.030
He noticed some otherwise normal people

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:12.640
in the general population.

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:15.230
He said it was rare, one
in 1,000, one in 500,

00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:18.040
now we know one in 50
people have synesthesia.

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:20.130
So this condition is one where a person

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:21.680
is otherwise completely normal.

00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:25.270
If he sees a printed number
on a white sheet of paper,

00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:27.470
like five is red, six
is blue, seven is green,

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:28.870
eight is chartreuse, nine is indigo,

00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:29.920
and so on and so forth.

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.790
The color remains constant
for any particular individuals

00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:35.030
over years, stable over years.

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:36.180
It's different for different people,

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:37.690
not the same colors for different people.

00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:40.700
Although there are trends, we
can get to that if you want.

00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:45.700
Now since the discovery
of synesthesia by Galton,

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:48.410
there have been hundreds of case reports,

00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:50.319
but no attempt to understand
what's going on in the brain

00:39:50.319 --> 00:39:51.763
or what causes it.

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:54.250
And in fact, people brushed it aside,

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:56.423
classic example of an anomaly in science,

00:39:56.423 --> 00:39:59.130
a Kuhnian anomaly, which
people brush under the carpet

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:00.247
and say, "It doesn't make any sense.

00:40:00.247 --> 00:40:01.657
"What do you mean five
is red, six is blue?

00:40:01.657 --> 00:40:03.560
"It doesn't make any sense."

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:06.490
Well often anomalies can
pave the way to new discovery

00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:08.053
and new areas of research.

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:12.610
So we thought, well why
not study these people?

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:15.385
And the standard explanation
of synesthesia, by the way,

00:40:15.385 --> 00:40:18.640
one explanation is these are just crazy.

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:19.740
That's not an explanation.

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:22.320
Even if it's true, let's put
that aside for the time being,

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:24.560
come back to it as a last resort.

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:27.223
Second explanation is,
they're high on drugs.

00:40:28.059 --> 00:40:30.850
And sure enough, it's about
seven times more common

00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:32.491
in Berkeley than at UCSD.

00:40:32.491 --> 00:40:35.740
(audience laughing)

00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:37.320
But leaving that aside,
the fact that drugs

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:39.360
influence synesthesia is not evidence

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:41.490
against synesthesia being
a legitimate phenomenon.

00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:42.550
It makes it more interesting.

00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:44.880
Why would some drugs
enhance this propensity

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.713
to see numbers as color?

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:50.970
The third explanation is
they're just childhood memories.

00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:52.530
They've been playing with
the refrigerator magnets

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:54.720
and five was red and six
was green and seven was blue

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:56.803
and eight was yellow
and so on and so forth.

00:40:56.803 --> 00:40:58.150
This doesn't make any sense to me

00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:00.430
because why does it run in families?

00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:02.760
Galton himself showed that
synesthesia runs in families

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:05.783
and possibly in a Mendelian
fashion, so it's inherited.

00:41:06.714 --> 00:41:08.220
So you have to see the same madness

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:10.750
as being passed on from
generation to generation,

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:11.710
which didn't make much sense.

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:13.963
But you had to keep in
mind the possibility.

00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:17.340
And then if it's true,
if it's just magnets,

00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:18.370
why don't we all have synesthesia?

00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:20.090
Why only a subset?

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:21.720
Obvious questions.

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:25.573
The fourth possibility is more
ingenious but a bit vague.

00:41:25.573 --> 00:41:27.670
Along the lines that George
and I have been thinking.

00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:29.820
I'm not saying you're
vague, but I'm vague.

00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:33.460
That is that maybe
they're being metaphorical

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:34.930
when they say five is green.

00:41:34.930 --> 00:41:37.200
Maybe it's like oh, say, F sharp is blue.

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.590
It's like saying cheddar cheese is sharp.

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:40.480
The cheese isn't sharp.

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:42.350
You rub it on your skin it's soft.

00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:44.550
You say, "No, no, no, the taste is sharp."

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:45.383
But there's a circularity there.

00:41:45.383 --> 00:41:47.830
Why do you use a gustatory metaphor,

00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:50.910
a tactile metaphor to describe
a gustatory sensation?

00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:53.270
There's a whole area of
research that this leads to

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:55.070
which we don't have time to go into.

00:41:57.659 --> 00:41:59.130
But this may be on the right track,

00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:01.360
as you can see, this is
what I'm gonna argue.

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.860
First of all, are they crazy?

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:05.827
We did a number of experiments
to show that they are not.

00:42:05.827 --> 00:42:07.510
It's a legitimate phenomenon.

00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:09.770
And in a subset (mumbles)
there are two kinds

00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:12.420
of synaesthetes, the
projectors and the associators.

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:15.240
Projectors are the minority,
maybe about 10 to 15%,

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:18.120
synaesthetes, and we
stumbled on two of them,

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:21.350
luckily when we started doing
the research on synesthesia.

00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:23.000
Associators are more difficult to study.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.610
They constitute 80 to 90% of them.

00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:26.160
So let's talk about projectors.

00:42:27.864 --> 00:42:29.070
So we said, "How do you know
they're not making it up?"

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:30.570
Well we designed this display.

00:42:32.686 --> 00:42:36.410
You've got a synaesthete
who sees numbers as color.

00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:38.700
So we show normal people
this panel of fives

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:40.450
with some two scattered among them.

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:43.980
Can you find the twos?

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:45.110
One there, one there, one there.

00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:46.380
They form a shape, either a square

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:48.200
or a triangle or a circle.

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.060
And it takes ages.

00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:52.348
Takes 20, 30 seconds before you spot the

00:42:52.348 --> 00:42:55.608
upside down triangle.

00:42:55.608 --> 00:42:57.400
A synaesthete looking at
it sees it much faster.

00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:00.950
He says, "Oh I see an
upside down red triangle."

00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:03.440
If you're a projector synaesthete.

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:05.840
Now if he's crazy, how
come he's better than us?

00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:09.210
This has been confirmed
by Jamie Warr, by the way,

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:11.200
in London, in a larger group of...

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:13.860
This experiment done with Ed Halbert,

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:15.710
he used to be a student here at Berkeley

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:17.503
before he turned into a grad student.

00:43:18.492 --> 00:43:19.774
Also there's phenomenology.

00:43:19.774 --> 00:43:21.330
You talk to these patients,

00:43:21.330 --> 00:43:25.320
for them it's not a patient,
subject, sorry about that.

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:27.997
Synaesthete I saw recently
said, "Eight is blue."

00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:32.087
And I said, "Do you see the
blue in your mind's eye?

00:43:32.087 --> 00:43:33.127
"Like when you think of Cinderella

00:43:33.127 --> 00:43:35.527
"you think of a pumpkin
or you think of a chariot?

00:43:35.527 --> 00:43:38.360
"Or do you literally see it blue?"

00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:41.607
And she said, "No, no,
I actually see it blue.

00:43:41.607 --> 00:43:42.917
"It's not like Cinderella and the pumpkin.

00:43:42.917 --> 00:43:44.697
"Because there I can think
of Cinderella and her gown,

00:43:44.697 --> 00:43:46.107
"Cinderella and mice.

00:43:46.107 --> 00:43:48.467
"Whereas here I can only think of blue.

00:43:48.467 --> 00:43:50.337
"The irresistible urge to see blue.

00:43:50.337 --> 00:43:53.153
"And not only that, in my case,
it spills out of the color,

00:43:53.153 --> 00:43:55.167
"Spills out of the
letter and forms a halo,

00:43:55.167 --> 00:43:56.417
"a dusty halo around it."

00:43:57.881 --> 00:43:58.750
Now why would that be?

00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:02.882
The first thing I did was
simply put an amoeba around it,

00:44:02.882 --> 00:44:03.914
and the halo gets blocked,

00:44:03.914 --> 00:44:05.720
part of the halo gets
blocked by the amoeba.

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:07.420
These kinds of phenomena you can't explain

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:10.050
in terms of vague
psychological associations.

00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:12.410
Suggests strongly that
they're sensory in character.

00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:14.460
You can even put an illusory
contour around the A,

00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:16.460
it gets blocked by the illusory contour.

00:44:17.350 --> 00:44:19.460
We can get back to where
that's happening in a minute.

00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:22.500
So what's happening in
synesthesia, what's going on?

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:25.100
Rumor that it runs in
families, that's one clue.

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:27.310
It's also (mumbles) that
synesthesia is seven or eight times

00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:29.560
more common among artists,
poets, and novelists

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:31.430
and other creative people
than in the normal population.

00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:32.660
That's another piece of the puzzle.

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:34.530
We've got all these pieces of the puzzle.

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:35.790
Why is it eight times more common

00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:38.340
among novelists, poets, and artists?

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:39.740
Why?
We'll see in a minute.

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:44.340
And in the subset of synesthesia
we've got the projectors,

00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:48.590
we stumbled on, the
anatomy is straightforward.

00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:51.840
Greg Hubbard and I were
looking at brain atlases.

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:55.389
We saw that the area for
numbers shown in the red,

00:44:55.389 --> 00:44:59.700
discovered by Stanislas
Dehaine and Tim Ritger

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:04.700
in our lab, in our department,

00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:08.210
shows where graphemes are
represented, including numerals.

00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:11.293
And the green path is (mumbles) Z4.

00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:15.360
This is involved in processing color.

00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:16.727
We said, "What's the
likelihood of the most common

00:45:16.727 --> 00:45:18.473
"type of synesthesia,
number-color synesthesia

00:45:18.473 --> 00:45:20.367
"and these two are
right next to each other

00:45:20.367 --> 00:45:22.217
"in the fusiform gyrus of the brain?"

00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:26.887
Well we said, "It's very
unlikely to be a coincidence.

00:45:26.887 --> 00:45:29.277
"Maybe there is some
accidental cross-wiring

00:45:29.277 --> 00:45:30.485
"between number and color."

00:45:30.485 --> 00:45:31.910
So every time they see
a black and white number

00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:34.120
it activates a number
node and cross-activates

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:37.440
a color node spontaneously so
they see a particular color.

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:38.950
Now why would there be cross-activation

00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:40.750
of this kind in these people?

00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:41.660
Remember the clue comes

00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:43.300
from the fact that it runs in families.

00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:45.750
Remember that in the
fetus, in early embryology,

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:47.790
in early, early childhood, perhaps,

00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:49.470
everything is connected to everything.

00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:50.800
That's an overstatement,

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:53.817
but a tremendous
redundancy of connections.

00:45:53.817 --> 00:45:55.400
But then these excess
connections are pruned away

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:58.180
by pruning genes to create
a modular architecture

00:45:58.180 --> 00:45:59.310
that characterizes the adult brain,

00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:01.870
including number area and color area.

00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:04.120
So if these pruning genes are mutated,

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:06.730
there's defective pruning,
then some redundant connections

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:07.980
are gonna be left behind,

00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:14.100
for example the mutant pruning gene

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:16.940
is selectively expressed
by transcription factors

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:18.760
in the fusiform gyrus alone,

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:22.020
you get this quirky
number-color synesthesia.

00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:23.070
And what about the higher synaesthetes?

00:46:23.070 --> 00:46:25.880
Where it's not just the
number that produces,

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:27.370
visual appearance of the
number that produces...

00:46:27.370 --> 00:46:29.622
So-called associators, what about them?

00:46:29.622 --> 00:46:32.100
Well we did a simple
experiment on these people,

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:33.470
these projectors.

00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:35.740
We said, we asked a very simple question

00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:37.170
which had not been
asked about synaesthetes

00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:38.870
since the 100 years we've known about it,

00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:40.200
since Galton's time.

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:42.026
Instead of showing them a five,

00:46:42.026 --> 00:46:44.126
why don't you show them a V, a Roman five?

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:47.620
Instead of showing them an
Arabic six or an Arabic seven,

00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:49.450
I should call them Indian by the way,

00:46:49.450 --> 00:46:51.180
but instead of showing an Arabic number,

00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:53.256
why when you show them a
Roman five, what do they see?

00:46:53.256 --> 00:46:54.089
Do they see a color?

00:46:54.089 --> 00:46:55.150
The answer is, I've
never met a synaesthete

00:46:55.150 --> 00:46:57.300
who's seen color in a Roman number.

00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:59.150
So it's not the concept of the number

00:46:59.150 --> 00:47:01.310
creates the color, it's
the visual appearance,

00:47:01.310 --> 00:47:04.350
which fits the idea that fusiform gyrus

00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:07.730
encodes the visual appearance,
not the higher level concept

00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:09.883
of numerosity, ordinality, cardinality,

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:12.040
and all that good stuff.

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:14.720
Which, by the way, I think
happens in the angular gyrus.

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:17.084
We've long known that the angular gyrus,

00:47:17.084 --> 00:47:19.730
if the left angular gyrus is
damaged, you get discalculius.

00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:23.880
If you ask him to subtract 17 from 21,

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:25.127
he'll say, "Oh it's 14."

00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:27.543
He will glibly say it's 14,

00:47:27.543 --> 00:47:30.263
and is sure that he knows it for certain.

00:47:31.572 --> 00:47:34.393
Discalculia's another whole lecture.

00:47:37.101 --> 00:47:39.920
So I think in the projector synaesthetes,

00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:41.770
the cross-wiring gene is expressed,

00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:43.440
you have the cross-wiring gene,

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:45.370
we get number-color synesthesia.

00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:48.130
In the associator synaesthete,
it's expressed higher up

00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:51.410
so the idea of sequence is mapped

00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:53.633
onto higher color areas in the brain.

00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:56.200
In the color processing hierarchy.

00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:58.450
So it's expressed higher up.

00:47:58.450 --> 00:48:00.000
I can show you a diagram later.

00:48:01.384 --> 00:48:02.320
In the vicinity of the angular gyrus

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:04.890
you get higher synaesthetes
or lower synaesthetes.

00:48:04.890 --> 00:48:06.720
Which would explain why some
of these higher synaesthetes

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:11.720
also experience not only numbers as color

00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:14.170
but days of the week as color.

00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:17.850
Monday is red, Tuesday is
blue, Wednesday is chartreuse.

00:48:17.850 --> 00:48:19.700
And months of the year as color.

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:21.630
Again, it seems completely
and utterly incomprehensible.

00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:23.140
What do they all have in common?

00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:24.880
Months of the year, days
of the week, and numbers?

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:26.460
Sequence.

00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:28.590
So I think the angular gyrus
is where the action is.

00:48:28.590 --> 00:48:31.170
And now there's some
research using DT imaging

00:48:31.170 --> 00:48:34.980
by Rumka Holt in our lab,
she's visiting our lab,

00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:36.320
she has shown that in fact,

00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:38.470
if you do DT imaging,
there's more white matter

00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:40.730
in the vicinity of the angular
gyrus in the associators

00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:43.610
and in the fusiform
gyrus in the projectors.

00:48:43.610 --> 00:48:45.620
But this is still very preliminary,

00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:47.550
I should add a note of warning.

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:48.807
Okay here's another fun example,

00:48:48.807 --> 00:48:50.807
and we can play games with these people.

00:48:51.810 --> 00:48:53.260
How many of you can read that?

00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:54.093
Raise your hand.

00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:56.443
Very tough.

00:48:56.443 --> 00:48:57.423
Now squint your eyes.

00:48:58.683 --> 00:49:01.400
(audience laughing)

00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:03.000
George you can't read it yet?

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.000
Remove your glasses.

00:49:09.610 --> 00:49:11.190
Okay.

00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:13.230
Alright, now guess what happens

00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:15.523
when you show this to a
projector synaesthete?

00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:17.627
Projector synaesthete says,

00:49:17.627 --> 00:49:19.437
"Well I see a jumble of
colors but I don't know why,

00:49:19.437 --> 00:49:22.170
"because you know I
can't see any letters."

00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:25.877
Then they say, "Oh wait a
minute, I know why that's red.

00:49:25.877 --> 00:49:27.207
"It's an N.

00:49:27.207 --> 00:49:29.647
"It's an O, that's why it's blue.

00:49:29.647 --> 00:49:31.967
"S, E, oh I see, ha ha ha."

00:49:33.210 --> 00:49:35.620
Okay so they're seeing
the colors being activated

00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:37.020
but it's hidden numbers.

00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:39.927
Before they reach consciousness
and register as graphemes.

00:49:40.830 --> 00:49:43.550
So the blind side for
numerals in synaesthetes.

00:49:43.550 --> 00:49:46.363
So what I'm claiming is,
in these individuals,

00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:50.442
those hidden numbers are activating

00:49:50.442 --> 00:49:52.813
the color area of the brain,

00:49:52.813 --> 00:49:55.928
and then they're evoking
a proper (mumbles)

00:49:55.928 --> 00:49:58.246
they're evoking a number
area of the brain.

00:49:58.246 --> 00:49:59.400
Activating the number area.

00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:01.400
Evoking the appropriate color even before

00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:02.400
the message is sent higher up

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:05.040
to be recognized as a grapheme.

00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:06.690
So you're seeing the
colors and using the colors

00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:08.490
to infer what the grapheme...

00:50:08.490 --> 00:50:10.070
The most striking
example of this I've seen

00:50:10.070 --> 00:50:13.580
is two colorblind synaesthetes.

00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:15.510
Sounds like an oxymoron.

00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:17.396
This person could see a
limited range of color

00:50:17.396 --> 00:50:19.160
because of vision cone
pigments in the eye.

00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:21.160
Limited range of color
in the external world,

00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:23.476
but when they saw numbers,
they would see colors

00:50:23.476 --> 00:50:24.680
that you would never see
in the external world.

00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:27.630
They call them, charmingly
refer to them as martian colors.

00:50:28.758 --> 00:50:30.420
And the reason again...

00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:31.417
We've seen two patients like this.

00:50:31.417 --> 00:50:34.930
The reason again is because
the cone pigments are deficient

00:50:34.930 --> 00:50:37.810
so they can't see colors
in the real world,

00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:39.200
they see only limited range.

00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:42.560
But they saw a number, the
number activates a number node

00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:44.860
and cross-activates color neurons

00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:47.690
which can't experience those
colors in the real world

00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:49.520
because the receptors don't exist.

00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:52.060
It's hardwired for seeing
quote-unquote martian colors.

00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:53.320
Is that clear?

00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:54.870
This again eliminates any possibility

00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:56.583
of learning being the
basis of synesthesia.

00:50:56.583 --> 00:50:59.490
How can you learn a
color you've never seen?

00:50:59.490 --> 00:51:01.861
Another phenomenon Galton,
the astute Galton noticed

00:51:01.861 --> 00:51:04.060
was what he called number lines.

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:06.610
When I ask any of you to
imagine numbers in front of you,

00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:11.540
one to 10, you may be
crudely going left to right,

00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:13.418
one, two, three, four,
and it's very vague,

00:51:13.418 --> 00:51:15.020
there's nothing really clear.

00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:16.970
But in some individuals, Galton noticed,

00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:19.950
and again we find this about
one in 50, to one in hundred,

00:51:19.950 --> 00:51:23.720
will see a vivid,
three-dimensional layout of numbers

00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:24.590
in the visual field.

00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:27.240
One is here, two is here,
and it's convoluted,

00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:29.030
not straight line left to right.

00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:31.111
It's convoluted, 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,

00:51:31.111 --> 00:51:34.170
10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:36.310
And often doubles back
on itself like this.

00:51:36.310 --> 00:51:39.269
So fifteen may be close to two,

00:51:39.269 --> 00:51:43.880
instead of being close to
16 or 14 in Cartesian space.

00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:45.670
And this has been ignored for 100 years

00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:48.730
and Ed Hubbard and I and David
Brian did some experiments

00:51:48.730 --> 00:51:50.690
to establish that the
people are not faking it.

00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:51.930
We used the number-distance effect,

00:51:51.930 --> 00:51:53.330
I don't have time to go into it.

00:51:53.330 --> 00:51:55.150
So they're not faking it.

00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:58.560
The number line affects their
reaction time to numbers.

00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:01.560
So then there'd be mixed
results on this phenomenon.

00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:04.326
But everybody agrees with
me about the phenomenon,

00:52:04.326 --> 00:52:05.310
the question is why does it arise?

00:52:05.310 --> 00:52:07.540
Why would some people see numbers

00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:10.490
and imagine numbers like...

00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:15.400
Again, it's a classic example
of an anomaly in science.

00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:17.540
And people ignore it for that reason.

00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:19.400
I don't know the answer to
why they see it this way,

00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:21.140
unlike the grapheme color synesthesia

00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:23.120
where I had a clear answer.

00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:25.310
But only one reason, the
one thing I can think of is

00:52:25.310 --> 00:52:27.230
arithmetic and numbers and mathematics

00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:29.640
is a recent event in human evolution,

00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:31.760
maybe 5,000, 10,000 years old.

00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:33.780
And the brain can't invent
a completely new algorithm

00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:36.640
from scratch to handle
numbers, ordinality,

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:38.205
sequences and all of that.

00:52:38.205 --> 00:52:40.428
So what it does is, it adopts a trick

00:52:40.428 --> 00:52:43.413
using preexisting maps in the brain.

00:52:43.413 --> 00:52:46.480
Maps go back into Ionian times
in our fish-like ancestors.

00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:47.660
Brain is full of maps.

00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:50.070
So you map on the ideal
concept of numerical sequence,

00:52:50.070 --> 00:52:52.440
ordinality and cardinality and quantity.

00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:55.260
Onto spacial map to create a graph.

00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:58.900
If something goes awry with
this remapping of this concept

00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:01.440
of sequence onto a spacial map,

00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:03.470
you get these peculiar number lines.

00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:05.820
Now how do you test this idea?
I have no idea.

00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:10.140
But it's an interesting idea nonetheless.

00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:14.090
Now some of these people
also have, I'm almost done...

00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:15.160
Some of these individuals,

00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:16.700
and we've studied a number of these,

00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:19.180
David Brian has studied them in our lab.

00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:21.412
Have what we call calendar lines.

00:53:21.412 --> 00:53:23.943
Here is a woman we studied recently.

00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:27.470
And when I ask any one of you to imagine

00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:29.190
a calendar in front of you,

00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:31.840
typically most people imagine
a rectangular calendar.

00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:35.810
Like a real calendar,
January, February, March,

00:53:35.810 --> 00:53:38.460
and then you know, so on and so forth.

00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:40.595
Very vague, nothing very clear.

00:53:40.595 --> 00:53:41.630
It's in your mind's eye.

00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:44.210
These people see a very clearly laid-out,

00:53:44.210 --> 00:53:46.100
three-dimensionally laid-out calendar,

00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:48.440
always circular, never rectangular,

00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:51.160
and never in the cardinal plane
but in the transverse plane,

00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:53.620
like a hula hoop going
through their chest.

00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:55.170
January, February, March, April, May...

00:53:55.170 --> 00:54:00.170
Current month always occupies
the ego of the calendar.

00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:04.290
You see this repeatedly
in different subjects.

00:54:04.290 --> 00:54:06.940
And here's an interesting
one that George would like.

00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:09.740
You'll do interesting experiments on them

00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:12.363
like what if you tilt
their head like this?

00:54:12.363 --> 00:54:13.513
Does the calendar tilt?

00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:17.750
The answer is no, it stays like
a water level, where it is.

00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:19.210
Here is the best part.

00:54:19.210 --> 00:54:22.730
If you ask them to rotate
their head like this,

00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:24.375
what happens to the calendar?

00:54:24.375 --> 00:54:25.280
The calendar's here like a hula hoop.

00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:27.410
Rotate their head like that to the right,

00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:28.277
what happens to the calendar?

00:54:28.277 --> 00:54:30.260
Calendar, in this particular case,

00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:31.880
remains attached to the head.

00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:33.410
Sorry, attached to the body.

00:54:33.410 --> 00:54:34.330
It's in sort of...

00:54:34.330 --> 00:54:37.140
Put it crudely, body-centered,
not head-centered.

00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:38.960
But the exciting thing is,

00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:41.540
she noticed that the left side
of the calendar became fuzzy

00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:45.033
as she rotated her head, like
a real, physical calendar.

00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:47.680
Why in the hell would a mental calendar

00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:49.170
be like a physical calendar?

00:54:49.170 --> 00:54:51.150
And she said also, she organizes her life,

00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:53.350
her time and space and calendar,

00:54:53.350 --> 00:54:54.750
using this calendar helps her organize

00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:56.900
her otherwise chaotic
and meaningless life.

00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:00.120
And then she looks back

00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:02.570
and she looks on the other
side the opposite happens.

00:55:02.570 --> 00:55:04.963
So she can use this mental calendar

00:55:04.963 --> 00:55:08.730
to organize her daily
activities and her future,

00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:09.840
project herself into the future.

00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:12.050
Surely a vital part of
what you call the self.

00:55:12.050 --> 00:55:16.120
And not only that, here's
what we're testing currently.

00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:19.240
If she does this, memories,
episodic memories,

00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:21.828
events that happened in
January, February, become fuzzy.

00:55:21.828 --> 00:55:24.610
She has to look there
to retrieve memories.

00:55:24.610 --> 00:55:25.980
She's an undergraduate student,

00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:28.360
I don't think she's read Lekov's book,

00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:29.577
so I don't think she's making it up,

00:55:29.577 --> 00:55:31.040
but we don't know yet for sure.

00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:31.940
We're testing her.

00:55:32.898 --> 00:55:35.610
Lovely example of embodied
cognition, her neck muscles

00:55:35.610 --> 00:55:38.110
are gaining access to
memories, episodic memories.

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:42.180
Now, where is it happening?

00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:43.530
This is what we always do, when we look

00:55:43.530 --> 00:55:45.680
at peculiar phenomenon, to nail it down,

00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:47.560
show what's going on, so
it's a real phenomenon,

00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:49.500
the patient's not making it
up, and try to figure out

00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:50.333
what's going on in the brain

00:55:50.333 --> 00:55:53.580
and a possible cure if it requires curing.

00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:54.700
What's going on in the brain?

00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:56.060
Well, I said the angular gyrus

00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:58.030
must play a critical role in sequence.

00:55:58.030 --> 00:56:00.540
I think it plays a
critical role in calendars.

00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:02.230
This can be tested.

00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:04.550
But then, what about hippocampus?

00:56:04.550 --> 00:56:08.180
It's got play cells, it's
got two kinds of cells

00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:10.780
involved in spatial and
temporal labeling of events.

00:56:11.896 --> 00:56:15.100
And now it turns out, looking at atlases,

00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:16.080
there are direct connections

00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:17.440
between the angular gyrus
and the hippocampus,

00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:19.290
the inferior longitudinal fasciculus.

00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:22.870
And that's shown in the next slide.

00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:26.580
So I'm claiming that the
human mental calendar,

00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:27.980
which we take for granted but we use

00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:29.460
for organizing our lives,

00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:30.800
life would be completely meaningless...

00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:33.079
People usually attribute
it to fondle structures.

00:56:33.079 --> 00:56:34.700
I think fondle structures
only involve paying attention

00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:36.220
to specific regions of the calendar.

00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:37.735
Calendar itself is
constructed by interactions

00:56:37.735 --> 00:56:41.033
between the left angular
gyrus and the hippocampus.

00:56:44.813 --> 00:56:45.646
Okay I'll just conclude there

00:56:45.646 --> 00:56:47.480
by saying that all of these problems

00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:50.190
which are tangentially related
to the problem of self,

00:56:50.190 --> 00:56:51.690
how you construct the body image,

00:56:51.690 --> 00:56:54.070
how you feel a hand cut inside your body,

00:56:54.070 --> 00:56:56.264
embodied cognition, projecting
yourself into the future

00:56:56.264 --> 00:56:59.680
and creating a calendar around
which your life revolves,

00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:01.210
your problems are considered intractable

00:57:01.210 --> 00:57:03.310
but we can sort of begin to
just scratch the surface.

00:57:03.310 --> 00:57:04.143
Thank you.

00:57:05.737 --> 00:57:08.904
(audience applauding)

00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:13.580
- Hi, my name is Eric.

00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:15.450
So I have a question about synesthesia.

00:57:15.450 --> 00:57:16.283
- Sure.

00:57:16.283 --> 00:57:18.330
- You mentioned that
synesthesia runs in families.

00:57:18.330 --> 00:57:20.312
So there's a genetic factor.

00:57:20.312 --> 00:57:25.060
In your studies, did you notice
that the same synesthesia,

00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:28.490
the color-number
synesthesia is hereditary,

00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:30.610
or is it different?

00:57:30.610 --> 00:57:32.890
- It's a problem statistically
because the most common form

00:57:32.890 --> 00:57:36.370
is number-color or letter, grapheme-color.

00:57:36.370 --> 00:57:37.970
I think there is a
tendency for the same form

00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:39.827
to be inherited, but it's not been...

00:57:39.827 --> 00:57:41.050
The only thing we know for sure

00:57:41.050 --> 00:57:42.427
is if you have one type of synesthesia,

00:57:42.427 --> 00:57:43.950
you're much more likely to have another

00:57:43.950 --> 00:57:45.610
unrelated type of synesthesia as well.

00:57:45.610 --> 00:57:48.370
Which supports my
defective pruning theory.

00:57:48.370 --> 00:57:50.752
The same transcription
factors are expressed

00:57:50.752 --> 00:57:53.541
in two different regions
in the same brain.

00:57:53.541 --> 00:57:54.690
And you're gonna get two unrelated types

00:57:54.690 --> 00:57:57.170
of synesthesia co-occurring,
more often than by chance.

00:57:57.170 --> 00:57:59.820
- Are these like functional
areas that are sort of...

00:58:02.006 --> 00:58:03.570
The function's kind of fused together?

00:58:03.570 --> 00:58:06.930
- To give you an example,
the number-color synaesthetes

00:58:06.930 --> 00:58:09.780
are often the ones with
the calendar synesthesia.

00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:12.343
And often the ones with
tone-color as well.

00:58:12.343 --> 00:58:14.840
They don't always have to occur together

00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:17.350
but often do, or much
more often than by chance.

00:58:17.350 --> 00:58:18.400
- Thank you.
- Sure.

00:58:19.330 --> 00:58:20.690
I didn't mention about creativity,

00:58:20.690 --> 00:58:22.740
but I'll get to that later.

00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:24.707
- Hi, thanks for a great talk.

00:58:24.707 --> 00:58:27.540
I wanted to say something
here a little more

00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:30.610
about the metaphorical views
or the anthropomorphism

00:58:30.610 --> 00:58:33.780
involved with talking about
the neurons in the brain.

00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:37.500
When you say that an area
that normally corresponds

00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:39.513
to an amputated limb or something,

00:58:39.513 --> 00:58:44.513
when you say it's starved for
stimulation or it's hungry

00:58:45.514 --> 00:58:48.880
or something like that, so
what is that describing?

00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:53.148
Why would a non-stimulated
area in the brain care

00:58:53.148 --> 00:58:55.410
whether or not it was stimulated or not?

00:58:55.410 --> 00:58:58.850
So in what sense is there a
causal explanation for saying...

00:58:58.850 --> 00:59:03.200
Or the cross-wiring sounds
a little more plausible

00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:05.370
than saying oh it's hungry or it's starved

00:59:05.370 --> 00:59:08.283
or stimulation wants to move around?

00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:11.460
- I was just being loose
with the terminology.

00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:13.553
Sorry.

00:59:14.647 --> 00:59:16.220
It's a legitimate question.

00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:18.450
- I forget the name of that syndrome

00:59:18.450 --> 00:59:21.330
where somebody wants
to have an amputation.

00:59:21.330 --> 00:59:22.220
- Xenomelia.

00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:23.260
- Xenomelia?

00:59:23.260 --> 00:59:24.093
- Yeah.

00:59:24.093 --> 00:59:25.350
- Great.

00:59:25.350 --> 00:59:29.143
Just a question of ethics in that regard.

00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:31.440
- Before it's not done yet.

00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:34.330
- Well but do we mutilate somebody

00:59:34.330 --> 00:59:37.980
because their heart wants
to look differently?

00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:40.000
That's the kind of issue that has come up

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.380
and have you seen some advances

00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:44.300
in figuring that ethical question out?

00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:45.670
- I'm interested in those issues,

00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:47.160
but it doesn't come up in our case

00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:50.970
because the patient, no surgeon
will ever do the amputation.

00:59:50.970 --> 00:59:53.529
They have to go across
the border to get it done.

00:59:53.529 --> 00:59:55.060
- At least in the US.
- At least in the US.

00:59:55.060 --> 00:59:55.893
- Thank you.

00:59:58.450 --> 00:59:59.400
- Hi.

00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:00.593
Do you have any thoughts of

01:00:00.593 --> 01:00:04.277
what is going on in
schizophrenia, for example?

01:00:04.277 --> 01:00:08.260
The self is broken or I don't know how...

01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:10.310
Maybe do you have some thoughts about it?

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:12.333
- I've thought about it,

01:00:12.333 --> 01:00:14.370
but not enough to say
anything intelligent.

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:17.573
Thank you.

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:23.763
- These unexplained thought
forms like synesthesia,

01:00:24.610 --> 01:00:29.423
any evidence or maybe a feeling
of immortality of the soul?

01:00:32.896 --> 01:00:36.230
(audience laughing)

01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:37.680
- It's a question for George.

01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:41.090
- Quick question.

01:00:41.090 --> 01:00:44.050
You didn't wanna touch on, in this talk,

01:00:44.050 --> 01:00:46.930
but just a brief background from you

01:00:46.930 --> 01:00:51.483
on the ancient civilizations of India,

01:00:52.570 --> 01:00:56.470
the whole Vedic tantra Agama literature.

01:00:58.910 --> 01:01:02.360
How do you connect it yourself with some

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:04.990
of the phenomena that
you've talked about today?

01:01:04.990 --> 01:01:07.280
- There's the metaphysical
issues that are being dealt with

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:08.967
in Vedic literature or (mumbles).

01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:13.450
In Hebrew literature, in
neo-Christian literature

01:01:13.450 --> 01:01:14.283
which I haven't touched on

01:01:14.283 --> 01:01:15.960
because I don't have
any expertise in that.

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:18.340
I'm very interested in it, obviously.

01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:20.580
The self is something that
I can come to grips with,

01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:23.570
at least partially, so I
focus my attention on that.

01:01:23.570 --> 01:01:28.230
But I like sharing this
quotation from the Upanishads,

01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:30.210
where he says that the individual self,

01:01:30.210 --> 01:01:32.130
human beings are like windows.

01:01:32.130 --> 01:01:33.890
Let the light pass through.

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:36.110
And there's a central light
illuminating the building

01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:38.949
from inside, which is
called (foreign language),

01:01:38.949 --> 01:01:40.530
or universal spirit or
consciousness or whatever.

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:43.600
When an individual dies, the window shuts,

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:45.270
but the universal spirit continues shining

01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:46.750
through other windows.

01:01:46.750 --> 01:01:47.583
It's a comforting thought

01:01:47.583 --> 01:01:52.270
but I don't have any
deep thoughts about it.

01:01:52.270 --> 01:01:53.340
- Thank you.

01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:54.710
- It's a good question, though.

01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:57.810
- I wondered if you'd done
any research on photophobia?

01:01:57.810 --> 01:02:01.057
People's feeling pain
with regards to color.

01:02:01.057 --> 01:02:02.553
- I know a couple students who have that.

01:02:02.553 --> 01:02:04.480
We haven't studied it.

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:06.120
Fascinating question.

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:07.950
But I can't tell you anything about it.

01:02:07.950 --> 01:02:09.100
- Like whether pain's...?

01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:11.163
Okay.
Thanks.

01:02:12.133 --> 01:02:13.180
- Hi.

01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:16.230
You just briefly mentioned
that you hadn't explored

01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:18.980
creativity in synesthesia,
and I'm just wondering

01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:20.450
about work done on...

01:02:20.450 --> 01:02:25.440
I know with music, different
composers who are very skilled

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:27.900
who have synesthesia, different composers

01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:31.030
see different colors, like
Scriabin and Messiaen.

01:02:31.030 --> 01:02:32.149
These composers...

01:02:32.149 --> 01:02:35.920
Has there been any research
on where that happens

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:38.170
or what's the effect that's
going on in the brain

01:02:38.170 --> 01:02:41.180
and why they each see
different colors with sound

01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:42.013
and all of that?

01:02:42.013 --> 01:02:42.900
- Well we can't get that specific,

01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:45.000
but I do have a theory
about why synesthesia

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.710
is so much more common among
artists, poets, and novelists,

01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:50.950
why it promotes artistic talent.

01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:53.040
The reason is, I think that the same gene

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:55.320
that's expressed selectively
in fusiform gyrus

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:57.880
or angular gyrus producing
this quirky association

01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:01.080
of synesthesia, if it's
expressed throughout the brain,

01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:02.520
there's gonna be creative
cross-connectivity

01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:05.070
throughout the brain, and
ideas and concepts are also

01:03:05.070 --> 01:03:06.907
in far-flung regions of the
brain, like when you say

01:03:06.907 --> 01:03:09.660
Juliet is the east and Juliet is the sun.

01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:10.920
So Juliet is the sun, does that mean

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:12.080
she's a glowing ball of fire?

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:13.150
You don't say that.

01:03:13.150 --> 01:03:14.959
You say she's warm, she's nurturing,

01:03:14.959 --> 01:03:18.110
she's radiant like the
sun, she rises in bed

01:03:18.110 --> 01:03:19.650
like the sun rises in the east.

01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:21.030
She's the center of my solar system

01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:22.630
like the sun is the center
of the solar system.

01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:25.590
You can make as many
associations as you want.

01:03:25.590 --> 01:03:27.370
And these people have excess connections

01:03:27.370 --> 01:03:29.230
connecting far-flung brain regions,

01:03:29.230 --> 01:03:32.840
have a greater propensity to
link seemingly unrelated ideas.

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:35.560
And this is what we
call artistic creativity

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:37.860
or facility in metaphor.

01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:39.470
In fact, you can even think to put it

01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:44.190
in phrenological terms, each
node has a penumbra of meaning,

01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:47.042
like Juliet of the sun
has a penumbra of meanings

01:03:47.042 --> 01:03:48.023
associated with it.

01:03:48.885 --> 01:03:50.190
And because of the excess connections,

01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:52.170
the penumbra is bigger in synaesthetes.

01:03:52.170 --> 01:03:53.510
There's greater zones of overlap

01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:55.830
between two seemingly unrelated ideas,

01:03:55.830 --> 01:03:57.460
so it makes them more creative.

01:03:57.460 --> 01:03:59.300
Hence the higher incidents of...

01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:00.930
And hence, by the way,
the higher prevalence

01:04:00.930 --> 01:04:03.000
of synesthesia gene.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.120
Why would one in 50 people
have this quirky ability

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:07.003
of linking five and red?

01:04:07.003 --> 01:04:08.370
Because there's a hidden agenda

01:04:08.370 --> 01:04:10.960
because the gene makes the
outliers in the population

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:13.270
more creative and imaginative in general.

01:04:13.270 --> 01:04:14.450
And the penalty you pay for that

01:04:14.450 --> 01:04:16.270
is the minority who sees five as red

01:04:16.270 --> 01:04:18.880
but doesn't do them any harm.

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:20.200
Otherwise there would
be no selection process

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:21.710
to maintain this gene in the population,

01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:23.943
it would've drifted away a long time ago.

01:04:24.781 --> 01:04:26.012
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:04:26.012 --> 01:04:30.230
But regarding specific details
of colors and all that,

01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:31.063
we haven't studied that.

01:04:31.063 --> 01:04:31.896
It's a good question.

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:35.560
- On the same subject of creativity,

01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:39.240
I'm coming from linguistics
like literature,

01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:44.240
and I'm trying to bring new findings

01:04:45.270 --> 01:04:47.530
of neurolinguistics into how the brain

01:04:47.530 --> 01:04:49.903
acts and reacts in writing.

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:53.880
And I know a little bit about words

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:57.280
that has to do with visual and kinesthetic

01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:00.390
and auditorial, but I
wonder if there's something

01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:05.020
that is written on the subject of the self

01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:09.407
seeing itself in words
or not seeing, you know?

01:05:09.407 --> 01:05:11.140
Did you write anything about it?

01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:12.330
'Cause you said you--

01:05:12.330 --> 01:05:13.163
- There are literatures dealing with that

01:05:13.163 --> 01:05:14.840
but I'm not the right person to ask,

01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:16.480
but it's a good question.

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:18.190
There is literature pertaining to that

01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:21.907
which I can't think of it off hand, but...

01:05:21.907 --> 01:05:25.679
- Okay because the last
doctor that you said

01:05:25.679 --> 01:05:28.470
that you're not gonna
discuss is self-awareness.

01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:33.050
And I wonder if there's
some passages there

01:05:33.050 --> 01:05:35.913
in terms of self-awareness in creativity.

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:37.910
No?

01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:38.960
- Not that I know of.

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:43.290
- I had a question
regarding the phantom limb.

01:05:43.290 --> 01:05:45.710
Did you try using different
mirrors like concave and convex

01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:48.210
mirrors and seeing what kind of effect

01:05:48.210 --> 01:05:49.730
it would have in removing the pain?

01:05:49.730 --> 01:05:51.640
Or was it just?

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:52.970
So the types of mirror that you used

01:05:52.970 --> 01:05:54.720
in the phantom experiment...

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:55.553
Yes.

01:05:55.553 --> 01:05:56.386
- The only thing we've seen is if you use

01:05:56.386 --> 01:05:59.470
a magnifying mirror, the
phantom looks bigger,

01:05:59.470 --> 01:06:03.440
the pain also is amplified,
momentarily, fortunately.

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:05.920
- So there is a direct
correlation in terms of...

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:07.030
- Yeah.

01:06:07.030 --> 01:06:09.883
Hasn't been studied carefully
but appears to be, yeah.

01:06:11.710 --> 01:06:12.543
Good question.

01:06:12.543 --> 01:06:13.376
- Thank you.

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:16.430
- So I had a question about the case

01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:18.840
of martian colors and the
correlation of synesthesia.

01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:20.490
So is there a difference between people

01:06:20.490 --> 01:06:22.170
who develop colorblindness later in life

01:06:22.170 --> 01:06:23.850
due to macular degeneration

01:06:23.850 --> 01:06:26.500
or those who are colorblind
from birth so congenital?

01:06:27.487 --> 01:06:29.680
- We only studied the
ones who are from birth.

01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:30.720
- Okay, alright thanks.

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.633
- Two of them, but it's a good question.

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:36.213
- I have a question about synesthesia.

01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:39.740
You seem to argue in your
talk that synesthesia

01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:41.620
is more inborn, not learned...

01:06:43.610 --> 01:06:44.443
Or no?

01:06:44.443 --> 01:06:46.950
- It doesn't make any sense
if synesthesia is inborn.

01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:49.870
You're not born with letters
of the alphabet and numbers.

01:06:49.870 --> 01:06:51.290
- Right that's what I'm wondering about.

01:06:51.290 --> 01:06:53.870
- What I meant to say was the propensity

01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:57.210
to link arbitrary shapes
like numbers and colors

01:06:57.210 --> 01:06:59.410
is inborn in some people.

01:06:59.410 --> 01:07:02.640
Not that the phenomenon
of synesthesia is inborn.

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:04.960
- But why would it be
always letters and numbers?

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:08.330
And why is always letters or numbers...?

01:07:08.330 --> 01:07:10.810
- There's a tendency for
that region of the fusiform

01:07:10.810 --> 01:07:12.250
to represent arbitrary shapes,

01:07:12.250 --> 01:07:14.660
and there are rare cases
of synesthesia with faces

01:07:14.660 --> 01:07:17.720
showing colors, and faces are
also in the fusiform gyrus,

01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:21.360
as Charlie here has shown many
years ago, very elegantly.

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:22.410
- Alright, thank you.

01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:26.220
- Hi, thanks for being here.

01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:27.090
- Sure.

01:07:27.090 --> 01:07:28.530
- Two short questions.

01:07:28.530 --> 01:07:33.530
One is, you mentioned
something about neck muscles

01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:36.970
and memory at the very end
of your talk and I missed--

01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:38.610
- What I meant to say
was that in the person

01:07:38.610 --> 01:07:41.490
with episodic memory who
claims, we're not testing this

01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:44.690
rigorously by measuring her
repeatedly after a few weeks

01:07:44.690 --> 01:07:46.600
and a few months, giving
her some striking episodes

01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:48.340
and not telling her about it,

01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:50.293
but if you go by what she's saying,

01:07:51.130 --> 01:07:55.630
if she looks to the right,
a portion of the calendar

01:07:55.630 --> 01:07:57.250
is on the left becomes fuzzy,

01:07:57.250 --> 01:07:59.257
as it would if it were a real calendar.

01:07:59.257 --> 01:08:02.840
She said the memories of
those events become fuzzy too

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:06.450
and hard to drudge up in consciousness,

01:08:06.450 --> 01:08:09.490
until she turns around and
looks directly at the calendar.

01:08:09.490 --> 01:08:10.323
So it's helping her to...

01:08:10.323 --> 01:08:11.490
That's what I meant with the neck muscles

01:08:11.490 --> 01:08:16.490
gaining the access to episodic memories.

01:08:16.490 --> 01:08:18.560
That's the extreme
version of the hypothesis.

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:19.393
- Okay.

01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:22.690
Also, what do you think is happening

01:08:22.690 --> 01:08:27.040
when someone sees someone
getting massaged across the room,

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:30.330
and let's not use the anomalous case,

01:08:30.330 --> 01:08:31.930
let's just say anybody,

01:08:31.930 --> 01:08:34.468
they see somebody getting massaged...

01:08:34.468 --> 01:08:37.930
Can they start feeling a
little bit better or...

01:08:37.930 --> 01:08:40.080
I know you haven't studied that but...

01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:41.638
Like what do you think is happening?

01:08:41.638 --> 01:08:43.050
- Seems to me that
because of your afferents,

01:08:43.050 --> 01:08:44.400
you know that you're not being massaged,

01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:45.540
and that kind of silences it.

01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:48.930
So I doubt very much you'd
experience any benefit from that.

01:08:48.930 --> 01:08:53.930
But there are a group of
people who congenitally

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:56.800
have some (mumble) of hyper-empathy.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:58.830
It's claimed by Sarah Blakemore.

01:08:58.830 --> 01:09:02.880
I haven't seen subject myself,
but I trust her judgment.

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:04.410
So what you're saying may be true

01:09:04.410 --> 01:09:07.890
of a minority of the population,
20% of the population.

01:09:07.890 --> 01:09:09.030
But in the case of phantom limbs,

01:09:09.030 --> 01:09:11.090
the majority of the phantom
limb patients experience

01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:14.193
this hyper-empathy syndrome
because of the deafferentation.

01:09:15.550 --> 01:09:16.839
- Okay thank you.

01:09:16.839 --> 01:09:17.731
- Thank you.

01:09:17.731 --> 01:09:19.590
- I have a question about the soul.

01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:20.423
- Okay.

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:24.640
- Largely because of you, I got invited

01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:26.590
to the Gifford Lectures after you came.

01:09:27.798 --> 01:09:30.954
And these are the Gifford
Lectures on natural theology.

01:09:30.954 --> 01:09:34.930
And I couldn't resist
putting in stuff on the soul

01:09:34.930 --> 01:09:38.873
so I said, look if the
soul has to not, to exist

01:09:38.873 --> 01:09:43.090
after you die, and goes
to heaven, et cetera,

01:09:43.090 --> 01:09:47.800
or the other place, then
it has to, the question is,

01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:51.730
it has to not have anything
that is required by a body.

01:09:51.730 --> 01:09:54.170
So the question is, what
is required by a body?

01:09:54.170 --> 01:09:56.870
And if it's required by a
body, the soul can't have it.

01:09:56.870 --> 01:10:01.200
So you can study the properties
of the soul that way.

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:02.650
So can the soul see?

01:10:02.650 --> 01:10:03.960
No.

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:07.347
Hence, can't see, doesn't have
a visual cortex, et cetera.

01:10:07.347 --> 01:10:08.720
Can the soul hear?

01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:13.020
Sorry, doesn't have the
hearing apparatus for that.

01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:15.910
Can the soul feel touch?

01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:16.980
No.

01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:20.970
Doesn't have the appropriate
part of the cortex, et cetera.

01:10:20.970 --> 01:10:22.610
And you go through this list.

01:10:22.610 --> 01:10:24.720
Can the soul remember?

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:28.163
Doesn't have what is
required for memory for that.

01:10:29.330 --> 01:10:32.443
And so you go through that,
and the next question is,

01:10:32.443 --> 01:10:37.443
does the soul have a
personality or your personality?

01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:40.250
So the question is does personality depend

01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:43.090
upon the brain in any way?

01:10:43.090 --> 01:10:45.831
And this is a question I asked Nina,

01:10:45.831 --> 01:10:49.163
who knows much better than
I do, and she pointed out

01:10:49.163 --> 01:10:53.313
that the Phineas Gage phenomenon would say

01:10:53.313 --> 01:10:56.570
that it's lost control, it
doesn't have inhibition,

01:10:56.570 --> 01:10:59.700
et cetera, sort of like Donald
Trump or you know, (laughs).

01:11:03.790 --> 01:11:07.000
That's certainly one kind
of personality change,

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.790
but also there could be
larger brain injuries

01:11:09.790 --> 01:11:13.580
that could produce sort of
positive changes of all sort

01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:14.830
and if that's the case

01:11:14.830 --> 01:11:18.640
then the soul would not
have a fixed personality

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:21.400
and therefore not your personality,

01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:24.243
so in what case is it your soul?

01:11:25.836 --> 01:11:28.140
So the question about personality

01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:29.800
is something I really
wanted to ask you about,

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:31.600
if you've thought about that at all?

01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:34.200
- Short answer is no, I haven't.

01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:39.710
We should chat at length and
develop the idea further.

01:11:39.710 --> 01:11:40.543
- Okay good.

01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:43.210
- What's it like for a man like you

01:11:43.210 --> 01:11:46.323
to be living in what I
call deep south California?

01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:49.370
It's a strange culture down there

01:11:49.370 --> 01:11:52.020
that we have no understanding of up here.

01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:55.130
No I mean you've lived down
there for how many years?

01:11:55.130 --> 01:11:57.970
- 25, 30 years.
25 years, yeah.

01:11:57.970 --> 01:11:59.440
It's very surreal.

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:00.273
- Ah.

01:12:01.915 --> 01:12:03.746
You have a favorite example?

01:12:03.746 --> 01:12:05.910
(audience laughing)

01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:07.915
- I still have to think about it.

01:12:07.915 --> 01:12:11.804
(audience applauding)

01:12:11.804 --> 01:12:14.554
(cheerful music)
