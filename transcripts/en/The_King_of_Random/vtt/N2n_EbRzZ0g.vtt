00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:04.080
For this project I’m going to show you how
to make a Hot Wire Styro-Slicer that cuts

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.880
styrofoam shapes with precision and control.
It’ll produce professional looking 3Ds props

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.070
for cosplay or metal casting, as well as make
foam fighter jets, that actually fly across

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.000
the room. The Styro-Slicer has adjustable
power settings, cuts at any angle you need,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.960
and the best part is, the whole system fits
together ergonomically, for easy and clutter-free storage.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.700
Let’s start this project with a simple experiment,
using a 6 volt lantern battery and a thin piece of hanger wire.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.070
If we wrap the ends of the wire around the
battery terminals, you can see it gets incredibly hot, in just an instant.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.370
If fact it’s so hot, that if we try touching
it to a small piece of styrofoam, it slices

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.560
right through, like a hot knife, on butter.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.120
That’s the basic concept of how our hot
wire foam cutter is going to work, so let’s

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.320
get started building the foam factory with
some 3/4” PVC tubing and a few connectors.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.620
These pieces will create the frame for our
multi-functional wire saw, and you should

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.440
be able to find all of them easily, at any
home improvement store, in the sprinkler isle.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.630
Cut two pieces of tubing 11” long, and one
other piece 12”.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.710
And the only fittings you’re going to need
are two 90º elbows, and two slip caps.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.979
Now if you’re planning to customize the
colors on your Styro-Slicer, go ahead and

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.990
paint the elbows and the slip caps now, because
it will save you a step later on.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.390
The next things we’ll be needing, are some
#8 flat washers, and two #8 eye bolts, around 1-5/8” long.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.820
Place one of the washers on the bolt, then
screw them both firmly into the center of the cap.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.960
I pre-drilled my hole, using a 5/32” drill
bit, and it really couldn’t have worked better.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.479
Now continue screwing the eye-bolt into the
cap, until it’s tight against the outside

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.880
washer, then do the exact same thing with
the other one.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.920
The next step is to make a hole in the center
of the12” pipe, so mark the tubing 6”

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.900
from the end, and begin drilling.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.960
We only want a hole in one side though, so
when the drill bit punches through the top, it’s time to stop.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.080
I drilled my hole 3/8” wide, but you can
really make yours any size you want, as long

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.340
as you can get an electric cord to fit through
it.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.799
And speaking of cords, we’re going to need
one of those, next.

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.979
All we’re really after here is the cord
itself, so go ahead and chop off whatever’s

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.560
on the ends, then separate the two wires by
carefully pulling them apart.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.830
I split my cord into strands about 2 feet
long, which is actually a bit more than we

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.849
need, but it gives us a little wiggle room
for when we attach it in just a second.

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.469
Next we’ll need to expose the bare copper
wire inside, so use wire strippers to remove

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:15.959
about an inch of the plastic coating from
the ends.

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.549
Then twist the strands tightly together, and
bend it over, so you can twist it together

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.290
at the bottom, and form a little metal loop.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.629
Carefully push the split wires through the
hole in the tubing, and continue working them

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:29.430
in, until the wires snake around the corners,
and pop out the other ends.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.760
Now if you can figure out how to tie a knot
on the inside, the cable won’t be able to

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.689
pull back out accidentally, and it’ll prevent
the wires from splitting down any further.

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:40.760
So tie it off if you can figure out how to
do it. Otherwise, don’t worry too much about it.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.439
All that’s left to do now, is push the individual
wires through the two remaining tubes, and

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:46.499
secure them to the end caps.

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:50.340
Add a washer to the bolt inside the cap, then
slip the wire loop over the end of the bolt

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.999
and push it down to the bottom.

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:55.919
Add one more washer and a hex nut, then use
something like a pair of needle nose pliers

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:58.180
to help tighten the whole assembly together.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.099
Now simply push the end caps on the tubes
as tightly as you can, and just like that,

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.620
the frame for your wire saw is finished.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.699
You could use it just like this, but if you
want to kick it up a notch, trying using a

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:10.249
bit of Duck Tape to add a splash of color.

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:14.090
The only thing our hot wire foam cutter needs
now, is the hot wire. And for that I’ll

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.180
be using a 1-1/2” extension spring, and
some stainless steel hanger wire, which you’ll

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.209
find, in the hardware isle.

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:25.779
I got a 9 ft roll for a little under $4, which
is way more than I’ll ever need, and should last forever.

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:29.109
Measure the wire so it’s a couple inches
longer than the frame, then go ahead and snip

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.389
it to size, and now here’s the cool part.

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:35.900
If you look closely, you’ll notice the hanger
wire is made of 7 smaller wires twisted together.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.829
So if we unravel them, we end up with 7, super
thin, stainless steel cutting wires. And plenty

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.589
more where they came from.

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:46.529
At this point, go ahead and get the 1-1/2”
extension spring ready, by connecting it to

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:50.419
one of the eye-bolts. The easiest way to connect
it is by pulling the hook open with a pair

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:53.949
of pliers, then looping it inside the bolt
and letting go.

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:57.809
Fasten one end of the steel wire, to the bottom
eye-bolt by folding the wire back over itself

00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:00.150
and twisting it around a few times.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.609
Now loop the other end through the bottom
of the spring. But before you twist it off,

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:06.209
pull the wire firmly, and stretch it out first.

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.349
This will “spring-load” the wire with
tension, which is really important for keeping

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.540
it tight, when it expands and contracts rapidly.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.480
With that final step, the wire cutter’s
done. Except you might have noticed, the wire’s still a bit wavy.

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.360
Simply take a screw, or the handle of a spoon,
and slide it back and forth a few times to

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.450
make the ripples disappear.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.600
Now let’s do a quick and simple test to
make sure everything got connected properly,

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.260
by touching the ends of the wires, to the
terminals of the lantern battery.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.640
If you did it right and your connections are
solid, the wire will heat up and slice through

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.280
styrofoam, without any trouble at all.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.750
Ok now that we’ve got a wire cutting blade,
let’s go ahead and build the foam cutting

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.930
factory I designed to go with it.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.530
The first thing you’re going to need is
1/2” medium density fiberboard (MDF) cut 18” square.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.520
We’ll also need an 8 foot 2x4”, which
you can get for about $2.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.520
I’m using a chop-saw to make quick and clean
cuts, but you can use whatever tools work best for you.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.430
But in any case, you’ll need to cut the
first piece 18” long. Then a 15” piece

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.810
for the side. Another 15” piece for the
bottom. Followed by an 11-1/2” piece for the other side.

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.600
A 5” block fills the gap above that. Followed
by a 3-1/2” block on the bottom left. Then

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.050
another 3-1/2” block that’ll go inside,
on the bottom right, a little later on.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.190
Now that our 2x4” is cut, mark a 10” line
down the center of the MDF square, and use

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.240
something like a chop saw to follow the line
from the center marking, right out the side.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.020
You’ll see what this groove is for a little
later.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.670
Alright, it’s time to secure the blocks
together, and for that I’m using eight,

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.600
3” wood screws, and an 1/8” drill bit.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.160
Start by lining all the blocks in position,
on the bottom of the board, then use the 1/8”

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.960
bit to drill pilot holes in the wood. This
way, the wood won’t crack when you screw it together.

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.100
The blocks go together in 3 different segments,
and you should be able to figure out how to

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.450
attach them, by studying how I did mine.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:49.190
Before we go any further, let’s stop, and
hack a square hole out of the 15” sidewall,

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.820
to accommodate the dimmer switch we’ll be
adding in just a minute.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.090
I used a 3/8” bit to drill holes in the
corners, then connected the dots with a jig

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.870
saw, to cut the sides, and pop the block out.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.560
If you did it right, your hole will be on
the left side of the base, when the 18” board is facing forward.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.960
Ok let’s move onto securing the work-surface
next.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.670
We’ll need to drill pilot holes through
the MDF like we did for the base frame, and

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:16.150
it’s a good idea to invest in a countersink
bit, so you can get the heads of the screws to drop below the surface.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:21.170
I used ten, 1-1/2” wood screws to hold the
board to the 2x4’s, and two, 3” wood screws

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:26.250
in the upper right area, to secure the 3-1/2”
reinforcing block, to the underside of the table.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.480
These are the measurements I used, and it’s
important you take time to measure and fasten

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:34.020
yours the same way, because it’s all part
of a master plan, that will come together later on.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.480
Now just for fun, I thought it would be a
good idea to use my flush-mount router station

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.450
to quickly clean up the edges a bit, by rounding
them out.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.520
For just a little extra effort, you can see
what an amazing difference it makes. And all

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.460
I used was a 1/2” rounding bit.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.800
If you want to see how I made this router
station, look for how to build it, in another project video.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.970
Alright, let’s make sure all the wood pieces
fit together snugly, on the underside, then

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.980
double-check the base support assembly didn’t
get screwed on. That’s important.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.590
We still have one thing left to do with the
base support, and that’s to drill a 3/8”

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.900
hole directly in the center, and 5” from
the bottom. That’s it. At this point the workstation is finished.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.600
Now just for looks, I decided to spray-paint
mine black, so it would match my wire saw

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.870
better, but however you color yours, is completely
up to you.

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:18.310
The next step in assembling our foam cutting
factory is attaching the arm assembly, to the support base.

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:22.320
Stand the saw upright so it looks like the
letter “C”, and center it in the middleof the board.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.720
Now if you push a pen through the hole in
the back, and mark the tubing, you can use

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.530
your 3/8” drill bit to carefully cut a matching
hole right through the tube.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:32.930
Make sure you don’t cut the wires inside,
and put something like a scrap piece of wood

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.510
underneath, so you don’t scratch up your
table when the drill finally punches through.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:42.460
Let’s fasten the two parts together next,
using a 3/8” x 3-1/2” hex bolt. Two 5/16”

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:49.280
cut washers/ A 3/8” wing nut/ And two 5/16”
tank bolt washers, which you’ll find in the plumbing section.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:54.060
The bolt, and one washer, go on the forward
side of the tubing, while the two tank  go on the back.washers

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.610
And after inserting the bolt all the way through
the hole in the support stand, add one more

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:00.730
washer and a wing nut, to clamp the system
together.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:04.020
The wing nut simply needs to be screwed on
hand-tight, and with that final addition,

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:09.560
you’ve just completed a stand-alone cutting
assembly, that looks awesome, and has a of really cool features. lot

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.950
The cutting arm is designed to pivot on the
bolt, so you can adjust the angle of the blade

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:15.120
anyway you need it, and even 180 degrees the
other way.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.620
If that’s not enough, you can release the
wing-nut and slide the whole assembly out,

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.870
to cut larger blocks free-handed.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:23.860
Now to bring our Styro-Slicer to life we just
need a way to safely electrify it, and control

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:26.860
the power, so let’s finish up, with the
electrical system, next.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:32.320
I went to the hardware store and got a 600
watt dimmer switch, that you can turn on or off just by pushing it.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:38.400
We’re also going to need a 12 volt power
transformer, a 10 amp fuse and another 6’ length of cord.

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:41.959
Now if you have trouble finding a transformer,
or simply don’t want to shell out for one,

00:08:41.959 --> 00:08:45.709
you’ll probably be able to salvage one for
free, by hacking open an old stereo and pulling

00:08:45.709 --> 00:08:50.819
one off the power supply. That’s what I
did for my first prototype, and it works just as well.

00:08:50.819 --> 00:08:55.559
The dimmer switch goes in position from the
outside, and gets secured in place, with two 1” wood screws.

00:08:55.569 --> 00:08:59.339
You’ll need a cover plate as well to make
it look nice, and when that’s screwed on,

00:08:59.339 --> 00:09:02.329
replace the knob, then flip the whole workstation
over.

00:09:02.329 --> 00:09:07.009
I decided to install my transformer about
halfway down the side, and used two more 1”

00:09:07.009 --> 00:09:09.470
screws to secure it as tightly against the
top, as I could get it.

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:12.980
And it helps if you position the side with
the 3 wires, facing down.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:16.839
The 10 amp fuse isn’t really necessary,
but it’s good practice to have in place

00:09:16.839 --> 00:09:20.699
just in-case of a short, so make sure it’s
actually got a fuse inside, then go ahead

00:09:20.699 --> 00:09:25.059
and connect everything together, using the
small wire nuts that came with the dimmer switch.

00:09:25.059 --> 00:09:28.490
Now to save time, I went ahead and just wired
everything together. And after you do the

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:30.670
same, it should look something like this.

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:34.370
You can see the main power cord comes in from
the outlet and connects to the 10 amp fuse

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:37.870
first, which then connects to the black wire
on the dimmer switch next.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:41.100
The red wire coming out of the dimmer switch
connects to the black cord on the primary

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:45.800
side of the transformer, and the other black
cord connects to the wire running back to the outlet.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:50.560
Now on the secondary side of the transformer,
you might have noticed two yellow wires and one black one.

00:09:50.569 --> 00:09:55.019
The two yellow wires supply 12 volts, and
the black wire is center-tapped for half power.

00:09:55.019 --> 00:09:58.540
This means that connecting them to a 3 position
switch will give us the option to cycle the

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:02.939
system between 0 volts, 6 volts and 12 volts,
on demand.

00:10:02.939 --> 00:10:05.800
Now it doesn’t really matter which yellow
wire you connect to the switch, as long as

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.100
it’s soldered to one side, with the black
wire soldered to the other.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:13.269
The remaining yellow wire needs to be connected
to the cord running to the hot wire assembly.

00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:16.889
And the return wire, connects back to the
middle, of the 3 position switch.

00:10:16.889 --> 00:10:20.139
It sounds complicated, but it’s really not
that bad once you get into it.

00:10:20.139 --> 00:10:24.160
Now the two power cords are designed to feed
out the back, so they don’t get in the way.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.920
One cord is for the supply power, that gets
plugged into any regular power outlet. And

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.490
the other cord, runs the regulated power to
the cutter assembly.

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:35.160
At this point, the Styro-Slicer is done, and
ready to use as soon as you are.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:39.009
Simply push the cutting arm into place, with
the wire in the center of the work surface,

00:10:39.009 --> 00:10:42.699
then flip the red switch to the 6 volt setting,
which I call “normal power”.

00:10:42.699 --> 00:10:46.910
Push the dimmer switch on, then gently crank
up the power, and you’re in business.

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:50.220
If everything’s working the way it should,
your wire will instantly heat up, and you

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:56.300
can start slicing through styrofoam right
away. Making some of the smoothest, and cleanest cuts, you can imagine.

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.899
For one final touch, I added a couple 1”
screws to the inside of the base, so we can

00:10:59.899 --> 00:11:03.899
store the rest of the hanger wire, then secured
a latch on the upper side of the support stand,

00:11:03.899 --> 00:11:07.329
so the whole system locks together, for quick
and easy storage.

00:11:07.329 --> 00:11:10.740
By the way, there’s also a backup battery
cable in there, that will connect the system

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:15.589
to solar, or battery power, which makes the
whole system portable, and off the grid.

00:11:15.589 --> 00:11:19.730
Well now you know how to rise up, and become
a master styrofoam maker, by building yourself

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:20.939
a homemade Styro-Slicer.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.509
That gives you precision control for cutting
custom props like a Mini Master Sword. Or

00:11:25.509 --> 00:11:31.049
slicing out something more intricate, like
a squadron of 3D fighter jets. Look for how to make these in another video.

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:35.210
Well that’s it for now. If you liked this
project, perhaps you’ll like some of my others.
