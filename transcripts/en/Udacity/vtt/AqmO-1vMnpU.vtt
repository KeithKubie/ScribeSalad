00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.740
So switching over to Android Studio,

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.080
I've created a little app to demonstrate
extracting a pallet from an image.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.350
The first thing we need to do in our
apps file is add the support library for

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.520
a pallet as a dependency.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.550
So after we receive an image
resource identifier for

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.430
an image, we can load it into our
view and convert it into a bitmap

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.570
that the palette will use to
generate the color swatches.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.650
Alternatively, If we've taken a photo,
we'll receive a bitmap from

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.200
the camera without the need for
that conversion step.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.700
These color swatches fall into two
different areas, either vibrant or

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.130
a muted color.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.820
The type and

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.470
number of swatches is dependent
on the composition of your image.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.520
And how much of it is
in a certain color and

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.040
how that color contrast to
other colors in the image.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.880
If you want to read more about that,
you can check the instructors notes for

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.870
a link to the java docs,
for the palette library.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.200
So right here in this code, I take
the palette and I'm looking through

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.000
all of the different swatches to see if
they exist before returning a hash mat.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.900
So let's check it out on a device.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.950
If we hit this floating action
button and pick an image,

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.790
let's pick something from our
Android Nanodegree kick off.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.908
We can see that it's
created a palette for us.

00:01:16.908 --> 00:01:19.715
Now, one of the interesting colors here

00:01:19.715 --> 00:01:22.865
is this vibrant color from
these Android stickers.

00:01:22.865 --> 00:01:27.095
When I click the item it shows
us how many pixels in the image

00:01:27.095 --> 00:01:29.205
were from that color.

00:01:29.205 --> 00:01:31.695
Next, Roman is going to talk
to you about typography.
