00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:03.336
So please welcome Marley Dias,
everybody!

00:00:03.369 --> 00:00:05.305
-♪ ♪
-(cheering and applause)

00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:09.642
Marley!

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:11.244
-Hey, Marley!
-Nice to meet you.

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:13.613
Have a seat right here.

00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:19.118
I know. Awesome.

00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:21.454
Uh, so great to have you here.

00:00:21.487 --> 00:00:22.989
-Thank you.
-Such a cool story.

00:00:23.022 --> 00:00:25.725
So, you were reading, uh,
stories about white boys

00:00:25.758 --> 00:00:27.927
-and their dogs. Right?
-Yes.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.129
So explain that to me,
how that inspired you.

00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:32.065 line:0%
So, it really did,
because I was reading, um,

00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:34.200 line:0%
<i> Where the Red Fern Grows </i>
by Wilson Rawls,

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:36.669 line:0%
I was reading the<i> Shiloh</i> series,
and I read<i> Old Yeller,</i>

00:00:36.702 --> 00:00:38.604 line:0%
-and, basically,<i> Where the... </i>
-Right.<i> Old Yeller,</i>

00:00:38.637 --> 00:00:41.841 line:0%
-really, really sad. Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah, it is.

00:00:41.874 --> 00:00:44.110
But I read, um,<i> Where the Red
 Fern Grows,</i> and that's about

00:00:44.143 --> 00:00:46.646
a boy who saves his money
to buy a dog to help him hunt.

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:49.582
And then the<i> Shiloh</i> series
is about a boy who finds a dog

00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:51.818
-and uses him on a farm. And<i> Old
 Yeller</i> is about a boy -Right.

00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:53.986
-who finds a dog and
then uses him on a farm. -Yeah.

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.322
So they were all really
the same.

00:00:56.355 --> 00:00:58.491
-But I noticed that when I went
home and read the books -Yeah.

00:00:58.524 --> 00:01:00.426
that I wanted to, like,
about black girls,

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:02.562
they were all different. Like,
sometimes I was reading about

00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:04.430
student council. Sometimes
I was reading about a girl

00:01:04.463 --> 00:01:06.833
who went to Africa.
So it was always different.

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.901
-It was never, like, the same
plot I was hearing over -Yeah.

00:01:08.934 --> 00:01:10.903
-and over. -And these books
weren't in your schools.

00:01:10.936 --> 00:01:13.306
-They weren't in my school, no.
-Right. Man, interesting.

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:15.441
-And-and your name is Marley.
That's such a cool name. -Yes.

00:01:15.474 --> 00:01:17.376
-Were you named after Bob
Marley? Really? -Yes, my mother

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.313
is Jamaican, so she named me
after Bob Marley.

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:22.982
Wow, that is amazing,
'cause it's-it's ironic...

00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:25.518
-(cheering and applause)
-Well, they're clapping.

00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:28.121
What's ironic to me is
that there's actually a movie

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:30.523
called<i> Marley and Me </i>
about a white boy and his dog.

00:01:30.556 --> 00:01:33.126
-Yes, I know.
-It's kind of ironic, you know?

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.128
Have you ever thought
of collecting 1,000 movies

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:36.996
and giving them out to schools?

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:39.065
Yes. That would be an idea.

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:40.933
So let me ask you a question.
So why do you think

00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:43.603
it is important to read a book
with someone who's like you?

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:46.405
Like, what was it that really
made that important to you?

00:01:46.438 --> 00:01:49.942
Well, it really was because when
you read a story about a person

00:01:49.975 --> 00:01:52.478
that you can connect with...
So, like, you host a TV show.

00:01:52.511 --> 00:01:55.214
-Yeah. -So, if you were to read
a book about a black man

00:01:55.247 --> 00:01:57.350
who hosts a TV show,
then you would remember

00:01:57.383 --> 00:02:01.420
-whatever he learned so you
could use it on the show. -What?

00:02:01.453 --> 00:02:04.957
-Could you go collect some
of those books, maybe? -Yes.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.493
Could the, uh... could the black
late-night host have a dog?

00:02:07.526 --> 00:02:09.829
Maybe, yeah. If you want.

00:02:09.862 --> 00:02:13.032
Um, how-how surprised were you
that there were so many books?

00:02:13.065 --> 00:02:14.767
'Cause you collected... How
many books have you collected?

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.170
-Uh, about 1,000. -Were
you surprised how many books

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:19.372
-there were out there?
-Yes. I knew that there was

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:21.240
a lot of children's books,
because when you're a kid,

00:02:21.273 --> 00:02:23.242
they push reading so much,
for you to learn all that stuff.

00:02:23.275 --> 00:02:25.511
But when you get older, like,
books become, like, scarce,

00:02:25.544 --> 00:02:27.213
and you only read
normally one type.

00:02:27.246 --> 00:02:30.082
So I was like, "Whoa, I didn't
know that I was missing out

00:02:30.115 --> 00:02:33.019
on so many books in my school."
But... Because when I get older,

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:35.421
I just kind of have to read
book club books about white boys

00:02:35.454 --> 00:02:37.924
and their dogs, and it just
kind of... it becomes, like,

00:02:37.957 --> 00:02:40.459
-all of my day. So... -I bet
there's a book club out there.

00:02:40.492 --> 00:02:42.795
"All right, this is the White
Boy, Dog Book Club, everybody.

00:02:42.828 --> 00:02:46.399
Uh, today's book,
<i> White Boy and His Dog."</i>

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:47.934
Have you...
What has been the action...

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:49.602
the reaction with
your classmates and everything?

00:02:49.635 --> 00:02:51.604
-Well, they've been really proud
of me. -Oh, cool.

00:02:51.637 --> 00:02:53.539
So they've been, like,
high-fiving me and saying,

00:02:53.572 --> 00:02:56.209
"Congrats on your 1,000.
I hope you get 1,000 more."

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:57.877
So they've been
really supportive for me.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.112
Have any white boys with dogs
congratulated you?

00:03:00.145 --> 00:03:02.515
-Yes, actually, they have.
-Really?

00:03:02.548 --> 00:03:05.184
Because sometimes they're sick
of reading those stories, too.

00:03:05.217 --> 00:03:06.519
That's hilarious.

00:03:06.552 --> 00:03:07.720
They're like, "Finally!

00:03:07.753 --> 00:03:09.922
-Finally, a different story!"
-Yeah.

00:03:09.955 --> 00:03:13.392
That's great. Um...

00:03:13.425 --> 00:03:15.595
Uh, now, it's interesting,
'cause, uh,

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:17.897
I love the selflessness
of what you're doing.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.832
-Thank you. -You know, you...
you're getting all these books

00:03:19.865 --> 00:03:21.634
and you're giving them all away,
you know,

00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:23.970
-finding homes for them.
Have you ever, uh, -Yeah.

00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:26.572
found, uh, any books
that you really wanted to keep

00:03:26.605 --> 00:03:29.108
-or hang on to?
-Yes. Like, half of them.

00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:31.110
You haven't secretly,
like, pssh, like,

00:03:31.143 --> 00:03:33.446
-put 'em under your bed, that
kind of thing? -May... Maybe.

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:35.047
Really? Seriously?

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.316
-Yeah.
-It's just between us.

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.453
-Yeah. -What-what
was one of your favorites?

00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:42.855
Well, my favorite-- I have read
it-- it's<i> Brown Girl Dreaming</i>

00:03:42.888 --> 00:03:44.857
-by Jacqueline Woodson.
So, it's a... -Oh, nice.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.059
like, a book in poetry form
about a girl who lives

00:03:47.092 --> 00:03:50.463
in the 1960s and '70s during Jim
Crow laws and stuff like that.

00:03:50.496 --> 00:03:52.932
And she talks about her life
in South Carolina and New York

00:03:52.965 --> 00:03:55.201
-and how it's different and her
family. -Well, that's awesome.

00:03:55.234 --> 00:03:57.870
Look, Marley, we... you know,
we love to keep it 100 here

00:03:57.903 --> 00:04:00.406
on this show. Or as I like
to say, keep it "a-hunned."

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:03.409
Right? So... And you've kept it
100 more than anyone

00:04:03.442 --> 00:04:05.244
in the community, so
we're giving you our brand-new

00:04:05.277 --> 00:04:08.581
-Keep It 100 Gold Award here.
-Oh, my God! Thank you!

00:04:08.614 --> 00:04:10.249
Keep It 100.
It's our highest honor.

00:04:10.282 --> 00:04:12.518
-On behalf of<i> The Nightly Show,</i>
 I want -Thank you so much.

00:04:12.551 --> 00:04:15.521
to give you the first ever
golden 100. Right there.

00:04:15.554 --> 00:04:18.391
And this is for
your-your school administrators

00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:20.793
who didn't have those books.
They get a lot of weak tea.

00:04:20.826 --> 00:04:23.462
-Right there.
You can give that to 'em. -Okay.

00:04:23.495 --> 00:04:26.132
On behalf of<i> The Nightly Show,</i>
 weak tea, okay?

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:27.667
-Thank you.
-Please give it to them.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.336
-Marley Dias, everybody!
-Thank you!

00:04:30.369 --> 00:04:34.302
Marley, thank you so much! Thank
you so much for joining us!
