[Captions by Y Translator]
In today's video,

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.060
we are going to make some
Prince Rupert's Drops,

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.280
and after that, we're going to see if
we can make some in liquid nitrogen,

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.640
and if there's any difference.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:15.020
[Music]

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.300
Guys, I'm Nate.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.309
I'm Calli.

00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:20.340
Today, we are going to be learning
a little bit about Prince Rupert's Drops,

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.830
and Calli has done quite a bit of
practicing and researching about those.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.800
So she's going to be sharing
what she has learned with us.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.240
So here's the basic idea.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.160
We're going to take molten glass,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.620
and drip it into water to see if we can
make some Prince Rupert's drops.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.260
If we can succeed, we're going
to put those through a series

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.880
of tests to test
strength and durability.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.920
After that, we'll try the same
process with liquid nitrogen.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.120
To start us off,
what is a Prince Rupert's Drop?

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.280
So a Prince Rupert's drop is
something that's kind of been

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.519
interesting scientists
for hundreds of years now.

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.920
By taking a piece of molten glass
and dripping it into cool water,

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.700
what happens is the outside
of the glass cools faster than the inside,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.080
causing an incredible internal pressure.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.220
What that means is that
the head of this drop

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.880
that looks like a tadpole
is incredibly strong,

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.640
and can actually even survive bullet blast.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.360
But one flick of the tail, and
the entire thing shatters into dust.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.000
So to get started,
it's actually pretty simple.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.280
This is a torch.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.840
It is MAPP gas.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.780
So this is something that you can
pick up at a local hardware store.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.230
But of course, adult supervision.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.100
MAPP gas burns hotter
than propane or butane,

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.200
and that's why we're using it here.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.660
We really want to be able
to heat up the glass really well,

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.520
and keep it at that temperature

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.200
until right when it goes into the water.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.400
We have some glass rods here.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.640
Also, very simple to find it a craft store,

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.340
lampworking glass
for bead making,

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.400
and then, a pitcher of water.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.480
We also have some Dollar Store glass,
just because we wanted to test it.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.060
So the best results
that I found so far,

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.340
while there are many
types of glass in the world,

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.080
is going to be soda-lime glass,

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.300
which is the most common,
and usually used in lampworking,

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.480
bead making, and glass blowing.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.260
Let's start with a pretty clear piece, just
make it as easy on ourselves as we can.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.740
So don't let your tank touch the water.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.500
If you do when you move this,

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.380
it can cause ripples,

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.200
and those ripples
can also disturb the tail.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.640
You disturb the tail while it's cooling,

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.220
the whole thing will shatter.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.840
Focus the heat on the
bead of your glass, not the tail.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.960
And there we go.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.260
Our first drop of the day.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.780
In your experience trying
to make so many of these,

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.320
what is your approximate
success percentage?

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.320
So I don't want to discourage anyone,

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.000
but it's usually about 3 out of 10
when it comes to the colored glasses,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.260
and what I think that might be is
from the impurities from the metal

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.800
oxides that are involved.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.040
When it comes to the clear ones,
almost an 80% success rate.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.460
As another warning,

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.860
Prince Rupert's drop are,
as we said, highly explosive.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.560
Now, that sounds a little extreme,

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.460
but they do sometimes
combust just on their own.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.340
So I like to keep them in
a container at least with walls.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.380
That way, say if one does decide to
break on us while we're making others,

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.300
your cleanup isn't so bad.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.800
So you'll notice with the
larger Prince Rupert's drops,

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.600
the tails are much more rigid.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.840
With these ones,

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.200
you can kind of even see that it's got
some bounce to it, some flexibility,

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.440
but down in this area,
where it starts to get very rigid,

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.919
you snap that,
this whole thing's gone.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:49.900
[Music]

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.160
All right, so I've got five, which should
be enough for some experiments.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.699
Nate, you want to make some?

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.320
So, a couple of things
to note while we're doing this.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.740
I have Nate with his leg out to stabilize
the glass rod as he's working.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.060
The reason why is as the drop falls,

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.340
we don't want that tail
disturbed as it hits the water.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.620
Do not disturb the water.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.820
Do not disturb the water.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.620
If you do decide to try
and make these at home,

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.640
if you hear a very slight noise
as it hits the water,

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.340
like a hiss but nothing else,

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.440
it probably didn't take.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.700
What you really want is
a very awful popping noise

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.440
as soon as it hits the water,

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.360
that's usually the signal that
you have a successful drop.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:42.060
[Music]

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.280
It's super full of bubbles right now.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.220
So that's the problem I was having with
anything that was a red or gold color.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.350
I don't think it likes the gold oxide.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.560
Two successful,
and more than two unsuccessful,

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.420
but those shattered so badly that
they don't even have tails coming out.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.580
But hey, you did it.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.970
Okay, the glass rods, we got
some pretty good results with.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.280
These are all probably real
Prince Rupert's drops.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.060
We have a little bit of this glass we got
from the dollar store.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.320
Does this work?

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.120
So far, I have not got
Dollar Store glass to work.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.280
I'm not sure if it's because
it's full of other impurities,

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.300
or if it's a different type of glass.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.240
Or a silicates in particular,

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.840
which is normally you're cooking
ware in your kitchen tends to shatter.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.440
You can make a drop, but usually it won't
break when you break the tail.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.980
So it's not a true Prince Rupert's drop,

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.360
but I'm curious to see if we can
at least try to make one with these.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.780
So the first thing that we're going to do
is get rid of this base here.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.100
Now, in the past
when I've attempted this,

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.440
it tends to shatter.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.280
So we're going to do it over the fire pit.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.880
[Music]

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.420
Maximum power!

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.120
Aha!

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.440
It's melting.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.240
No break is this time.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.440
Good.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.480
I want to set of wine glasses
that looks like that.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.300
Modern Art made easy.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.820
Is that not very very hot?

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:06.540
No.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.640
If you get it hot, I might be
able to just cut right through it.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:10.760
There you go.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.980
[Music]

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.960
Yeah.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.000
Well, it's not much to work with,
but let's try.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.520
So the first thing that I'm noticing

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.240
is this is not reacting
like our glass rods from before.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.540
I'm not sure if this isn't soda-lime glass,

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:31.760
or if it's just really impure.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.520
This is acting more like, I would
assume a borosilicate would.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:41.480
[Music]

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.040
Nope, not at all.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.680
Just shattered on impact.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.980
We've now had many successful
Prince Rupert's drops just in the water,

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.440
but I know a ton of you
want to see what happens

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.040
if we try and make them in liquid nitrogen.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.240
So we've got liquid nitrogen.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.140
We're going to see if we can make some
Prince Rupert's drops in liquid nitrogen,

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.540
if they form the same way,
if they look the same,

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.340
and if they behave the same
way after they're formed.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.340
If we can even get them to form at all.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.180
Now, this is the piece of glass that we've
had the most success with so far.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.680
I'm pretty sure again that because of the
lack of impurities in it.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.460
So that's what we're going to try first

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:21.080
to hopefully make a successful
Prince Rupert's drop in the liquid nitrogen.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:27.960
[Music]

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.060
I yanked it.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.310
[Music]

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.160
Moment of truth.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.060
Yes.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.320
Woo!

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.960
It's actually looks like it's shattered,
but stayed in place.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.760
So I don't think this one's
gonna work very well.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.980
But this is interesting.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:49.740
I've seen videos online where people have
dropped molten glass into liquid nitrogen.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:53.540
The main difference that you see
when you drip molten glass into the water

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.220
is that it forms a
small bubble on the inside.

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.380
Normally, when they drop
into liquid nitrogen,

00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:59.330
you don't get that.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.700
Now this one looks like it's full of bubbles.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.580
So as Calli was handing this to me,

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.120
the tail broke off,
kind of right where we were saying,

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.860
it looked like a separated.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:09.110
But it didn't explode.

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:11.560
If that happens to
a real Prince Rupert's drop,

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.440
I wouldn't be holding anything.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.600
Or if I was holding anything,
it would just be a pile of glass dust.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.620
In this case, the tail broke off.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:20.500
So clearly not a Prince Rupert's drop,

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.260
but we got something
formed in liquid nitrogen.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:23.520
Let's try a few more times.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:30.660
[Music]

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.880
The winds picked up
and that changes everything.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:35.940
No!

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:36.920
No!

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.360
We have a few.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.380
Some failures.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.720
This tail has nothing attached to it.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.880
This was cool.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.760
These were Cobalt a minute ago,

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.440
but you can actually
watch the frost as it forms.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.270
I don't know what is going on here.

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:54.750
I think one dripped and touch the other tails.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:55.890
I think it did.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.240
I think this was the last one,

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.120
and it's probably still like
warm or something.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.980
&gt;&gt; Yep. It's still warm.
&gt;&gt; Yeah don't. Yeah.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.660
It was in liquid nitrogen.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.440
That's how hot molten glasses.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.880
So you want to be really careful
when you're making these.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.180
That was in liquid nitrogen, still hot.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.680
So at a glance, you can already see.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.580
This is the drop that we put into water,

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.560
and there are a few tiny
little bubbles in there.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:21.600
But this is the drop that
we put into liquid nitrogen.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.260
No bubbles to be seen, and it's
actually more of a uniform shape.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.940
So here's another difference that I'm seeing.

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:29.820
This is one that we dripped into water,

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.820
and you can actually
see again that deformation,

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.180
that's pretty common in Prince Rupert's drops.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.840
But this one,

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.040
although it did shatter on
impact in the liquid nitrogen,

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.940
it held together.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.580
One of the defining characteristics
of a Prince Rupert's drop

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:47.900
is that it's very tough on the head,

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.680
but if you clip the tail

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.840
anywhere where it's not flexible,

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.820
it will shatter,

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:54.960
and it doesn't just break into pieces,

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.140
it turns like to dust
and almost instantaneously.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:59.600
So that's what I'm going to do on this one.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.040
[Music]

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.800
That went everywhere.

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:08.040
I think that shot glass dust for like 20 feet.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.440
That shot the gazebo.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.440
I felt it just like a shower
of glass powder hitting my face.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.589
So, and that happens so so quickly.

00:10:16.589 --> 00:10:19.480
So now let's try Prince Rupert's drop
from the liquid nitrogen,

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.940
and if you take a look at it,

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:25.140
absolutely no imperfections
and no bubbles.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.420
Clipping off the tail.

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:29.660
[Music]

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:30.460
Nothing.

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:31.960
The tail broke.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.560
Try closer.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:39.340
[Music]

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.320
So we have a drop of glass.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.900
Yes, but we definitely don't
have a Prince Rupert's drop.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:47.600
It cooled down,
it kept its drop shape and it's neat.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.700
But with the real Prince Rupert's drops,

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.400
you clip the tail,
they explode into dust.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.560
The liquid nitrogen drops,

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.640
they just break
wherever you break them.

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.280
I still want to know how this is
going to handle a hammer blow.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:00.900
&gt;&gt;Ready?
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:04.960
So that was a pretty light hit,

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.660
and it didn't shatter the whole thing.

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:08.770
But it broke a lot of pieces off of it.

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:11.700
I would say that this is
probably regular glass,

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.960
maybe like a marble honestly.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.500
This should be a real true
Prince Rupert's drop.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.740
There you go.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:21.340
It explode so we much.

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:24.480
Okay, this little piece came
from the liquid nitrogen so...

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.880
[Music]

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:28.900
Harder.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.100
You broke it.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:32.220
So the problem with this

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:37.350
is that there's actually only 10%
of this drop that is incredibly strong.

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:39.060
Other than that,

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:42.400
there are these little tiny bubbles
really close to the surface,

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:45.720
and these are the ones we dropped
into water, so they are stronger.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:49.260
[Music]

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.540
Did not absorb all the impact.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:52.780
Tail still got crushed.

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:55.430
But you can see how fine
of a dust that turns into.

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:57.620
It really caught most of the thing as it exploded.

00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.980
We've tried smashing these
with a hammer a few times,

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.880
and we've gotten some
good hammer strikes,

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.600
but in the end there keeps being
too much vibration on the tails.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.080
So let's try putting these in our vice.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:12.120
[Music]

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.620
You're so scared, aren't you?

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.000
I am terrified of this.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:23.360
[Music]

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.500
Did it dent the vice?

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.760
I think it did, like the knurling on it.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.350
I think that right there.

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:29.760
I mean, I'm sorry about the vice,

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.550
but that makes me so happy
that they're that strong.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.860
I also wonder
if you had it a little bit lower.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:38.460
So it was close to
the tip as you can get it,

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:41.200
because that's where
that 10% strength is.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:52.380
[Music]

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:53.140
Okay.

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:56.060
I'm gonna like hang off of it.

00:12:56.060 --> 00:13:03.680
[Music]

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:07.480
So you'll actually see that
I've managed to dent the knurling.

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:11.320
Now, these are actually
exploding fairly quickly,

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.370
and my only thought
on that is it's probably

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:16.280
because there isn't
even pressure all the time.

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.780
So I think that probably has
something to do with the fact

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:21.480
these are shattering the way they are.

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:23.680
So what we've seen here
with the bench vice

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.340
is that we can put as much
pressure on these as possible.

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.780
I'm actually hanging off of this thing.

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:32.480
There's a couple of shots where
we've got me like all of my weight,

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.040
and I'm hanging off of it.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.120
But as soon as I let up the pressure,

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.989
not move it but let up the pressure,

00:13:37.989 --> 00:13:40.110
that's when we're getting the...

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:43.340
It's not really a flashpoint,
that's just when it starts to combust.

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.460
It just explodes as soon
as the pressure changes on it.

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:49.800
That might be because there's
lower pressure on it suddenly.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:54.500
It might be that the inside of this vice
has some sort of jagged knurling,

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.200
and as we let up on the pressure,

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.460
it shifts slightly until
you know, a point is kind of

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.160
digging into the glass
or scraping it sideways.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.040
But it is interesting

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.020
because while we're
putting constant pressure on it,

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:06.660
it pretty much doesn't explode

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:10.200
until we let go or try
and release the pressure.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.800
And if anybody's making this
at home and wants to break them,

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.920
we've already got scratches
on our glasses,

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:19.300
and a couple of nicks on our face.

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.300
So wear protection if you're doing this,

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.340
like be really really careful.

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:26.660
These things,
when they shatter,

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:27.870
they shatter hard.

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:30.560
Hey guys, you've probably noticed that

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.360
since we introduced Calli
in our Captain America shield video,

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.200
every new video has had
secret codes, and graphic glitches,

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.520
and other secret elements hidden into it.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:42.020
Keep track of what you see,
and the timestamps of when you see it.

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:43.800
We've got some big prizes to give away,

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.750
and finding the codes
might make you our next winner.
