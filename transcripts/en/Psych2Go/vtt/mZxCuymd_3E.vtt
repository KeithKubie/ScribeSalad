00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.180
You often hear the famous phrase "you learn something new every day," right?

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.299
Well, what if I told you that your mind warps new ideas to fit with your older beliefs?

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.810
Now, don't get me wrong, you are learning new things every day that help shape you as a person.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:35.979
Sometimes you feel confident in these new things you've learned; however, we can't avoid sometimes falling under the Dunning-Kruger effect,

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.410
a cognitive bias.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.960
Not sure what this is? Well, the Dunning-Kruger effect is when people with very little knowledge on a topic

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:50.378
tend to significantly overestimate themselves; while, more intelligent people underestimate their knowledge.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.949
As an example, have you ever walked into a classroom the day of an exam with an unprecedented sense of confidence,

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.760
Despite not having studied a lot the night before? or perhaps you were just the opposite. You studied all night long,

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:09.309
But upon sitting down to take the test, suddenly you feel as if there were things you might have forgotten to review.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.369
Late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel's "Lie Witness" news segments further exemplify this...

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:22.989
The segment consists of a crew asking random Pedestrians questions that have false premises placed in. for example,

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.379
Asking people their opinion on a band that doesn't exist.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.890
The lengths to which some people go describing how much they love that band, that doesn't really exist, is breathtaking.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.460
That's just one example of the dunning-kruger effect set in motion.

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:43.539
It makes sense if you think about it. No one wants to appear clueless about something they claim to enjoy in front of a camera.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:51.040
And the confidence we pull out to make us seem knowledgeable on something we know very little about can be very convincing, even to ourselves.

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:58.449
It's easy for our brains to say I understand this based on the clutter of meaningless information stored in our head.

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.868
The connections made in our mind sometimes even managed to fool ourselves into not recognizing our own ignorance.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.380
This meaningless information can often consist of misconceptions that we've gained over time.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.340
These misconceptions never really leave us -- even if we know they're wrong.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.820
In fact, we can often bend, or outright forget, new information to make it fit with previous information.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.529
So how do we recognize, and more importantly, avoid falling into the dunning-kruger effect?

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.330
Well, we should all strive to educate ourselves as much as possible.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.800
After all it isn't a bad thing to learn theories and ideas.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.220
Theory will only take you so far though, and testing things in a controlled environment isn't always possible.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.650
This means you won't always be 100% prepared for situations you might think you learned how to deal with.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.240
And that's ok, you aren't expected to know everything...

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.600
After just learning the basics. In fact, you're encouraged to keep learning,

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.759
To keep questioning, and to consider how your own thinking can be flawed, or misguided.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:09.739
Coming to terms with the things we don't understand is the first step towards clearing up misunderstandings, and learning new things.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.619
As Socrates said, "True wisdom comes to each of us when we realize how little we understand about life,"

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.249
"Ourselves, and the world around us." Thank you for watching, and don't forget to subscribe to Psych2Go
