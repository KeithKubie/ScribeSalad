Remember how the Google repository
provided access to a number of

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.520
Google services, but
in order to use them we needed to

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.320
be certain that the user's device
had the STK up to date and enabled.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.100
You want to check that this is true
before attempting to make a call to

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.450
any Google services.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.290
And more importantly you want
to build in graceful failures.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.200
So do you recall how when we were
learning Google Cloud Messaging I

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.960
mentioned that there were two
approaches to doing this check?

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.190
For GCM we check if the SDK is available
when the app activity is created.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.070
And if so,
we register to receive messages.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.740
But if this registration doesn't happen,

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.870
the user never gets
a severe weather alert.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.620
But they also never know that they
are missing out on the feature.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.560
The other approach was to
perform the check at the moment

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.710
when you are about to make the API call.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.140
And this could allow you to display
different layouts depending on

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.810
the results of that call.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.610
And that is just what we want to do for
the place's API integration.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.820
Ideally, a user should not even know
that they may be missing out on

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.950
the place picker.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.240
That means that we need
to structure our UI so

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.420
this features only appears
to users who can use it.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.170
So, let's take at how we can build
our location preference dynamically.
