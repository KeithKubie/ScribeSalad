stay up Malcolm in the eye with a pen or

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670
stay up Malcolm in the eye with a pen or
 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.149
stay up Malcolm in the eye with a pen or
pencil a pen is more interesting to me a

dog when he first told me that he wanted

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170
dog when he first told me that he wanted
 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.889
dog when he first told me that he wanted
to do something like this he recommended

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899
to do something like this he recommended
 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:55.940
to do something like this he recommended
it you're like getting stabbed in the

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950
it you're like getting stabbed in the
 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.199
it you're like getting stabbed in the
eye and I thought there's something else

00:01:57.199 --> 00:01:57.209
eye and I thought there's something else
 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:59.359
eye and I thought there's something else
interesting we could probably do but

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369
interesting we could probably do but
 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.130
interesting we could probably do but
then I came up with a kind of a cool

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140
then I came up with a kind of a cool
 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.550
then I came up with a kind of a cool
idea

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560
idea
 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.059
idea
for the eye if we use a pen Doug would

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069
for the eye if we use a pen Doug would
 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:07.279
for the eye if we use a pen Doug would
be a lot of blood gushing and stuff like

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289
be a lot of blood gushing and stuff like
 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.339
be a lot of blood gushing and stuff like
that so I thought it'd be fun idea of

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349
that so I thought it'd be fun idea of
 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.949
that so I thought it'd be fun idea of
when nothing we'd stabbed in the eye you

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959
when nothing we'd stabbed in the eye you
 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.250
when nothing we'd stabbed in the eye you
see the pan and while he's talking to

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260
see the pan and while he's talking to
 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.630
see the pan and while he's talking to
Doug the little the end of the pen pops

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640
Doug the little the end of the pen pops
 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.789
Doug the little the end of the pen pops
off or the cap pops off and blood

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799
off or the cap pops off and blood
 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.699
off or the cap pops off and blood
squirts out of the actual pen in order

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709
squirts out of the actual pen in order
 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.420
squirts out of the actual pen in order
to do that I'm gonna have to build a

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430
to do that I'm gonna have to build a
 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.930
to do that I'm gonna have to build a
latex prosthetic the goal cover-up

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940
latex prosthetic the goal cover-up
 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.539
latex prosthetic the goal cover-up
Malcolm's existing eye and we'll have to

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549
Malcolm's existing eye and we'll have to
 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.449
Malcolm's existing eye and we'll have to
run tubing that we can pump blood

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459
run tubing that we can pump blood
 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.150
run tubing that we can pump blood
through so I'll get a pen just a cheap

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160
through so I'll get a pen just a cheap
 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.690
through so I'll get a pen just a cheap
pen and some clay I'll make a prosthetic

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700
pen and some clay I'll make a prosthetic
 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.360
pen and some clay I'll make a prosthetic
we'll make a mold I'll pour some latex

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370
we'll make a mold I'll pour some latex
 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.949
we'll make a mold I'll pour some latex
into it and then we'll pull it out and

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959
into it and then we'll pull it out and
 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.949
into it and then we'll pull it out and
connect the tubing and stuff like that

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959
connect the tubing and stuff like that
 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.000
connect the tubing and stuff like that
so that we can pump out the blood and

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010
so that we can pump out the blood and
 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.050
so that we can pump out the blood and
stuff and yeah it should be interesting

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060
stuff and yeah it should be interesting
 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.360
stuff and yeah it should be interesting
I'm sure I have enough stuff lying

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370
I'm sure I have enough stuff lying
 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.789
I'm sure I have enough stuff lying
around here or I can make something so

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799
around here or I can make something so
 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:15.190

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.680
 
all right so we're gonna sculpt the eye

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690
all right so we're gonna sculpt the eye
 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:25.190
all right so we're gonna sculpt the eye

cup or something like that and cut it
off and glue it on there and we'll make

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590
off and glue it on there and we'll make
 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.580
off and glue it on there and we'll make
a mold using some plaster of Paris I'll

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590
a mold using some plaster of Paris I'll
 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:11.570

mix up real quick
 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.990
mix up real quick
pour it in there the mold should cure in

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000
pour it in there the mold should cure in
 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.729
pour it in there the mold should cure in
about an hour we'll pull out the clay

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739
about an hour we'll pull out the clay
 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.930
about an hour we'll pull out the clay
and then we'll have our prosthetic eye

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940
and then we'll have our prosthetic eye
 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:07:46.510
and then we'll have our prosthetic eye
so yeah let's get to it

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:46.520
 
 

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:51.309

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:50.330
and that'll be it that'll be the puppet
 

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:54.960
and that'll be it that'll be the puppet
so I think it'll look enough like it
