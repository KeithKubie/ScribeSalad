JANICE KEYSER: Welcome,
thank you so much for coming.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.160
I'm Janice Keyser.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.140
I'm one of the site
directors at one

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.340
of the Google
Children's Centers.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.700
And I'm delighted today
to introduce my friend

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.890
and colleague Rona Renner, who
has been working with me on

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.000
and off for several years.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.910
Rona is the co-founder of
Childhood Matters, which

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.810
was a wonderful radio
show in Berkeley

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.910
in English and in
Spanish for 10 years.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:38.360
And she is a consultant, a
writer-- as you can tell--

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.360
and she's been an incredible
resource to both parents

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.650
and educators in the
Bay Area and beyond,

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.050
particularly thinking about both
issues of parenting and also

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.530
who are these children and how
does temperament effect who

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.920
these children are, how
our relationship works.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.610
And it was so
exciting to me when

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.060
she called me and let me
know that she was writing

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.160
this book because
I feel like it's

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.340
going to be such an incredible
resource to families.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.100
The very cool thing is that
Google is supporting in this.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.410
And so Books Inc is at the
back of the room selling

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.550
books for $5.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.920
And people can, and they will
have them in the bookstore

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.970
so that you can,
with your badge,

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.090
go in and buy them for $5
at any point that you want.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.340
For today's Talk, several
people are VCing in.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.060
And if you have questions and
you're VCing in, you can go

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.590
to the link go slash
"Is that Me Yelling?"--

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.430
the title of the book--
and put up questions.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.070
We'll start questions in the
last 15 minutes, 20 minutes,

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.980
so people in the audience
and people who are VCing in

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.250
can submit their questions.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.460
Let's see if there was
anything else I needed to say.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.060
Oh, Rona's probably going to
talk a little bit about this

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.560
too.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.080
But I helped her get
connected with Google Helpout.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.130
So she is a consultant available
on Google Helpouts now as well.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.500
So without further
ado, it's your turn.

00:02:10.582 --> 00:02:12.040
RONA RENNER: It's
great to be here.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.720
And thank you to Janice Keyser.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.920
She and I have worked
together over the years.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.640
She even substituted for
me as the host of my radio

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.910
show a couple of times.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.690
So it's a pleasure
to be here at Google.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.260
And I did get on
Google Helpouts now.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.160
So I'm looking forward to
having some consultations

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.900
there as well.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.780
So I'm going to speak to
you today as a professional.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.110
I'm a temperament specialist
and a parent educator,

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.060
parenting coach.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.780
I'm also a nurse
for about 47 years.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.850
I started when I was very young.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.120
And I love working with parents.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.590
And I'm talking to you as
that professional today,

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.110
and also as a parent.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.690
I have four grown children.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.300
They're all doing wonderful
things in the world.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.200
And even though I
look back and see

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.730
some of the real
challenges we had,

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.550
I want to just give
all of you hope

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.890
if you have young children who
are strong-willed or intense,

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.070
giving you a hard
time once in awhile.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.000
They make for great adults.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.700
And so I have four children
and two grandchildren.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.040
So I speak as a parent
and a professional.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.820
And I wrote this book
in part because parents

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.560
were coming to my classes
that I was teaching,

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.370
and they were saying
a lot, you know,

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.420
I don't know what's going
on, but I'm yelling.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.740
I'm yelling at my kids.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.610
I'm getting more frustrated.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.110
And because I yelled
once in a while--

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.880
I'm not going to say
how much, but it really

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.670
wasn't all that often.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.200
But I didn't like it.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.290
And I thought,
that's a great way

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.680
to focus a book that's
really about mindfulness.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.140
It's really about
getting to know yourself

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.480
and becoming more
aware of yourself.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.240
And it's also about
discipline, which we all

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.460
know means to teach.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.060
And so it's a book
that combines a lot

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.130
of my interests,
especially temperament.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.890
And just in case you don't
know what temperament is,

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.170
it's a person's natural style.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.286
It's the way you
come into the world.

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:14.410
All children are different.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.060
All of you are different.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.019
Some are active,
some are low energy.

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.980
Some of you are sensitive.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.710
Some of you may be shy,
others are extroverts.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.460
So that's what
temperament is about.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.500
And I realize that
if parents looked

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.470
through that lens
of temperament,

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.380
they could understand their kids
so much better and themselves,

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.360
and it could really
reduce power struggles.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.720
So there's a lot of my
book about that as well.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.710
I'm going to read a
little bit from my book.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.650
I'm going to talk with you, and
then I'll take your questions.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.050
This is from the very
beginning, the introduction.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.380
"Some years ago,
my daughter Carina

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.120
was downstairs yelling
at her brother Matt

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.130
to stop bothering her.

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.570
Angrily running to the stairs,
I immediately responded

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:04.700
at the top of my lungs, 'Carina,
stop yelling!' in that moment,

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.970
certainly not the
first of such moments,

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.970
I suddenly heard myself.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.880
Is that me yelling?

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.210
I was appalled.

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.420
I was a nurse, a parenting
expert-- I knew better.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.520
That day, I promised
myself that I

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.780
would try to stop doing
things that I didn't want

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.000
my kids to do,
starting with yelling.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.570
I came to see that my
actions were not always

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.060
the best approach
for my children.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.380
But when I paid attention
and made efforts over time,

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.680
I learned from my mistakes.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.340
After all, I had
stopped smoking,

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.630
and I could stop yelling too.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.820
Parents find themselves
yelling at their kids

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.010
for a lot of reasons.

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.940
Maybe you were
raised by a yeller

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.130
and you can't seem to kick the
habit of letting your feelings

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.920
spill out and land on your kids.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.780
Now you want to rid
yourself of some traditions

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.070
that you just don't
think are healthy for you

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.840
or your family."

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.410
I think that's what happens
when we become parents.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.270
We see all of our traditions,
all of our conditioning,

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.220
and then we have to
decide, what do we think?

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.610
What do we think is best?

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.370
Or perhaps you're
under a lot of stress

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.230
and have temporarily
lost or misplaced

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.010
your compassion,
kindness, and gratitude.

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.700
This happens easily
during parenthood

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.610
even though you've
discovered deep wells of love

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.440
for your children
at the same time.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.840
Since I first became
a parent in 1970,

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.420
I've learned that we
all make mistakes,

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.270
that there's no such
thing as a perfect parent,

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.640
and that parents
love their children.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.810
We have the best of
intentions, but we're all

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.350
limited by what
we know how to do.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:54.200
And so yelling can really be
reduced if you want it to be.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.310
Just thinking about
it will help you.

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.410
Someone just saying looking at
the title of the book helped

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.860
them yell less, just being
remind that, in fact, it's

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.670
a good thing to do
is to yell less.

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:10.860
So I should say something about
what I mean by yelling, right?

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.860
If you're being firm with
your child-- stop jumping

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.760
on the couch now, it's
time to go out and play,

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.940
with that firm, clear
voice, that's not yelling.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.850
That's not what
I'm talking about.

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:28.860
I'm talking about
yelling when you lose it,

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:34.520
when you lose your cool
and the intensity goes up.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.430
Your blood pressure goes up.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.060
You feel your pulse
getting faster,

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.190
your face maybe gets hot.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:42.810
Your fists are clenched.

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:44.720
You know that
feeling a little bit?

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.860
And it's good to identify
what that feels like for you.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.100
And then all of a
sudden, you blow.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:53.570
I've had enough!

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.660
Don't you know
it's time to stop?

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.620
Why can't you ever behave?

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:58.900
I'm sick of this!

00:07:58.900 --> 00:07:59.900
That kind of thing.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.320
It doesn't have to be those
words, but it's that intensity.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:10.670
And of course, what kids
hear is, I'm sick of you,

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.980
not I'm sick of
it, whatever it is.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:18.590
And so kids do take on
a sense that they've

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:22.290
done something wrong but
also that they're bad.

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:24.990
And one of the things we
want to do a lot in parenting

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:29.010
and teaching young
children is differentiating

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:32.380
between a child
who's misbehaving,

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:36.010
that their behavior is not OK--
pulling your sister's hair is

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:40.830
not OK, but it doesn't
make you bad person.

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:44.090
I think it's really important
in child development

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:45.170
to understand that.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:47.610
And a lot of research
has been done

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.530
about how yelling
impacts children, how

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:53.200
it affects children.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.430
Most professionals
agree that yelling

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:59.900
has an impact on a child's
feelings about themselves,

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:01.740
their world, and the
relationships they

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.830
have with their
parents and others.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:08.630
According to psychologist Myrna
Shure, when parents discipline

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:11.330
by yelling and commanding
their children,

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.430
they're more likely that
the children are then

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:17.460
more likely to show physical
or verbal aggression.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.380
These children will
have more difficulty

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:22.550
with positive social
behaviors such as taking

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:25.600
turns and empathizing
with others.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.510
Now I'm going to tell you about
another study that was done.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.510
It came out last year.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.180
And this is with the
University of Pittsburgh.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:37.670
And they followed 967
middle school students.

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:40.370
And there's a lot to yell about
when you have a middle school

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:41.570
student, I have to say.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:45.500
It's a hard time for
students and for parents.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.921
Anyone here have a
middle school student?

00:09:47.921 --> 00:09:48.420
No?

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:49.820
OK.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:50.820
Yeah, they're great.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.700
They should just be out
on a farm somewhere.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.840
I think a farm would be a really
good place for middle school

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.720
students.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.430
Those whose parents used
harsh verbal discipline

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:05.530
such as yelling, cursing,
and using insults

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:09.350
were more likely to be depressed
or have behavior problems.

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:10.965
The research showed this.

00:10:10.965 --> 00:10:14.400
The study found that it
was also not effective

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.060
in getting kids to stop
what they were doing.

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:21.650
In the moment, if
you yell, a child

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:24.530
might stop and do
what you say, right?

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:25.990
They've been trained
if you really

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:27.460
yell loud enough to stop.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:32.460
But it doesn't seem to prevent
them from doing it again.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.230
And I think the key
there is that we're

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:38.035
trying our best as parents
to-- or uncles, some of you

00:10:38.035 --> 00:10:39.660
might be uncles if
you don't have kids,

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:43.600
or aunts-- we're trying
to teach problem solving,

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:48.860
not just put like a
damper on the behavior.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.220
And this study was
very interesting.

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:55.180
It said that even
when children are

00:10:55.180 --> 00:11:00.070
raised in homes that were
generally warm and loving,

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:03.290
they found the
consequences, these effects,

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:06.570
still on these middle
school students.

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:10.900
So the study is suggesting that
even if you're warm and loving,

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:14.700
the yelling or harsh verbal
discipline will still

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.490
have an impact.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:18.170
And I just want to say
something about that.

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:19.940
It's very important
that parents know

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:25.050
it's never too late to
shift your parenting style,

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:27.480
to shift your discipline.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:31.490
You shouldn't feel that
just because I did it

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:34.920
for years means my kid is
hopeless, I'm hopeless,

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.680
and nothing's going to help.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:40.510
I believe that what you do, the
love that you give your kids,

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:44.240
the meals you make,
the fun places you go,

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.460
the times you sit and
read together, how

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.450
you take care of them when
they're sick, all of that

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:51.460
matters.

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:53.900
It really does matter.

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:57.940
And I think what this study is
saying perhaps-- I'm not sure,

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.880
but perhaps-- is that kids
remember though that yelling.

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.570
It really stands out.

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:07.050
And you could think about
it with the relationship

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:11.870
with your partner or
boyfriend, girlfriend, spouse.

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:15.020
If you've had a fight,
if you've had an argument

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:18.330
and they say something that
really hurts your feelings,

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.360
that stays with you.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:24.760
Same thing with a boss,
coworker-- that stays with you.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.600
And they may do
lots of nice things.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.640
But somehow, those hurtful
words stick around.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.440
And now you can repair that.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.510
And I have a part
in my book about how

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:39.380
to repair when, in fact, you
say things that you really

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:41.960
wish you never would have said.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.400
It's possible to
repair relationships.

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.400
But kids remember it.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.970
So the story there
is do your best

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:56.400
to learn how to respond
rather than react.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.980
Most parents are
yellers now and then.

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:02.910
You're not alone and I
think it's really important

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:05.070
to know that you can change.

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:07.280
So how do you do that?

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.710
Well, the first thing I
always ask parents to do

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:12.830
is think about why they yell.

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:14.590
Why am I yelling?

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:16.630
And we won't do the
mic here, but I'll

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:22.030
just ask, if can yell very loud,
some of the reasons you yell.

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:24.120
Who here would like to say?

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.677
Just call out, yeah.

00:13:25.677 --> 00:13:27.010
AUDIENCE: Kids aren't listening.

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:28.468
RONA RENNER: Kids
aren't listening.

00:13:28.468 --> 00:13:30.130
That's one of the main reasons.

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:33.920
Why else do you yell if you
yell, your partner yells maybe?

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:34.990
AUDIENCE: Frustration.

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.520
RONA RENNER: Frustration,
you're tired.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.600
Anyone here have a
little sleep deprivation

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:40.720
going once in a while?

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.620
Yeah.

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:46.190
Your tired, you're frustrated,
kids aren't listening.

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:49.840
Maybe you're really
mad at someone else

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.780
and you're taking
it out on your kid.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:54.260
That happens.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:59.040
People yell sometimes because
they're dealing with trauma.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.680
Maybe someone died
in the family.

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.360
Maybe you're depressed.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.510
You're yelling a
lot of the times

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:09.510
because your
expectations often are

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:11.640
that your child will
do what you say.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:15.300
Especially-- I notice this
a lot with professionals--

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:18.940
they're used to
getting things done.

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:22.000
High level professionals
get things done.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.170
You ask a co-worker
to do something,

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:25.790
and often they'll do it.

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:28.250
And if you're a
manager, you're used

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:31.530
to being able to tell the people
under you, please do this.

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:32.550
And they'll do it.

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:35.370
But kids don't work that way.

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:36.710
Kids have a mind of their own.

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:39.880
They have little two-year-old
minds and three-year-old mines

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.440
and ten-year-old minds.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:44.200
So I think it's
important to realize

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:48.100
that we have to have
realistic expectations.

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:50.310
A child who doesn't want
to get ready in the morning

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:53.050
to go to school
doesn't know that you

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:54.530
have a meeting at 9:00.

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:57.170
And you know they don't
really care, right?

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:59.140
It's not part of their world.

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:02.520
And so they know that they
like hanging out and playing

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.570
with one more LEGO game.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:09.070
So think about what's
realistic for your child,

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:13.490
and especially the
type of child you have.

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.500
What would your child tell you?

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.820
If your child could express
how yelling effects her,

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.160
what do you think she would say?

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.540
At a home visit I made in
a professional capacity,

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:29.130
I asked a seven-year-old
boy, if you had a magic wand

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:31.570
and you could make a
wish to change something

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:34.780
about your father,
what would it be?

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.715
He replied without
hesitation, I wish

00:15:37.715 --> 00:15:41.870
that he didn't yell
anymore, at me or my mom.

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:46.370
His father's stern face softened
and as he listened to his son.

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:48.360
And he held back tears.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.330
He made a commitment,
then and there,

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:53.000
to do more about
managing his anger

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.970
and working on his marriage.

00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:00.200
A lot of my book is about
no shaming, no blaming.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.900
When you begin to observe
things about yourself--

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.560
and many of you probably
know about mindfulness,

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:09.800
and some of you might practice
meditation or mindfulness--

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:13.020
but the key is that when you
begin to observe yourself,

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:15.930
you have to be kind to yourself.

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:17.940
If you're going to
notice what you do

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:20.550
and then give yourself a
really hard time-- what

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:24.520
a lousy parent, I never
do it right-- then

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.550
you're going to stop looking.

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:29.016
So being a good
enough parent means

00:16:29.016 --> 00:16:30.390
that you're not
perfect-- there's

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:32.560
no such thing as
a perfect parent--

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.110
and that you're
willing, that you

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:37.820
are willing to see what's true.

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:38.970
Not an easy thing.

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:43.430
So in my book, I use the
cognitive behavioral approach.

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:48.030
And that has to do with
noticing your thoughts,

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:49.580
noticing your feelings.

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.000
What am I feeling right now?

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.500
What am I thinking?

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:56.860
And then be being able to
shift that into something else.

00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:01.220
And I'll go into more detail
about that in a minute.

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.680
So the key is triggers.

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.560
We talked a little bit
about what triggers you.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.589
Your kid's not listening.

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:11.010
Your kid's being maybe fighting.

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:13.050
Anyone here have
more than one child?

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:14.790
Maybe some of you listening?

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:15.460
Yeah.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:17.246
Does fighting ever
happen in your house,

00:17:17.246 --> 00:17:19.079
where the kids are
fighting with each other?

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:21.365
Yeah, it's a real trigger
for a lot of people.

00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:26.660
External triggers
are things that

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:34.290
happen-- kids fighting, leaving
their toys around, whining.

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:35.010
That's a big one.

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:38.390
A lot of parents hate
it when kids whine.

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:41.090
Tantrums, those are
external triggers.

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:44.870
But chances are you're not
going to yell unless you also

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:47.860
have escalating thoughts.

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:51.500
So for example, my husband
leaves his underwear

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.030
on the floor or the
towel on the floor.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:58.800
And so the external trigger
is the towel on the floor.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.310
The internal trigger-- and
my husband doesn't do this,

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:02.930
he's fabulous.

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:05.720
This is a hypothetical.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:09.280
The internal
trigger is, why do I

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.750
have to be the maid around here?

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:12.020
Why do I have to clean up?

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:13.910
Why can't he put
his things away?

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:15.620
I don't understand.

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:18.800
So there's an escalation.

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.840
I need some water.

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.400
Thinking about
towels on the floor

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:26.910
must have gotten me-- so
there's an escalation that

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:29.830
happens in your brain.

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:32.850
And the thoughts, the
negative thoughts,

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:35.770
stimulate more of
that adrenaline,

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:37.860
more of that cortisol.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:41.660
And that's when you're
more likely to blow.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:44.030
And cortisol and
adrenaline, you know

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:49.140
a lot about the fight
and flight and freeze.

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.860
It's useful in situations
where we really

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.940
have to fight or flight.

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:57.660
But in my relationships, I've
learned fighting and flighting

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.890
is not the best way to go.

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:02.170
It just really isn't
the best way to go.

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:04.790
So I feel frustrated.

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:07.390
I have these
escalating thoughts.

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:10.790
There's nothing wrong
with my feelings.

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:13.900
They teach me, they
inform me that I've

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:15.640
got to talk to my
husband again about not

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.870
leaving his stuff all around.

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:18.900
Anger it's OK.

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:19.950
It's normal.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:21.590
It's just another emotion.

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:23.370
It's what we do with it.

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:26.480
So now I have these
thoughts, oh, I

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:31.400
can replace them with
something more neutral.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.550
God, he's so good
at so many things.

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:36.460
Maybe I could just
let this one go.

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:39.580
Or I know he was really
in a rush this morning,

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:44.130
or oh gosh, he's just like his
father was, whatever it is,

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:48.280
but something that kind
of brings you down.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.210
And that's the
beginning of being

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:55.300
able to be responsive
rather than reactive.

00:19:55.300 --> 00:20:00.000
And it really, really
does work to have

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.620
awareness of what
you're feeling.

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:05.750
And it took me years
to figure this out.

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:08.650
Because we're like this--
we're going really fast, right?

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:11.530
So to become aware of what
you're feeling, what you're

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:15.430
thinking, and see if you
can shift it a little bit.

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:17.260
And I'll talk more about that.

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:20.480
And in the book, there are
a lot of common triggers

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.200
that people can
identify with and begin

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.980
their process of
understanding their own.

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:28.910
And in the book "Full
Catastrophe Living"

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:32.790
by Jon Kabat-Zinn, he
defines mindfulness

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:36.070
as moment to moment
awareness cultivated

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:39.380
by purposefully paying attention
to things we ordinarily

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:42.680
never give a
moment's thought to.

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:46.180
So breathing is an
example of something

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:49.270
that we normally don't
pay attention to.

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:52.480
And you can be
mindful at any time.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.580
You could be driving
in the car and noticing

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:58.330
your hands clenched
on the steering wheel.

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:01.300
Next time you're
driving in traffic,

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.080
take a couple of breaths.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:06.510
Become aware of how you're
feeling, what you're thinking.

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:08.780
See if you can relax your body.

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:11.140
It's a way to be
in the presence.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:15.860
So much of our life is spent
in the past or in the future.

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:20.380
Your work kind of pulls
you to the future.

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:23.010
You're often evaluating
what's going on in the past.

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:27.130
So we actually have to make
a very conscious effort

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:30.520
to be in the present moment.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.200
What do your children see?

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.820
Whether or not you're
aware of yourself,

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:38.030
your children are
constantly observing you.

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:40.180
They're watching
you go like this

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:43.490
are cursing when
you get cut off.

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:46.160
Jon, a psychologist
and a great dad,

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.620
told me the story of how
his nine-year-old daughter

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:53.770
Carrie gave him feedback
about the morning monster.

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:57.540
One day at breakfast, Carrie
walked into the kitchen

00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:02.240
making a mean face and jumping
around with a wide stance,

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.190
making ape-like
a monster sounds.

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:07.800
Jon laughed and asked
her what she was doing,

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.240
and what kind of animal was she.

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:14.010
She replied, I'm being
the daddy monster.

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:17.550
This is what you look
like in the morning.

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:21.610
Chagrined, Jon asked her why
she thought he looked like this.

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:24.800
And she simply
said, because you're

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.430
angry all the time
in the morning.

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:29.950
Jon thanked her for letting
him know-- after all,

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:31.650
he was a psychologist.

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:34.770
And he sheepishly walked
off and looked in the mirror

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:36.990
to see if the monster
was still there.

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:38.960
And it was.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.100
Jon realized he
was rushing around

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.380
in the morning with a
million things on his mind.

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:47.470
And although he
wasn't always angry,

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:50.400
he was preoccupied
and frequently

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.380
irritated by how long
things were taking

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:56.650
and how much there was to do.

00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:59.050
His daughter's feedback
increased his desire

00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:02.610
to observe himself and
be more present with what

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:06.710
was going on in the moment
rather than just worrying

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:08.470
about the future.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:13.210
Your children are perceptive and
sensitive, and you can be too.

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:15.610
Now it's your turn
to see yourself.

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:18.660
And when you get a glimpse
of your angry monster,

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:23.120
see if you can become friends
and get to know each other.

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:26.340
And again, I know--
I have grandchildren,

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.830
and I know how busy life can be.

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:34.800
Everyone's sitting here and
everyone listening remotely,

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.880
you probably work long hours.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:40.010
And if you have
kids, you're busy.

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:43.830
And it feels like you can't
be present in the moment.

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:49.020
But you can be, because in fact,
sometimes it takes less time.

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:52.850
Just that extra hug
or that extra, sure,

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:55.170
I'll read to you, but
just for five minutes,

00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:59.780
can save you time because a
meltdown might happen otherwise

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:01.980
that might take a lot longer.

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:05.550
And I tell parents a lot, I
do temperament consultations

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:09.350
with parents, and I
tell them that it's

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:11.130
really important to think about.

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:14.860
Even though you're tired,
getting up 10 minutes earlier

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:19.740
to have your coffee, take your
shower before your kids are up,

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:22.780
that alone might be able
to help you in the morning

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:26.910
feel less of that
monster feeling.

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:28.660
And for everyone it's different.

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:33.940
And I think the real focus in my
book is that you're the expert.

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:37.730
You're the expert on your
child, on yourself, not me.

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:40.940
And part of being the expert
is to become more aware

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:42.340
of yourself.

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:44.140
And the temperament
part in my book--

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:46.100
there's a whole chapter
on temperament--

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:50.860
helps you identify your
traits and your child's traits

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:55.670
and see where there's a good fit
and maybe not such a great fit.

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:58.700
I had one child who's fabulous.

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.270
He's doing great
things in the world.

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:05.370
And I adore him, and he
was an intense person.

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:09.780
And so am I. And so we both get
very passionate about things.

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:14.380
But when he was a young child,
he and I would escalate.

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:15.930
He'd do something,
I'd do something.

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:17.900
And it gets up there.

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:21.410
And I really had to
learn, I had to learn

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:23.620
how to manage my own intensity.

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:26.090
I remember one time
he did something--

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:28.700
I think I won't say what it is,
because he'll probably watch

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:33.130
this-- so he did something
that made me really mad.

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:35.930
And I thought, I just can't
go there and scream at him.

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:37.520
I've got to calm down.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:41.870
And I said, you go to your
room until I cool off.

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:44.140
And I realized that's
what I needed to do.

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:48.080
I needed to cool off
before I responded to him.

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:51.490
And then I was able to
give him the discipline

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:54.290
that I thought was appropriate.

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:57.140
One time he was also
yelling about something.

00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:01.500
So I went to his back door, and
I started yelling, ignore him,

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:03.250
folks out there listening.

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:04.610
He's just having a tantrum.

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:07.220
And he said, mom, you're
being so embarrassing.

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:08.250
Stop.

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:11.230
I said, I'm not going
to call CPS, whatever.

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:15.220
And I started laughing
and he started laughing.

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:17.140
And I said, OK, if
you stop, I'll stop.

00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:19.120
You've got to use sense
of humor with kids

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.130
too, especially
when they're older.

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:22.840
So the temperament
chapter is really

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:28.190
important in understanding your
style and your child's style.

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:30.630
There's a yelling
tracker in my book.

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:32.980
And the yelling tracker
is the key tool.

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:37.220
You know like when you want
to figure out your finances,

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:40.070
you have a tracker to
track your spending.

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:43.420
If you're going to Weight
Watchers to lose weight,

00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:45.520
they give you a
tracker so that you

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:48.110
could know, what
is it I'm doing?

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:50.930
And so my yelling
tracker basically

00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:54.080
tells you for
maybe a week or two

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:57.720
when you've yelled, go
back and say, when was it?

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:58.790
What time of day?

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:01.210
Maybe it's always at 4 o'clock.

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:03.690
If you're home at 4:00,
you might melt down.

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:05.770
Or it's always in the morning.

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:09.520
Notice what you did and
what your child did.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:13.750
And then notice how you
felt about what happened.

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:15.920
And think about, what could
I have done differently?

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.090
So the tracker is one
of those key pieces

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:22.270
in the book that really helps.

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:26.880
The ABCDEs of not yelling, let
me just very briefly tell you

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:32.720
what that is, and again
go into much more detail.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:37.830
So A is, ask yourself what
I'm thinking and feeling,

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:39.780
just like I mentioned.

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.940
B, breathe.

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:48.880
When in doubt, take a
couple of belly breaths.

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:49.690
It's amazing.

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:52.970
I think the research shows that
it takes about six seconds--

00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:56.420
there's an organization
called sixseconds.org--

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:59.360
and I learned from them that
it takes about six seconds

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:04.650
to start lowering your
cortisol and coming back

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:06.230
to your grounding.

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:09.580
So if there's no emergency,
if your child's not

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:12.470
about to run into the street--
because then you want to yell,

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:12.970
right?

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:14.636
If they're going to
run into the street,

00:28:14.636 --> 00:28:15.680
yell as loud as you can.

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.270
But if there's no
emergency, you don't

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:21.800
have to discipline right then.

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.670
Take time to breathe.

00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:25.660
Ask yourself, what am I feeling?

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:27.360
What am I thinking?

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.510
C is calm yourself.

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:32.310
So through your breath
you'll calm down.

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:34.380
You might need to get
a glass of water--

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.080
if it's the evening,
maybe a glass of wine.

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:40.250
Your coffee, spray
some rosemary spray,

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:41.880
whatever helps you feel good.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:43.890
Go to the bathroom,
I don't know.

00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:45.910
So calm yourself is C.

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:50.520
And then D is,
decide what's needed.

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:51.830
OK, I'm calm now.

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:53.450
Because when you're
angry and you're

00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:56.560
in your primitive
brain-- Dan Siegel

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:58.880
talks a lot about the brain.

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.250
He's a psychiatrist in LA.

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:02.230
And he talks about
the higher level

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:04.030
brain and then the
primitive brain.

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:06.040
And when you're angry,
you wind up right

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.340
in that primitive brain.

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:08.200
And you know what?

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.500
You're not thinking
at your best.

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:12.060
My husband used
to say, you know,

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:13.824
it feels kind of
good being angry.

00:29:13.824 --> 00:29:15.240
You get all this
energy, you know?

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.840
It's not so bad.

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:19.570
But in fact, you're not
making the best decisions

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:22.280
unless you have to
fight or flight.

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:24.790
So decide.

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:27.840
Calm down and decide
what's needed.

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:30.070
Your kids are fighting.

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:32.670
Maybe all that's needed
is you need to say, OK

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:35.670
guys, separation, five minutes.

00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:37.310
Go play by yourselves.

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:39.460
Or one of you come
make dinner with me,

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:41.340
the other one go set the table.

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:44.770
Or are you wait a minute to
see if they can work it out.

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:46.910
Every family's
different in terms

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:49.420
of what you think is
the right thing to do.

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:51.810
Decide, does my
child need a hug,

00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:55.070
or do they need to
limit being set?

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:59.160
But when you're clear, you'll
be able to decide that better.

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:05.770
And then the last part
is E, ABCDE, empathize.

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:07.800
Oh, right.

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:10.680
She just came back from
her dad's house last night.

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.780
It's always rough the
day she comes back

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:15.350
and we have to make
that transition

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:17.710
to mom's house and dad's house.

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:18.350
Right.

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:20.400
There's always some acting out.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.340
I need to spend a little
more time with her today.

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:28.580
Or empathize with a child who
just isn't feeling so good,

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:32.580
or with your child on
what ever level you can.

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:36.030
Take a minute to see
what are they feeling.

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:38.090
And also have some
compassion for yourself.

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:40.060
Boy, I'm in a grouchy mood.

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:42.020
I didn't get much
sleep last night.

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:44.540
No wonder I'm acting this way.

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:50.520
So the a ABCDE is a
quick way to help you.

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.690
It's like one woman
who read my book said.

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:54.990
She said, Rona, I feel like
I have you on my shoulder

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:59.380
going ABCDE, ABCDE, and I
have to just go, all right.

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:02.650
Ask myself, breathe, calm
down, decide, empathize.

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:04.460
So it's a tool for you.

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:08.900
In the book, I also have
the four C's of discipline.

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:11.830
Now, discipline is
such a huge subject.

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:16.240
And I address it in the book
with an umbrella of the four

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.630
C's.

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:22.020
And I don't give every possible
discipline tip you could want,

00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:25.130
because again, you have
to know your child.

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:26.810
You have to know your style.

00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:30.070
And hopefully if you have
a partner or a spouse,

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:32.330
the two of you are
talking about how

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:34.350
actually to agree
on the discipline.

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:36.300
That takes a lot
of effort, yeah?

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:37.320
Yeah.

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:42.130
So the four C's
are communication.

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:43.920
You're not going to
say to a teenager,

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.780
now, don't come home late.

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:49.580
You're going to say,
be home by 12:00.

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:52.570
You have to be specific
in your communication.

00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:55.090
Now come on Jane, be good.

00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:56.510
What does that mean?

00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:59.240
You have to be specific
in your communication.

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:02.900
Choices are another C.
Too many choices are not

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:04.510
so good for kids.

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:08.640
But once in awhile, they
really need some sense

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:11.600
that they have a little
bit of say in their life.

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:15.220
So my grandson, I
was with him and he

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:17.470
needed to take a
shower the other day.

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:19.850
And I said, Maceo,
you need a shower.

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:22.972
Do you want to take it
now or in 15 minutes?

00:32:22.972 --> 00:32:24.930
And he said, I don't want
to take a shower now.

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:26.820
I said OK, I'll set my timer.

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:28.950
Timers are a great
tool for parents,

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:32.210
and I have a whole section
on timers in my books.

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:34.980
I set the timer on my
phone for 15 minutes.

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:38.890
He heard it go off, and he
happily went into the bathroom.

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:42.010
Because somehow it's like
neutral, it's not like someone

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:43.080
bossing me around.

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.050
It's just the timer.

00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:49.530
But that choice helped him
prepare himself for something

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:52.560
that he really
didn't want to do.

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.850
Some children really need
to have their choice of what

00:32:54.850 --> 00:32:59.290
to wear in the morning, even
though it's not matching.

00:32:59.290 --> 00:33:01.930
It doesn't match,
but maybe I could

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:08.110
let them go up to the wonderful
child care that Janice does.

00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:11.170
The third C is consequences.

00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:14.640
I have a whole section
on family meetings.

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:18.500
Because as a family, you
need to spend time thinking

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.540
about what the rules are.

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:25.750
Here at work, if you're here
on your job, you get a sense--

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:28.110
and I'm sure it's
always changing--

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:30.540
but a sense of what
they are the rules.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:33.170
What am I allowed to do,
what am I not allowed to do?

00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:36.810
And maybe there's
a lot of leeway.

00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:39.710
But the family rules
are really important.

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:43.640
And then you can talk
about the consequences.

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:47.850
And if you have some rules
on the refrigerator even,

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:50.500
it's easier to remember
what you said the rule was.

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.390
Because I used to have
trouble remembering,

00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:53.870
what did I say here?

00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:56.990
So you want to think
about the consequences.

00:33:56.990 --> 00:34:01.230
And I don't believe in
harsh, punitive discipline.

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:03.120
I've just worked
with enough parents.

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:06.370
I used to teach classes in
Richmond, California in Oakland

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:08.850
and all over the Bay Area.

00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:14.690
And it's become so clear to me
that harsh punishment doesn't

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:19.310
really teach kids to be the
adult you want them to be,

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:22.500
because they've got to
learn to solve problems.

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:24.989
It really is about play
and problem solving.

00:34:24.989 --> 00:34:27.290
But there are times
they need consequences.

00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:30.800
And the book talks
a lot about that.

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:36.520
I think a consequence might
be that your child forgets

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:39.190
her lunch box for a
few times in a row,

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:42.210
and you don't rescue
her and rush off

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:44.440
to bring her her
lunch the next time.

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:47.520
And then she remembers, I
need to get my lunch box.

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:52.429
There's a lot of ways to
think about consequences.

00:34:52.429 --> 00:34:56.080
The last one of the
four C's is connection.

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:58.950
Even if you work
full time, there

00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:02.720
are ways to make sure you
connect with your kids.

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:05.030
And if you have
more than one child,

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:09.820
I strongly recommend you have
special time with each child.

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:11.400
And parents will
say, well, but it's

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:12.930
the family time on the weekend.

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:14.590
We all need to be together.

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:18.610
But the truth is that
kids-- I believe-- they also

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:20.960
need time one-on-one
with the parent.

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:23.260
Because when you're
one-on-one with a child,

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:24.650
you're less frustrated.

00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:28.880
And you get to rediscover
what's wonderful about them.

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:34.420
I'm going to be sure and
save time for questions.

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:37.690
So let me just read
a little bit more.

00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:42.130
Use humor, creativity.

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:43.440
Pick your battles.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.880
You've all heard this.

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:47.250
But really think about
what's important.

00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:50.570
What do I want to have
a consequence for?

00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:53.740
And there are things
maybe I could just let go.

00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:56.710
In my book there's a section
on special circumstances.

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:59.880
If you're divorced, single
parent, foster parent,

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:05.860
if you have a child with a
disability or a disorder,

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:09.190
there are children with
Attention Deficit Disorder.

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:11.680
I used to work a lot with
parents whose children were

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:13.710
diagnosed with
that, big subject.

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:14.820
We won't get into it here.

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:18.940
But sometimes a
child who's impulsive

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:21.230
will really trigger you more.

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:24.300
And you could have a
child with a disability

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:27.920
and you're working so hard
to be an advocate for them.

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:31.270
And you're fuel tank goes low.

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:33.560
So there's a lot
on that as well.

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:42.170
I think I'll end this
part because we'll

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:48.240
get to your questions with
a thought to consider.

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:50.550
If only we could
protect our children

00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:55.830
and ourselves from all suffering
and pain, that'd be so nice.

00:36:55.830 --> 00:37:00.600
We can't, but we can do our best
to manage stressful situations

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.030
that throw us off balance.

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:05.550
Yelling doesn't make
anything better.

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:08.920
It only takes you further away.

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.580
We all make mistakes
as parents and miss

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:15.040
clues pointing to the
way towards healing.

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:17.510
When your kids are
grown, you'll look back

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:20.880
and realize the things you
could have done differently.

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:24.560
If only you had been more aware,
knowledgeable, courageous or

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:26.010
kind.

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:28.350
Forgive yourself for
mistakes you've made

00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:31.950
and do what you can now to
make a difficult situation

00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:33.960
a little bit easier.

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:37.020
Spend a few minutes each day
thinking about the things

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:39.180
you're grateful for.

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:43.670
This will help you restore
your balance during hard times.

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:46.220
And the book ends
with the words,

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:48.690
"World peace begins at home."

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:51.610
Because I've been thinking
a lot about how frustrated

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:54.530
I feel sometimes,
that I don't know

00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:59.500
what I can do to make this
a more peaceful world.

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:01.890
I'm sure many of you have
that feeling too when

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:06.270
you listen to the news
or Google something.

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:15.460
And I realized that if we all
do what we can in our homes,

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:17.720
it actually matters.

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:21.360
When we do our best to treat our
children, others, and ourselves

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:24.950
with kindness and respect,
even with our imperfections,

00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:26.820
there's a ripple effect.

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:29.280
A shift takes
place in ourselves,

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:33.090
in our children, and the people
we interact with every day.

00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:37.030
When we heal our wounds
with courage and honesty,

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:39.600
we can use our energy
for our benefit

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:41.730
and the benefit of others.

00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:46.450
One person like you or me
can have a significant impact

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:48.300
on the violence,
greed, suffering

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:51.800
and lack of compassion
around us all.

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:55.990
If more parents model respectful
communication and empathy--

00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:58.540
because your children are
learning from you-- then

00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:00.990
the next generation will
have a better chance

00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:04.040
to create a more peaceful world.

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:06.400
Consider these
questions every day.

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:10.190
What will I discover today
that brings meaning to my life?

00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:12.160
What will I learn
from my children,

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:14.550
and what will they
learn from me?

00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:20.400
And how can I offer love,
comfort, or peace to someone?

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:24.120
And I end with those
words because I even

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:28.820
see it with my adult children,
my oldest son just turned 44.

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:33.900
And I realize it's an
ongoing, lifelong process

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:36.650
of learning how to be
the person you want to be

00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:39.930
and raising a child
to be the adult you'd

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:42.400
like to see the world
have in the world.

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:45.800
And that's where I feel
so grateful that I've

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:46.770
learned a lot.

00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:50.550
And this book, I think,
shares both the mistakes

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:53.480
I've made-- some
of, them just a few.

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:56.250
There are a lot more,
just a few in the book.

00:39:56.250 --> 00:39:59.520
But also the things that
I've learned to change.

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:02.540
So I'm going to stop talking
right there for a minute

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:04.810
so I can take your questions.

00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:07.970
AUDIENCE: My question is
about how much of what

00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:11.490
you've been talking about
and the topic of your book

00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:16.440
would you say applies equally
well to grown up children,

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:19.507
if you would, adults?

00:40:19.507 --> 00:40:21.840
RONA RENNER: Yes, it's a good
question, how much of this

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:25.260
applies to adult
relationships, right?

00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:26.960
And I have these
two dear friends.

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.770
And they bought
the book because it

00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:32.080
was their friend who wrote
it, but they don't have kids.

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:33.700
And they've been
reading it together.

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:36.600
And they say that it's
really helped them

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.290
in their arguments
and their fights.

00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:40.540
Because the truth
is, I'm talking

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:45.750
about how do you respond
rather than react?

00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:49.940
And when a partner
does something suddenly

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:53.962
and you're angry or
frustrated, there you are.

00:40:53.962 --> 00:40:56.470
You have a lot of
choice right then.

00:40:56.470 --> 00:41:01.330
You either go right with it
and you get into that argument,

00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:03.700
or what I learned to
do with my husband--

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:05.130
I have a great
husband, and we've

00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:08.420
worked hard on this--
is to say, wow.

00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:11.930
I'm feeling kind of
frustrated here or mad.

00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:14.200
I need to cool off first.

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:16.500
And when I do that,
it's really important

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:19.110
to say, and let's
talk in five minutes.

00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:23.200
Because if you just leave--
unless it's dangerous,

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:26.430
of course you leave-- you raise
up a lot of abandonment issues

00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:27.680
as well.

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:30.120
But in the workplace
too, someone-- and I

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:32.100
was talking with
someone earlier,

00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:35.600
and he was asking about, can
this be used in the workplace?

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:37.680
Absolutely.

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:40.590
When I work with parents,
I often say to them,

00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:45.830
think of a boss you've had
who was a really good boss.

00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:48.760
What were some of
those qualities?

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:50.900
I had a great boss when
I worked at Kaiser.

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:52.570
He had a sense of humor.

00:41:52.570 --> 00:41:53.600
He was encouraging.

00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:55.800
He gave me a lot of
autonomy, but gave

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:57.850
me feedback if things
didn't go well.

00:41:57.850 --> 00:41:59.760
And I thought of
all those qualities.

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:03.390
And those were qualities
that I wanted as a parent,

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:07.470
because children look
to you as their boss.

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:10.910
So I think it's
very transferable

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:14.420
in your relationships with
coworkers and partners.

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:18.390
Also the temperament
part, some of the issues

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:22.160
that couples have are not
because one person is right

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:23.780
and one person is wrong.

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:26.950
It's really about their
difference in temperament.

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:29.680
You might have a very
low energy level,

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:34.580
so you want to stay
home and watch baseball

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:37.220
or just kind of read a book.

00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:39.190
And your partner might
have a lot of energy,

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:41.740
and they want to go,
go, go and do, do, do.

00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:44.080
And it's not like one of
you is wrong or right,

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:46.380
but it's that temperamental fit.

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:49.070
So I think even though
the focus of the book

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:54.110
is on yelling and yelling
for parents and children,

00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:58.370
what I write about is so
applicable, because that ABCDE

00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:00.310
can work with anyone.

00:43:00.310 --> 00:43:02.690
And is that answering
your question?

00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:03.380
Yeah.

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:05.000
And I really
appreciate those of you

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.630
who came today who
aren't parents.

00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:12.560
Because you were
kids at one point,

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:15.950
and you know what it's like
being raised by parents.

00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:19.230
So you may someday be a parent
or an uncle or an auntie.

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:22.550
And knowing this information
can be very valuable.

00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:23.559
Yeah, go ahead.

00:43:23.559 --> 00:43:25.850
AUDIENCE: My question, you
touched on something earlier

00:43:25.850 --> 00:43:27.340
and it made me laugh
just for the second,

00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:29.756
because that's what we're going
through with my child now,

00:43:29.756 --> 00:43:31.820
is that constant whining.

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:32.800
RONA RENNER: Whining.

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:35.449
AUDIENCE: And I'm curious
if your book addresses

00:43:35.449 --> 00:43:36.990
ways to combat that,
because it seems

00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:39.156
like sometimes the only way
we can get her attention

00:43:39.156 --> 00:43:43.390
to stop whining is if we raise
our voice to just stop them.

00:43:43.390 --> 00:43:47.370
Otherwise, it's a constant loop
of just high-pitched whining

00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:49.872
or screaming or crying, or
whatever the moment warrants.

00:43:49.872 --> 00:43:50.580
RONA RENNER: Yes.

00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:51.417
And how old is she?

00:43:51.417 --> 00:43:52.333
AUDIENCE: She's three.

00:43:52.333 --> 00:43:53.958
RONA RENNER:
Three-year-old who whines.

00:43:53.958 --> 00:43:56.270
The three-year-old
is really trying

00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:58.860
to figure out their power.

00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:03.630
How much power they have, and
can they get what they want.

00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:06.910
And I think with whining,
it's similar to a lot

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:08.590
of other things.

00:44:08.590 --> 00:44:12.080
If what you're doing isn't
working in parenting,

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:15.460
stop doing what you're
doing and think,

00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:17.160
how else can I approach this?

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:18.930
I'm a smart person here.

00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:20.040
What can I do differently?

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:24.370
Well, for some people,
they just won't respond.

00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:26.820
They just zip it when
the kid is whining.

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:28.870
And they can tell them, look.

00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:32.300
When you speak to me like
that, I'm not going to respond.

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:34.230
I need you to take
it over again.

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:36.430
You've probably
tried that, right?

00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:39.860
And will she take it over again?

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:42.072
Right, and I'll
repeat what she said.

00:44:42.072 --> 00:44:43.030
She just keeps whining.

00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:44.510
It might stop for a second.

00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:47.780
I've done it where, with the
little older children I've had,

00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:51.400
someone used a tape recorder
and let them listen and ,

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:53.280
take your phone out,
and let them listen.

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:54.700
This is what
whining sounds like.

00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:56.158
Because you may
not understand what

00:44:56.158 --> 00:45:00.080
I'm talking about, especially
because she's probably intense.

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:04.264
And so she has that kind
of passion and intensity.

00:45:04.264 --> 00:45:05.430
This is what it sounds like.

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:06.980
Now, I'd like you to practice.

00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:08.460
Let's practice.

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.030
And when she's
not in a bad mood,

00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:13.320
I want you to
practice how to ask

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:15.420
me the same thing
without whining.

00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:18.260
And then of course, you give
the positive feedback to that.

00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:22.070
But parents will
often react because

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:24.020
of their own frustration.

00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:29.620
It's as though the whining
is getting under their skin.

00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:33.480
And so you have to work
on that ABCDE breathing.

00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:37.135
And if it's in public, you need
to take her into the bathroom

00:45:37.135 --> 00:45:38.760
or take her-- it's
just like a tantrum.

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:41.090
AUDIENCE: It's more
like when I'm driving.

00:45:41.090 --> 00:45:42.470
RONA RENNER: When
you're driving.

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:46.650
Oh, don't they know how to get
to you when you're driving?

00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:52.450
And I found that if I wasn't on
the freeway, I would pull over.

00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:54.784
And I know you're often in
a rush to get somewhere,

00:45:54.784 --> 00:45:56.200
but I'd pull over
and say, I can't

00:45:56.200 --> 00:46:00.120
drive when you whine
because it's dangerous.

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:02.282
I'm afraid I'll get
into an accident

00:46:02.282 --> 00:46:04.240
because you're whining
and really bothering me.

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:07.160
Or wear a headset
and just ignore it.

00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:08.410
That's the other thing to try.

00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:10.140
So the idea here is, again.

00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:12.950
Without knowing, I'd want
to know her temperament

00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:14.680
and help you that way.

00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:16.930
Just try different things.

00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:22.050
But don't let her strong
reaction then make you react.

00:46:22.050 --> 00:46:23.760
And that's with the yelling is.

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:25.940
You just want it to stop.

00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:29.390
And what you're teaching
her, in a way, when you're

00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:33.090
yelling is saying, if we
have strong reactions,

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:34.900
we get what we want.

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:36.960
And whining will pass.

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:38.480
It will definitely pass.

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:40.689
But it's a great
question, thank you.

00:46:40.689 --> 00:46:41.230
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:42.780
Thank you so much for coming.

00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:45.900
I just wanted to share that
my daughter, she's three,

00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:49.730
and she is a
leader, as they say.

00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:52.550
She loves being very
active and leading kids.

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:55.100
And she learned that
if she yells at school,

00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:57.540
the kids listen and
it's very effective.

00:46:57.540 --> 00:46:59.710
So we've been working with
her trying not to yell.

00:46:59.710 --> 00:47:00.830
She doesn't do it at home.

00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:02.260
It doesn't work on us.

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:03.820
But she does it a school.

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:07.535
And what I wanted to highlight
is within the framework

00:47:07.535 --> 00:47:10.300
that you're describing is
that the teachers at school

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:11.920
came up with this
brilliant idea.

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:15.850
They made a little book--
it's like five pages, pictures

00:47:15.850 --> 00:47:17.740
like a little character picture.

00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:21.710
And it says, you can
take a breath and.

00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:23.730
You can talk to a teacher.

00:47:23.730 --> 00:47:25.430
You can move away.

00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:26.430
You can read a book.

00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:28.612
And it basically gives
you five choices.

00:47:28.612 --> 00:47:30.320
So when they catch
her in the moment when

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:33.700
she's about to start yelling,
they give her this little book

00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:34.580
and say, choose.

00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:35.100
What would you like to do?

00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:36.240
RONA RENNER: Fabulous.

00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:39.440
AUDIENCE: And so she does,
and then she doesn't yell.

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:41.350
But the beauty is that
you need to catch her

00:47:41.350 --> 00:47:43.650
before she yells, because
once she starts yelling,

00:47:43.650 --> 00:47:45.233
she's already in
that stage, and she--

00:47:45.233 --> 00:47:47.840
RONA RENNER: Right, and the
teacher in this situation

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:51.460
is saying, yelling is
an automatic habit.

00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:53.280
And just like for
some of you parents,

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:55.320
yelling is an automatic habit.

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:59.300
And so there are other choices.

00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:02.950
And if you can catch it
before your adrenaline kicks

00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:06.340
in, same thing with her, but
I love that the teacher has

00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:09.650
really developed a book saying
here are some other choices,

00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:10.275
it's brilliant.

00:48:10.275 --> 00:48:11.941
AUDIENCE: I thought
it was so beautiful.

00:48:11.941 --> 00:48:13.670
I took pictures and
I thought, I wish

00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:16.170
I had it with me too
sometimes, like if there's

00:48:16.170 --> 00:48:18.812
a situation when you get
upset, whip out the book.

00:48:18.812 --> 00:48:21.020
RONA RENNER: Well, if you
ever want to send it to me,

00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:22.445
I'll post it on my website.

00:48:22.445 --> 00:48:25.510
Oh by the way,
nurserona.com is my website.

00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:26.570
I should say that.

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:28.560
And I'm also on Google Helpouts.

00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:32.030
OK, let's see-- and
NurseRonaRN Facebook.

00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:34.440
OK, what specific
strategies can you

00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:38.290
offer to deal with young
siblings hitting each other?

00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:40.650
My wife and I try
so many things.

00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:42.620
We want them to work
things out on their own

00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:44.840
without maiming each other.

00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:46.280
Good goal, right?

00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:48.450
No maiming.

00:48:48.450 --> 00:48:51.920
Hitting is coming up a
lot for me in my practice.

00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:53.960
A lot of parents
have been calling me

00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:56.060
because the kids are hitting.

00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:58.360
And I think it's the
kind of thing you really

00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:01.720
have to have a serious
family meeting about

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:05.630
and really set that rule--
no hitting in our house.

00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:10.090
And a lot of parents,
80% of parents

00:49:10.090 --> 00:49:12.530
still use corporal
punishment I'm told.

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:15.460
But a lot of parents
use yelling instead of

00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:19.680
hitting, because hitting
was seen to not be so good.

00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:22.670
But if you can say no
hitting in our household,

00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:26.200
because you don't use that
yourself, it's a good way

00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:29.020
to have a meeting
and say, hitting

00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:30.800
is not allowed in this house.

00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:32.190
And here's why.

00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:34.460
I don't want to hit you.

00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:36.400
I don't want you
to hit each other.

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:40.580
Those kids, the person who
sent this, thank you very much.

00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:43.490
They also need one-on-one
time with each parent

00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:45.350
so they're getting
some special attention,

00:49:45.350 --> 00:49:48.390
because that reduces
sibling rivalry.

00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:50.230
And then you might
have to have it

00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:53.350
connected to some
privilege they have.

00:49:53.350 --> 00:49:55.000
And I do say that
once in a while,

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.340
you need to do that
to break a habit.

00:49:57.340 --> 00:50:01.490
And it might be that they love
their TV time after dinner.

00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:04.394
And it may be that here's
this very simple chart,

00:50:04.394 --> 00:50:05.560
you didn't hit your brother.

00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:08.980
There was no maiming today.

00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:11.040
You each get your TV time.

00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:14.140
And if hitting happens, you
won't, because in our house

00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:16.830
there's privilege
and responsibility.

00:50:16.830 --> 00:50:19.670
Kids think that the TV
or the iPhone or the pad

00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:21.170
is attached to them.

00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:23.310
They think it's another
organ sometimes,

00:50:23.310 --> 00:50:24.980
especially with older kids.

00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:27.460
And we have to remember
that those are privileges.

00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:30.410
So sometimes you need
a little leverage.

00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:33.790
But I think the first step is to
really have that family meeting

00:50:33.790 --> 00:50:36.920
and say, this is
important to us.

00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:40.350
We really don't want anyone
in our house to get hit.

00:50:40.350 --> 00:50:42.570
I can take another question.

00:50:42.570 --> 00:50:45.840
AUDIENCE: Can you suggest any
simple conversational tactics

00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:49.560
for suggesting your book to
someone who could probably

00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:52.100
use it without seeming
to obviously insult

00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:53.400
their capabilities as a parent?

00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:55.666
Maybe this person is
even married to you,

00:50:55.666 --> 00:50:57.290
or maybe it's a
relative or a stranger.

00:50:57.290 --> 00:50:58.665
RONA RENNER: Right,
just like me.

00:50:58.665 --> 00:50:59.832
I love it, I love it.

00:50:59.832 --> 00:51:01.040
How do you suggest this book?

00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:03.470
And I've had a lot of
people ask me that.

00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:08.650
And in your case, you
just bring it home

00:51:08.650 --> 00:51:11.340
and say, God, I heard this
really good talk at Google

00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:11.950
today.

00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:14.790
And I just thought-- and
then just leave it there.

00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:17.000
But don't say, here honey.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000
This is for you.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.980
Because she's not going to
like it, or he or whoever

00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:23.650
it is, not going
to like it so much.

00:51:23.650 --> 00:51:25.890
So you could say,
I got this book.

00:51:25.890 --> 00:51:27.540
I thought that I
could learn a lot.

00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:30.320
And if you're
interested, we might even

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:33.397
want to look at the
temperament piece together.

00:51:33.397 --> 00:51:35.480
There's a whole chapter
on different temperaments.

00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:39.290
So that's sort of a safe
neutral place to go.

00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:42.790
I've had people ask me
that who are grandparents

00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:45.710
and they want to give the
book to their children who

00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:47.270
are yelling a lot and.

00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:49.910
I think you have to be really
tactful, because no one wants

00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:52.340
to be told they're a bad parent.

00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:55.770
We feel insecure as parents.

00:51:55.770 --> 00:51:59.140
But if you are living with
someone who's yelling a lot,

00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:02.086
you can have that honest
conversation, say you know?

00:52:02.086 --> 00:52:03.950
I know we have different styles.

00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:08.710
You're Italian, I'm not,
whatever you want to say.

00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:10.500
And I know we have
different styles.

00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:12.760
But I thought maybe we
could read this together,

00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:17.750
because the studies are
showing that a lot of yelling

00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:20.100
is detrimental to kids.

00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:23.030
And I know I'm not perfect
and I do things wrong.

00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:28.520
And maybe, maybe you would
yell less if I pitched in more.

00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:31.010
Because that's the other thing
I talk about in the book,

00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:33.050
that sometimes you're
yelling because you

00:52:33.050 --> 00:52:37.150
want your partner to hear that
they need help-- that you need

00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:38.400
help, not that they need help.

00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:41.000
So I'm busy and I'm
yelling at my kids.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.480
But what I really want is my
partner to come in and help.

00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:45.760
So it could open up
a great conversation.

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:47.720
I think it's 12:59.

00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:48.650
We need to stop.

00:52:48.650 --> 00:52:51.380
And I'll stick around if
anyone has more questions.

00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:53.470
And I'd be happy
to sign your books.

00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:55.230
And I just want to
thank you so much,

00:52:55.230 --> 00:52:58.060
and thank Janice Keyser
for being my host.

00:52:58.060 --> 00:53:01.110
[APPLAUSE]
