it used to be the clocks had faces on

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060
it used to be the clocks had faces on
 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.760
it used to be the clocks had faces on
them their analog clocks their unknown

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770
them their analog clocks their unknown
 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.769
them their analog clocks their unknown
today but your occasional you find one

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779
today but your occasional you find one
 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.040
today but your occasional you find one
and you look at it you haven't least I

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050
and you look at it you haven't least I
 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.499
and you look at it you haven't least I
have an immediate question of hey if

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509
have an immediate question of hey if
 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.820
have an immediate question of hey if
it's known how long will it be you know

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830
it's known how long will it be you know
 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.920
it's known how long will it be you know
these are lined up how long will it be

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930
these are lined up how long will it be
 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.439
these are lined up how long will it be
until they're lined up begin

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449
until they're lined up begin
 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.599
until they're lined up begin
well not it's more than an hour but you

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609
well not it's more than an hour but you
 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.150
well not it's more than an hour but you
know how long until you know just at

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160
know how long until you know just at
 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.569
know how long until you know just at
exactly what time will the clock hands

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579
exactly what time will the clock hands
 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.250
exactly what time will the clock hands
line up okay a little bit after 1:00

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260
line up okay a little bit after 1:00
 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.340
line up okay a little bit after 1:00
it'll line up and line up again a little

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350
it'll line up and line up again a little
 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.069
it'll line up and line up again a little
bit after - so what's the time

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079
bit after - so what's the time
 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.690
bit after - so what's the time
difference between there you know how

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700
difference between there you know how
 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.060
difference between there you know how
many you say well it's more than an hour

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070
many you say well it's more than an hour
 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.490
many you say well it's more than an hour
how can I figure that one out I'm

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500
how can I figure that one out I'm
 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.170
how can I figure that one out I'm
sitting there saying yeah you know I

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180
sitting there saying yeah you know I
 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.660
sitting there saying yeah you know I
remember sitting in a fifth-grade

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670
remember sitting in a fifth-grade
 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.369
remember sitting in a fifth-grade
classroom trying to figure it out

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379
classroom trying to figure it out
 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.610
classroom trying to figure it out
drawing diagrams and thinking boy I need

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620
drawing diagrams and thinking boy I need
 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.990
drawing diagrams and thinking boy I need
to add a little bit more a little bit

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000
to add a little bit more a little bit
 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.389
to add a little bit more a little bit
more little just it's going to be a

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399
more little just it's going to be a
 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.000
more little just it's going to be a
little bit more than that scurvy and

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010
little bit more than that scurvy and
 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.370
little bit more than that scurvy and
then you know it's going to be more than

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380
then you know it's going to be more than
 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.960
then you know it's going to be more than
that more than that how much how much

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970
that more than that how much how much
 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:16.010
that more than that how much how much
time in two and then like you I realized

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020
time in two and then like you I realized
 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.340
time in two and then like you I realized
though there's a simple way to solve it

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350
 
 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.749
 
let's go back to noon how many times do

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759
let's go back to noon how many times do
 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.050
let's go back to noon how many times do
these hands cross in 12 hours

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060
these hands cross in 12 hours
 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.289
these hands cross in 12 hours
well there's once twice three times and

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299
well there's once twice three times and
 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.859
well there's once twice three times and
so on in fact think about it you'll

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869
so on in fact think about it you'll
 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.590
so on in fact think about it you'll
realize the hands cross each other

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600
realize the hands cross each other
 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.039
realize the hands cross each other
11 times every 12 hours

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049
11 times every 12 hours
 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:02:00.440
11 times every 12 hours
ah if there's 11 hand crossings every 12

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450
ah if there's 11 hand crossings every 12
 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.899
ah if there's 11 hand crossings every 12
hours that means that they will cross

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909
hours that means that they will cross
 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.370
hours that means that they will cross
each other so that means how long will

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380
each other so that means how long will
 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.780
each other so that means how long will
it take for between here

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790
it take for between here
 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:19.740
it take for between here
to here that must be 12 / 11 hours which

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750
to here that must be 12 / 11 hours which
 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.300
to here that must be 12 / 11 hours which
happens to be 1 hour 5 minutes and 27

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310
happens to be 1 hour 5 minutes and 27
 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:34.289
happens to be 1 hour 5 minutes and 27
something seconds my clock is almost out

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299
something seconds my clock is almost out
 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.930
something seconds my clock is almost out
of potential energy so I might as well

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940
of potential energy so I might as well
 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:44.069
of potential energy so I might as well
wind it up Oh recharge my old test

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079
wind it up Oh recharge my old test
 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:49.229
wind it up Oh recharge my old test

objectivity and in each episode we look
 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.750
objectivity and in each episode we look
at a different science treasure it could

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760
at a different science treasure it could
 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.440
at a different science treasure it could
be things like Isaac Newton's death-mask

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450
be things like Isaac Newton's death-mask
 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.449

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:17.789
to get in fact this week the video is
about clocks and there's a few more

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799
about clocks and there's a few more
 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.710
about clocks and there's a few more
clock videos coming soon as well we've

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720
clock videos coming soon as well we've
 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.420
