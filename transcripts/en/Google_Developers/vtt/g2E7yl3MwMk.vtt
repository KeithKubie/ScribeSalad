Being able to compose widgets together

00:00:09.731 --> 00:00:12.462
is one of Flutter's
most powerful features.

00:00:12.972 --> 00:00:14.856
But how can you specify

00:00:14.867 --> 00:00:19.364
how a child should be laid out
or positioned inside its parent?

00:00:19.723 --> 00:00:22.714
For example, if you have
a <i>Container</i> widget,

00:00:22.714 --> 00:00:27.358
how do you choose where a <i>Text</i> widget
might show up inside it?

00:00:27.358 --> 00:00:31.385
The simplest case is to center it
using the <i>Center</i> widget.

00:00:31.868 --> 00:00:35.501
But what if you want to place it
in the bottom right, for example?

00:00:36.018 --> 00:00:38.936
Here's where the <i>Align</i> widget
comes in handy.

00:00:39.626 --> 00:00:44.562
<i>Align</i> will let you place widgets
in a defined area of its parent widget,

00:00:44.562 --> 00:00:48.477
such as the <i>bottomRight,</i>
or <i>topLeft,</i> or <i>centerRight</i>--

00:00:48.477 --> 00:00:49.900
wherever you fancy.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.166
You can also specify the alignment values

00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:56.755
where -1 to 1 are the ranges

00:00:56.755 --> 00:01:00.840
for both left to right and top to bottom.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.751
This lets you precisely lay out
your child widget within its parent.

00:01:06.074 --> 00:01:10.195
You can also use <i>Align</i>
to position widgets in a stack.

00:01:10.553 --> 00:01:14.761
