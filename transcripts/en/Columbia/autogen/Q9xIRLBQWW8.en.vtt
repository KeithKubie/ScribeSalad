public documents as I could find there
were a couple of reports from the EPA

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:07.050
were a couple of reports from the EPA
 

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.529
were a couple of reports from the EPA
and there were some petroleum

00:08:09.529 --> 00:08:09.539
and there were some petroleum
 

00:08:09.539 --> 00:08:11.480
and there were some petroleum
engineering textbook someone found for

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:11.490
engineering textbook someone found for
 

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:15.020
engineering textbook someone found for
me and just really taking any tiny bit

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:15.030
me and just really taking any tiny bit
 

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:16.909
me and just really taking any tiny bit
of information I could find on the

00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:16.919
of information I could find on the
 

00:08:16.919 --> 00:08:19.010
of information I could find on the
chemistry of dilbit and then i would put

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:19.020
chemistry of dilbit and then i would put
 

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.070
chemistry of dilbit and then i would put
together these notes and give them to

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:21.080
together these notes and give them to
 

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.439
together these notes and give them to
oil spill experts in the US and these

00:08:24.439 --> 00:08:24.449
oil spill experts in the US and these
 

00:08:24.449 --> 00:08:26.689
oil spill experts in the US and these
were people who had never worked with

00:08:26.689 --> 00:08:26.699
were people who had never worked with
 

00:08:26.699 --> 00:08:28.820
were people who had never worked with
dilbit but they had worked on the BP oil

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:28.830
dilbit but they had worked on the BP oil
 

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:31.159
dilbit but they had worked on the BP oil
spill or you know they had worked in

00:08:31.159 --> 00:08:31.169
spill or you know they had worked in
 

00:08:31.169 --> 00:08:33.019
spill or you know they had worked in
other they had worked with noah and the

00:08:33.019 --> 00:08:33.029
other they had worked with noah and the
 

00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:34.969
other they had worked with noah and the
US Fish and Wildlife Service and they

00:08:34.969 --> 00:08:34.979
US Fish and Wildlife Service and they
 

00:08:34.979 --> 00:08:37.670
US Fish and Wildlife Service and they
knew enough chemistry that I would give

00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680
knew enough chemistry that I would give
 

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.350
knew enough chemistry that I would give
them little bits and pieces and they

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:39.360
them little bits and pieces and they
 

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.050
them little bits and pieces and they
could put together the story for me so

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:42.060
could put together the story for me so
 

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:43.909
could put together the story for me so
they were able to tell me that yes you

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919
they were able to tell me that yes you
 

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:45.890
they were able to tell me that yes you
know given the little bit of information

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:45.900
know given the little bit of information
 

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.900
know given the little bit of information
you've given me this is how the oil

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:47.910
you've given me this is how the oil
 

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:50.600
you've given me this is how the oil
would react this is it makes sense that

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:50.610
would react this is it makes sense that
 

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:53.090
would react this is it makes sense that
you know after a few days most of the

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:53.100
you know after a few days most of the
 

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.980
you know after a few days most of the
light chemicals would evaporate which is

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:54.990
light chemicals would evaporate which is
 

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:57.079
light chemicals would evaporate which is
when the heavy oil sinks and that's why

00:08:57.079 --> 00:08:57.089
when the heavy oil sinks and that's why
 

00:08:57.089 --> 00:08:57.890
when the heavy oil sinks and that's why
you have a problem

00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:57.900
you have a problem
 

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:01.490
you have a problem
so that's how I approach the science and

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:01.500
so that's how I approach the science and
 

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.470
so that's how I approach the science and
then the other thing that really helped

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:03.480
then the other thing that really helped
 

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.350
then the other thing that really helped
was inside climate sent me to an I re

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:06.360
was inside climate sent me to an I re
 

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:10.130

boot camp for journalists on Excel and

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:10.140
boot camp for journalists on Excel and
 

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:14.330
boot camp for journalists on Excel and
access and having that skill set was was

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:14.340
access and having that skill set was was
 

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.600
access and having that skill set was was
really helpful we were able to

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:16.610
really helpful we were able to
 

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:19.670
really helpful we were able to
fact-check and pull out interesting

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680
fact-check and pull out interesting
 

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.850
fact-check and pull out interesting
tidbits from the air monitoring that EPA

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:22.860
tidbits from the air monitoring that EPA
 

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.340
tidbits from the air monitoring that EPA
had done after the spill because they

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:25.350
had done after the spill because they
 

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.260
had done after the spill because they
were trying to figure out how much

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:27.270
were trying to figure out how much
 

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.000
were trying to figure out how much
benzene was in the air and was it safe

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.010
benzene was in the air and was it safe
 

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:30.590
benzene was in the air and was it safe
for people to breathe so that helped

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:30.600
for people to breathe so that helped
 

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.650
for people to breathe so that helped
there and also using one of the federal

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:33.660
there and also using one of the federal
 

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:37.490
there and also using one of the federal
databases on pipeline safety I was able

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:37.500
databases on pipeline safety I was able
 

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.260
databases on pipeline safety I was able
to figure out for follow-up story that

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:39.270
to figure out for follow-up story that
 

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:43.010
to figure out for follow-up story that
most of during most of the oil pipeline

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:43.020
most of during most of the oil pipeline
 

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:47.210
most of during most of the oil pipeline
spills in the country the software that

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:47.220
spills in the country the software that
 

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.370
spills in the country the software that
they have for detecting spills is pretty

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:49.380
they have for detecting spills is pretty
 

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.290
they have for detecting spills is pretty
much useless so only five percent of

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:51.300
much useless so only five percent of
 

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:52.730
much useless so only five percent of
those spills were detected by the

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:52.740
those spills were detected by the
 

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.760
those spills were detected by the
company's technology and that was again

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:55.770
company's technology and that was again
 

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:58.250
company's technology and that was again
really helpful the interesting finding

00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:58.260
really helpful the interesting finding
 

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.110
really helpful the interesting finding
in this series was that the federal

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:00.120
in this series was that the federal
 

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.970
in this series was that the federal
regulators didn't even know it was going

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:01.980
regulators didn't even know it was going
 

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:07.180
regulators didn't even know it was going
on at the time it was right the way the

on at the time it was right the way the
 

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:10.490
on at the time it was right the way the
regulations are set up the regulator's

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:10.500
regulations are set up the regulator's
 

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.430

know if a pipeline contains crude oil or

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440
know if a pipeline contains crude oil or
 

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.040
know if a pipeline contains crude oil or
a natural gas or you know compressed co2

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:16.050
a natural gas or you know compressed co2
 

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:17.690
a natural gas or you know compressed co2
or something like that but they don't

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:17.700
or something like that but they don't
 

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.330
or something like that but they don't
know what type of crude oil is in the

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:20.340
know what type of crude oil is in the
 

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:24.770
know what type of crude oil is in the
pipeline and the company didn't tell the

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:24.780
pipeline and the company didn't tell the
 

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:28.550
pipeline and the company didn't tell the
EPA or anyone exactly what type of oil

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560
EPA or anyone exactly what type of oil
 

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.070
EPA or anyone exactly what type of oil
was in the line and people found out

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:31.080
was in the line and people found out
 

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.730
was in the line and people found out
because I think it was a week after the

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:34.740
because I think it was a week after the
 

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:36.920
because I think it was a week after the
spill some scientist walked into the

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:36.930
spill some scientist walked into the
 

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:38.780
spill some scientist walked into the
river and all this oil started bubbling

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:38.790
river and all this oil started bubbling
 

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.000
river and all this oil started bubbling
up from the bottom of the river and

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:41.010
up from the bottom of the river and
 

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:42.020
up from the bottom of the river and
that's when they realized they had a

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:42.030
that's when they realized they had a
 

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.260
that's when they realized they had a
problem and also there were some local

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:45.270
problem and also there were some local
 

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.120
problem and also there were some local

Michigan messenger they questioned the

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:51.030
Michigan messenger they questioned the
 

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.510
Michigan messenger they questioned the
CEO of the company a lot and sort of got

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:53.520
CEO of the company a lot and sort of got
 

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.990
CEO of the company a lot and sort of got
him to admit it was still bit this this

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:57.000
him to admit it was still bit this this
 

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.230
him to admit it was still bit this this
is essentially a narrative of an oil

spill and there are so many moving parts

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:02.670
spill and there are so many moving parts
 

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.520
spill and there are so many moving parts
to it I mean how did you put that

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:04.530
to it I mean how did you put that
 

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:07.100
to it I mean how did you put that
chronology together I mean what what

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:07.110
chronology together I mean what what
 

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:08.540
chronology together I mean what what
were your main sources of information

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:08.550
were your main sources of information
 

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:09.890
were your main sources of information
for example how did you find out

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:09.900
for example how did you find out
 

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:10.410
for example how did you find out
regularly

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:10.420
regularly
 

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.600
regularly
no hard to find out what the what the

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:12.610
no hard to find out what the what the
 

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:14.460
no hard to find out what the what the
company told the regulators of that

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:14.470
company told the regulators of that
 

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:17.220
company told the regulators of that
right well we were we were gathering

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:17.230
right well we were we were gathering
 

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:20.280
right well we were we were gathering
from every that's why we had to bring in

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:20.290
from every that's why we had to bring in
 

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:21.960
from every that's why we had to bring in
Lisa because it was just getting too

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:21.970
Lisa because it was just getting too
 

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:24.389
Lisa because it was just getting too
huge we had all this science and when

00:11:24.389 --> 00:11:24.399
huge we had all this science and when
 

00:11:24.399 --> 00:11:26.850
huge we had all this science and when
you're trying to advance a story you can

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:26.860
you're trying to advance a story you can
 

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.889
you're trying to advance a story you can
tell a great story but we wanted to back

00:11:28.889 --> 00:11:28.899
tell a great story but we wanted to back
 

00:11:28.899 --> 00:11:30.660
tell a great story but we wanted to back
it up with the science even if it was

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:30.670
it up with the science even if it was
 

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:32.730
it up with the science even if it was
just a parenthetical phrase or maybe a

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:32.740
just a parenthetical phrase or maybe a
 

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:36.120
just a parenthetical phrase or maybe a
paragraph so all of that research we

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:36.130
paragraph so all of that research we
 

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:39.600
paragraph so all of that research we
were doing and and I think that we were

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:39.610
were doing and and I think that we were
 

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:41.759
were doing and and I think that we were
sort of learning what like with the EPA

00:11:41.759 --> 00:11:41.769
sort of learning what like with the EPA
 

00:11:41.769 --> 00:11:44.280
sort of learning what like with the EPA
that the fact that they were talking to

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:44.290
that the fact that they were talking to
 

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:47.400
that the fact that they were talking to
me the federal government isn't exactly

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:47.410
me the federal government isn't exactly
 

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:49.620
me the federal government isn't exactly
cooperative on many levels you will find

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:49.630
cooperative on many levels you will find
 

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:52.710
cooperative on many levels you will find
out but I think they were hoping that we

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:52.720
out but I think they were hoping that we
 

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.110
