00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.906
- [Voiceover] Hello
grammarians and hello Paige.

00:00:01.906 --> 00:00:02.739
- Hi David.

00:00:02.739 --> 00:00:03.705
- Today we're gonna be talking

00:00:03.705 --> 00:00:05.893
about commas in correspondence

00:00:05.893 --> 00:00:08.025
and what that means is how to use commas

00:00:08.025 --> 00:00:12.508
in letter writing, so saying
hello and saying goodbye.

00:00:12.508 --> 00:00:15.737
When you start writing letter
or an e-mail to somebody,

00:00:15.737 --> 00:00:19.460
you use commas so let
me show you an example.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.997
So if you're writing a letter to someone

00:00:20.997 --> 00:00:22.912
you open it with something like this.

00:00:22.912 --> 00:00:24.797
Dear Prudence comma

00:00:24.797 --> 00:00:26.847
I received the plum jam you sent me.

00:00:26.847 --> 00:00:29.993
You can see we have this little comma here

00:00:29.993 --> 00:00:32.456
because what commas do,
right, is that they separate

00:00:32.456 --> 00:00:34.929
elements of the sentence from one another.

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:37.523
So what we're doing
here with this comma is

00:00:37.523 --> 00:00:40.161
we're putting it after the
greeting to separate it

00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:43.314
from the body text. So
that's how you begin

00:00:43.314 --> 00:00:45.490
a letter or an email

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.998
with a comma after the, you know,

00:00:47.998 --> 00:00:52.184
dear part or the hello Prudence comma part

00:00:52.184 --> 00:00:53.309
you know, whatever it is,

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.316
but Paige, how do you use
commas toward the end

00:00:56.316 --> 00:00:58.383
of correspondence of emails and stuff?

00:00:58.383 --> 00:01:01.901
- Great, so at the end
of a letter or an email

00:01:01.901 --> 00:01:04.185
you'll use a comma in
a sort of similar way

00:01:04.185 --> 00:01:05.735
to how you use it at the beginning

00:01:05.735 --> 00:01:09.560
so you'll say something like with love

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.898
comma

00:01:10.898 --> 00:01:12.481
Bruce Ben-Bacharach

00:01:16.982 --> 00:01:21.149
- So okay, we can use them
at the beginning like this.

00:01:23.834 --> 00:01:25.593
Dear Prudence comma

00:01:25.593 --> 00:01:28.710
or we can use it at the end.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.249
The endings of letters.

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:33.012
So this has a technical name.

00:01:33.012 --> 00:01:34.980
We were discussing this
before we started recording

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.037
so if you open a letter,
that's called the salutation

00:01:39.037 --> 00:01:41.537
which is another way to say hi

00:01:42.904 --> 00:01:47.071
and the way you end a letter
is called a valediction

00:01:49.887 --> 00:01:50.970
which is like

00:01:51.855 --> 00:01:55.742
saying hail, I think
wale in latin means hail.

00:01:55.742 --> 00:01:57.492
I think salu is hello

00:01:58.725 --> 00:02:01.864
and wale, or vale is goodbye

00:02:01.864 --> 00:02:04.324
and so this is really just like a

00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:07.354
helloining and a goodbye saying

00:02:07.354 --> 00:02:10.144
so if you're saying hello
in a letter or an email

00:02:10.144 --> 00:02:12.283
you use a comma. If you're saying goodbye

00:02:12.283 --> 00:02:13.606
in a letter or email...

00:02:13.606 --> 00:02:14.439
- Use a comma.

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:15.974
- You can learn anything. David out.

00:02:15.974 --> 00:02:16.891
- Paige out.
