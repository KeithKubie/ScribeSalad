00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.620
When you're thinking about
a longer presentation,

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.110
it's often best to start with the
building blocks of your elevator pitch.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.430
The who, what and why for your app.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.240
And use that as a basic set up for
a story.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.180
You'll have to tailor the story
to your audience, but generally,

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.700
you can talk about a group of
people who have a problem, and

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.560
then talk about how your
app addresses that problem.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.430
To tailor your story to your audience.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.580
Take time to present to someone like
the people you'll be presenting to and

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.950
ask them which parts
resonated with them.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.751
It's very likely they care about
different parts of your app than you do.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.010
You can make a story around
the development of your app as well.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.570
Your prototyping process has given you
a lot of check points along the way, and

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.710
a lot of user feedback to work
with in building that story.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.200
Often, the story will look
like we saw the problem and

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.570
came up with the solution,
that's your first prototype.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.870
When we tested that solution though,

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.970
there were challenges
pointed out to us by users.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.140
Because of their feedback,
we developed our concept further and

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.970
have arrived at this
shiny new prototype.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.570
When you share your current
prototype with an audience,

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.330
be sure to share it natively.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.430
If you're building an Android or

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.645
iOS app, pass some phones around the
table with your prototype pre-installed.

00:01:05.645 --> 00:01:09.110
If you're building a web app,
make sure your audience has laptops and

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.250
can interact with it themselves.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.580
You'll know you've done this right,

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.350
if people in the audience explore your
prototype, find something they like, and

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.810
show it to the person
sitting next to them.
