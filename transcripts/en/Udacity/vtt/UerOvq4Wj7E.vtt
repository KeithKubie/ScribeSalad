Design is a very common cognitive activity. Some people even claim that

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.000
design is a single cognitive activity that has the most economic value of all

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.570
such activities. Configuration is a type of routine design,

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.200
that occurs every single day. For example, you need to run some errands.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.180
You know the roads, you know the vehicle, you know the traffic patterns.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.070
Now you need to configure the specific route that can optimize some

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.330
constraint such as time. Cooking is another everyday example of configuration.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.000
We know the recipes, which tell us about the high level plans and

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.210
the ingredients we need to assign values to specific variables that can optimize

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.330
some constraints such as taste. Notice that we can separate task from method.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.820
Configuration is a task that can be addressed by many methods. We will look as

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.888
several of them, such as [UNKNOWN]. Plant refinement, [UNKNOWN] test, and so on.
