00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.130
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: Hi, my
name is Matt Barton.

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.140
I'm the curator of
recorded sound

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.110
for the Library of Congress.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.110
Most of the time though I'm
usually down in Culpeper,

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.000
Virginia in this building
that you see here.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.860
But I provided a bit of help

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.960
to the baseball exhibit
that's currently

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.630
on I think through next season.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.920
Through next June, perhaps.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.070
You have ample opportunities
to see it.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.130
Anyway, I helped them out
with a few audio clips,

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.860
and I begged them, please,

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.450
please let me come
to the big city.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.400
And they said OK.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:56.910
So, here we are and this
particular event here

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.590
in the Whitall is
sponsored by the Serial

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.420
and Government Publication
division.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.880
And who is responsible for
collecting and providing access

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.140
to seriously published,
serially,

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.280
and seriously published
materials

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.000
and government documents?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.170
And for baseball research
the most important research

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.950
materials in the SGPD
collection are newspapers

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.940
and baseball periodicals.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.240
Newspapers are one

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.330
of the baseball researchers'
chief sources for accounts

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.140
of major league, minor
league, collegiate,

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.730
and local baseball games
and related events.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.300
The division's newspapers

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.870
and current periodical
reading room provides access

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.550
to newspapers from around
the U.S. and the world.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.520
Through original
issues, microfilm,

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.760
and numerous newspaper databases
that make electronic searching

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.380
for newspaper content possible.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.860
SGPD collections also include
pulp fiction and comic books,

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.990
which contain baseball and
other sports related materials.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.310
The newspaper and current
periodical reading room is

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.360
located in room 133

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.370
of the Madison Building
right across the street.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.700
And I recommend it, I'm a
pretty good customer there

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.250
when I'm in town.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.730
And as I say, I'm with
the recorded sound section

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.000
which is part of the
motion picture broadcasting

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.660
and recorded sound
section and we have

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.610
over 3.5 million recordings
in that collection.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.560
And a large component
of it is broadcast.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.230
And I thought it
would be fun just

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.470
to bring three very brief
clips of noted sports writers

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.550
from broadcasts going back
to the 1930s, just to kind

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.620
of set the stage and
show off our collections.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.970
So, moving right along.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.340
There we go.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.760
Grantland Rice was born in 1880

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.920
and was a pioneer
and a sports writer.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.880
This is from 1935 he had his
own radio show at that time

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.180
and he later had one

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.870
in the 1940s called Grantland
Rice's Sports Stories.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.560
And as you'll hear, he seems
a bit stiff and that's not

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.190
because he lacks skill as a
speaker, its because in radio

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.880
at that time the networks were
scared to death of two things.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.040
One was running over
and the other was

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.220
that somebody would say
something they shouldn't say.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.370
So, radio was very
tightly scripted,

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.290
and I think its quite
obvious that he's reading

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.960
from a script even though he
may have written it himself.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.540
And he tries to be casual,
but it's a little awkward.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.840
But here we go.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.840
&gt;&gt; Ford, anyone who can explain
the Cardinals can explain the

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.360
Einstein theory, the income
tax, why men get bald,

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.580
how to cure a cold, and the
mystery of life in general.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.760
One answer is that they
play just about as well

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.370
as they feel like playing.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.780
They're much better
when coming from behind.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.180
They found themselves nine
games back of the John's

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.620
and then won sixteen of
the next seventeen starts

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.380
to take the lead for
about, just about two hours.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.830
They have been hitting
the bumps ever since.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.550
They still have a great
ball club whenever they feel

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.470
like hustling hard
enough to win.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.230
But they are not front runners.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.930
&gt;&gt; Would you like to make
a prediction at this point

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.680
about the national
league race Grant?

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.900
&gt;&gt; I'll be honest and say
Ford that I would not.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.910
Too many crazy turns
have already taken place.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.440
Whoever figured a month ago

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.810
that the Cubs would
get any such pace.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.810
They've been crawling up
the league for a month.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.110
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: Ok.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.410
We'll move ahead
about twenty years

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.510
to a slightly more relaxed
period of radio broadcasting.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.160
Here's the great
columnist Red Smith.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.580
I don't know how
well you can read

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.250
that at the top of his column.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.560
This is a column from '63
and it's headed "The writers

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.280
who lost all those
games for Nat's."

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.960
He's writing about
the Nats of the 1960s

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.430
who were not a great ball club.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.720
But he's sounding off on
something that I don't know,

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.040
you all must have dealt
with at some time or other,

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.970
the management of
the club objecting

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.180
to the negative coverage they
were getting from the press.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.670
So, but that's not the
subject of this clip.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.150
Its, the subject is Connie
Mack at a game that Smith saw,

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.100
where two men wound
up on third base.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.580
&gt;&gt; The A's started making
a perfunctory argument

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.090
for a double play.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.890
Got nowhere until Connie Mack
stuck his nose out of the dugout

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.400
and waggled a finger and Joe Rue
came running in, because Connie

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.390
of course couldn't go on the
field not being in uniform.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.610
And Connie said to him,
don't you think Mr. Grieve,

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.340
Willie Grieve was not
any of the four umpires,

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.290
don't you think Mr. Grieve,
that the minute that man went

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.140
out into third base, Boudreau
had passed him on the baseline,

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.370
and so was automatically out and
of course that man was tagged

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.710
out in left field, so
it's a double play.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.570
Joe Rue said thank you sir.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.010
And there were ten
thousand people in the park,

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.620
and it tickled me that
Connie was the only man

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.000
who could call a play right

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.580
and the umpire's name
wrong in the same sentence.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.530
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: And finally,
from 1963 an interview

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.930
by Studs Terkel of Eliot Asinof
a sports writer best remembered

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.600
for writing Eight Men Out.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.990
He wrote several other
books on sports and he was

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.690
in fact had been a minor
league ball player himself.

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.230
So, here's a comment, he reads
a brief portion of the book

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.040
and he makes a comment towards
the end of this interview.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.600
&gt;&gt; As the impact of
the confession sank

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.000
in the American people were
first shocked and then sickened.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.180
There was hardly a major
newspaper that didn't cry

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.760
out its condemnation
and despair.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.180
Henceforth the ballplayers
involved were called the Black

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.160
Sox, but the scandal was
a lot more than a betrayal

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.770
of a set of ball games.

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.660
Even more than of
the sport itself,

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.390
it was a crushing blow
at America's pride.

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:52.080
Now, when you have faith in
something and its betrayed,

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.370
then you are less apt to
believe anything else.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.590
Believe in anything else.

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.730
And people started thinking

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:03.220
that if you could fix
the world series then

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.250
by gosh you could fix anything.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.910
And pretty soon a
cynicism developed

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.930
that everything was fixed.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.530
And if everything was
fixed, then let's see

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:19.500
if we can fix something too.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.390
And once you feel that, then
the whole breakdown starts

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.700
and I mean if a man lies,
then you're less apt

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.750
to believe him a second time.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.010
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: And we'll
return to the bucolic setting

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:37.120
where I work every day.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.150
Alright. So, time to introduce
our panelists and like the pros

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.250
that they are they
sat down in the order

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.230
of the introductions here from
right to left, so, you know.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.850
I didn't tell them to do that.

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:50.830
First of all, we
have Chelsea Janes

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:52.770
who is the Washington
Post beat writer

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:54.900
for the Washington
National at the Nationals,

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:58.250
and she has covered the
team since the fall of 2014.

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:01.390
Before working for the Post,
she interned at USA Today

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:04.610
and the San Francisco Chronicle
and covered the San Diego Padres

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:07.670
as an associate reporter
for MLB.com.

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.480
Ms. Janes has an undergraduate
degree from Yale University

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:15.190
and a Master's in Communications
from Stanford University.

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:18.630
Jon Meoli covers the Orioles
for The Baltimore Sun.

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:20.170
A Connecticut native
and a graduate

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:24.070
of Loyola University Maryland
he joined the Sun in April 2014

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.140
after nearly three
years covering news

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.790
for the Towson Times.

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:29.240
When he's not writing
about baseball,

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.260
Mr. Meoli coaches the undefeated
Loyola University Maryland

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.170
women's club hockey team.

00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:41.520
&gt;&gt; Jon Meoli: They're going to
be really happy to hear that.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:45.930
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: Do you
want me to read it again?

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:49.180
And Greg Swatek covers sports
for the Frederick News Post

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:50.480
and in this position writes

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.070
about the Frederick Keys a farm
club for the Baltimore Orioles.

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:56.330
He has worked at the
Pittsburgh Tribune Review

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.600
and covered sports for the
Hannover, PA Evening Sun.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.810
Mr. Swatek attended the
Robert E. Morris University

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:05.710
in Moon Township,
Pennsylvania and has a degree

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:08.710
in communications
and media production.

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:12.510
Welcome to the Whitall Pavilion
at the Library of Congress.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:17.420
[ Applause ]

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.720
So, we're going to
have, you know,

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.400
as free ranging a discussion
you know, as time permits.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:28.420
And we'll have some time for
questions towards the end.

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:31.600
I thought we could start
by each of you talking

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.100
about you know, just your day.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.210
Obviously, the baseball
season is over,

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:38.510
though there still are
baseball stories to cover

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:42.290
so it may be good to talk about
the contrast between, you know,

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:46.610
the thick of the season and
you know, the offseason.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:48.790
Anyone care to kick it off?

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:50.090
&gt;&gt; Chelsea Janes: Sure.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:53.000
&gt;&gt; Jon Meoli: You worked
most recently it seems.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.160
&gt;&gt; Chelsea Janes: Yeah,
well the difference

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.590
between the offseason, for
me, and the regular season is

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:02.680
that during the season there's
a lot of time at the park

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.230
and not necessarily
a lot of action,

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:05.530
but you know where everyone is.

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:10.700
In the offseason
there's a lot of action

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.530
that you don't know is
happening and no one

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:14.610
around to talk about it.

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:16.480
So, you just sit
and panic basically.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:20.680
I actually just got back a
couple hours ago from California

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.740
where the GM meetings were held.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.940
And those in the winter
meetings are like the highlights

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.240
of the offseason,
and basically consist

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.990
of just widespread
professional loitering.

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:36.790
Like everyone just stands
around and we try to get people

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:38.810
to tell us things they
don't want to tell us,

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:40.380
or they try to get
us to write things

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.160
that we know are probably
helping their cause

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.460
but no one else is.

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:47.560
So, its-one of the questions
people ask the most is

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.350
like what do you do
when the season's over?

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:53.210
And its mostly sleep
and just panic

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:54.580
that you're missing
something, so,

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.290
especially when Bryce
Harper is a free agent.

00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:01.170
&gt;&gt; Jon Meoli: Yeah, I guess
just to elaborate on that.

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:02.580
We didn't go out
to the GM meetings,

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:06.880
but mostly because the Orioles
don't have a GM or manager

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.620
or mostly scouting staff,
or a coaching staff.

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:14.570
So, that's kind of what
my day's been like.

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:18.130
It's been, every day is
kind of wondering whether

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:20.830
that day's going to be the
day that they make the hire

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:24.860
and set off the chain of events
that's going to, you know,

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.890
allow things to start happening
again I guess I should say.

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:30.630
But this has been a process,
at least personally for me,

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:32.500
this last month has
been really quiet.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.550
The Orioles are keeping
it quiet on purpose.

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:37.380
So, its not really getting
out to the national writers

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:40.300
who keep, I know,
keep me up at night.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.920
And whenever my phone buzzes
with an alert from one

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.460
of them you just pray
that its about one

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:47.090
of the other twenty-nine
teams and not yours.

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:48.390
So, it's been relatively quiet.

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:51.250
Its been, you know, not stress
free, but a lot less stressful

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:53.010
than I expected it would be.

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:55.210
But Chelsea pretty
much nailed it

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:56.880
with the season versus
offseason.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.950
Its like this season your
day is dictated by, you know,

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:02.390
you're getting to the park
around 3:00 and you're going

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:05.110
through the same set of
circumstances and then all

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:08.210
of a sudden its over and
you go into this other mode.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:11.700
This offseason mode where
you're trying to catch up

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.500
but also not get left behind.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.290
Catch up on the sleep but
also not get left behind on,

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:18.600
you know, the professional
aspect of it, so.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.520
It's a unique balance,
definitely.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.350
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: And covering
the Frederick Keys I get to wait

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:25.320
for the Orioles to do something
and as Jon just alluded to,

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.460
not much is happening
right now, so.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.110
The cool think about
my job is I get

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:31.700
to cover these guys
before they're big stars.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.140
They're much more
accessible, they're much more,

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.890
they're not as leery or as
tired of media coverage,

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:41.570
so its much easier to talk
to them in my job than it is

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:44.660
for Chelsea and for Jon to talk
and interview these guys too.

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:47.040
You get some pretty cool stories
when they haven't had all

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.020
that media exposure, so.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:53.050
It's what I enjoy about my job.

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:56.540
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: You though,
you cover a pretty broad beat,

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:57.870
you know, not just baseball.

00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:59.640
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: Yeah, I
cover college basketball,

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.270
I cover some high school stuff.

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:06.370
I cover just features in
general that we have to write.

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:08.910
So, my job's a little more
broad than just baseball.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:10.210
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: Yeah.

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:14.200
Do you find though covering
an A team that you know,

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.490
maybe you're a little
better positioned

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:19.030
for the kind of scuttlebutt or?

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:22.800
Just you know, like oh, they're
looking for a left hander

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.750
or they need a right-handed
hitter?

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:27.890
You know, the rumors, those
kind of things, reach you?

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:29.990
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: They do
sometimes when you're

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:32.530
in the clubhouse before the
games people are talking.

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:36.630
And again, the media attention
is much less where I am.

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:39.490
So, some people are more
willing to open up and talk

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:41.080
than they are in a
Major League clubhouse

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.710
where people are
much more guarded.

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:46.530
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: So, let's go
from the immediate offseason

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:48.540
to the beginning of the season.

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:51.770
What is that like
for a reporter?

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:53.720
&gt;&gt; Chelsea Janes: A
shock to the system.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.400
Yeah, it's a-spring
training is fun.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:01.940
I think its not quite as
accessible as you know,

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:03.240
you've probably experience.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.960
But I think it's, everyone's
like a little calmer

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.350
and you know, no one's
totally stressed out yet,

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:10.720
they're in Florida or Arizona.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.480
So, I think everyone sort of
eases in together you know,

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:17.360
and its, you know it
becomes everyday right away.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.160
So, I think everyone
sort of deals with that,

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.680
oh my goodness, here we go.

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:23.980
But you get in the rhythm
and everyone's pretty calm

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:25.740
because they haven't, you
know, they're still going

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:29.210
to hit five hundred and hit
sixty home runs and win,

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:30.830
you know, one hundred
and twenty games.

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:33.360
So, it's a fun experience
and you really get

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.740
to know the players
and coaches in a way

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.730
that you don't during
the season, when they,

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:40.980
at least in my experience, kind
of shut it down and are just

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:44.410
on the edge of their seats
and biting their nails.

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:46.070
&gt;&gt; Jon Meoli: And you
know, you asked about kind

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:49.140
of the daily schedule that we go
through, I don't know how it is

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:51.040
with the nationals,
but at spring training

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:55.250
with the Orioles our time
with the players is from eight

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:58.610
to nine in the morning and that
runs kind of completely counter

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:00.440
to everything that happens
the rest of the season.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:04.260
Its kind of a relic of I guess
the old days when they wanted

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.290
to run around and break a
sweat for an hour or two

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:08.050
and then go get in thirty-six

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:11.880
at whatever golf course was
nearest to their facility.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.250
They still do that, they pretty
much only play eighteen now,

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:16.320
because golf is a
little more expensive.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.060
But so, it goes kind
of in cycles.

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:20.780
You have the mornings and
then the afternoon games.

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.340
And then it's something like
you said, a shock to the system

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.510
when all of a sudden you go
from six, seven weeks in Florida

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:27.810
with one o'clock games.

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:29.900
And you know, eating
dinner at your condo

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:31.200
or your house or your hotel.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.770
To seven o'clock night games
and the last week in March

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:38.240
in New York City, its just,
you know, temperature wise,

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:41.390
you know, work environment
wise, its completely different,

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:43.080
so its like you said,
a real jolt.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.650
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: And I sit at
work jealous of people like Jon

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:48.970
and Chelsea because while I'm
freezing up here in Maryland,

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:52.540
they're down in Florida for six
weeks covering spring training,

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:53.840
so.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.700
So, the minor league
season kicks up,

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.130
I mean the rosters
aren't really set

00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:59.360
until spring training is over.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.890
So, we don't even know who's
going to be on the team

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:02.940
until like a week
before the season.

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:04.640
So, it's kind of
hard to do a lot

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.940
of prework not knowing
who's even

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:08.570
on the team before
the season starts.

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.360
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: Do you find, and
getting back to spring training

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.300
for a moment, you
mentioned like, you know,

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:17.530
one o'clock games and all
of that, I mean-Do you find,

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:20.280
is there still kind of a
romance about spring training?

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.180
I mean, for people my
age, and I'll tell you

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:24.190
that I'm fifty-seven,
so I remember

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:27.880
when day games were the rule and
night games were the exception.

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:31.910
It does seem at times like
yeah, that's baseball there,

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:34.240
playing in the sun,
you know, all of that.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:38.710
Is that still a, that
mystique still around?

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:40.010
&gt;&gt; Chelsea Janes: I think so.

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:43.360
Its, I think that its lost
on the players a little bit,

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.850
who are either thinking
why are we playing

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:49.370
so many spring training
games or why are these games

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:52.100
at one o'clock when our bodies
then suddenly have to be trained

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.780
to play at seven for six months.

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:55.810
So, I think its lost on them.

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:58.920
But it is a really neat like
fan environment and a lot

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:02.300
of the people down there are
just very relaxed or very like,

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:06.030
in the know about what's
happening, because they get it.

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:09.540
So, it's a cool baseball
experience definitely.

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:10.840
&gt;&gt; Jon Meoli: Yeah, one of
the first times I ever went

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:12.540
down to spring training
was, I was still in college

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.140
and I was working for
a website that did

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.540
like minor league
stuff for the Red Sox.

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:18.800
[Inaudible] basically cover
the prospect before anyone had

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.000
really heard of him and the
site sent a couple people

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.810
down to spring training
every year

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:24.140
and it was always cool to me.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.580
I mean this is like, as nerdy
as it gets, but just going

00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:27.880
down there and it
being you know,

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.020
going from Baltimore
in March to Ft.

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.320
Meyers in March.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.080
And then there's
hundreds of people spread

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.690
out across the minor league
complex just playing catch

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:38.500
and taking BP and you know,
its not so much like that

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.760
at the major league camp,
because these guys are kind

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.610
of jaded and you know,
they're there for so long

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:43.910
and they're basically
just over it.

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:46.610
But, when you get that many
people in one small place

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:48.920
and all still have that thing

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.960
that gets lost once
you've made it,

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.590
everyone's still
trying to make it.

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:53.890
That's what's cool.

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:55.940
That always gets me and
whenever I get back down there,

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:57.950
I try to remember that, because
I haven't been doing this

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:02.320
for long, but I'm sure you
know, I could get to that point

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.850
where I lose that too.

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:05.700
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: And,
what's the beginning

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:07.320
of a minor season like?

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.720
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: Its
cold, usually.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:14.440
The weather's probably in the
upper 40s and stuff like that.

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.050
And there's an air
of excitement.

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:17.810
I mean, people come out to
the park because they want

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:19.690
to see the young prospects,

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:21.400
the people they've been
reading about all spring.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:29.490
So, they want to see who the
next great players are going

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:30.790
to be.

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:32.090
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: And, I mean,

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:33.780
in the time that you've been
covering baseball, I mean,

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.930
could each of you talk
about what are, you know,

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:39.520
some of the really great moments
that you've been around for?

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.760
Have covered, have
written about.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.800
I know these have not been the
certainly the greatest times

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:50.620
for the local teams, although
the Orioles were doing well just

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:51.920
a couple of years ago.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.220
&gt;&gt; Jon Meoli: At one point.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:57.380
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: The old,
I mean the good old days.

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:58.680
&gt;&gt; Jon Meoli: Yeah, I'll start.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.110
One of the things
that stands out to me,

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:01.620
I wasn't on the beat
then, but I was working

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.360
on the Sun sports staff when
they had the empty stadium game

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.530
up there in Baltimore
a couple of years ago.

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:10.830
Nothing will ever
be as interesting

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:14.760
and surreal and bizarre as that.

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:18.240
And what always strikes me
when I think about that game,

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:21.880
honestly, is you know, there
were more media at that

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.890
than there were at opening day
that year at Cameron Yards.

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:26.880
You know, people came from out
of town, basically everyone.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.220
Once they heard it was
happening, national media wanted

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:30.680
to come up, everyone
wanted to be there.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.520
It was a packed press box

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.850
and those were pretty much the
only people in the stadium.

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:38.600
And there was a chuckle when
they announced the attendance,

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:43.270
as they do every game, and they
said today's attendance is zero.

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:47.520
And some people with the team,
you know, got mad about that

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.590
because of everything that it
represented with what was going

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:53.420
on in the city and just you
know, the economic impact

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:55.310
that it had on the
team, and just kind

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:57.000
of the baseball impact.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
And you realize that that game,
which got national attention,

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.530
was, meant a lot more
than just a baseball game.

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:07.540
In Baltimore and to the people
who are there working it

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:08.840
and the people who
are playing it.

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.270
I mean the people who were
playing it I don't think wanted

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:11.760
anything to do with
it at that point.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.690
Chris Hale gave up like five
runs in the first inning,

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:15.710
he was just like,
I'm out of here.

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:18.080
Let's get on a plane
and go home.

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.550
But it was just something
that I'll never forget,

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:25.100
and I hope never, obviously,
never has to happen again.

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:26.400
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: I got
to cover a no hitter.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.700
A minor league no-hitter.

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:31.980
So, wasn't thrown by a Keys
pitcher, it was Henry Owen

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.530
who is a big, tall, lanky, 6'7,

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:37.920
left hander in the
Red Sox organization.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.850
He pitched for the
Salem Red Sox and he got

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:41.150
through six no hit innings.

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:43.530
And in the minor leagues its
interesting, because it's

00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:44.830
about developing the players.

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:47.270
Like the pitchers are on
a very strict pitch count,

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:50.680
so even if they're pitching
great and throwing a no hitter

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:51.980
that doesn't guarantee

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:53.280
that they're going
to stay in the game.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.730
So, so Henry Owen's
worked six innings

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:58.240
and then three relievers came in

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.010
and maintained a
no hitter for him.

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:02.860
So, it was a really
cool thing to get

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:05.400
to cover a no hitter even
though it wasn't my team

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.960
that was doing the no hitting.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.290
&gt;&gt; Jon Meoli: So, I was
actually at that game.

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:09.590
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: Were you?

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:10.890
&gt;&gt; Jon Meoli: Yeah, I was there.

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:12.190
And I asked him after, I was
like, you ever done that before?

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:14.280
And this is like a
California, like big, tall,

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:15.580
blonde hair, like
California bro.

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:16.880
I was like you ever
had a no hitter before?

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.810
He's like yeah, I threw a few
every year in high school.

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:24.080
So., I think we thought it
was a bigger deal than him.

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.380
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: Right.

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:27.020
&gt;&gt; Chelsea Janes:
Yeah, I, it's hard to,

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:29.650
I feel like I've been
lucky to see most

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:31.640
of the stuff that I've seen.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.310
But the home run derby
was really cool this year.

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:37.920
And I went in very
cynical, honestly.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:43.660
I sort of had seen Bryce Harper
become a little jaded about it

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:46.340
and not really want to
talk about it and it felt

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:49.590
like he felt he had to do
it, because he had, you know,

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:51.310
kind of said so a
couple years ago.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:53.320
Oh, if its at home I'll do it.

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.940
And I felt like he felt forced.

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:57.410
And then as the night,

00:21:57.410 --> 00:21:59.500
and he didn't even take
batting practice on the field,

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.860
like it was like, I've
got to get through this.

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:04.430
And then as the night went on
you sort of saw him realize

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:06.890
that this meant a
lot to him, too.

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:08.420
You know, it meant
a lot to everyone,

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:10.980
but I think he sort
of came back to life.

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:13.380
Because he's changed a lot,
even in the last four years.

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:15.220
I think this contract
has weighed on him.

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:18.290
So, it was cool to just
see him kind of explode

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:21.280
and like actually just
relax and have fun again.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.960
So, it sounds corny, but
that was kind of cool,

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.930
because its been a little
hard to watch Bryce sort

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:28.420
of get consumed by all this.

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:30.740
I mean, he's always been
in the middle of it.

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:32.790
But I think the contract's
weighed on him a lot.

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:35.880
And it was fun to just see kind
of old Bryce who doesn't care

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:38.890
and knows he's better than
everyone just kind of go

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:41.400
out there and enjoy that.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.700
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: Another
cool thing

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:44.330
for me covering the Keys
was Branden Kline who's

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:45.630
from Frederick.

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:49.670
He was drafted by the Orioles
in the second round in 2012,

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:52.580
I want to say, out of the
University of Virginia.

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:55.670
And he was the opening
day starter I think

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:57.020
in 2013 for the Keys.

00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:59.820
So, here's a kid that I covered
in high school now pitching

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:03.370
in his home town, which is
rare in the minor leagues,

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:05.140
and pitching professionally.

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:07.870
So, it was cool to see that
evolution from high school.

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:10.510
I covered him in college at
Virginia and now he's pitching

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:14.900
in his home town for the
Keys, so that was cool.

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:18.250
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: It sounds
like, I'm starting to hear,

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:19.970
I'm hearing the writer
voices here, but I'm starting

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:21.980
to hear the fan voices.

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:24.760
You know, the following,
getting interested

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.690
in a player, following them.

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:28.250
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: We are
fans, we just can't cheer

00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:31.710
in the press box and
stuff like that, so.

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:33.010
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: Yeah, I mean its

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:34.310
like people ask me what's
your favorite recording.

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:35.750
And its like, well, all of them.

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:37.050
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: Right, exactly.

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:38.350
Who's your favorite child?

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:39.650
And stuff like that.

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:41.330
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: Exactly.

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:45.260
So, you all travel with
the teams I guess then?

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:50.030
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: I do
occasionally, not full time, no.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:53.640
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: How is-what's
a road trip like for you?

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:58.450
Quite a strain I imagine?

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:03.150
&gt;&gt; Chelsea Janes:
Its an experience.

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:05.840
So, like, we don't
fly on the team plane.

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:09.680
The T.V. people do but
we're not on that level.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.720
Which I think is good,
that would be a lot of time

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:13.400
with a lot of the same people.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.780
But no, it's really interesting.

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:19.330
I think one of the
kind of major things

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:23.650
in a baseball clubhouse is like,
you know, your credibility.

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:27.280
And if you're there on the
road and at home, you know,

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.990
you're kind of going
through it with them.

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:31.940
Like they know you stayed up
until whatever time to hit

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:35.310
that red eye or you're up
at six and you see them

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:37.190
across the country the next day.

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:39.710
So, there's a lot of
credibility that comes with it

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:43.810
and you sort of, you know, get
to see them in strange elements.

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:45.130
You know, normally you're
not running into them

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:49.480
on the street here, but you get
in the Starbucks line in X city

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.610
and you kind of say, you
know, you do the like hey,

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:54.660
I don't see you, but I see you.

00:24:54.660 --> 00:25:00.620
So, it's really cool and
I've been in a Chipotle line

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:03.800
with a nationals
player while someone

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.190
in that line was
wearing his jersey

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:08.020
and didn't realize he was there.

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:12.490
So, I kind of like, was
like, and he was like.

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:14.560
So it was, its like,
its stuff like that

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:18.330
where you realize how cool it
is that you know these people

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:19.830
on this level that
you almost take

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:21.670
for granted seeing
them in that setting.

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:24.250
But I don't want
to call it bonding,

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:26.090
but there's a certain
shared experience that comes

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:27.900
with being on those road trips.

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:30.360
Though they are long and usually
by the end of them I have

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:33.450
to sign off twitter because
I'm tired and cranky, so.

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:35.760
&gt;&gt; Jon Meoli: You mentioned
the shared experience.

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:39.100
Its interesting now to see,
you know, as players put

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:42.150
out like everything, they
do on all their social media

00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:44.260
that you're doing the same
things most of the time?

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:48.310
Like you're going to a
certain city that has you know,

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:51.450
in Cleveland they're all
riding around on those scooters

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:54.190
that are everywhere and going to
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:55.720
And you know, you run
into players you know

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:58.000
at like the Negro Leagues
Museum, stuff like that.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.700
But the biggest difference
in terms of work environment

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:04.060
at home versus road, the road
has a lot more going with it.

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:07.520
You know I live ten minutes away
from Camden Yards so I can get

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.910
to the park at three o'clock,
leave my house at you know,

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:12.460
2:45 and there's no,
none of the extra stuff.

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:14.460
But there's a lot
more people around.

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:17.180
It seems a lot more intense.

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:18.920
The road, I don't know how
it is with the nationals,

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.640
but we don't really travel with
a lot of Orioles writers so,

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:24.640
you're really, if everyone
allows it and you know,

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.960
kind of stays in, if we all stay
in our own lane and don't like,

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.690
you know, overlap on
what we're trying to do.

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:33.340
Or you know, get into the petty
grievances that can develop

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:35.800
in a baseball beat, you can
kind of just get your work done

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.180
and be a little more relaxed
during the game on the road.

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:41.650
It's just all the ancillaries,
the early morning wake ups,

00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:46.360
the travel, the hotels, that
can get a little bit of a grind.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.810
&gt;&gt; Chelsea Janes: And an
interesting, oh sorry-

00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:49.110
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: No,
go ahead Chelsea.

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:51.310
&gt;&gt; Chelsea Janes: And just on
that point, the players often

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:52.650
at least for us hide at home,

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:54.740
because there's more
cameras, there's more people.

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:57.910
So, they're in the training
room when they're you know,

00:26:57.910 --> 00:26:59.390
they're taking their
time with their food

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:00.900
where you can't talk to them.

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:03.870
So, a lot of them are more
willing to be out there

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:05.740
on the road and at
their locker just

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:09.150
because there's fewer
writers and no T.V. cameras.

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:11.020
And the writers that
are there they know,

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:12.910
because they're with
them every day.

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:14.210
&gt;&gt; Jon Meoli: And
its just as simple

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:15.510
as they don't know
where to hide there.

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:17.690
&gt;&gt; Chelsea Janes: That's
true, also true, also true.

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:18.990
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: Its interesting,

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:21.060
because in the minor leagues
its mostly small towns.

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:24.650
They don't have major
airports to fly into.

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:27.520
They don't have extensive
restaurant selection.

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.150
So, it's mostly small towns,

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:31.260
you're on a bus most
of the time.

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:32.600
The players are on a bus.

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.380
Some of the trips
are really long.

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:38.190
I think from Frederick to Myrtle
Beach it's a ten-hour bus ride.

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:41.860
And you're getting it at like
six or seven in the morning, so-

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:43.250
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: And this
is the Carolina League?

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:44.550
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: Yeah, the
Carolina League, right.

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:46.510
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: Is Frederick
the northern edge of that?

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:48.260
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: They are on
the northern edge of it, yeah.

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:52.910
So, its just a lot of small
town traveling and bus rides.

00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:55.230
You don't know where your
next meal is going to,

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:59.300
where you're going to go to
eat, and stuff like that.

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:04.090
So, it is interesting
traveling in the minor leagues.

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:05.390
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: Yeah.

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:09.380
What are, what's a game
day like at home though?

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:11.640
If you have day or evening.

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:14.130
I imagine with a day game
you've got less time to prepare.

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:18.690
&gt;&gt; Jon Meoli: Yeah so, I guess
a typical night home game

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:21.590
for the Orioles we would
get access to the players

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:24.920
from 3:10 to 4:00 o'clock.

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:27.030
And you know, they're
arriving at that time.

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:28.330
Some of them are already there.

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:32.030
But they're mostly trickling in
and eating, doing all, you know,

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:33.630
the early, early work.

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:36.030
We would get, have
the manager's press.

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:37.330
When Buck Showalter
was the manager,

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:39.380
I don't know how the
new guy might do it,

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:43.490
we would have the manager's
press conference around four.

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:48.460
So, then we would basically
get 4:30, 4:45 if we wanted

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:52.240
to go out, you know,
try to get people

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:54.120
on the field during
batting practice.

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:56.150
And then its basically
just writing.

00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:58.590
You know that 5:00 to 7:00
range is just writing.

00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:04.260
This is going to be my fourth
season covering the team

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:06.020
and the fourth different
way we're going

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:07.930
to cover the game basically.

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:09.580
So, we would have,
we basically made it,

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:12.190
so we have a pregame story

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:13.900
and our full notebook
all before the game

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:15.390
and then you write
about the game after.

00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:17.040
So basically, just adding
an element because of

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.150
when our paper goes to
print and deadlines.

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:21.000
Making sure that
everything, you know,

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.830
people who are subscribing,
regardless of the deadline,

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:25.130
get everything that's
accounted for.

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:27.970
But basically, you spend most of
that pregame time just writing.

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:29.910
And then you kind of
decompress and the game starts,

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:33.790
and you start back up around
fifth, sixth, seventh inning,

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:36.940
depending on how its going.

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:41.700
So, I think that, you know,
even five, ten years ago

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:43.580
that pregame time might
have been more down time.

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:46.240
Now it's almost when I
do the bulk of my work.

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.350
I don't know how it is for you.

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:51.750
&gt;&gt; Chelsea Janes: Oh
yeah, very similar.

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:55.690
Its also funny, you know,
the routine is so entrenched

00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:57.880
that you know, night games,

00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.620
you know we get there the same
time the players get there

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:00.920
at the same time.

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:03.390
So that, you know, I
know who I'll see walking

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:05.430
in if I'm five minutes
later than usual.

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:08.410
Because everyone's just so,
you know, on their routine.

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:11.400
And then when you have a
day game after a night game,

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:15.170
you know, you're kind of
wiping stuff out of your eyes,

00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:18.340
trying to like get your coffee,
and you know, you run into them

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:19.690
at Starbucks because
they're just,

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:20.990
they're doing the same thing.

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:22.290
And its just so funny.

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:23.590
Like the rhythm is just so set

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:25.890
that you know exactly
who's going to be where,

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:28.060
who's going to walk
in late, you know,

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:30.730
so it's the writing
rhythm is very similar

00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:32.080
to I think what they
go through in

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:34.460
that its just every
single day to the point

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:35.970
that you don't have
to think about it.

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:38.720
And if there's like a 3:05 start
everyone's like oh my gosh,

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:41.590
when do I get to the park,
you know you text people.

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:44.200
Remember its 3:05 you know,
because your body is just

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:48.790
so geared toward one, and
four, and seven, and any change

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:50.980
to that absolutely
messes with everyone.

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:52.280
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: Yeah,

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:55.400
in the minor leagues the
clubhouse availability window

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.700
might not be quite as long,

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:59.310
but I'd say the one difference
is everyone's willing to talk.

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:01.970
I mean if you want to talk to
someone you can go up to them

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:03.270
and they're willing
to talk to you.

00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:05.200
Whereas Chelsea and John
probably deal with folks

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.930
that are hiding in
the training room,

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:08.340
that don't want to
talk that day.

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.840
So again, just the
access is much better

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:12.140
in the minor league level.

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:16.470
And just the process of
working a game, I mean,

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:19.300
some people don't realize
it, most editors want stories

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:22.150
like as soon as the, within
five minutes of the game ending.

00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:25.410
Well, I'm sure Jon and Chelsea
have horror stories about this.

00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:27.870
But if there's a dramatic
change in the bottom

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:30.870
of the ninth inning and you're
wrapping up your entire story

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:33.950
on deadline and rewriting
your entire story on deadline,

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:35.540
it can get tricky sometimes.

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:38.560
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: Yeah, that
actually reminds me of a story

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:41.530
that Chelsea wrote in August

00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:46.120
when the Nats had played just a
beautiful game against the Cubs.

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:48.110
Went into the-

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:50.210
[ Laughter ]

00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:53.390
Oh, you remember it too?

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:57.270
Ok. I mean, so I can just
imagine, you know, the entire,

00:31:57.270 --> 00:32:01.340
the tone, the arc, everything
had to change because it ended

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:03.890
with a grand slam from the Cubs.

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:07.390
&gt;&gt; Chelsea Janes: And right
before that I was watching that,

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:09.790
and I turned to the other
writers and they're freaking out

00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:11.670
and they're rewriting
and I'm like look.

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:13.470
There are about sixty
thousand different things

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:16.750
that could happen and only one
of them ends this right now.

00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:19.330
And it happened.

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:22.420
And I like admitted that
to everyone involved later,

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:26.260
but yeah, there are
times, you just don't know.

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:28.320
One, I think it was
four years ago,

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:31.490
Max Scherzer threw a no
hitter in the second game

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:34.180
of the double header,
in the rain,

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:36.010
the day before the
last day of the season,

00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:42.170
when I think there had
been a choking before that?

00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:44.150
Or maybe to come?

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:47.670
And then Matt Williams was going
get fired and we all knew it.

00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:49.080
So, it was like this crazy week

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:52.610
where you're thinking we can't
deal with one more thing.

00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:55.580
And it gets to be the fifth
inning and I'm like no Max,

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:57.530
this would be great,
but I just can't today.

00:32:57.530 --> 00:33:02.170
And so, we're in like, you know,
it's the sixth inning, I'm like,

00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:03.470
its not going to, he's
not going to do it.

00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:05.060
He's not going to do it.

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:07.810
And that's a terrible attitude
but it never happens, right?

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:09.110
He does that all the time.

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:10.410
And I'm like you
wouldn't do this to me.

00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:14.610
So, he gets through the seventh
I'm like oh my gosh here we go.

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:18.500
And so, you know, I send
the story, its like frantic,

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:21.070
its probably not very good.

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:24.210
Max is extremely happy, he has
some drinks before he comes

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:25.880
to the press conference

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.050
and Saturday the
deadlines are earlier.

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:30.790
So, I'm sitting in this press
conference with you know,

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:36.100
very happy and well-hydrated Max
Scherzer who's taking his time.

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:40.130
And I get a text from my
editor that said call me now.

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:42.480
So, you know, I finally get
out of there, I'm like hey,

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.250
we just finished up, its
going to be awhile and he's

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:46.500
like no its going
to be ten minutes.

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:48.490
And I said no, I'm
still downstairs.

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:50.670
He's like, you're giving
me this in ten minutes.

00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:53.490
And it had been truly a terrible
story the first time around.

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:56.720
You know, it was rushed
and unexpected, so.

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.190
But so, I ran upstairs and
probably swore at everyone

00:33:59.190 --> 00:34:01.500
in my way and tried to give
him something in ten minutes

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:05.130
and I like, I cannot read that
story because I'm so afraid

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:07.030
of what it actually
looked like at the end.

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:08.340
But it was pretty funny.

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:09.640
I told Max about that later.

00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:11.670
And he's like yeah, if you'd
told me I would've taken longer,

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:12.970
so.

00:34:12.970 --> 00:34:14.890
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: The
nice thing is we do get

00:34:14.890 --> 00:34:17.720
to rewrite the story
for later editions

00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:20.700
and for the website too, so
it's a better finished product

00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:22.670
by the time the process is over.

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:27.390
But that first draft can
be pretty rough sometimes.

00:34:27.390 --> 00:34:28.710
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: So, there's
the, there are the games

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:31.440
where everything
changes at the very end.

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:36.700
But also, Jon you wrote a
piece the last day, you know,

00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:39.980
Buck Showalter's last
day managing the Orioles.

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:42.690
Very good piece,
very interesting,

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:45.320
if you want to look
it up online.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:48.590
And you must have known
that was coming though.

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:49.890
&gt;&gt; Jon Meoli: Yeah, yeah.

00:34:49.890 --> 00:34:51.910
I mean, it was actually one
of those awkward things.

00:34:51.910 --> 00:34:54.360
You know, he didn't want
to talk about it at all,

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:55.950
that whole leading up to it.

00:34:55.950 --> 00:34:59.910
And after he didn't want to
talk about it, and it was one

00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:02.370
of the more bizarre moments
I've ever been a part of.

00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:03.920
Like after we got all
the players, you know,

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:06.090
Adam Jones talked about how nice
it was, everyone cheered him,

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:07.570
they basically made the
whole day about him.

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:09.420
And that was what
Buck Showalter wanted.

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:10.720
He wanted to be that [inaudible]

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.970
and all the time he
gave to the Orioles.

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:16.200
But some of the writers
wanted to like,

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:18.080
go into Buck's office
and say goodbye.

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:25.360
But like, because no one really
knew what was going to happen

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:33.710
and like, it might have,
you know, everyone kind

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:36.540
of expected what
was going to happen,

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:40.330
but nobody knew for sure.

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:45.950
So, we're all waiting, you
know, this is a Sunday.

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:49.610
A 3 o'clock game.

00:35:49.610 --> 00:36:00.750
Like, everyone has, everyone
wants to just get out of there,

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:04.200
they played one hundred
and sixty-two games.

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:09.490
So, we all just kind of went
in there and nobody actually

00:36:09.490 --> 00:36:13.090
like started the conversation.

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:19.950
So, we were kind of
just like standing there

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:27.600
for like ten seconds and
he's like, he just said like,

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:32.070
my wife tells me
I'm not good at this

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:33.910
and I'm going to
keep it that way.

00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:37.430
And then he shook
everyone's hands and

00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:39.410
but then we just
started talking about,

00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:44.050
like as if you would talk
about, like oh he was going

00:36:44.050 --> 00:36:46.270
to be back the next like.

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:52.130
Like oh, wonder what we're
going to do with this guy

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:55.900
on the roster and like this
guy's got to come off the DL.

00:36:55.900 --> 00:37:01.140
And it kind of showed just the,
you can get lost in the day

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:08.470
to day thoughts of baseball
and the beat and covering it

00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:11.310
and managing it and
coaching it and playing it.

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:15.090
And even when you're doing
something that's basically

00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:18.840
designed to you know,
acknowledge that that rhythm is

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:22.710
about to change completely
you can still fall back

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:25.500
into it, like that.

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:28.010
And no one really stopped it.

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:29.820
And no one really minded.

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:33.610
So that was kind of the
most interesting part

00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:34.910
of that day to me.

00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:36.230
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: I read a
piece though that you wrote

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:40.490
after the last game
of Keys this season.

00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:43.470
And although I think
they finished fourth

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:45.140
in the Carolina League?

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:46.440
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: Yeah.

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:47.740
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: Yeah, not
a banner season, you know.

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:52.670
Although they did better towards
the end than at the beginning

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:55.030
and its striking
for its optimism.

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:59.070
It was about everything the
team seemed to have going

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:01.220
for it towards the end.

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:02.520
Strong pitching, and-

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:03.820
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: Well, yeah,

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:06.680
a lot of the best Orioles
pitching prospects played

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:08.060
for the Keys this year.

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:11.740
Alex Wells who was played
in the future's game.

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:16.980
You have Zac Lowther, a lot of
good left-handed pitching too.

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:19.250
So, the minor leagues
is where the hope

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:23.860
and the optimism reside,
because the future is bright

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:25.580
for everyone.

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:29.790
At the time we don't know how
its going to play out yet,

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:34.610
so the narrative is still
in its very early stages.

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:37.920
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: So,
we've talked a lot

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:41.510
about players and managers.

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:45.720
What's your relationship
like with fans?

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:47.020
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: Good question.

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:48.320
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: I imagine
there's a, you get a range

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:50.220
of reactions to what you write.

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:51.520
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: Me?

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:55.840
Not so much as Jon and Chelsea,
but its mostly positive.

00:38:55.840 --> 00:39:00.110
But people often say can
you ask so and so this?

00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:02.800
Or can you ask so and so that?

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.240
Or why did this happen?

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:07.460
You get a lot of questions
that people want you to answer.

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:09.360
&gt;&gt; Chelsea Janes: 95% of what
we hear from fans is I think

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.660
on point and very positive.

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:11.960
Because of how I think a
lot of our brains work,

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:13.260
people really remember
the negative emails

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:14.560
or the angry tweets and when
we're frazzles or, you know,

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:15.860
have kind of been through
a lot with the team

00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:17.160
or it's a bad stretch it
gets really hard to look

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:18.460
at social media and stuff.

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:19.760
Just because its like, I'm not,
I did not lose that game, right?

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:21.060
I am not going to
tell him to try this.

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:22.360
But that I think obscures the
reality of it, which at least

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:23.660
in D.C. there's been just like
a lot of very informed fans

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:24.960
and a lot of, I've
gotten a lot of emails

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.260
that are hey, why
is this this way?

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:27.560
And I'm like that is,
I don't know, you know.

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:28.860
So by and large really good
and its also really fun

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:30.160
because those are, just
like anything else,

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:31.460
those are people you
see every day too.

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:32.760
Right? The season
ticket holders,

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:34.060
they're at spring
training, you know?

00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:35.360
They can, you know, I've seen
some of those people every day

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.660
for four years, you know.

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:37.960
And it's a lot of
fun and there's

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:39.260
like a vocal section below the
press box that yells at us.

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:40.560
And that's amazing, especially
when its like rain delays

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:41.860
and there's no one there
and you can hear them,

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:43.160
and I think it brings me life.

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:44.460
So, its really cool to see those
people because they see the ups

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:45.760
and downs, they get it, and
its kind of fun to have people

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:47.060
that are there every
day that care.

00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:48.360
And its amazing how much they
care without having to care.

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:49.660
You know, because
even with having

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:50.960
to care every day
sometimes its hard.

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:52.260
Sometimes its hard to get in the
weeds and think of new things.

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:53.560
But the energy people
have for it is awesome.

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:54.860
&gt;&gt; Jon Meoli: Yeah, I was kind
of chuckling just that you know,

00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:56.160
because just like Chelsea
said you're going to hear just

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.460
as many positive things as
you are things the other way.

00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:58.760
But I was laughing because
I feel like my inbox,

00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:00.060
my email fills up like every
time I write even one word

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:01.360
about Chris Davis.

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:02.660
And its like people
who are like,

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:03.960
why doesn't he go
to an eye-doctor?

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:05.260
And like, why doesn't he like
hold his bat on his shoulder?

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:06.560
And why don't they try this?

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:07.860
And why don't they try that?

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:09.160
And why don't you ask
like if they bench him?

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:10.460
And you know its interesting.

00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:11.760
People are passionate,
you know, that's what.

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.060
You can have a complicated
relationship with feedback

00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:14.360
like that, but at
the end of the day,

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:15.880
that's why we're doing this.

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:19.740
You know, we might like to think
that we're doing this because,

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:23.030
you know, it beats like,
you know, a regular job.

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:26.720
And it beats, you know,
its beats the alternative.

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:29.080
But we're doing this to kind
of communicate these things.

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:31.140
So, I always have
to kind of remember

00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:32.860
that you might not be
able to phrase things

00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:34.160
in the way that the fans want.

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:37.070
Like, you know, why doesn't
Buck bench that block head?

00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:40.210
You can't say that,
but you have to realize

00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:42.030
that these are the questions
that people are asking,

00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:43.920
and you can't wholly
ignore them.

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:45.220
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: And
its interesting too,

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:47.180
because you go online and you
see there are all these comments

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:50.320
on your stories and then you
always take a deep breath before

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.570
you click on the
comments, because its like,

00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:53.870
is it going to be good?

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:55.170
Is it going to be bad?

00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:56.470
Is it going to be about me?

00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:57.770
Is it going to be
about the team?

00:40:57.770 --> 00:40:59.070
So, it's always interesting
what people weigh in with

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:00.570
on the comments section, so.

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:02.020
&gt;&gt; Chelsea Janes: You're
bold to look at the comments.

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:05.520
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: I'm going
to learn to stop one day.

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:06.820
&gt;&gt; Jon Meoli: We
turned ours off.

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:08.120
There're no more comments

00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:10.880
on the Baltimore Sun
website, it's a beautiful day.

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:12.360
&gt;&gt; Chelsea Janes: Yeah,
we had to tell my mom

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:17.460
to stop reading the comments.

00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:18.960
She was very upset.

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:22.120
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: So, here we are
in the immediate post season

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:24.810
and I imagine when you meet

00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:28.200
with fans they often ask
for your predictions.

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:31.680
And so that's what
I'm going to do.

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:35.400
And you know, you shouldn't feel
the least bit of pressure just

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:38.560
because this is going to go
into the permanent collection

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:41.390
at the library of congress.

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:46.320
And forty years from now
people will be evaluating your

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:47.620
predictions, but-

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:48.920
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: Chelsea's
going to have to carry this,

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.230
because Jon and I don't even
know what our teams are going

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:52.550
to look like next year, so
its kind of hard to predict.

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:59.210
&gt;&gt; Chelsea Janes: What is there
to predict with a national team?

00:41:59.210 --> 00:42:00.510
What is there to ask about?

00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:01.810
I don't know.

00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:03.110
Predictions about the season?

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:04.410
Oh no.

00:42:04.410 --> 00:42:05.710
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: Well, you
know, I guess just look ahead.

00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:07.570
You don't have to predict
the won lost record

00:42:07.570 --> 00:42:10.990
or where they're going
to finish, just you know,

00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:12.380
what the-What are
the teams facing?

00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:14.190
What do you, you know,
what are they working

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:15.760
on now for next season?

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:18.260
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: Will Bryce
Harper be national next year?

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:21.050
&gt;&gt; Chelsea Janes: I can
honestly say I have been asked

00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:25.290
that question more
than a thousand times.

00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:28.390
More than probably
fifty times this week.

00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:31.880
And my answer has
changed almost every day.

00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:34.980
I think like since we,
and I hate predictions,

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:36.280
I liked hearing him
say, you know,

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:38.700
I would not like to
give a prediction.

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:40.450
Because I never want to,

00:42:40.450 --> 00:42:42.960
and we have to do media
predictions every year.

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:45.450
And you know, they post
them after the season,

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:47.000
they always look
absolutely terrible,

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.450
and I can't, I just can't do it.

00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:54.070
But, with Bryce I've
been trying to do it

00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:56.970
for three years, I feel like.

00:42:56.970 --> 00:43:00.080
And, will he be national
next year?

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:03.300
No is my prediction.

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:04.600
I don't, yeah, no.

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:07.810
And I think I've said
that more often than not.

00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:09.950
But I've also hedged
a lot, but no.

00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:13.230
I'll go out on a
limb for posterity

00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:15.310
and say St. Louis Cardinals.

00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:16.960
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: Ok.

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:19.370
&gt;&gt; Jon Meoli: That's a good one.

00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:21.000
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: By the way,
in case anybody is wondering,

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.080
in 1935 it was the Cubs
who got the pendant

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:25.420
and not the Cardinals, so.

00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:27.810
&gt;&gt; Jon Meoli: I was laughing at
like somebody on sports radio

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:30.920
like questioning athletes''
effort ninety years ago too.

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:34.730
That's kind of how it goes,
not a lot has changed.

00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:36.810
In terms of prediction
for the Orioles,

00:43:36.810 --> 00:43:42.400
its going to be a rough couple
of years as they kind of figure

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:47.660
out how to, I mean rebuild
is the word, but they have

00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:50.330
to modernize pretty much
everything in the organization.

00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:55.320
They took money from every facet
to build a major league roster

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:57.360
that they thought could contend

00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:58.660
and they made the
playoffs twice.

00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:01.250
And you know, if Buck
Showalter had used Zac Britton

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:03.630
in the wildcard game two
years ago, three years ago,

00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:05.460
they might have made
a run there.

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:07.400
And if they didn't run
into the rails in 2014,

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:09.140
they might have made a run
there, but it didn't work out.

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:11.230
So, they're, it's going
to be a lean few years,

00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:14.640
but I'm interested to see
how much of what's worked

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:18.830
around the game in the last
decade or so is applied here.

00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:24.100
And how much it works under
this sized market circumstances.

00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:27.720
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: I mean,
its almost as though,

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:33.070
I was living in, I'm from the
Boston area, but I was living

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:35.710
in D.C. when the Nats arrived.

00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:41.310
And it's almost like, you
know, as old a franchise

00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:44.080
as the Orioles are, you
know, they're kind of,

00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:48.370
you know, starting from zero.

00:44:48.370 --> 00:44:51.340
Starting, you know, reinventing
the wheel for the team.

00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:52.640
&gt;&gt; Jon Meoli: Yeah,
and I was looking at it

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:55.160
when the Astros were in town
the last week of the season.

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:56.540
You know, they're a
team that's held up.

00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:59.470
They basically tore it down
to the studs and made a lot

00:44:59.470 --> 00:45:02.620
of high draft picks and
invested a tun of money

00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:05.300
in their farm system
and analytics.

00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:07.030
And there was only
one player who was

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:09.950
on their last team before they
really decided they were going

00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:12.790
to do all of that, who was even
around for the world series

00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:15.080
and that was Jose Altuve, one
of the best players of baseball.

00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:17.140
Like, all these guys that we're
seeing the Orioles are bringing

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:18.940
in and saying oh,
is this person going

00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:20.310
to be here through the rebuild?

00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:21.610
Its like, they might
be here for it,

00:45:21.610 --> 00:45:23.760
but if they're any good
they're going to get traded

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:25.830
and they're going to get
players who are better

00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:27.150
than them for the future.

00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:30.640
So, we're talking about, you
know, as Greg was talking about,

00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:32.790
waves and waves of players
who aren't even going to get

00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:36.040
to experience winning baseball
if things go as planned.

00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:37.810
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: And
the cool thing for me

00:45:37.810 --> 00:45:39.470
with the Orioles is I get to
see a lot of these players

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:43.350
that they're playing for and
a lot of this young talent.

00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:45.020
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: Is that
something that people talk

00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:46.420
about though with the Keys?

00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:48.610
You know, to succeed
they must be.

00:45:48.610 --> 00:45:49.910
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: They do, yeah.

00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:51.210
Its like, who are the
stars going to be?

00:45:51.210 --> 00:45:53.960
Yeah. Its interesting watching
their fans after the game

00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:57.320
and what players they gravitate
to, because you can sort of tell

00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:58.620
who they're interested in

00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:00.560
and who they think the next
big player's going to be.

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:03.450
Depending on who they approach
and what, who they want

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:05.240
to sign their baseball cards

00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:06.910
and their baseballs
and stuff like that.

00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:09.190
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: Yeah, we've
heard a bit about the superfans

00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:11.060
for the O's and the Nat's.

00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:13.700
Do the Keys have a
kind of superfan too?

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:15.000
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: They do.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.300
They do, there are fans that
have been going to games there

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:18.860
for thirty, forty, even
in some cases fifty years.

00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:22.880
So, and its cool seeing a lot
of the same ushers and a lot

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:24.980
of the same people just
working around the ball park.

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:29.250
It's a cool small-town vibe.

00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:30.650
So.

00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:34.360
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: Ok, well we're
getting, you know as they used

00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:36.390
to say in radio, the
little clock on the wall.

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:39.440
Well this is my little
clock on the wall.

00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:42.630
So, we're coming down to
about ten minutes here

00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:46.440
and I think maybe we could
open it up for questions.

00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:49.950
But just don't ask, sorry.

00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:52.930
Oh yes, we need a mic runner.

00:46:52.930 --> 00:47:00.730
Just don't ask them
to make predictions.

00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:04.140
I made that mistake for you.

00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:05.440
Who's first?

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:09.260
Let's start to the far
left, my far left over here.

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:12.460
&gt;&gt; Hi, obviously since
like Grantland Rice

00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:15.550
and the old days sports
writing in general has changed.

00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:18.360
Any broad comments
about the scope of that?

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:21.280
From like, can Rosenthal
cite the Athletic,

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:23.970
which is behind a paywall,
versus like ESPNation,

00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:26.740
which isn't, versus the
Dailies which you work at.

00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:28.810
And just your thoughts
on you know,

00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:32.250
how a fan necessarily
reads about their team.

00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:36.110
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: Its just
much more instantaneous.

00:47:36.110 --> 00:47:39.160
I mean, you're kind of glued to
your phone all the time waiting

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:42.740
for things to happen or
you're on the phone trying

00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:44.060
to break news and
stuff like that.

00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:46.730
Its just a much more 24/7
world that we live in.

00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:50.020
That's the biggest
difference to me, so.

00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:52.290
&gt;&gt; Jon Meoli: I think that
through all those things,

00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:56.540
the keys that I think
distinguish, you know,

00:47:56.540 --> 00:48:00.410
some of the, I guess legacy
media and the newer stuff,

00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:03.670
and even you know something like
the Athletic is, it really comes

00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:06.220
down to access and presentation.

00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:10.080
So, if you're writing
for a website off

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:12.580
of the game broadcast
that the people

00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:14.170
who are reading it off of.

00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:17.200
You know, you might have good
insights but its hard for people

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:21.180
to necessarily connect with that
in a way and say oh, this is,

00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:24.470
you know, written
authoritatively.

00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:30.260
Versus if you do have that
access, I think it still needs

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:32.030
to be presented in a way
people want to enjoy it.

00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:35.110
You know, I know that you have
to like, we have to source stuff

00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:36.760
and we have to cite
it appropriately

00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:40.140
and our papers have
standards, but you still want

00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:42.440
to write things and present
them in a way that people enjoy.

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:44.720
You know, I don't, like,
I hate reading things

00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:46.220
that are bogged down, you know.

00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:48.530
It might make it feel like
this person has sources,

00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:49.860
because they say it
in every sentence,

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:51.260
like, its not a fun read.

00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:54.560
Its not a fun, you know, reading
experience and its probably not

00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:55.860
as fun of a writing experience.

00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:59.350
So, I like to make it, I like to
try to remember that, you know,

00:48:59.350 --> 00:49:01.190
I guess it boils
down to you guys want

00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:02.490
to read what I want to write.

00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:04.070
Or write what I want to read.

00:49:04.070 --> 00:49:07.010
And I try to use the access
and you know, the privilege

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:09.120
that we have of covering
it to make it

00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:11.850
so that people feel
that way too.

00:49:11.850 --> 00:49:16.110
&gt;&gt; Chelsea Janes: Yeah, I
think also something, you know,

00:49:16.110 --> 00:49:18.460
a lot of the blogs, you know,

00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:22.580
don't get the same
access at Nationals Park.

00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:25.200
Which is fine, but some
of them are very diligent

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:28.280
and would know more than some
people that do get sent there.

00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:32.310
But, what's really, I guess
interesting about the dynamic is

00:49:32.310 --> 00:49:37.660
that there are a lot
of sources online.

00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:39.600
Or you know, trusted people

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:43.170
that don't have the same
accountability standards as,

00:49:43.170 --> 00:49:46.160
you know, some of the, like as
you phrased it, legacy media.

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:51.660
So, you know, if a rumor gets
thrown out there, you know,

00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:54.690
we have to chase it and say no

00:49:54.690 --> 00:49:56.970
when we already know
that its not true.

00:49:56.970 --> 00:49:59.620
But it's a response
we have to make.

00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:03.730
There's an awkward and
uncomfortable shutting

00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:06.520
down of other people's
reporting that happens,

00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:09.560
and it shouldn't get there,
because there's no reason

00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:13.900
to have wrong things, but you
know I could never just kind

00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:17.730
of say I heard X thing
if I wasn't 100% sure.

00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:21.920
Even when I am 100% sure I'm
terrified that I'm wrong.

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:24.060
So, its really interesting
how kind

00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:26.730
of they set the agenda
sometimes.

00:50:26.730 --> 00:50:31.120
But, yeah its, like you said,
it just makes it more, I think.

00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:35.570
A lot of responding to things
and Ken Rosenthal just,

00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:41.300
you know, I don't know how
that guy sleeps, but yeah.

00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:43.260
People like him push
everybody else.

00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:46.310
And he's incredible,
he's a great person

00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:49.790
and deserves every scoop he
gets because he works so hard.

00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:53.470
But he sort of forces
all of us to follow suit

00:50:53.470 --> 00:51:01.180
in a way that I think is good.

00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:02.480
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: Where's the?

00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:05.410
Oh, there we go.

00:51:05.410 --> 00:51:06.710
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:10.620
Chelsea you just recently
broke a story, two days ago,

00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:12.460
about the offer that the
Nats extended to Harper

00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:15.400
and I'm wondering for each
of you, like so you got

00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:16.700
that information from a source.

00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:18.000
And I'm wondering how each

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.420
of you cultivates the
relationships you have

00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:23.230
with your sources over
the course of the seasons

00:51:23.230 --> 00:51:25.540
to make those types of stories?

00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:31.550
&gt;&gt; Chelsea Janes: I think
I did it really slowly.

00:51:31.550 --> 00:51:34.700
I wouldn't even say
that I, I don't feel

00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:38.650
like I've cultivated
enough sources.

00:51:38.650 --> 00:51:41.050
But its, I remember when
I first came on the beat,

00:51:41.050 --> 00:51:44.800
I was very demoralized because
no one would tell me inside

00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:46.270
information right
away, you know.

00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:48.410
And then eventually I
sort of realized, well,

00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:51.460
they're probably not going
to do that by me, you know,

00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:53.470
asking them a lot of
questions or you know,

00:51:53.470 --> 00:51:54.770
kind of getting in their face.

00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:57.190
Its if I'm there and I
don't bother them every day.

00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:59.600
If I'm there and I kind of can
talk to them about other things.

00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:02.500
That they realize I'm not
just here to you know,

00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:03.800
mine them for information

00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:05.660
that will help me
Tweet something first.

00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:11.200
So, it was a lot of long
game for me, and patience.

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:13.540
And just building trust, truly.

00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:14.840
You know having someone slip

00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:17.280
and say something they shouldn't
have said or tell me something

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:19.080
and then say hey,
that's off the record.

00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:22.340
You know, and say Ok, but
I'm going to come back to it.

00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:25.050
You know, and just kind of
making sure I'm trustworthy.

00:52:25.050 --> 00:52:33.000
So, yeah that took, I had
the number for awhile and had

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.360
to confirm it, and so its
still even hard with sources,

00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:39.260
because you never want to take
one person's word from it,

00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:40.830
especially with contracts.

00:52:40.830 --> 00:52:42.740
Right? Because both sides
have an incentive to lie.

00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:46.630
So, while I trust a lot of the
people, I talk to regularly

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:48.220
that one was, it was
a stressful night.

00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:50.180
Because I needed somebody
to tell me I was right.

00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:53.050
I didn't want someone
else to get it first.

00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:55.790
I figured it was right, but you
can never have enough sources

00:52:55.790 --> 00:52:57.090
that know what's happening.

00:52:57.090 --> 00:52:58.510
And it's a long process.

00:52:58.510 --> 00:53:01.080
&gt;&gt; Jon Meoli: Yeah, I
guess just to add a little,

00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:02.940
it is a long game
more than you think.

00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:08.050
And I think everyone that gets
into this line of work has

00:53:08.050 --> 00:53:09.350
that feeling at the
beginning where you're

00:53:09.350 --> 00:53:11.560
like how do all these people
know all these things?

00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:12.960
And why don't I?

00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:16.250
And it takes building that
trust and it takes you know,

00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:20.770
doing the kind of work
that its not just,

00:53:20.770 --> 00:53:22.600
you realize that your
communication with these people

00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:25.230
who are going to talk to you
aren't just the phone calls

00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:27.960
and the texts and you know,
walking you to your trailer,

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:29.260
you know outside the clubhouse.

00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:31.890
Its what you put out
there on a daily basis.

00:53:31.890 --> 00:53:34.580
I think that's what I've
learned, especially recently,

00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:39.330
is that people know who's
writing what and they know

00:53:39.330 --> 00:53:42.730
where its coming from
and if you're able

00:53:42.730 --> 00:53:45.860
to communicate what you know
and how you know it in a way

00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:48.610
that might also give
some deniability

00:53:48.610 --> 00:53:50.910
to whoever's saying it,
that makes a big difference.

00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:53.660
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: I would
just add, it starts often

00:53:53.660 --> 00:53:55.710
with just an informal
conversation

00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:57.010
about everyday life.

00:53:57.010 --> 00:53:58.310
Hey, how's it going?

00:53:58.310 --> 00:54:00.070
Or what'd you do this week?

00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:02.870
Or just little small
steps you take lead

00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:04.860
to bigger relationships

00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:09.150
and could provide some
valuable information

00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:10.530
for you down the road.

00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:11.830
You just have to be patient.

00:54:11.830 --> 00:54:14.170
It doesn't all happen every
day or when you want it

00:54:14.170 --> 00:54:15.470
to happen necessarily.

00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:16.770
But if you take that time

00:54:16.770 --> 00:54:18.360
to build the relationship
it will be there

00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:20.350
for you when you need it.

00:54:20.350 --> 00:54:21.650
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: Ok, we're
running short on time.

00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:23.890
I know we have at least
two more questions.

00:54:23.890 --> 00:54:25.220
Where's the microphone?

00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:28.320
There was someone in the back,
so you did you have a question?

00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:31.780
Ok, so you and then you sir.

00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:33.180
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:35.610
Bryce Harper announced I
guess before the beginning

00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:38.220
of last season he wasn't
going to talk about contracts

00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:42.100
at all and he pulled it off.

00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:45.620
And of course, if a
politician tried that

00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:47.640
or a press secretary
it would never work.

00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:51.160
The editors would demand
that he or she be harassed

00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:52.840
with the same kinds
of questions.

00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:54.300
How did you feel about that?

00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:56.780
Were you resentful that
he drove the agenda?

00:54:56.780 --> 00:54:58.560
Were you relieved that
you weren't going to have

00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:00.950
to badger him all the time?

00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:03.230
I mean how did that work?

00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:05.770
How did you feel?

00:55:05.770 --> 00:55:08.350
&gt;&gt; Chelsea Janes: I, I know
why that was a big deal,

00:55:08.350 --> 00:55:11.740
but I think for me it didn't
change the reality much.

00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:14.600
Bryce had dodged those
questions for a long time.

00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:18.200
So, it was sort of like saying,
you know, we weren't going

00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:20.580
to hear Bryce say oh,
I'm focused on right now,

00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:22.210
you know, sixty thousand times.

00:55:22.210 --> 00:55:26.260
So, but it was off-putting
because he said you know,

00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:27.560
I'll walk out of the room.

00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:30.120
Its like, Bryce you don't,
its ok, you know, we're not,

00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:31.420
no one's trying to catch you.

00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:32.840
You know, if you
don't want to talk

00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:34.620
about it, we'll respect that.

00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:39.260
But it was, like you
say, a strange dynamic

00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:41.730
because our job is to
ask him over and over.

00:55:41.730 --> 00:55:45.370
But I think if we hadn't,
you know, if it were sort

00:55:45.370 --> 00:55:47.780
of a lesser guy who
hadn't been in the center

00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:49.510
of that for a long time.

00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:52.270
You know, who hadn't said
I'm focused on right now,

00:55:52.270 --> 00:55:53.570
I'm a national right now,

00:55:53.570 --> 00:55:57.580
for so long then maybe it
would kind of terrify me more.

00:55:57.580 --> 00:55:58.880
But I think in that case I knew,

00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:00.400
I could have told you
Bryce Harper's word

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:02.500
for word answer to
that question.

00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:06.700
But it, you know, we
kind of knew that,

00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:08.170
but visiting media didn't.

00:56:08.170 --> 00:56:11.540
So, it was funny to watch New
York Reporters and stuff come in

00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:13.890
and try to get him to answer.

00:56:13.890 --> 00:56:16.190
Like someone went at it,
you know they got creative.

00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:18.580
You know, somebody's
asking him, you know,

00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:19.880
you like your beard huh?

00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:21.630
Because the Yankees
don't allow facial hair.

00:56:21.630 --> 00:56:25.170
And he was like, what?

00:56:25.170 --> 00:56:29.250
And then he figured it
out and he was like, no.

00:56:29.250 --> 00:56:31.920
But it was really
awkward in a way

00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:33.920
that was greatly amusing to me.

00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:37.680
So, but it was a
strange dynamic for sure.

00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:39.720
And then you started to
notice him slipping at the end

00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:41.020
of the year though, too.

00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:43.920
You know, and he, it was
almost like he was kind

00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:46.840
of slowly breaking into
answering those questions more.

00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:49.480
But I remember the day that was
declared I was like alright,

00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:53.060
well I guess I just will
say Bryce Harper declined

00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:54.360
to comment.

00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:55.660
You know.

00:56:55.660 --> 00:56:56.960
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:58.260
&gt;&gt; Jon Meoli: So, we kind of
had, I don't want to- We kind

00:56:58.260 --> 00:57:00.880
of had the opposite of that in
Baltimore with Manny Machado

00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:06.590
who welcomed that attention
and those questions often and,

00:57:06.590 --> 00:57:08.320
in every city, that we went to.

00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:09.730
They went to New York
the first weekend

00:57:09.730 --> 00:57:11.790
of the season happened there.

00:57:11.790 --> 00:57:14.990
When they went to Los Angeles to
play the angels at the beginning

00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:18.280
of May, it was right when
whichever Seager they have,

00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:20.300
Corey Seager got hurt.

00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:22.580
So, the Dodgers were
off that day so all

00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:24.780
of L.A. media was
there asking Manny

00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:26.800
and that one he played
like he had no idea.

00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:30.110
But then it happened again
in Chicago at the White Sox

00:57:30.110 --> 00:57:31.760
when the Cubs had an off day.

00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:34.740
So, all of Chicago media was
there and Manny showed up in

00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:38.990
like a $2000 Gucci
sweater and wore sunglasses

00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:40.960
for the interview and was
talking about how he might

00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:42.260
like to play in Chicago.

00:57:42.260 --> 00:57:44.150
And it happened again
in Philadelphia.

00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:47.060
It pretty much happened
everywhere where there's a lot

00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:49.710
of free agent, you know, there's
a lot of free agent money.

00:57:49.710 --> 00:57:52.100
So, it's interesting to see,
and I think our columnist wrote

00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:53.860
at the same time, you know, look
what's happening down there.

00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:55.630
Bryce Harper just said
he's not going to do it

00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:57.740
and he hasn't done it
and its not a circus.

00:57:57.740 --> 00:58:00.730
But on the flip side for
me, like the first day

00:58:00.730 --> 00:58:03.720
of every road trip can be a
little hectic, and if you know

00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:06.360
that Manny Machado's going to
get asked if he wants to play

00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:08.910
for the Cubs next year right
when he walks in the door,

00:58:08.910 --> 00:58:11.680
that's an easy story
to just kind of run

00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:12.980
with it and say thank you.

00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:15.910
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: And people
always want to talk to me,

00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:20.130
so I don't know what Jon and
Chelsea are talking about, so.

00:58:20.130 --> 00:58:21.670
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: Ok, one more.

00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:26.190
Ok we're here, sir you
get the walk off question.

00:58:26.190 --> 00:58:27.490
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:58:27.490 --> 00:58:33.040
I got here about a half hour
late, I got stuck in traffic

00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:36.770
on Route 50 as I'm coming
in from the airport.

00:58:36.770 --> 00:58:38.480
So, this question
may have been asked

00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:40.800
or may have been
discussed already.

00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:46.750
Being sports writers
now for big newspapers,

00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:48.900
or in your case in Frederick-

00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:54.660
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: We like to think
of ourselves as big city, so.

00:58:54.660 --> 00:59:03.580
&gt;&gt; What is the, normally
what would be the projection

00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:13.230
of what your ambition would
be as to what you aspire to?

00:59:13.230 --> 00:59:19.150
You know, in light of the
fact that newspapers have

00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:22.410
so much economic pressure

00:59:22.410 --> 00:59:26.090
that they've probably cut
back employment [inaudible].

00:59:26.090 --> 00:59:31.090
Like [inaudible] newspaper
in Ohio is not published

00:59:31.090 --> 00:59:34.460
for home delivery every
day of the week its only

00:59:34.460 --> 00:59:37.730
like four days a week not
including the weekends.

00:59:37.730 --> 00:59:39.190
That's the number one question.

00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:42.950
The other one is, being
a Cleveland Indian fan

00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:45.590
in my generation, people from
[inaudible] Ohio just want

00:59:45.590 --> 00:59:47.120
to live long enough to see the
Indians win the world series.

00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:48.420
And unfortunately,
I think the window

00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:49.720
of opportunity is closed shut.

00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:51.020
Their best chance was in 2017.

00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:52.320
This leads up to the
Ubaldo Jimenez crisis.

00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:53.620
&gt;&gt; Chelsea Janes: Naturally.

00:59:53.620 --> 00:59:54.920
&gt;&gt; Jon Meoli: Three
walk off questions.

00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:56.220
You can't have three walk off
home runs, you only get one.

00:59:56.220 --> 00:59:57.520
&gt;&gt; That was the worst
starting pitcher

00:59:57.520 --> 00:59:58.820
that the Indians ever got,

00:59:58.820 --> 01:00:00.120
and he disappointed
everybody every time.

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:01.420
It took the Indians two years to
get him to where he could pitch

01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:02.720
up to his Colorado
Rockies potential.

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:04.020
And the question
I have is what was

01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:07.990
in Showalter's mind
not bringing in Britton

01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:11.570
in the playoff game
against Toronto.

01:00:11.570 --> 01:00:15.060
Ubaldo, as soon as he brought
in Ubaldo I shut off the T.V.

01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:17.260
&gt;&gt; Jon Meoli: Yeah, yeah.

01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:18.560
I guess we'll go backwards.

01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:19.860
What was in his mind?

01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:21.570
I think he really thought
that that game was going to go

01:00:21.570 --> 01:00:24.540
on forever and he just
had to save Zac Britton.

01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:27.840
I think that's part
of the, you know, end.

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:29.280
When you think about that game,

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:31.260
you could have watched
the playoff that year

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:34.090
without people mentioning that
and people started bringing

01:00:34.090 --> 01:00:35.410
in their best relievers
in the fourth inning

01:00:35.410 --> 01:00:37.560
and that's how playoff
baseball is right now.

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:41.100
So, I'm sure there's going
to be a book somewhere

01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:43.960
or a T.V. special retrospective

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:45.370
where the Orioles
are taking credit

01:00:45.370 --> 01:00:47.260
for how playoff baseball
is played

01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:48.560
for the rest of our lives.

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:49.860
&gt;&gt; Chelsea Janes: Ironically.

01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:52.770
&gt;&gt; Jon Meoli: Yeah, they didn't
mean to, but they did it.

01:00:52.770 --> 01:00:55.430
&gt;&gt; Did Showalter ever
explain what his reason was?

01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:56.730
Or he never?

01:00:56.730 --> 01:00:58.400
&gt;&gt; Jon Meoli: No,
he never really got

01:00:58.400 --> 01:00:59.700
around to the nuts and bolts.

01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:02.790
I think he just kind of was
riding with the-he's the closer

01:01:02.790 --> 01:01:05.200
and we weren't, you
don't use your closer

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:06.800
in a tie game on the road.

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:09.020
That was as good as we got.

01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:11.930
In terms of-- ?

01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:14.640
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: The
future of newspapers?

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:16.290
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: I'll
take a stab at that one.

01:01:16.290 --> 01:01:17.590
I think the good thing for all

01:01:17.590 --> 01:01:20.500
of us is I think what we do is
translatable to other mediums.

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:25.620
Like we could write for a
website, we could report

01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:27.860
for another media outlet.

01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:29.160
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: Or you
could do a podcast.

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:31.130
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: Right,
that isn't a print outlet.

01:01:31.130 --> 01:01:33.740
I think our job's
translate to other mediums.

01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:36.350
So, if newspapers die,
and I hope they don't,

01:01:36.350 --> 01:01:37.650
but if they die tomorrow,

01:01:37.650 --> 01:01:40.150
I still think we could
find similar lines

01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:45.140
of work doing what we do now.

01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:46.890
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: Anyone
else want to?

01:01:46.890 --> 01:01:50.280
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: What
was the second question?

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:52.590
Oh, ok.

01:01:52.590 --> 01:01:53.890
&gt;&gt; Chelsea Janes:
Its interesting,

01:01:53.890 --> 01:01:55.280
because you know obviously
the Post is very lucky

01:01:55.280 --> 01:02:00.320
to have had sort of the influx
of Jeff Bezos' money and with

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:02.420
that has come the opportunity
to try to figure out how

01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:05.900
to make this work for outlets

01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:07.350
that don't have Jeff
Bezos' money.

01:02:07.350 --> 01:02:10.900
And it's just been
interesting to see the evolution

01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:15.970
and I think the, you're
exactly right that you know,

01:02:15.970 --> 01:02:17.950
there's now a lot of ways
to go at this, right?

01:02:17.950 --> 01:02:21.190
You know, podcasts, I
wouldn't have listened

01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:23.440
to podcasts a couple of
years ago and now I get a lot

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:24.740
of information from them.

01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:26.040
I learn a lot.

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:30.630
And you know, video stuff is
important and even social media,

01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:32.170
you know using that
in a more creative way

01:02:32.170 --> 01:02:34.000
that reaches people
and draws them in.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.100
So, but what I think is really
interesting is I've noticed

01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:38.400
that a lot of the things

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:42.800
that the post has tried are
not original ideas, right?

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:45.290
Its people that have
had to kind of scrap

01:02:45.290 --> 01:02:47.950
and make it work you know
drive that new agenda.

01:02:47.950 --> 01:02:53.970
You know, podcasts and blogs and
the instantaneous kind of stuff.

01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:55.270
But people are making it work

01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:57.090
and I think you know the
Athletic's been really good

01:02:57.090 --> 01:02:59.210
for sports writing.

01:02:59.210 --> 01:03:01.180
Increased competition
a lot of the time,

01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:05.330
but that's thirty plus more
jobs for baseball writers

01:03:05.330 --> 01:03:08.620
that we're them at small papers,
that now get a chance to do kind

01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:10.170
of whatever they want.

01:03:10.170 --> 01:03:14.650
And I think it's, that's
a really good product,

01:03:14.650 --> 01:03:18.990
so its changing but like people
are kind of finding a way.

01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:21.370
&gt;&gt; Greg Swatek: The demand
for the information is there.

01:03:21.370 --> 01:03:23.100
I mean I think it will
be there going forward,

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:25.120
it's just the format in which
you receive the information,

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:26.640
that's what's changing.

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:30.100
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: Alright,
well I think we have

01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:32.630
to bring this to an end now.

01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:35.060
So, please, wonderful hand.

01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:46.760
Thank you all for coming.

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:49.610
Please visit the baseball
exhibit if you haven't already

01:03:49.610 --> 01:03:52.030
and if you don't have one
already go across the street

01:03:52.030 --> 01:03:54.450
and get yourself a reader's card
from the Library of Congress.

01:03:54.450 --> 01:03:56.550
That is your key to the kingdom.

01:03:56.550 --> 01:03:57.850
Thank you.
