00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.500
The nausea and vomiting experienced by mothers’
during pregnancy can feel awful.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:11.330
But could it actually be a good thing?

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.000
Hello former babies, Lissette here for DNews.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.440
Two thirds of all pregnant women report experiencing
morning sickness in their first trimester.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:24.090
It’s a common and sometimes debilitating
phenomenon that causes vomiting and nausea.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.900
But calling it morning sickness is actually
a bit of a misnomer.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.540
First, the nausea and vomiting can happen
anytime, day or night - not just the morning.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.880
And many scientists tell us it’s far from
being a sickness - in fact, it’s more like

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.980
the opposite.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.690
I know that sounds weird, but scientists have
been looking into it for a while and although

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.680
morning sickness is still a bit of a mystery,
there is growing research dating back to the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.129
1970s that says this nausea and vomiting is
good - for both moms and babies.

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:53.239
So how does that work?

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.590
Well, there are a few different factors involved.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.430
But one of the biggest to keep in mind is
that embryos are much more sensitive than

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.430
adults.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.360
They’re tiny, at their largest only about
ten centimeters in the first trimester; And

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.600
their bodies and brains are still developing
so they’re more susceptible to small concentrations

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.320
of, well, anything.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.360
Food included.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.689
Many studies have found that certain foods
are more strongly associated with morning

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.360
sickness than others.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.909
This one conducted by researchers from the
University of Liverpool found that across

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.619
21 different countries worldwide, nausea and
vomiting rates were linked to consumption

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.500
of alcohol and meat.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.119
And another study published in the American
Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology found

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.979
similar results - also naming meat - but adding
strong tasting plants to the list.

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.000
It’s easy to see why mothers would be more
likely to reject alcohol - we’ve all heard

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.090
of fetal alcohol syndrome - now known as fetal
alcohol spectrum disorders.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.460
But what about meat and veggies?

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.590
Wouldn’t those be good for a growing embryo?

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.590
Not really.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.250
See adults can tolerate meat quite well - especially
the way we cook it today - but evolutionarily,

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.439
meats contained a lot of pathogens and made
people sick.

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.610
So it makes sense that women would have evolved
to reject meat while pregnant to keep our

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.610
little ones safe.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.020
And when it comes to veggies - many plants
like broccoli and cabbage actually contain

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.360
small amounts of phytochemicals, which make
them taste or smell bad to certain animals

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.930
and keep them from being eaten.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.680
But, while they might keep rabbits away, humans
can handle the tiny amounts of toxins found

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.660
in them; however, embryos’ tiny developing
bodies and brains cannot.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.950
They are much more vulnerable - especially
in the first trimester, which also coincides

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.400
with a higher prevalence of morning sickness.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.019
Together, these studies provide evidence that
nausea and vomiting during pregnancy helps

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:38.380
protect the embryo by having the mother reject
or expel foods that can cause harm.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.760
In fact, researchers at The University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill found that not

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.830
having any morning sickness is associated
with increased risk of miscarriage.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.950
But it’s not just helping to protect the
embryo, this nausea and vomiting may also

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.940
be protecting the soon to be moms.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.440
A study out of Harvard University, found that
when pregnant, a woman’s immune system is

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.740
sort of turned down - the theory behind it
being that this way her body won’t reject

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.230
the foreign genetic material of her embryo.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.480
But the woman’s suppressed immune system
also means that much like her little one,

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.430
she can’t as easily fight off harmful bacteria
and pathogens that are found in some foods.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.870
So the body will reject them.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.760
Now, that’s not to say that vomiting and
nausea is categorically good for pregnant

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.909
women- if it is extreme, women should definitely
see a doctor - but, a little here and there

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:26.569
seems be our bodies way of telling us what’s
good for us.

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.810
So many things can be bad for us when we’re
in the womb.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.659
But, what sort of things need to go right
in order to get pregnant in the first place.

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:40.040

is it to get pregnant?
