1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:01,540
Um,

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:05,020
so we want to finish the night with a
salute to a guy who's been on our program

3
00:00:05,021 --> 00:00:07,720
and part of our family pretty
much from the beginning.

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,710
I have known him for more than 35 years.

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,540
Early on when radio lab started,

6
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:16,150
I asked him if he'd help us out
and send us a few story ideas.

7
00:00:16,151 --> 00:00:21,010
He didn't send us a few. He sent us
bushels, tales of chemistry and medicine,

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,990
hallucinations, music people.

9
00:00:22,991 --> 00:00:27,910
So many extraordinary people that he
knew or found or help cause the guy just

10
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:30,490
doesn't run out. Dr. Oliver Sacks.

11
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,970
[inaudible] is a guy who noticed

12
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:40,430
is everything,

13
00:00:40,431 --> 00:00:43,580
is deeply interested in everything
that happens around him and to him.

14
00:00:43,581 --> 00:00:47,330
And tonight we're bringing them back on
tape for what I'll ask may be his final

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,100
offering for us. As many of you know,

16
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,750
Dr Sachs recently was diagnosed with liver
cancer and he wrote about this in the

17
00:00:53,751 --> 00:00:58,070
New York Times. He said he plans to spend
the time that he has a left writing,

18
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,380
being with friends, not doing interviews,

19
00:01:00,381 --> 00:01:04,580
but he did agree to share his thoughts
exclusively with us tonight for you

20
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,700
gathered here. Um, cause
he's one of our family.

21
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,100
So as I've done for decades now,

22
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:13,220
I went over to his house in Manhattan
with my mic and I said to him,

23
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,050
I just need to know like what, what
just happened a month and a half ago?

24
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,980
You were fine. And then what? Um,

25
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,800
at the beginning of the year, I
was fine. On the 3rd of January,

26
00:01:27,801 --> 00:01:32,210
I felt a little queer and
I passed some dark urine.

27
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:36,390
I thought had a little
gallbladder attack and, um,

28
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:41,240
didn't pay that much attention, but
thought I better get things checked.

29
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,110
And, um, the extra day,
which was expected, Ooh,

30
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:48,030
need to show a couple of gallstones,

31
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,620
showed hundreds of cysts in my liver.

32
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,850
Uh, although my doctor said
he didn't know what the,

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,140
his one I would need further
tests. I, I knew what they were.

34
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:04,180
I said, it's happened.

35
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,471
And he was right.

36
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:10,880
The doctors eventually confirmed at a
cancer that had been found in his eye nine

37
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:14,000
years ago had spread
to his liver. Where you

38
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:20,550
frightened or relieved or console or what,

39
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,600
what? No, I, um,

40
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:28,660
I think my first feeling was
one of, of overwhelming sadness.

41
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,800
Um, now all sorts of
things I won't see. Um,

42
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:38,820
and I won't do one or two people
have written to me in the, you know,

43
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,550
consoling me and said, well, you
know, we all die, but fuck it.

44
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,780
It's not like we all die. It's
like you have four months.

45
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,780
Has that, has your PR, what is
your prognosis at this moment?

46
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:57,060
Cause I know you had an eye. Oh, well
if it gets revised, it depends on,

47
00:02:57,061 --> 00:03:00,100
of course, on how the
cancer responds to and, or

48
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,700
how quickly it spreads so far. Um,

49
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,440
the metastasis from my eye, uh,

50
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,170
only in my liver I'm told
they love liver. Actually.

51
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:12,890
I love liver as well. And,

52
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,930
and one of the magical things I did was
to go and have liver and onions sued

53
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:22,090
after the doctors and thinking
that liver looks better than mine.

54
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,310
He, this is what he's like,

55
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:26,980
instead of being frightened by
the thing is trying to kill him.

56
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:31,240
He's thinking about loving liver and
liver lovers and looking for connections

57
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:32,680
and wondering. He doesn't stop. He,

58
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,970
he just notices that the case in point a
few months ago, his doctor said to him,

59
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:39,610
we're going to run a line up your liver.

60
00:03:39,611 --> 00:03:43,240
And in effect we're going to try to shave
off a star of some of the cancer cells

61
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:44,080
first on one side,

62
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,330
then on the other to see if we
can give you a little more time.

63
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,010
But they weren't him as the
metasticies die, they um,

64
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:54,280
put out various unpleasant
chemicals that may exhaust you,

65
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:57,910
tax your system badly.
And um, at one point,

66
00:03:57,911 --> 00:03:59,560
shortly after the procedures,

67
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:03,250
I started talking a
little strangely and um,

68
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,790
as I was talking I was also writing, um,

69
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,670
you'll be the first person to see this.

70
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:15,030
So he showed me a notebook and we are
showing it to you in just a moment.

71
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,460
You can see they're sort of writing
there on the left. It's all,

72
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,550
he's writing a book, actually a children's
book about the elementary table.

73
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,270
But as he was writing, if you,
if you look to the next page,

74
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:30,250
if you can see that it gets a little
bit wobbly, the letters and then,

75
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,130
and then there was some
crossing out there. I see.

76
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:39,480
And then while the dramatically the
lighting changes and actually there's,

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,270
there's a large slash
across it and then you,

78
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,510
it seems a little incoherent
at the partners. Okay.

79
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,960
And then it turns the pure scribble
that has delirium and crept up on me.

80
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,800
All this happened over the course of 10
minutes and I see what he's doing here.

81
00:04:56,801 --> 00:05:00,070
He's figuring, okay, I'm
writing at a constant speed.

82
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:04,270
I know pretty much how fast I
write and so I can time this out.

83
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:08,590
I can figure out exactly how long it took
me to slip into delirium and then out

84
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:11,140
of this delirium and he's
doing this very, very sick man.

85
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:15,340
It's science to write it
out in a more medical way.

86
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,400
I think this would form a
lovely illustration you put
in a timeline of delirium

87
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,780
to us coming like that.

88
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,840
Why aren't you more frack like unusual
for any doctor and a man of science?

89
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:32,980
You don't seem to worry at all when
things become incoherent or strange.

90
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,980
You're now showing it to me as
if like, Ooh, how interesting.

91
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,330
I was crazy here for a little bit.

92
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,310
The truth is Oliver is fascinated by
what goes on in the human mind no matter

93
00:05:42,311 --> 00:05:46,240
how strange he gets up there at one
time when he was a young resident in

94
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:48,160
California driving his
bike. And by the way,

95
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:52,390
I should show you what he looked like
back then when he was driving his bike.

96
00:05:52,391 --> 00:05:56,680
This I think is him in New
York, a kind of, you know,

97
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:03,260
in the 60s he was also a champion
weightlifter. They called him Dr Squat.

98
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,720
And in this picture that
you showed you here,

99
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,250
that's him raising 600 pounds
in order to win a trophy.

100
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:11,990
Like this is a that he was a champ. And,

101
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:15,950
and you can see more pictures like these
cause we have signed copies of Oliver's

102
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:19,250
new memoir out for sale in the lobby.
It's pretty good book too, by the way.

103
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,270
So in any case at this time and the 1960s,

104
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,790
in addition to being all muscled out,

105
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:30,470
Oliver was a serious recreational
drug taker. And because he's Oliver,

106
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,430
he was extremely curious about his
highs no matter how weird they were.

107
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:39,380
One time for example, he took 20
pills that he shouldn't have. And then

108
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:43,110
to my surprise, um, uh,

109
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,630
there was a spider on the
wall which said hello.

110
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:51,780
It had a voice like broken crosser
and famous mathematician and it, um,

111
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,350
it asked me a while,

112
00:06:53,351 --> 00:06:58,351
the technical question as to where the
Russell had excluded free eagles paradox

113
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,770
and um,

114
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:04,330
we had this conversation answered
the spider [inaudible] onto this fine

115
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,920
discussed fracas paradox with this
minor. I didn't deed cause you,

116
00:07:07,921 --> 00:07:10,390
you trust your perceptions. Okay.

117
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,690
Many years later when I mentioned
this to an entomologist,

118
00:07:13,691 --> 00:07:18,490
fed up Cornell and the philosophical
spider, he said, yes. He said,

119
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,870
I know the species.

120
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,840
So thinking Oliver's way, taking
it all in, talking spiders,

121
00:07:25,841 --> 00:07:30,841
whatever the generosity of his
curiosity becomes profoundly moving and

122
00:07:31,031 --> 00:07:33,400
transformative when he's
treating his patients.

123
00:07:33,401 --> 00:07:36,970
I want to tell one story here really
quickly to demonstrate what I mean.

124
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:40,630
Oliver once had a patient
whom he called Mrs o c

125
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,440
she was an old woman.

126
00:07:44,441 --> 00:07:48,460
She was 88 years old living in a nursing
home and one night she was awakened,

127
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,920
jarred awake by a loud sound.

128
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,423
Um,

129
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,833
it was a song.

130
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,663
Yeah,

131
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,900
and she thought, well, somebody left
the radio on, but when she looked,

132
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,530
the radio in the room was off,
her roommate sound asleep,

133
00:08:06,531 --> 00:08:11,350
which was odd because the song
was really loud. Good. Doris.

134
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,170
After that, there was another song

135
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:17,180
[inaudible]

136
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:22,070
and then another song is a
home. Mrs [inaudible] thought,

137
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,890
well, maybe my roommate can't hear
the songs because the songs are,

138
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,920
are coming through the fillings in my
teeth. I've heard that it's possible,

139
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,250
but no, her doctors told her,
this is something in your head,

140
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:35,630
you need to see a neurologist,
which led her to Dr Sachs

141
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,780
at when he met Mrs OSI, he,
she could barely hear him.

142
00:08:40,781 --> 00:08:43,480
The song sung by the female
voice were coming and coming.

143
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:46,750
She was frightened and justifiably
worried that she was going crazy.

144
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,110
But Oliver said, no, no, no, I'm going
to do some tests. And when he was done,

145
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,670
he said he'd found a slight stroke or
condition that it triggered musical

146
00:08:54,671 --> 00:08:57,180
epilepsy. These sudden
production of music in her brain.

147
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,750
Now a normal doctor might say,
okay, we've got the diagnosis,

148
00:09:00,751 --> 00:09:03,540
and he thought that the songs would
probably fade and it will pass.

149
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:07,710
So they would be done. But Oliver
did not stop. He doesn't stop

150
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:10,940
[inaudible]

151
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,200
he kept talking to her.

152
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,800
She told him she was born in Ireland in
the 1890s her father died before she was

153
00:09:17,931 --> 00:09:20,300
born. Her mother, when she was only five

154
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,130
often alone,

155
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:26,360
she was sent to America to live
for the welder for beating maison.

156
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:31,850
She had no conscious memory at
the first five years of her life,

157
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,490
no memory of her mother of Ireland.

158
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,940
She had always felt this as
a key and painful sadness,

159
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:42,110
this lack or forgetting of the earliest,
most precious years of her life.

160
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:47,590
So we asked her about the songs, what
are they like? And Mrs [inaudible] said,

161
00:09:47,591 --> 00:09:51,520
well, I think they're lullabies.
Can you sing them for me? She did.

162
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,110
And then after checking with,

163
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,380
I'm not sure who al ever figured out
that these songs were happened to be

164
00:09:56,381 --> 00:10:01,381
popular Irish ballads from the 1890s
when Mrs OSI was a little baby and that

165
00:10:01,991 --> 00:10:05,410
gave him an idea. Now what
he does next isn't science.

166
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,930
It isn't in any traditional way medicine.

167
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,870
He just told her a story
and it goes like this.

168
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,410
You know how nobody remembers anything
that happens to you when you're one or

169
00:10:14,411 --> 00:10:18,220
two or three? Well, there was a
theory once, not honored much today,

170
00:10:18,221 --> 00:10:21,550
but it sad that those earliest
memories get locked away,

171
00:10:21,551 --> 00:10:25,150
deepen our brains in a special
safe that we can never open.

172
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:30,400
So let's suppose Mrs o see that you
are stroked by some crazy chance.

173
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:35,460
Open the lock that none of us can break
and release those first memories in you

174
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:39,550
just for a little while so that
the voice you're listening to

175
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,700
there is a home [inaudible].

176
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:50,260
Maybe that isn't a radio voice. Let's
think that it's your mother's voice.

177
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,850
Pat's your missing mother.

178
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,870
And so at the ripe old age of 88 you
finally get to be back in your mother's

179
00:10:55,871 --> 00:11:00,790
arms. You get to be a baby again, and
Mrs z thought about that and said,

180
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,373
okay,

181
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,180
it sort of fits.

182
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,870
I'm an old woman with a stroke
in an old people's home,

183
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:13,720
but I feel I'm a child to Ireland. The
Gate, I feel my mother's arms. I see her,

184
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,130
I hear her voice seen

185
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:18,150
the green, it clean.

186
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:22,540
Who's Ron? [inaudible].

187
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:27,170
Shortly thereafter, the songs
began to fade. The pauses widened.

188
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:31,790
Mrs OSI had been so frightened by this
music in her head was now sorry to see

189
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:36,560
the songs go, but it was Oliver who
noticed how those songs had touched her.

190
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,550
Who noticed that the songs might become
a comfort to her because that's what he

191
00:11:40,551 --> 00:11:44,630
does. He listens closely. He
can hear another person's heart,

192
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:50,180
and this is really the profound puzzles
for me of Oliver because reading the new

193
00:11:50,181 --> 00:11:50,901
autobiography,

194
00:11:50,901 --> 00:11:55,480
you see that while he was so full of
heart as a doctor in his own life and in

195
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,340
the relationships that really mattered,

196
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:01,630
it turns out he didn't get a whole lot
of affection. He was, for a long time,

197
00:12:01,631 --> 00:12:02,464
a lonely guy.

198
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,480
I'd say he was very lonely and he's
talking about that now for the first time.

199
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,090
Let me, let me talk about
love for a minute. Um,

200
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,110
in this book you tell the story of your,

201
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:17,650
of your very first love a fellow
by the name of Richard Selleck.

202
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,340
Can you just tell me
what happened with him?

203
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,370
Um, yeah. Um,

204
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:28,410
he was a road scholar at Oxford and I'm
a poet and handsome and beautiful beyond

205
00:12:30,431 --> 00:12:35,020
belief and I sort of fell for him. Um,

206
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,300
although I didn't say
anything because I was um, uh,

207
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:44,530
very haunted by my mother's accusations.

208
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,630
What did your mother well,

209
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:52,290
to go a couple of years back
then my father had opened
a conversation that I was

210
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:57,280
about to go to Oxford and have sort of
father son conversation and he said,

211
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:02,570
um, you don't seem to have many
girlfriends. And I said, no,

212
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,940
wishing the conversation
would stop. He said, um,

213
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:10,780
something wrong with girls. And
I said, no, that they're fine.

214
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:16,240
Perhaps you prefer boys. And I
said, well, yes I do. I said,

215
00:13:16,241 --> 00:13:18,820
I've never done anything but I do.

216
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,700
And then you knew that. Then I knew
that. Then I'd known it for six years,

217
00:13:24,701 --> 00:13:28,450
probably since I was 12. Um, and I said,

218
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,540
don't tell mom she will
be able to take it.

219
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:37,410
But my father did tell my mother and
the night and the next morning she came

220
00:13:38,921 --> 00:13:39,850
down with them.

221
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:45,470
I somehow wants to say a face of funder
and raged at me and among other things

222
00:13:46,361 --> 00:13:49,930
said, you're an abomination. I
wish you would never been born.

223
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,330
And then she suddenly shut up
and said nothing for three days.

224
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:59,510
And um, uh,

225
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,190
the matter was never mentioned
again in her lifetime.

226
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:09,450
And then two years later I found myself
for the first time in my life falling in

227
00:14:09,521 --> 00:14:10,250
love.

228
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,940
This was the gun guy, Richard
Oliver at the time was in college.

229
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,070
It was a very positive feeling though.
I didn't know whether it was one,

230
00:14:17,071 --> 00:14:18,690
which I did express,

231
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:22,950
but I did say so with my heart and
my mouth to each other. How about,

232
00:14:22,951 --> 00:14:26,340
did you remember what you said?
I, I said, I'm in love with you.

233
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,920
And Richard gripped me by the
shoulders. And he said, I know.

234
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:36,900
He said, but I'm not that way,
but I love you in my own way.

235
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:41,960
And um, I was glad I had said that I'm
glad that has been received in such a,

236
00:14:41,961 --> 00:14:46,260
a warm, friendly way. I thought we might
be friends for the rest of our lives.

237
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,780
But then one day he came into me,

238
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:53,810
he said he'd been bothered by finding a
in his groin and he was worried could I

239
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:55,670
have a look at it?

240
00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:01,330
And I looked at it and I felt it and it
was hard and tethered and turned out to

241
00:15:02,961 --> 00:15:07,961
be a particularly malignant form of
lymphoid Tema what was called a lympho

242
00:15:08,701 --> 00:15:10,870
sarcoma. And, um,

243
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:14,120
he never spoke to me again after that.

244
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:18,470
I don't know whether since I had been the
first to recognize the ominous import,

245
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,610
I don't know whether he saw me as a
harbinger of death or messenger of death,

246
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:27,640
whatever. But you, you were left
with the, with that silence. Yeah.

247
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:32,240
Yeah. A few years later I'll ever
met an man named Mel. He was young,

248
00:15:32,241 --> 00:15:35,210
he was a sailor. He like Oliver.
He was into weight lifting,

249
00:15:35,211 --> 00:15:38,000
they became close friends and
they began living together.

250
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:43,120
I adored him and was in love with him
and loved physical contact with him and

251
00:15:44,091 --> 00:15:47,960
they'd work out and they'd wrestle and
ride motorcycles kind of tightly and they

252
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:50,720
never talked about what might or
might not be happening between them.

253
00:15:50,721 --> 00:15:55,100
But one day they were together and
outer was giving male a back massage,

254
00:15:55,101 --> 00:15:59,060
which Mel often asked him to
do. And uh, I love to do that.

255
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:03,110
And Oliver says sometimes he'd
get a little, you know, excited.

256
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:08,080
And so long as I gave no explicit
indication, it was okay, but, but,

257
00:16:08,081 --> 00:16:12,470
but one day things went a bit
too far and I got sort of, um,

258
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,040
I went over the brief instead
of just before the Brig. Um,

259
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:21,410
Mel immediately sort of got up
and had a shower and said, I,

260
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,860
I can't stay with you anymore. And um,

261
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:30,010
I found that very cruel and upsetting
and heartbreaking and it made me feel,

262
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,150
I don't want to have
anything to do with people.

263
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:40,580
I must've fallen in love and it
cannot share lives with anyone again.

264
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,480
And he didn't share his life with
anyone for a long, long time.

265
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,700
In fact,

266
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,480
he told me a story about something that
happened to him maybe eight years ago.

267
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:57,940
I was just joining the faculty at Columbia
and I was having a swiffer interview

268
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,100
and a one point the interviewer
said to me, she said,

269
00:17:01,101 --> 00:17:04,700
I have something whether private
to ask you, we do like Ms Edgar,

270
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:09,620
your system to leave. And I said,
no, she's privy to all my affairs.

271
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:14,480
And I then said thinking she was
going to ask me about sex. I said,

272
00:17:14,481 --> 00:17:17,390
I haven't had any sex for 35 years.

273
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,800
I'm in fact what she was going
to ask me, my social security

274
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,390
[inaudible] first it's loft. And she
said, Oh, you poor thing. She said,

275
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,290
we must do something about it. Well,

276
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:36,720
the truth is Oliver didn't do anything
about it because he didn't think he

277
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:40,830
could. I mean, he chosen, Richard
lost, Richard Chosen Mail, lost mail.

278
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,530
It wasn't the point he was
thinking. And then finally,

279
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,440
and who knows when or why
these things happen to people.

280
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:50,370
But a man came along
who for the first chose

281
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,263
Oliver,

282
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:57,550
I have met Billy is I meet a number of
people because I'd been sent a manuscript

283
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:02,900
or proof for book and
intimacy grew between us.

284
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,260
I don't think I quite
realized how deep it was.

285
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:11,290
But then there was a particular episode
in Christmas of Oh nine when he came up

286
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,750
and in a sort of serious way,

287
00:18:17,751 --> 00:18:20,870
he has a serious careful way. He said, I,

288
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,540
I have conceived a deep love for you.

289
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,670
I have conceived a deep
love for you. Yeah. Um,

290
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:32,770
that is a story that's like got a
few extra words I have conceived. Um,

291
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:38,420
okay. Was He scared to
say I love you or um, no,

292
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:42,890
he likes the English language. I think it,

293
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,160
I think it couldn't have been put, um,

294
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,170
more cautiously and yet more strongly.

295
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,320
I think it was a beautiful
way of putting it.

296
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:56,800
And then I realized at that moment with
his saying that that I had conceived a

297
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:02,930
deep love for him and I
am among other things.

298
00:19:02,931 --> 00:19:06,020
I thought good goddess happened again,

299
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,133
two

300
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:15,650
and I'm in my 77th year and um, and,

301
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:21,110
and what next two things, um,

302
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:24,110
basically have gone happily ever since.

303
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:30,510
[inaudible]

304
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:34,500
and supplies in me. Look, Leslie. Um,

305
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,420
because then again, I'm not dealing
with all what I'm dealing with a hoop.

306
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,970
I'm dealing with an individual

307
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:45,070
[inaudible]

308
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,960
I am not dealing with a, um, uh,

309
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,110
a condition defined by medicine or law.

310
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:57,270
So Oliver's still doesn't know how much
time he has left, but for the moment,

311
00:19:57,271 --> 00:20:01,070
as you can hear, his mind is
totally intact. He's still writing.

312
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,570
He has two books in addition to
the one you'll find in the lobby,

313
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,850
B that he's writing and
the children's book,

314
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,750
Bunch of New Yorker stories in the last
few months and a New York review of

315
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:11,910
books story. He's got energy to spare.

316
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:13,950
So I want to do one last
thing before we close.

317
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:17,790
And this comes from yet
another conversation I had
with him. And it's a story.

318
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:21,990
I know Oliver Wood heat because he's
not a capital I religious kind of guy,

319
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:25,680
but he is somebody who
definitely embraces mystery.

320
00:20:25,681 --> 00:20:30,681
And for a long time he's been
mystified by a color called Indigo,

321
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:31,883
indigo,

322
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:37,220
which Newton had inserted
between blue and violent and no,

323
00:20:37,351 --> 00:20:41,130
no two people seem to agree
as to what indigo was like.

324
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:46,350
And so I built up a sort
of chemical launchpad,

325
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,490
meaning he took lot of drugs

326
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,840
[inaudible] base of amphetamine
for general a while.

327
00:20:51,841 --> 00:20:55,360
So then some acid and a little cannabis.

328
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:59,260
And when I was sufficiently
stoned, I said,

329
00:20:59,261 --> 00:21:02,320
I want to see indigo now.

330
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:06,630
[inaudible]

331
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:11,630
as if it were reply and does if phone by
a giant paintbrush that appeared a huge

332
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:14,483
trembling,

333
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:19,820
pear shaped blob of what I instantly
realized was pure indigo on the white wall

334
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,040
in front of me.

335
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It had had a wonderful luminosity
and in particular I am,

336
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:34,080
although I am not a religious person,
I thought this is the color of heaven.

337
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,520
And I lived towards it and I sort of
ecstasy and then suddenly disappeared.

338
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,670
And he says he had one more moment
like that this time. No drugs.

339
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,460
He was in a museum staring
at an Egyptian artifact.

340
00:21:47,461 --> 00:21:51,030
He sees this re in color
back again, just for a beat.

341
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:55,880
I was given five tantalizing
seconds of, of, of radiant,

342
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:57,320
ineffable beauty,

343
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,320
and then again, it vanished.

344
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:04,000
And that was in 1965 and I've
never seen an indigo since.

345
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,650
But who knows? You know,

346
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:11,100
someday I like to think Dr Sachs
may get to see that color again.

347
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:21,970
[inaudible].
