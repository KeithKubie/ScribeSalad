00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.310
INTERVIEWER: The symbolism
of the elaborate iron

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.240
gates in front of Nassau Hall
has evolved over the years.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.180
When FitzRandolph Gate
was installed in 1905,

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.390
the gates beautified
front campus

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.730
but acted as a barrier between
the University and the town.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.910
Opened only for occasional
guests and University events,

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.820
FitzRandolph Gate remained
closed for 65 years

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.580
until 1970, when students
requested that the gates stand

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.140
permanently open as the symbol
of the University's openness

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.410
to the community.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.490
It was then, as students began
celebrating their Commencement

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.760
by marching through the gate
into the postcollegiate world,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.785
that the rumors surrounding 
FitzRandolph Gate started forming.

00:00:39.785 --> 00:00:41.160
CHRISTOPHER L. EISGRUBER: 
I think

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.280
the FitzRandolph myth has
become a very important part

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.166
of student culture.

00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:47.790
As I was walking out
to this interview,

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.490
there was an Orange Key
group assembled right

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.860
on the Nassau Hall
steps, and the guide

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.444
was telling them that if
they walked out the gate,

00:00:55.444 --> 00:00:56.860
they were never
going to graduate.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.010
And I held up my hands and
said, hey, I walked out of it

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.840
all the time when I
was an undergraduate.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.490
It worked out OK.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.980
But I think they probably
believed the guide rather than

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:05.690
me.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.814
ASA CRAIG: Us graduate
students don't necessarily

00:01:07.814 --> 00:01:09.245
know the full story of the myth.

00:01:09.245 --> 00:01:11.620
MARCUS JOHNSON: So I didn't
even know the gate had a name

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.070
until like two weeks ago.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.680
PRISCILLA YEUNG: The myth is
that you cannot walk through

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.350
the main center gate of 
FitzRandolph Gate, otherwise,

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.400
you will not graduate.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.980
But you are allowed to
walk in the center gate,

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.140
and you are allowed to walk
through the side gates.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.700
RYAN STOFFERS: I know there's
a gate that you're not really

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.415
supposed to walk in, because
it'll make you not graduate

00:01:29.415 --> 00:01:31.780
or graduate late, but
I haven't taken it

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.370
too seriously in my time here.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.290
GARRETT BAIRD: This
is one of the things

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.080
that, like, you don't actually
know, because if someone does

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.340
walk through the gate,
and they don't graduate,

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.380
you don't really see
them around, I guess.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.190
SHANNON OSAKA:
Sometimes people say

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.900
that you won't graduate
at all, but I've

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.910
heard you won't graduate
within four years.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:45.830
MONIQUE CLAIBORNE: It's
a Princeton tradition

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.370
that you walk outside of
the big FitzRandolph Gates

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.370
with your entire class
right after Commencement,

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.510
and you can finally officially
leave the orange bubble,

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.970
the bubble was
broken and whatnot,

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.430
but JFK was a little
rebellious and actually walked

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.030
outside of the FitzRandolph
Gates before Commencement.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.847
And because of that,
he got really sick,

00:02:00.847 --> 00:02:03.430
failed all of his classes, was
forced the transfer to Harvard.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.130
And we really want to
graduate from Princeton.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.250
We definitely don't
want to go to Harvard.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.180
So we really tried to wait
until right after Commencement

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.181
to walk outside the gates
with our entire class.

00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:12.930
BERNADO DA SILVA: I
have a few friends who

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.720
in spite of knowing
the myth, they

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.737
refuse to let it stop them
and they just bravely walk

00:02:18.737 --> 00:02:19.820
through the central gates.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:20.820
And they can do that.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.200
They can do that
whatever they want to do,

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.620
but I'm going to stick to it
to what I'm comfortable with

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.360
and use the side gates
until at least June 6th.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.860
EMILY AVERY: When we do
finally walk through the gates,

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.760
that'll be the sign that
we've really made it,

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.840
and that we're moving
on to the next step.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.402
So I'm really excited for it.

00:02:41.402 --> 00:02:42.860
ASA CRAIG: The idea
behind the myth

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.420
is really around a shared,
sort of, sense of community,

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.516
and so if everyone
has this idea of,

00:02:48.516 --> 00:02:50.390
hey, we're going to get
through together, get

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.560
through Princeton, get
through writing our thesis,

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.850
it make sense to really get a
communal understanding of what

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.620
it means to
experience this place

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.000
and to go out into the world.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.840
BERNADO DA SILVA:
My accomplishments

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.580
are definitely in
a way my parents

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.362
and family's accomplishments,
they've given me so much --

00:03:05.362 --> 00:03:07.070
given up so much so
that I can have a lot

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.810
and that I can be
here at Princeton

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.310
and have these
great opportunities.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.184
SAMI WALTER: There's so
many great traditions

00:03:12.184 --> 00:03:15.200
that bring people together
like the thesis experience

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.690
and freshman orientation, etc.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.145
And I can still remember
that first day, the people

00:03:20.145 --> 00:03:22.145
I was sitting with in the
chapel, and the people

00:03:22.145 --> 00:03:23.230
I walked through the gate with.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.410
MARY HELEN DEGOLIAN: I think
one of the things I really

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.050
appreciated about
Princeton is how, like, you

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.000
can't go a day without
learning something new.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.200
SHANNON OSAKA: You're exposed
to so many things all the time.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.325
And you have so many
opportunities to go to a talk,

00:03:33.325 --> 00:03:35.960
to go to a show, to
sit in on a lecture class

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.460
that you're not even taking.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.330
MARY HELEN DEGOLIAN:
Kind of in the abstract,

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.550
my hopes for graduation
are to keep that, like,

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.130
love of learning and that,
like, continual learning even

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.950
in my career.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.370
VIVIAN CHANG: And I think a
lot of us graduate students,

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.286
undergrads, are thinking
about the same things.

00:03:48.286 --> 00:03:49.760
How do I change the world?

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.814
How do I bring my full self
into everything I'm doing?

00:03:52.814 --> 00:03:54.230
MONIQUE CLAIBORNE:
Once you leave,

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.230
you feel like you're not
just part of those four class

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.550
years that have been part
of your experience here,

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.352
but you're actually part of a
many, many years before you,

00:04:01.352 --> 00:04:02.810
and you're still
part of many years

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.010
to come after you as well.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.600
RYAN STOFFERS: I think that
one of the great strengths

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.280
of Princeton, especially
the Woodrow Wilson School

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.510
is the alumni community.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.430
I know they've been
immensely helpful to me

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.050
throughout my time here.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.880
Always willing to answer
questions, have meetings,

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.839
connect me with
people that they know.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:19.772
And so I think that when
I go out through the gate,

00:04:19.772 --> 00:04:21.230
and I'm on the
other side then I'll

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.347
be in that role helping
current students however I can.

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:26.930
And I'm looking forward to when
I get my first current student

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.750
reaching out to me and asking
questions about my career

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.590
or how I can help them,
and I'll be happy to.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.620
COLIN LUALDI: I hope with
my future work in physics

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.580
that I can encourage more
deaf youth to get involved

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.140
in advanced stem research, and
we'll see, maybe one of them

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.816
will win the Nobel Prize.

00:04:46.816 --> 00:04:49.190
MARCUS JOHNSON: So I really
hope that through my research

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.610
and also my work
in the classroom

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.630
that I really continue
to be able to empower

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.530
the next generation of
underrepresented scholars

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.110
in political science
and also to enrich

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.050
the experience of students that
are traditionally represented

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.047
in higher education.

00:05:04.047 --> 00:05:06.380
CHRISTOPHER L. EISGRUBER
You've accomplished a lot here,

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.300
and all of us at Princeton
are excited to see

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.910
what you're going to do in the
world beyond FitzRandolph Gate

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.700
and excited to welcome you
back when you come back

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:14.720
to Princeton University.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.870
