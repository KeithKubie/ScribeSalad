00:00:06.763 --> 00:00:10.609
The annals of Ancient Egyptian king 
Thutmose III

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:13.266
described a marvelous foreign bird that

00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:15.284
“gives birth daily.”

00:00:15.284 --> 00:00:17.422
Zoroastrians viewed them as spirits

00:00:17.422 --> 00:00:20.144
whose cries told of the cosmic struggle

00:00:20.144 --> 00:00:22.746
between darkness and light.

00:00:22.746 --> 00:00:24.936
Romans brought them on
their military campaigns

00:00:24.936 --> 00:00:28.545
to foretell the success of future battles.

00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:31.946
And today, this bird still occupies
an important,

00:00:31.946 --> 00:00:34.476
though much less honorable position

00:00:34.476 --> 00:00:36.585
– on our dinner plates.

00:00:36.585 --> 00:00:41.245
The modern chicken is descended
primarily from the Red Junglefowl,

00:00:41.245 --> 00:00:44.425
and partially from three other 
closely related species,

00:00:44.425 --> 00:00:47.529
all native to India and Southeast Asia.

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:49.445
The region’s bamboo plants produce

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:50.901
massive amounts of fruit

00:00:50.901 --> 00:00:53.646
just once every few decades.

00:00:53.646 --> 00:00:56.211
Junglefowls’ ability to lay eggs daily

00:00:56.211 --> 00:01:00.172
may have evolved to take advantage 
of these rare feasts,

00:01:00.172 --> 00:01:04.275
increasing their population
when food was abundant.

00:01:04.275 --> 00:01:06.336
This was something humans could exploit

00:01:06.336 --> 00:01:07.876
on a consistent basis,

00:01:07.876 --> 00:01:09.833
and the birds’ weak flight capabilities

00:01:09.833 --> 00:01:12.381
and limited need for space made them

00:01:12.381 --> 00:01:15.124
easy to capture and contain.

00:01:15.129 --> 00:01:17.054
The earliest domesticated chickens,

00:01:17.054 --> 00:01:20.332
dating at least back to 7,000 years ago,

00:01:20.332 --> 00:01:22.116
weren’t bred for food,

00:01:22.116 --> 00:01:25.294
but for something considered
less savory today.

00:01:25.294 --> 00:01:27.642
The aggressiveness of breeding males,

00:01:27.642 --> 00:01:29.654
armed with natural leg spurs,

00:01:29.654 --> 00:01:33.280
made cockfighting a popular entertainment.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.162
By the second millennium BCE,

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:38.159
chickens had spread from the 
Indus Valley to China

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.237
and the Middle East to occupy
royal menageries

00:01:41.237 --> 00:01:43.839
and to be used in religious rituals.

00:01:43.839 --> 00:01:45.372
But it was in Egypt

00:01:45.372 --> 00:01:49.215
where the next chapter in
the bird’s history began.

00:01:49.215 --> 00:01:51.671
When a hen naturally incubates eggs,

00:01:51.671 --> 00:01:53.457
she will stop laying new ones

00:01:53.457 --> 00:01:58.234
and sit on a “clutch” of 6
or more eggs for 21 days.

00:01:58.234 --> 00:02:01.002
By the middle of the 1st millennium BCE,

00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:02.556
the Egyptians had learned

00:02:02.556 --> 00:02:04.700
to artificially incubate chicken eggs

00:02:04.702 --> 00:02:08.620
by placing them in baskets over hot ashes.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.903
That freed up hens to continue
laying daily,

00:02:11.903 --> 00:02:14.165
and what had been a royal delicacy

00:02:14.165 --> 00:02:15.784
or religious offering

00:02:15.784 --> 00:02:18.110
became a common meal.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.233
Around the same time as Egyptians
were incubating eggs,

00:02:21.233 --> 00:02:24.442
Phoenician merchants introduced
chickens to Europe,

00:02:24.442 --> 00:02:26.779
where they quickly became
an essential part

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:28.914
of European livestock.

00:02:28.914 --> 00:02:30.901
However, for a long time,

00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:33.812
the chicken’s revered status 
continued to exist

00:02:33.812 --> 00:02:36.264
alongside its culinary one.

00:02:36.264 --> 00:02:38.305
The Ancient Greeks used fighting roosters

00:02:38.305 --> 00:02:41.866
as inspirational examples 
for young soldiers.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.218
The Romans consulted chickens as oracles.

00:02:45.218 --> 00:02:47.281
And as late as the 7th Century,

00:02:47.281 --> 00:02:50.837
the chicken was considered
a symbol for Christianity.

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:52.602
Over the next few centuries,

00:02:52.602 --> 00:02:54.945
chickens accompanied humans
wherever they went,

00:02:54.945 --> 00:02:57.109
spreading throughout the world
through trade,

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:57.991
conquest,

00:02:57.991 --> 00:02:59.844
and colonization.

00:02:59.844 --> 00:03:01.356
After the Opium Wars,

00:03:01.356 --> 00:03:03.560
Chinese breeds were brought to England

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.720
and crossed with local chickens.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.728
This gave rise to a phenomenon called

00:03:07.728 --> 00:03:09.225
“Hen Fever”

00:03:09.225 --> 00:03:10.634
or “The Fancy”,

00:03:10.634 --> 00:03:12.194
with farmers all over Europe

00:03:12.194 --> 00:03:14.311
striving to breed new varieties

00:03:14.311 --> 00:03:17.105
with particular combinations of traits.

00:03:17.105 --> 00:03:19.053
This trend also caught the attention

00:03:19.053 --> 00:03:21.373
of a certain Charles Darwin,
who wondered if

00:03:21.373 --> 00:03:25.291
a similar selective breeding process
occurred in nature.

00:03:25.291 --> 00:03:27.930
Darwin would observe hundreds of chickens

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.147
while finalizing his historic work

00:03:30.147 --> 00:03:33.129
introducing the theory of Evolution.

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.572
But the chicken’s greatest
contribution to science

00:03:35.572 --> 00:03:36.981
was yet to come.

00:03:36.981 --> 00:03:38.609
In the early 20th century,

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.495
a trio of British scientists

00:03:40.495 --> 00:03:43.881
conducted extensive crossbreeding
of chickens,

00:03:43.881 --> 00:03:45.406
building on Gregor Mendel’s

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.928
studies of genetic inheritance.

00:03:47.928 --> 00:03:49.699
With their high genetic diversity,

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:51.170
many distinct traits,

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.776
and only 7 months between generations,

00:03:53.776 --> 00:03:56.462
chickens were the perfect subject.

00:03:56.462 --> 00:03:59.378
This work resulted in the famous
Punnett Square,

00:03:59.378 --> 00:04:02.443
used to show the genotypes
that would result

00:04:02.443 --> 00:04:04.420
from breeding a given pairing.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.465
Since then,

00:04:05.465 --> 00:04:07.781
numerous breeding initiatives
have made chickens

00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:08.947
bigger and meatier,

00:04:08.947 --> 00:04:11.556
and allowed them to lay 
more eggs than ever.

00:04:11.556 --> 00:04:12.413
Meanwhile,

00:04:12.413 --> 00:04:16.163
chicken production has shifted 
to an industrial, factory-like model,

00:04:16.163 --> 00:04:19.141
with birds raised in spaces 
with a footprint

00:04:19.141 --> 00:04:21.857
no larger than a sheet of paper.

00:04:21.857 --> 00:04:24.522
And while there’s been a shift
towards free-range farming

00:04:24.522 --> 00:04:27.324
due to animal rights 
and environmental concerns,

00:04:27.324 --> 00:04:30.606
most of the world’s more than
22 billion chickens today

00:04:30.606 --> 00:04:32.863
are factory farmed.

00:04:32.863 --> 00:04:36.385
From gladiators and gifts to the gods,

00:04:36.385 --> 00:04:38.935
to traveling companions 
and research subjects,

00:04:38.935 --> 00:04:42.120
chickens have played many roles
over the centuries.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.739
And though they may not have come 
before the proverbial egg,

00:04:45.739 --> 00:04:50.305
chickens’ fascinating history tells us 
a great deal about our own.
