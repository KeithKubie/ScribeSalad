00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.070
heylia thank you for asking me about my
day you know what do I do at NASA one of

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080
day you know what do I do at NASA one of
 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.420
day you know what do I do at NASA one of
the things that I love about being a

the things that I love about being a
 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.370
the things that I love about being a
scientist is that I don't really have a

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380
scientist is that I don't really have a
 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.989
scientist is that I don't really have a
typical day I do lots of different

when I was getting my doctorate I mainly

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790
when I was getting my doctorate I mainly
 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.310
when I was getting my doctorate I mainly
use telescopes that were in Australia

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320
use telescopes that were in Australia
 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.370
use telescopes that were in Australia
and South America and also in Arizona

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380
and South America and also in Arizona
 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.080
and South America and also in Arizona
Kitt Peak and I use things like the

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090
Kitt Peak and I use things like the
 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.179
Kitt Peak and I use things like the
Hubble Space Telescope so you know

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189
Hubble Space Telescope so you know
 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:41.889
Hubble Space Telescope so you know
sometimes you're actually traveling

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899
sometimes you're actually traveling
 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:43.810
sometimes you're actually traveling
somewhere to make your own discoveries

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820
somewhere to make your own discoveries
 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.760
somewhere to make your own discoveries
and then going back to your office with

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770
and then going back to your office with
 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.709
and then going back to your office with
your data and working on all of the

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:47.719
your data and working on all of the
 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:49.029
your data and working on all of the
different measurements you took and

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039
different measurements you took and
 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:50.520
different measurements you took and
trying to make discoveries out of that

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530
trying to make discoveries out of that
 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.410
trying to make discoveries out of that
it's also very important for scientists

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420
it's also very important for scientists
 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.209
it's also very important for scientists
to share their discoveries you know if

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219
to share their discoveries you know if
 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:56.620
to share their discoveries you know if
you make a wonderful discovery at a

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630
you make a wonderful discovery at a
 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.539
you make a wonderful discovery at a
telescope but nobody ever hears about it

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549
telescope but nobody ever hears about it
 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.490
telescope but nobody ever hears about it
then that was basically a waste of time

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500
then that was basically a waste of time
 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.980
then that was basically a waste of time
and money for you to do that so we write

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990
and money for you to do that so we write
 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.779
and money for you to do that so we write
about our discoveries in scientific

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789
about our discoveries in scientific
 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.179
about our discoveries in scientific
journals other scientists read them and

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189
journals other scientists read them and
 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:08.920
journals other scientists read them and
then we can collaborate and science

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930
then we can collaborate and science
 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.839
then we can collaborate and science
moves forward because we always work

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849
moves forward because we always work
 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.479
moves forward because we always work
together as a group and nothing in

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489
together as a group and nothing in
 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.430
together as a group and nothing in
science happens individually you're

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440
science happens individually you're
 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.650
science happens individually you're
always working with people so you're

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660
always working with people so you're
 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.199
always working with people so you're
going to meetings you're talking about

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209
going to meetings you're talking about
 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:21.790

in training for a mission and this is
wonderful to watch I've had a chance to

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260
wonderful to watch I've had a chance to
 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.500
wonderful to watch I've had a chance to
watch some of this one of the best ways

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510
watch some of this one of the best ways
 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.660
watch some of this one of the best ways
you can train for working in

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670
you can train for working in
 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.789
you can train for working in
zero-gravity actually floating around in

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799
zero-gravity actually floating around in
 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.610
zero-gravity actually floating around in
space is you train in water because

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620
space is you train in water because
 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.490
space is you train in water because
water allows astronauts to float as if

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500
water allows astronauts to float as if
 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.129
water allows astronauts to float as if
they were weightless and so in Houston

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139
they were weightless and so in Houston
 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:38.949
they were weightless and so in Houston
we have an entire full-sized mock-up of

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959
we have an entire full-sized mock-up of
 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.410
we have an entire full-sized mock-up of
the space station in a giant pool of

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420
the space station in a giant pool of
 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.170
the space station in a giant pool of
water and the astronauts go down in

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180
water and the astronauts go down in
 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.390
water and the astronauts go down in
spacesuits to practice how they're going

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400
spacesuits to practice how they're going
 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.250
spacesuits to practice how they're going
to fix the space station or how they're

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260
to fix the space station or how they're
 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.840
to fix the space station or how they're
going to install a new instrument on the

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850
going to install a new instrument on the
 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.849
going to install a new instrument on the
outside and so you can actually watch

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859
outside and so you can actually watch
 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:53.949
outside and so you can actually watch
them going underwater with a team of

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959
them going underwater with a team of
 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.420
them going underwater with a team of
divers to help them and make sure that

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430
divers to help them and make sure that
 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.220
divers to help them and make sure that
they're safe and practicing what they're

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230
they're safe and practicing what they're
 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.620
they're safe and practicing what they're
going to do in space so there's a

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630
going to do in space so there's a
 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.589
going to do in space so there's a
wonderful range of things to do I mean I
