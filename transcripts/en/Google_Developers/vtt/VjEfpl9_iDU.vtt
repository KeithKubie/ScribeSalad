00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.020
Maps are awesome because
they show us where to go.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.290
But how are your users getting
to their chosen destination?

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.360
I'm Ankur Kotwal, and
I'm going to uncover

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.430
the Maps APIs that can make
this an amazing user experience.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.780
Are you using the
Directions API?

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.820
It's a big revelation, so let
me tell you more about it.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.960
The Directions API
web service provides

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.260
step-by-step
directions from point A

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.540
to point B. Being a web service,
it's protected by an API key

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.180
and thus should not be consumed
directly in your mobile app.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.530
Proxy it via your
server, as shown here.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.600
The Directions API can give you
walking, cycling, and driving

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.460
directions, as you'd
expect, but it can also

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.280
give great public
transport directions.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.300
When guiding users
to a destination,

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.440
it's best to show them
the path on a map.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.080
Polylines are a great
way to show the path,

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.820
but rather than have
the polyline appear,

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.620
it's nicer to
animate it in place.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.489
In this demo, we can
see the path grow,

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.510
providing a clear distinction
about the direction of travel.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.690
So now we're showing users where
to go and how to get there,

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.360
but once they're at
their destination,

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.910
our app's work is not done.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.200
I really wish more
apps would show me

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.780
what my destination looks
like, because often,

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.490
it's not obvious which
shop I need to get to.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.840
In effect, users can be
left feeling lost after they

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.650
get to their destination.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.590
Thankfully, there's
a Maps API for that.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.440
Street View is a
great way to visualize

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.580
the user's destination,
or any address, really.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.100
Adding Street View adds a
real-world visual element

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.165
to your app and provides
meaningful context for users.

00:01:44.165 --> 00:01:45.920
Users will generally
expect that they

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.600
can interact with
the Street View,

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.600
since they're likely to pan
and scan around the location,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.900
so be sure to leave
interactivity in place.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.420
You can add a Street View
panorama into your app

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.550
by including it in your layout.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.140
Give it an initial
location like so.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.610
It's important to
maintain user context.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.820
And thus, the introduction
of a Street View

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.350
should not replace
the map but instead

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.810
slide in to occupy the
part of the screen like so.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.690
Here, we're overlaying
a Street View on the map

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.210
and sliding it in as per the
material design guidelines.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.870
The only change we
need to make to our map

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.300
is to adjust the
padding values such

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.710
that the attributions and
Google logo stay visible

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.610
and your app remains compliant
with the terms of service.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.260
You can reverse the
animation if you

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.180
need to hide the Street View.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.900
So with guided directions
and the addition

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.190
of Street View in
your apps, users

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.150
are given a visual
representation

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.720
of their destination.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.850
They're no longer lost
on their way there.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.120
And now, they're no longer
lost when they get there.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.200

never want to be lost again.
