00:00:00.627 --> 00:00:03.326
- [Voiceover] Let's talk
a little bit in more depth

00:00:03.326 --> 00:00:05.805
about how DNA actually copies itself,

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:06.845
how it actually replicates,

00:00:06.845 --> 00:00:08.123
and we're gonna talk about

00:00:08.123 --> 00:00:11.150
the actual actors in the process.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.166
Now, as I talk about
it, I'm gonna talk a lot

00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:17.704
about the 3' and 5' ends
of the DNA molecule,

00:00:17.704 --> 00:00:20.013
and if that is completely
unfamiliar to you,

00:00:20.013 --> 00:00:22.163
I encourage you to watch the video

00:00:22.163 --> 00:00:26.041
on the antiparallel structure of DNA.

00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:28.163
And I'll give a little bit
of a quick review here,

00:00:28.163 --> 00:00:31.355
just in case you saw it but
it was a little while ago.

00:00:31.355 --> 00:00:33.042
This is a zoom-in of DNA,

00:00:33.042 --> 00:00:35.497
it's actually the zoom-in from that video,

00:00:35.497 --> 00:00:37.934
and when we talk about the 5' and 3' ends,

00:00:37.934 --> 00:00:40.848
we're referring to what's
happening on the riboses

00:00:40.848 --> 00:00:44.930
that formed part of this
phosphate sugar backbone.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.051
So we have ribose right over here,

00:00:47.051 --> 00:00:48.639
five-carbon sugar,

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:50.900
and we can number the carbons;

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.876
this is the 1' carbon,
that's the 2' carbon,

00:00:54.876 --> 00:00:58.516
that's the 3' carbon,
that's the 4' carbon,

00:00:58.516 --> 00:01:00.641
and that's the 5' carbon.

00:01:00.641 --> 00:01:02.891
So this side of the ladder,

00:01:04.641 --> 00:01:05.693
you could say,

00:01:05.693 --> 00:01:07.642
it is going in the ...

00:01:07.642 --> 00:01:10.526
it is going, let me
draw a little line here,

00:01:10.526 --> 00:01:13.859
this is going in the 3' to 5' direction.

00:01:15.308 --> 00:01:19.498
So this end is 3' and then this end is 5'.

00:01:19.498 --> 00:01:20.886
It's going 3' to 5'.

00:01:20.886 --> 00:01:23.550
Notice three, this phosphate
connects to the 3',

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.934
then we go to the 5'
connects to a phosphate,

00:01:25.934 --> 00:01:27.358
this connects to a 3',

00:01:27.358 --> 00:01:28.464
then it connects--

00:01:28.464 --> 00:01:31.463
then we go to the 5'
connects to a phosphate.

00:01:31.463 --> 00:01:34.003
Now on this end, as we
said it's antiparallel.

00:01:34.003 --> 00:01:36.676
It's parallel, but it's
oriented the other way.

00:01:36.676 --> 00:01:39.509
So this is the 3', this is the 5',

00:01:40.379 --> 00:01:43.515
this is the 3', this is the 5'.

00:01:43.515 --> 00:01:44.979
And so this is just
what we're talking about

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.563
when we talk about the
antiparallel structure.

00:01:47.563 --> 00:01:49.418
These two backbones,

00:01:49.418 --> 00:01:51.449
these two strands are
parallel to each other,

00:01:51.449 --> 00:01:54.661
but they're oriented
in opposite directions.

00:01:54.661 --> 00:01:58.833
So this is the 3' end
and this is the 5' end.

00:01:58.833 --> 00:02:00.402
And this is gonna be really important

00:02:00.402 --> 00:02:02.070
for understanding replication,

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.030
because the DNA polymerase,

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.767
the things that's adding
more and more nucleotides

00:02:06.767 --> 00:02:09.327
to grow a DNA strand;

00:02:09.327 --> 00:02:12.827
it can only add nucleotides on the 3' end.

00:02:13.872 --> 00:02:16.828
So if we were talking
about this right over here,

00:02:16.828 --> 00:02:18.456
we would only be able to add …

00:02:18.456 --> 00:02:21.741
We would only be able
to add going that way.

00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:24.250
We wouldn't be able to add going …

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.000
We wouldn't be able to add going that way.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.386
So one way to think about it
is you can only add nucleotides

00:02:29.386 --> 00:02:33.074
on the 3' end or you can only extend …

00:02:33.074 --> 00:02:36.741
You can only extend DNA
going from 5' to 3'.

00:02:38.793 --> 00:02:40.978
If you're only adding on the 3' end,

00:02:40.978 --> 00:02:45.038
then you're going from the
5' to the 3' direction.

00:02:45.038 --> 00:02:47.733
You can't go from the
3' to the 5' direction.

00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:52.410
You can't continue to add on
the 5' side using polymerase.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.146
So what am I talking
about with polymerase.

00:02:55.146 --> 00:02:57.046
Well let's look at this
diagram right over here

00:02:57.046 --> 00:02:58.985
that really gives us an overview

00:02:58.985 --> 00:03:01.023
of all of the different actors.

00:03:01.023 --> 00:03:03.512
So here is just our of our DNA strand,

00:03:03.512 --> 00:03:07.270
and it's, you can imagine
it's somewhat natural,

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.769
in it's natural unreplicated form,

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.591
and you could see we've labeled
here the 3' and the 5' ends,

00:03:13.591 --> 00:03:15.436
and you could follow
one of these backbones.

00:03:15.436 --> 00:03:19.204
This 3', if you follow
it all the way over here,

00:03:19.204 --> 00:03:22.914
it goes, this is the corresponding 5' end.

00:03:22.914 --> 00:03:26.741
So this and this are the same strand,

00:03:26.741 --> 00:03:30.402
and this one, if you follow it along,

00:03:30.402 --> 00:03:32.409
if you go all the way over
here, it's the same strand.

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:33.654
So this is the 3' end,

00:03:33.654 --> 00:03:37.821
and 3' end of it and then
this is the 5' end of it.

00:03:38.954 --> 00:03:40.118
Now the first thing,

00:03:40.118 --> 00:03:41.795
and we've talked about
this in previous videos

00:03:41.795 --> 00:03:44.154
where we give an overview of replication,

00:03:44.154 --> 00:03:48.321
is the general idea is that
the two sides of our helix,

00:03:49.992 --> 00:03:54.031
the two DNA, the double-helix
needs to get split,

00:03:54.031 --> 00:03:56.271
and then we can build another,

00:03:56.271 --> 00:03:58.757
we can build another side of the ladder

00:03:58.757 --> 00:04:01.076
on each of those two split ends.

00:04:01.076 --> 00:04:04.092
You could really view this
as if this is a zipper,

00:04:04.092 --> 00:04:08.299
you unzip it and then you put
new zippers on either end.

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.041
But there's a lot of--

00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:12.419
in reality, it is far more
complex than just saying

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.300
"Oh, let's open the zipper
and put new zippers on it."

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.296
It involves a whole bunch of
enzymes and all sorts of things

00:04:18.296 --> 00:04:20.151
and even in this diagram,

00:04:20.151 --> 00:04:21.845
we're not showing all
of the different actors,

00:04:21.845 --> 00:04:24.000
but we're showing you the primary actors,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.459
at least the ones that
you'll hear discussed

00:04:26.459 --> 00:04:30.249
when people talk about DNA replication.

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:31.576
So the first thing that needs to happen,

00:04:31.576 --> 00:04:35.484
right over here, it's all
tightly, tightly wound.

00:04:35.484 --> 00:04:36.445
So let me write that,

00:04:36.445 --> 00:04:38.862
it is tightly, tightly wound.

00:04:40.302 --> 00:04:41.443
And it actually turns out,

00:04:41.443 --> 00:04:44.052
the more that we unwind it on one side,

00:04:44.052 --> 00:04:46.421
the more tightly wound
it gets on this side.

00:04:46.421 --> 00:04:48.903
So in order for us to unzip the zipper,

00:04:48.903 --> 00:04:50.584
we need to have an enzyme

00:04:50.584 --> 00:04:54.861
that helps us unwind
this tightly wound helix.

00:04:54.861 --> 00:04:58.676
And that enzyme is the topoisomerase.

00:04:58.676 --> 00:05:00.993
And the way that it actually works is

00:05:00.993 --> 00:05:04.776
it breaks up parts of the
back bones temporarily,

00:05:04.776 --> 00:05:07.982
so that it can unwind and
then they get back together,

00:05:07.982 --> 00:05:11.097
but the general high-level
idea is it unwinds it,

00:05:11.097 --> 00:05:12.762
so then the helicase enzyme,

00:05:12.762 --> 00:05:14.044
and the helicase really doesn't look like

00:05:14.044 --> 00:05:16.351
this little triangle
that's cutting things.

00:05:16.351 --> 00:05:18.057
These things are actually
far more fascinating

00:05:18.057 --> 00:05:19.427
if you were to actually see a--

00:05:19.427 --> 00:05:21.659
the molecular structure of helicase.

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:23.437
But what helicase is doing

00:05:23.437 --> 00:05:26.874
is it's breaking those
hydrogen bonds between our …

00:05:26.874 --> 00:05:29.156
Between our nitrogenous bases,

00:05:29.156 --> 00:05:31.550
in this case it's an adenine
here, this is a thymine

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.514
and it would break that
hydrogen bond between these two.

00:05:35.514 --> 00:05:37.514
So, first you unwind it,

00:05:39.511 --> 00:05:40.841
then the helicase,

00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:42.831
the topoisomerase unwinds it,

00:05:42.831 --> 00:05:45.555
then the helicase breaks them up,

00:05:45.555 --> 00:05:47.504
and then we actually think about

00:05:47.504 --> 00:05:49.744
these two strands differently,

00:05:49.744 --> 00:05:51.109
because as I mentioned,

00:05:51.109 --> 00:05:53.633
you can only add nucleotides

00:05:53.633 --> 00:05:56.466
going from the 5' to 3' direction.

00:05:57.693 --> 00:05:59.864
So this strand on the
bottom right over here

00:05:59.864 --> 00:06:02.399
which we will call our leading strand,

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:04.236
this one actually has a
pretty straightforward,

00:06:04.236 --> 00:06:06.428
remember this is the
5' end right over here,

00:06:06.428 --> 00:06:07.829
so it can add,

00:06:07.829 --> 00:06:10.349
it can add going in that direction,

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:13.527
it can add going in that
direction right over here.

00:06:13.527 --> 00:06:15.277
This is the 5' to 3',

00:06:16.496 --> 00:06:20.116
so what needs to happen here
is to start the process,

00:06:20.116 --> 00:06:21.949
you need an RNA primer

00:06:22.818 --> 00:06:26.234
and the character that puts an RNA primer,

00:06:26.234 --> 00:06:28.107
that is DNA primase.

00:06:28.107 --> 00:06:29.684
We'll talk a little bit more about

00:06:29.684 --> 00:06:31.967
these characters up here
in the lagging strand,

00:06:31.967 --> 00:06:33.328
but they'll add an RNA,

00:06:33.328 --> 00:06:35.650
let me do this in a color you can see,

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.768
an RNA primer will be added here,

00:06:37.768 --> 00:06:39.598
and then once there's a primer,

00:06:39.598 --> 00:06:44.239
then DNA polymerase can just
start adding nucleotides,

00:06:44.239 --> 00:06:47.159
it can start adding
nucleotides at the 3' end.

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:49.430
And the reason why the leading
strand has it pretty easy

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.680
is this DNA polymerase right over here,

00:06:53.613 --> 00:06:55.692
this polymerase, and once again,

00:06:55.692 --> 00:06:59.107
they aren't these perfect
rectangles as on this diagram.

00:06:59.107 --> 00:07:01.326
They're actually much more
fascinating than that.

00:07:01.326 --> 00:07:02.712
You see the polymerase up there,

00:07:02.712 --> 00:07:07.079
you also see you one
over here, polymerase.

00:07:07.079 --> 00:07:08.477
This polymerase can just,

00:07:08.477 --> 00:07:11.601
you can kind of think of it
as following the opened zipper

00:07:11.601 --> 00:07:13.473
and then just keep adding,

00:07:13.473 --> 00:07:17.191
keep adding nucleotides at the 3' end.

00:07:17.191 --> 00:07:20.831
And so this one seems
pretty straightforward.

00:07:20.831 --> 00:07:23.232
Now, you might say wouldn't it be easy

00:07:23.232 --> 00:07:26.893
if we could just add
nucleotides at a 5' end,

00:07:26.893 --> 00:07:28.433
because then we could say

00:07:28.433 --> 00:07:31.128
well this is going from 3' to 5',

00:07:31.128 --> 00:07:33.399
well maybe that polymerase
or different polymerase

00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:35.563
could just keep adding
nucleotides like that,

00:07:35.563 --> 00:07:37.308
and then everything would be easy.

00:07:37.308 --> 00:07:40.011
Well, it turns out that
that is not the case.

00:07:40.011 --> 00:07:43.841
you cannot add nucleotides at the 5' end,

00:07:43.841 --> 00:07:46.620
and let me be clear,
this 3' right over here,

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.401
this, I'm talking about this strand.

00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:50.295
This strand right over here,

00:07:50.295 --> 00:07:52.332
this, let me do this in another color,

00:07:52.332 --> 00:07:55.454
this strand right over here,

00:07:55.454 --> 00:07:58.856
this is the 3' end, this is the 5' end,

00:07:58.856 --> 00:07:59.689
and so you can't,

00:07:59.689 --> 00:08:03.343
you can't just keep adding
nucleotides just like that,

00:08:03.343 --> 00:08:06.343
and so how does biology handle this?

00:08:07.439 --> 00:08:10.659
Well it handles this by adding primers

00:08:10.659 --> 00:08:14.278
right as this opening
happens, it'll add primers,

00:08:14.278 --> 00:08:17.197
and this diagram shows the
primer is just one nucleotide

00:08:17.197 --> 00:08:19.570
but a primer is typically
several nucleotides,

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:21.467
roughly 10 nucleotides.

00:08:21.467 --> 00:08:25.634
So it'll add roughly 10 RNA
nucleotides right over here,

00:08:27.151 --> 00:08:29.060
and that's done by the DNA primase.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.415
So the DNA primase is
going along the lagging,

00:08:32.415 --> 00:08:36.800
is going along this side,
I can say the top strand,

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.382
and it's adding,

00:08:38.382 --> 00:08:41.280
it's adding the RNA primer,

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.773
which won't be just one nucleotide,

00:08:42.773 --> 00:08:45.186
it tends to be several of them,

00:08:45.186 --> 00:08:48.008
and then once you have that RNA primer,

00:08:48.008 --> 00:08:52.175
then the polymerase can add
in the 5' to 3' direction,

00:08:53.349 --> 00:08:55.432
it can add on the 3' end.

00:08:56.408 --> 00:08:58.606
So then it can just start adding,

00:08:58.606 --> 00:09:00.918
it can just start adding DNA like that.

00:09:00.918 --> 00:09:02.286
And so you can imagine this process,

00:09:02.286 --> 00:09:06.766
it's kind of, you add the
primase, put some primer here,

00:09:06.766 --> 00:09:10.933
and then you start building
from the 5' to 3' direction.

00:09:12.465 --> 00:09:14.684
You start building just like that,

00:09:14.684 --> 00:09:16.818
and then you skip a little bit
and then that happens again.

00:09:16.818 --> 00:09:20.665
So you end up with all
these fragments of DNA

00:09:20.665 --> 00:09:24.492
and those fragments are
called Okazaki fragments.

00:09:24.492 --> 00:09:26.909
So, it's a Okazaki fragments,

00:09:28.251 --> 00:09:30.750
and so what you have happening
here on the lagging strand,

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:31.621
you can think of it as,

00:09:31.621 --> 00:09:32.705
why is it called the lagging strand?

00:09:32.705 --> 00:09:34.996
Well you have to do it in this kind of …

00:09:34.996 --> 00:09:36.555
it feels like a sub-optimal way

00:09:36.555 --> 00:09:39.020
where you have to keep creating
these Okazaki fragments

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.337
as you follow this opening,

00:09:41.337 --> 00:09:45.600
and so it lags, it's going
to be a slower process,

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.074
but then all of these
strands can be put together

00:09:49.074 --> 00:09:50.824
using the DNA ligase.

00:09:52.195 --> 00:09:55.927
The DNA ligase; not only will
the strands be put together,

00:09:55.927 --> 00:09:59.148
but then you also have the
RNA being actually replaced

00:09:59.148 --> 00:10:02.102
with DNA and then when all is said done,

00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:05.623
you are going to have a strand
of DNA being replicated,

00:10:05.623 --> 00:10:08.293
or being created right up here.

00:10:08.293 --> 00:10:10.995
So when it's all done, you're
gonna have two double strands,

00:10:10.995 --> 00:10:12.904
one up here for on the lagging strand,

00:10:12.904 --> 00:10:16.321
and one down here on the leading strand.
