00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:04.589
Canada and the United States share the longest,
straightest, possibly boringest border in

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.540
the world. But, look closer, and there's plenty
of bizarreness to be found.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.130
While these sister nations get along fairly
well, they both want to make it really clear

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.349
whose side of the continent is whose. And
they've done this by carving a 20-foot wide

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:21.349
space along the border. All five and a half
thousand miles of it.

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.770
With the exception of the rare New England
town that predates national borders or the

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.020
odd airport that needed extending, this space
is the no-touching-zone between the countries

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.660
and they're super serious about keeping it
clear. It matters not if the no-touching-zone

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.220
runs through hundreds of miles of virtually
uninhabited Alaskan / Yukon wilderness. Those

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.370
border trees, will not stand.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.470
Which might make you think this must be the
longest, straightest deforested place in the

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.500
world, but it isn't. Deforested: yes, but
straight? Not at all.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.340
Sure it looks straight and on a map, and the
treaties establishing the line *say* it's

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.980
straight... but in the real world the official
border is 900 lines that zig-zags from the

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.020
horizontal by as much as several hundred feet.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.920
How did this happen? Well, imagine you're
back in North America in the 1800s -- The

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.070
49th parallel (one of those horizontal lines
you see on a globe) has just been set as the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.450
national boundary and it's your job to make
it real. You're handed a compass and a ball

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.580
of string and told to carefully mark off the
next 2/3rds of a continent. Don't mind that

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.560
uncharted wilderness in the way: just keep
the line straight.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.990
Yeah.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.860
Good luck.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:22.460
With that.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.640
The men who surveyed the land did the best
they could and built over 900 monuments. They're

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.770
in about as straight as you could expect a
pre-GPS civilization to make, but it's not

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.780
the kind of spherical / planar intersection
that would bring a mathematician joy.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.159
Nonetheless these monuments define the border
and the no-touching-zone plays connect-the-dots

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:39.920
with them.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.560
Oh, and while there are about 900 markers
along this section of the border, there are

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.689
about 8,000 in total that define the shape
of the nations.

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.090
Despite this massive project Canada and the
United States still have disputed territory.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.080
There is a series of islands in the Atlantic
that the United States claims are part of

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.710
Maine and Canada claims are part of New Brunswick.
Canada, assuming the islands are hers built

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.570
a lighthouse on one of them, and the United
States, assuming the islands are hers pretends

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.450
the lighthouse doesn't exist.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.519
It's not a huge problem as the argument is
mostly over tourists who want to see puffins

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.319
and fishermen who want to catch lobsters,
but let's hope the disagreement gets resolved

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.049
before someone finds oil under that lighthouse.

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.930
Even the non-disputed territory has a few
notably weird spots: such as this tick of

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.590
the border upward into Canada. Zoom in and
it gets stranger as the border isn't over

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.650
solid land but runs through a lake to cut
off a bit of Canada before diving back down

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.709
to the US.

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.790
This spot is home to about 100 Americans and
is a perfect example of how border irregularities

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:34.609
are born:

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:38.819
Back in 1783 when the victorious Americans
were negotiating with the British who controlled

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.819
what would one day be Canada, they needed
a map, and this map was the best available

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.859
at the time. While the East Coast looks pretty
good, the wester it goes the sparser it gets.

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:52.959
Under negotiation was the edge of what would
one day be Minnesota and Manitoba. But unfortunately,

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.900
that area was hidden underneath an inset on
the map, so the Americans and British were

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.680
bordering blind. Seriously.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.409
They guessed that the border should start
from the northwestern part of this lake and

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:07.510
go in a horizontal line until it crossed the
Mississippi... somewhere.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.760
But somewhere, turned out to be nowhere as
the mighty Mississippi stops short of that

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.139
line, which left the border vague until 35
years later when a second round of negotiations

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:18.980
established the aforementioned 49th parallel.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.129
But there was still a problem as the lake
mentioned earlier was both higher, and less

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.939
circular than first though, putting its northwesterly
point here so the existing border had to jump

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:31.159
up to meet it and then drop straight down
to the 49th, awkwardly cutting off a bit of

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:34.290
Canada, before heading west across the remainder
of the continent.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.109
Turns out you just can't draw a straight(-ish)
line for hundreds of miles without causing

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:39.699
a few more problems.

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:43.809
One of which was luckily spotted in advance:
Vancouver Island, which the 49th would have

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:47.839
sliced through, but both sides agreed that
would be dumb so the border swoops around

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:48.579
the island.

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.709
However, next door to Vancouver Island is
Point Roberts which went unnoticed as so today

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.389
the border blithey cuts across. It's a nice
little town, home to over 1,000 Americans,

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:01.609
but has only a primary school so its older
kids have to cross international borders four

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.979
times a day to go to school in their own state.

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:08.299
In a pleasing symetry, the East cost has the
exact opposite situation with a Canadian Island

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.279
whose only land route is a bridge to the United
States.

00:04:11.279 --> 00:04:15.099
And these two aren't the only places where
each country contains a bit of the other:

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.310
there are several more, easily spotted in
sattelite photos by the no-touching zone.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.750
Regardless of if the land in question is just
an uninhabited strip, in the middle of a lake,

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:30.750
in the middle of nowhere, the border between
these sister nations must remain clearly marked.
