 [Music] 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:21.570
 how 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:23.310
 [Music] 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.880
 I think with these urban murals 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.840
 we have also achieved that young people 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:34.050
 I turned to see his grandparents because we have 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.690
 shown that they are also important 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.850
 for our community and they give me 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.550
 gives the impression that if there has been more 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.199
 interest on the part of young people is 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.170
 sit down to talk with their grandparents and 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.299
 know its history 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.299
 [Music] 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:54.470
 or 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.930
 usually they are people who are not 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.990
 taken into account that's why we've decided 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.330
 turn to see those people who 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.790
 another way hardly anyone is going to 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:13.760
 honor 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:13.760
 [Music] 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.470
 people know the characters to 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.870
 difference from other characters maybe 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.180
 historical where people see them but 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.760
 these characters see them very far 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.170
 locals, people appropriate them because 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.050
 it's the neighbor because it's the grandma 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.000
 because it's aunt 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.860
 and that has been very positive for our 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.430
 community people feel very 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.430
 proud 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.000
 ah 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.489
 [Music] 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.200
 ah 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:13.180
 It has cost a lot a lot, I liked it because 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:16.730
 to portray me they took me out better is very 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.989
 nice because I thought that I 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.989
 God gives you 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:30.059
