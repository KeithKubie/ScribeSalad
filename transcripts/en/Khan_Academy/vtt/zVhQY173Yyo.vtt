00:00:01.064 --> 00:00:02.064
- [Voiceover] What number is shown

00:00:02.064 --> 00:00:03.907
by the place value blocks?

00:00:03.907 --> 00:00:06.836
So here we have several
sets of place value blocks,

00:00:06.836 --> 00:00:08.643
some with many many many blocks

00:00:08.643 --> 00:00:10.179
and some with just single blocks

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:13.337
stacked on top of each
other, and we want to know

00:00:13.337 --> 00:00:17.504
what number is represented bay
all of the blocks combined.

00:00:18.597 --> 00:00:20.663
So let's start over here
with the single blocks

00:00:20.663 --> 00:00:22.378
stacked on top of each other because

00:00:22.378 --> 00:00:24.912
it will be the easiest one to count.

00:00:24.912 --> 00:00:26.661
We can zoom in on that a little bit,

00:00:26.661 --> 00:00:30.006
make it easier for us to count,

00:00:30.006 --> 00:00:31.702
and these are just single blocks, ones,

00:00:31.702 --> 00:00:35.869
stacked on top of each
other, so we can count them,

00:00:36.854 --> 00:00:39.971
and we'll see there's one,
two, three, four, five,

00:00:39.971 --> 00:00:42.554
six, seven, eight, nine blocks.

00:00:44.707 --> 00:00:47.932
Nine blocks right here, then moving over,

00:00:47.932 --> 00:00:51.893
now we have columns of ones,
and each of these columns,

00:00:51.893 --> 00:00:56.770
here's nine because nine is
even with this other nine column

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.067
plus one more is 10, so
each of these columns

00:01:00.067 --> 00:01:02.567
has 10 blocks, these are tens.

00:01:04.441 --> 00:01:07.126
How many tens do we
have, we have one, two,

00:01:07.126 --> 00:01:10.166
three, four, five, five sets of 10,

00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:13.249
or 50, so we have 50 blocks here plus

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.051
nine more in that last column.

00:01:18.051 --> 00:01:22.486
Moving over, now we have
these columns of 10,

00:01:22.486 --> 00:01:24.982
but it's several columns
of 10 stuck together

00:01:24.982 --> 00:01:28.117
to make sort of like a slab.

00:01:28.117 --> 00:01:30.563
How many columns of 10 are in this slab?

00:01:30.563 --> 00:01:33.980
There's one, two, three, four, five, six,

00:01:35.362 --> 00:01:38.362
seven, eight, nine 10 columns of 10.

00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:43.638
10 rows of 10 or 10 columns of 10,

00:01:43.638 --> 00:01:47.805
which is a total of 100, so
each of these slabs is 100,

00:01:48.677 --> 00:01:50.872
and how many slabs do we have?

00:01:50.872 --> 00:01:55.606
We have one, and then two,
a second one back there.

00:01:55.606 --> 00:01:58.273
So we have two hundreds, or 200,

00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:05.984
and then finally, scooching
it over a little bit,

00:02:05.984 --> 00:02:08.332
here we have these slabs of 100,

00:02:08.332 --> 00:02:11.364
these sets of 100, all stacked together,

00:02:11.364 --> 00:02:13.704
so there's one set of 100 here,

00:02:13.704 --> 00:02:17.367
then another set behind
it, and another, and so on.

00:02:17.367 --> 00:02:19.120
So let's count how many hundreds this is.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.287
We have 100, 200, 300, 400,
500, 600, 700, 800, 900,

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:30.264
and that last one makes it 1,000,

00:02:31.381 --> 00:02:35.548
so these are thousands, and
how many thousands are there?

00:02:37.382 --> 00:02:39.799
There are one, two, so 2,000.

00:02:45.343 --> 00:02:49.010
Two thousands, zooming
back out, we can look

00:02:52.622 --> 00:02:54.437
at all of the amounts we had.

00:02:54.437 --> 00:02:57.099
We had 2,000 blocks plus 200 more blocks

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.971
plus 50 more blocks plus nine blocks,

00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:03.721
or in total we have 2,259 blocks.

00:03:12.735 --> 00:03:14.461
Moving on to this next one, we know

00:03:14.461 --> 00:03:17.363
what these different sizes represent.

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:20.363
Here this column at the end is ones.

00:03:21.684 --> 00:03:25.101
Right beside it, these are columns of 10.

00:03:26.144 --> 00:03:28.816
We know those are tens, then we don't have

00:03:28.816 --> 00:03:31.858
any of the hundreds,
any of the where we had

00:03:31.858 --> 00:03:34.804
10 sets of 10 making
sort of like a flat slab,

00:03:34.804 --> 00:03:37.493
we don't have any hundreds in this number,

00:03:37.493 --> 00:03:39.701
but we do have these large cubes

00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:42.595
made up of many many many small cubes,

00:03:42.595 --> 00:03:46.762
and those are thousands, because
they were 10 sets of 100.

00:03:48.375 --> 00:03:51.721
So now let's count, we
have one, two, three, four,

00:03:51.721 --> 00:03:55.888
five, six, seven, eight, ones,
which is the same as eight,

00:03:57.267 --> 00:03:59.767
plus one, two, three tens, 30,

00:04:02.935 --> 00:04:06.018
plus no hundreds again, but one, two,

00:04:09.577 --> 00:04:12.244
three thousands, which is 3,000.

00:04:15.777 --> 00:04:17.215
So when we combine these numbers,

00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:20.836
we need to be careful to
remember there are no hundreds.

00:04:20.836 --> 00:04:25.003
Our number will be three
thousand, zero hundreds, and 38.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.167
3,038 is the number represented
by these place value blocks.

00:04:36.685 --> 00:04:38.486
For this one, I encourage
you to pause the video

00:04:38.486 --> 00:04:40.329
and see if you can figure out on your own

00:04:40.329 --> 00:04:44.496
what number is represented
by the place value blocks.

00:04:46.183 --> 00:04:47.635
And now we can look at it together.

00:04:47.635 --> 00:04:51.802
Let's remember, this is ones,
tens, hundreds, and thousands.

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:01.296
So looking at our ones, we have
one, two, three, four ones.

00:05:02.727 --> 00:05:06.227
Four ones plus one, two tens, which is 20,

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.354
10 plus 10 is 20, plus now these hundreds.

00:05:11.354 --> 00:05:13.593
There's several hundreds, let's see,

00:05:13.593 --> 00:05:17.343
100, 200, 300, 400, 500,
600, seven hundreds.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.976
There's seven of the hundreds plus

00:05:21.976 --> 00:05:25.893
only one of the thousands,
which will be 1,000.

00:05:27.896 --> 00:05:29.860
And now to combine this,
to write this all together,

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.027
this will be 1,724 is the number shown

00:05:37.321 --> 00:05:39.031
with these place value blocks.
