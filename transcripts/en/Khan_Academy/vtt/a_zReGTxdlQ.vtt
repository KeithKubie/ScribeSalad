00:00:00.278 --> 00:00:01.699
- [Voiceover] Now, I'd like to demonstrate

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:03.773
one way to construct a sine wave.

00:00:03.773 --> 00:00:05.791
What we're gonna do is
we're gonna construct

00:00:05.791 --> 00:00:09.353
something that looks like sine of omega t.

00:00:09.353 --> 00:00:13.239
So, we have our function of time here.

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:15.489
And, we have our frequency.

00:00:19.843 --> 00:00:21.652
Now, this little animation
is gonna show us a way

00:00:21.652 --> 00:00:23.133
to construct a sine wave.

00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.728
So, what I have here, this green line

00:00:24.728 --> 00:00:26.818
is a rotating vector.

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:30.601
And, let's just say that the
radius of this circle is one.

00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:34.379
So, here's a vector just rotating
slowly around and around.

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:36.971
And, in the dotted line
here and that yellow dot

00:00:36.971 --> 00:00:40.709
going up and down, that's the projection.

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:43.997
That's the projection of
the tip of the green arrow

00:00:43.997 --> 00:00:45.330
onto the y axis.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.954
And, as the vector goes around and around,

00:00:55.954 --> 00:00:58.770
you could see that the
projection on the y axis

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.367
is bobbing up and down and up and down.

00:01:01.367 --> 00:01:02.812
And, that's actually going up and down

00:01:02.812 --> 00:01:04.275
in a sine wave pattern.

00:01:04.275 --> 00:01:06.375
So, now I'm gonna switch
to a new animation

00:01:06.375 --> 00:01:08.501
and we'll see what that dot looks like

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:11.084
as it goes up and down in time.

00:01:15.552 --> 00:01:16.542
So, here's the plot.

00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:18.691
Here's what a sine wave looks like.

00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:20.980
As you notice, when the
green line goes through zero

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.224
right there, let's wait
'til it comes around again,

00:01:23.224 --> 00:01:26.321
the value of the yellow line
when it goes through zero

00:01:26.321 --> 00:01:27.154
is zero.

00:01:29.203 --> 00:01:33.370
So, this yellow line here is
a plot of sine of omega t.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.581
Now, if I go to a projection,

00:01:38.581 --> 00:01:40.504
this projection was onto the y axis,

00:01:40.504 --> 00:01:42.455
and I can do the same
animation but this time

00:01:42.455 --> 00:01:44.522
project onto the x axis.

00:01:44.522 --> 00:01:46.810
And, that will produce
for us a cosine wave.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.393
Let's see what that looks like.

00:01:59.993 --> 00:02:01.279
Now, in this case that
we've switched over,

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:02.953
you can see that the projection,

00:02:02.953 --> 00:02:06.009
that dotted green line, is onto the x axis

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.656
and what this is doing is it's producing

00:02:07.656 --> 00:02:08.933
a cosine wave for us.

00:02:08.933 --> 00:02:12.183
So, this is gonna be cosine of omega t.

00:02:18.026 --> 00:02:21.765
Now, because we're tracking
the progress on the x axis,

00:02:21.765 --> 00:02:24.957
the cosine wave seems to
emerge going down on the page.

00:02:24.957 --> 00:02:27.540
So, the time axis is down here.

00:02:29.714 --> 00:02:31.691
When the green arrow
hits zero right there,

00:02:31.691 --> 00:02:33.882
the value of the cosine was one,

00:02:33.882 --> 00:02:35.747
and when it's minus 180 degrees

00:02:35.747 --> 00:02:37.959
it's minus one on the cosine.

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.876
So, that's why this is cosine wave.

00:02:42.093 --> 00:02:44.192
And, it has the same
frequency as the sine wave

00:02:44.192 --> 00:02:45.275
we generated.

00:02:46.247 --> 00:02:47.781
And now I wanna show
you these two together

00:02:47.781 --> 00:02:51.614
because it's just sort
of a beautiful drawing.

00:03:09.638 --> 00:03:11.288
I'll leave our animation
here for a second.

00:03:11.288 --> 00:03:13.898
We see our sine wave
being generated in yellow

00:03:13.898 --> 00:03:16.719
and in orange we see the
cosine wave being generated

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:21.595
and they're both coming from
this rotating green vector.

00:03:21.595 --> 00:03:24.125
So, this is a really simple
demonstration of a way

00:03:24.125 --> 00:03:25.977
to generate sines and cosines

00:03:25.977 --> 00:03:28.560
with this rotating vector idea.

00:03:29.847 --> 00:03:31.748
We're gonna be able to
generate this rotating vector

00:03:31.748 --> 00:03:34.143
using some ideas from complex arithmetic

00:03:34.143 --> 00:03:35.810
and Euler's formula.

00:03:38.753 --> 00:03:41.086
I find these to be a
really beautiful pattern

00:03:41.086 --> 00:03:45.253
and it emerges from such a
simple idea as a rotating vector.
