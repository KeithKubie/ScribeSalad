1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,130
[inaudible].

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,420
All right, well we could probably do
a show just on Facebook, but let's,

3
00:00:07,421 --> 00:00:10,120
let's move to the others
because in a certain way,

4
00:00:10,121 --> 00:00:12,760
I think Facebook is becoming
increasingly irrelevant,

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,450
at least in the political space that my
judgment of that may be slightly off,

6
00:00:16,451 --> 00:00:19,540
but I just don't see that much
traction any more with young people.

7
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:23,080
Do you think that's basically fair?
I disagree. I think that Facebook,

8
00:00:23,081 --> 00:00:27,160
I think that the majority of
these companies disseminate
their content through

9
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,910
the social media platform.

10
00:00:28,911 --> 00:00:31,050
So I think that there are always
going to be relevant and there is,

11
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,150
they dominate the market in
terms of advertising revenue. Um,

12
00:00:34,151 --> 00:00:37,990
even even the big news organizations,
uh,

13
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,710
disseminate their content through
Facebook. So I think it's,

14
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,780
I think they are relevant.
I don't know.

15
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,670
I don't know what the
trajectory of that is. Yeah.

16
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:48,010
I don't mean that they're irrelevant,
but it seems to me that the,

17
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:52,300
the conversation that I really think is
important about all of this seems to be

18
00:00:52,301 --> 00:00:54,680
happening much more on Twitter.
I assume.

19
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,540
Not necessarily that the money in the
advertising and the mainstream media reach

20
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:03,520
and all of those things aren't relevant
on Facebook, but that the real sort of,

21
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,390
I don't know, the gestalt of this or
something is on Twitter and Youtube.

22
00:01:07,391 --> 00:01:11,470
So that's the, let's ship
there for a second. So, uh,
Twitter, I'm sure you see me,

23
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,640
uh, tweeting all the time about the
shadow bands and the rest of it.

24
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:19,240
So what the hell is going on
with Twitter? Well, we went,

25
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:24,100
we went undercover into Twitter and
last year and early 2018 and we caught a

26
00:01:24,101 --> 00:01:27,970
number of engineers describing
a shadow banning, uh,

27
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,330
removing posts. When people don't know
that they're sharing their content,

28
00:01:31,331 --> 00:01:32,740
they don't know that they're being banned,

29
00:01:32,741 --> 00:01:35,710
that we actually have quotes from the
engineers talking about what they have

30
00:01:35,711 --> 00:01:39,070
done. I mentioned earlier with
this, a direct messaging expert,

31
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:42,880
a guy named [inaudible] Singh
who works on the Twitter DM team,

32
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:48,130
says that he can peruse all of
your messages, your private dms.

33
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,500
Uh, he says that there are key words
that Twitter uses to filter tweets,

34
00:01:53,501 --> 00:01:57,190
uh, the American flag,
God guns. Uh, and then,

35
00:01:57,191 --> 00:02:01,150
then we talked to another engineer,
not jump over the first one there.

36
00:02:01,151 --> 00:02:05,650
So they can literally look at your direct
messaging. That's what they told us.

37
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,890
Private direct messages. They said they
have teams. This is a guy named Clay Hain.

38
00:02:09,891 --> 00:02:14,160
So they have hundred hundreds plus
of people that, and he says, quote,

39
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,150
I've seen a lot of Dick pics on quote.

40
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,010
So I understand they have
to do some of this to, to,

41
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,200
to ban pornography and you know,
Gore and content.

42
00:02:23,201 --> 00:02:25,960
But apparently this is what they told
us that I don't know why they'd have to

43
00:02:25,961 --> 00:02:29,740
look at your private messages, but, and
they've also said that they don't do that.

44
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,290
So that's the thing.
Why do they say one thing in public?

45
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,690
Another thing in private is what
we've found. But, but again,

46
00:02:34,691 --> 00:02:39,520
I try to only speak to what I can
actually a videotape of what the engineers

47
00:02:39,521 --> 00:02:42,370
said.
And this Abenov for Draven guy was,

48
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:46,710
there was a congressional hearing with
a lobbyist. Ted Cruz did ask him, uh,

49
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,270
do you do this? And he
says, we do not do that.

50
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,490
Well then why did your engineer
say they were doing it?

51
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,620
So I just think they're being dishonest.

52
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:58,830
So that's the type of sort of underhanded
tactic they're using the shadow

53
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:01,630
banning cause you have no idea.
Again,

54
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,820
you just don't know when
you put something out.

55
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,970
Is this getting to all of
my people or is it not?

56
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:10,810
Or can some people not retweet it or the
rest of it? I mean it's a pretty clever,

57
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:13,960
if they were trying to silence people,
it's pretty clever way of doing it. Right.

58
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:15,350
I think that's the unethical part.

59
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:18,730
They don't tell people that they are
doing and they don't tell people their

60
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:21,160
political positions.
I just want them to be transparent.

61
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:23,500
I think Facebook kind of thing.
Not to go back to Facebook,

62
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:26,920
but they put out a thing. We are,
we are banning white nationalists.

63
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,970
Well at least they're telling us
where they stand. I'm not the,

64
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,350
not that that is a good thing,
white nationalism.

65
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:35,410
But if they were to do more of
that sort of thing and say we are,

66
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,960
we are taking an editorial
perspective in the New York Times,

67
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:42,070
The Washington Post. You can see on
the op Ed pages what they believe in.

68
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:45,550
They're there. They're rather transparent
about it. I would say more so.

69
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,990
So I think that these companies should
take an editorial position, but when,

70
00:03:48,991 --> 00:03:50,770
when we hear,
um,

71
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,020
print icing at Twitter on the hidden
camera, say who talks like that,

72
00:03:56,021 --> 00:04:01,021
who talks about God and the American
flag and guns must be a Russian Bot says

73
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:02,930
print icing at Twitter.
Well,

74
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,250
I'm fine with that as long
as you say it publicly,

75
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:10,390
as long as you make it part of your
editorial positions so that people know,

76
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:13,570
okay, this company is a,
is extremely left wing.

77
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:19,360
Any of the Banning's or any of this
ever happened to people on the left?

78
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:24,140
I know there were some instances maybe
with Auntie Phi accounts are a couple of

79
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,971
things like that,

80
00:04:24,971 --> 00:04:29,620
but it always seems like
you have conservatives and
people on the right talking

81
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:31,390
about it. Yeah, I don't,
I'm not, to my knowledge,

82
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:34,810
and I think our reporting
overwhelmingly focused on,

83
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,840
on why he even mentioned Donald Trump's
account and insinuated that they were,

84
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:44,850
that they were working with the government
to give information to, I dunno,

85
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,890
deep state individuals.
This is Clay Haynes,

86
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:51,940
a network security engineer at Twitter
told us about Donald Trump's accounts.

87
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,540
I've never seen anything on the
other end of the spectrum from,

88
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,080
from my vantage point when Trump's
account got taken down for those couple of

89
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,330
hours. And then it turned
out to be just, what was it?

90
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:05,650
They said it was some accident or some
young, some low level guy did it for you.

91
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:09,250
That must've been like a Whoa,
that just shows you the power that any,

92
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,810
any individual here would have access
to be able to shut down. Even for our,

93
00:05:13,811 --> 00:05:15,940
for our purposes, we're always,
I'm always trying to prove it.

94
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,970
Like I want to get them on tape admitting
why they did it. But there are the,

95
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,560
there are these,
you know,

96
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:24,160
I guess you could call them low level
people that do things that are not

97
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:29,110
acceptable. Um, and it's policed
more. So at Facebook I would say.

98
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:33,310
Yeah. Anything else going on with Twitter
and that's all that we reported on the

99
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:37,730
shadow banning the, the, the,
the, the private DM messages. Uh,

100
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,220
and the shadow banning were the big ones.

101
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:44,430
What do you make generally of the
political politization of Twitter

102
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,900
specifically? So, you know,

103
00:05:46,901 --> 00:05:50,680
if you were to click on the search bar
on Twitter on any given day and you see

104
00:05:50,681 --> 00:05:52,630
the Twitter moments, it's all, you know,

105
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:55,420
they're always showing you
the Trans Story of the day or,

106
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,160
or whatever the left is
leading with that day. They're

107
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,390
always sort of pushing
that down your throat. Um,

108
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,610
is that just consistent with everything
else you view these companies?

109
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,580
What I will say is that we have more
stories coming on, that sort of thing.

110
00:06:08,581 --> 00:06:12,030
So I would, I would hold my tongue
because I don't want to scoop myself.

111
00:06:12,031 --> 00:06:14,490
We've got a number of people
on the inside that are,

112
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,520
that are maybe focusing on the search
functions at these organizations.

113
00:06:19,951 --> 00:06:21,660
So we'll, we'll, you'll
be, you have to stay tuned

114
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,630
to see what we young, yeah,
that wouldn't surprise me.

115
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:26,180
I mean when I searched certain people,
even if they're verified,

116
00:06:26,181 --> 00:06:28,400
if they happen to be on the right,
sometimes they don't pop up.

117
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:32,660
But I get a zillion random accounts
before that. Or I often think that the,

118
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:37,670
um, the trending tab right. Seems like
it's completely manipulated. You know,

119
00:06:37,671 --> 00:06:40,220
what they are commenting on
and what they're, you know,

120
00:06:40,221 --> 00:06:42,710
cause sometimes there's a comment
beneath the trend or whatever.

121
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,700
It all just seems made up.
And,

122
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:50,410
and, and, and for project Veritas, the,
the priority is to prove it, is to,

123
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:53,500
is to catch them on tape admitting it.
And that is what we will do.

124
00:06:53,501 --> 00:06:55,180
And we will have more stories soon.
Huh.

125
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,270
And all of this, all those
friends. So let's move to youtube.

126
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:03,220
We're on youtube right now. I've had
people in the past, years ago when I did,

127
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,730
at one time I did have an email address
from somebody of youtube and they told

128
00:07:06,731 --> 00:07:07,750
me,
cause I kept saying,

129
00:07:07,751 --> 00:07:10,690
people keep complaining that they
are unsubscribed from my channel.

130
00:07:10,691 --> 00:07:12,250
I kept getting emails every day.

131
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,760
And one time someone from Youtube
admitted to me, they said,

132
00:07:15,761 --> 00:07:17,470
there's a bug on your channel.

133
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,070
And we're trying to work it out
with a couple of weeks after that.

134
00:07:21,071 --> 00:07:23,800
After I followed up a few times and then
I couldn't get any more information,

135
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,740
I got an email from the guy saying
I'm no longer handling this case.

136
00:07:26,741 --> 00:07:27,910
And now you have to go to the,

137
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,970
you don't have an email
address to respond to any more,

138
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:33,830
go to the general tab and
complaining or whatever. Uh,

139
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,800
so I have to publicly
shame them all the time.

140
00:07:35,801 --> 00:07:38,290
You probably see me doing this
with teams and youtube and Twitter.

141
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:42,250
Every time I get demonetized I fight them.
And then they usually not always lie.

142
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,500
Rose, for example, they did not re
monetize. Um, they didn't really,

143
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,880
they did not rule you monetize that one.

144
00:07:48,881 --> 00:07:53,320
It was d monetized by the algorithm
and then confirmed by manual review.

145
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,970
Now that's their right to do that. Again,
you want some transparency with it.

146
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,103
Um,

147
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,680
but unsubscribes video's not going
out to feeds all of these things.

148
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,490
What evidence do we actually
have that these things are here?

149
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:07,711
Well,

150
00:08:07,711 --> 00:08:12,711
we did a story in 2017 between the New
York Times reporter named Nick Dudek and

151
00:08:12,961 --> 00:08:17,940
Youtube. And again, I can only talk
about what I report that that's my rule.

152
00:08:17,941 --> 00:08:20,490
So I don't, I don't like to, to
comment on things that I don't,

153
00:08:20,491 --> 00:08:22,110
I haven't had personal experience with,

154
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,500
but there was a relationship between
these networks like the New York Times and

155
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:32,370
hopping to post and, and Youtube.
And there, there are favors given to,

156
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,930
to these, uh, organizations
over say your show.

157
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,250
Um, and, and that's something that
we've, we've, we reported on an exposed,

158
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,770
so what would a favor look like?
Well,

159
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,940
preferential treatment and the end to
getting into the, the scientifics of it,

160
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:51,480
I'm not sure, but preferential
treatment where the video would, would,

161
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:56,250
would show up more frequently at
the top of the, of search query.

162
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,270
Um,

163
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:02,270
it's this Guy Nick Dudek who was a social
accounts video editor for The New York

164
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:07,050
Times, talked about his relationship
with this guy inside youtube.

165
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,040
So there's a sort of,
you know,

166
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,620
two way street there between the
two companies where favors are done.

167
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:17,130
But with the New York Times now,
why are they doing them favors? I,

168
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,660
that's what I was talking about earlier,

169
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:23,190
where these companies have enormous
power because even the likes of the old

170
00:09:23,191 --> 00:09:26,520
media transmit their messages
through the new media.

171
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,100
That's where the majority of people get
their information from. So, um, but that,

172
00:09:31,101 --> 00:09:34,710
that was that guy nick duty, actually the
executive editor of the New York Times.

173
00:09:34,711 --> 00:09:39,210
Dean Baquet is his name. Actually
we believe, let that guy go.

174
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,100
He actually, uh, uh,

175
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:45,300
terminated Nick Dudek for
telling us this stuff.

176
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,030
No one reported on that. But, uh,

177
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:51,540
I don't know whether they terminated
him for telling the truth or for or for

178
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:54,330
lying about what he had said.
So how do you combat that?

179
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:58,340
The part where every time you guys
released something that I look at it,

180
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,100
I'm always hesitant to retweet it.
I've shared some of your videos sometimes,

181
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,890
but I'm always like, ah, if,

182
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,580
if this is the one where you
know he got duped or you know,

183
00:10:08,581 --> 00:10:11,520
it's only being shared
by Breitbart or whatever,

184
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,360
then it's like you like basically that
you have some sort of secondary layer of

185
00:10:18,781 --> 00:10:22,280
censorship to get through. Well, I'll
tell you what, we've done 200 acres,

186
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,470
Huffington post and buzzfeed and CNN.
They in touch in any of this. Well,

187
00:10:25,471 --> 00:10:26,460
they have touched it.
I mean,

188
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:29,820
Anderson Cooper reported on this stuff
we did during the 2016 election on

189
00:10:29,821 --> 00:10:33,300
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump
are stories in the 2018 election,

190
00:10:33,301 --> 00:10:37,530
made the New York Times. Um, we've
gotten a lot of local media coverage.

191
00:10:37,531 --> 00:10:40,020
We've been in terms of being duped,
weave,

192
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:43,830
weave in and out of 200 undercover
investigators. They say things are edited,

193
00:10:43,831 --> 00:10:46,960
they're edited out of context.
They're, they're not real. I mean,

194
00:10:46,961 --> 00:10:50,160
and you actually ask them what
specific edits are you talking about?

195
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,910
Because to say that video is edited and
it's like saying words are arranged,

196
00:10:53,911 --> 00:10:57,330
all journalism is edited and to
tell a story and they said, well,

197
00:10:57,331 --> 00:11:01,320
you didn't wear the pimp costume and
the acorn office. Well you know, okay.

198
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,100
But I presented myself
as as a, as a pimp. Um,

199
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:08,940
and even the New York Times said that
and pimp protocol doesn't require wearing

200
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:12,570
of Pinot fought for to be a pimp who were
a big pink jacket and drive a Cadillac

201
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:17,010
vehicles. Um, and I said, well, there was
a scene change in the NPR investigation.

202
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:19,350
Okay. Is that the best you got? I mean, I,

203
00:11:19,351 --> 00:11:23,200
there was a cutaway shot or the guy was
laughing and I was narrating over it in

204
00:11:23,201 --> 00:11:24,810
200 investigations.
I mean,

205
00:11:24,811 --> 00:11:28,050
they've printed 300 corrections
and attractions about me.

206
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,280
I have a wall in my office called
the wall of shame and it's all these

207
00:11:32,281 --> 00:11:33,870
corrections and attractions about me.

208
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,040
The Washington Post that I went after
acorn due to an animus about African

209
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,260
Americans voting. They made it up.
Pulitzer prize winning reporter Carol,

210
00:11:41,261 --> 00:11:45,180
letting just made something up
out of whole whole cloth. So,

211
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:50,730
I don't know. I think there is a,
I think it's not about the, um,

212
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,200
the, the, what we do is
real. The tapes, you see,

213
00:11:53,201 --> 00:11:55,960
there's never been a case
where you saw wasn't real.

214
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,960
There was one thing with the
Washington Post that blew up.

215
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,920
They turn their cameras back around
on us and everyone, you know, said,

216
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:04,430
well that's unethical.
What exactly?

217
00:12:04,431 --> 00:12:07,480
It was unethical about it because
we went undercover into CNN.

218
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:12,370
We infiltrated something called
a rain bros at which was a,

219
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,850
a gay group where this producer was in.

220
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,070
Nobody questioned the ethics of it.

221
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,640
Nobody questioned the ethics
because the end was so obvious.

222
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,330
And whether or not you think
that the means are justified,

223
00:12:25,331 --> 00:12:28,540
depends upon whether you think there's a
compelling public interest and what you

224
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:31,300
are exposing.
So when these things get interrupted,

225
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:36,640
then people say it's unethical. But we
think that undercover work is justified,

226
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:40,600
particularly into the big 10 companies
and the big media due to the urgency of

227
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:43,930
the circumstances. But in
all of our work, no one's,

228
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:47,620
no one's ever able to actually say
what exactly has been fake about it.

229
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:52,600
And that's from my perspective or are
you shocked at actually how the collapse

230
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:56,170
of mainstream media has precipitated
so quickly at this point?

231
00:12:56,171 --> 00:12:59,350
Like it seems to me that it's
just, it's over. I mean now,

232
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,970
just in the last couple of weeks now with,

233
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:06,090
with Trump and Russia and just the amount
that these people have just lied over

234
00:13:06,971 --> 00:13:10,930
and over. And finally, thanks to
Twitter and Youtube and the rest of it,

235
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,410
if we're not being shadow and everything,

236
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,030
there's enough of us that can get
a counter narrative out there,

237
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:20,680
but they just keep doing it. Well, I think
it's the death of, I think it's, it's uh,

238
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,500
uh, you've covered,
cause I watch your show,

239
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:26,110
a lot of the political
reasons why media is dying,

240
00:13:26,111 --> 00:13:30,010
but I actually think it's goes back to
Jefferey's Zucker said in the last two

241
00:13:30,011 --> 00:13:33,400
weeks about, I don't know if you saw
that tweet where Brian Stelter said,

242
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,890
we're not investigators.
Well,

243
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,850
that was an unbelievable moment
because that's really, they're not,

244
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,500
they're not investigative reporters.

245
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:44,670
And people have to remember a thing about
CNN talking about CNN, CNN, we don't,

246
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,660
we're not investigators where journalists,
so here's the thing.

247
00:13:46,661 --> 00:13:50,500
This is very important. People talk about
politics. People talk about, you know,

248
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,010
the media is algorithms,
but it's also economics.

249
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,050
Investigative reporting is very,

250
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,820
very expensive and it's a
naturally philanthropic activity.

251
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,490
Investigative reporting,
going back 40 50 years,

252
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,370
it was always a loss leader on
the company's balance sheets.

253
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,070
People have to remember these are,
these are businesses.

254
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,770
They're not interested in the public
interest. They're interested in,

255
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,790
in generating a profit,
and that's fine, but,

256
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:18,070
but don't pretend that you
serve the public interest.

257
00:14:18,071 --> 00:14:22,750
We had a CNN insider on tape. John
Barfield said, this is a business,

258
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,160
the CEO of CNN,

259
00:14:24,161 --> 00:14:28,000
Jeff Zucker told us a stop
talking about the climate accords.

260
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:32,530
Let's get back to Russia.
It's about ratings. It's not
about ethics and it's been,

261
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,960
you know, spending. It's
important to illustrate though.

262
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,570
You're not saying there's anything
inherently wrong with that.

263
00:14:37,571 --> 00:14:40,880
He's allowed to make money. He's
allowed to do business. But,

264
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:44,020
but don't pretend you're operating in
the public interest because investigative

265
00:14:44,021 --> 00:14:47,530
reporting, and let, let, let me, let me,
you had mentioned, you know, people don't,

266
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:51,680
if people are wary of what we do,
it's naturally the tip, the spear.

267
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,800
You have to use deception to a degree.

268
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:59,780
Either you deceive your source
or you deceive your audience.

269
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,950
The problem with journalism and the reason
why it's in decline is because these

270
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:04,971
leakers,

271
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:09,650
these sources and government and elsewhere
intentionally transmit stuff to the

272
00:15:09,651 --> 00:15:13,790
media and they paired it to the
masses. A. I. E. Jeff Zucker saying,

273
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:16,910
we don't investigate what we're told.
And that's what, you know, what,

274
00:15:16,911 --> 00:15:19,580
what has been referred
to as a pseudo event.

275
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:23,870
They create something they
transmitted unquestionably.

276
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,240
And there's the economic factor.

277
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,720
There's a symbiotic relationship
between people and power.

278
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:34,130
What we do at Veritas is we,
we go undercover and we,

279
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,600
we completely defy the narrative.
And that's,

280
00:15:38,601 --> 00:15:41,630
and most networks don't
want to air it because?

281
00:15:41,631 --> 00:15:46,460
Because it's risky because
it's questioning that the
normative order of things,

282
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,800
it's easier to do little videos
about squirrels on skateboards. Now,

283
00:15:50,801 --> 00:15:53,180
I did this big story during the election,
you know,

284
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,900
for Bob Creamer resigned from
the Hillary Clinton campaign.

285
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:01,190
And a lot of these companies say,
we're afraid that if Hillary Clinton wins,

286
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:05,330
she'll take away our FCC license.
So it's, it's, it's this,

287
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:10,331
it's this economic issue that is inherent
in media and it requires independent

288
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:16,070
people to do something about it because
the networks are not going to do

289
00:16:16,071 --> 00:16:19,520
something about it. They are, they're
in the business of generating a profit.

290
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:23,210
It's so fascinating to me because it's
like they're not even in the business.

291
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,490
Right. I get it. So they're in the
business making a profit and that's fine.

292
00:16:25,491 --> 00:16:26,330
That is what businesses,

293
00:16:26,331 --> 00:16:29,840
but they're not even in the business
of pretending anymore because it's like

294
00:16:29,841 --> 00:16:31,490
during the whole Mueller investigation,

295
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,370
every week there was another leak to
the New York Times and it's always an

296
00:16:34,371 --> 00:16:35,151
anonymous leak.

297
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:39,770
And then for the last two years they ran
anonymous leak stories and it's like,

298
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:43,550
shouldn't have, somebody had been
investigating why the Mueller, uh,

299
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,000
operation is leaking. That actually
would have been a story. Right.

300
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,920
Where was that story out
of the New York Times?

301
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:52,870
Well they had and James Clapper and
John Brennan and Munis or intelligence

302
00:16:52,871 --> 00:16:54,050
clapper who lied under oath.

303
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:59,080
Is there intelligence agency people and
maybe not the most always ethical people

304
00:16:59,211 --> 00:17:03,890
and they're just parroting what they're
told on on TV things or when things are,

305
00:17:03,891 --> 00:17:07,430
and again, I go back to this whole
distinction and because when you,

306
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:12,080
when you report from a podium, when you
say something in a press conference, the,

307
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:15,230
the damage to society
done by broadcasting,

308
00:17:15,231 --> 00:17:20,231
what you are told on the record is often
more pernicious than the damage that

309
00:17:20,811 --> 00:17:25,811
say I do by deceiving some guy in a bar
so that I can get the truth out of them.

310
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,100
It is a, it is a huge difference. And,

311
00:17:29,101 --> 00:17:31,830
and I think that journalists
tend to be that you,

312
00:17:31,831 --> 00:17:34,130
you sort of have to play confidence games.
You know,

313
00:17:34,131 --> 00:17:38,420
you have to seduce your source so
to speak. But there's, there is,

314
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,171
there's a two,

315
00:17:39,171 --> 00:17:44,171
there's a relationship between sources
and the media that I think has become

316
00:17:44,301 --> 00:17:46,030
corrupt.
I think that the,

317
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:50,460
the anonymous or the reliance upon
anonymous sources has become corrupted.

318
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,550
You look at Bob Woodward, legendary
reporter that gives a great journalist.

319
00:17:53,551 --> 00:17:55,980
By the way, I don't think these
journalists are bad journalists.

320
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,480
I don't even think they're bad people.

321
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,780
I think they're part of an industrial
system of production that that

322
00:18:00,781 --> 00:18:04,140
manufactures the public's consent.
But you look at Bob Woodward,

323
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,050
he writes a book called fear and he,

324
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:11,970
he uses quotes secondhand from
anonymous sources on background,

325
00:18:11,971 --> 00:18:13,020
on deep background,

326
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,550
hearsay quotes and then he
recreates events and he puts that,

327
00:18:17,551 --> 00:18:21,330
those events in quotation marks.
And I get attacked for selective editing.

328
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:25,380
I don't report anything unless you can
hear and see it come out of the person's

329
00:18:25,381 --> 00:18:27,360
own mouth.
So I think that,

330
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:32,450
I think that journalism has become
corrupted due to this overreliance upon

331
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,640
sources,
anonymous sources especially.

332
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,520
And I think that that's
why we need videotapes.

333
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:43,290
I literally remember being in like junior
high school and watching CNN and they

334
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:47,880
would say a source on Capitol Hill.
And I would always think this is insane.

335
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,340
What sources I Capitola
anyone can be on Capitol Hill.

336
00:18:50,341 --> 00:18:53,820
It could be the guy that's walking his
dog on Capitol Hill who is the janitor

337
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,430
for the, you know, fast
food joint. We don't,

338
00:18:56,431 --> 00:18:59,550
we don't see or we don't
see that sources face.

339
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,380
We don't know what motivates that person.
We don't know what words were used.

340
00:19:03,381 --> 00:19:06,330
You know that that person exists. We
don't know if that person exists. I mean,

341
00:19:06,331 --> 00:19:10,170
can you imagine if I said
there are sources inside CNN,

342
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,430
he says that Jeff Zucker said they'd
call me a liar. Yeah. And, and, and I,

343
00:19:14,431 --> 00:19:15,780
and there's an analogy here.

344
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:18,030
I heard someone say that when
you use an anonymous source,

345
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:22,530
it's like you're taking withdrawal
out of a bank account of credibility,

346
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:27,600
but you have to deposit into the bank
account, trust with the audience.

347
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,390
And nowadays we don't see these,

348
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:35,040
we don't see these anonymous sources
we see on an over reliance upon.

349
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,800
And every time you actually
opened the reporter's notebook,

350
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:42,270
every time you look at the transcript,
every time you see the raw data there,

351
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:46,770
there is a, there is a difference
between what you are told and,

352
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,650
and by the people that are
asking you to trust them.

353
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,860
But that's the bottom line. These, these,

354
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:57,210
these immediate companies don't
trust us with the raw information.

355
00:19:57,211 --> 00:20:00,210
They don't want us to have the raw,
unfiltered truth.

356
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,540
They need to propagandize
us with their version of it.

357
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:07,650
It's crazy once you see it, right,
like once you really clearly see it.

358
00:20:07,651 --> 00:20:12,090
Like I was actually in the green room
with Jordan Peterson while he was being

359
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:15,930
interviewed by Nellie Bowles who was the
author of the New York Times who made

360
00:20:15,931 --> 00:20:19,410
that whole Brouhaha about
enforced monogamy and it's like,

361
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:24,090
that is not what this conversation
was about. Or I had a whole day here,

362
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:28,590
literally an entire day from 8:00 AM
to about APM with a journalist for a

363
00:20:28,591 --> 00:20:33,591
journalist from a der Spiegal who then
wrote a piece about me and labeled me the

364
00:20:34,261 --> 00:20:38,970
grand allusionist of the alt right.
Yeah. They leave their labels. They did.

365
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,230
There's a light and know this at the time,

366
00:20:40,231 --> 00:20:42,570
but there's a law in Germany that
if you're going to print something,

367
00:20:42,571 --> 00:20:44,880
a quote from somebody,
you have to get the quote cleared.

368
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:48,580
So he spends all day with me,
hours of hours and hours and hours.

369
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:52,030
He doesn't quote me once. Wow. I mean
that's the level that, what is that?

370
00:20:52,031 --> 00:20:53,430
It's not selective editing.
Yeah.

371
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:56,260
They called me the master of
ceremonies instead of an anchor.

372
00:20:56,261 --> 00:20:58,060
They used the master of ceremonies.

373
00:20:58,061 --> 00:21:00,310
I mean just like what the Washington
Post Guy, there was nothing.

374
00:21:00,311 --> 00:21:01,900
I was like grand man.
The Washington Post,

375
00:21:01,901 --> 00:21:05,260
this printed like five attractions
just in reporting about me.

376
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,070
It's like these guys have the
audacity to claim that I'm a liar.

377
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:14,110
In one article they said what the latest
project Veritas video leaves out and

378
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:19,111
the actual fact that I allegedly left
out was that this CNN producer that we

379
00:21:19,181 --> 00:21:22,960
recorded was based in Atlanta.
Supposedly this was a big fat,

380
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,300
but I didn't leave it out.
It was in the video.

381
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:29,320
The Washington Post had
to print a retraction that
that they didn't change the

382
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:33,400
headline. What the what the video left
out. They retracted the entire thing.

383
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:37,060
There's another thing in the Washington
Post about this book fear and there was

384
00:21:37,061 --> 00:21:37,894
a quote that said,

385
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:42,670
there's no evidence that he did not
say the things attributed to him in

386
00:21:42,671 --> 00:21:47,030
referencing. There's no evidence. He
did not sell that. This is, you know,

387
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:51,670
we live in this weird world and I think
that videotape cuts through all the

388
00:21:51,671 --> 00:21:53,770
propaganda,
like a hot knife through butter.

389
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:58,330
If you catch these people on video tape,
they're forced to address it.

390
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:02,170
And I think that video is, is, that's
why we choose the medium of video,

391
00:22:02,171 --> 00:22:06,430
because words, words do not
transfix in a way that video does.

392
00:22:06,431 --> 00:22:08,740
And I think that words are the,
frankly,

393
00:22:08,741 --> 00:22:12,850
the propagandists tool because they put
you in a box by calling you names like

394
00:22:12,851 --> 00:22:16,520
that. My calling the masters of
ceremonies by calling you what you were,

395
00:22:16,521 --> 00:22:19,250
you're not what that is. You are. You got,

396
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:21,790
I know we could trade these stories all
day long. I'll just give you a one more.

397
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:23,950
But that same reporter from
New York Times, Nellie Bowles,

398
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,520
she wrote the story when
Peterson and I left Patrion.

399
00:22:27,521 --> 00:22:29,680
They actually did a story on it,
which was quite shocking.

400
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,680
It's a horrible story filled with
factual errors. But even there,

401
00:22:32,681 --> 00:22:36,850
there's a quote from the head of trust
and safety, a patriot and where she says,

402
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:37,241
you know,

403
00:22:37,241 --> 00:22:41,440
you're not allowed to say these words on
our platform except so as I'm sure you

404
00:22:41,441 --> 00:22:42,620
know Carl Benjamin is are going to occur.

405
00:22:42,621 --> 00:22:45,040
I've never said those
words on their platform.

406
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:48,130
I contacted the author and it's like she
just doesn't care and she knows she's

407
00:22:48,131 --> 00:22:50,980
not going to get fired and why even
tell the truth. So it's like they,

408
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:51,850
they just don't,

409
00:22:51,851 --> 00:22:55,270
one thing that people are doing and more
frequency is recording their interviews

410
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:56,640
with these people that we,

411
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,530
and that's something that I would
encourage as long as it's legal to do so.

412
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,930
But you're on the record. So it's, it's,

413
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:05,740
it's legal because they're consenting to
the conversation even in, in California.

414
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:10,470
And we had one individual inside
CNN record, Alison Camera,

415
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,010
she does a long panel discussion about
voter fraud that cut the tape right

416
00:23:15,011 --> 00:23:17,800
before the guy actually
brought up instances.

417
00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:19,870
So something that people are doing now,

418
00:23:19,871 --> 00:23:24,310
is there audio recording these interviews
for that reason and releasing the full

419
00:23:24,311 --> 00:23:25,720
interview on Youtube?
Right.

420
00:23:25,721 --> 00:23:28,610
So we've seen a lot of that actually
Tommy Robinson has done that. Right?

421
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:32,630
This guy, Avi Yemeni has done that with
a yes, this Jim J. I would not. I would,

422
00:23:32,631 --> 00:23:33,670
I would employ your audience,

423
00:23:33,671 --> 00:23:38,671
never do an interview with the
press unless you audio tape it.

424
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:42,400
And that's for your own, um, for
your own protection for sure.

425
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:45,190
The other thing you can do,
at least in our situation,

426
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:49,850
I really only do these shows now.
If it's live right, if it's alive,

427
00:23:49,851 --> 00:23:50,510
you can edit me.

428
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:54,650
You might be able to sandbag me and I
have to be smart enough to work with that,

429
00:23:54,651 --> 00:23:57,650
but you at least can edit me.
So Andrew Breitbart was my,

430
00:23:57,651 --> 00:24:00,380
one of my mentors and he would take
this very, we were different people,

431
00:24:00,381 --> 00:24:04,010
but he would take this perspective of,
you know, just as much press as possible.

432
00:24:04,011 --> 00:24:08,360
I'm proudly who I am. I guess it
was a different world 10 years ago,

433
00:24:08,361 --> 00:24:11,690
but he would do, he would
just give them everything. Um,

434
00:24:11,691 --> 00:24:15,620
I think that there's two different ways
to play it, but we certainly to record,

435
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,140
uh, the interviews is a good, a good path.

436
00:24:18,141 --> 00:24:20,990
And some people are leaking us
these audio tapes and we put the,

437
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:25,640
we put the long version out on Twitter
and Alison Camerata at CNN was so

438
00:24:25,641 --> 00:24:30,360
humiliated by this raw version of the
interview that she actually removed she,

439
00:24:30,361 --> 00:24:34,850
she left Twitter because people were
tweeting at her while all this, uh,

440
00:24:34,851 --> 00:24:38,420
all these angry tweets. So we talked
a little bit about anonymous sources.

441
00:24:38,421 --> 00:24:42,470
What do you make of just
like the anonymous accounts
all over the platforms that

442
00:24:42,471 --> 00:24:46,430
often are the drivers of a lot of
the bad behavior. So for example,

443
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,740
there are anonymous accounts that have 20,
30,

444
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:51,470
40,000 followers that I see all day long,

445
00:24:51,471 --> 00:24:54,740
selectively editing video clips
of me or just any, you know,

446
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,150
any decent human being.

447
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:59,390
And it's like they can do it with complete
impunity because their names aren't

448
00:24:59,391 --> 00:25:02,330
attached to any of this. And what,
what are you going to do? What,

449
00:25:02,331 --> 00:25:04,280
what do we do in situations? I mean, I,

450
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:08,120
I've got people impersonating
me and I'm not verified.

451
00:25:08,121 --> 00:25:11,720
I got 500,000 followers that this morning.
I don't know who else.

452
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:15,230
I guess there's Julian Assan.
She's also not verified. Um,

453
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:17,150
I don't know how to solve these problems.

454
00:25:17,151 --> 00:25:20,890
I don't know what the public
policy solutions are. My,
my perspective. And I mean,

455
00:25:20,891 --> 00:25:22,160
everyone asked me what do we do about it?

456
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,190
I say the solution is
to inform the people.

457
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,690
The solution is to show people
the rot, the corruption, to,

458
00:25:28,691 --> 00:25:33,260
to rake the muck as it were, to be a
muckraker to illuminate all the problems.

459
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,250
Because I think the solutions become self
evident when people know that there's

460
00:25:37,251 --> 00:25:41,140
a guy in a room in San Francisco
arbitrarily determined, oh,

461
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:43,610
we're going to take away and
take away the blue check mark.

462
00:25:43,611 --> 00:25:48,611
We don't like that guy's politics film
that show people those conversations

463
00:25:48,621 --> 00:25:52,920
behind closed doors because then they
can't get it. There's impunity. They,

464
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,110
they can't get away with it. And,
and that's the, that is the solution.

465
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:01,820
The solution is to expose it. Um,
what, I mean, I can't believe that I'm,

466
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,170
I mean, I, on one hand,

467
00:26:03,171 --> 00:26:06,100
I don't want to complain about it because
it makes it me feel like I'm, you know,

468
00:26:06,101 --> 00:26:08,900
ingratiating myself to Twitter.
I'm not,

469
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:13,270
I'm not a verified human being
or a platform. And I and, and,

470
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:16,970
and why not? What is the
definition of, of being verified.

471
00:26:16,971 --> 00:26:20,750
But certainly when you are verified, it
does help your, your stories get out.

472
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,770
It does. It's people know
that it's actually you and
I'm sure you've had people,

473
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,400
many people impersonating me. I don't,
I don't know what the solution is,

474
00:26:28,401 --> 00:26:32,870
but I know that to find the solution we
have to properly identify the problem

475
00:26:32,871 --> 00:26:34,310
and educate the people
with what they're saying.

476
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:38,120
You need a mole in the verified
department who can just click that button.

477
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:41,540
Maybe we already have one. Ah, it's, they
always question is whether to cut bait.

478
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,291
If you will be,

479
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:45,450
if you will be verified with your blue
check by the time this video goes up,

480
00:26:45,451 --> 00:26:47,520
I will be very impressed.
That would be amazing.

481
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:51,210
That'll be interesting somehow I think
you haven't been sitting on that one.

482
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,570
Now the question with undercover
work is when do you cut bait?

483
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,740
Because you have these people who are in
on the inside and then you have to make

484
00:26:58,741 --> 00:27:01,020
an editorial decision on
when do we release the story?

485
00:27:01,021 --> 00:27:05,490
Like we have people right now, right now
as I speak inside the big networks, um,

486
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,080
who work for them.

487
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:12,890
They come to me and they are so sick by
how these companies project themselves.

488
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:17,730
You know, all the news that's fit to
print, the most trusted name in news.

489
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:22,620
That is not what they hear in, in
the newsrooms. They here, they,

490
00:27:22,621 --> 00:27:24,750
I mean we had one person
say that people were crying,

491
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:28,050
they were crying the night of the
election at the Washington Post.

492
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:33,390
Everyone was sobbing and the things that
were being said that night would shock

493
00:27:33,391 --> 00:27:35,820
you.
So these people come to me,

494
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:40,710
we're calling it the be brave initiative
and we think that the heroes are,

495
00:27:40,711 --> 00:27:43,980
these are these individuals
on the inside and,

496
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:46,950
and I think that they'll blow the
whistle, they'll tape them. That works.

497
00:27:46,951 --> 00:27:51,420
And hopefully that that will change
people's perception of big media once and

498
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:55,470
for all. How do you think a
Trump somehow understood this?

499
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:01,160
How is it that this orange man with crazy
hair somehow understood that like this

500
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,460
wasn't like he was,
you know,

501
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:07,350
he was always sort of a Twitter
troll and doing this thing.

502
00:28:07,351 --> 00:28:10,770
And he understood the celebrity and he
understood public relations in business

503
00:28:10,771 --> 00:28:14,040
obviously. But this very specific thing
that we've been talking about for the,

504
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,670
for the last hour,
Trump really seems to understand this.

505
00:28:17,671 --> 00:28:19,590
Do you have any sense of what that is?

506
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:23,540
My perspective is that it was about earned
media. They was about generating are.

507
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:26,190
I think that there was some something
written about this where he,

508
00:28:26,191 --> 00:28:29,790
his advisor said, you can't run
this campaign on earned media alone.

509
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,580
You have to be more traditionally
said the hell I can't watch me.

510
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,390
And he got some, I don't know how much it
was, five, $10 billion in earned media.

511
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:40,110
It's this, it's this notion
of, I think a lot of people,

512
00:28:40,111 --> 00:28:42,210
particularly on the conservative
side of the spectrum,

513
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:47,330
tend to complain about wine, about, you
know, the mainstream media. They, they,

514
00:28:47,331 --> 00:28:52,050
they, I call it the conservative ghetto.
They stay talking to themselves. But,

515
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:56,430
but then there's this other vision where
you were, you, you, you hack the media,

516
00:28:56,431 --> 00:28:59,880
you, you, you participate in
the media. It's again, going
back to Andrew Breitbart,

517
00:28:59,881 --> 00:29:01,980
he would, he would, um, uh,

518
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:07,050
love to go on these shows
that the definition of success
is being covered by the

519
00:29:07,051 --> 00:29:11,400
mainstream media in it's, it's, it's
a tough dance because they attack you,

520
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:14,550
they call you and Julie, you know,
Jordan names and those sorts of things.

521
00:29:14,551 --> 00:29:17,820
But if you play it the right way
and he covered by the media, that's,

522
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:18,780
that's real power.

523
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:23,780
And Trump understood that he could
win the election with earned media.

524
00:29:23,851 --> 00:29:27,870
It was absolutely brilliant. Nobody else
saw it. Everyone thought he was nuts.

525
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:33,180
But he won the election on earned
media on getting these big ABC, CBS,

526
00:29:33,181 --> 00:29:37,350
NBC New York Times to, to cover him,
to talk about him. It was brilliant.

527
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,960
It was amazing. And everyone thought
he couldn't, it couldn't be done.

528
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:42,730
And he did it. And I, and by
the I have the same vision,

529
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:47,790
although on a lesser
degree I tell my team,

530
00:29:48,101 --> 00:29:49,180
I tell my employees,

531
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,450
the definition of success is to get on
the front page of the New York Times.

532
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,420
Because in Manhattan,
what, what you, you know,

533
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:56,710
people have to realize is that if
it is not in the New York Times,

534
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,270
it does not exist.

535
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,740
They don't pay attention
to things on the outside.

536
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:07,920
I hate to give them that power, but
it's still true to a degree. So to,

537
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:11,950
to be successful is to be covered
by the people that we hate.

538
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,660
And also,

539
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,770
and also not to get stuck where we
want to be loved by those people. Yes.

540
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:22,660
But because that's the problem. That is,
that is the problem. We want to be loved.

541
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:24,690
And Rush Limbaugh says, you know, I,

542
00:30:24,691 --> 00:30:28,990
I learned that to be hated
as a sign of success.

543
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,040
And that's where a lot of Republicans
go wrong. Trump did not go wrong.

544
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:37,480
A lot of Republicans want to be loved
by the New York Times, by politico.

545
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,650
Um, it's tempting. I want to be loved
you. Everyone wants to be loved,

546
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:46,480
but we're going to be hated for what
we say and do. So it's being co,

547
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:50,740
so Trump's getting covered by them, but
he also calls them fake news. Brilliant.

548
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:54,360
It's Andrew Breitbart 2.0 all right.

549
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:57,890
So in, in summation here, if you had to,

550
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,710
if you were in the predictions game,
where do you see the platforms do,

551
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:06,200
do you sense that the way we
communicate right now we're,

552
00:31:06,201 --> 00:31:11,201
we're all on these things and we're all
subjected to these objective rules and

553
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:17,360
seemingly arbitrary decisions and all
of those things. Do you sense that five,

554
00:31:17,361 --> 00:31:20,510
10 years from now it's going to still
be the same or do you think that things

555
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:21,590
are going to massively change?

556
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:26,620
They are only going to change
if independent citizens
have the courage and the

557
00:31:26,621 --> 00:31:30,400
willpower to do something about it?
I don't trust the politicians.

558
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:33,880
I don't trust the people on television
to do anything about it because they're

559
00:31:33,881 --> 00:31:36,850
stuck in the status quo
and they're fat and happy.

560
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:39,820
It's going to require citizens,
independent people. You know,

561
00:31:39,821 --> 00:31:43,060
some of these insiders,
I know some of them and others,

562
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:47,980
they have to blow the whistle. They have
to summon the righteous indignation.

563
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,450
I think that journalism has the
power to change hearts and minds,

564
00:31:52,451 --> 00:31:57,100
real investigative reporting,
uh, to, to be the, uh,

565
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:59,710
what has been called the
custodians of conscience.

566
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,720
And if we can shock that people,

567
00:32:01,721 --> 00:32:05,410
show them what's going on
behind the closed doors, I
think it can change things.

568
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,970
If that does not happen,

569
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:10,330
I think we'll enter a brave new
world where that doesn't happen.

570
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,780
We're a long gun, right? Yeah, but,
but, but, but, but there are people,

571
00:32:13,781 --> 00:32:15,190
I know these people,
they're going to blow the whistle.

572
00:32:15,191 --> 00:32:19,180
But if that does not happen, then
we're going to enter a brave new world.

573
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:23,650
But where the story has to be so big,
here's the silver lining.

574
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,560
Even if we get banned,
even if you get banned and I get band,

575
00:32:26,561 --> 00:32:27,430
everyone gets banned,

576
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:32,050
the stories will come out and other
people will share them proxies,

577
00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:34,820
we'll share them and they'll
share the information that,

578
00:32:34,821 --> 00:32:38,350
that people will have a right
to know that we'll want to see.

579
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:41,810
But I think it's going
to require an effort by,

580
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:46,130
by independent citizens and brave
patriots willing to blow the whistle.

581
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:50,550
That is the only saving grace I
can see for this country. Uh, the,

582
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:54,470
the heroes amongst us, they, they
can, uh, to pitch a little bit.

583
00:32:54,471 --> 00:32:57,020
They can go to our website
and I will give them a camera.

584
00:32:57,021 --> 00:32:58,160
I will pay their legal bills,

585
00:32:58,161 --> 00:33:02,000
I will hire them if they
are fired by their employer.

586
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:04,370
Twitter and Facebook have not sued me.
I get sued a lot.

587
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,380
I have not been sued by those companies.

588
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:11,680
They do not want to give heft and weight
to the stories that we have unmasked.

589
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:16,040
They do not want to give us free
publicity. So there is a, uh,

590
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:19,190
a strategy here to,
to hold these people accountable.

591
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,900
I'm going to ask you one more actually,
which is,

592
00:33:20,901 --> 00:33:24,950
I've asked this of a few of my guests
that I think are on the forefront of

593
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:29,780
saying on popular things are doing work
that is challenging and interesting way.

594
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,260
What is it about you? Why, why,

595
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:35,390
why do you James O'keefe
put your ass on the line

596
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:39,280
if I, if, if very tasks went away
tomorrow and I had no employees,

597
00:33:39,281 --> 00:33:43,290
I'd be out hustling on the street
with a cam quarter and this is I,

598
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,940
this is what I was born to do.
Like I can't do anything else.

599
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,880
And it goes back to this whole
idea of a justice complex,

600
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:52,450
like the acorn investigation
that cost me $1,000 to do.

601
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:56,200
I borrowed my grandmother's Chinchilla
coat, a camcorder that a friend gave me,

602
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:59,920
an a borrowed copy of final
cut pro and acorn was defunded.

603
00:33:59,921 --> 00:34:02,050
Both houses of Congress are
democratically controlled.

604
00:34:02,051 --> 00:34:05,470
President Obama signed the bill.
It doesn't take money to do this.

605
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:10,510
It doesn't take power to do
this. It takes, it takes will.

606
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:13,810
It takes the design.
It takes a belief in justice.

607
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,020
It takes a desire to to expose something,

608
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:20,740
to inform your fellow citizens and
finding people who are likeminded.

609
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:23,710
If they were to take away my organization,
I'd be doing this the rest of my life.

610
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:26,260
I had nothing else I could
do because I believe in it.

611
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,330
I actually believe in what I'm doing
and the people that I find I have,

612
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:34,450
I have a profound responsibility
to serve the the people,

613
00:34:34,451 --> 00:34:38,620
to tell the truth to the people and people
coming forward that want to blow the

614
00:34:38,621 --> 00:34:41,920
whistle. This is, this is
why Veritas now exists,

615
00:34:41,921 --> 00:34:45,670
is to equip those people
and to protect them.

616
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:49,090
I'd be willing to go to jail to
protect a source. I have been to jail.

617
00:34:49,091 --> 00:34:53,020
I've been incarcerated. I've been
sued. I've been set up. It's not,

618
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,070
it's not the worst thing.

619
00:34:54,071 --> 00:34:58,960
The worst thing is not to to serve the
people that come to me and want to tell a

620
00:34:58,961 --> 00:34:59,530
story,

621
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:04,150
and that's why we exist and we're
going to keep doing it until people are

622
00:35:04,151 --> 00:35:04,984
honest.

623
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,850
On that note,

624
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:11,290
you can follow James and Project Veritas
on Twitter for as long as they're still

625
00:35:11,291 --> 00:35:14,710
on Twitter.
It's at project underscore very tough.
