00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.730
New research thinks it
knows how many people you

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.884
are going to kiss
before you settle down.

00:00:04.884 --> 00:00:05.675
Challenge accepted.

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:13.320
Anthony here for D
News and you know,

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.312
with it being the new
year, Valentine's Day

00:00:15.312 --> 00:00:17.770
looming in the distance, we
tend to think a lot about love,

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.600
comparing our lives to others,
figuring out how we're doing.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.760
Where do we stack up to
the rest of the world

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.100
in the hunt for true love?

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.100
Well, author Graeme
Simsion released

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.590
a novel last year called
The Rosie Project.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.520
It's all about a guy who
uses surveys and big data

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.570
to try and find
the optimal wife.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.450
Cute idea and a really
appropriate one because Simsion

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.420
worked in data
modeling and research

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.524
before becoming a writer.

00:00:40.524 --> 00:00:41.940
Dude even had a
Ted Talk about it.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.320
So it's no surprise that
as part of his research,

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.840
he did some, well, research.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.800
He surveyed 2,000
people in the UK

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.930
to see just what the average
romantic life for men and women

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.570
is before they find the one.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.410
And according to his data,
women will kiss 15 people

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.600
before they settle down.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.160
Men will kiss 15.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.970
On average, women will be
stood up for a date once.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.879
It'll happen to men twice.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:05.960
That's cold, ladies.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.250
Women will have seven sexual
partners and four one night

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.540
stands while men have
10 partners and six one

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.340
night stands.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.120
Both will live with someone
once before finding the person

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.550
that they will
live with forever.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.510
And in both cases,
someone's probably

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.830
going to lose a nice couch.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.280
Before you start tallying
your scores compared

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.290
to other people, you
should know people

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.170
lie like crazy on these surveys.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.270
Seriously, Norman
Brown, a psychologist

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.900
from the University of Michigan,
noticed that in most surveys,

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.740
men were reporting two to
four times as many lifetime

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.270
sexual partners as women.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.930
In a particular study that
he ran of 2,000 people,

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.190
women reported eight average
partners and men claimed 32.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.640
Those numbers do not add up,
you guys, so he got sneaky.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.240
A question at the end of
the survey asked, hey,

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.220
did you lie back there, like at
the sexual partners question?

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.620
And 5% of the respondents
immediately said yes.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.230
10% said they
didn't lie, but they

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.100
knew that their answer
probably wasn't accurate.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.550
Called out, y'all.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:08.630
But it's not just lying.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.820
There is an interesting
thing about how

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.700
men and women calculate their
answers to these questions.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.410
Women use a raw count.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.490
They actually go through a list
in their heads in the moment.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.370
That's a method that actually
leads to under-reporting

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.120
because you might forget
someone or, you know,

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.660
want to forget someone.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.590
Men are more likely to
use rough approximation,

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.620
just straight up guess
based on what feels right,

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.680
and that's a method that tends
to lead to over-reporting

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.930
because instead of leaving
out people you forget,

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.680
you add in how many people
you think you're forgetting.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.700
You know, like I
slept with probably

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.327
like a bunch of models.

00:02:43.327 --> 00:02:44.160
You don't know them.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.790
They live in Niagara Falls
or whatever, I guess.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.240
I mean, not that
I've ever done that.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.680
You can't entirely
trust data like this,

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.650
and even if you could, why
compare yourself to others?

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.130
Natural curiosity is
fine, but it's important

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.500
not to actually use
this stuff as some sort

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.220
of a yardstick
for your own life.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.090
Average does not mean normal.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.575
It doesn't matter if your
numbers skew higher or lower

00:03:06.575 --> 00:03:08.700
on this stuff because
everyone's life is different.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.340
Average just crushes
all of human experience

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.160
into one number,
although if your goal is

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.856
to smooch more people in the
new year, I say have at it

00:03:17.856 --> 00:03:18.980
because smooching is great.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.530
You know, I honestly compare
my life to other people's way

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.860
more than I should, but I'm
getting better about it.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.740
How about you?
