The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by on it.com that's o,

2
00:00:07.891 --> 00:00:11.970
n n.
I.
T.
Makers of Alpha brain new mood,

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.480
which Brian needs to keep them stable.
It keeps him alive.
Ladies.
Gentlemen,

4
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.480
if it wasn't for new mood off the deep end,
I would have no brain.

5
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.580
You would barely be alive,
man.
Uh,
what?
What are,

6
00:00:25.581 --> 00:00:27.930
what are nootropics the fuck are you talking about Joe Rogan?

7
00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:32.931
What does Alpha brain is way too complicated for me to explain in a podcast when

8
00:00:33.481 --> 00:00:37.110
I'm this high on marijuana.
So let me be honest with you.

9
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.520
You can you go to [inaudible] Dot Com that's o.
N N.
It.

10
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.440
If you're interested in nootropics are in luck.

11
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.330
And what essentially are nutrients as an Alpha male pill?
Can I have one?

12
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.790
It's not that it doesn't do anything for your penis.
It might make you like,
no,

13
00:00:52.791 --> 00:00:57.300
I'm excited about the 45 one public.
You know that really it's a there,

14
00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.450
it helps the brain produce more neurotransmitters.

15
00:01:00.451 --> 00:01:04.440
The idea is it's the essential nutrients that your brain needs to fire more

16
00:01:04.441 --> 00:01:07.230
efficiently and it gives you like a little,
not a buzz.

17
00:01:07.231 --> 00:01:11.490
It's not like a coffee buzz,
you know,
it's not like a stimulant buzz.
But I,

18
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.460
I take them before every show taken for every UFC.

19
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.850
I take them for anything where I really feel like I have to fire my brain and I

20
00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:19.980
really feel like it works and it makes it,

21
00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:22.740
there's a bunch of different clinical studies that are on a bunch of different

22
00:01:22.741 --> 00:01:25.050
ingredients that are in each,
uh,
you know,

23
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.720
the Alpha brain like is one formula and there's um,

24
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.560
shroom tech is another formula is about a bunch of different things that do

25
00:01:31.561 --> 00:01:36.480
different,
some for sports performance but cool.
But there's Alpha brain shit is,

26
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.620
it's all new tropics.

27
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.040
It's all different vitamins that have been shown to have a positive effect on

28
00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:41.890
human neurochemistry.

29
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.150
And some of them they use for like people that have Alzheimer's patients and

30
00:01:45.151 --> 00:01:47.100
some of them are kind of controversial.
Look,

31
00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:49.290
I think if anybody's interested in any of this stuff,

32
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.290
you need to just Google it and sort of research it and don't,

33
00:01:52.291 --> 00:01:54.210
don't just start taking any pills.

34
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.170
But I could take you tell you from my personal experience that I've been taking

35
00:01:58.171 --> 00:02:01.770
nootropics for a long time.
I firmly believe in vitamins,
supplements,

36
00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:05.520
eating healthy.
I think just just nootropics is not enough.

37
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.080
Certainly you need to,

38
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.770
the most important thing is get nutrients in your body that before anybody sells

39
00:02:10.771 --> 00:02:13.320
you any pills or anything,
you should be eating really good food.

40
00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:14.760
That's like the most important thing.

41
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.050
They don't even know if you get everything exactly from a vitamin that you could

42
00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:21.600
get from the actual food with the vitamin in it.

43
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.850
And there's a lot of controversy on that.
I know that,
uh,

44
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.870
it's certainly better to supplement to ensure that you have a good supply of

45
00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:34.110
nutrients that your body can use to repair itself.
And it makes me feel better.

46
00:02:34.111 --> 00:02:38.880
It gives me more energy and I'm just a huge proponent of,
of health.

47
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.390
I think a,
it's a super overlooked thing.
It's too easy to overlook,

48
00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:46.160
but you can get into it,
you can get into it and it can help your body and your,

49
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.030
when your body works better,
your brain works better.

50
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.250
It sounds like Sylvester Stallone Club sounds like Cobra

51
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.540
<v 1>when your buddy lived [inaudible] but uh,</v>

52
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.080
we also have a kettle bells

53
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.240
<v 2>and</v>

54
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.710
<v 0>battle ropes in.
Now these are the,
the newest addition to on at.com.
And if you,</v>

55
00:03:04.711 --> 00:03:07.080
uh,
have ever seen kettlebell workouts before,

56
00:03:07.081 --> 00:03:10.620
they're essentially like a bowling ball or cannon ball with a fucking handle on

57
00:03:10.621 --> 00:03:10.950
it.

58
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.610
And you swing these things around and do all these crazy exercises with it and

59
00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:17.430
it gives you awesome functional strength.
It's,

60
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.460
you learn to use your body in an athletic manner to move this heavy rock.

61
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:23.151
And it,
it,

62
00:03:23.151 --> 00:03:26.880
it translates into physical activities in a way that I believe that like

63
00:03:26.881 --> 00:03:29.730
straight bodybuilding type exercises don't really,
I mean,

64
00:03:29.731 --> 00:03:32.550
you can do bodybuilding exercises,
still be an amazing athlete,

65
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.653
don't get me wrong,

66
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.400
but I don't necessarily think it's the best way to improve athletic performance

67
00:03:38.401 --> 00:03:40.800
with like isolation type exercises.

68
00:03:40.801 --> 00:03:44.130
I've always felt like it's you're way better off.
Um,

69
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.050
doing things that move your whole body like Olympic lifts or it battle ropes.

70
00:03:49.051 --> 00:03:52.080
Something where your f about what battle ropes are.
These long,
heavy,

71
00:03:52.081 --> 00:03:57.081
40 foot long giant fucking sailor ropes and you slam these things up and down.

72
00:03:57.691 --> 00:03:59.040
It's an incredible workout.

73
00:03:59.041 --> 00:04:02.960
You do it in sprints like you sprint for 30 seconds and then rest for 20 in a

74
00:04:02.961 --> 00:04:04.140
sprint for 30 seconds.

75
00:04:04.141 --> 00:04:09.141
It's fucking nuts and it gives you insane endurance and sync grip you like get

76
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.640
fucking nutty forearm strength and shit.

77
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.510
<v 2>Tom Rhodes need to get involved in this.</v>

78
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.780
I take one on the road with you on a fucking bowling bag.
That's it.

79
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.470
My new carry on luggage.
That's it.
Anyway,
go to go to ana.com

80
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:21.920
<v 0>if you're interested in any of the supplements,</v>

81
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.800
one thing we can tell you if you order Alpha brain or any,

82
00:04:24.801 --> 00:04:27.860
any of the new nootropics there is for the first 30 pills,

83
00:04:27.861 --> 00:04:31.340
there's a 100% money back guarantee.
You don't have to return the product.

84
00:04:31.341 --> 00:04:34.010
You just say it doesn't work.
I don't like it.
It sucks.
Whatever.

85
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.770
We're so convinced that you're going to enjoy it.

86
00:04:36.771 --> 00:04:39.830
They're going to want to buy more and we're so convinced that it's a,
it's a,

87
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.210
it's a solid product.
I,
the last thing I want to do is rip anybody off.

88
00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.680
I think it's much more important that people don't feel ripped off before you

89
00:04:48.681 --> 00:04:51.530
even think about making money.
It has to be an even exchange to me.

90
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.370
So we wanted to make this as easy as clean as possible.
First 30 pills,

91
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.780
a hundred percent money back guarantee,
and a,
you're going to like it.

92
00:04:58.781 --> 00:05:01.580
You're gonna enjoy it.
It's,
it's fascinating stuff,
but Google it,
look into it.

93
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.390
There's another product called neuro,
one guy named Bill Bill Roman Ascii.

94
00:05:05.391 --> 00:05:08.870
Put it up.
Very similar type of product and I recommend that as well.

95
00:05:08.871 --> 00:05:09.704
It's excellent.

96
00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.460
But if you want to buy a Alpha brain or shroom tech or any of those supplements,

97
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.970
use the code name Rogan.
Save yourself 10% off.
All right,
you dirty bitches.

98
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.440
Tom Rhodes is here.
Brian [inaudible]

99
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.070
<v 2>don't man of mystery
experience.</v>

100
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.740
Try my day.
Joe Rogan podcast all day.

101
00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.360
Power Full Tom Rhodes,
ladies and gentleman,
John Man.

102
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.010
And I don't,
I don't work out too much.

103
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.310
You don't have a table that's just a sales pitch.

104
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.440
I'm just trying to get people to buy rocks.

105
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.570
I'm sending cannon balls through the mail son.

106
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.910
It's a sales pitch.
That's awesome.
But it does work.
I mean,
if you're,

107
00:05:50.911 --> 00:05:53.040
if you're down with working out,
man,
those pills sound great.

108
00:05:53.041 --> 00:05:56.910
That's my kind of work.
I'll get you some of that.
Wash it down.
Yeah,
it will help.

109
00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.070
It would help a little bit

110
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.870
<v 3>more,
Tom,
if we get you into some yoga classes.</v>

111
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.620
<v 4>I bet.
I was just,
I was hesitant to say that.
Uh,
I,
I,</v>

112
00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.170
I,
a few years ago I was really into Bikram Yoga,

113
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.090
so was a hot one and I just love it and I'm,
I'm,
I'm not even good at it,

114
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.340
but,
uh,
you know,
I was very svelte when I was doing it and uh,

115
00:06:17.341 --> 00:06:19.890
I'll do it periodically now.
It's good to do when you're traveling,

116
00:06:19.891 --> 00:06:21.900
but when I was living in Los Angeles,

117
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.230
I would go to this headquarters and there was this little gay Indian instructor

118
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.880
and I hated this guy.
He was constantly yelling at me,
Tom,
you're doing it wrong.

119
00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:33.900
You're doing it wrong.
And I'm like,
just holding the position.
I'm like,
God,

120
00:06:33.901 --> 00:06:38.700
where's this going on my ass?
You know.
And uh,
one time he,
uh,
uh,

121
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.120
he was cause most yoga instructors or cream puffs,
they don't yell at you.

122
00:06:42.121 --> 00:06:45.270
This guy would yell at people and he didn't like somebody would lie down and

123
00:06:45.271 --> 00:06:48.660
he'd go get up,
get up.
This is not silver lake.

124
00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.250
Like apparently like they're real cream puffs in silver lake.
But um,

125
00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:57.570
one time this guy was,
I'm in this la one,
the headquarters,

126
00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.210
I guess the actors or whatever.

127
00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.490
Some guys go in there and their underwear and there was a guy in and he hit

128
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.740
these Calvin Klein striped underwear and the,
and the,
and the LEDs.
And he's like,

129
00:07:07.741 --> 00:07:07.891
yeah,

130
00:07:07.891 --> 00:07:10.860
he was like a couple of people down from me and the little gay Indian and start

131
00:07:10.861 --> 00:07:11.370
to goes,

132
00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:15.180
I just want to say you men who wants to come in here with your underwear,

133
00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:16.410
what is that?

134
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:21.030
You in the striped Kevin Kline's do you think we want to see that I'm gay and I

135
00:07:21.031 --> 00:07:24.240
don't want to see that.
And that was really awesome.

136
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.970
<v 3>Well that sounds awesome.</v>

137
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.330
But the other part of them sounds like the opposite of what a yoga guy supposed

138
00:07:29.331 --> 00:07:31.700
to be like,
you know,
this is not silver lake.

139
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.900
<v 4>Yeah.
One time he comes over to me,
I was,
you know,</v>

140
00:07:34.901 --> 00:07:37.720
and he shows me how to do some position and then he goes,
what's your name?

141
00:07:37.721 --> 00:07:41.710
And I go,
Tom and I go,
so does that mean I'm not sure?

142
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.150
<v 3>Tom,
you're always yelling at,</v>

143
00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.930
apparently there was another guy in the class named Tom who like apparently

144
00:07:46.931 --> 00:07:47.950
really sucked.
Oh.

145
00:07:47.951 --> 00:07:51.160
So he was yelling at him and thought he was yelling at me for like three months.

146
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.500
Oh,
that's hilarious.
And it turns out it was somebody else.
I was just,

147
00:07:53.501 --> 00:07:56.110
you were just like,
keep your eyes just locked in the position.

148
00:07:56.111 --> 00:07:59.590
Just holding that shit,
trying to do it perfect.
It's kind of,

149
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:02.380
Yoga is very humbling because if you,
even if you think you're a Badass,

150
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.430
he's like,
Whoa,
a fucking good bench press two 15 and even one of those guys,

151
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.740
it's fucking hard to just stand there.

152
00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:12.430
It's hard to stand there and certain positions because this is like a lot of,

153
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.980
a lot of those like really deep poses where you like,

154
00:08:14.981 --> 00:08:16.270
you can't believe how difficult

155
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:21.260
<v 4>right to maintain.
Uh,
what I love about it is,
uh,</v>

156
00:08:21.261 --> 00:08:25.460
you know,
you see old people that look fantastic in these yoga classes.

157
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:29.740
<v 3>Well it lets you use your body and uh,
like,
uh,</v>

158
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:34.340
like a real flexible way.
Like your body gets opened up.

159
00:08:34.341 --> 00:08:39.200
Like they're doing these crazy things that are constantly stretching the tissue

160
00:08:39.201 --> 00:08:41.660
and pulling the tissue so everything has a

161
00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.590
<v 4>right,
everything has a purpose.
Like a,
you know,</v>

162
00:08:43.591 --> 00:08:45.570
a lot of people have back problems when they get older.

163
00:08:45.571 --> 00:08:49.650
Just the fact that you're bending your spine like that and then like certain,

164
00:08:49.651 --> 00:08:53.940
you know,
neck moves,
you're massaging your lymph nodes where people get cancer.

165
00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:56.040
I say I reach for a cigarette.

166
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.740
<v 3>Oh,
how dare you.
Yeah.
I think um,</v>

167
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.670
people carry a lot of tension in their muscle tissue and you know,

168
00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:05.490
if you just stretched,
even if you don't want to take a yoga class,

169
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.030
it sucks to just sit there and stretch.
But I'm telling you,

170
00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:12.690
if you did it just a little bit every day,
you'd feel more relaxed.

171
00:09:12.691 --> 00:09:15.810
It feels like you,
you alleviate some tension.

172
00:09:15.811 --> 00:09:20.100
Like your body's just got this fucking spring thing going on where everything's

173
00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:24.660
pulled in eight.
If you could just,
ah,
ah,

174
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:29.280
you'd literally physically makes you feel like you've alleviated some stress

175
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:33.550
just by pulling that muscle tissue apart.
And that's like we,
a lot of times we,

176
00:09:33.551 --> 00:09:35.190
we,
you know,
there's a lot of people,

177
00:09:35.191 --> 00:09:38.700
especially when you see people in traffic and road rage and freaking out for,

178
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:40.620
you know,
objective,
we nothing,

179
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:42.040
<v 4>we're ready.
That's always it.</v>

180
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.950
Like you'll be coming home from a yoga class and like,

181
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.370
you'll see you're driving and you're own mellow and there's people freaking out.

182
00:09:47.371 --> 00:09:49.210
You're like,
oh,
it doesn't even make sense.
Yeah,

183
00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:50.370
<v 3>it's a,
well,
what is that?
Well,</v>

184
00:09:50.371 --> 00:09:53.430
it's because this guy's got all this shit stored up inside of them.

185
00:09:53.431 --> 00:09:56.460
So anything is making them pop things,
making it pop.

186
00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:00.510
It's just failure after failure after fucking life.

187
00:10:00.511 --> 00:10:04.080
Shit's on them here and there and this fucking bitch.

188
00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:08.280
How could she say that and fucking get out of my fucking lane.
You know,

189
00:10:08.281 --> 00:10:12.360
you meet the guy,
he's already on nine before you even hit your blinker.
Yeah.

190
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:15.490
That's all the tanks.
You know,
you hit your pluck,
you fucking gone.

191
00:10:15.491 --> 00:10:17.480
You can't stay in your lane.
Exactly.
No,

192
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:21.780
he's in La is filled with those people are just so quick to blow there.

193
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.050
There's a space.
I'm not even cutting you off.
Crazy bitch.

194
00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:29.980
<v 4>I don't think I'll ever be on the cover of Yoga magazine.
Uh,
and I uh,</v>

195
00:10:29.981 --> 00:10:30.830
I saw your,

196
00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:33.950
<v 3>you're,
you're on the cover of fight your magazine.
Uh,
yeah.
I love to.</v>

197
00:10:33.951 --> 00:10:37.390
I read that piece.
It was great.
Yeah.
As a,
they're really nice guy.

198
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:42.740
I'm just a comedian that likes different things.
That's it.

199
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:45.290
I,
I'm not a real bad ass.

200
00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:48.080
I'm only a bad ass if you don't know how to fight it all.

201
00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.930
If you don't have to fight at all,
fuck you up.
But if you're good,

202
00:10:50.931 --> 00:10:55.790
you probably kicked my ass.
So it's not really a bad ass.
No.
You work for the UFC.

203
00:10:55.791 --> 00:10:59.800
You're constantly around like the elite of the elite fighters.

204
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:03.170
The world you want to talk about like Alpha males,
Geezer and we'll just,

205
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:08.240
you know,
assassins like Anderson Silva when you're around Anderson Silva.
Okay.

206
00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.900
And this the self as a very nice guy.
Very friendly guy.
Always happy.

207
00:11:11.901 --> 00:11:14.600
Very nice people.
But make no mistake about it.

208
00:11:14.601 --> 00:11:18.740
That motherfucker is a stone cold killer.
He's a killer.

209
00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:22.280
He's the greatest fight of that's ever walked the face of the earth when you're

210
00:11:22.281 --> 00:11:25.190
around.
I go,
that's some humbling shit man.
You know,

211
00:11:25.191 --> 00:11:30.191
you just know that that guy could light you up and there's not much you can do

212
00:11:30.621 --> 00:11:34.300
about it.
There's not much you can do about it.
I hope it ends quick.

213
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.000
<v 4>I've always loved boxing and you know,</v>

214
00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:39.750
it's amazingly easy like lightweights and stuff.
He sees these little guys,

215
00:11:39.751 --> 00:11:43.200
like if you,
you saw him on the street with like clothes on,
you'd probably think,

216
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:47.130
oh,
I can kick that guy's ass.
Yeah,
they're like the most vicious.

217
00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:50.580
<v 3>Oh,
you gotta like dry a favor.
Yeah,
you arrive favors not,
you know,</v>

218
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:54.280
he's a short guy,
but he's a fucking man.

219
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:59.050
<v 0>You know.
Any normal do 250 pound dude,
the fuck with your I favor,</v>

220
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:04.000
he'll get a hold of your neck,
man.
I don't care if he fights at one 45 or one 35,

221
00:12:04.001 --> 00:12:07.060
he gets a hold of your neck.
It's night night.
You know?
That's,
that's,

222
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.820
that's a crazy quality to have,
you know,
to be just like a,

223
00:12:10.821 --> 00:12:15.170
a human bulldog.
I know a lot of those dudes.
I know.
It's a,

224
00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.240
that's a various humbling,
very humbling thing.
It's,

225
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:21.610
it's fascinating too because you're watching the best that have ever been.

226
00:12:21.611 --> 00:12:24.490
Really.
It's like you're getting a chance to,
when I'm,

227
00:12:24.491 --> 00:12:27.250
when I show up at work and watch the UFC fights,

228
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:32.230
I'm getting a chance not just to watch like the best of today.
Unquestionably,

229
00:12:32.231 --> 00:12:34.840
the best martial artists that have ever existed.

230
00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.680
Like these are the best of the best ever.
This is like an epic,

231
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:43.720
like peak of activity where like the,
the,
the,
the technique and the like the,

232
00:12:43.721 --> 00:12:47.110
the,
uh,
the ability and the overall game of these fighters,

233
00:12:47.111 --> 00:12:50.800
it's so much better than it's ever been before.
It's like insane.
It's saying,

234
00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:54.580
it's saying how much it's evolved and grown just in like the past 10 years.

235
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:56.890
<v 4>Well,
it's amazing the effect it has on the United States.</v>

236
00:12:56.891 --> 00:12:59.650
Like you see bars that are just packed to the gills.

237
00:12:59.651 --> 00:13:03.970
You can't get in when the UFC is on and people think it's some Rome shits the

238
00:13:03.971 --> 00:13:07.560
phone,
it is totally wrong shit.
But you know what,

239
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.600
the people were very entertained in Rome.
You know,

240
00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:12.630
they never complained about the entertainment.
You know,

241
00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.710
the viaducts might've been leaky.

242
00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:17.950
It's funny that it's the oldest Ligia little poke you in the ass,

243
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.400
<v 0>but hey,
what his show,
you know,
look,</v>

244
00:13:20.401 --> 00:13:24.920
I will unapologetically if defend mixed martial arts to the end.

245
00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:29.820
Cause I love it.
It's fun to watch.
And for me,
uh,
you know,
if,
if we are evolving,

246
00:13:29.821 --> 00:13:33.480
it's not happening within my lifetime and I'm going to enjoy what I enjoy.
Sorry.

247
00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:35.460
You know,
people like doing it,

248
00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:39.300
they like doing it and people like watching it and that's all that matters to
me.

249
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:41.820
I know a lot of those people,
they're very nice people,

250
00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:45.210
but they have a calling and they're calling is to see how many people they can

251
00:13:45.211 --> 00:13:50.070
beat the fuck out of.
It's a crazy,
they're essentially playing a crazy game.

252
00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:54.450
<v 4>What does it mean throughout human history?
You know,
men fighting each other,
uh,</v>

253
00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:58.720
and showing who's the dominant fighter is timeless entertainment.

254
00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:03.700
It's why it's so weird that it's the oldest sport really that's ever existed I

255
00:14:03.701 --> 00:14:07.450
think.
I think,
I think,
uh,
uh,
a boxing was like one of the first Olympic sports.

256
00:14:07.451 --> 00:14:08.284
Yeah.

257
00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:11.060
<v 0>But fighting in general,
combat sports,</v>

258
00:14:11.061 --> 00:14:13.970
the idea of trying to take on another person physically.
The all,

259
00:14:13.971 --> 00:14:16.160
the only reason why,
I mean,

260
00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:20.750
it is the oldest form of competition between males for sure.

261
00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:24.320
And now it's the biggest and newest sport.

262
00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:28.010
Now in the current generation that doesn't even make any sense.

263
00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:31.730
It doesn't make any sense that it like didn't exist all along this time that it

264
00:14:31.731 --> 00:14:32.930
was only in limited farms.

265
00:14:32.931 --> 00:14:36.560
Like they like dribbled it out with boxing cause little kickboxing over here.

266
00:14:36.561 --> 00:14:38.110
They never,
nobody ever put everything in.

267
00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:42.820
<v 4>Why don't you guys did Thai boxing?
I was in Thailand years ago.
Uh,
you know,</v>

268
00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:47.760
it's interesting that Thailand is,
was never colonized.
All those other,
you know,

269
00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:52.100
Vietnam,
the French and all these different,
uh,
Asian countries been colonized,
but

270
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.120
<v 2>Thailand never was.</v>

271
00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:56.330
And I always thought it was because of the colonial white dudes came over there

272
00:14:56.331 --> 00:15:00.200
and saw Thai boxing.
Like,
fuck,
I don't want an Ni in the stomach.

273
00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.470
Will they have a weird way about them?

274
00:15:03.471 --> 00:15:07.430
Don't take the time they do the snake charmer dance at the beginning.

275
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:11.570
Do you ever been at Bangkok?
Man,
you go to the fights.
It's so great.
And it's,

276
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:14.160
they play that snake charmer music and they kind of,

277
00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:18.470
they're up on one foot and they're moving like a snake,
like a Cobra.

278
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:23.110
It's a wild dance and a acknowledge each other before they start swinging.
It's,

279
00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:28.250
well they not,
they don't just do that.
They also agree to start out slowly.

280
00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:31.100
They start out slowly in the first round.

281
00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:34.970
They don't attack like American fighters.
Like the bell rings,
they charge out.

282
00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:39.440
It's a tradition amongst the tie fighters to start slowly so that the bets can

283
00:15:39.441 --> 00:15:43.670
get in.
Oh Wow.
The first round knowledge nugget.

284
00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.990
The first round I was like a lot of this whack because that's,

285
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.760
there's still there.
Just as they got around it got real lazy.

286
00:15:49.761 --> 00:15:52.520
A bookkeeper in the window.
They don't really go for it.

287
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:55.800
Well you know there's a lot of bats like man he got it again,

288
00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:59.500
it's not like it started and you know more bets.
Well I think the bat,

289
00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:02.450
the line changes,
you know the bets are still coming in.

290
00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.060
They want to make sure that all the bets are in.
So they,
they get,

291
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:09.920
I'm sure they get instructed to fight at a very methodic pace for the first

292
00:16:09.921 --> 00:16:10.400
round.

293
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.700
The first round you don't open up too much in the second round of bets are in,

294
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:16.280
then it's time to go to war.
So most Thai fighters,

295
00:16:16.281 --> 00:16:19.700
they would have a disadvantage when they would fight in like k one because they

296
00:16:19.701 --> 00:16:21.980
weren't used to coming out of the gate guns blazing.

297
00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:25.460
They were used to letting this first round be sort of a setting.

298
00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.150
And if they're a drenched in blood,
they keep the fight going.
In Thailand,

299
00:16:29.151 --> 00:16:29.810
Thailand.
You know,

300
00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:32.900
there was a movie made I think about five years ago and it's a,

301
00:16:32.901 --> 00:16:37.300
it's a true story.
This guy tie fighter.
Uh,

302
00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:41.320
he used his winning prize money to have a sex Jess.

303
00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:45.200
And it was a little at a time.
So like,
you know,
he's,
he's half a woman,

304
00:16:45.201 --> 00:16:48.530
he's got the boobs on and he's still beating everybody's ass.

305
00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:53.390
And apparently when he got his testicles removed though,

306
00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:56.960
that's when it was night night when that guy,
that guy really beat my ass.

307
00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:01.100
I'm kind of attracted to him.
Yeah.

308
00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:06.140
I think he started losing once he became a full on woman once he got his nads

309
00:17:06.261 --> 00:17:08.720
cut out at once.
Yeah.
So it's,
you know,
hey Joe,

310
00:17:08.721 --> 00:17:12.030
a question about your fighters magazine cover.
I want it,

311
00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:15.920
you look like Cgi here for some reason.
What's up?
Is this,

312
00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:19.520
is this your head like photo shopped on somebody else's body or did you actually

313
00:17:19.521 --> 00:17:21.770
pose with the microphone like that?
Because isn't that weird?

314
00:17:21.771 --> 00:17:25.510
It looks like they just kind of pasted your head on somebody else's business.

315
00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:30.260
You know,
it looks like some Lee Harvey Oswald.
No,
that's just the shadow.

316
00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:33.320
That was a,
I was in the octagon.
Oh,
that's cool.

317
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:35.240
And they just put a camera right in front my face.

318
00:17:35.241 --> 00:17:36.740
He said I was standing on my corner.
I like this.

319
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:41.480
It looks like I'm kind of mean muggin and he looks CDI for side.

320
00:17:41.481 --> 00:17:43.910
There's a bunch of different ones.
I to the one bunch of me smiling,

321
00:17:43.911 --> 00:17:46.250
but that's the one they picked.
They picked it like,

322
00:17:46.251 --> 00:17:49.190
almost like the guy's smiling on the cover of lighters magazine.

323
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:55.770
<v 4>Silly.
I like the pictures on the inside.
Is that your pad?
The House?
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

324
00:17:55.771 --> 00:17:58.200
I have um,
for never invite me out.

325
00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:03.950
<v 2>Time rides.
Right.
I don't like swimming.
I don't like hot dogs.</v>

326
00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:07.400
<v 4>You know how much I love hotdogs.
Oh yeah.</v>

327
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.570
This is a picture of your gym inside that,
uh,

328
00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:13.440
that great shot.

329
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:16.230
<v 2>Yeah.
I got a gym that's like set up like a,</v>

330
00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:19.410
it's like a cage and a zebra mats.

331
00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:21.620
<v 4>That's a great show.
That's a,
wow.</v>

332
00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:27.860
So it's like this,
um,
it's like a full MMA gym.

333
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:32.760
<v 2>That's an old stripper movies there,
isn't it?
I'm trying to get sexy right there.</v>

334
00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:35.430
You'd be a great stripper.
I just realized I'd be okay,

335
00:18:35.431 --> 00:18:39.200
but I'm lazy like Magic Mike,
Charlie Hustle.
I wouldn't be,
I would be like,

336
00:18:39.201 --> 00:18:43.590
do you want to answer whatever your Tomo and you kind of shattered that thing.

337
00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.540
I always thought like guys with muscles weren't funny.

338
00:18:45.541 --> 00:18:47.220
Like comedians like guys who were really like,

339
00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.840
but you're like funny and you talk about life thought that too political things

340
00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.900
and um,
you know,
we should never conceived notion.

341
00:18:54.901 --> 00:18:57.900
I had about muscle guys top knocked it out of the park,

342
00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:04.440
you know,
ma'am,
me and CT,
we saw about breaking boundaries.
Who's all about Sam?

343
00:19:04.441 --> 00:19:07.560
Precedence was all about milestones.
You know what I'm saying?

344
00:19:07.561 --> 00:19:12.040
Watermarks high watermark.
Me and CT,
we go where we go way back.

345
00:19:12.041 --> 00:19:14.880
Love Care Top.
He's,
he's from Florida

346
00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:18.100
<v 4>and uh,
I saw him in Vegas like two weeks ago.
He's not as,</v>

347
00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.690
he's not as buff as he was.
He kind of,

348
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:25.330
he's like a really good shape is not that bulging like,
um,
he was,

349
00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:29.230
he got a little crazy and then he brought it down.
Really good guy.
Yeah.
Yeah,

350
00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:32.860
I've heard that from whatever to whatever.
It makes people laugh,
you know,

351
00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:37.000
is a good thing.
Uh,
I hate,
I hate snobby Comedians,
you know what I mean?

352
00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:41.140
I do as well.
Motherfuckers got problems in this world and uh,

353
00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:46.000
my father,
um,
who's passed now,
uh,
years ago,

354
00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:50.610
I got tickets for us to see the rolling stones at the MGM in Vegas.
I don't,

355
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:53.480
it was like 10,
15 years ago and,
uh,

356
00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:56.440
something screwed up with the tickets at will call.
And we're like,
I'm like,

357
00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:57.760
oh my God,
you know,

358
00:19:57.761 --> 00:20:01.300
and we came all the way to Vegas and with my dad we wouldn't sell carrot top.

359
00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.680
And you know,
one of my,
uh,
my,

360
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:06.640
my dad is the reason I'm a comedian and he had comedy albums.
He took me to like,

361
00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:10.210
Oh really?
First comedy show and you know,
now that my dad has passed,

362
00:20:10.211 --> 00:20:13.570
that's one of my favorite memories is,
is thinking about sitting with him.

363
00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:17.440
You know,
my dad's drinking is a little rusty nail cocktails and you know,

364
00:20:17.441 --> 00:20:21.400
thinking about him laughing at carrot top shit.
That's awesome.
Right.

365
00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:25.480
That's beautiful.
You know,
it was super buff.
Nowadays.
Is that Dave Chappelle?

366
00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:27.450
Yeah,
I saw him other

367
00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:31.020
<v 2>day at the comedy store and it's just scary how strong that guy.</v>

368
00:20:31.021 --> 00:20:33.960
But he was doing MMA but I never heard like online,

369
00:20:33.961 --> 00:20:36.540
like there's a gym or someone was training with Dave Chappelle.

370
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:40.260
I never heard of any of that.
But yeah.
Yeah,
I think that's awesome.

371
00:20:40.261 --> 00:20:42.930
Dave was always like really skinny.
I guess he got tired of that shit.

372
00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.170
I want to be able to fuck people up.

373
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:49.420
<v 0>Why not?
Yeah.</v>

374
00:20:49.421 --> 00:20:52.900
The idea that you know you have to be fat or you have to be skinny or you have

375
00:20:52.901 --> 00:20:53.620
to be muscular.

376
00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:57.790
You have either think funny or you don't think funny if you either,
you know,

377
00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:02.080
put invest time into it and treat it like it's an art for me.
You don't,

378
00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:04.090
it doesn't matter if you have any muscles that's silly.

379
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:07.600
How many hours a day do you spend?
Like writing comedy,

380
00:21:07.601 --> 00:21:11.430
you don't have 40 minutes to go out,
you know?
Right.
You know,

381
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.940
you don't have an hour here or there.

382
00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:17.240
<v 4>Right.
In that old model of like the,
the,
the alcoholic comedian,</v>

383
00:21:17.241 --> 00:21:20.490
it didn't take care of himself.
I mean of the 80s,
you know,
that,
uh,

384
00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:22.340
I don't like those people have all died.

385
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:26.120
<v 0>Yeah.
And they didn't look like they were having a good time at the end.
You know,</v>

386
00:21:26.121 --> 00:21:29.600
that that alcoholic life is a tough,
tough life,
you know,
dominant.

387
00:21:29.601 --> 00:21:34.400
Where a good friend of mine,
uh,
recently quit.
I quit for like 17,

388
00:21:34.401 --> 00:21:37.520
18 days.
He hasn't had a drink.
And you know,

389
00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:41.720
he's just talking on the podcast yesterday we did the icehouse chronicles and he

390
00:21:41.721 --> 00:21:45.230
was just talking about how great he feels and it's amazing to wake up and not

391
00:21:45.231 --> 00:21:49.910
have a hangover.
He was planning for hangovers.
He would like schedule flights.

392
00:21:49.911 --> 00:21:51.860
Like I don't want to get up there and I'll be over.

393
00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:56.050
Like he knew he was going to feel like shit and he said it just the 16,
70 days,

394
00:21:56.051 --> 00:21:57.050
he goes,
I feel sharp.

395
00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:00.380
<v 4>I took a break from drinking for the month of March.
And uh,</v>

396
00:22:00.381 --> 00:22:05.120
it was remarkable how sharp I was on stage and how clear minded,
you know,

397
00:22:05.121 --> 00:22:06.680
without having a beer too.

398
00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:09.940
<v 0>Yeah.
Well the body is a fucking machine man.</v>

399
00:22:09.941 --> 00:22:13.060
And when you throw some shit in it that it has to deal with,
you know,

400
00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:16.030
<v 4>but you know,
you get older and you know your body changes.
You know what I mean?</v>

401
00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:16.431
You know,

402
00:22:16.431 --> 00:22:19.670
everybody can remember when you're younger and you could just get plastered at a

403
00:22:19.671 --> 00:22:23.690
party and then wake up the next day and help a friend move and then play

404
00:22:23.691 --> 00:22:25.430
softball in the afternoon.
It was,

405
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:28.420
<v 0>we have a theory about that and I think that when you're younger,</v>

406
00:22:28.421 --> 00:22:30.970
you're less aware of your body.

407
00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:34.330
You're less aware of the consequences of being exhausted.

408
00:22:34.331 --> 00:22:36.190
You less aware of what you've done when you,

409
00:22:36.191 --> 00:22:40.270
you poison yourself and you fucking wake up hung over.
When you get older,

410
00:22:40.271 --> 00:22:41.290
you know what you did.

411
00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:45.140
And so when you get older you really accept it and think about it and dwell on

412
00:22:45.141 --> 00:22:45.400
it.

413
00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.350
<v 4>Well,
I could barely leave the bad nowadays.</v>

414
00:22:47.351 --> 00:22:50.110
I never used to have that problem where you like get up and you're just like

415
00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:54.520
holy shit,
I just need to go back to bed and call this day off because it's been,

416
00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.550
I've never had that when I was 21 you know you've got to get in shape kid.

417
00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:01.490
You have to.
I know,
I mean it sounds,
it sounds ridiculous.

418
00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:04.840
Just need to not drink that hard.
It's getting in shape vape

419
00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:07.950
<v 0>as well.
You've got to have a body that's resilient.
You want,</v>

420
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000
you want your body to have the least some like day to day effort.

421
00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:16.560
You want it to be fighting things off,
pushing things,
pulling things,

422
00:23:16.561 --> 00:23:19.680
doing something where your body feels the need to be vital,

423
00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:23.490
to have vitality and that that's like your body.

424
00:23:23.491 --> 00:23:28.260
You have to think of your whole thing as one unit and if you look at it as one

425
00:23:28.261 --> 00:23:28.860
unit,

426
00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:32.730
if one part of it is like to attracting resources cause it's all fucking falling

427
00:23:32.731 --> 00:23:35.510
apart and fucked up and shit and it's all kinked,

428
00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:39.510
twisted and it's not used correctly,
it's never been stretched out.

429
00:23:39.511 --> 00:23:43.280
That's going to give you problems.
It's going to cause you resources like you,

430
00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:45.380
you're the,
your thoughts won't be as clear.

431
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:49.250
Your ideas won't be as concise because you're going to be dealing with this

432
00:23:49.251 --> 00:23:50.900
fucked up body.
I always think like,

433
00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:54.140
I meet brilliant people that have fucked up bodies and I'm like,

434
00:23:54.141 --> 00:23:56.930
imagine how brilliant his mother fucker would be if he just took care of his

435
00:23:56.931 --> 00:23:57.510
health as well.

436
00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:01.590
<v 2>Well,
right.
Well,
you know,
I'm,
I would never purchase such a thing.
Uh,</v>

437
00:24:01.591 --> 00:24:05.730
but a friend of mine,
his mother got divorced,
uh,
years ago and he had like,

438
00:24:05.731 --> 00:24:10.320
he had some boxes of her shit and on the top of it was,
uh,

439
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:13.770
one of those Anthony Robbins courses.

440
00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:17.100
I forget which one it was.
Um,
you know,

441
00:24:17.101 --> 00:24:21.970
sees the whatever opportunity,
you know.
Um,

442
00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.770
but it would be your own unit.
You know,
I,
I listened to these,
uh,

443
00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.650
these like eight discs,
these cds.
It was the course,

444
00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:32.820
and it's though his whole thing is you should start your day exercising.

445
00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:37.440
Even if you're a fat fuck,
just get up and walk a half hour,
whatever.

446
00:24:37.441 --> 00:24:41.580
You should always start your day exercising because when you exercise you like

447
00:24:41.581 --> 00:24:46.581
kind of omit this energy and people want to do business with you because you

448
00:24:47.191 --> 00:24:49.710
appear healthy and that you know,

449
00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.470
even if it's just the absolute bare minimum,

450
00:24:52.471 --> 00:24:57.210
and that was like his whole thing that he kept going back to throughout this a

451
00:24:57.330 --> 00:25:00.620
business course weights,
you can force your bone and your day is,

452
00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:05.280
your day is already a victory.
Yes,
you've already won because you worked out,

453
00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.490
you didn't want to you to walk for a half hour.

454
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:10.380
Your Day is a victory and how much of life is momentum?

455
00:25:10.381 --> 00:25:12.150
It's about getting your shit together for a little while.

456
00:25:12.151 --> 00:25:15.090
We feel like things are going great and then it feels like things are going to

457
00:25:15.091 --> 00:25:19.740
continue along those lines.
It's about getting the ball rolling right.
It's about,

458
00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:23.190
it's about trying to just,
just a little bit of victory,

459
00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:27.450
a little bit of moving forward and it feels like once things get going in that

460
00:25:27.451 --> 00:25:31.190
direction,
you can kind of make them go in that direction.
Take control.

461
00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:35.850
Bitches can take control of your own destiny.
Let's start a yoga class.

462
00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:40.530
I'm not very good and I feel like watching visionquest the problem with yoga is

463
00:25:40.531 --> 00:25:41.850
if you're married like I am,

464
00:25:41.851 --> 00:25:44.470
there's too many hot bitches sticking their asses up in the warehouse.

465
00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:49.490
Yoga pants on and that's just for Ronica is taking yoga training classes in San

466
00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:51.150
Diego

467
00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:56.100
<v 0>talking about c p Penthouse pad.
It's not what you need.
That's not what you need.</v>

468
00:25:56.220 --> 00:26:00.410
Bending over in front of you in a Hob bonks in the hot box where everybody's

469
00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:02.630
dripping,
everybody was all sweat.
It's like a

470
00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:04.140
<v 2>fucking better than Michael's video.</v>

471
00:26:04.141 --> 00:26:06.960
Better than running on a treadmill watching television.
Yeah it is.

472
00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:10.040
But she said that there was like,
she skipped a class.

473
00:26:10.041 --> 00:26:13.940
She like went and like I escaped one of the classes because they all started

474
00:26:13.941 --> 00:26:16.370
talking about like spirits is she,

475
00:26:16.371 --> 00:26:20.060
is she a ate a Brownie before she did it thinking I was just going to be yoga

476
00:26:20.061 --> 00:26:21.810
training and so,
uh,

477
00:26:21.811 --> 00:26:25.040
then she said that the woman sat there for an hour and talk about like spirits

478
00:26:25.041 --> 00:26:26.490
and like all this other crazy,

479
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:30.980
I forget the kind of yoga it is or that the PR what we know Makenna okay.

480
00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:36.270
<v 0>He's said that he believed that yoga was a method for using cannabis,</v>

481
00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:40.270
that it was a,
a method for,
uh,

482
00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:44.250
exploring cannabis and that it was to be co

483
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.470
<v 2>it's supposed to coincide with the use of marijuana,</v>

484
00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:48.930
either smoking hash or eating hash,

485
00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:51.900
and that that's what these crazy poses were all about.

486
00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:56.370
It's all about achieving these like enlightened states of consciousness.
Why,

487
00:26:56.371 --> 00:27:00.540
why under the extreme influence of edible cannabis?
Yeah.

488
00:27:00.541 --> 00:27:03.610
She tripped out and said,
well,
if you ever done yoga side,

489
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:06.660
have you ever done yoga?
Hi.
No,
I haven't.
It's amazing,

490
00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.510
but she might as well be astral traveling.
It's,

491
00:27:09.511 --> 00:27:12.630
it'll be like a psychedelic experience.
Go to a hot yoga class,

492
00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:16.950
get get super duper baked and go to a hot yoga class.
Holy Shit.

493
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:18.420
Oh my God.
Yeah.

494
00:27:18.421 --> 00:27:22.140
You'll have a fucking psychedelic experience or ideas to start teaching yoga

495
00:27:22.141 --> 00:27:24.500
with her height,
penthouse friends.
Oh,

496
00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.360
that's going to turn into a horror house.

497
00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:32.730
Take one hour after they open before the first guy comes in with a stack of

498
00:27:32.731 --> 00:27:37.140
cash.
Right.
And then it's on Yoga.

499
00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:42.420
The Fuck Outta here.
And what do they do a little short term?
Crazy bitch

500
00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:47.550
naked yoga.
Did they do that?
Well,
the these girls would do it.
Wow.

501
00:27:47.551 --> 00:27:50.750
Naked Yoga class.
Jesus Christ.
It's going to be a fucking origin.

502
00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:52.590
Yoga was going to pay for the kids.

503
00:27:52.591 --> 00:27:56.070
You can go to India and do it like among temples and shit that I deal with

504
00:27:56.071 --> 00:28:01.071
annoying people step over like dying children and I would totally be willing to

505
00:28:02.071 --> 00:28:07.020
do that except I know too many fucking yoga people and too many yoga people

506
00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:07.301
there.

507
00:28:07.301 --> 00:28:12.301
They're trying to reverse what they used to be and they struggle and they don't

508
00:28:12.631 --> 00:28:17.340
quite get it right and they claim to be all beads and roses and the,

509
00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:20.010
but if you get involved in a business deal with those kinds,

510
00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:24.450
they will try to fuck you.
Really young people I've had,
yeah,

511
00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:29.730
I'm very recent situation stating that yoga people are unethical business that I

512
00:28:29.731 --> 00:28:34.530
think that a lot of yoga people are legit.
A lot of young people are legit,

513
00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:35.371
no question about it.

514
00:28:35.371 --> 00:28:39.600
I've met some really fascinating people that were like addicted to yoga and how

515
00:28:39.601 --> 00:28:42.810
it changed their personality and offered them a new perspective.

516
00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:47.490
I think yoga is very psychedelic in that way.
But I also know a lot of creepy,

517
00:28:47.491 --> 00:28:51.720
fake philosophical motherfuckers do yoga.
Well,

518
00:28:51.721 --> 00:28:54.630
I mean you got to California factor too.
I mean,
uh,
you know,

519
00:28:54.631 --> 00:28:58.490
there's a cute little cute little beak.
I'm yoga in Orlando that I go to,
it's,

520
00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:02.430
and a,
it's run by lesbians who it's really cheerful and,
uh,

521
00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:03.870
they used to be in a small place.

522
00:29:03.871 --> 00:29:07.680
Now they're in a bigger place and I'm proud of them.
Well,
listen,
I love Yoga.

523
00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:11.850
I'm not saying there's anything wrong with yoga.
That is a little cultish though.

524
00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:16.470
It gets a little cult like,
gets a little yoga,
like,
oh my family,

525
00:29:16.471 --> 00:29:18.870
when I told them I was doing yoga,
they thought I had joined a call.

526
00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:22.440
There's a lot of people that think that that's such an alien idea that,

527
00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:27.000
oh my God,
they must be like living in a commune.
And when I say it's called like,

528
00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:31.200
I'm choking.
Totally.
But the idea of,
you know,

529
00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:35.700
this like aspired mindset,
you know,
this yoga mindset,
no,
my stay,

530
00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:40.050
you know,
there's no,
you know what I mean?
There's like sort of like you're,

531
00:29:40.051 --> 00:29:42.190
you're,
you've adopted this sort of yoga

532
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:45.850
<v 0>thing.
There's this w and that's when I know you're struggling to get your shit</v>

533
00:29:45.851 --> 00:29:49.960
together,
Dude.
Okay.
And I love that this is what you're aspiring to,

534
00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:52.480
but you're not totally there yet.
You're still kind of creepy.

535
00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:56.770
You still kind of full of shit and there's a lot more of those guys.

536
00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.990
There's a lot more of those like faith.
There was a dude,

537
00:29:58.991 --> 00:30:01.030
he used to teach yoga class.

538
00:30:01.031 --> 00:30:06.031
I used to go do this guy was from South Africa and really friendly like clean

539
00:30:06.941 --> 00:30:09.850
guy,
open guy.
It was totally legit.

540
00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:13.690
And he would say things that wouldn't even be remotely Corny,

541
00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:18.940
say things that were,
you know,
just a,
a different,
unique way to look at your day.

542
00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:21.700
Different unique ways to look at people that you came in contact with.

543
00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:23.830
That guy was 100% legit.

544
00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:28.120
Always very even in friendly and very,
very kind to people.

545
00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:31.870
And the ready for this,
he operated his class on donations.

546
00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:33.670
You didn't even have to pay.

547
00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:37.330
You could go and take his class for free and it's in fucking Calabasas.
Okay.

548
00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:41.920
This is a really super expensive place and these I would watch these rich

549
00:30:41.921 --> 00:30:44.530
housewives go in and not even put money on.
Wow.

550
00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:46.720
They would just go in because it was afraid they would just do it.

551
00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:48.450
Oh I didn't have any cash.
I mean whatever,
you know,

552
00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:50.350
I mean whatever the fuck their rationale was.

553
00:30:50.351 --> 00:30:53.710
But you know a lot of people pay them cause it was,
it was so good.

554
00:30:53.711 --> 00:30:57.790
It was so legit.
So there are guys like that.
But there was another dude that I,

555
00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:00.100
that I knew that I was teaching yoga that was banging.

556
00:31:00.101 --> 00:31:04.960
This guy's wife was taking classes there and he was just constantly like making

557
00:31:04.961 --> 00:31:05.780
the moves on different

558
00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:09.890
<v 2>dude's wives had constantly late and they eventually kicked him out of the</v>

559
00:31:09.891 --> 00:31:12.110
community.
But I mean there's those guys,

560
00:31:12.111 --> 00:31:15.770
here's those fake bead wear and assholes.
When Lotus Flower Tattoo,

561
00:31:15.771 --> 00:31:20.080
I noticed you were looking for an afternoon hobby.
Yeah,
they were like,

562
00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:22.830
like predators on dudes wives and shit.
Well it's funny,

563
00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:27.020
it's like when you see a guy acting like a dick,
a in a Bob Marley tee shirt,

564
00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:30.650
you're like,
you've missed something here,
sir.
All of it.

565
00:31:30.651 --> 00:31:32.570
You've missed all of this.
Something about that,

566
00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:35.290
<v 0>about the program.
Well unfortunately man,</v>

567
00:31:35.291 --> 00:31:39.820
for these people that we see out there that are retarded in this world,

568
00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:41.830
they were raised by retarded people.

569
00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:45.040
I don't think they were raised by really compassionate,

570
00:31:45.041 --> 00:31:49.360
interested parents who really put a lot of work into raising them and giving

571
00:31:49.361 --> 00:31:52.240
them values and they were set loose like wild animals.

572
00:31:52.241 --> 00:31:55.930
So it's like an aberration.
It's a fuckup.
It's a glitch,
you know?

573
00:31:55.940 --> 00:32:00.070
And that you almost can't even make them responsible for it.
They're so stupid,

574
00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:00.911
you know?
That's,

575
00:32:00.911 --> 00:32:04.690
that's the big majority of the population were raised by idiocracy.

576
00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.550
And you think we're heading to now?

577
00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.530
I want her in the fields with the electrolytes.

578
00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:12.340
I think there's always going to be a certain when when we ignore the social

579
00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:16.600
aspects of like social planning and like the social aspects of like the fact

580
00:32:16.601 --> 00:32:18.220
that you have to deal with all these poor people,

581
00:32:18.221 --> 00:32:19.690
these poor people live amongst you.

582
00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:22.870
And just cause we've managed to isolate them in the areas where it's not

583
00:32:22.871 --> 00:32:24.510
expensive to live.
It doesn't,

584
00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:27.550
I mean this is ridiculous that you would allow such disparity.

585
00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:31.900
There's obviously something wrong with the system.
If there's people like that.

586
00:32:31.901 --> 00:32:35.170
It is an education thing.
It is a discipline thing.

587
00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:37.720
It is a like a tradition thing.

588
00:32:37.721 --> 00:32:41.930
I mean if you have a tradition of in your world and you're surrounded by
failure,

589
00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:47.000
it almost breeds failure.
And I think as a social engineering a plan,
they,

590
00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:47.930
the government,

591
00:32:47.931 --> 00:32:50.990
if they were going to do anything right would look at that and figure out before

592
00:32:50.991 --> 00:32:54.800
we fuck with other countries we have to figure out this little thing right here.

593
00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.600
<v 4>We've got to figure out how to,
how to stop this cycle.</v>

594
00:32:58.320 --> 00:32:59.910
I Dunno the dumber you are,
the better you serve.

595
00:32:59.911 --> 00:33:04.170
Capitalisms so you know there's a lot of low level jobs that need to be filled.

596
00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:07.440
I think that's horse shit cause I think that's pussy capitalism.

597
00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:10.000
I think that's like fake competition.
I think

598
00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:14.040
<v 0>it was all done with honor and it was all done under,
if,
forgive myself,</v>

599
00:33:14.041 --> 00:33:15.510
repeating myself cause I say this all the time,

600
00:33:15.511 --> 00:33:20.190
but we should have like a real simple ethic,
you know,
don't be a fucking asshole,

601
00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:24.210
don't be a cunt.
Really simple make money but don't be a cunt if you,

602
00:33:24.211 --> 00:33:26.280
as long as you can get people to follow that.

603
00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:29.020
<v 4>That was Jesus as his whole message should be.
Don't be a dick.</v>

604
00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:32.800
That's all of Jesus's teachings condensed into one.
But yeah,

605
00:33:32.801 --> 00:33:36.190
I don't know why the,
you know,
American government can't figure out that like,

606
00:33:36.191 --> 00:33:38.730
you know,
better educated people who have,
you know,

607
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:40.930
health care would be better workers,

608
00:33:40.931 --> 00:33:44.080
better inventors that we would be,
you know,

609
00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:46.450
better competitors in the global market.
If I'm,

610
00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:49.050
the problem is if we gave a hand up to some of these

611
00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:53.080
<v 0>poor people.
Yeah,
you're right.
The problem is everybody short term,</v>

612
00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:55.361
you know,

613
00:33:55.361 --> 00:33:58.750
it's like everybody's thinking about themselves and profiting in the short term

614
00:33:58.751 --> 00:34:01.720
and then the investors that got them in the office,
they want a profit quickly,

615
00:34:01.721 --> 00:34:02.554
quickly,
quickly.

616
00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:07.360
Nobody wants to like build up and spend a lot of money to build up parts of the

617
00:34:07.361 --> 00:34:07.691
country.

618
00:34:07.691 --> 00:34:10.960
That doesn't mean who's going to benefit poor people who don't even contribute

619
00:34:10.961 --> 00:34:14.950
to the campaign or you don't.
We don't think of them as a resource.
You know,

620
00:34:14.951 --> 00:34:18.340
it's just fascinating because,
you know,
we're trying to,
you know,

621
00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.920
trying to find new places to drill into the ground to get oil.
But we,

622
00:34:21.921 --> 00:34:26.921
we totally ignore the most important resource for changing the world that the

623
00:34:27.671 --> 00:34:30.160
universe has ever seen.
The human brain,

624
00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:34.720
we have millions of ignored,
potential geniuses,

625
00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:36.670
potential world changers,

626
00:34:36.671 --> 00:34:41.671
potential unique minds and million of them cast loose in the jungle of despair.

627
00:34:42.341 --> 00:34:45.790
That is poor communities.
I mean,
if you want it to look at a resource,

628
00:34:45.791 --> 00:34:49.480
there's no fucking greater resource than,
than people at the bottom of the,

629
00:34:49.481 --> 00:34:53.590
of the food chain in,
in culture,
those,
that's the greatest resource ever.

630
00:34:53.591 --> 00:34:58.510
Human beings like you have the,
if we wanted to make the world better,
it's,

631
00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:03.220
it's,
it seems like you would have to fix the base.
You have to fix the bottom.

632
00:35:03.221 --> 00:35:06.550
What's the broken part?
You gonna fix that Shit.
You know,

633
00:35:06.551 --> 00:35:09.160
and people's a blue fuck.
Pull yourself up by your bootstraps.

634
00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:12.060
<v 4>You got to learn how to do that.
You know you can't just,</v>

635
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:13.560
I know the baby in the woods.

636
00:35:13.561 --> 00:35:16.550
I love the all the rich white people complaining about the occupy movement.

637
00:35:16.551 --> 00:35:21.060
I was like,
why can't you just get a job and oh my God,
do the American dream.

638
00:35:21.061 --> 00:35:24.810
It's always to anybody can do whatever they want.

639
00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:29.000
Did you see Giuliani say that Giuliani to some speech reason?
You know?

640
00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:33.840
How about you occupy a chop?
How about you go to open mic night?

641
00:35:33.841 --> 00:35:37.950
You had,
you know he was fucking high five his when

642
00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:41.460
<v 2>they came up with that one.
Yeah,
they were fucking psyched.
He nailed it.</v>

643
00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:44.610
He nailed it.
He hit the line and they're on their phones.
He hit the line.

644
00:35:44.611 --> 00:35:46.830
It was brilliant.
Perfect timing.
The audience went nuts.

645
00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:50.760
I just loved that white people were surprised that there's some unhappy people

646
00:35:50.761 --> 00:35:51.600
in this country.

647
00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:55.500
<v 3>Ian Edwards has a fucking great bit about it and I don't want to paraphrase,</v>

648
00:35:55.501 --> 00:35:58.590
but about how more people,

649
00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:01.800
everybody's been robbed by white dudes in suits.

650
00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:06.180
Everybody like people are afraid of black people but white dudes in suits

651
00:36:06.181 --> 00:36:09.960
including blah.
It's really fucking funny,
but so God damn true.

652
00:36:09.961 --> 00:36:14.310
Like how could they be surprised that anybody would be mad that like where does

653
00:36:14.311 --> 00:36:15.420
bail out?
What's going on?

654
00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:19.530
Like trillions of what the fuck happened and where did it go?
What?

655
00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:21.180
It doesn't even make any sense.

656
00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:26.030
You look at the numbers that they talk about like you know at 13 trillion,

657
00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:28.700
what are,
where is that coming from?

658
00:36:28.701 --> 00:36:32.600
You're just making this up like this isn't even a real thing is passing around

659
00:36:32.601 --> 00:36:35.930
some some new number like what the fuck are you doing?

660
00:36:35.931 --> 00:36:38.510
Like where's this even coming from?
It doesn't even make sense.

661
00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:44.420
$13 trillion.
What?
That doesn't even make sense to me.
I can't,

662
00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:49.430
I can't wrap my head around more than than than $100,000 or something like that.

663
00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:51.380
Anything more than a hundred thousand dollars I'm like,

664
00:36:51.381 --> 00:36:55.100
what is going on out there?
I can't see that far.
It doesn't even make any sense.

665
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:58.940
It says it doesn't seem real.
13 trillion.
It's like stop it.

666
00:36:58.970 --> 00:37:03.110
That's not even a real number.
That can't be a real,
we end.
Where did it go?

667
00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:08.330
What the fuck is going on?
You did what with it?
It doesn't make any sense.

668
00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:11.840
It seems like there's no way that she'd ever be able to happen.

669
00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:15.740
The system should be what?
It should never be.
That money can just disappear.

670
00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:17.070
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

671
00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:19.620
<v 2>She never be that like the fucking,
well sorry the shit.</v>

672
00:37:19.621 --> 00:37:22.850
It's not worth anything anymore.
It was all going to tumble down now and then

673
00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:25.770
<v 3>houses are going to stop appreciating and like what?</v>

674
00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:28.950
What can a wacky fucking system where we were running and we running a

675
00:37:28.951 --> 00:37:29.910
confidence game,

676
00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:32.800
<v 2>right?
Well we believed in the value of things that weren't worth that.</v>

677
00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:34.180
That's where it gets really crazy.

678
00:37:34.181 --> 00:37:36.010
When people were buying houses and then they were like,

679
00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:39.050
there was like a little crappy,
you know,
drywall,

680
00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:42.700
stucco places going for like five hundred thousand seven hundred thousand and

681
00:37:42.701 --> 00:37:44.170
there were like 150

682
00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:47.270
<v 3>best,
especially in La man.</v>

683
00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:50.240
I've had friends that bought like in in La and you're like,

684
00:37:50.241 --> 00:37:54.530
you're out of your mind man.
Like you're like in the belly of the beast.

685
00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:58.380
You're going to get the shittiest price for your,
or you know,

686
00:37:58.430 --> 00:38:01.460
for buying something,
like why would you want to live like that?

687
00:38:01.461 --> 00:38:02.810
Stuffed in there like that.

688
00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:04.210
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

689
00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:08.110
<v 3>La is the weirdest kind of city too,
because it's really spread out.</v>

690
00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:11.770
It never built up because the whole earthquake thing ever.
But it was like,

691
00:38:11.771 --> 00:38:15.190
listen,
let's just fucking,
you know,
two stories is good.

692
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.170
If one of these things come tumbling down,
you see those,
um,

693
00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:24.520
those high rises and they're like downtown La,
they just stand out like a giant.

694
00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:26.790
<v 2>I'll tell you what's weird about La is the downtown.</v>

695
00:38:26.791 --> 00:38:29.790
There's some really magnificent old buildings down there.
And like this one,

696
00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:34.430
it had,
was a real,
uh,
vibrant,
actual downtown.
Yeah.
Uh,

697
00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:36.010
pointing at that one point in time and

698
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:40.970
<v 4>now it looks like Omega Man.
It's just like,
you know,
people don't bs and,
uh,</v>

699
00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:46.520
<v 3>um,
you know,
homeless,
crazy,
crazy people.
People don't even realize how bad it is.</v>

700
00:38:46.521 --> 00:38:48.560
We,
we've talked about it so many times on this show.

701
00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:50.570
You really almost have to go there to see it.

702
00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:54.090
<v 4>Right.
But I don't understand.
I mean,
especially all these great buildings,</v>

703
00:38:54.091 --> 00:38:57.750
why people don't just like move back downtown and no,
there is a movement.

704
00:38:57.810 --> 00:38:58.590
There's,
yeah,

705
00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:01.810
I know there's some lofts down there and lots of people moving downtown.

706
00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:04.900
<v 3>Well there's a lot of new shit that's opening up downtown.</v>

707
00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:07.090
<v 6>There's a really cool night nightlife to like,</v>

708
00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:11.590
like there's a lot of good bars and a lot of good restaurants and it's,

709
00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:16.180
I've been hanging out more downtown lately and it's really cool,

710
00:39:16.181 --> 00:39:19.480
but it is still just too mixed up.
There's not,

711
00:39:19.850 --> 00:39:22.660
there's not a good border of,
hey,

712
00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:26.560
don't walk down this street because you'll die and this street's cool to walk

713
00:39:26.561 --> 00:39:30.570
down.
I went the wrong direction out of,
there's a comedy club that I,

714
00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:35.380
I did a spot at and I went the wrong direction back to my car and it was like

715
00:39:35.381 --> 00:39:38.980
the scariest fucking street in the whole entire room and like halfway down the

716
00:39:38.981 --> 00:39:41.800
street I'm like,
Oh,
this is the wrong street.
And then rent,
I turn around,

717
00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:44.590
there's like all these people like behind me walk and I'm like,
Oh shit,

718
00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:47.160
what the fuck is this?
It's straight out of boys.
In the or,

719
00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:50.360
<v 4>you gotta be ready to hit that a show at your son.
You gotta be ready to,</v>

720
00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:52.100
I slept no fly over your hood.

721
00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:55.180
I stayed in a hotel down there a few weeks ago and there's a,
it was a real

722
00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:59.910
<v 3>cool punk rock bar on,
was this Linwood?
Something like that?</v>

723
00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:03.450
Hmm.
No,
I'm talking about,
no,
I don't know.
Punk rock bar,
something would,

724
00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:07.180
we did a lot of fear factor shit down there in downtown La and

725
00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:12.620
<v 4>there's lots of space you can in a lot of old don't a water cannon on the</v>

726
00:40:12.621 --> 00:40:15.780
homeless.
People in the streets,
yards.
There's a lot of them.

727
00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:19.510
<v 3>The old buildings that they uh,
you know,
there's a lot of like,</v>

728
00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:23.190
like tie and zip lines through and stuff.
Well it's weird.
Like you,

729
00:40:23.191 --> 00:40:27.610
you go to these old buildings in downtown La and you'll go to like the first two

730
00:40:27.611 --> 00:40:31.900
floors,
it'll be like an American apparel factory and there'll be like working,

731
00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:34.810
making jeans and shit and it's real weird.

732
00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:38.560
And then you keep walking through there and then above that it's completely

733
00:40:38.561 --> 00:40:43.510
abandoned.
Just dust all over concrete floors,
broken windows.

734
00:40:43.511 --> 00:40:47.140
It's really bizarre.
It's like you'll have a 10 story building,

735
00:40:47.141 --> 00:40:49.270
but you only have two stories that are occupied.

736
00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:53.350
And then we would put up some fucking contraption on the roof and sling people

737
00:40:53.351 --> 00:40:56.620
off the side of the shit.
I mean,
that was with,
uh,
the show.

738
00:40:56.621 --> 00:40:58.270
We did that a lot in downtown la,
but

739
00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:00.660
<v 4>it's just weird factor is no longer on the air.</v>

740
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:04.600
I feel really bad for the maggot industry or whoever was like cultivating all

741
00:41:04.601 --> 00:41:07.970
the bugs and maggots for that show.
I really don't think that's much of a,

742
00:41:07.971 --> 00:41:12.920
but industries collapse.
It was a guy just like breathing,
meeting,

743
00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:16.540
<v 3>waiting for our order,
really weren't going to get much out of us.
Yeah.</v>

744
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:20.660
He bought a new car,
like house and he just show

745
00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:24.560
the magazine industry

746
00:41:27.350 --> 00:41:31.100
downtown La is also a where they shot Robert F.
Kennedy and I think they are,

747
00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.810
<v 4>no,
they shot him at the ambassador,</v>

748
00:41:32.811 --> 00:41:36.390
which is on Wilshire because that's not downtown.
Well,
it's kind,

749
00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:39.020
it's Korea town because it was,
I,
uh,

750
00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:42.350
I lived in the Gaylord across the street,
uh,
years ago.

751
00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:45.080
I remember I hung out what she wants.
Oh,
that's right.
You can buy a house.

752
00:41:45.081 --> 00:41:49.210
That's right.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
We hung out in some really interesting,
uh,

753
00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:53.330
circumstances throughout the years.
Yeah.
Well remember when,
um,

754
00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:57.230
I had to miss a road show you are on news radio and it was like,
I,
you know,

755
00:41:57.231 --> 00:42:01.100
it was like such a,
uh,
a juggernaut of,
uh,
and,

756
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:03.680
and had all this pressure on me.
I remember,
um,

757
00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:08.870
they had the new show and now I'm seeing a comedy central show or what?
NBC.

758
00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:13.190
NBC.
Oh,
what?
Wait a minute.
Which would show you talking when I had a sitcom.
Oh,

759
00:42:13.191 --> 00:42:16.570
Mr. Rhodes.
Dude.
That's when you are wrong hair,
right?
Yeah.

760
00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:18.950
And have you had a comedy central show as well?

761
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:21.080
I did a lot of stuff for comedy central.

762
00:42:21.081 --> 00:42:25.990
I did a Viva Vietnam and they let me fill them all kinds of stuff.
What?

763
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.200
I think you had a comedy central show as well.
Oh No.
You know what?

764
00:42:30.201 --> 00:42:33.020
I'm confusing it with your Dutch show,
your Amsterdam show.

765
00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:37.460
That was the show where it was.
It was,
you were the host of it,

766
00:42:37.461 --> 00:42:40.760
but it was another name.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

767
00:42:40.761 --> 00:42:42.770
It was the Kevin Masters show,

768
00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:45.590
the Kevin Masters show or late night with Kevin Masters.

769
00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:50.090
But there was no Kevin Masters.
No,
the Dutch people that bought that show,
uh,

770
00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:53.450
the network,
they uh,
they had bought a concept,

771
00:42:53.451 --> 00:42:57.950
they were going to do an American style late night talk show a lot of David

772
00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:59.960
Letterman,
Johnny Carson.
Uh,

773
00:42:59.961 --> 00:43:03.380
and we're gonna they named the guy before they found the guy and we're going to

774
00:43:03.381 --> 00:43:08.030
call him Kevin Masters.
They thought that was like the flashiest American name,

775
00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:12.590
a show Biz sounding name.
Kevin Masters.
And you know,

776
00:43:12.591 --> 00:43:15.560
I begged him not to do it.
I said,
please,
I think,
you know,
I've uh,

777
00:43:15.561 --> 00:43:19.550
I think Tom Rhodes is pretty catchy.
I really liked my name.
I've spent my life,

778
00:43:19.551 --> 00:43:24.380
you know,
trying to establish my name and uh,
they go,
well,
you know,
um,

779
00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:29.240
no wait,
that's the way it is.
It's going to be,
and you know,
it,
uh,

780
00:43:29.241 --> 00:43:33.590
you know,
the first year,
every newspaper magazine interview that I did,

781
00:43:33.591 --> 00:43:37.700
they would say,
who's Kevin Masters?
Why is it Kevin Masters?
And I would say,

782
00:43:37.701 --> 00:43:39.680
I don't know,
they named the guy before they found the guy.

783
00:43:39.681 --> 00:43:44.270
And then when guests would say,
Kevin,
I would say,
please,

784
00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:48.560
my name is Tom.
And,
uh,
I never answered to it.

785
00:43:48.561 --> 00:43:53.450
And so it was confusing for all the media.
And so they,
so the,
so the second,

786
00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:58.440
uh,
the second season onward,
it was called Kevin Masters starring cameras.

787
00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:03.860
So what,
what the fuck were they doing?
Is it just they were high?

788
00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:07.550
The Amsterdam people?
No,
no,
no.
And that's the thing about Holland is they the,

789
00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:12.320
you know,
um,
uh,
people,
normal people that don't smoke a lot of weed.

790
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:14.100
It's just,
it's,
it's,
yeah,

791
00:44:14.101 --> 00:44:18.700
they say you're either a teenager or a tourist if you smoke weed and it's kind

792
00:44:18.701 --> 00:44:20.520
of frowned upon a,

793
00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:23.120
if you're in your thirties and forties and you're still smoking weed,

794
00:44:23.121 --> 00:44:25.820
you're considered very immature.
Wow.

795
00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:29.390
Well that makes sense that that's what happens when you allow people to do

796
00:44:29.391 --> 00:44:31.030
whatever the fuck they want.
Well,
I,

797
00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:34.200
me and my wife is from Holland and we've had this conversation a lot,
you know,

798
00:44:34.201 --> 00:44:34.281
and,

799
00:44:34.281 --> 00:44:39.281
and her perception is that in the United States it's like really cool to smoke

800
00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:44.910
pot.
But in Holland,
you know,
they,
they,
you know,
marijuana is,
it tolerated.

801
00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:46.710
Um,
uh,

802
00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:51.360
they educate the people that it's actually an uncool thing and that it will

803
00:44:51.361 --> 00:44:54.030
deplete your creativity and your Polaris,

804
00:44:54.031 --> 00:44:57.630
how the fuck did they push that deplete your creativity?
I mean,
that's,

805
00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:58.790
that's what is this,
what's,

806
00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:03.820
that's common cultural perception in the way they teach it to style.

807
00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:06.090
They're very Calvinist Christian society.

808
00:45:06.091 --> 00:45:10.880
They believe in partying after you've worked a 50 hour work week.
Right,
right,

809
00:45:10.881 --> 00:45:11.461
right.
You know,

810
00:45:11.461 --> 00:45:16.100
you can do whatever you want as long as it doesn't harm other people.
And,
uh,

811
00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:19.800
well that's nice.
You got a little clip of it there.
Yeah,
that's a,

812
00:45:19.801 --> 00:45:24.600
she was the host of,
um,
what was Shazia?
Um,

813
00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:28.170
God,
more ally shot really hot red headed woman.

814
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:32.280
She was the host of,
uh,
who wants to be a millionaire.

815
00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:36.900
And how many years did you do this for?
I did it for two years.

816
00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:42.120
Did three seasons,
uh,
on there for two and then the same network.

817
00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:46.320
Let me be a presenter on a travel program.
So,
um,

818
00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:51.600
and it's really an interesting story because,
um,
you know,

819
00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:56.370
first of all,
the thing about Holland is a that always amazed me is that the,

820
00:45:56.371 --> 00:45:58.740
you know,
the drugs and prostitution are,
you know,

821
00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:01.770
not legal but they're tolerated.
And uh,

822
00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:04.620
but in Amsterdam they're like really strict.

823
00:46:04.650 --> 00:46:09.120
You're not allowed to ride your bicycle on certain streets and the cops do not

824
00:46:09.121 --> 00:46:11.460
fuck around.
You could be selling cocaine.
They don't care.

825
00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:15.840
Do not ride your bicycle on the certain streets.
And then also like a,

826
00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:20.220
you can get tickets for putting your garbage out a night early.

827
00:46:20.221 --> 00:46:23.640
Those are though they've got a lot of really strict rules even though like drugs

828
00:46:23.641 --> 00:46:27.930
and prostitution or are tolerated.
So I moved there for this Dutch girl.

829
00:46:27.931 --> 00:46:32.490
I had started playing in Europe a lot,
London primarily.
And uh,

830
00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:36.810
the comedy store in London is one of the greatest comedy clubs in the world.

831
00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:41.250
And you know,
once you crack London,
there's all these other worldwide tours,

832
00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:45.780
there's gigs in Asia and Australia.
And all over Europe,
uh,

833
00:46:45.781 --> 00:46:49.080
once you get in with London.
So I had played in Holland.

834
00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:53.520
I fell in love with this girl,
a little blonde Dutch girl.
And,
uh,

835
00:46:53.521 --> 00:46:57.270
I ended up moving to Holland for this girl and we were together for two years

836
00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:01.740
and I was doing,
um,
uh,
it wasn't much of a comedy scene in,
in,

837
00:47:01.741 --> 00:47:02.700
in Holland at the time.

838
00:47:02.701 --> 00:47:06.450
I was flying back and forth to London on weekends playing all over Europe and

839
00:47:06.451 --> 00:47:10.890
everything.
So the relationship didn't work out.
And,
uh,

840
00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:15.540
she broke up with me and I was just about to move back to the United States and

841
00:47:15.541 --> 00:47:17.340
I'd completely fallen in love with Holland.

842
00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:21.540
I thought it was just such a wonderful magic country and I loved everything

843
00:47:21.541 --> 00:47:22.374
about it.

844
00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:27.420
And these people saw me in a comedy club and they were looking for an American

845
00:47:27.421 --> 00:47:31.780
to host the late night talk show.
And they gave me the job.
So I got to stay.

846
00:47:31.781 --> 00:47:35.020
I thought I was,
you know,
this girl,
we broke up and I thought,

847
00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:40.030
I'm going back to the states,
but then boom,
I get this television opportunity.

848
00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:43.090
And,
uh,
you know,
I always dreamed of,

849
00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:45.370
I always loved Carson and you know,

850
00:47:45.371 --> 00:47:48.820
being the guy in the $3,000 suit coming out from behind the curtain,

851
00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:52.090
standing on the x doing your little five minute monologue,
you know,

852
00:47:52.091 --> 00:47:56.250
and so I got to live this dream.
And the girl that broke up with me,
uh,

853
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:59.590
for one year after,
uh,
she broke up with me,

854
00:47:59.591 --> 00:48:02.980
she would still get together and fuck me all the time,
Holla,

855
00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:07.390
Holla my kind of girl.
So,
uh,
I,
I was,

856
00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:08.890
I was still in love with her.
Oh,

857
00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:13.210
Tom and I wanted to get back together with her once in a few fine.

858
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:19.210
Was it Arthur?
You're writing poems?
Did you write a poem?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

859
00:48:19.211 --> 00:48:22.120
But I mean,
she was an amazing human being.
And then I,
uh,

860
00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:26.170
we're having dinner at this Greek restaurant one night,
and I told her,
you know,

861
00:48:26.171 --> 00:48:29.770
I still love you and I want to get back together with you and,
and I,

862
00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:33.280
I know we can make this work,
baby.
And she goes,
oh my God,

863
00:48:33.281 --> 00:48:35.170
I thought you knew this was just physical.

864
00:48:35.171 --> 00:48:36.460
I don't want to get back together with you.

865
00:48:36.850 --> 00:48:40.510
So I got all upset like a 14 year old boy and I stormed out of this restaurant

866
00:48:40.930 --> 00:48:44.140
and I jumped on my bicycle and I'm just peddling my ass off.

867
00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:45.880
I'm all upset and um,

868
00:48:45.881 --> 00:48:50.530
I'm just crying and I'm pedaling and I turned up lights,

869
00:48:50.531 --> 00:48:53.470
a strat,
one of the streets,
you're not allowed to ride your bicycle on.

870
00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:58.090
And my front wheel went into the tram track and I went over the handlebars and I

871
00:48:58.091 --> 00:49:00.940
landed on my face on the street,
my forehead and my nose.

872
00:49:00.941 --> 00:49:04.170
My Chin were scraped to hell.
And uh,

873
00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:08.740
the next day I woke up and my face is mangled and I had to be on television

874
00:49:08.741 --> 00:49:11.230
later that afternoon,
not a studio piece.

875
00:49:11.231 --> 00:49:15.100
It was a man on the street filming thing.
And my face is mangled.

876
00:49:15.101 --> 00:49:17.800
I didn't know what to do.
So I went to the buyer court,

877
00:49:17.890 --> 00:49:19.720
it's the biggest department store in Amsterdam.

878
00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:23.590
And I went to the makeup area and there was one chair open and I sat down and it

879
00:49:23.591 --> 00:49:26.110
was this gay guy and I told them my whole life story.

880
00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:28.870
Like I'm a stand up comedian from the United States and then moved here for this

881
00:49:28.871 --> 00:49:31.420
girl and it didn't work out and she still fuck me all the time.

882
00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:33.640
I want to get back together with you.
And she said,

883
00:49:33.641 --> 00:49:38.170
I thought you knew that was just physical.
And I go,

884
00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:42.310
I go and I got,
I got,
I got to be on television in three hours,
please help me.

885
00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:45.160
And the guy goes,
don't worry.

886
00:49:45.490 --> 00:49:48.820
I am a professional makeup artist and when I'm done with you and nobody will

887
00:49:48.821 --> 00:49:53.590
know anything happened to you and I am also in love with a bastard and he went

888
00:49:53.591 --> 00:49:57.010
to work on me and this guy did such an amazing job.

889
00:49:57.011 --> 00:50:00.220
If you known what you were looking for,
maybe you could have spotted it,

890
00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:01.750
you know on the television.

891
00:50:01.751 --> 00:50:06.670
But I swear to God this man did such a wonderful job covering up these,

892
00:50:06.671 --> 00:50:07.030
these,

893
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:12.030
these cuts on my face that I think the man saved my job and I went back the next

894
00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:14.710
day with flowers to thank him and he wasn't there.

895
00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:17.590
We went back the next day with flowers and he wasn't there.

896
00:50:17.591 --> 00:50:19.270
I went back every day that week of flowers.

897
00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:23.160
I still go back periodically and I've never seen the man ever again.

898
00:50:23.161 --> 00:50:25.570
It was an angel.
He never,
I think he was an angel.

899
00:50:25.571 --> 00:50:28.010
I think it was an angel was a gain.
Joel

900
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:31.980
<v 2>or he died of aids that night.
No,
you didn't man.
He was,</v>

901
00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:40.580
he died of aids that night.
That's ruthless from makeup.

902
00:50:40.650 --> 00:50:42.480
It's saw sour.

903
00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:46.850
My cute little heartbroken story.
I saw a crazy,

904
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:49.520
crazy interview with someone from,
uh,

905
00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:52.850
Colorado where they were talking about the shooting.

906
00:50:53.090 --> 00:50:55.550
About how the guy's gun jammed.
Yeah.

907
00:50:55.551 --> 00:50:59.120
And they believe that it was God that stepped in and jammed his gun.

908
00:50:59.150 --> 00:51:02.900
It's always God,
he's,
God does everything.
Yeah.
I wish we had got there sooner.

909
00:51:02.901 --> 00:51:07.390
Right,
right.
With God.
You can be available.
Oh,
Joe.

910
00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:09.250
Like a lightning bolt.
You get settled in there.

911
00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:12.430
Why couldn't the guy got a flat tire on the way over.
He got,

912
00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:16.460
the only time God was there was when the gun jammed.
Like wow.
Suit.

913
00:51:17.230 --> 00:51:21.140
What a horrible fucking tragedy man.
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.
It's so,

914
00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:23.940
it's so terrifying.
My cousin lives a few blocks from here,

915
00:51:23.970 --> 00:51:28.050
but bull of doing something like we're doing in these people,
you know,
they,

916
00:51:28.051 --> 00:51:32.630
they do it for fame and it should be illegal in,
in our media,

917
00:51:32.631 --> 00:51:37.040
in the United States to say the person's name in the news when,

918
00:51:37.041 --> 00:51:40.610
when somebody does one of these horrific shootings on innocent citizens,

919
00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:44.480
they should only refer to that person as that human Turd,

920
00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:48.080
that human Turd,
the chop,
those people in Colorado,

921
00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:52.700
that human turd that shot those people in Fort Hood,
Arizona,
Virginia Tech.
Yeah,

922
00:51:52.701 --> 00:51:56.150
that would be a wise thing to them.
But no human turd number one,

923
00:51:56.450 --> 00:52:00.410
target number 17 it's like a union buster sort of a thing.
People.

924
00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:03.640
No one's going to agree to not find his name.
You know,

925
00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:07.420
we've got to say right here,
come to go fuck yourself.com right.

926
00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:11.930
And said he was the joker.
You know?
And if the guy really was that big of a fan,

927
00:52:11.931 --> 00:52:14.630
why didn't he watch the first showing and shoot everybody up at the second

928
00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:19.200
viewing?
Doesn't matter.
It's the whole thing.
You said broken human beings.

929
00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:22.130
We just have to figure out how to fuck a human being become so broken.

930
00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:25.820
What is it?
Is it,
is it a chemical imbalance?

931
00:52:25.821 --> 00:52:29.810
Is he on medication as he psychotic?
I grew up in San Diego.
It's perfect.

932
00:52:29.811 --> 00:52:33.110
There scares me though,
is that his mother knew that it was him.

933
00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:37.070
When he came to visit her,
she knew that it was her son.
Oh really?
She was,

934
00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:39.470
you know,
when she had heard about it,
she knew it was him.

935
00:52:40.090 --> 00:52:44.610
<v 6>There's a comedian that uh,
alright.
Caleb.
Melody.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.</v>

936
00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:49.500
He uh,
I think,
uh,
if I remember correctly,
he actually did a set that night at,
uh,

937
00:52:49.810 --> 00:52:53.650
at the comedy works and then went to go see that movie later that night.

938
00:52:53.651 --> 00:52:57.430
And I guess he got shot in the face and he got shot in the eye.
He lost his eye.

939
00:52:57.431 --> 00:53:01.060
Yeah.
And then he just had a baby,
uh,
like a week ago.

940
00:53:01.061 --> 00:53:03.250
His wife out of or girlfriend and abandon.
You can go to,

941
00:53:03.251 --> 00:53:06.880
I think it's scalability.com support,
donate money,

942
00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:11.410
caleb.com and you can,
yeah,
you can donate,
read the store support caleb.com.

943
00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:12.190
Yeah.

944
00:53:12.190 --> 00:53:16.440
<v 2>So,
but uh,
that sucks.
That's,
yeah,
that's close to home.
You know,</v>

945
00:53:16.450 --> 00:53:21.450
comedian getting shot that's said any human to me it's just what the fuck it's,

946
00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:26.130
you wonder when we're ever going to get past this shit.
When Trayvon Martin thing

947
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:27.690
<v 0>happened,
you know,
uh,</v>

948
00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:32.670
and so much hate and anger in the media on both sides,

949
00:53:32.970 --> 00:53:35.640
you know,
so many people claiming that the media was a,

950
00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:40.670
in their portrayal and so many black people claiming that you know,
that this,

951
00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:42.790
this guy's are criminal.
And this guy said,

952
00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:46.100
<v 4>the white people were saying,
oh,
did you see what his Twitter name was?</v>

953
00:53:46.130 --> 00:53:49.580
It was something and word.
Well,
and uh,
like,

954
00:53:49.581 --> 00:53:51.560
like that justified that he got shot.

955
00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:55.740
<v 0>Yeah.
Yes.
No doubt.
It was not handled correctly.</v>

956
00:53:56.040 --> 00:54:00.450
No doubt.
You know,
there's a reason why that guy wasn't allowed to be a cop.

957
00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:04.560
They didn't want them to be a cop.
You know,
it wasn't,
it's not,
I mean,

958
00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:07.530
I know a lot of cops got gotta do to my cousin's a cop.
Yeah,

959
00:54:07.531 --> 00:54:11.280
you can become a cop,
but you know,
this guy couldn't,
why couldn't they?
Well,

960
00:54:11.281 --> 00:54:12.960
it's probably because there was some something wrong.

961
00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:17.280
It's probably something wrong there.
Whether the cops are like,
man,
not nude dude.

962
00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:20.340
<v 4>Right.
I mean,
[inaudible] got a gun anyway.</v>

963
00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:21.990
<v 0>Well man,
you know what I mean?</v>

964
00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:26.880
I guess you would want a real train security guard with a gun if you wanted to

965
00:54:26.881 --> 00:54:30.300
have a former military or former cop who was a security guard,

966
00:54:30.301 --> 00:54:31.290
but somebody who's trained,

967
00:54:31.291 --> 00:54:34.410
someone who's like legit knows what the fuck they're doing and it's followed

968
00:54:34.411 --> 00:54:34.680
protocol.

969
00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:38.070
<v 4>Great.
Well,
you know,
I'll show I'm from Oviedo Florida,</v>

970
00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:41.610
which is the next town over Sanford.
Uh,
you know,

971
00:54:41.611 --> 00:54:45.270
it's on like Jess up this massive lake that's connected to the Saint John's

972
00:54:45.271 --> 00:54:49.640
river that goes to the Atlantic.
It was supposed to be a,

973
00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:54.450
it was a big port in the civil war and there's,
you know,
there's some ancient,
uh,

974
00:54:54.451 --> 00:54:57.660
civil war era,
uh,

975
00:54:58.110 --> 00:55:02.960
mentality still in that area.
You really,
really,
I mean,
I mean,

976
00:55:02.970 --> 00:55:06.840
you got,
you got like very poor black neighborhoods.
Um,

977
00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:09.750
and in places in Florida and the south,

978
00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:13.410
you know where they are on one side of town.
Yeah.

979
00:55:13.590 --> 00:55:16.050
There's railroad tracks to the center of the town.

980
00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:19.320
Exactly like it would have on one side.
White people live on the other.

981
00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:23.640
That's what I'm talking about.
Like old,
you know,
uh,
American,

982
00:55:23.641 --> 00:55:26.580
south separatism and,
and uh,

983
00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:30.130
<v 0>lack of upward mobility.
Yeah,</v>

984
00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:33.400
it's exactly what we were talking about earlier then if you wanted to fix

985
00:55:33.401 --> 00:55:35.920
something,
man,
that would be the one thing that you would want to fix.

986
00:55:35.921 --> 00:55:38.560
And I think rich people would want to put a lot of money into that too.

987
00:55:38.561 --> 00:55:41.110
Like don't you want things to be safer and nicer?

988
00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:43.760
Wouldn't you want it if more people were,

989
00:55:43.761 --> 00:55:48.190
were friendly and kind and not like in desperate need,
you know,
don't,

990
00:55:48.191 --> 00:55:51.100
don't you think it'd be better if more people were in desperate need for

991
00:55:51.101 --> 00:55:53.720
whatever reason.
We have a hard time engineering that we have a hard,

992
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:57.570
a hard time looking at that as a number one priority.
Instead it's,
you know,

993
00:55:58.120 --> 00:55:58.470
you know,

994
00:55:58.470 --> 00:56:02.420
where the fuck are we gonna pull oil from knacks and w how much does corn get

995
00:56:02.421 --> 00:56:04.550
subsidized this year?
And you know,
what does,
what does,
what does,

996
00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:07.900
what are our gas prices?
And you know,
that's,

997
00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:12.130
we don't worry about fucking poor neighborhoods porn that poor neighborhoods are

998
00:56:12.131 --> 00:56:12.964
crazy.

999
00:56:13.030 --> 00:56:17.650
The idea that you could live and know that in this one area is like infested

1000
00:56:17.651 --> 00:56:22.651
with criminals and people who are uneducated and people who are struggling and

1001
00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:27.130
all the crime rates are far higher and nobody,
nobody,

1002
00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:30.910
nobody concentrates on that.
Nobody fixes that.
To me using,
it's really,

1003
00:56:30.970 --> 00:56:34.990
it's quite amazing.
It just shows you how sort of self centered,

1004
00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:37.390
the whole idea of running a government really is.

1005
00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:43.260
<v 4>I'll tell you how fucked up.
Um,
I mean,
I'll tell you how lame our government is.</v>

1006
00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:47.260
Um,
I was driving with my wife,
uh,

1007
00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:50.850
last year and am I where I was just talking,
uh,
you know,

1008
00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:54.420
about Guantanamo Bay and these people getting tortured and everything and I was

1009
00:56:54.421 --> 00:56:55.254
like,
mmm,

1010
00:56:55.620 --> 00:57:00.620
I wonder what the top 10 songs were that we tortured people with at Guantanamo

1011
00:57:00.990 --> 00:57:01.200
Bay.

1012
00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:04.940
And so she gets on the iPhone and she looked it up and you're not going to be

1013
00:57:05.250 --> 00:57:07.860
the number one song that we torture people with and go on Tottenham,

1014
00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:11.670
obey a it by Ben called a seed or diet aside.

1015
00:57:11.671 --> 00:57:16.380
It's called fuck your God.
It's like a very loud,
uh,
death metal song.
Okay.

1016
00:57:16.381 --> 00:57:19.650
So that,
that,
that,
that sounds appropriate for torturing people.

1017
00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:23.910
But like a number two was like,
uh,
no,
it was like,

1018
00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:29.070
it was like a,
I was like American Pie by Don Mclean.

1019
00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:31.990
Oh Wow.
Which is not a bad number.
And then,
uh,

1020
00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:36.780
I think number three was,
uh,
we will rock you.

1021
00:57:36.810 --> 00:57:39.830
We are the champions by queen the torture music.

1022
00:57:39.831 --> 00:57:43.350
I listen to that Brian May guitar riff forever.

1023
00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:45.330
I think what they're probably doing,

1024
00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:48.580
it's just repetitively breaking them down with noise.
Well,

1025
00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:50.340
we can't even get our torture songs.
Right.

1026
00:57:50.730 --> 00:57:52.650
Wouldn't it be great to know to make that playlist,

1027
00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:57.540
that platelet [inaudible] I would not have that if I was going to make that

1028
00:57:57.560 --> 00:58:02.290
playlist.
It would be like Helen Reddy,
I am woman a hundred times in a row.

1029
00:58:02.310 --> 00:58:06.020
I would talk.
I talk just,
Oh,
some of it.

1030
00:58:06.030 --> 00:58:10.350
Lots of Womans in Pakistan.
Me,
it's a big compound.
There's very tall,

1031
00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:14.550
just ended.
I am strong.
Hi.

1032
00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:17.293
Whoa.

1033
00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:22.680
It's over and over and over again to fucking jail.

1034
00:58:23.770 --> 00:58:27.240
He was fucking scream at the top of your lungs.

1035
00:58:27.250 --> 00:58:31.130
Just leap off the top of the building.
Did you hear snoop dog is no longer snoop.

1036
00:58:31.131 --> 00:58:34.370
Snoop,
lion.
Lion.
Yeah.
You went to Jamaica above.

1037
00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:36.470
The black guys can change your names.
It's bad ass.

1038
00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:39.480
And they usually have parties to do so like puff daddy.

1039
00:58:39.481 --> 00:58:42.510
Remember when he was parked?
Now he's not puff daddy anymore.
Now he's peed.

1040
00:58:42.511 --> 00:58:46.110
Diddy prince,
I'm just going to be a symbol.
I'm not even going to be a word.

1041
00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:47.070
That was really the best.

1042
00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:51.510
Prince was the smoothest move ever because I think that was a contractual thing

1043
00:58:51.511 --> 00:58:54.900
that he said that he could then he could make his own music or something because

1044
00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:58.290
he couldn't be prince and I don't think he could change his name.

1045
00:58:58.530 --> 00:59:01.720
It was like one of those deals because like,
okay,
um,
whew.
Yeah.

1046
00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:06.570
Cause you remember he put,
he had slave on his cheek for like a year,
you know.

1047
00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:08.760
Well the music companies are there.

1048
00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:13.730
Bad motherfuckers [inaudible] Robin rap guy that had the bandaid on this.

1049
00:59:13.731 --> 00:59:17.930
Jake?
No,
no,
no,
no.
Our Kelly is getting,

1050
00:59:18.910 --> 00:59:22.880
oh Nelly Nelly.
Yeah.
Bad days.
Right.
I wonder if bandaids we keep cool.

1051
00:59:22.910 --> 00:59:24.080
I wonder if that's healed.

1052
00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:28.370
And it was always on like different parts of his cheek.
Like you,

1053
00:59:28.371 --> 00:59:32.810
I switched this guys.
I thought I was in bad shape.
He was so good.
What,

1054
00:59:32.811 --> 00:59:35.630
how can we didn't put all your music?
I don't know.

1055
00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:39.210
Did he just get to rich and just go crazy?
Spent all his money on.
Well,

1056
00:59:39.211 --> 00:59:43.220
and that's always hit with,
with,
with,
with uh,
with rap guys is a,
you know,

1057
00:59:43.221 --> 00:59:47.780
when they make too much money then,
then they,
they kinda,
you know,
dude,

1058
00:59:47.781 --> 00:59:50.660
who's going to clean my pool is late.
You know,
it's,

1059
00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:53.960
it's not as street and loses the message a little bit.

1060
00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:56.290
<v 3>Well now that little Wayne's out of the Pokey,</v>

1061
00:59:56.920 --> 00:59:59.740
all that Shit's change my nasal.

1062
01:00:00.910 --> 01:00:04.860
<v 4>Well the whole way you well,
do you follow rap music at all?
Uh,</v>

1063
01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:08.310
I like everything music wise,
but yeah,
no,
I um,

1064
01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:11.800
<v 3>I like rap.
Um,
I I interrupted you,
you back.</v>

1065
01:00:11.801 --> 01:00:14.950
We were talking about when we first met or when we've met and hung out,

1066
01:00:14.951 --> 01:00:17.020
but one of them was when you have that NBC show,

1067
01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:20.120
<v 4>right.
That's what I was saying is that,
you know,
and so it was this,</v>

1068
01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:24.890
it was like this,
uh,
there was a lot of pressure.
It was very big time.

1069
01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:29.270
Uh,
and NBC had this unveiling of their new shows or,

1070
01:00:29.271 --> 01:00:32.360
or all their shows at the Lincoln Center in New York City.

1071
01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:37.010
And people are coming across the stage and then like I saw you backstage,

1072
01:00:37.011 --> 01:00:41.900
you came up to me and I was just like,
so happy to see a comedian.

1073
01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:45.110
Yeah.
You know,
and I,
I think,
you know,

1074
01:00:45.111 --> 01:00:48.500
we hung out and talked for most of the night cause like everybody else,

1075
01:00:48.501 --> 01:00:49.680
like actors and stuff,

1076
01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:53.250
<v 3>dude,
I felt the exact same way when,
whenever wanting to a real comedian,</v>

1077
01:00:53.251 --> 01:00:53.650
it's like,

1078
01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:57.090
<v 4>oh,
you're here.
I wanted to hug you.
I wanted to hug you.</v>

1079
01:00:57.110 --> 01:01:01.750
Please tell me what's life like in the same sane world you operate in.

1080
01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:03.360
When we were not saying,
but we're saying yes

1081
01:01:03.370 --> 01:01:06.940
<v 3>for us,
you know,
like a,
if you run in Doug Stan hope at the airport,</v>

1082
01:01:06.941 --> 01:01:11.180
you're so happy.
You know what I mean?
It's like,
yes.
Yeah.
You motherfucker.
Yeah.

1083
01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:16.690
Yeah.
I mean,
that's uh,
the glory of being friends with Comedians,
you know,

1084
01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:21.250
to have friends like Joey Diaz,
you know,
Joey Coco Diaz and you know,

1085
01:01:21.730 --> 01:01:23.400
so many of our friends are calm.
I mean,

1086
01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:25.270
everybody that we bring around here to the Ice House,

1087
01:01:25.271 --> 01:01:28.810
we have these ice house chronical shows.
He got to do one man,
they're so fun.

1088
01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:30.970
They're so fun.
You're here at the ice house this weekend,
right?

1089
01:01:30.971 --> 01:01:32.430
It's Friday and Saturday nights.
Friday and Saturday.

1090
01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:34.550
They've never seen Tom Rhodes.
He's a bad motherfucker.

1091
01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:39.630
International comedian or real comics comic dude has been around forever.
And,

1092
01:01:39.631 --> 01:01:43.810
uh,
the ice house is probably,
if not the oldest club in the country.

1093
01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:44.980
It's right up there.

1094
01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:49.850
<v 4>Yeah.
I'm all these classic comedy albums were recorded here.</v>

1095
01:01:49.851 --> 01:01:54.680
Like Bob Newhart the button down mind.
And,
uh,
the smothers brothers.

1096
01:01:54.910 --> 01:01:57.550
Um,
I just came out with a new CD and it's a,

1097
01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:00.860
it's a double CD thing.

1098
01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:03.080
One is live at the comedy store in Sydney,

1099
01:02:03.081 --> 01:02:05.480
Australia and the other one is live at the ice house.

1100
01:02:05.830 --> 01:02:09.060
<v 3>Did those comedy stores are like a rip off of the real comedy store?
Right.</v>

1101
01:02:09.061 --> 01:02:10.730
They don't pay the real comedy store.
They just

1102
01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:13.990
<v 4>called it the,
there's no,
there are,
none of them are related to the London one.</v>

1103
01:02:13.991 --> 01:02:18.991
The Sydney one sneaky international name thieving and motherfuckers taken money

1104
01:02:19.441 --> 01:02:23.500
out of Mitzi shore.
His pocket,
I think.
Uh,
she,
no,

1105
01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:27.010
that ain't the comedy store.
I think it's one in Japan too.
Right?
Right.

1106
01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:31.230
To a bitch.
Oh No.
Come to store.
I think they didn't,
uh,
you know,
uh,

1107
01:02:31.290 --> 01:02:34.470
copyright the name they fucked up there.
They only copywritten it.

1108
01:02:34.471 --> 01:02:36.990
Wrote it in California or the state,
whatever it is.

1109
01:02:36.991 --> 01:02:39.870
There's only two real comedy stores in the world,
Ladies and gentlemen.

1110
01:02:39.871 --> 01:02:43.650
It's Hollywood and La Jolla.
That's it.
Okay.
Let's not get crazy,
Tom.

1111
01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:47.970
I've never been a big comedy comedies for a guy.
Uh,
I just recently,

1112
01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:52.620
like this year,
I've done like three sets there.
And,
uh,
that's,

1113
01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:57.420
uh,
well I,
I've enjoyed going there and hanging out.

1114
01:02:57.421 --> 01:03:00.800
Like I think the last time I saw you was there a,

1115
01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:05.400
when I ran into a few years ago and you know,
a good friends of mine play there.

1116
01:03:05.550 --> 01:03:08.610
Um,
but I always had a strange feeling about the place,

1117
01:03:08.611 --> 01:03:12.150
which I'm starting to get over now,
uh,
because I've,

1118
01:03:12.151 --> 01:03:16.520
I've enjoyed playing there this year.
But,
uh,
I'm from,
uh,

1119
01:03:16.590 --> 01:03:20.310
the Orlando Florida area and when I was 19 years old,

1120
01:03:20.370 --> 01:03:25.150
I won this contest,
the funniest person in central Florida contest.

1121
01:03:25.550 --> 01:03:28.620
Uh,
not funny person in Florida,
funny person in central Florida,

1122
01:03:28.830 --> 01:03:30.550
which I think is hilarious.
Um,

1123
01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:33.930
there was a kid in south Florida who was a real bad ass.
Um,

1124
01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:39.180
and the Grand Prize of this contest was I got to go to fly to Los Angeles and do

1125
01:03:39.181 --> 01:03:42.210
a set at the comedy store.
And I'm 19 years old,
man.

1126
01:03:42.211 --> 01:03:45.630
I've been a comedy for two years.
La the Commons or,
oh my God,

1127
01:03:45.631 --> 01:03:48.360
you'd have thought I was doing Johnny Carson.
This is my break,
baby.

1128
01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:49.950
Cool in La man.

1129
01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:55.020
And in retrospect it was an open mic night and I only did five minutes,

1130
01:03:55.021 --> 01:03:58.900
but there was a,
a very famous comedian there.
Uh,

1131
01:03:58.910 --> 01:04:00.930
I won't mention the man's name.
Uh,

1132
01:04:00.931 --> 01:04:03.660
and he acted like I was the funniest comedian you've ever seen in his life.

1133
01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:09.180
And then he invites,
he a big guy.
I'm not saying Pauly shore.
No,

1134
01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:14.770
no,
let's just for the record state who was not Pauly shore?
Uh,
no,

1135
01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:18.830
let's go.
Let's,
let's,
uh,
leave some mystery.
Um,

1136
01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:23.730
anyway,
um,
so Amy not be a big guy.

1137
01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:26.880
He invites me to hang out with him and then he asked me to,
uh,

1138
01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:28.830
take a drive with him and Oh my God.
You know,

1139
01:04:28.831 --> 01:04:33.510
who wouldn't want to take a drive with famous guy and we'd car car.

1140
01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:36.420
We parked in front of,
uh,

1141
01:04:36.421 --> 01:04:41.421
the rage on Santa Monica for like 20 minutes and he said he's a bar.

1142
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:43.560
Well,
years later when I lived in La,

1143
01:04:43.561 --> 01:04:46.140
I find out the rage is like the biggest gay bar in Los Angeles.

1144
01:04:46.141 --> 01:04:50.400
I had no idea at the time.
So this guy is showing off his young meat.

1145
01:04:50.850 --> 01:04:55.650
And,
uh,
and then he says he needs to go by his apartment in Beverly Hills.

1146
01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:59.220
And,
uh,
we go in and they on his wall,

1147
01:04:59.221 --> 01:05:02.530
he had all these photos of him and famous people that were signed in.

1148
01:05:02.650 --> 01:05:07.050
And so we go from one side down all the way,
and he's showing me,

1149
01:05:07.170 --> 01:05:12.000
you know,
uh,
this is me with Gandhi and Martin Luther King and whatever,

1150
01:05:12.001 --> 01:05:13.750
whoever,
or,
whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.

1151
01:05:13.970 --> 01:05:17.280
And then we get to the end of the wall and it's the corner.

1152
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:21.430
<v 2>This was the guys move to show you the pictures.</v>

1153
01:05:21.431 --> 01:05:24.070
You start at one side and then boom,
you're in the corner.

1154
01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:26.170
And He makes this move on me.

1155
01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:30.310
And I'm 19 years old.
And,

1156
01:05:30.570 --> 01:05:34.880
and the guy steps in on me and like,
and,

1157
01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:39.990
and,
and I just like,
I just like Kinda,
I recoiled and,

1158
01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:45.190
and the guy steps in on me,
any,
he cupped my ass.
Oh,

1159
01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:47.090
with each hand.
He's got it.

1160
01:05:47.330 --> 01:05:50.240
And it asks you why you're afraid to say this man's name.
I don't say it.
Don't,

1161
01:05:50.241 --> 01:05:52.260
don't,
I won't say I won't.
I promise you,
I won't say it,

1162
01:05:52.510 --> 01:05:55.960
but I will say what it rhymes with.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Don't,
don't,
don't,
don't,

1163
01:05:55.961 --> 01:06:00.340
don't do it.
Please don't.
So anyway,
uh,
you know,
I said,

1164
01:06:00.341 --> 01:06:04.180
can we go back to the comedy store and,
um,

1165
01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:08.260
I can't help but reflect on that moment all these years later and think how much

1166
01:06:08.261 --> 01:06:10.480
further my career would have gone if I would've just fuck to that guy.

1167
01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:14.110
I don't think so.
You would lose all your street cred,
kidding,

1168
01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:17.890
loose somebody.
Anyway,
but that was why.
So like,
you know,

1169
01:06:17.891 --> 01:06:20.110
and I go back to Florida and I'm 19,
and I'm like,
people are like,
hey,

1170
01:06:20.111 --> 01:06:24.190
how was your trip to Hollywood?
I don't want to talk.
And uh,

1171
01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:28.520
have you talked to him since or sever?
Never seen the guy ever again.
But,
um,
uh,

1172
01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:32.920
but yeah,
so that kind of made me Chai away from the comedy store for,
well,

1173
01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:35.860
that makes sense.
I didn't know that that guy was doing that,

1174
01:06:35.861 --> 01:06:39.960
but it kind of makes sense.
I think a lot of those guys,
you know,

1175
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.060
I mean when you hear enough stories about dudes like that,

1176
01:06:43.061 --> 01:06:47.050
that the pull moves on misuses and stuff and oh my God,

1177
01:06:47.051 --> 01:06:50.020
how about John Travolta?
Man,
you think that's true?

1178
01:06:50.310 --> 01:06:53.890
Well you think he really had his ass cause like three or four guys came out and

1179
01:06:53.891 --> 01:06:58.360
said that he'd stick his ass up in the air and go,
he touch it.

1180
01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:03.710
Oh,
oh I just touched my,
my butthole.
I can only speculate.

1181
01:07:03.730 --> 01:07:08.170
Do you think maybe you think maybe he's just at a higher level of Scientology

1182
01:07:08.171 --> 01:07:10.690
than we would ever understand?
It could be the queen.
Maybe.

1183
01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:12.370
Maybe that's the top level.

1184
01:07:12.850 --> 01:07:16.000
You get to stick your ass up at people and beg them to touch it.
We're,

1185
01:07:16.001 --> 01:07:19.420
we're seeing as immoral activity is really the next phase of evolution.

1186
01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:23.020
And once you really appreciate the,
the pleasure of the prostate gland,

1187
01:07:23.050 --> 01:07:26.020
you can move x level of clear.

1188
01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:30.790
You can go super leisure of the process.
Super duper clear.
Well,

1189
01:07:30.791 --> 01:07:33.610
it's there to secret,
you know that the feelings are secret.

1190
01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:37.090
It's the best feeling of all time.
Have someone massage the prostate.

1191
01:07:37.091 --> 01:07:41.040
And John Travolta's obviously figured it out,
but these non,
he on the highest,

1192
01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:44.800
no is the highest level.
These people who are all delusional,

1193
01:07:44.801 --> 01:07:46.030
he should be able to pay,

1194
01:07:46.031 --> 01:07:50.440
especially as an upper level superman character in the fucking game of

1195
01:07:50.441 --> 01:07:53.410
Scientology.
He should be able to pay to get his asshole rob.
Right?

1196
01:07:53.411 --> 01:07:56.350
Why is leisure?
Why is he going to strangers?
Because we got a lot of talent.

1197
01:07:56.351 --> 01:07:56.581
Tails.

1198
01:07:56.581 --> 01:08:00.470
Two chasse pitches out there working in massage powers needing to learn to keep

1199
01:08:00.471 --> 01:08:05.440
they trap shed,
right?
I mean,
Hey,
what,
what happened to Mizzou?
Client

1200
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.740
potentiality.
Listen,
every comedian knows due to steal jokes.

1201
01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:14.830
Every Massoud should know a celebrity that wants you to finger in her asshole.

1202
01:08:15.550 --> 01:08:16.040
It's part

1203
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:19.730
<v 6>of your job,
man.
You should know what's dangerous.
You know what I'm saying?</v>

1204
01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:22.840
If you want to be a UFC fighter,
don't play footsies with hootsuite Maher.

1205
01:08:22.850 --> 01:08:25.270
Paul Harris,
you know what I'm saying?
I uh,

1206
01:08:25.370 --> 01:08:28.190
watched an info commercial last night called them Milan abroad.

1207
01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:31.460
Have you heard of this thing?
Milan abroad?
I think the drr yeah,

1208
01:08:31.461 --> 01:08:34.940
I think there's all the old UFC,
a ring girl was in it,

1209
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:37.250
but it's weird because it was,

1210
01:08:37.310 --> 01:08:40.430
it was such a man bashing commercial.

1211
01:08:40.610 --> 01:08:43.550
First it starts off like saying like is your abroad doing this and that and

1212
01:08:43.551 --> 01:08:46.970
they're showing all these really luscious hot girls and then they showed this

1213
01:08:46.971 --> 01:08:49.340
bra and it's just like the most ugliest,
grossest thing.

1214
01:08:49.341 --> 01:08:53.220
And it's like hide that cleavage abroad was designed by men,
you know,
and like,

1215
01:08:53.330 --> 01:08:56.630
and then they did like that fake game show thing where they have like a studio

1216
01:08:56.631 --> 01:09:01.160
audience.
Like now did a man make this?
No,
this is the way women should look.

1217
01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:03.380
Anyways,
I just found it on youtube.

1218
01:09:03.530 --> 01:09:07.250
Just to show you a little example of how insane this is.
A,

1219
01:09:07.251 --> 01:09:10.100
if it's called the Milana brawl by Jeannie,
spell it.

1220
01:09:10.101 --> 01:09:14.530
Mulana having another bad broad day,
shoulders drafts and hot shower,

1221
01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:15.940
digging in hooks,

1222
01:09:16.010 --> 01:09:20.630
poking you in the back and bras that just don't look at this talk was really

1223
01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:21.783
commercials.

1224
01:09:23.290 --> 01:09:28.240
<v 7>Introducing the Milan abroad by Jeannie,
designed by a woman for women.</v>

1225
01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:31.030
This amazing bra gives you super support,

1226
01:09:31.210 --> 01:09:35.500
amazing lift and incredible comfort.
All in a beautiful hands.

1227
01:09:35.570 --> 01:09:37.150
Don't lace Cammie style.

1228
01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:41.920
Say Goodbye to painful straps that are digging into your shoulders.

1229
01:09:42.350 --> 01:09:45.880
<v 6>See if you see the full commercial art,
it's on late night TV.</v>

1230
01:09:46.030 --> 01:09:50.710
It will make you so pissed off at like at like what they say.

1231
01:09:50.730 --> 01:09:53.500
And you could just tell.
It's like,
like,
why would,

1232
01:09:53.501 --> 01:09:55.930
why do you want to show your cleavage?
You know,
don't,

1233
01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:58.970
don't give into the man and stuff like that.
Get them a know.

1234
01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:01.960
What I think they're saying is that that other shit is uncomfortable,

1235
01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:02.890
uncomfortable.

1236
01:10:02.890 --> 01:10:06.700
Underarm bulge disappears and you've somehow or another turn that into a man

1237
01:10:06.701 --> 01:10:11.180
versus woman thing.
Embarrassing cleavage and God

1238
01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:16.270
sexy classically which bits?
You don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

1239
01:10:16.570 --> 01:10:20.410
It's always there.
That sounds very,
very smooth.
So I'm happy about that.

1240
01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:22.660
It's the one broad,
oh,
shut these ladies.

1241
01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:25.660
I don't want to hear about that will drive you crazy.
But anyways,

1242
01:10:25.661 --> 01:10:29.530
I think the first part is awesome.
I think it's just the old UFC girl rate.

1243
01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:34.240
Let me see if I can find it.
Uh,
nevermind.
I'll find it.
Don't hurt right there.

1244
01:10:34.241 --> 01:10:38.680
Yeah,
probably.
Yeah,
it does.
A lot of those.
She's,
yeah,

1245
01:10:38.681 --> 01:10:43.570
that's Shondelle.
Yeah,
she does a lot of modeling.
Unfortunately.
She did some,

1246
01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:47.200
some new type stuff at one point in time.

1247
01:10:47.470 --> 01:10:50.230
Isn't that what we all expect from your ring girl?
Yeah.

1248
01:10:50.231 --> 01:10:54.030
You're allowed to do certain levels of nude type stuff.
I don't know,
just to me,

1249
01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:58.100
but no whole closeup.
No animals.
Ridiculous.
Yeah.

1250
01:10:58.330 --> 01:11:02.470
I just think it's so crazy.
People are so Weirdo when it comes to that shit.

1251
01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:05.620
Especially now with technology and teenagers with so I'm so glad.

1252
01:11:05.621 --> 01:11:08.410
Like cell phones went around like camera phones when I was a teenager.

1253
01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:13.120
It'd be hours online.
We do an hour long films.
We like really got lucky.

1254
01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:14.093
We missed that.

1255
01:11:14.150 --> 01:11:17.190
<v 2>I know,
but I mean like there's so many girls,
uh,
you know,</v>

1256
01:11:17.191 --> 01:11:20.020
taking pictures of their snatches.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Well there,

1257
01:11:20.021 --> 01:11:22.740
there's horrible hacks have happened in like,

1258
01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:25.380
I think that'll be the new fingerprinting system in the future.

1259
01:11:26.730 --> 01:11:29.820
You know how people have those accounts where you can upload pictures from your

1260
01:11:29.821 --> 01:11:33.810
cell phone when people have hacked into those and got a lot of girls like secret

1261
01:11:33.811 --> 01:11:38.690
photos of Weikel loads on their faces.
America.
Well,
you know,
like that,

1262
01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:41.910
that,
that uh,
Rupert Murdoch's sons scandal in England.
I mean,

1263
01:11:41.911 --> 01:11:43.290
no wonder like if it,

1264
01:11:43.291 --> 01:11:46.710
what does that scandal where like they hacked into people's email accounts and

1265
01:11:46.711 --> 01:11:47.544
that they were also,

1266
01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:53.190
they were eavesdropping on celebrity's phone calls and they could retrieve,
um,

1267
01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:57.960
um,
uh,
their voice mails and things.
That's incredible.
So I mean,
like,
I,
you know,

1268
01:11:57.990 --> 01:12:02.100
Rupert Murdoch got in trouble for that.
That was the show,
the data.
They'd also,

1269
01:12:02.101 --> 01:12:06.150
there was a girl who had been abducted and killed and then he got her voice

1270
01:12:06.151 --> 01:12:10.830
messages but also like cute brands and all these people,
they were like,

1271
01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:12.900
you know,
listening to what happened to his phone calls.

1272
01:12:13.230 --> 01:12:17.070
They checked the message and it gave the family hope that she was still alive.

1273
01:12:17.071 --> 01:12:20.350
That was it.
They knew that the phone,
that someone had checked since then,
like,

1274
01:12:20.550 --> 01:12:23.070
oh,
she's alive.
She's alive.
Right,
right,
right,
right.
I mean,
miles,

1275
01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:26.100
she wasn't alive.
That's some creepy shit,
man.

1276
01:12:26.150 --> 01:12:30.510
They ghoulish you know,
and so how come he's not in jail?
Oh,

1277
01:12:30.511 --> 01:12:34.080
he's really funny.
He's really super rich.
Super,
super,
super rich.
Yeah.

1278
01:12:34.081 --> 01:12:37.590
If that was Tom Rhodes,
Tom Rhodes,
you'd be in jail right now and then amazing.

1279
01:12:37.591 --> 01:12:38.750
And we just sort of,
it like,

1280
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:43.570
well he is super rich and we still live in like a king era when it's still

1281
01:12:43.910 --> 01:12:47.970
really like that.
If you're lazy.
When he was in court,
some guy,
uh,

1282
01:12:47.971 --> 01:12:52.730
I was in Europe,
so I saw some guy who came in with the Pi and smashed the pine,

1283
01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:54.810
his face.
But his,
his,
uh,

1284
01:12:54.811 --> 01:12:58.650
his Asian wife jumped up and deck to the guy.
It was like,

1285
01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:02.580
do you think it's even possible to like take Bill Gates to court?

1286
01:13:02.790 --> 01:13:06.480
You know what I mean?
To like prosecute him with some sort of a crime.
Could you,

1287
01:13:06.510 --> 01:13:10.410
could you ever go after him?
He's,
he,
when you have that kind of money,
I mean,

1288
01:13:10.411 --> 01:13:13.470
isn't it possible like stop everything in its tracks?
Like,

1289
01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:17.850
could Rupert Murdoch go to jail?
They ever,
could.

1290
01:13:17.851 --> 01:13:19.590
You ever see him being arrested and never had,

1291
01:13:19.591 --> 01:13:21.570
especially since he doesn't live in America,
right?

1292
01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:26.600
It doesn't even live in Australia.
Uh,
yeah.
Yeah.
He's Australian,
but um,

1293
01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:27.960
but doesn't live in him.
He knows where he lives.

1294
01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:29.670
He lives wherever it lives on top of Mount Everest,

1295
01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:31.370
the probably lives everywhere.
Sons.

1296
01:13:31.371 --> 01:13:35.520
It's probably got a house and every state just drives into that shit son.

1297
01:13:36.150 --> 01:13:39.450
You got Rupert Murdoch,
top money.
That guy's not going to jail now.

1298
01:13:39.451 --> 01:13:43.260
He's probably got a,
you know,
a farm of,
um,

1299
01:13:43.650 --> 01:13:46.590
poor people that he's going to start you taking their organs as he gets older.

1300
01:13:46.650 --> 01:13:51.210
Yeah,
that's probably clones.
It's probably a headless versions of him.
You know,

1301
01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:54.760
they're going to chop his old head off and stick on some super young body.
Right.

1302
01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:59.040
It's going to be awesome.
You want to be like 70 from the neck up and 20,

1303
01:13:59.210 --> 01:14:03.600
20 young people get the card is a rock.

1304
01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:07.320
People guessed the comic.
No,
they didn't.
No,
they didn't Brian.
All right.
No,

1305
01:14:07.590 --> 01:14:12.250
they didn't.
Did they?
No.
No,
that's right.
They didn't

1306
01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:14.850
<v 3>say that it would,
they didn't.
Right.
They didn't do it on this.</v>

1307
01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:18.610
A lot of them got it wrong.
Right on my space.
Yeah.
They got it wrong everywhere.

1308
01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:22.720
Yeah.
Brian,
you don't want to get sued by that guy.
Totally.

1309
01:14:22.930 --> 01:14:27.190
Plus he'll corner you.
He's got moves.
He's got traps set up all around the city,

1310
01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:31.360
forever conversations with you.
Can we just walk over here and have a boom?

1311
01:14:31.361 --> 01:14:32.194
Next thing you know,

1312
01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:35.420
<v 4>um,
the,
uh,</v>

1313
01:14:35.490 --> 01:14:38.230
<v 3>the trap,
the trap was masterful.
It was really amazing.</v>

1314
01:14:38.250 --> 01:14:40.570
Who's is with the famous [inaudible],
the playmaker

1315
01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:43.930
<v 4>David Lee Roth,
that is a,
his mansion in Pasadena.</v>

1316
01:14:43.950 --> 01:14:48.340
And he had his gold records from the front door up the staircase to the bedroom.

1317
01:14:48.341 --> 01:14:51.740
So when he would bring women over,
I mean,
this might just be,
you know,
um,

1318
01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:54.640
he's an urban mythology,
but even come in and go,
oh,

1319
01:14:54.641 --> 01:14:57.600
let me show you my gold records and then boom,
we're in the bedroom.
So I mean,

1320
01:14:58.510 --> 01:15:01.180
masterful.
I mean,
that might be bullshit,
but change shit.

1321
01:15:01.181 --> 01:15:04.380
He's got Damn David Lee Roth believable.

1322
01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:07.800
Let's talk about excesses.
Gabe.

1323
01:15:07.810 --> 01:15:11.850
David Lee Roth man grabs a hero.
There was a,

1324
01:15:11.950 --> 01:15:15.730
there was a story.
Uh,
Paul Williams,
I guess.

1325
01:15:15.731 --> 01:15:18.880
And remember Paul Williams is a little guy and hoser yeah,
singer.

1326
01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:22.360
I think it was Paul Williams and like some friends of Johnny Carson's this

1327
01:15:22.361 --> 01:15:26.800
little men's drinking group in the 70s where they,

1328
01:15:27.190 --> 01:15:31.030
they in,
this might be urban mythology as well,
but,
uh,
it's a great story.

1329
01:15:31.030 --> 01:15:34.660
I heard years ago that they would try and top each other like,
uh,

1330
01:15:34.690 --> 01:15:39.220
doing a special lunch for each other and like,
just the most extravagant,

1331
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:43.410
you know,
rich guy,
shit they could think of and that,
uh,
they,

1332
01:15:43.411 --> 01:15:47.830
they stopped playing the game.
I forget who it was,
but like,

1333
01:15:47.831 --> 01:15:49.060
somebody that,
you know,

1334
01:15:49.061 --> 01:15:52.900
that it sends limos to get all six of the guys or whatever,
and they'd go to the,

1335
01:15:53.050 --> 01:15:56.020
you know,
Burbank airport or wherever and like,

1336
01:15:56.170 --> 01:16:00.830
there's like six helicopters waiting and they fly out and there's like a,

1337
01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:01.380
uh,

1338
01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:06.380
a prostitute in each helicopter who handed them a bag lunch with a sandwich and

1339
01:16:06.641 --> 01:16:11.641
then the helicopter hovered over each guy's house and their wives are probably,

1340
01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:15.070
and they got to eat the sandwich and get a blow job

1341
01:16:15.530 --> 01:16:19.010
<v 3>as the helicopter hovered over their house.
That's beautiful.</v>

1342
01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:21.500
And then like whoever was in charge that,
okay,

1343
01:16:21.501 --> 01:16:26.190
that'll never be topped some James Bond type awesomeness.
That's bad ass.

1344
01:16:26.210 --> 01:16:29.710
That's why it's worth it to become a fucking billionaire.
Yeah.

1345
01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:32.840
Rupert Murdoch probably has like buttons and he presses and chicks come out of

1346
01:16:32.841 --> 01:16:36.410
the fridge [inaudible] naked chicks and they just suck his cock.

1347
01:16:36.650 --> 01:16:40.310
He probably has it set up like little spring traps everywhere in the house and

1348
01:16:40.311 --> 01:16:43.190
he forgets about them once in a while and even though we've got our dead one and

1349
01:16:43.191 --> 01:16:47.510
if I want a blow job I will press this button.
She appears in the bathroom.

1350
01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:51.680
Yeah.
So right when he's about to honey,
I'll be right back.

1351
01:16:51.681 --> 01:16:55.920
It's going to take a shit.
She pops out of the floor and it's in a capsule wash.

1352
01:16:57.380 --> 01:16:59.220
Like those things.
They hadn't star Trek.
She does.

1353
01:17:00.410 --> 01:17:04.430
The floor rises like a half a second.
She's already underneath and they could,

1354
01:17:04.730 --> 01:17:08.730
he just shoves his cock in her mouth.
Boom.

1355
01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:10.070
I was thinking,

1356
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:12.740
<v 6>I was thinking last night there was so many hot Asian girls that we should have</v>

1357
01:17:12.741 --> 01:17:15.830
like a discount of your hot Asian.
Greg get $5 off your ticket or something.

1358
01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:17.700
<v 3>Shut up bro.
Fuck.</v>

1359
01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:21.570
If he wanted to do that route from where I wanted to do that,

1360
01:17:21.571 --> 01:17:24.960
he could have it set up where it's where he takes a shit because no woman ever

1361
01:17:24.961 --> 01:17:29.250
want to walk in on an old man was taking a shit and old men start shitting.

1362
01:17:29.490 --> 01:17:31.410
All you have to do is say,
all right,
I don't want to take a shit.

1363
01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:35.580
And he could just have,
no one would ever know if he had some offset tile.

1364
01:17:35.810 --> 01:17:39.210
If he had some really interesting tile and just had you know,
a good,
you know,

1365
01:17:39.211 --> 01:17:41.820
weird geometrical design that this,

1366
01:17:41.821 --> 01:17:45.450
this capsule was made out of and then you know,
he'd do that.
Have them waiting.

1367
01:17:45.570 --> 01:17:48.750
You'd have them waiting.
You know,
maybe you had like a little iPhone app,

1368
01:17:49.170 --> 01:17:54.170
maybe has a little iPhone 6:00 PM in the shitter and it just shows up.

1369
01:17:54.691 --> 01:17:58.660
Shuts that.
Checking your Twitter again.
Yeah,

1370
01:17:58.661 --> 01:18:02.030
I like it recognized and when he's in the room and maybe he has a chip and in

1371
01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:05.790
his arm so that every room it goes into the right lighting and mood light comes

1372
01:18:05.791 --> 01:18:10.110
on,
walks in that bathroom.
They know it's him hook her out of the floor.

1373
01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:15.690
I mean when that would be amazing if he could really pull it off and no one knew

1374
01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:16.500
and then you're like,

1375
01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:20.100
you get there like later on he dies and they find out he was like a Nazi or some

1376
01:18:20.101 --> 01:18:21.900
crazy shit.
So they have to go through his house.

1377
01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:26.100
I know his wife is like 40 years younger than him and when the media goes

1378
01:18:26.101 --> 01:18:28.460
through his house,
they find these capsules and they were they,

1379
01:18:28.461 --> 01:18:33.461
they led to this underground tunnels that led to an airplane runway when they

1380
01:18:34.291 --> 01:18:37.920
would bring girls to write from Thailand and they would just go into the

1381
01:18:37.921 --> 01:18:41.180
capsules.
They didn't even know where they were.
They were blindfolded,

1382
01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:46.020
the whole flight.
They were just brought in as Rupert Murdoch's bathroom suckers.

1383
01:18:47.730 --> 01:18:50.160
<v 6>Have you actually really ever had your Dick Suck?
Whoa.</v>

1384
01:18:50.290 --> 01:18:52.960
<v 3>On the toilet?
No,
that's pretty gross.
That's pretty good.</v>

1385
01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:56.050
That's so rude to make someone smell your shit and suck your Dick.

1386
01:18:56.051 --> 01:19:00.940
You greedy bitch.
Dana would one or the other?
Yeah,
maybe Dana would,
but yeah.

1387
01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:03.830
<v 6>How funny was that?
Last night we had a,
a podcast,</v>

1388
01:19:03.831 --> 01:19:08.300
the icehouse chronicles of a dandy or Oman and dom Arrera knew everything about

1389
01:19:08.301 --> 01:19:09.134
her.
It was,

1390
01:19:09.410 --> 01:19:13.780
<v 3>oh,
Tom's the best jobs at this.
Those a woman.
Yeah,</v>

1391
01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:17.990
Dom's the best.
She's a confirmed program from the get go.
Yeah.
He said like what?

1392
01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:20.140
Tell stories about which crazy chick he was living with.

1393
01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:23.440
It was that one crazy stripper.
You remember that one jail.
It was like,

1394
01:19:23.441 --> 01:19:27.070
as opposed to which one wasn't a crazy stripper

1395
01:19:29.150 --> 01:19:33.280
that where we're already,
he's,
he's like,
he's a real deal.
You know?

1396
01:19:33.430 --> 01:19:36.370
I love knowing that this is a guy like that out there.
Right?

1397
01:19:36.371 --> 01:19:40.550
He's a guy like Tom or were still write new material.
So yeah,

1398
01:19:41.170 --> 01:19:45.640
we had them at the ice house.
Joey Diaz.
Dot.
Merera.
That was Brody Stevenson.

1399
01:19:46.110 --> 01:19:49.420
Dom Irrera is a mother of Craig show.
Hillar crushed it.

1400
01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:53.530
I watched him crush it on a Friday night on a Wednesday night.
I mean,

1401
01:19:53.531 --> 01:19:55.420
he always nails it and it's like,

1402
01:19:55.421 --> 01:19:59.080
it's so inspiring to see that he's always writing.
You know?
I love that.

1403
01:19:59.081 --> 01:20:01.270
I love my seat.
He's always got a fucking notebook with him.

1404
01:20:01.271 --> 01:20:03.370
It's always going over some shit before he goes on.

1405
01:20:03.610 --> 01:20:06.880
Some dudes just somewhere along the line,
they just kind of like give up on that.

1406
01:20:07.070 --> 01:20:07.970
Right.
Not

1407
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:09.800
<v 2>Him.
Tom Dahmer's out there slinging.</v>

1408
01:20:09.820 --> 01:20:12.720
I love that when you see older guys still care and still put the work in.

1409
01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:16.110
I'm friends with uh,
it's a real common friends with rich hall and he's,

1410
01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:20.460
and he's in London and you see him and you're like,
God,
it's,
yeah,
he's fantastic.

1411
01:20:20.490 --> 01:20:22.860
He was one of the guys I paid to see before ever did comedy.

1412
01:20:23.130 --> 01:20:26.460
I saw him at a stitches Comedy Club in Boston,
Massachusetts,

1413
01:20:26.790 --> 01:20:30.810
like right before I did my first open mic night.
It was cool.

1414
01:20:30.811 --> 01:20:35.280
He was him and this Guy Teddy Burger performed Teddy Burger on.

1415
01:20:35.281 --> 01:20:38.700
Was this a local headliner who was a brilliant,

1416
01:20:38.701 --> 01:20:43.230
brilliant comedian who really never got his,
it never really,

1417
01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:46.620
it never got his notoriety because he had a problem with drugs and alcohol and

1418
01:20:46.621 --> 01:20:50.520
all kinds of shit.
He's like a legend back in Boston.
I mean,
just amazing,

1419
01:20:50.521 --> 01:20:54.100
amazing comedian.
And I saw a ritual.
Denise,
what was his,

1420
01:20:54.570 --> 01:20:59.010
I remember he played in Orlando when I was at like open miker and uh,

1421
01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:00.390
he had a lot of props.
He came out,

1422
01:21:00.391 --> 01:21:03.860
he had like a tricycle and there was a car door welded to it.
Yeah.

1423
01:21:03.861 --> 01:21:06.540
And he like he'd rolled down the window and he leaned out the,

1424
01:21:06.980 --> 01:21:09.090
it was like really cute stuff.
Yeah.

1425
01:21:09.091 --> 01:21:13.860
He had a lot of weird niblets but um,
but yeah,
no,
he's like,

1426
01:21:13.861 --> 01:21:14.860
what was this niglets though?

1427
01:21:14.861 --> 01:21:18.300
Explained those were words for things that there are no words,

1428
01:21:18.301 --> 01:21:21.860
like belly button lint and all these different sites around the milk carton

1429
01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:23.670
night falls off into your cereal.

1430
01:21:23.671 --> 01:21:28.170
Every time you on screen paste it sticks to the sink.
And,
um,

1431
01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:33.210
but he's actually,
you know,
very political,
social minded comedian now he's,

1432
01:21:33.220 --> 01:21:36.390
is it really?
Yeah.
And you see him and it's,
I mean he's,
you know,

1433
01:21:36.391 --> 01:21:39.030
like that was the thing about miles Davis.
He,
um,

1434
01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:43.440
he had like seven or eight different styles in the course of his career and

1435
01:21:43.441 --> 01:21:47.830
that's Kinda like rich hall is,
you know,
gotta be on his ninth style of comedy.

1436
01:21:47.940 --> 01:21:51.960
So he's doing it in London now.
Plays theaters all over England.
Yeah.
Didn't he?

1437
01:21:51.961 --> 01:21:56.880
How many farm and like British Columbia,
he's got a ranch in Montana.
Montana.

1438
01:21:56.881 --> 01:21:57.714
Yeah,
that's right.

1439
01:21:57.740 --> 01:22:00.810
I went out and stayed with him a couple of years ago for the month of August

1440
01:22:00.811 --> 01:22:05.190
ranch in Montana because I know Harris Pete from the comedy store was a buddy of

1441
01:22:05.191 --> 01:22:09.660
his and Harris piece to do stuff with them out in the ranch.
Yeah.
He's got,

1442
01:22:09.661 --> 01:22:13.860
he's got a really easy thing to have a ranch in Montana.
Right.
That's legit.

1443
01:22:13.950 --> 01:22:17.970
That is legit.
That's big sky said.
It's so beautiful out there.
And he's got,

1444
01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:22.800
he's got a,
uh,
a pitching machine set up in his,
in his endless backyard.

1445
01:22:23.570 --> 01:22:28.250
And so we would sit and he loves it in Montana's beautiful.
Uh,
and,

1446
01:22:28.251 --> 01:22:33.000
and so we would sit in his backyard for just hours smacking the shit out of

1447
01:22:33.001 --> 01:22:35.370
baseballs.
And that's all I was like,
you know,
when you're a kid and you think,

1448
01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:37.410
oh man,
if I ever get a lot of money,

1449
01:22:37.411 --> 01:22:41.250
I'm going to have a batting machine in my backyard,
you know?
But,
well,
I mean,

1450
01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:43.590
Montana is most certainly beautiful.
Don't get me wrong.

1451
01:22:43.591 --> 01:22:46.730
But why did he pick that as opposed to like Wyoming,
Colorado?
Like what,

1452
01:22:46.731 --> 01:22:51.570
what about Montana appealed to him?
I,
it's stunning.
There.
I the,
you know,

1453
01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:56.430
the area is Livingston and it's just,
it's,
it's breathtaking.

1454
01:22:56.730 --> 01:22:59.130
You know?
What else is amazing?
They're very,
there's a lot of cool,

1455
01:22:59.250 --> 01:23:03.510
I think a Jeff Bridges lives there.
Peter Fonda lives there.

1456
01:23:03.511 --> 01:23:06.060
There's a lot of,
you think you can hang out with them if you live there?
I

1457
01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:07.780
<v 4>think,
yeah.
I mean,
I,
uh,</v>

1458
01:23:08.050 --> 01:23:12.750
Walter Kearns is writer who wrote up in the air.
Um,
you know,

1459
01:23:12.751 --> 01:23:15.520
this is a small town.
Everybody knows each other,
you know,

1460
01:23:15.521 --> 01:23:19.870
so we're on is sitting on his,
uh,
on his porch,
people coming by and,
you know,

1461
01:23:20.230 --> 01:23:21.950
it's awesome.
Hmm.
Um,

1462
01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:26.320
I actually hit a deer and I had to stay a week longer than I had anticipated.

1463
01:23:26.710 --> 01:23:30.520
And I always thought that kind of makes you hit a deer.
Yeah.
My car was,
uh,

1464
01:23:30.521 --> 01:23:35.050
the whole front end was smashed and repaired.
Yeah,
I could,

1465
01:23:35.051 --> 01:23:38.710
it was undrivable wow.
But,
and it was like four o'clock in the afternoon.

1466
01:23:38.711 --> 01:23:40.210
Really Sunny,
beautiful day.

1467
01:23:40.211 --> 01:23:43.600
I always thought that kind of thing happened at night and I was only going like

1468
01:23:43.601 --> 01:23:46.660
45,
uh,
I was just building up momentum.

1469
01:23:46.661 --> 01:23:51.661
I had just turned on this road and it was actually kind of beautiful to see this

1470
01:23:52.841 --> 01:23:56.710
gorgeous creature up close like that as it bounced off my hood.

1471
01:23:57.420 --> 01:24:02.230
It's like this really radiant a red brown coat.

1472
01:24:02.810 --> 01:24:03.051
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1473
01:24:03.051 --> 01:24:08.051
We're so removed from the variety of nature that a deer is like some shit from

1474
01:24:08.301 --> 01:24:12.230
Avatar,
you know,
it's alive.
Look,
it's alive.

1475
01:24:12.410 --> 01:24:15.410
Like we control all the animals in our perimeter.

1476
01:24:15.411 --> 01:24:19.160
That's why we're able to like walk down streets or bear fleshy acids.

1477
01:24:19.161 --> 01:24:21.590
We don't have to worry about elks ramming us and shit.

1478
01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:23.270
We sort of control the perimeters.

1479
01:24:23.271 --> 01:24:26.090
We keep the animals out with all this hard surface and craziness.

1480
01:24:26.091 --> 01:24:28.460
But deers are supposed to be around people.

1481
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:30.290
It's like that's what you're supposed to be their food.

1482
01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:31.220
You're supposed to live around them.

1483
01:24:31.910 --> 01:24:34.360
<v 2>Yes.
Yes.
You got to have a good bumper though,
man.</v>

1484
01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:36.070
You ever see those bumpers that they make for trucks?

1485
01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:39.310
That's why everybody has trucks there and I,
you know,
not just trucks.

1486
01:24:39.311 --> 01:24:43.660
They have oh spit specific type of bumper.
Right.
Rock CV.
Pull it up Brian.

1487
01:24:43.661 --> 01:24:45.880
Cause it's like some road warrior type Shit.

1488
01:24:46.150 --> 01:24:49.030
They've a cleaver bumper cars knock them down.
Yeah.

1489
01:24:49.031 --> 01:24:52.780
Well if you hit it with this bumper,
deflects it to the left or to the right.

1490
01:24:52.950 --> 01:24:56.080
You know,
the idea is that you can really get fucked up by a deer,

1491
01:24:56.140 --> 01:25:00.160
especially in elk.
Do you hit an elk hills?
There are a moose,

1492
01:25:00.190 --> 01:25:01.570
Moose or mass.

1493
01:25:01.630 --> 01:25:06.250
I saw a huge pickup truck there that it hit him loose and it was,
it was mangled.

1494
01:25:06.251 --> 01:25:09.170
The whole big crush fall,
like a shoe.

1495
01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:13.150
Aluminum canners there's so huge man.
And they're so stupid in this bumper.

1496
01:25:13.570 --> 01:25:16.420
They had to go and I'm talking about,
is that what it's called?

1497
01:25:16.450 --> 01:25:20.500
I don't know now the deer slaughterer look at the big lights to on the front of

1498
01:25:20.501 --> 01:25:23.680
it.
That shit's also important.
Did you know semis?

1499
01:25:23.681 --> 01:25:27.250
The front tires of semis have like,
like spikes coming out of them.
What?

1500
01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:31.440
I'd never knew like the uh,
on the,
on the hubcap?
Yeah,
on the hub.

1501
01:25:31.450 --> 01:25:34.480
I've never noticed this before.
I just started noticing it yesterday.

1502
01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:38.230
They have like these Mad Max spinning or James Bond,
like not all of them.

1503
01:25:38.231 --> 01:25:41.770
I think that's like a,
a special,
that's like getting rims on your car.
You know,

1504
01:25:41.771 --> 01:25:44.660
if you're a trucker I think,
oh it's sexy.
But I noticed that like,

1505
01:25:44.710 --> 01:25:48.220
I noticed it yesterday and I noticed every truck in la at least has it and I won

1506
01:25:48.250 --> 01:25:52.170
is that just so if anyone tries to come over on them that they just like

1507
01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:56.960
destroyed the car before the semi,
before the semi loses its fire guys Mad Max.

1508
01:25:56.980 --> 01:25:59.920
Probably Pretty Smart.
I'd probably be like that rather than,
you know,

1509
01:25:59.921 --> 01:26:02.200
I'd rather your car get a little fucked up in this semi,

1510
01:26:02.201 --> 01:26:04.100
lose a tire and go careening into

1511
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:08.750
<v 4>a crowd.
Yeah.
I never noticed that prosthetic was mad max.
The road warrior.</v>

1512
01:26:08.890 --> 01:26:13.490
It's,
they're fighting each other for gasoline and comfortably as it gets closer,

1513
01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:18.520
big guy that I am the humongous and then his gay lover with the Mohawk gets the,

1514
01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:23.580
<v 0>uh,
bet,
whatever you call it,
the boomerang in the head.</v>

1515
01:26:23.610 --> 01:26:26.910
Remember that it could go that way.
If you,
uh,

1516
01:26:27.060 --> 01:26:31.440
if you look at parts of the world like Liberia where it's like a really badly

1517
01:26:31.441 --> 01:26:33.540
fucked up area of the world,
especially during the civil war,

1518
01:26:33.570 --> 01:26:35.010
which was not that long ago,

1519
01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:38.700
Liberia where we sent the freed slaves that wanted to go back to after I quit.

1520
01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:43.110
I mean horrific.
Their capital is Monrovia or you know a lot about Liberia.

1521
01:26:43.260 --> 01:26:44.790
I know a lot of them have watched that Vice.
Dot.

1522
01:26:44.791 --> 01:26:48.720
You are fucking international man.
You are Tom Rhodes.
Did you ever watch that?
Um,

1523
01:26:48.750 --> 01:26:53.640
vice guide to travel on Liberia.
The,
they covered that guy.
General button naked.

1524
01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:56.340
The guy who was a born again Christian,
who was killed,

1525
01:26:56.341 --> 01:26:59.970
thousands and thousands of people murdered children,
ate their heart and shit.

1526
01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.940
Wow.
Yeah.
Really intense civil war type shit.

1527
01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:06.330
And then became like a Christian found Jesus and apparently they like get them

1528
01:27:06.331 --> 01:27:09.720
off the a with a child's heart.
Do you drink red or white wine?

1529
01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:14.610
I think it just take it raw like a shot.
Well,
no ice.
Nothing.

1530
01:27:14.970 --> 01:27:18.240
Yeah.
It's,
it's,
it's so twisted that this guy gets to say,
I,
you know,

1531
01:27:18.241 --> 01:27:22.170
I found Jesus.
Now I'm good.
And they forgave and then all your sins are,
yeah.

1532
01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:25.230
I mean,
he's like a incredible war criminal and he used to fight naked.

1533
01:27:25.350 --> 01:27:27.910
Just took off all his clothes.
That's why you look like Arrow button naked.
Yeah.

1534
01:27:27.970 --> 01:27:30.240
That was just,
that was his deal.
Just kill people naked.

1535
01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:32.040
Tet personally responsible for the deaths.
Okay.

1536
01:27:32.070 --> 01:27:34.950
<v 4>I never thought I would actually watched this documentary last night.
Uh,</v>

1537
01:27:34.951 --> 01:27:38.760
and if you haven't seen it,
you should watch it.
It's called the century of self.

1538
01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:44.160
I have heard,
uh,
I like,
uh,
you know,
traveling all the time and uh,

1539
01:27:44.340 --> 01:27:46.490
I love watching like BBC documentaries,

1540
01:27:46.730 --> 01:27:50.400
but free online documentaries and this things called century of self.

1541
01:27:50.430 --> 01:27:52.860
And it's about this Guy Edward Bernays,

1542
01:27:52.861 --> 01:27:57.240
who was Sigmund Freud's nephew and he,
uh,

1543
01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:01.110
after World War One,
he wanted to do,
uh,

1544
01:28:01.140 --> 01:28:05.590
propaganda for a interested in controlling the masses,
but he changed,
uh,

1545
01:28:05.610 --> 01:28:09.510
propaganda to public relations.
And this guy did,
um,

1546
01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:13.400
he got like women to smoke,
like the women suffered,
suffered,

1547
01:28:13.401 --> 01:28:17.310
get music movement and women trying to vote.
Uh,

1548
01:28:17.610 --> 01:28:20.790
women didn't smoke cigarettes.
It was really a taboo thing.

1549
01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:25.530
And then he got these women delight up at this March and they called them

1550
01:28:25.531 --> 01:28:28.980
torches of freedom.
And then now we're equal to men.
We can smoke.

1551
01:28:28.981 --> 01:28:30.570
And just like a,

1552
01:28:30.571 --> 01:28:35.370
just all these things about manipulating the masses through,
um,
you know,

1553
01:28:35.371 --> 01:28:36.540
public relations.
And

1554
01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:39.640
<v 0>Yeah,
well they've been doing that since the get go.</v>

1555
01:28:39.641 --> 01:28:42.850
As soon as people figured out how to talk,
they figured out that they can lie,

1556
01:28:42.970 --> 01:28:43.803
you know,

1557
01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:46.720
you don't have to tell the truth and then they just get better and better at it.

1558
01:28:46.721 --> 01:28:48.400
And it evolved like everything else.

1559
01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:50.800
<v 4>Well it's interesting.
It's like a four part series.</v>

1560
01:28:50.801 --> 01:28:53.680
Like for it's like an hour each thing.
I think the BBC made it,

1561
01:28:53.681 --> 01:28:58.390
but then like the last episode is how it's used in politics.
How,
you know this,

1562
01:28:58.391 --> 01:29:02.070
uh,
the corporation's learned this at the turn of the,
you know,
how

1563
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:05.760
<v 6>they could,
cause people used to only buy things that they wanted,
uh,</v>

1564
01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:07.860
or that they needed.
And then now you know,

1565
01:29:07.870 --> 01:29:11.910
there to fulfill their selfish desires of,
you know,

1566
01:29:11.911 --> 01:29:13.950
this product will complete me.

1567
01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:16.500
<v 0>Well,
what happens is people get caught up in this,</v>

1568
01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:21.180
this materialism loop where that is the focus where it's constantly attaining

1569
01:29:21.181 --> 01:29:24.750
the newest objects,
become the focus and everything else becomes secondary.

1570
01:29:24.751 --> 01:29:28.380
It's like the focus is most on,
I got to get this new Ferrari,

1571
01:29:28.590 --> 01:29:32.700
there's a new Ferrari out the Ferrari two,
five,
eight Italia.
It is the shit.

1572
01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:36.780
I have this car,
it completes me.
I need this car,
I must have this car.

1573
01:29:37.020 --> 01:29:38.430
And then you get that car and you know,

1574
01:29:38.431 --> 01:29:40.890
you think now you think you're looking at Lamborghini's like Lamborghinis or

1575
01:29:40.891 --> 01:29:44.330
more bad ass.
And then,
you know,
you're looking at the fucking véronique and you,

1576
01:29:44.331 --> 01:29:48.330
you're getting crazy.
You're,
you're,
you're focusing on objects instead of actual,

1577
01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:49.170
I think suit of,

1578
01:29:49.170 --> 01:29:52.100
I think you're hanging out with a higher class of people than I not even talking

1579
01:29:52.110 --> 01:29:54.460
to.
I'm talking about any human being that does that.
I mean,

1580
01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:57.810
like real extreme materialists.
I mean,
I obviously took it,
uh,
you know,

1581
01:29:57.860 --> 01:30:00.180
I took it from Ferrari to it,
but it doesn't have to be that.

1582
01:30:00.181 --> 01:30:03.660
It can be a fucking Mustang.
It could be a new TV.
It could be a new computer.

1583
01:30:03.661 --> 01:30:08.160
It could be we somehow or another be can become obsessed with attaining some

1584
01:30:08.161 --> 01:30:12.420
sort of a new object.
The galaxy s three is out.
Have you tried it?
You know,

1585
01:30:12.421 --> 01:30:14.040
it becomes like the focus of your fucking day.

1586
01:30:14.041 --> 01:30:17.550
You're watching all these youtube reviews on the galaxy s three,
and you're like,

1587
01:30:17.551 --> 01:30:20.970
what the fuck am I doing?
I have a phone.
Why am I being so crazy?

1588
01:30:21.210 --> 01:30:23.820
What am I doing here?
Am I going to use all these features?

1589
01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:29.310
Have you seen the galaxy answer?
Who Cares?
Who Cares?
How dare you?

1590
01:30:29.610 --> 01:30:30.443
It looks pretty sporty.

1591
01:30:30.900 --> 01:30:33.810
It looks like those droid things to finally caught up to iPhones and they even

1592
01:30:33.811 --> 01:30:37.000
passed him in a lot of ways.
Nope,
you don't think so?
Yeah.
Like you,

1593
01:30:37.090 --> 01:30:38.070
like if you paid attention,

1594
01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:41.680
<v 6>Jude,
just,
just being after shows,
getting,
you know,</v>

1595
01:30:41.681 --> 01:30:45.700
talking to all these people that have their different phones and asking them

1596
01:30:46.030 --> 01:30:49.210
every,
every single time I go,
so do you like it?
Do you like a lot?
And he goes,

1597
01:30:49.211 --> 01:30:54.070
yeah,
I mean I want an iPhone,
but I just can't afford it.
And I'm like,

1598
01:30:54.071 --> 01:30:57.160
I get that,
you know,
that's cool.
You can't afford it.
It is more expensive.

1599
01:30:57.161 --> 01:31:01.000
But what really sucks is just like using these people's cameras,

1600
01:31:01.001 --> 01:31:03.910
like the cause of everyone wants to take a photo and stuff so you get to seed

1601
01:31:03.911 --> 01:31:05.170
like photo afterwards.

1602
01:31:05.171 --> 01:31:10.171
So we pretty much are the best Beta testers or just a to play with shows for

1603
01:31:10.391 --> 01:31:13.650
cell phones.
And every time I'm like real pretty interested.
Like,

1604
01:31:13.660 --> 01:31:16.240
let me see what the photo looks like.
You know,
let's do this.
And it's,

1605
01:31:16.450 --> 01:31:17.890
it's always shit shit.

1606
01:31:18.190 --> 01:31:20.680
<v 0>Especially like those,
uh,
those sprint ones,</v>

1607
01:31:20.890 --> 01:31:24.880
those HTCs are fucking terrible.
It's all blurred out and shit.

1608
01:31:25.060 --> 01:31:26.640
But I'll tell you,
um,

1609
01:31:26.650 --> 01:31:30.520
I did see someone take a picture with one of those galaxy threes and it was bad

1610
01:31:30.521 --> 01:31:31.060
ass.

1611
01:31:31.060 --> 01:31:33.730
<v 6>I mean,
I,
I wouldn't,
if somebody gave me one,
I would use it for a month.</v>

1612
01:31:33.731 --> 01:31:34.830
And you know,
there's a commercial

1613
01:31:35.070 --> 01:31:39.650
<v 0>no,
that note that.
Um,
have you seen the,
um,
the,
the,
the note,
it's called a second.</v>

1614
01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:40.710
What is it?
A Samsung note?

1615
01:31:40.750 --> 01:31:44.590
<v 6>Yeah.
It's just like a scene.
It's a smaller iPads.
It's ridiculous.</v>

1616
01:31:45.470 --> 01:31:48.410
<v 0>It looks awesome.
Fits in your pocket.
It's the shit.
I'm like,
I gotta get one.</v>

1617
01:31:48.411 --> 01:31:49.244
I must have it.

1618
01:31:49.290 --> 01:31:50.460
<v 6>See what's weird now like traveling,</v>

1619
01:31:50.461 --> 01:31:54.360
I just spent two months playing all over Europe and uh,
I had a week off.

1620
01:31:54.361 --> 01:31:59.361
I went to Rome and you see people with their I pads and

1621
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:02.620
<v 8>taking them around and taking photos,
videos.</v>

1622
01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:07.390
It's really weird to be like the coliseum and see somebody,
the new big ass iPad.

1623
01:32:07.391 --> 01:32:10.900
Yeah,
the new iPads camera in it is really,
really good.
Is it really?

1624
01:32:10.901 --> 01:32:14.540
What is a how many megabytes?
Hd Video Camera.
Well then that exists.

1625
01:32:15.450 --> 01:32:18.320
So it's,
that's minimal,
but they're there.
You know,

1626
01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:21.430
it's a skinny little thing and it's got an awesome,
you know,
it,
it's,

1627
01:32:21.431 --> 01:32:24.130
it's 96 degrees in Rome.

1628
01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:28.960
It's hot and especially the coliseum and the ancient ruins.
And you got this,

1629
01:32:29.290 --> 01:32:31.510
you know,
uh,
electronics don't like moisture,

1630
01:32:31.940 --> 01:32:32.301
<v 0>right?</v>

1631
01:32:32.301 --> 01:32:35.780
But if you did have one of those things and you were walking around with it like

1632
01:32:35.781 --> 01:32:38.660
that,
they,
they,
they know what the fuck they're doing when they make these,

1633
01:32:38.810 --> 01:32:40.370
they're not going to fuck up with moisture,

1634
01:32:40.490 --> 01:32:42.130
but you're going to get some amazing pictures.

1635
01:32:42.131 --> 01:32:45.140
You're you to be able to see it on a big screen,
a big iPad screen.

1636
01:32:45.410 --> 01:32:47.990
I could see that because a lot of times you take a picture of something as

1637
01:32:47.991 --> 01:32:50.900
spectacular as the coliseum.
You don't exactly know what you got.

1638
01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:53.630
Have you taken with an Ipad,
you know exactly what you got.

1639
01:32:53.631 --> 01:32:56.210
That's kind of bad ass to think of just that alone.

1640
01:32:56.450 --> 01:32:59.390
If they eventually get it to a point where you don't need a real camera,

1641
01:32:59.450 --> 01:33:02.720
like they can get the the technology down.
I don't know if it's really possible.

1642
01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:05.290
We don't need extending lens or anything nutty like that.

1643
01:33:05.390 --> 01:33:07.850
That would be the perfect thing.
You take pictures with an Ipad,

1644
01:33:07.940 --> 01:33:09.440
you can see what the fuck your picture looks like.

1645
01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:12.660
<v 8>I think the,
that we're going to see what the next iPhone is.</v>

1646
01:33:12.661 --> 01:33:16.170
A another smaller note.
Do you think so type IPAD,

1647
01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:18.690
there's already been a lot of rumors that they're going to have like a seven

1648
01:33:18.691 --> 01:33:19.381
inch iPad,

1649
01:33:19.381 --> 01:33:22.560
which it would be kind of like around the notes size or is it seven inches?

1650
01:33:22.590 --> 01:33:25.470
I don't know.
I don't have no idea,
but I just compare everything to my deck.

1651
01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:27.340
There's bigger than that.

1652
01:33:27.630 --> 01:33:31.670
It's about half the size of it and I know my Dick is bigger than this right
here.

1653
01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:35.030
It's really incredible that,
you know,
just to have the,
you know,

1654
01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:37.740
access to all of human knowledge in your hand.

1655
01:33:37.741 --> 01:33:39.180
Like we were talking before we started,
like,

1656
01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:42.510
it's a great thing about smart phones is you're talking to somebody now and

1657
01:33:42.511 --> 01:33:46.950
you're like,
oh,
what's the fastest bird?
Uh,
uh,
yeah.
I mean it's like the,

1658
01:33:47.010 --> 01:33:49.170
or somebody at a bar talking shit,
you know,

1659
01:33:49.171 --> 01:33:53.910
and you can cannonball one cannon ball three won best actor.
Whether you're like,

1660
01:33:53.911 --> 01:33:56.520
yeah,
fuck you,
let's go to the answer machine and you look it up.

1661
01:33:56.550 --> 01:33:59.460
We love doing that on the podcast is the coolest thing.
When you were like,

1662
01:33:59.461 --> 01:34:01.080
who the fuck do you,
was that one right?
Like I was saying,

1663
01:34:01.530 --> 01:34:04.860
but like I was saying about the torture songs.
Exactly.
I mean,
remember years ago,

1664
01:34:04.861 --> 01:34:08.570
like if you needed to like make a phone call and you're driving on the highway,

1665
01:34:08.571 --> 01:34:12.720
you had to like get off on the exit,
find a pay phone with aids on it,

1666
01:34:13.780 --> 01:34:15.900
uh,
you know,
call some number,
right.
Where you really

1667
01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:19.340
<v 0>worried that you could possibly catch aids from a phone.
You know,</v>

1668
01:34:19.341 --> 01:34:21.920
like when aids first came out,
you're like,
what if it's on this?

1669
01:34:21.950 --> 01:34:24.060
What if the agent is on things?
Like,
what if it's like the flu,

1670
01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:28.480
<v 8>right?
Yeah.
I remember like in it like recently it's come out,
uh,
the,
the in the,</v>

1671
01:34:28.481 --> 01:34:33.010
in the news that,
you know,
we're,
we're kind of close not to eradicating it fully,

1672
01:34:33.011 --> 01:34:37.420
but like to really minimizing it,
um,
where it's not a threat to the,

1673
01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:41.440
to the whole human population.
Like what,
when we were teenagers,

1674
01:34:41.441 --> 01:34:42.980
Jesus that came out and yeah.

1675
01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:47.300
<v 0>Do you remember when Kennison came out with a joke about it?
He goes,
okay.</v>

1676
01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:51.610
<v 9>He goes,
oh yeah.
They say,
Sam Hayes is a communicable disease.</v>

1677
01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:53.890
Heterosexual people die with too.
He goes,

1678
01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:57.590
name on fucking guy.

1679
01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:00.080
It's not our dance.

1680
01:35:00.610 --> 01:35:03.500
<v 2>I'm like,
whoa.
Holy Shit.</v>

1681
01:35:04.610 --> 01:35:09.290
Sam was the best.
He was my favorite ever.
Sam was great man.
Who's the best,

1682
01:35:09.730 --> 01:35:13.160
he's the most to me,
the,
I mean,
Richard Pryor's probably really the best,

1683
01:35:13.161 --> 01:35:17.000
but Sam was one of my favorites.
I mean right up there with prior to me,

1684
01:35:17.740 --> 01:35:19.040
just like,
just not,
I mean,

1685
01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:22.950
if you have to like say who's the better comments and those priorities,

1686
01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:25.570
the front yard doing,
working on the yard,

1687
01:35:26.100 --> 01:35:29.690
just shoot me dry run or just kill me.

1688
01:35:30.020 --> 01:35:31.130
I'm in hell.

1689
01:35:31.620 --> 01:35:35.060
You got to say prioritize better because Sam would have never been Sam if prior

1690
01:35:35.061 --> 01:35:38.900
heading to come first.
You know,
they,
you had to have a guy like that,

1691
01:35:38.901 --> 01:35:41.780
like prior had to have a guy like Lenny Bruce,
you know,

1692
01:35:41.810 --> 01:35:43.500
Sam had to have a guy like prior.
Yeah.

1693
01:35:43.501 --> 01:35:44.870
You have to somebody who shows you the way,

1694
01:35:44.871 --> 01:35:48.230
like every one of us is sort of piggy backing on everybody else's,
you know,

1695
01:35:48.231 --> 01:35:51.500
we're all sort of Hicks,
disciples and some sort of a way.
Right.
But I mean,

1696
01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:55.240
I remember doing comedy in Florida at first few years and you know,
um,

1697
01:35:55.630 --> 01:35:59.570
there was just a lot of bland,
generic,
you know,
white guys.
And then Florida,

1698
01:35:59.571 --> 01:36:01.430
there was a lot of New York,
uh,
acts,

1699
01:36:01.431 --> 01:36:04.890
it would come down in the winter and they are all like,
you know,
uh,

1700
01:36:05.010 --> 01:36:08.300
they did a lot of talking to the crowd and,
you know,
hey,
you know,

1701
01:36:08.301 --> 01:36:11.390
when you're on the subway,
no,
we're in Florida.
We don't have a subway.

1702
01:36:11.770 --> 01:36:13.170
Well that's city.
God I remember,

1703
01:36:13.290 --> 01:36:15.530
but I remember that it was just like this kind of,
um,

1704
01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:20.360
kinda eighties hacking enos.
And then,
uh,
it was the comedian Ron Bennington,

1705
01:36:20.361 --> 01:36:22.610
he's on Sirius now.
Love Ron Ben.

1706
01:36:22.611 --> 01:36:26.000
He was like the first beast of a comedian I saw.

1707
01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:28.040
He was so brilliant,
man.

1708
01:36:28.041 --> 01:36:32.540
Like the first guy I ever saw talking about like things that mattered and I saw

1709
01:36:32.541 --> 01:36:34.100
him and that like opened my eyes like,
wow,

1710
01:36:34.101 --> 01:36:37.750
you can actually talk about shit that matters.
And then,
um,

1711
01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:42.070
maybe a year later or something Kinison exploded.
And like,

1712
01:36:42.110 --> 01:36:46.010
those were the first two guys I saw where I was like,
wow,
this is,

1713
01:36:46.011 --> 01:36:50.420
you can approach this.
You don't have to,
uh,
you know,
pander to the,

1714
01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:53.540
to the masses.
You can talk about real shit that matters.

1715
01:36:53.630 --> 01:36:56.810
Heard about Kennison from a girl I was working with was a chick I worked with

1716
01:36:56.820 --> 01:37:00.140
the Boston Athletic Club.
She saw Kinison on Hbo.

1717
01:37:00.141 --> 01:37:03.980
She said it was so fun and she came to work the next day and was was reenacting

1718
01:37:04.010 --> 01:37:09.010
his bit about the homosexual necrophilia acts were having sex with the gay with

1719
01:37:09.111 --> 01:37:12.800
the dead corpses.
Oh,
it was really funny.
She was doing it in the parking lot.

1720
01:37:12.801 --> 01:37:16.610
It was so funny watching her do it that I had a checkout Kennison and that was,

1721
01:37:16.670 --> 01:37:19.730
I was 19 and that was the first seed that was planted in my head.

1722
01:37:19.731 --> 01:37:22.310
I remember thinking like,
Whoa,
like this is comedy too.

1723
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:27.470
I never thought this could be like this guy was for folks who don't understand,

1724
01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:31.250
but for Kennison came along,
there was nothing even remotely like that.

1725
01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:34.360
A guy who just would scream just like,

1726
01:37:35.970 --> 01:37:37.230
<v 9>yeah,
I was married.</v>

1727
01:37:40.110 --> 01:37:41.700
I hope you slide that club,
man.

1728
01:37:41.701 --> 01:37:46.701
I hope you slide your door a gas truck and takes your own [inaudible].

1729
01:37:47.690 --> 01:37:48.840
It's fine.
His

1730
01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:51.090
<v 2>pain was so awesome.
It was like,</v>

1731
01:37:51.091 --> 01:37:54.570
here's this guy who was just so completely different than anybody had ever seen

1732
01:37:54.571 --> 01:37:56.370
before.
A former preacher,

1733
01:37:56.490 --> 01:38:01.260
<v 3>he's fat short and cares all fucked up.
He wears a hat,
he wears a bra,</v>

1734
01:38:01.290 --> 01:38:04.670
totally confident,
covers his body in a trench coat,

1735
01:38:04.671 --> 01:38:08.520
walks on the stage with sneakers on and just just dominates.

1736
01:38:08.521 --> 01:38:11.220
You just dominates the room from the moment he gives us that,

1737
01:38:11.221 --> 01:38:13.020
you can't wait to hear what this guy's going to say.
No.

1738
01:38:13.150 --> 01:38:14.110
<v 8>Oh my God.
And then like,
you know,</v>

1739
01:38:14.111 --> 01:38:17.600
in Florida and the southern United States or areas,
so like,
you know,

1740
01:38:17.630 --> 01:38:22.130
I'm heavy Christian,
Jesus freaks and that stuff.
He would,
you know,

1741
01:38:22.131 --> 01:38:24.370
be talking about Jesus jokes about,
you know,

1742
01:38:24.630 --> 01:38:28.020
<v 3>well he had the most cloud of anybody who was an actual cause.
He was a pastor.</v>

1743
01:38:28.021 --> 01:38:31.470
Yeah.
So for,
they couldn't fuck with them when it came to like biblical verses.

1744
01:38:31.471 --> 01:38:34.440
And should he get away with shit that a guy like you or I might not and you
know,

1745
01:38:34.441 --> 01:38:37.000
might not be able to pull things out of it.
He pulled the vedic,

1746
01:38:37.001 --> 01:38:41.250
gets out of his ass,
he fucking taught it,
which is amazing.

1747
01:38:41.251 --> 01:38:44.790
It's just what a what a crazy life.
You know,

1748
01:38:44.791 --> 01:38:46.500
they say he was normal until he got hit by a car.

1749
01:38:47.190 --> 01:38:49.560
Don't really see it as a really shy kid.
Got Hit by a car,

1750
01:38:49.561 --> 01:38:52.170
became a completely different person.
His book,

1751
01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:55.140
his brother wrote a book about it called on my brother Sam.

1752
01:38:55.230 --> 01:38:57.640
Not a book about his whole life,
but about the,

1753
01:38:58.230 --> 01:39:01.980
I think it was a truck that hit him when he was a little boy and it just,

1754
01:39:02.010 --> 01:39:05.910
whatever pops up and loose and away we go.

1755
01:39:06.210 --> 01:39:10.110
We got Sam Kinison in the world of comedy has changed by maybe a kid getting hit

1756
01:39:10.111 --> 01:39:12.480
by a truck,
you know,
that might have been what it was.

1757
01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:15.900
They say a lot of times when people get head trauma,
they get really reckless.

1758
01:39:15.901 --> 01:39:16.734
They get crazy.

1759
01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:19.870
<v 8>Yeah.
Well there's that famous,
a psychological thing.
It was,</v>

1760
01:39:19.871 --> 01:39:22.990
I think it was in Connecticut or New Hampshire or something like in the,

1761
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:25.300
like a hundred years ago.

1762
01:39:25.301 --> 01:39:27.640
Some guy who was a really nice guy in the village and he,

1763
01:39:27.910 --> 01:39:32.910
he was at work and this big metal pole went through his brain and he lived and

1764
01:39:34.571 --> 01:39:35.910
something happened to him where he like,

1765
01:39:35.911 --> 01:39:39.040
his whole personality changed where he became like,
just like a,

1766
01:39:39.041 --> 01:39:43.440
a huge alcoholic asshole.
Really mean guy or just this,

1767
01:39:43.441 --> 01:39:46.120
a brain trauma just completely changed his personality.

1768
01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:46.401
<v 3>Well,</v>

1769
01:39:46.401 --> 01:39:49.820
there was a story in one of those London tabloids and then some people get hit

1770
01:39:49.821 --> 01:39:52.760
and then they speak fluent French.
I don't know if the story was true,

1771
01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:55.100
but there was a guy who,
uh,

1772
01:39:55.130 --> 01:39:58.190
was a rugby player and something happened to him.

1773
01:39:58.191 --> 01:40:00.920
He got knocked unconscious and you don't believe it.

1774
01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:04.530
<v 8>We talked about this before and we looked at photos and he looked gay before</v>

1775
01:40:04.620 --> 01:40:07.740
also see that he was like on the fence.

1776
01:40:09.330 --> 01:40:10.163
Well that's what they,

1777
01:40:10.700 --> 01:40:14.030
<v 3>he says that it made them gay and he woke up and you know,</v>

1778
01:40:14.031 --> 01:40:15.590
he had no desire to be with women anymore.

1779
01:40:17.050 --> 01:40:20.630
<v 8>Number eight under the government was working on that like gay bomb.
Yes.</v>

1780
01:40:20.750 --> 01:40:24.400
Would it have been great if that would have worked?
I mean great.

1781
01:40:24.401 --> 01:40:27.520
Like all our enemies,
we just dropped this gay bomb on him and we were going,

1782
01:40:27.521 --> 01:40:28.990
everybody starts making out.

1783
01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:33.690
That would be that they couldn't have perfected that turn Iraq into a big just

1784
01:40:34.150 --> 01:40:37.650
gay bar.
Just a big gay hoedown.
They changed their,

1785
01:40:37.810 --> 01:40:39.730
their national anthem to it's raining men.

1786
01:40:39.910 --> 01:40:43.480
<v 3>What a ridiculous idea that they thought they were going to develop a bog gate</v>

1787
01:40:43.481 --> 01:40:45.910
box that you could check off and it would turn people,

1788
01:40:45.970 --> 01:40:49.180
the turn the soldiers on themselves and the idea was be that it would kill

1789
01:40:49.181 --> 01:40:51.640
morale because they would just be bought fucking each other in the trenches and

1790
01:40:51.641 --> 01:40:54.160
they would just give up.
When we came with guns,
they probably did

1791
01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:55.720
<v 8>create it and they probably let it loose,</v>

1792
01:40:55.750 --> 01:40:58.810
but it's such a homophobic idea because you're saying that a man is,

1793
01:40:58.870 --> 01:41:03.460
is in capable of fighting if he's been kind of become,
becomes a homosexual.

1794
01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:06.210
That's the idea is that you moralize them.
Yeah.
I mean,

1795
01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:10.640
I think it made like men instantly desirable was the thing.
Well,
yeah,

1796
01:41:10.660 --> 01:41:13.570
but also the idea was that they would be demoralized,

1797
01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:17.560
they would start having sex with their,
their,
you know,
coworkers.

1798
01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:18.730
That was the idea.

1799
01:41:18.730 --> 01:41:23.230
Like that was so by [inaudible] pretty prevalent in the Middle East.
Anyway,

1800
01:41:23.231 --> 01:41:27.370
I think they say men boys or for fun.
Women are for procreation.
Yeah,

1801
01:41:27.550 --> 01:41:29.740
I've heard that before.
Is that really true?
Yeah,
I think there's a,

1802
01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:33.970
that's a big deal.
I know people in Afghanistan,
I've,
I've talked to,

1803
01:41:34.070 --> 01:41:36.580
I talk to my brother was over there and that's,
yeah,

1804
01:41:36.581 --> 01:41:41.560
that's a very common to what I heard.
Yeah.
That's a mess.
Yeah.

1805
01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:46.140
There's a lot of the,
of the world's really fucking a lot of,
yeah.
And then,

1806
01:41:46.150 --> 01:41:49.850
you know,
you talk to people and they're complaining here.
It's like,
oh,
player.

1807
01:41:49.860 --> 01:41:54.790
Nice Pasadena.
Nice.
It is out here.
Yeah.
It's ridiculous,

1808
01:41:54.791 --> 01:41:57.880
isn't it?
So there's parts of the world where the apocalypse exists.

1809
01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:02.170
It's going on right now.
I did a Gig in east Donia country dropper,

1810
01:42:02.620 --> 01:42:06.370
uh,
about a month and a half ago and it's really cool up there.

1811
01:42:06.371 --> 01:42:10.300
It's right underneath Finland and um,

1812
01:42:11.140 --> 01:42:16.140
it's the second least religious country in the world after China really.

1813
01:42:16.630 --> 01:42:19.090
And it looks,
it looks like Hitler's wet dream up there.

1814
01:42:19.091 --> 01:42:21.580
Everybody's just tall and blonde and really good looking.

1815
01:42:21.890 --> 01:42:26.830
A Skype was developed in east Donia apparently,
and it really interesting,

1816
01:42:26.890 --> 01:42:31.790
um,
cool people and very intelligent people.
It was awesome to,
um,

1817
01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:37.240
perform there.
What was the point in this story?
It doesn't matter.
Uh,

1818
01:42:37.241 --> 01:42:39.330
east Odeon was awesome.
Oh No,

1819
01:42:40.410 --> 01:42:44.210
that's the second least a religious country in the world.
Then there was like a,

1820
01:42:44.220 --> 01:42:48.910
I get in the,
in the main square,
in a,
in,
in Estonia,

1821
01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:50.313
um,

1822
01:42:50.380 --> 01:42:55.210
there was this church choir of young teenagers and there they were singing like,

1823
01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:58.630
you know,
happy praise Jesus songs.
And somebody gave,
uh,

1824
01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:02.440
gave me a pamphlet and they were going to the church and I'm filming stuff

1825
01:43:02.441 --> 01:43:05.170
constantly in my,
in my travels,
cause I like,
you know,

1826
01:43:05.230 --> 01:43:09.280
I'm obsessed with making these little youtube travel videos and stuff and

1827
01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:14.500
channel,
uh,
King of Haha or Haha,
just Tom Rhodes search Tom Rhodes,
it'll pop.

1828
01:43:14.501 --> 01:43:19.060
R,
h,
o,
d and uh,
these kids were from Pasadena.

1829
01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:22.990
They're like,
Eh,
I couldn't believe it.
They were from Pasadenan,
you know,

1830
01:43:23.110 --> 01:43:25.810
Baptist Church or whatever,
and they were in Estonia.

1831
01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:28.270
He's stony in converting souls.
Oh.

1832
01:43:28.271 --> 01:43:31.840
Also they were already missionaries singing happy Jesus songs in the main
square.

1833
01:43:32.050 --> 01:43:32.980
We had a kid on the,

1834
01:43:32.981 --> 01:43:37.981
a fear factor wants that was a missionary and he would go over to South America

1835
01:43:38.530 --> 01:43:42.370
and try to convert people.
Yeah.
Like they would,
uh,
they would go there.

1836
01:43:42.371 --> 01:43:46.030
He was a Mormon Mormon missionary,

1837
01:43:47.030 --> 01:43:50.980
kind of crazy show up and really poor places.
And you know,
listen,

1838
01:43:50.990 --> 01:43:52.700
I know you live in a really hot jungle,

1839
01:43:52.730 --> 01:43:54.760
but would you consider wearing these under way?

1840
01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:56.960
<v 0>I want to tell you about a man named Joseph Smith.</v>

1841
01:43:57.300 --> 01:44:02.000
He's 14 years old and he found golden tablets that were the last work of Jesus

1842
01:44:02.001 --> 01:44:04.160
and only he could read them because he had a magic rock.

1843
01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:08.330
<v 8>Anyway.
Well,
I wasn't the,
wasn't there a talking lizard?
No,
it was a seer stone.</v>

1844
01:44:08.690 --> 01:44:11.830
He looked through a seer stone.
A stone.
A magic stone maybe was,

1845
01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:15.230
I thought that was a talking to like a white salamander or something.
Really?

1846
01:44:15.470 --> 01:44:18.330
Maybe.
Yeah.
Maybe that too,
but I didn't last works.

1847
01:44:18.331 --> 01:44:22.850
And the Mormons believe that black people did not go to heaven until they got an

1848
01:44:22.851 --> 01:44:27.650
NBA team.
And then I'm like,
I think like what I said true.

1849
01:44:27.651 --> 01:44:30.480
Apparently I'll tell you why they don't like the until like,
you know,

1850
01:44:30.481 --> 01:44:34.430
like the mid seventies,
they,
Mormons are really nice people.

1851
01:44:34.490 --> 01:44:35.720
That's one of the things that they're really,

1852
01:44:35.721 --> 01:44:39.660
their religion does do is it supports a sense of community,
uh,

1853
01:44:39.810 --> 01:44:40.940
supports banding together.

1854
01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:45.830
That's the Mormons I know are extremely a good quality people.

1855
01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:49.010
<v 0>Well,
I have some friends that are Mormons and you have never met and they're,</v>

1856
01:44:49.100 --> 01:44:52.020
they're wealthy.
You have never met more charitable people.
They've had,

1857
01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:55.240
they've literally had homeless people stay on their property like that.

1858
01:44:55.241 --> 01:44:58.520
And then they're wealthy people.
They bring in people off the street and they're,

1859
01:44:58.521 --> 01:45:02.190
they're constantly trying to provide anyone who's connected with the church,

1860
01:45:02.191 --> 01:45:05.730
with a,
a means to a better life,
to give people jobs.
They help people out.

1861
01:45:05.731 --> 01:45:09.120
They drive people to the airport.
I mean,
they're like,
they're super charitable,

1862
01:45:09.121 --> 01:45:09.730
nice people.

1863
01:45:09.730 --> 01:45:12.330
<v 8>Right.
And I think that a genealogy,
um,</v>

1864
01:45:12.580 --> 01:45:16.090
library of Congress they have in Salt Lake City is like the most comprehensive,

1865
01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:19.180
um,
tracking of ancestry on the planet.

1866
01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:21.130
<v 0>It's too bad you can't have that,</v>

1867
01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:25.330
have this idea of being a Mormon without all the looney tooney shit.
It's like,

1868
01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:27.970
can we just have like a sense of community and being cool to each other and nice

1869
01:45:27.971 --> 01:45:32.560
to each other and all be based on love and not have all this wacky Joseph Smith

1870
01:45:32.561 --> 01:45:36.640
from 1820 shit where it's like what?
Golden tablets?
No,
that,

1871
01:45:36.820 --> 01:45:41.170
this is not the law.
The American Indians are not a lost tribe of Israel.
No,

1872
01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:45.370
they're not.
That's crazy.
Like they already checked.
They've done like day,

1873
01:45:45.371 --> 01:45:49.420
like a guy who was a Mormon,
spent a fuck load of money to get the,
the,
the,

1874
01:45:49.570 --> 01:45:52.990
you know,
the DNA mapped of the American Indian.
It's all there.

1875
01:45:52.991 --> 01:45:55.510
Asians that come from side,
they're tall coming down from the,

1876
01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:58.150
<v 8>it's amazing that they can test DNA until we're,</v>

1877
01:45:58.151 --> 01:46:02.140
all of your ancestry comes from and what parts of the world.
It's amazing.

1878
01:46:02.140 --> 01:46:06.520
<v 0>Did you see that shit they found in Antarctica?
Did you see the Shit Brown?
No,</v>

1879
01:46:06.700 --> 01:46:08.770
they found a fucking rain for it.

1880
01:46:08.820 --> 01:46:12.900
<v 8>Send her the ice in Antarctica.
Wow.
Workshop.
Yeah,
Dude.</v>

1881
01:46:12.901 --> 01:46:16.160
Antarctica used to be a Gundam rainforest.
That's awesome.
Yeah,

1882
01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:20.370
they're gonna find any like animals there that are frozen.
Well,
I mean you're

1883
01:46:20.370 --> 01:46:23.040
<v 0>talking about miles of ice.
I mean,
I think they're just,</v>

1884
01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:25.990
they're just starting to dig into certain spots on it.
And I'm,

1885
01:46:26.020 --> 01:46:29.430
I'm gonna try to find it here because it's,
it's a really amazing story,

1886
01:46:29.730 --> 01:46:33.180
but they're saying that it used to be like 75 fucking degrees there.

1887
01:46:33.181 --> 01:46:37.530
It was like a Pacific northwest.
It was like fucking,
you know,

1888
01:46:37.531 --> 01:46:39.180
it was like living in a,
in,

1889
01:46:39.181 --> 01:46:43.200
in Oregon or Seattle or something like that and that this was what Antarctica

1890
01:46:43.230 --> 01:46:45.210
was like a certain amount of time ago.

1891
01:46:46.110 --> 01:46:48.030
It's amazing when you really stop to think about that,

1892
01:46:48.031 --> 01:46:51.570
that people were living there at some point in time,
you know,

1893
01:46:51.571 --> 01:46:53.540
like primitive people,
no doubt.
But,

1894
01:46:53.780 --> 01:46:54.960
and then they had to get the fuck out of there.

1895
01:46:54.961 --> 01:46:58.890
The whole thing changed way before anybody invented cars way before any of that

1896
01:46:58.891 --> 01:46:59.310
shit.

1897
01:46:59.310 --> 01:46:59.551
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

1898
01:46:59.551 --> 01:47:04.551
It says a once covered by less vegetarian poem like trees waved in the breeze.

1899
01:47:07.270 --> 01:47:10.820
<v 0>Yeah.
What,
that's fucking nuts man.
I mean,</v>

1900
01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:14.060
wrap your fucking head around that man.

1901
01:47:14.070 --> 01:47:18.160
I need to visit the little podcasters get in their fellow go down there and to

1902
01:47:18.161 --> 01:47:22.090
the left last door on the left.
And that's cool.
Yeah,
it's amazing man.

1903
01:47:22.300 --> 01:47:26.860
But I think they,
they suspected this,
a lot of um,
scientist suspect this,

1904
01:47:26.861 --> 01:47:30.460
we actually talked about this on the icehouse chronicles,
the uh,
the maps.

1905
01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:33.940
They have these uh,
really old maps from like the 15 hundreds,

1906
01:47:34.420 --> 01:47:38.350
I forget the name of the map,
but uh,
there's a map of Antarctica that they,

1907
01:47:38.351 --> 01:47:41.890
it's completely unexplained.
Hold on a second.
Angry ancient map.

1908
01:47:43.170 --> 01:47:44.130
<v 10>Okay.
And Artico</v>

1909
01:47:45.180 --> 01:47:46.740
<v 6>by the way,
a Birdie Stevens,</v>

1910
01:47:46.741 --> 01:47:50.520
new TV show on HBO go comes out August six.

1911
01:47:50.550 --> 01:47:54.660
And if everyone just downloads it and watches it occurred,
give Brody,

1912
01:47:54.661 --> 01:47:58.120
but I think we're in it.
I think they right from Brody dark podcast.
Yeah.

1913
01:47:58.121 --> 01:48:02.670
So they came here and they used to also used a lot of footage from when I used

1914
01:48:02.671 --> 01:48:06.330
to use stream with him at right before his meltdown.
So I think their youth,

1915
01:48:06.370 --> 01:48:09.510
they used a lot of that stuff.
Oh,
the craziest stuff.
Yeah.
Beautiful.

1916
01:48:09.570 --> 01:48:10.890
It's called Brody Stevens.
Enjoy it.

1917
01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:15.860
<v 0>Pull up.
Um,
uh,
an ancient map of Antarctica.
Pull that shit up.
Pull off.</v>

1918
01:48:15.940 --> 01:48:18.790
There's a Google image search.
It's amazing.

1919
01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:25.530
Antarctica.
See there's a lot of shit about the past that we probably don't know.

1920
01:48:25.740 --> 01:48:29.130
I mean,
how much do we really know about anything more than 10,000 years old?

1921
01:48:29.131 --> 01:48:29.970
Not a lot.

1922
01:48:30.030 --> 01:48:34.130
It's a lot of fucking sketchy information out there when it comes to the,
the,

1923
01:48:34.830 --> 01:48:37.470
the history of humanity.
But this a map,

1924
01:48:37.650 --> 01:48:41.890
I believe it's from the 15 hundreds and um,

1925
01:48:43.510 --> 01:48:46.680
go do a Google image search.
Yeah.
That's uh,
yeah.

1926
01:48:46.681 --> 01:48:49.590
I believe it's from the 1500 centers have Indiana Jones.

1927
01:48:49.650 --> 01:48:53.580
Let's complete mystery because we didn't discover Antarctica until,

1928
01:48:53.581 --> 01:48:55.530
I believe it was the 18 hundreds,

1929
01:48:55.650 --> 01:48:57.630
cause it was just completely frozen and covered at nice.

1930
01:48:57.930 --> 01:49:02.930
But these motherfuckers from the 15 hundreds had a correct map of the outline of

1931
01:49:03.331 --> 01:49:07.860
Antarctica.
They knew where it was.
They knew what it looked like.
Fucking nuts,

1932
01:49:07.861 --> 01:49:11.020
man.
We don't know how.
I think there's a lot of this shit.
They're,
they're,

1933
01:49:11.030 --> 01:49:13.710
they're,
they're too arrogant with their placing of,

1934
01:49:13.740 --> 01:49:18.150
of the time that history was invented in the time that civilization was
invented.

1935
01:49:18.390 --> 01:49:22.140
I think they got a little stuck on their timeline and now the shit is shifting

1936
01:49:22.141 --> 01:49:27.040
like really,
really radically like far back,
like a recent,
um,
uh,

1937
01:49:27.090 --> 01:49:29.460
discovery in Africa.
I think they pushed the,

1938
01:49:29.461 --> 01:49:33.780
the start of civilization back another 20,000 years.
It's pretty nuts,
man.

1939
01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:37.050
Stop and think about how fucking long ago that was,

1940
01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:40.770
there was nothing blink of an eye that,
to this,

1941
01:49:41.850 --> 01:49:46.800
that to Tom Rhodes on the Internet right now and performing the Ice House Comedy

1942
01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:49.600
Club here in lovely downtown Pasadena.

1943
01:49:49.890 --> 01:49:54.010
<v 8>I SAS company.com for tickets.
Tom Rhodes.
Dot.
Net profit on roads.</v>

1944
01:49:54.910 --> 01:49:57.790
Where are you based out of now?
These shoes?
I don't live anywhere.

1945
01:49:57.791 --> 01:50:01.150
I've had everything in storage for like six years and just travel constantly.

1946
01:50:01.270 --> 01:50:05.920
Wow.
That's weird.
That's a trouble with your wife.
Yeah,

1947
01:50:05.921 --> 01:50:09.760
she travels with me.
Oh,
that's bad ass.
She's,
she's in Holland right now.

1948
01:50:10.180 --> 01:50:13.000
Uh,
when we,
uh,

1949
01:50:13.690 --> 01:50:17.290
Jeez European.
So to get the green card,
you had to,

1950
01:50:17.350 --> 01:50:20.980
she couldn't leave the country for a year.
And then,
um,

1951
01:50:21.190 --> 01:50:23.740
I just did two months all over Europe and she was with me.

1952
01:50:24.220 --> 01:50:28.660
And so she's visiting her mommy working on her stuff.
And so you just go,

1953
01:50:28.661 --> 01:50:31.050
you don't,
you guys don't have a house anywhere,
you don't know.

1954
01:50:31.051 --> 01:50:34.180
And then one where,
uh,
you know,
like last year I spent a month in Asia,

1955
01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:37.600
there's great tours all over Asia right now.
Uh,

1956
01:50:37.601 --> 01:50:41.440
and then we spent a month in Australia,
four months in Europe.
Uh,

1957
01:50:41.441 --> 01:50:42.370
and then we'll take a little trip,

1958
01:50:42.371 --> 01:50:44.950
like we had a couple of weeks off when we were in Asia.

1959
01:50:44.980 --> 01:50:47.610
We went to Bali and just

1960
01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.570
<v 0>give you a hard time.
Like,
can we just get an apartment,
kill me,</v>

1961
01:50:50.690 --> 01:50:51.800
I want a place to put my shoes.

1962
01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:54.420
<v 8>No,
that was always hit.
I was like,
you know,
you know,
going through these,</v>

1963
01:50:54.421 --> 01:50:57.690
you know,
relationships that didn't work out.
I was always like,
God,

1964
01:50:57.691 --> 01:51:01.050
why can't I find a woman that likes to travel and sleep late and laugh a lot?

1965
01:51:01.500 --> 01:51:05.880
And,
uh,
I found her.
That's awesome.
So it's so great.
And she's a photographer,

1966
01:51:05.881 --> 01:51:07.950
so you know,
she,
uh,

1967
01:51:07.980 --> 01:51:11.900
she's just looking for art everywhere and she's awesome.
She's fun.

1968
01:51:11.980 --> 01:51:15.660
<v 0>It really is all about finding human beings that you're compatible with.
You,</v>

1969
01:51:16.100 --> 01:51:19.280
you know,
you,
you,
you're better because of them.
They're better because of you.

1970
01:51:19.281 --> 01:51:20.380
You pump each other up.

1971
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:23.380
So many people get in that negative fucking relationship loop.

1972
01:51:23.620 --> 01:51:27.190
And it's so common with comedians.
It's almost like a cliche.
Right,
right,
right,

1973
01:51:27.191 --> 01:51:30.340
right.
Well,
to hear a guy like you who's living this crazy life of travel,

1974
01:51:30.341 --> 01:51:32.550
but yet you're very happy,
you know,
it's,
it's,

1975
01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:34.720
it's nice to hear that when you find someone that's a,

1976
01:51:34.970 --> 01:51:36.050
<v 8>yeah,
she's an amazing,</v>

1977
01:51:36.051 --> 01:51:40.220
she's an amazing human being and she loves comedy and she loves hanging out with

1978
01:51:40.221 --> 01:51:42.200
Comedians and yet she still hangs out with you.

1979
01:51:44.690 --> 01:51:48.650
I got a tiger lady,
uh,
which,
you know,

1980
01:51:48.770 --> 01:51:53.240
it's awesome.
And so it's never like,
oh,
give me the evening.
It's always,

1981
01:51:53.241 --> 01:51:57.770
she like,
she loves hanging out with a comedian.
She,
she,
she loves the,
you know,

1982
01:51:57.771 --> 01:52:01.340
the,
the jokes and the creativity and she's a great Laffer.

1983
01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:03.630
It's amazing when you look back at your life and all the people that you could

1984
01:52:03.631 --> 01:52:06.930
have wound up with.
Isn't it?
Like,
I'm so glad I waited.
Yeah.

1985
01:52:07.130 --> 01:52:09.710
I'm so glad I waited and they're probably glad that you waited

1986
01:52:09.730 --> 01:52:12.250
<v 0>too because he became a different person along the way.
You know,</v>

1987
01:52:12.251 --> 01:52:16.180
you evolved along the way.
I mean,
if you met this chick now when you were 20,

1988
01:52:16.181 --> 01:52:18.790
you might've fucked it up.
I always look about,

1989
01:52:19.150 --> 01:52:22.390
but if you look back at like some of the relationship that you were in and some

1990
01:52:22.391 --> 01:52:26.920
of the shit that you're tolerated,
like,
oh,
what,
you just,

1991
01:52:26.950 --> 01:52:30.040
you would roll the dice.
You meet someone,
they're pretty cute.

1992
01:52:30.041 --> 01:52:33.280
You have a conversation,
you get a phone number,
you make a day,

1993
01:52:33.281 --> 01:52:34.210
you try to be cool with each other.

1994
01:52:34.450 --> 01:52:37.980
You don't even know how crazy they are until you know you're three months in and

1995
01:52:37.990 --> 01:52:39.380
you've been fucking run out of condoms

1996
01:52:39.630 --> 01:52:44.240
<v 8>two months.
You know,
you don't even really know how crazy she is.
Right.</v>

1997
01:52:44.270 --> 01:52:48.910
It's always,
you are always the crazy girls that are the,
you know,
the,
the,

1998
01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:52.610
the uh,
you know,
psych clones in the sack.
Man.

1999
01:52:52.670 --> 01:52:56.960
I remember I was with this girl and she was nothing but a headache and just

2000
01:52:56.961 --> 01:53:01.250
wanting to argue about such minuscule shit all the time.

2001
01:53:01.640 --> 01:53:04.360
But she was a butthole liquor.
Oh Jesus.

2002
01:53:04.370 --> 01:53:09.290
And you will stay in a bad relationship two years longer than you should for a

2003
01:53:09.291 --> 01:53:11.450
girl who like tongue grayness.

2004
01:53:11.820 --> 01:53:16.380
She like picky about when to do it or was she like right after the ball?
No,
no,

2005
01:53:16.381 --> 01:53:19.760
no,
no,
no shower.
No,
no.
It was always,
it was a,

2006
01:53:19.761 --> 01:53:22.790
it was a timely surprised that she knew how to deal out.

2007
01:53:22.900 --> 01:53:27.530
<v 0>It's a timely surprise.
Did you,
did you like shave your ass for a no.</v>

2008
01:53:27.531 --> 01:53:29.550
If you knew she was,
you let it go.
Handling.
Wow.

2009
01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:32.490
How clean does it ever really goes?

2010
01:53:32.520 --> 01:53:35.150
I mean how much are you washing down there that you're allowing that girl look

2011
01:53:35.151 --> 01:53:37.070
your ass like that.
Why?
I was,

2012
01:53:37.071 --> 01:53:41.240
I was scrubbing pretty ruthlessly when I wouldn't be trusting my hair's down

2013
01:53:41.241 --> 01:53:43.490
there.
That's like,
that's like saying here,

2014
01:53:43.491 --> 01:53:48.491
wash your face with this washcloth that I've been shitting into in the past 30

2015
01:53:49.191 --> 01:53:52.730
years,
but I cleaned it really good.
Those hairs,

2016
01:53:52.880 --> 01:53:56.840
who knows how long those hairs or cling to your asshole.
That's terrible,
man.

2017
01:53:56.841 --> 01:54:01.841
That's a really romantic story and turned it into a little dingleberry festival

2018
01:54:02.700 --> 01:54:05.840
is funny how you look back on,
especially when I get really high,

2019
01:54:05.841 --> 01:54:08.300
that's when it really jolts me.

2020
01:54:08.330 --> 01:54:11.240
When I really start thinking about like girls that I dated like 20 years ago or

2021
01:54:11.241 --> 01:54:14.210
whatever,
you really start thinking like how,
how insane,

2022
01:54:14.211 --> 01:54:18.570
like those look really young,
early relationships where how ridiculous they were.

2023
01:54:18.980 --> 01:54:21.500
You know what?
What a strange thing it is.

2024
01:54:21.860 --> 01:54:25.490
Especially back then when you would or you would run into people,

2025
01:54:25.670 --> 01:54:29.290
you would try to figure them out,
is this going to work?
Can we can do it up?
Nope.

2026
01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:32.150
Gotta go rotten and then get away from it.

2027
01:54:32.151 --> 01:54:36.320
Then there was no fucking text messaging.
There was no email.

2028
01:54:36.450 --> 01:54:38.120
It was like that was it.
You take care.

2029
01:54:38.510 --> 01:54:42.860
<v 8>Gone.
I know in Skype is the greatest invention in the world now.</v>

2030
01:54:42.870 --> 01:54:47.300
It's like,
you know,
traveling and you remember how like expensive it used to be,

2031
01:54:47.301 --> 01:54:51.860
like make a phone call and a hotel from the hotel room to call your mom or your

2032
01:54:51.861 --> 01:54:55.370
girlfriend.
Right.
Especially in natural,
you know,
God,
it's,

2033
01:54:55.371 --> 01:54:59.330
you can talk for hours,
for free on Skype and look at each other.

2034
01:54:59.410 --> 01:55:01.510
<v 0>Well,
it's weird,
right?
Incredible.
What a weird world.</v>

2035
01:55:01.511 --> 01:55:04.570
We live in a wonderful world.
It's just the beginning,
just the beginning.

2036
01:55:04.571 --> 01:55:07.840
But in these Google glasses go live,
have you seen these fucking things,

2037
01:55:08.070 --> 01:55:11.020
people walking around with glasses,
that information in front of him,

2038
01:55:11.021 --> 01:55:11.820
like the Terminator?

2039
01:55:11.820 --> 01:55:12.241
<v 8>Yeah.
You know,</v>

2040
01:55:12.241 --> 01:55:15.150
I've had everything in storage for six years here in Los Angeles because that

2041
01:55:15.151 --> 01:55:19.130
was the last place that I lived.
Uh,
and what do you have in store?
Well,

2042
01:55:19.140 --> 01:55:22.200
that's what I was gonna say is I can't wait to get everything out of storage to

2043
01:55:22.201 --> 01:55:25.650
see what electronics I've been hanging onto,
to do,
you know,

2044
01:55:25.651 --> 01:55:29.030
like the technological leap that we've made in the last six years.
Like,

2045
01:55:29.250 --> 01:55:33.180
I think I've got like a,
a,
a Sony Walkman.
I think I've,

2046
01:55:33.181 --> 01:55:35.370
I think I've got like an answering machine who hoo,

2047
01:55:35.480 --> 01:55:37.500
fuck it has an answering machine anymore.

2048
01:55:38.010 --> 01:55:40.530
I love going through my old answering machine tapes.

2049
01:55:40.531 --> 01:55:44.070
I don't know if you've saved a bunch.
Uh,
cause I had

2050
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:47.850
<v 4>one though where you could do the,
the cassette thing and uh,
I would,</v>

2051
01:55:47.851 --> 01:55:51.090
I would take it out and change it all.
I think I've got like 10 or 20 go through.

2052
01:55:51.091 --> 01:55:54.390
I just recently went through some on mine.
It was all amazing.
Listen,

2053
01:55:54.920 --> 01:55:58.440
a couple of people were dead in it,
you know,
my grandmother and like and stuff.

2054
01:55:58.441 --> 01:56:00.660
I'm like,
wow,
this is crazy.
I didn't even know I had this.

2055
01:56:01.140 --> 01:56:02.320
<v 0>Oh yeah.</v>

2056
01:56:03.250 --> 01:56:06.520
I used to have a buddy of mine had died of a voicemail message from him and I

2057
01:56:06.521 --> 01:56:08.230
listened to over and over and over again.

2058
01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:13.570
It's a weird thing that you could record someone's voice when they're dead long

2059
01:56:13.571 --> 01:56:16.510
gone.
They can have an impact on you like music.
So listen.

2060
01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:19.740
<v 4>Yeah.
Like my,
my father died and I wish I would is,
I,
you know,</v>

2061
01:56:19.750 --> 01:56:23.190
I wish I had saved all of his voice messages and,
uh,

2062
01:56:23.220 --> 01:56:25.980
my sister died last year,
uh,

2063
01:56:26.010 --> 01:56:30.960
breast cancer and I did a podcast interview with her,
uh,

2064
01:56:30.990 --> 01:56:35.190
like six months before she died.
And I'm so glad that I recorded it.

2065
01:56:35.490 --> 01:56:39.570
Um,
because it's great to hear her laugh and the way that she,

2066
01:56:40.110 --> 01:56:44.850
the way she expressed herself and her humor and her vibrancy and,
um,

2067
01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:48.300
it's like,
I think we should do that with,
do that with everybody you love.

2068
01:56:48.750 --> 01:56:52.200
You got the technology and um,
it's,

2069
01:56:52.350 --> 01:56:55.830
I'm so glad that I have her voice recorded on this conversation.

2070
01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:57.970
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

2071
01:56:58.010 --> 01:57:00.950
It's a weird thing to think that someone could just not be there anymore.

2072
01:57:01.010 --> 01:57:01.371
You know,

2073
01:57:01.371 --> 01:57:04.580
someone that you love so much and you maybe feel like you didn't get a chance to

2074
01:57:04.581 --> 01:57:07.510
say that to them.
Yeah.
You got to say that to people all the time.

2075
01:57:07.880 --> 01:57:09.470
People just appreciated people more.

2076
01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:13.420
There's these things that people used to take called ordeal poisons and uh,
they,

2077
01:57:13.421 --> 01:57:16.850
they would take him in indigenous areas that didn't really have access to

2078
01:57:16.851 --> 01:57:19.460
psychedelics and their ritual,

2079
01:57:19.461 --> 01:57:23.030
they're coming of age ritual would involve these ordeal poisons.
And you know,

2080
01:57:23.031 --> 01:57:26.080
they're,
they're shamonic rituals.
We have all this stuff.
And what it does is,

2081
01:57:26.081 --> 01:57:30.020
is like some chemical that almost fucking kills you,
almost kills you,

2082
01:57:30.060 --> 01:57:33.470
just fucks you sideways for a couple of days.
And then when it's over,

2083
01:57:33.471 --> 01:57:36.590
you feel so grateful that you're healthy again,
that you've like,

2084
01:57:36.591 --> 01:57:37.424
you changed your life.

2085
01:57:37.670 --> 01:57:40.040
<v 4>Well,
there's nothing like almost dying to make you appreciate living.</v>

2086
01:57:40.041 --> 01:57:43.940
I almost drowned in Thailand once scuba diving and really and yeah,

2087
01:57:43.941 --> 01:57:47.390
and then for like it was bad equipment.
And two is this,

2088
01:57:48.770 --> 01:57:51.230
is this French,
a resort in this,

2089
01:57:51.231 --> 01:57:54.380
a tattooed criminal scumbag,

2090
01:57:54.620 --> 01:57:58.010
a diving instructor from Mo Pta Phillipe.

2091
01:57:58.670 --> 01:58:01.820
And there was a reason why he was hanging out in the pee islands in Thailand.

2092
01:58:01.821 --> 01:58:04.460
You could just smell the cocaine criminal past on this guy.

2093
01:58:05.020 --> 01:58:09.620
And he was the diving instructor.
And then there was a,
a French girl,

2094
01:58:09.950 --> 01:58:10.970
Helene.

2095
01:58:11.120 --> 01:58:16.120
She worked at a Bordeaux International Airport for Air France at the ticket

2096
01:58:16.761 --> 01:58:20.720
counter,
and she was my diving partner and Oh my God,
this is going to be perfect.

2097
01:58:20.721 --> 01:58:25.220
I was single at the time.
This is going to be love Helene.
And uh,

2098
01:58:25.430 --> 01:58:30.290
Felipe also had a crush on this girl.
So every day,
oh,
so the,
there's the,
the,

2099
01:58:30.310 --> 01:58:31.143
the,

2100
01:58:31.370 --> 01:58:35.750
anyone who's ever been diving has to study a book for a week before they get in

2101
01:58:35.751 --> 01:58:39.560
the water.
I didn't,
the morning of my first dive,

2102
01:58:39.561 --> 01:58:43.950
I sat with a very hung over and he went over the hand signals with me.
Uh,

2103
01:58:43.980 --> 01:58:45.750
this means I cannot burry the,

2104
01:58:46.390 --> 01:58:51.220
this means I have a love of Ar,
a love of air.

2105
01:58:51.221 --> 01:58:56.140
Okay,
I'm under water.
Oxygen is precious.
No,
this means you are low of air.

2106
01:58:56.830 --> 01:58:59.110
Let's get it right.
Frenchie and so anyway,

2107
01:58:59.111 --> 01:59:02.470
every morning or every day has underwater flirting was outrageous.

2108
01:59:02.471 --> 01:59:06.250
He pushed me aside and be showing this girl around and I'm in the background.

2109
01:59:06.251 --> 01:59:08.380
And who's a girl you were with?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

2110
01:59:08.381 --> 01:59:10.900
But she was my diving buddy.
Oh,
okay.

2111
01:59:11.170 --> 01:59:15.700
It just worked out that he knew and he just fucking,
you know,
pushed me aside.

2112
01:59:15.701 --> 01:59:18.910
And,
uh,
you know,
cause you're grouped up and,
yeah.
And then,

2113
01:59:18.911 --> 01:59:23.890
so he's saying shit to me throughout the week.
Uh,

2114
01:59:23.920 --> 01:59:26.940
he just keeps fucking with me.
Uh,
please.
Uh,

2115
01:59:27.100 --> 01:59:30.820
we'd all like talked about what we did.
It was a French and English couple,

2116
01:59:30.830 --> 01:59:34.420
mark and Mara,
and they were,
they had lived in Paris for five years,

2117
01:59:34.421 --> 01:59:37.880
so they spoke fluent French.
And so we all talked and he was like a,

2118
01:59:37.881 --> 01:59:42.400
a stock trader.
And I told him that I was working for this Dutch travel TV show.

2119
01:59:42.700 --> 01:59:47.640
And so he keeps calling me Mister Television,
please,
Mr Television.

2120
01:59:48.080 --> 01:59:52.030
Uh,
you,
your buoyancy please.
Like anybody who's been diving,
you know,

2121
01:59:52.031 --> 01:59:53.340
you just touched those buttons.

2122
01:59:53.650 --> 01:59:55.600
Professional divers never used their hands and they're,

2123
01:59:55.601 --> 01:59:59.020
they got perfect parallel.
And,
uh,

2124
01:59:59.370 --> 02:00:04.020
everything Mr Television,
you,
he's just yelling at me and,
and,

2125
02:00:04.180 --> 02:00:08.890
and the morning that I almost died,
he was really addicted me.
And I said,
look,

2126
02:00:08.891 --> 02:00:11.680
Phillipe,
I gotta tell Ya,
you're making me feel uncomfortable.
You know,

2127
02:00:11.681 --> 02:00:15.940
I gotta trust you down there.
And he goes,
Ms. Dot.
American.

2128
02:00:16.120 --> 02:00:17.590
Have I hurt your feelings?

2129
02:00:18.140 --> 02:00:23.140
Maybe Zay Al-qaida has asked me to leave your body and say ocean today and then

2130
02:00:23.591 --> 02:00:27.710
this English guy mark,
it's all EEG.
You are out of old us.
Uh,

2131
02:00:28.270 --> 02:00:31.900
it was as him or do you?
To the French guy and it was just,
you know,
almost,

2132
02:00:32.200 --> 02:00:36.430
you know,
it was just really on the other guy was a,
he was,
he was defending me,

2133
02:00:36.710 --> 02:00:39.250
but he was a resident as well.
I mean he was,
he was in the diving class.

2134
02:00:39.251 --> 02:00:40.450
There's four people in the class,

2135
02:00:40.451 --> 02:00:43.030
this English couple and me in this French chick,
Helene.

2136
02:00:43.450 --> 02:00:46.570
And so we're paired up into,
you went in the water anyway,
even after all,
well,

2137
02:00:46.571 --> 02:00:50.410
yeah.
And then it was like this a,
I'm getting water in my,

2138
02:00:50.780 --> 02:00:55.120
in my breathing.
You think you fucked with you?
I don't know.
I might've though.

2139
02:00:55.121 --> 02:00:56.740
Right?
I mean it just seems think so.

2140
02:00:56.741 --> 02:00:59.770
They said there was something wrong with the tank and in retrospect it was

2141
02:01:00.040 --> 02:01:03.610
Russian roulette and I got the bad tank.
And so,
uh,

2142
02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:06.040
my spare tube is getting water.

2143
02:01:06.210 --> 02:01:08.200
I'm hitting the button and I'm still getting water.

2144
02:01:08.201 --> 02:01:12.430
In your lungs don't want water.
And um,
it was like,
it wasn't that deep.

2145
02:01:12.431 --> 02:01:15.730
It was only like 40 feet,
whatever.
But it was deep enough to be dangerous.

2146
02:01:15.731 --> 02:01:19.840
And I knew you couldn't shoot up to the top and he's way ahead of me and I swim

2147
02:01:19.841 --> 02:01:23.020
to this French fuck as quick as I could and who'd have thought I ever would have

2148
02:01:23.021 --> 02:01:25.570
got to use the,
I cannot breathe signal.

2149
02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:30.840
And he just seemed to really take his time getting me that extra respirator.

2150
02:01:32.261 --> 02:01:35.330
And by the time it hit my mouth,
I had held my breath for so long.
I did.

2151
02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:40.160
His death bark came out of me.
It was the sound of someone dying.
And it came

2152
02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:44.240
<v 8>out of me and I really thought this is the last moment of my life seeing all</v>

2153
02:01:44.241 --> 02:01:46.730
these bubbles and this French guy's face.

2154
02:01:46.970 --> 02:01:49.490
And he got me to the top obviously.

2155
02:01:49.580 --> 02:01:53.390
And then he asked to take,
uh,
when we got back,

2156
02:01:53.750 --> 02:01:57.020
he invited me to go into the little village and have a beer.

2157
02:01:57.860 --> 02:02:01.150
And uh,
I told him,
you know,
I,

2158
02:02:01.151 --> 02:02:05.360
I learned true buoyancy today cause it's all about true poignancy.
And diving,

2159
02:02:05.510 --> 02:02:06.920
you know,
uh,

2160
02:02:07.160 --> 02:02:10.040
I said this morning when you said that shit about al Qaeda wanted you dead,

2161
02:02:10.041 --> 02:02:13.800
I hated your guts,
but then you saved my life and no all's forgiven.

2162
02:02:15.140 --> 02:02:18.650
Wow.
I learned the true meaning of true buoyancy.
Oh.
So then like,
wait,

2163
02:02:18.651 --> 02:02:23.180
how did he respond to that?
And he was okay with it,
you know,
he was okay with it.

2164
02:02:23.270 --> 02:02:26.450
You know,
he wasn't like a,
a powerful moment between you guys.
I mean,

2165
02:02:26.460 --> 02:02:29.120
you saved your fucking life.
Yeah.
I mean he,

2166
02:02:29.121 --> 02:02:34.121
I think he was glad that I didn't die because it would've cost him his job and

2167
02:02:35.140 --> 02:02:37.520
he,
you know,
it was okay.
It was a nice moment.

2168
02:02:37.570 --> 02:02:40.190
Do you think he was a hardened dude?
You didn't feel like he's a hard guy?

2169
02:02:40.191 --> 02:02:43.520
He had been in jail.
He had been in prison in France.
There was a reason.
Really.

2170
02:02:43.521 --> 02:02:48.110
Yeah.
He had like these homemade gel,
jailhouse tattoos and uh,

2171
02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:49.910
you know,
he was just a,
you know,

2172
02:02:49.940 --> 02:02:53.700
tough guy and that doesn't just got back to the bruise a Douche bag.

2173
02:02:53.750 --> 02:02:54.561
He was a Douche bag.

2174
02:02:54.561 --> 02:02:59.270
I got back to the resort and by the water there was this little Tiki hut bar and

2175
02:02:59.570 --> 02:03:02.900
Helene was there and she spoke forwards of English.

2176
02:03:02.901 --> 02:03:06.670
I spoke forwards of French and I'm making small talk with her and I go,
um,

2177
02:03:07.050 --> 02:03:10.250
so what's the first thing you're gonna do when you get back to Bordeaux?

2178
02:03:10.700 --> 02:03:15.050
She goes,
make love to my boyfriend.
He was like,
Oh shit.

2179
02:03:16.460 --> 02:03:18.980
I didn't even have a chance with this girl.
I risked my life.

2180
02:03:19.460 --> 02:03:24.210
Jesus Christ is the second thing you're going to do.
There is no second thing.
He,

2181
02:03:24.240 --> 02:03:27.830
you,
I almost died for you.
Whore.
Wow.

2182
02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:33.530
We trying to impress her and away you went deep.
Yeah.
You don't,

2183
02:03:33.531 --> 02:03:36.650
when you're on vacation in your mind plays tricks on you.
You're like,
oh yeah,

2184
02:03:37.190 --> 02:03:41.420
so you were on vacation with this girl,
but there was no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,

2185
02:03:41.421 --> 02:03:41.660
no.

2186
02:03:41.660 --> 02:03:46.660
I was doing this Hong Kong Thailand tour and I was working for the Dutch travel

2187
02:03:46.851 --> 02:03:51.740
show and they told me if I got certified diving while I was in Thailand,

2188
02:03:52.040 --> 02:03:55.920
the next assignment they would send me to the Caribbean to for,

2189
02:03:55.990 --> 02:04:00.350
so uh,
I had two weeks off,
stayed on cope pp,

2190
02:04:00.351 --> 02:04:03.710
this wonderful little island way out in the Bay of Bang Gal,

2191
02:04:03.711 --> 02:04:07.040
you fly like an hour and a half from Bangkok to poop cat.

2192
02:04:07.041 --> 02:04:11.930
And then you take a boat in the for like four hours out into the Bay of Bengal

2193
02:04:11.931 --> 02:04:15.820
before you get to the PPI islands.
Wow.
And it's where like a,

2194
02:04:15.830 --> 02:04:20.720
around that area is where Leonardo Dicaprio did the beach.
Great movie.

2195
02:04:22.010 --> 02:04:23.350
I liked that man was a really,

2196
02:04:24.110 --> 02:04:28.630
what was it about a guy almost drowning in Thailand now?
They,

2197
02:04:28.710 --> 02:04:31.380
it was,
they were there in paradise.
They don't wanna leave.
Yeah.

2198
02:04:31.390 --> 02:04:32.700
They swam to this island.

2199
02:04:32.730 --> 02:04:36.350
They found like these people that lived on this island and it was like a secret

2200
02:04:36.351 --> 02:04:38.160
and then they,
you

2201
02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:39.750
<v 2>know,
it's just a,
it's a cool movie.</v>

2202
02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:43.350
I tend to always like Leonardo movies even though his gaze that sounds,

2203
02:04:43.351 --> 02:04:48.270
but like basketball diaries and ception like all these,
maybe the gas tank,

2204
02:04:48.570 --> 02:04:52.840
boom,
boom Gilbert.
Great.
What a great movie.
Yeah.
Did you see the uh,

2205
02:04:52.860 --> 02:04:57.770
j Edgar Hoover?
No,
I never saw that.
Interesting.
Not really that,
I mean it was,

2206
02:04:57.810 --> 02:05:01.380
it's a really fascinating study on a guy who just had an incredible amount of

2207
02:05:01.381 --> 02:05:04.590
power and kept it to the end,
just clung onto it.
And it's like,

2208
02:05:04.591 --> 02:05:08.690
it's an interesting to see the struggle and his weird problems,
you know,

2209
02:05:08.790 --> 02:05:12.250
accepting the fact that he was gay and really weird fucking guy,
man.

2210
02:05:12.251 --> 02:05:16.110
I'm the fact that that guy somehow or another rose to the position of like the

2211
02:05:16.111 --> 02:05:20.840
secret keeper in the world of politics.
Really fucking kind of creepy.
Yeah.

2212
02:05:20.841 --> 02:05:24.270
You know,
the system was so shitty that this creepy can,
could fucking,

2213
02:05:24.660 --> 02:05:27.450
he could be the one pulling everybody's strings.
Like,
what'd you do?

2214
02:05:27.451 --> 02:05:30.600
How'd this guy get there?
They never,

2215
02:05:30.630 --> 02:05:32.640
they never offered to me and they had secrets on everybody.

2216
02:05:33.420 --> 02:05:38.100
They never offered him,
you know,
and it became,
it must be madness at the end.

2217
02:05:38.400 --> 02:05:41.400
I must've been like,
this guy must have had shit stored all over the place.

2218
02:05:41.410 --> 02:05:44.460
But see,
everybody wins the case.
They killed him.

2219
02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:46.440
Casey was in a plane crash or some shit.

2220
02:05:46.530 --> 02:05:49.280
All these Manila envelopes gets sent out.
Yeah.

2221
02:05:49.290 --> 02:05:50.820
I mean that's probably the only way to stay alive.

2222
02:05:50.821 --> 02:05:54.530
If you got some secrets about people like that and some high order,
well,
pay me.

2223
02:05:54.540 --> 02:05:54.960
That's how,

2224
02:05:54.960 --> 02:05:59.730
that's how Putin rose to power because he was in the KGB for for years and

2225
02:05:59.731 --> 02:06:04.080
apparently that's what I heard about Putin.
Really?
He had shit on everybody.

2226
02:06:06.060 --> 02:06:09.270
He makes our fucking politicians look like such pussies.

2227
02:06:09.630 --> 02:06:14.460
He's always bare chested,
fly fishing with a fucking snowboard tucked into,

2228
02:06:15.690 --> 02:06:17.940
at least you see Obama without a shirt on.
You know,

2229
02:06:17.941 --> 02:06:21.900
a body surfing in Hawaii and stuff.
There's been shots of,
you know,

2230
02:06:22.530 --> 02:06:24.240
it's cool you live,
you know,
you look good guy.

2231
02:06:24.250 --> 02:06:25.890
Looks like he could still kick a little less.

2232
02:06:25.950 --> 02:06:28.770
I think Putin would fucking ever see Romney with his shirt off.

2233
02:06:29.130 --> 02:06:32.280
You don't think that Putin would fuck Obama and Romney Rodney up at the same,

2234
02:06:32.300 --> 02:06:34.740
oh my God.
Totally.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2235
02:06:34.950 --> 02:06:38.040
He would hip toss the first guy and after he hip dos Mitt Romney,

2236
02:06:38.041 --> 02:06:41.410
Obama would panic.
It wouldn't know again,
you know.
Yeah.
And he's a judo guy,

2237
02:06:41.411 --> 02:06:46.320
black belt.
Uh,
and,
and you know,
he learned some,
some,
some deadly shit in the KGB.

2238
02:06:46.321 --> 02:06:48.840
Know he's killed people with rocks.
You look at that guys face,

2239
02:06:48.841 --> 02:06:52.080
that guy has killed people with rocks.
He's probably killed people with forks.

2240
02:06:52.740 --> 02:06:55.260
You know what I mean?
He's,
he,
that's a motherfucker.

2241
02:06:55.710 --> 02:06:59.890
That's one of the craziest things about Russia is that that guy,

2242
02:06:59.891 --> 02:07:02.260
somehow another stays in power still in power.

2243
02:07:02.310 --> 02:07:05.640
They have this weird thing where he like,
he wasn't in office anymore,

2244
02:07:05.641 --> 02:07:08.590
but then he was like,
he had another position.
You became the prime minister.

2245
02:07:09.920 --> 02:07:13.920
It's kind of still running shit.
It's very strange.

2246
02:07:14.120 --> 02:07:15.660
Russia is a different world,
man.

2247
02:07:15.750 --> 02:07:19.860
How about Romney fucking up pissing off all of England?
What did he do?

2248
02:07:20.220 --> 02:07:22.950
You didn't see that,
but he went like right before the Olympics.

2249
02:07:22.951 --> 02:07:26.700
He said he had seen some disconcerting,
uh,
things that,

2250
02:07:26.730 --> 02:07:31.050
that he was worried whether or not the London Olympics would be a success and

2251
02:07:31.051 --> 02:07:35.010
pissed off.
David Cameron,
the Prime Minister of England,

2252
02:07:35.170 --> 02:07:36.640
he's in the Conservative Party,

2253
02:07:36.640 --> 02:07:38.530
<v 8>which you think that would be his ally.</v>

2254
02:07:38.531 --> 02:07:41.500
They're more like the Republicans are like the same kind of people.
Right.

2255
02:07:41.590 --> 02:07:46.120
And David Cameron pitch slapped him and he said,
uh,
uh,

2256
02:07:46.570 --> 02:07:50.980
you did.
London is one of the biggest,
largest bustling cities in the world.

2257
02:07:50.981 --> 02:07:54.640
He said,
it's easy to put on an Olympics in the middle of nowhere,

2258
02:07:54.730 --> 02:07:58.690
meaning Salt Lake City,
you Mitt Romney punk,

2259
02:07:59.200 --> 02:08:03.640
and just like bitch slapped him and in,
in,
in front on the world stage,

2260
02:08:05.470 --> 02:08:08.410
<v 0>I guess that's a bitch slap that's about the Olympics.
Who gives a fuck?</v>

2261
02:08:08.580 --> 02:08:11.410
Seems silly.
When I think is a fascinating,

2262
02:08:11.411 --> 02:08:13.240
really fascinating about this guy was the,

2263
02:08:13.241 --> 02:08:15.190
might not have paid taxes for 10 years,

2264
02:08:15.670 --> 02:08:19.330
<v 8>right?
And that,
uh,
this guy,
I loved it.</v>

2265
02:08:19.331 --> 02:08:24.100
The Democrats are playing that old Republican dirty game that was always the

2266
02:08:24.101 --> 02:08:26.750
Republicans did the dirty ads and shit.
And the Democrats that,

2267
02:08:26.751 --> 02:08:29.140
I love that ad where Romney singing America,

2268
02:08:29.141 --> 02:08:32.410
the beautiful off key and then they show he's got his money in The Bahamas,

2269
02:08:32.411 --> 02:08:33.410
in the Cayman Islands.

2270
02:08:33.411 --> 02:08:37.980
He cares so much about the United States that he keeps his money off foreign

2271
02:08:37.990 --> 02:08:38.560
shore.

2272
02:08:38.560 --> 02:08:42.070
<v 0>It becomes a problem though when you really accept the fact that the guy's a</v>

2273
02:08:42.071 --> 02:08:45.940
businessman.
I'm not saying that what he did wasn't unethical,

2274
02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:47.680
but if it was legal,

2275
02:08:47.720 --> 02:08:52.660
there are sort of obligated by their shareholders to do the things that profit

2276
02:08:52.661 --> 02:08:56.020
them the most as long as it's within the legal parameters and

2277
02:08:56.050 --> 02:08:58.990
<v 8>right.
But the personal taxes,
there was a eye on,</v>

2278
02:08:58.991 --> 02:09:03.700
on like a potis on serious that I heard as a Romney speech,

2279
02:09:03.701 --> 02:09:05.020
like six months there.
I don't know,

2280
02:09:05.021 --> 02:09:07.810
whenever his tax has just came out three months ago,
whatever that was.

2281
02:09:08.260 --> 02:09:11.650
And some guys stood up at his speech and said,
uh,
on your personal taxes,

2282
02:09:11.651 --> 02:09:16.651
it says you've got one point $6 million invested in foreign countries outside of

2283
02:09:17.561 --> 02:09:18.101
the United States.

2284
02:09:18.101 --> 02:09:21.700
Why isn't that money being invested in the United States if you care so much

2285
02:09:21.701 --> 02:09:24.640
about it?
And he goes,
oh,
well,
how was unaware of that?

2286
02:09:24.641 --> 02:09:26.470
I'll have to look into that.
You know,

2287
02:09:26.471 --> 02:09:30.430
if you're unaware of 1000001.6 million fucking dollars,

2288
02:09:30.550 --> 02:09:32.590
that shit's ridiculous.
Yeah.
You know,

2289
02:09:32.591 --> 02:09:36.610
Romney's desperate because his new campaign slogan is Mitt Romney.

2290
02:09:36.820 --> 02:09:37.840
He's not the black guy.

2291
02:09:39.170 --> 02:09:42.620
<v 0>Oh,
how dare you work in material into show up.
Dare you sir.</v>

2292
02:09:43.370 --> 02:09:46.760
How dare you?
I think it's ridiculous.
I think it's,

2293
02:09:46.761 --> 02:09:49.160
this is the biggest shell game ever.
We're,
we're still playing it.

2294
02:09:49.190 --> 02:09:52.670
We're still soccer's pretending there's a real election going on.

2295
02:09:52.790 --> 02:09:55.500
Same fucking companies are paying his campaign and this,

2296
02:09:56.690 --> 02:10:00.460
there's a lot of cross campaigning and they,
you know,
it's a bribery.
We,

2297
02:10:00.461 --> 02:10:01.630
we've passed laws.

2298
02:10:01.640 --> 02:10:05.480
The Supreme Court is completely failed us and they pass laws that allow these

2299
02:10:05.481 --> 02:10:07.490
corporations to donate as much money as they liked.

2300
02:10:07.491 --> 02:10:11.630
They act as an individual and they can make massive donations and that affects

2301
02:10:11.631 --> 02:10:12.280
law.
And that's

2302
02:10:12.280 --> 02:10:13.870
<v 8>who was,
I think it was at wilderness.</v>

2303
02:10:13.900 --> 02:10:17.680
Some comedian a few years ago said that politicians should be like race car

2304
02:10:17.681 --> 02:10:21.610
drivers.
They should wear the,
um,
their corporate sponsors ours.

2305
02:10:21.820 --> 02:10:25.000
<v 0>Yeah.
That is hilarious.
I think that was durast might've been it sounds like him.</v>

2306
02:10:25.900 --> 02:10:28.780
Yeah,
it's genius.
It is.
It's true.
It's nonsense.

2307
02:10:28.990 --> 02:10:31.870
I mean when you feel like doctor drew got paid,
you know,

2308
02:10:31.900 --> 02:10:34.100
over 100,000 for a,

2309
02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:37.280
I think it was more than that 200 and something thousand dollars to promote

2310
02:10:37.310 --> 02:10:42.310
certain certain antidepressants to promote their off shelf properties.

2311
02:10:42.830 --> 02:10:46.910
Like a fact that they make you horny or something and they're better for for
sex.

2312
02:10:47.060 --> 02:10:50.060
Like he hear that and you'll come on.
Really can't trust anybody.

2313
02:10:50.090 --> 02:10:52.040
You can't trust anybody.
Is everybody getting paid off?

2314
02:10:52.140 --> 02:10:54.990
Everybody getting paid off as I hock Alpha brain at the beginning of my

2315
02:10:57.590 --> 02:10:58.980
<v 8>swear to God,
I wouldn't have it if I didn't.</v>

2316
02:11:01.040 --> 02:11:03.870
I just got a competent comment on there.
Anybody who's not for sale,

2317
02:11:03.871 --> 02:11:04.770
I own hypocrisy.

2318
02:11:06.170 --> 02:11:06.340
<v 5>Okay.</v>

2319
02:11:06.340 --> 02:11:08.560
<v 0>I'll try to keep it as real as possible.
Ladies and gentlemen.</v>

2320
02:11:08.710 --> 02:11:13.660
It's very difficult,
but that is real brain Israel.
No,

2321
02:11:13.661 --> 02:11:16.000
no one diet for you.
No exercise.
No one.

2322
02:11:16.140 --> 02:11:20.170
<v 8>I told you I just started doing the yoga.
I do vitamin</v>

2323
02:11:20.210 --> 02:11:24.160
<v 0>C,
multivitamins and shit.
Fish oils,
the shit.
A lot of fish oil.</v>

2324
02:11:24.790 --> 02:11:28.660
It's amazing.
Make u joints feel better.
I take fish oil and a multivitamin.

2325
02:11:29.590 --> 02:11:34.590
Do you a count down the days till the singularity when you can download your

2326
02:11:34.661 --> 02:11:38.140
cell phone,
your computer,
are you thinking about that for the future?
What's that?

2327
02:11:38.410 --> 02:11:40.710
The singularity.
You don't know whether,
um,

2328
02:11:40.810 --> 02:11:42.940
you ever hear live race Kurt's while any of that shit,

2329
02:11:43.330 --> 02:11:47.320
futurists that believe that artificial technology or artificial intelligence

2330
02:11:47.321 --> 02:11:50.620
rather it's going to be,
uh,
the,
the,
the next stage of existence.

2331
02:11:50.621 --> 02:11:54.950
We're gonna be able to download ourself into machines.
Nothing.
That's actually,

2332
02:11:54.980 --> 02:11:56.260
I figured that to me to be right up your alley.

2333
02:11:56.320 --> 02:11:58.300
<v 8>Somebody mentioned that to me the other day that this is,</v>

2334
02:11:58.301 --> 02:12:02.560
we're living already in it.
This,
this virtual world that there is some uh,

2335
02:12:02.561 --> 02:12:03.910
economist came up with some,

2336
02:12:03.940 --> 02:12:07.840
some like secret computer code in the forties.

2337
02:12:08.590 --> 02:12:13.380
Then we're already living in this.
Uh,
and I was like,
simulation send me,

2338
02:12:13.381 --> 02:12:13.680
it's called

2339
02:12:13.680 --> 02:12:16.680
<v 0>simulation theory.
It's been all been talking about with my friends.</v>

2340
02:12:17.010 --> 02:12:19.320
Me and Duncan get on the phone almost every other day and talking about

2341
02:12:19.321 --> 02:12:22.530
simulation theory.
And so the thing is there's Duncan Trussell.
Yeah,

2342
02:12:22.630 --> 02:12:25.980
<v 8>that's who told me this.
Oh,
there you go.
Perfect.
That's who is that?</v>

2343
02:12:26.050 --> 02:12:30.560
That's who I was talking to.
It was Duncan who's also perfect.

2344
02:12:30.590 --> 02:12:34.630
I was like,
Shit,
I can't afford property and this,
this,
this world.
Either.

2345
02:12:34.780 --> 02:12:39.130
<v 0>He and I discussed this all the time and it's uh,
it's what it is,</v>

2346
02:12:39.131 --> 02:12:43.300
is particle physicists,
I believe it was or whoever the fuck it was.

2347
02:12:43.301 --> 02:12:46.540
He's the string string theory theory.
Uh,
guys,

2348
02:12:46.570 --> 02:12:51.570
they found some sort of very specific code and a in the nature of reality,

2349
02:12:51.611 --> 02:12:51.821
you know,

2350
02:12:51.821 --> 02:12:55.110
like there's the Fibonacci sequence and this that's like what faces are designed

2351
02:12:55.111 --> 02:12:57.250
certain ways and sunflowers are designed set more.

2352
02:12:57.520 --> 02:13:00.460
There's called the golden ratio,
I believe it's called.
Or is that pie?

2353
02:13:00.850 --> 02:13:01.390
Whatever it is.

2354
02:13:01.390 --> 02:13:05.450
The FIBONACCI sequence is a number sequence that exists in everything and exist

2355
02:13:05.460 --> 02:13:09.880
in pine cones,
sunflower seeds,
the way the petals of a flower Barat blossom,

2356
02:13:09.881 --> 02:13:14.140
the way the branches of a tree.
It's all to a,
a very specific mathematical code.

2357
02:13:14.380 --> 02:13:15.213
It's amazing.

2358
02:13:15.250 --> 02:13:17.890
It's amazing when you really stop and look at the fact that while this might

2359
02:13:17.891 --> 02:13:21.030
really be some crazy one in zero program,
you know,

2360
02:13:21.370 --> 02:13:24.820
but Dunkin is obsessed with it.
And as am I,
we talk about it every,
it sounds,

2361
02:13:24.850 --> 02:13:27.910
I mean people get pissed and we talk about it so much on the podcast because it

2362
02:13:27.911 --> 02:13:32.790
becomes like almost a repetitive topic but it's still fascinating still to me.

2363
02:13:33.030 --> 02:13:36.300
I can talk about a hundred days in a row and it's still fucking tweaks my head

2364
02:13:36.810 --> 02:13:40.770
because it's going to be real someday.
Someday.
If look,

2365
02:13:40.771 --> 02:13:44.550
if you believe that TVS didn't use to exist at one point in time and someone

2366
02:13:44.551 --> 02:13:45.384
invented it,

2367
02:13:45.500 --> 02:13:50.500
that that that mind blowing change is just one step and an infinite process of

2368
02:13:51.211 --> 02:13:55.710
constant technological reinvention,
innovation,

2369
02:13:55.890 --> 02:14:00.360
new shit constantly coming down in an ever escalating pace.

2370
02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:05.850
If one day we can envision or virtual reality,
we easily could be in an already,

2371
02:14:06.540 --> 02:14:09.930
why would you mean you're not going to know if that would suck.
If you,

2372
02:14:09.931 --> 02:14:13.230
if you wanted to live this fake life and you know you would have like,
like,

2373
02:14:13.260 --> 02:14:15.870
like tabs to quit x here,

2374
02:14:15.930 --> 02:14:18.420
you know like little floating tabs in your life where you could put,

2375
02:14:18.660 --> 02:14:21.150
you would never think about the life being real anymore.

2376
02:14:21.300 --> 02:14:24.510
You wouldn't even really like it or appreciate it.
You can't have the tabs.

2377
02:14:24.511 --> 02:14:26.520
You can't have a way out.
It's all in.

2378
02:14:28.350 --> 02:14:32.340
It's all in the simulation or not.
We're not.
You know,
it was just horse shit.

2379
02:14:32.580 --> 02:14:35.220
Maybe it's just hippie nonsense while you wait for the end.

2380
02:14:35.940 --> 02:14:38.220
She brought that kid that got shot in the back seat of a car.

2381
02:14:38.221 --> 02:14:42.210
The cops was handcuffed him and shot him in the head.
They said he shot himself.

2382
02:14:42.300 --> 02:14:46.650
Yeah.
Yeah,
and I'm no though.

2383
02:14:46.651 --> 02:14:50.580
This is a new one.
The Anaheim,
they've got fucking military in a,

2384
02:14:50.581 --> 02:14:53.460
in the street arresting people,
shooting rubber bullets at people,

2385
02:14:53.461 --> 02:14:57.900
arresting people.
It's crazy.
They're wearing camouflage.
It's real bizarre.

2386
02:14:58.230 --> 02:15:00.630
It seems very strange when you see them.
It's a,

2387
02:15:00.660 --> 02:15:04.020
there's a whole different thing when you see them wearing like this Iraq desert

2388
02:15:04.260 --> 02:15:06.450
military camouflage.
Like why is,

2389
02:15:06.780 --> 02:15:09.810
why are you wearing desert camouflage in Anaheim?

2390
02:15:10.050 --> 02:15:12.520
And what the fuck is this place in the world?
That's why,

2391
02:15:12.590 --> 02:15:14.550
but it's almost like you're wearing your gang colors.

2392
02:15:14.580 --> 02:15:18.180
Like you're letting everybody know,
like this is the military,
you know,
this is a,

2393
02:15:18.181 --> 02:15:21.390
this is the,
this is our gang color.
We were like sand camouflage.

2394
02:15:21.920 --> 02:15:24.620
<v 4>Well,
I,
yeah,
I think it's the future.
When I lived in Amsterdam,</v>

2395
02:15:25.460 --> 02:15:29.560
I guess 2002 when the second Iraq war,
uh,
was,
was,

2396
02:15:29.570 --> 02:15:33.440
was just about the start.
There was this massive,
uh,

2397
02:15:33.460 --> 02:15:36.710
anti war protests on museum plane,
uh,

2398
02:15:36.711 --> 02:15:41.090
this big piece of green grass by the museums,
museums square.

2399
02:15:41.510 --> 02:15:43.700
Um,
and all of these people,

2400
02:15:43.701 --> 02:15:48.701
like thousands of people were out there and from every direction at one point,

2401
02:15:48.921 --> 02:15:53.260
like it was,
some people started throwing bottles.
There was a few,
uh,
you know,

2402
02:15:53.270 --> 02:15:58.130
knucklehead hooligans who were throwing bottles and then all of the sudden from

2403
02:15:58.131 --> 02:16:02.330
every direction of this massive square about the size of a football field.

2404
02:16:02.570 --> 02:16:07.520
So you've got like six different streets coming into this rectangular big grass

2405
02:16:07.521 --> 02:16:11.600
area and from all six directions.
These,

2406
02:16:11.601 --> 02:16:14.990
I have never seen vehicles like this in my life.
These like,
uh,

2407
02:16:15.020 --> 02:16:19.760
like these millet to these grey military vehicles came busting in and

2408
02:16:19.761 --> 02:16:23.570
everybody's just running like ranks,
like tank look and things.

2409
02:16:23.571 --> 02:16:28.571
And they had water cannons on the top and these water cannons were like,

2410
02:16:28.611 --> 02:16:29.444
just

2411
02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:34.910
<v 8>spray and pee on shooting him,
knocking people down like,
you know,
Alabama,
uh,</v>

2412
02:16:34.930 --> 02:16:39.640
in the 60s,
Birmingham,
uh,
you know,
uh,
the fire hoses on people.

2413
02:16:39.910 --> 02:16:41.500
And I was like,
wow,

2414
02:16:41.800 --> 02:16:45.940
that's the future where they can just come in with these military vehicles and

2415
02:16:45.941 --> 02:16:47.890
just spray people.
They don't even have to kill them.
Just,

2416
02:16:47.891 --> 02:16:52.090
you know what the fuck though.
Really?
Yeah.
In Amsterdam.

2417
02:16:52.710 --> 02:16:55.890
<v 0>That's crazy.
So Amazon's another ass fucking place.</v>

2418
02:16:55.891 --> 02:16:58.940
They have the best kickboxers uh,
pretty much ever like it.

2419
02:16:59.340 --> 02:17:02.260
Even better than the Thai guys cause they're bigger people,
you know,

2420
02:17:02.270 --> 02:17:03.180
I mean if you want it to com,

2421
02:17:03.630 --> 02:17:06.690
compare it like the ties certainly of the more skilled practitioners,

2422
02:17:06.691 --> 02:17:08.130
but they're really lighter guys.

2423
02:17:08.430 --> 02:17:12.360
But they've had guys that have done really well in a gun over there from

2424
02:17:12.361 --> 02:17:16.710
Amsterdam,
even the lighter weights and compete and beaten the,
the ties.
But uh,

2425
02:17:16.860 --> 02:17:20.370
Amsterdam is super famous for a kickbox Holland in general,

2426
02:17:20.371 --> 02:17:21.900
super famous for kickboxing.

2427
02:17:22.290 --> 02:17:26.010
What's the one area developed like some of the best kick boxers of all time.

2428
02:17:26.280 --> 02:17:29.760
All the like big,
top name heavyweights.
A huge amount of them came from Holland.

2429
02:17:30.090 --> 02:17:32.970
Nice Remy bone chasky or Nesto who's,

2430
02:17:33.030 --> 02:17:37.720
<v 8>it's also one of the world's largest banking entities.
Is it really?
That's the,</v>

2431
02:17:37.730 --> 02:17:40.110
the ultimate trick that the Dutch do is they,

2432
02:17:40.800 --> 02:17:44.070
they want people to think it's all marijuana and tulips over there and

2433
02:17:44.071 --> 02:17:48.300
prostitutes.
But you know,
like the rolling stones and u two,

2434
02:17:48.301 --> 02:17:51.300
I think Coca Cola,
all these corporations are based there.

2435
02:17:51.301 --> 02:17:56.240
The Elvis Presley estate,
so they can get these uh,
um,
you know,

2436
02:17:56.490 --> 02:17:59.250
<v 0>tax rates and stuff.
What kind of low tax rates are we talking about?</v>

2437
02:17:59.720 --> 02:18:04.180
Like Mitt Romney,
low time to move on.
Maybe we met Tom to move to Amsterdam.
Damn.

2438
02:18:04.190 --> 02:18:09.090
Student gets cold there.
Dude gets cold there.
But on global warming kicks in,

2439
02:18:09.091 --> 02:18:13.260
I might be the spot.
Yeah,
right on the ocean start to rise.
Right.

2440
02:18:13.320 --> 02:18:14.680
<v 8>Well,
and that's the thing,
it's underwater.</v>

2441
02:18:14.700 --> 02:18:18.390
It's the low lands and that's why they have canal.
So if the,
if the oceans rise,

2442
02:18:18.420 --> 02:18:19.830
Holland will be non existent.

2443
02:18:19.920 --> 02:18:24.090
<v 0>Have you seen the satellite images of Greenland,
Greenland for the first time.</v>

2444
02:18:24.091 --> 02:18:27.660
I was no snow on it.
Wow.
Look at this.
So you pull that shit up Brian.

2445
02:18:28.530 --> 02:18:31.780
It's ridiculous.
They,
uh,
they,

2446
02:18:31.810 --> 02:18:36.060
they haven't had this happen since like the 18 hundreds,
I don't think Greenland.

2447
02:18:36.320 --> 02:18:38.210
And they're saying this is like one of the best,
uh,

2448
02:18:38.310 --> 02:18:42.990
signs that there really is some sort of global warming catastrophe that's about

2449
02:18:42.991 --> 02:18:46.810
to happen.
Well,
that already happened in a couple of hundred years ago.

2450
02:18:46.811 --> 02:18:49.560
When I just mean it's like,
oh,
it's just happened again.
Well,

2451
02:18:49.980 --> 02:18:53.880
the idea is it is going to happen again,
but we're going to have to figure out,

2452
02:18:54.030 --> 02:18:58.920
um,
how to,
uh,
how to move around it.
Like,
look,
did you see the pictures?

2453
02:18:59.010 --> 02:19:02.010
I'm looking at pulling out.
I got it right here.
So you go to Google image.

2454
02:19:02.011 --> 02:19:06.390
The first image shows you the extent of the surface mount.

2455
02:19:06.391 --> 02:19:10.170
It's pretty fucking crazy because Greenland is pretty much all covered in ice.

2456
02:19:10.710 --> 02:19:14.660
Did you see the first one?
If you go to Google a image,
just,
uh,
Google,
uh,

2457
02:19:14.700 --> 02:19:15.900
Greenland melted,

2458
02:19:17.400 --> 02:19:21.390
just Greenland melted and they're the first one.
The first one.
Now look at that.

2459
02:19:21.900 --> 02:19:23.790
That's what it used to look like on the left.

2460
02:19:24.220 --> 02:19:28.190
That's what it looks like now on the right,
there's no smile.
That's crazy.

2461
02:19:28.850 --> 02:19:31.970
<v 2>I mean that's,
it's really hard to wrap your fucking head around man.</v>

2462
02:19:32.680 --> 02:19:33.513
<v 5>Hmm.</v>

2463
02:19:33.920 --> 02:19:36.350
<v 2>And uh,
I don't think that happens very often.</v>

2464
02:19:37.730 --> 02:19:40.070
I think the idea is that that is pretty fucking rare.

2465
02:19:42.840 --> 02:19:47.540
I like what the people in Iceland like they named Greenland,

2466
02:19:47.541 --> 02:19:51.800
Greenland,
and Iceland.
Iceland.
So the Vikings would attack Greenland and Iceland.

2467
02:19:51.920 --> 02:19:55.490
Really?
Yeah.
Did they really?
Yeah,
because Iceland is actually,

2468
02:19:55.520 --> 02:20:00.520
the greener area is Iceland and Greenland is more ice and stuff.

2469
02:20:00.741 --> 02:20:04.250
I've never been there but isolated.
Apparently they named it that way,
you know,

2470
02:20:04.251 --> 02:20:07.370
to,
to trick the vikings so they wouldn't come up and rape their women.

2471
02:20:07.430 --> 02:20:10.350
That's hilarious.
But Iceland is a,
the place,
uh,

2472
02:20:12.150 --> 02:20:14.840
w how cold is Iceland yet?
I have no idea

2473
02:20:16.490 --> 02:20:18.710
what just happened in Iceland.
Something just happened there,
right?

2474
02:20:18.770 --> 02:20:22.540
They are the bankers.
They were holding him accountable.
Yes.
Here's that.

2475
02:20:22.550 --> 02:20:24.560
The trial there.
Yeah.
What do,

2476
02:20:24.590 --> 02:20:29.450
what do I get as much media coverage in the United States?
Because A,

2477
02:20:29.510 --> 02:20:33.550
we don't want to give our citizens the idea that we should try bankers.

2478
02:20:33.551 --> 02:20:35.120
That fucking collapsed our system.

2479
02:20:35.270 --> 02:20:39.020
They also had an the volcanoes active volcano two yeah.
What a,
yeah.

2480
02:20:39.021 --> 02:20:42.890
That was like a year or two ago and all this volcanic ash went all over Europe

2481
02:20:42.891 --> 02:20:45.080
and they did cancel flights and stuff.
Did you see that?

2482
02:20:45.081 --> 02:20:47.990
It was crazy driving dark cloud over it.
Yeah.

2483
02:20:48.080 --> 02:20:50.000
It's like they were driving and volcanics Chanel,

2484
02:20:50.900 --> 02:20:53.360
so they're holding the bankers accountable.
That's what's going on over that.

2485
02:20:53.361 --> 02:20:56.480
Few of them are on trial.
Oh Man.
Yeah.

2486
02:20:56.481 --> 02:20:59.870
It's like you have to almost have to be a small European country to figure out

2487
02:20:59.871 --> 02:21:01.520
how to do it completely correctly.

2488
02:21:01.910 --> 02:21:04.160
It's like when you become as big as the United States is,

2489
02:21:04.161 --> 02:21:07.970
it's like small European countries are really like states and it's like Texas

2490
02:21:07.971 --> 02:21:10.670
could probably be fine if it was left on its own,
you know?
I mean,

2491
02:21:10.671 --> 02:21:11.990
that's essentially how Europe is.

2492
02:21:11.991 --> 02:21:14.860
There's European countries that are smaller than Texas and I'll stay.

2493
02:21:14.880 --> 02:21:17.800
They're the only ones that could really get it together,
like fucking controls.

2494
02:21:18.260 --> 02:21:20.420
I think there's just a lot of people that don't give a shit in this country.

2495
02:21:20.421 --> 02:21:23.990
And that was what I found refreshing about the occupy movement.
It was like,
wow,

2496
02:21:23.991 --> 02:21:25.250
it's good to see that.
You know,

2497
02:21:25.610 --> 02:21:30.610
some people in this country are passionate enough to get out and protest.

2498
02:21:30.770 --> 02:21:34.010
Well the youth,
the people that don't have a lot invested already in the system.

2499
02:21:34.011 --> 02:21:36.620
The real problem is once people can invest in the system and they have a

2500
02:21:36.621 --> 02:21:40.970
mortgage and they have,
children are paying credit cards,
student loans,
boom,

2501
02:21:40.971 --> 02:21:43.040
you're sucked in with your lease,
your car payment,

2502
02:21:43.520 --> 02:21:47.390
you're sucked in and you gotta,
you gotta come continue to at least feed,

2503
02:21:47.600 --> 02:21:49.040
you know,
your portion of the system.

2504
02:21:49.040 --> 02:21:51.710
So that's all your motivation and energy has gone eight hours a day.

2505
02:21:51.711 --> 02:21:54.350
You're gone eight hours a day,
at least five days a week,

2506
02:21:54.351 --> 02:21:57.890
six if you have any ambition and all your piece of shit and that's you,

2507
02:21:57.920 --> 02:21:59.480
that's your life.
And what are you going to do for the route?

2508
02:21:59.481 --> 02:22:01.700
You've got a couple of hours left in the day where you going to eat and catch

2509
02:22:01.701 --> 02:22:06.470
your breath and jerk off.
And really probably barely get to the gym,
you know,

2510
02:22:06.471 --> 02:22:10.250
I mean,
there's no revolution time.
So when you get these kids in there,
you know,

2511
02:22:10.280 --> 02:22:13.160
18 years old and they got no future and they're looking at the future and

2512
02:22:13.161 --> 02:22:13.951
they're like,
you know what,
I,

2513
02:22:13.951 --> 02:22:17.810
I saw this one kid that actually said that he was like,
I'm joining a revolution.

2514
02:22:18.230 --> 02:22:20.060
He goes,
I realized that I can't,

2515
02:22:20.150 --> 02:22:23.450
I can't enter into a system that I have no faith in,
so write at a college.

2516
02:22:23.451 --> 02:22:26.040
I'm just joining a revolution and I'm going to be a part of this

2517
02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:30.220
<v 0>movement.
Hopefully it's not the Pepsi Revolution.
Oh,</v>

2518
02:22:30.270 --> 02:22:31.290
I don't think that's what he was talking to.

2519
02:22:31.320 --> 02:22:32.790
<v 8>Like,
you know,
you look at you,
they'll get,
you know,</v>

2520
02:22:32.800 --> 02:22:36.550
people in the sixties and seventies they stopped Vietnam and it,
there was

2521
02:22:36.660 --> 02:22:37.420
<v 0>not really,</v>

2522
02:22:37.420 --> 02:22:41.580
it took a long ass fucking time and they had no other way to justify it anymore

2523
02:22:41.850 --> 02:22:44.820
and they stopped something that they created under false pretenses.

2524
02:22:44.821 --> 02:22:49.350
They created a war or the fake the fucking incident to drag us into it.
Yeah,

2525
02:22:49.370 --> 02:22:51.620
<v 8>that's right.
But that goes back to the Spanish American war.</v>

2526
02:22:51.621 --> 02:22:54.560
There was an incident in the Havana harbor in Cuba.

2527
02:22:54.561 --> 02:22:58.880
Spain had a Cuba and the Philippines and we said that some ship had been

2528
02:22:58.881 --> 02:23:02.630
attacked of hours.
Uh,
I think it was the Bismarck.
What year was this?

2529
02:23:03.040 --> 02:23:06.440
I don't know.
We've always done it right.
And then so yeah,

2530
02:23:06.441 --> 02:23:09.530
and then so we went to war with Spain and we got Cuba and the Philippines.

2531
02:23:09.710 --> 02:23:10.220
Well the

2532
02:23:10.220 --> 02:23:14.150
<v 0>Looney tooney people believe that this kid in Colorado is a government plan.</v>

2533
02:23:14.320 --> 02:23:15.320
<v 2>I heard that.
Well,</v>

2534
02:23:15.580 --> 02:23:20.170
did you see the photos of like looking at his nose from the original photo they

2535
02:23:20.171 --> 02:23:25.030
posted that kid's nose is like really fan and then his like recent pictures,

2536
02:23:25.060 --> 02:23:28.090
he's got like a spread out nose that looks completely different and they're

2537
02:23:28.091 --> 02:23:32.710
saying like his ears don't match the old photo and like all this weird stupid

2538
02:23:32.711 --> 02:23:36.340
stuff.
It's ridiculous.
I'd looked at the photos,
I'm like,
this is just the first,

2539
02:23:36.341 --> 02:23:39.220
they're not,
these aren't crystal clear photos like sometimes in photos,

2540
02:23:39.221 --> 02:23:43.210
things like VOD and he's smiling and one your nose kind of stretches my nose

2541
02:23:43.211 --> 02:23:47.200
flares.
The idea is that he was somehow or another brainwashed and,

2542
02:23:47.201 --> 02:23:48.010
and sat in there

2543
02:23:48.010 --> 02:23:51.640
<v 0>by the government so that they could take away our guns.
This was the,</v>

2544
02:23:51.641 --> 02:23:53.740
this is the narrative is that,
you know,

2545
02:23:53.741 --> 02:23:58.510
from the really extreme Alex Jones type individuals who believed that the

2546
02:23:58.511 --> 02:24:01.900
government is constantly plotting to take away your guns and slowly,

2547
02:24:01.901 --> 02:24:06.310
and you know,
he's,
he's right more than he's wrong.
Unfortunately.
Alex Jones,

2548
02:24:06.380 --> 02:24:08.080
<v 8>thank God there is an Alex Jones.</v>

2549
02:24:08.100 --> 02:24:13.100
I love the fact that there's this guy who is stirring up a things and he,

2550
02:24:13.421 --> 02:24:17.810
he's,
he's a,
he's lifting up stones and saying,
let's look under there.
You know,

2551
02:24:18.080 --> 02:24:21.150
he's fine and like ghost worms and shit.
Yeah.
I mean some of them,

2552
02:24:21.170 --> 02:24:25.520
some of it's Wacky,
but I,
I appreciate it.
Alex Jones.
I,
I like what he's doing.

2553
02:24:25.550 --> 02:24:30.390
I do too.
You know,
and then we,
you know,
he's a great guy.
Yeah,
he's awesome.

2554
02:24:30.410 --> 02:24:31.230
Great Guy.
Love

2555
02:24:31.230 --> 02:24:34.590
<v 0>hanging out with him.
He's a great guy.
He actually just sent me a text today.</v>

2556
02:24:34.800 --> 02:24:38.190
I'm not name dropping and nothing,
but I'm like that with Alex Jones.

2557
02:24:38.370 --> 02:24:40.740
I look at any texts that comes from him.
I'm like,
hello government

2558
02:24:42.660 --> 02:24:43.860
for sure you're reading this one.

2559
02:24:44.180 --> 02:24:46.670
I know you're not going to get anything to interest together be,

2560
02:24:46.680 --> 02:24:50.430
but Alex Jones might send you some interesting stuff.
I fucking guy,
man,

2561
02:24:50.431 --> 02:24:54.900
he'll uncover everything constantly,
all day,
every day and never take days off.

2562
02:24:55.710 --> 02:24:59.070
But he,
he believes,
how does he come up with all this information?

2563
02:24:59.071 --> 02:24:59.650
It's incredible.

2564
02:24:59.650 --> 02:25:03.300
I own the Internet and he's got a whole crew of people working for him in
Austin.

2565
02:25:03.340 --> 02:25:08.100
He's got a,
like a whole big office staff full of young killers,

2566
02:25:08.340 --> 02:25:08.521
you know,

2567
02:25:08.521 --> 02:25:11.310
young people that are like hungry and want to be down with the cause and they're

2568
02:25:11.311 --> 02:25:12.144
all working with them.

2569
02:25:12.270 --> 02:25:16.590
He's on an empire now or Alex Jones has a chai can tick like sort of underground

2570
02:25:16.591 --> 02:25:20.850
media empire,
but he's uh,
couldn't be doing any better than he's doing.

2571
02:25:21.240 --> 02:25:23.830
I mean it's like more the more and more his,
uh,

2572
02:25:23.890 --> 02:25:25.960
shit comes out and turns out to be true.

2573
02:25:26.170 --> 02:25:29.200
The more people just are at least paying attention to them.

2574
02:25:29.201 --> 02:25:32.170
You might not believe with everything he has to say cause sometimes he does go

2575
02:25:32.171 --> 02:25:35.350
deep,
but at least they're paying attention to him because he's,
you know,

2576
02:25:35.410 --> 02:25:39.550
did you see the shit that he predicted about it was a video called nine one one

2577
02:25:39.551 --> 02:25:41.860
road to tyranny.
And he had a,

2578
02:25:42.190 --> 02:25:46.280
he showed how governments have created chaos in,

2579
02:25:46.290 --> 02:25:47.920
in sort of in peaceful situation,

2580
02:25:48.520 --> 02:25:52.600
in order to allow the police and Rikers to come in and clear out peaceful

2581
02:25:52.601 --> 02:25:56.170
demonstrations.
And I had never thought that that was real.
I never,

2582
02:25:56.171 --> 02:25:57.160
I felt like that's crazy.

2583
02:25:57.310 --> 02:26:00.700
But he showed it and it showed evidence of photographs of these people wearing

2584
02:26:00.701 --> 02:26:03.700
military grade boots.
These cops that were,
uh,

2585
02:26:03.840 --> 02:26:06.340
dressed up like a hooligans,

2586
02:26:06.490 --> 02:26:10.360
they would smash windows and they were like sending their employees of the

2587
02:26:10.361 --> 02:26:15.361
federal government sent in there to cause havoc and rec per private property so

2588
02:26:15.371 --> 02:26:19.480
that they could bring in cops and closed down the peaceful protests or the World

2589
02:26:19.480 --> 02:26:22.300
Trade Organization.
And it's nuts.
You watch it and you go,
well,

2590
02:26:22.301 --> 02:26:26.470
you can't deny this.
This is something you can't deny.
Like this is what these,

2591
02:26:26.471 --> 02:26:29.860
these are the facts.
Those guys did do that.
The cops didn't negotiate with them.

2592
02:26:29.861 --> 02:26:34.010
They were released.
No charges were filed.
They really did break up the protest.

2593
02:26:34.011 --> 02:26:37.360
They really did stop people from wearing pins that's,

2594
02:26:37.390 --> 02:26:39.100
that had protests on them.

2595
02:26:39.400 --> 02:26:43.810
They had a WTO with a red line on it and they establish a line where you could

2596
02:26:43.811 --> 02:26:47.440
not come through with that pin on.
They established a no protesting line.

2597
02:26:47.650 --> 02:26:51.190
Even in what you are wearing.
That's,

2598
02:26:51.330 --> 02:26:54.550
that's some communist fucking North Korea type Shit,
man.

2599
02:26:54.850 --> 02:26:58.210
You can't even have a WTO pin with a red line through it.

2600
02:26:58.450 --> 02:27:02.050
I have to like say,
even though I'm saying nothing,

2601
02:27:02.051 --> 02:27:04.450
I have to subscribe to your ideology or I can't get through.

2602
02:27:04.660 --> 02:27:07.600
I can't even protest in the form of a pin.
That's that.

2603
02:27:07.700 --> 02:27:11.860
That anybody would allow that.
Like that is the most dangerous mind,

2604
02:27:12.040 --> 02:27:14.980
the most dangerous mindset that our government could ever have.

2605
02:27:15.280 --> 02:27:19.300
That you can't even just have a red line through this idea of a WTO.

2606
02:27:19.420 --> 02:27:22.990
I can't get to work.
I can't go into my room.
Really.

2607
02:27:24.370 --> 02:27:27.850
Alex Jones,
he uncovered all that shit.
So for people that don't believe in,

2608
02:27:27.851 --> 02:27:30.130
I'm like,
there's a lot of stuff that guy gets.
That's right.

2609
02:27:30.520 --> 02:27:34.270
Undisputable the fucking,
the Oklahoma City Shit.

2610
02:27:34.510 --> 02:27:38.920
That's some of the scariest stuff ever,
man.
When he,
uh,
goes deep into the,
uh,

2611
02:27:38.950 --> 02:27:42.390
the mysteries behind Oklahoma City,
that,
that,
uh,
the,

2612
02:27:42.391 --> 02:27:44.770
the damage that was done by that fertilizer bomb,

2613
02:27:44.771 --> 02:27:48.360
the video of the FBI pulling on,
uh,

2614
02:27:48.660 --> 02:27:53.010
an blown bombs out of the building.
You know,
it's crazy.
It's crazy.

2615
02:27:53.050 --> 02:27:55.150
Conspiracies are nuts,
man.
It's so,

2616
02:27:55.151 --> 02:27:58.840
it's such a mind fuck to think there's so many people out there conspiring to do

2617
02:27:58.841 --> 02:28:02.380
creepy shit.
And you've got to like break each one down,
you know,

2618
02:28:02.410 --> 02:28:05.350
decades later still trying to figure out who killed Kennedy.
Huh?

2619
02:28:05.351 --> 02:28:07.900
Fuck did they do it?
What happened?
Well,
Oklahoma City,

2620
02:28:07.901 --> 02:28:10.680
no fertilizer bombs and do that kind of damage.
Ah,
you know,

2621
02:28:10.930 --> 02:28:15.100
mind fuck you into a state of paralysis where you can't get anything done.

2622
02:28:15.101 --> 02:28:19.240
We're all going to do is thinking about who would thermite in nine 11,
you know,

2623
02:28:19.810 --> 02:28:21.650
fucking thermite and cut through these beams.

2624
02:28:21.651 --> 02:28:26.180
And I had to tell her seven fall man,
how did towers have it fall?

2625
02:28:26.420 --> 02:28:28.450
You could lose your whole life and then she,
right,

2626
02:28:30.910 --> 02:28:35.680
<v 10>but then again,
you know someone's got to bring it up.
Right.</v>

2627
02:28:36.290 --> 02:28:38.450
<v 6>Keep these bastards on their toes as well.</v>

2628
02:28:38.520 --> 02:28:42.840
<v 0>Does it work?
Does it work?
Tom Ross?
I don't know.
Do you think is,</v>

2629
02:28:43.470 --> 02:28:47.520
is there anything that is going to keep tyranny on its toes other than exposing

2630
02:28:47.610 --> 02:28:51.890
other than information?
I think as we lose all of our privacy,
that's what's up

2631
02:28:51.940 --> 02:28:52.751
<v 6>eventually.
That's the thing.</v>

2632
02:28:52.751 --> 02:28:55.510
I think it's naturally going to happen because it's just so,

2633
02:28:55.830 --> 02:28:58.970
<v 0>yeah,
hard did keep things suppressed anymore.
Yeah.</v>

2634
02:28:58.971 --> 02:29:01.220
It's hard to fuck people over when everybody's going to know everything that

2635
02:29:01.221 --> 02:29:03.980
everybody's doing all the time.
That's what the reality is.

2636
02:29:04.010 --> 02:29:06.800
The future is going to have no privacy.
Yeah.

2637
02:29:06.970 --> 02:29:09.180
<v 6>Just Twitter alone fucking destroyed that.</v>

2638
02:29:09.210 --> 02:29:12.710
Joe Rogan's at the olive garden with an Asian girl.
You had to say it.

2639
02:29:12.711 --> 02:29:16.900
You mother Fucker Olive Garden,
you son of a bitch.
Seven seven,
seven,
seven.

2640
02:29:17.090 --> 02:29:20.450
Brian is on an Asian kid alleys and when you referenced a girl,

2641
02:29:20.451 --> 02:29:24.140
it's always an Asian girl any bit.
Yeah.
So they were there with an Asian girl,

2642
02:29:24.141 --> 02:29:28.070
try new Asian material.
I know that it's all,
everything is all Asian these days.

2643
02:29:28.240 --> 02:29:32.840
Kids whacking the kids where I have this new theory that I told you about the

2644
02:29:32.840 --> 02:29:35.810
other day and I talked about it more last night with a couple of other people

2645
02:29:36.080 --> 02:29:37.640
about how my friend,

2646
02:29:37.641 --> 02:29:42.641
she's Japanese and I've been trying to talk as if I'm talking Japanese,

2647
02:29:42.741 --> 02:29:47.300
like doing like my impersonate personation of a Japanese person.

2648
02:29:47.301 --> 02:29:51.830
So I'm going like,
Oh Yada,
Yada Yada.
And then every couple sentences she goes,
oh,

2649
02:29:51.831 --> 02:29:56.300
you just said a real word.
You said you know apple or you said Taco.
And I'm like,

2650
02:29:56.301 --> 02:30:00.430
wow,
that's weird.
I wonder if like I do Chinese if I'm like bawling,
Dong,

2651
02:30:00.431 --> 02:30:02.720
Dong Dong.
And they're like,
you know,
that's apple,

2652
02:30:02.750 --> 02:30:04.640
you know that you just said a real Chinese word.

2653
02:30:04.700 --> 02:30:07.700
And that's just our impersonation of that,
that you know,

2654
02:30:07.701 --> 02:30:11.150
almost are racist version of what we think they sound like.

2655
02:30:11.240 --> 02:30:14.960
But yet there's some truth to it.
And so then I asked my Asian friend,
I'm like,

2656
02:30:15.050 --> 02:30:17.630
what do people that don't speak English?

2657
02:30:17.690 --> 02:30:22.180
Like what's their version of an English person?
Is it just like,
you know,

2658
02:30:22.190 --> 02:30:25.760
like I said,
our retard sound or something?
Don't you remember that song?

2659
02:30:26.090 --> 02:30:28.700
<v 0>Do you remember that song that the Italian guy and put out,</v>

2660
02:30:28.850 --> 02:30:32.870
he was a famous Italian singer and he put out a song that was his version of

2661
02:30:32.871 --> 02:30:35.210
like us doing time.
Like I don't know how to speak Italian.
Oh,

2662
02:30:35.300 --> 02:30:40.100
so if I was like [inaudible],
if I was making up words,
that's what he did.

2663
02:30:40.101 --> 02:30:44.050
But he did it.
And what American sounds to him,
pull that up.
It's a,

2664
02:30:44.120 --> 02:30:47.970
I think it's how the American language sounds.
Here.
I'll go,

2665
02:30:47.971 --> 02:30:52.370
I'll Google it real quick.
I think as a,
Tom Rhodes got a little baby bladder,

2666
02:30:52.520 --> 02:30:55.330
look at that huge cocaine addiction.

2667
02:30:56.690 --> 02:30:59.290
How American English sounds.
Yeah.

2668
02:31:00.210 --> 02:31:03.720
<v 10>Yeah.
Rebut,</v>

2669
02:31:05.060 --> 02:31:06.070
um,

2670
02:31:06.330 --> 02:31:08.880
<v 0>tell sounds to foreigners how American English,
that's it.</v>

2671
02:31:09.030 --> 02:31:12.390
How about what American English sounds to foreigners.

2672
02:31:12.660 --> 02:31:13.493
<v 10>Okay.</v>

2673
02:31:14.850 --> 02:31:17.340
<v 0>And then go to videos.
Foreigners.</v>

2674
02:31:17.341 --> 02:31:19.950
Here we go and go to videos and you'll see the top.
There's a

2675
02:31:20.190 --> 02:31:22.680
<v 6>black and white one.
Click on that shit.
That's this guy.</v>

2676
02:31:22.681 --> 02:31:27.330
It's really a Badass song.
Joey Dee has gotten mad.
Yeah,
I think we,
yeah,
maybe.

2677
02:31:27.370 --> 02:31:28.203
Yes.
Yeah.
Turn Up

2678
02:31:28.240 --> 02:31:33.110
<v 11>Deacon [inaudible].</v>

2679
02:31:34.120 --> 02:31:34.953
<v 12>Well,
what happened?</v>

2680
02:31:35.840 --> 02:31:40.840
<v 11>Freezing cold in [inaudible] nine to [inaudible] Salem freezing cold in Madison.</v>

2681
02:31:42.050 --> 02:31:43.920
I Jews off.
All right.

2682
02:31:45.050 --> 02:31:46.220
<v 13>These are all fake words.</v>

2683
02:31:49.350 --> 02:31:50.750
This is actually pretty bad ass

2684
02:31:54.260 --> 02:31:59.260
pretending is when the same shoes now and hoping to see the [inaudible].

2685
02:32:06.400 --> 02:32:09.200
I became the Co.
They miss a stay yet

2686
02:32:16.140 --> 02:32:17.260
hoping to see him.

2687
02:32:17.280 --> 02:32:21.980
Then rate maybe we used to call the boss ties pocket.
Bad Ass.

2688
02:32:22.280 --> 02:32:24.950
What does this Italian,
yeah,
it's no,
it's nuts.

2689
02:32:25.010 --> 02:32:28.290
Jibberish it's him trying to do television.

2690
02:32:28.450 --> 02:32:32.650
It's what his version would.
American sound like crazy,

2691
02:32:34.790 --> 02:32:36.920
but this all the time.

2692
02:32:41.930 --> 02:32:46.040
Susan Global Bank,
you have a customer that's called your brain to girls.

2693
02:32:49.150 --> 02:32:53.210
These bits.
That's crazy as fuck.
Yeah.
That's not a smart move,
man.

2694
02:32:53.211 --> 02:32:56.810
Just put a bunch of hot bitches dancing.
Right.
Great.
Listen to this.

2695
02:32:56.910 --> 02:32:57.743
This is the cool part.

2696
02:33:02.530 --> 02:33:03.860
They actually had like lyrics.

2697
02:33:11.270 --> 02:33:12.290
What does this dude's name?

2698
02:33:21.200 --> 02:33:25.190
Adriano's sell it ton.
Yeah,
he was,

2699
02:33:25.440 --> 02:33:29.280
apparently he was a famous guy,
Eddie cannabis.
It's pretty bad.

2700
02:33:30.910 --> 02:33:32.630
<v 6>And that's exactly what I was talking about.</v>

2701
02:33:32.631 --> 02:33:35.750
Like I didn't really know if that even existed cause you,
you know,

2702
02:33:35.751 --> 02:33:39.050
you always hear the like on TV and stuff,
you always hear like the,

2703
02:33:39.200 --> 02:33:41.660
the version of a Chinese person or you know,

2704
02:33:41.661 --> 02:33:44.960
or an African says a bunch of clicking noises and stuff.
Yeah.
But like you don't,

2705
02:33:44.990 --> 02:33:48.800
you don't know what English sounds like.
And it makes me wonder,
like,

2706
02:33:48.801 --> 02:33:51.620
you could tell that he had a couple of words in there that were like,
all right.

2707
02:33:51.621 --> 02:33:53.390
And stuff like that.
Yeah.
But uh,

2708
02:33:53.690 --> 02:33:58.520
but it's really weird trying to play that game and trying to find Japanese like

2709
02:33:58.521 --> 02:34:01.100
words.
Like I've almost made it a game where I'm just like,
all right here.

2710
02:34:01.210 --> 02:34:06.080
All right,
am I do this,
uh,
call y'all know [inaudible] you,
you know,

2711
02:34:06.100 --> 02:34:09.010
and then she'll be like,
oh,
you just said good morning and shoelaces.

2712
02:34:09.230 --> 02:34:10.760
And I'm like,
wow,
that's so weird.

2713
02:34:10.990 --> 02:34:13.880
It makes you almost wonder if it's somewhere built in your brain that you

2714
02:34:13.881 --> 02:34:15.110
actually know it.
Yeah.

2715
02:34:15.420 --> 02:34:18.130
<v 13>I know you're getting lucky.
And up fake words</v>

2716
02:34:18.710 --> 02:34:21.190
<v 8>was only a certain amount of Chinese sounds you can make with your mom.</v>

2717
02:34:22.390 --> 02:34:23.740
That's funny.
Well,

2718
02:34:23.840 --> 02:34:27.850
the language is very bizarre that like the Germans have such an [inaudible],

2719
02:34:28.100 --> 02:34:30.420
you know,
it's like what,
what,
what causes these,

2720
02:34:30.480 --> 02:34:34.630
these different like harsh sounds.
Right.
And it like Francis,
you know,

2721
02:34:34.631 --> 02:34:38.530
borders it and it's,
they speak a different language completely.
Yeah.

2722
02:34:38.730 --> 02:34:42.940
It's incredible.
Yeah.
It's bizarre.
When she speaks Japanese to you,

2723
02:34:42.941 --> 02:34:47.200
was it kind of tripping it?
Yeah,
it's super weird.
It's,
I think it's crazy.

2724
02:34:47.620 --> 02:34:51.910
I think,
uh,
um,
you Rishi.
Yeah.
Rishi.

2725
02:34:52.870 --> 02:34:53.703
Are you happy?

2726
02:34:54.300 --> 02:34:58.070
<v 0>Yeah.
If you were going to learn a language,
that's a rough one.
We'll do the,</v>

2727
02:34:58.071 --> 02:34:59.880
just the getting into the character thing again,

2728
02:35:00.540 --> 02:35:05.010
anything Spanish or semi European probably be fairly easiest for us to wrap our

2729
02:35:05.011 --> 02:35:05.844
heads around.
But,

2730
02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:07.910
<v 8>and then all of these different countries I've gone to,
I've asked people,</v>

2731
02:35:07.911 --> 02:35:11.270
how do you say,
are you happy?
Like in Dutch it's Ben,
you Holger.

2732
02:35:12.350 --> 02:35:13.820
In Japanese it's your Rishi.

2733
02:35:15.380 --> 02:35:17.510
I think that's the one question I want to ask people when I'm in a different

2734
02:35:17.511 --> 02:35:18.590
country.
It's a good question.

2735
02:35:18.720 --> 02:35:21.020
Are you asking to learn Dutch when you lived in Holland?

2736
02:35:21.170 --> 02:35:26.060
I Kline Beecham Manir a hell Moines avant.
Huh?
I don't know.

2737
02:35:26.150 --> 02:35:31.040
I mean,
she's asking you a question.
Don't gotta get fucking no,
not fluently.

2738
02:35:31.041 --> 02:35:34.850
I just know basic like cordial things.
But you were living there,
right?

2739
02:35:34.851 --> 02:35:39.620
Did you feel the need?
Like,
you know,
uh,
they are really strict on,

2740
02:35:39.680 --> 02:35:44.060
uh,
brown skin,
foreigners learning the language.
Uh,

2741
02:35:44.061 --> 02:35:48.230
if you're white,
I guess they are not as strict brown skin foreigners.

2742
02:35:48.231 --> 02:35:51.890
They don't want you to like,
yeah,
like a lot of Moroccan people live there and,

2743
02:35:51.891 --> 02:35:54.470
um,
they are really,
uh,

2744
02:35:54.620 --> 02:35:59.540
tough on them and you got to learn the language.
But,
um,
yeah,
no,

2745
02:35:59.660 --> 02:36:02.840
I,
I got by,
Oh,
I see what you're saying.
So they're,
they,

2746
02:36:02.841 --> 02:36:05.260
they hold them more accountable.
They hold,

2747
02:36:05.320 --> 02:36:08.210
they hold a dark skinned immigrants more accountable than

2748
02:36:08.870 --> 02:36:11.470
<v 0>I'm Moroccans,
like known to be like wild.
Is that the deal?</v>

2749
02:36:11.710 --> 02:36:15.880
<v 8>Well,
it's interesting,
their breakdown,
they're kind of like,
um,
uh,
our American,</v>

2750
02:36:16.260 --> 02:36:19.840
a black youth where they get blamed for everything.

2751
02:36:19.841 --> 02:36:24.580
The teenage boys get blamed for all the crime and um,
uh,

2752
02:36:24.610 --> 02:36:29.140
it's,
you know,
uh,
did their,
you know,
typical gang bangers,

2753
02:36:29.141 --> 02:36:32.890
but it's,
it's like immediate perception.
They get a,
they're the,

2754
02:36:33.160 --> 02:36:36.420
they're the um,
shit on people there.
Do you know who

2755
02:36:36.620 --> 02:36:40.140
<v 0>Badr Hari is?
You ever heard of him?
No.
Famous Holland dies.</v>

2756
02:36:40.150 --> 02:36:42.530
I tick box or like one of the best kickbox is in the world,

2757
02:36:42.830 --> 02:36:44.330
keeps getting is a Moroccan guy,

2758
02:36:44.370 --> 02:36:47.110
keeps getting arrested for beating people up outside.

2759
02:36:47.120 --> 02:36:50.600
He's like heavyweight kickboxing champion and fucks people up on the street.

2760
02:36:50.630 --> 02:36:51.890
Nice.
Yeah.

2761
02:36:52.250 --> 02:36:56.270
<v 8>Oh,
him fucking people I've met no on this.
Nice that he's such a great fighter.</v>

2762
02:36:56.680 --> 02:36:58.060
And then he's from Holland and these were on,

2763
02:36:58.070 --> 02:37:02.900
but he Rockins are known to be wild folks.
No,
I uh,
I mean,
you know,

2764
02:37:02.901 --> 02:37:07.790
they're,
they,
they kind of blamed for crime and things there,
but uh,
yeah,

2765
02:37:07.820 --> 02:37:11.170
there's,
there's some Moroccans that are bad asses.
Did you feel overall safer?

2766
02:37:11.190 --> 02:37:16.130
They're here.
Uh,
I have like a existence there.

2767
02:37:16.130 --> 02:37:16.440
<v 4>You know,</v>

2768
02:37:16.440 --> 02:37:21.440
I lived there for WWE for a love story first and then I was on television for a

2769
02:37:21.770 --> 02:37:26.630
few years and,
and I really got to,
um,
experience Dutch culture.

2770
02:37:26.631 --> 02:37:30.140
Like even a lot of Dutch people don't like I had this magic passport on the

2771
02:37:30.141 --> 02:37:31.520
country.
Uh,

2772
02:37:31.550 --> 02:37:34.700
my favorite thing about the talk show was every episode I would make a five

2773
02:37:34.701 --> 02:37:38.900
minute film on Dutch culture where I would get to experience something of Dutch

2774
02:37:38.901 --> 02:37:42.950
culture.
Like I spent a day with a Dutch farmer once a,

2775
02:37:42.951 --> 02:37:44.780
I walked into an electric fence.
He said,

2776
02:37:44.781 --> 02:37:47.960
look out for the electric fence in Dutch.
I don't speak Dutch.
Uh,

2777
02:37:47.961 --> 02:37:51.110
I got to go to the,
I got to go to the feel like,
oh,
it was a,

2778
02:37:51.111 --> 02:37:54.500
it was an eye opener.
Yeah,
it was a,
it was jolting.
Uh,

2779
02:37:54.501 --> 02:37:56.330
I got to cover the prime minister debates.

2780
02:37:56.331 --> 02:37:59.780
I was down on the floor talking to the prime minister and they did an English.

2781
02:37:59.930 --> 02:38:02.630
Uh,
well,
I mean there are debates were in Dutch.
I mean,
I was there,

2782
02:38:02.631 --> 02:38:05.390
I was there with a press pass after the debates.

2783
02:38:06.260 --> 02:38:10.100
I got to ask questions,
but I was given a,
uh,
you know,

2784
02:38:10.101 --> 02:38:13.910
all these different tours of the red light district by a former prostitute that

2785
02:38:13.911 --> 02:38:17.750
did a lot of social work for,
um,
you know,
prostitutes,

2786
02:38:17.751 --> 02:38:20.900
so they get their health care and pay their taxes and stuff.
Uh,

2787
02:38:20.940 --> 02:38:23.870
so I had this really magical experience here.
I,

2788
02:38:23.871 --> 02:38:28.871
I did actually date a Moroccan woman there for a while and it was interesting

2789
02:38:29.781 --> 02:38:33.980
because she was a really developed a European girl,

2790
02:38:34.280 --> 02:38:38.240
but to her strict Muslim family,
she was a different person.

2791
02:38:38.960 --> 02:38:42.170
Like she put on an act,
she could go out with me and you know,

2792
02:38:42.171 --> 02:38:47.090
have drinks and gonna Freak on dude,
you know,
non non Muslim activities,
Shit,

2793
02:38:47.120 --> 02:38:50.570
right in front of her family.
And so she could never tell their family about me.

2794
02:38:50.900 --> 02:38:54.960
Um,
partly because,
uh,
honor killings,
honor killings.

2795
02:38:55.680 --> 02:38:59.300
Yeah.
And I told her,
I told her once,
I said,
you know,
uh,
you know why,
uh,
you know,

2796
02:38:59.301 --> 02:39:03.320
you can't,
you tell your family about me.
And she said,
well,
uh,
I'm protecting you.

2797
02:39:03.710 --> 02:39:05.730
She goes,
I got some crazy cousins.
I don't know what they're [inaudible]

2798
02:39:05.750 --> 02:39:10.250
<v 0>capable of.
Oh,
that's some dangerous pussy.</v>

2799
02:39:10.251 --> 02:39:13.220
Tom Rhodes.
Could you feel that sense of danger while you were in that?

2800
02:39:13.810 --> 02:39:15.350
Did you feel that?
No,
she was,
yeah.

2801
02:39:15.370 --> 02:39:17.980
<v 4>Well you're making,
I think it was a bit,
but that was a very typical,</v>

2802
02:39:18.310 --> 02:39:22.720
very typical,
a Dutch story that did this,
you know,

2803
02:39:22.721 --> 02:39:26.650
Moroccan girl is,
you know,
she's raised in Europe.
She's very liberal,

2804
02:39:26.651 --> 02:39:29.620
open minded person,
but to her strict religious family,

2805
02:39:29.621 --> 02:39:30.550
she was a different person.

2806
02:39:30.600 --> 02:39:32.670
<v 0>Those were the last holdouts.
Those,</v>

2807
02:39:32.700 --> 02:39:35.940
those folks that want people to stick with their religion or stick with the
race,

2808
02:39:35.941 --> 02:39:39.750
those are the last holdouts of a dying generation of people that didn't want us

2809
02:39:39.751 --> 02:39:42.420
emulate.
I think once,
once we,
uh,

2810
02:39:42.421 --> 02:39:47.421
achieve the next level of assimilation with technology,

2811
02:39:48.060 --> 02:39:49.260
you know,
whatever it is,
whatever,

2812
02:39:49.261 --> 02:39:52.350
whatever's come that's going to make Twitter look like,
you know,

2813
02:39:52.380 --> 02:39:54.720
look like fucking sketches written on a,

2814
02:39:55.020 --> 02:39:58.800
on a wall somewhere as opposed to HD definition television and now whatever the

2815
02:39:58.801 --> 02:39:59.860
next thing is going to be,

2816
02:40:00.500 --> 02:40:03.540
<v 4>it's going to bring him out.
My wife was your most worn,
but she's a,
she's,</v>

2817
02:40:03.541 --> 02:40:04.374
she's Indian.

2818
02:40:05.300 --> 02:40:08.780
<v 0>So do you think that language is eventually move on to one language?
I mean,</v>

2819
02:40:08.781 --> 02:40:09.230
is that it?

2820
02:40:09.230 --> 02:40:11.510
<v 4>Well,
I think we hit the lottery as far as language goes,</v>

2821
02:40:11.511 --> 02:40:14.490
especially if you're a comedian.
There's all these great gigs all over the world.

2822
02:40:14.491 --> 02:40:18.900
And as an English is the language of business the way 300 years ago,

2823
02:40:18.901 --> 02:40:23.190
the worldwide language of business was French.
If you had a,
you know,

2824
02:40:23.191 --> 02:40:27.360
a global business,
you had to do your stuff in French,
now it's English.

2825
02:40:27.420 --> 02:40:29.850
<v 0>Could you imagine though,
if the world spoken one,</v>

2826
02:40:29.851 --> 02:40:32.940
I mean that's the whole idea about the tower of Babel,
right?
Who said that would,

2827
02:40:32.960 --> 02:40:36.060
it was designed that way to confuse us,
to keep us from progressing.

2828
02:40:36.240 --> 02:40:38.070
They gave us all a bunch of different languages.

2829
02:40:38.071 --> 02:40:40.980
We all got baffled and we went off in separate ways and we couldn't communicate

2830
02:40:40.981 --> 02:40:42.020
with each other.
So

2831
02:40:42.270 --> 02:40:47.010
<v 4>as I tell you,
what's weird is a,
a friend of mine,
um,
I,</v>

2832
02:40:47.020 --> 02:40:51.750
I know a few deaf people and I was asking them,
uh,

2833
02:40:51.751 --> 02:40:52.790
is,
is,

2834
02:40:52.791 --> 02:40:57.090
is sign language universal and no sign language is different in Australia than

2835
02:40:57.091 --> 02:40:58.770
it is in,
in America.

2836
02:40:58.771 --> 02:41:02.850
What did you think that sign language for deaf people would be universal.

2837
02:41:02.851 --> 02:41:05.190
Do you think the one benefit of being deaf would be?

2838
02:41:05.400 --> 02:41:09.030
You could talk to a deaf person in China or that it was all the same,

2839
02:41:09.031 --> 02:41:13.450
but they apparently there are different all over.
There's what?

2840
02:41:13.580 --> 02:41:14.700
A pen.
The deck

2841
02:41:16.880 --> 02:41:21.320
<v 0>sign language.
Uh,
what are,
what are their books?
Lock?</v>

2842
02:41:22.970 --> 02:41:26.550
<v 4>Yeah.
Did they ever have a books?
Never books.
It's just another sign.
Sorry,</v>

2843
02:41:26.551 --> 02:41:29.610
just hands together.
Just the images.
Yeah.
I wonder if that's a good,

2844
02:41:31.750 --> 02:41:32.583
<v 14>okay.</v>

2845
02:41:32.970 --> 02:41:33.510
<v 0>It's the,</v>

2846
02:41:33.510 --> 02:41:36.750
the whole idea that human beings communicate so very differently all over the

2847
02:41:36.751 --> 02:41:41.010
world.
This is very strange.
I wondered when a Google translate came out,

2848
02:41:41.011 --> 02:41:43.590
if that was really going to have a significant impact on how we understand each

2849
02:41:43.591 --> 02:41:46.290
other,
but it still is so garbled.

2850
02:41:46.370 --> 02:41:49.140
You ever like try to convert Portuguese to English?

2851
02:41:49.540 --> 02:41:50.760
<v 4>I love that.
That on the,</v>

2852
02:41:50.761 --> 02:41:54.580
on the computer that on my Mac there's that little language converter.
It's nice,

2853
02:41:54.581 --> 02:41:58.220
but it's still clunky.
You know,
it is a little clunky,

2854
02:41:58.221 --> 02:42:01.370
but I've got cousins in Argentina and my mother's from Belinda Saturdays.

2855
02:42:01.430 --> 02:42:02.030
Oh yeah.

2856
02:42:02.030 --> 02:42:05.630
And I've been down there like three times in a lot of them don't speak English

2857
02:42:05.631 --> 02:42:09.440
and I'm friends with them on Facebook and they'll send me messages that are in

2858
02:42:09.441 --> 02:42:12.090
English to little choppy,
broken English,
but cool.

2859
02:42:12.170 --> 02:42:16.520
I know they put it into the language converter and then I'll be able to write

2860
02:42:16.521 --> 02:42:20.750
him back,
you know,
a little message and,
and do the same when I was in Brazil,

2861
02:42:20.780 --> 02:42:21.920
copy paste that bad boy

2862
02:42:21.970 --> 02:42:24.850
<v 0>dudes would talk to you that way.
They want to talk to you in Brazil.</v>

2863
02:42:24.851 --> 02:42:26.050
They would have a cool translate.

2864
02:42:26.051 --> 02:42:28.810
So they would cite to cite something in Portuguese and then put it in and then

2865
02:42:28.811 --> 02:42:33.640
hold it up to genius.
Yeah,
it was amazing.
It was cool.
It's a,
it's,
that's,

2866
02:42:33.641 --> 02:42:36.040
that's the future.
It's like somewhere that is going to be like,

2867
02:42:36.041 --> 02:42:38.200
why isn't there a movie once where a guy would talk to you when a foreign

2868
02:42:38.201 --> 02:42:40.960
language and it would convert it right in front of you and your ear.

2869
02:42:41.560 --> 02:42:42.393
That's the next shit.

2870
02:42:42.490 --> 02:42:43.600
<v 4>Right.
That is the next shit.</v>

2871
02:42:43.950 --> 02:42:47.340
<v 0>Have you seen,
uh,
these,
um,
note applications on,
um,</v>

2872
02:42:47.400 --> 02:42:50.820
on iPhones where you talk into it?
No,
I don't see something crazy.

2873
02:42:50.880 --> 02:42:54.750
Let's say the shit out because this is amazing.
It's,
it's almost unbelievable.

2874
02:42:54.751 --> 02:42:57.900
It's a,
it works so quickly that it doesn't seem like it's real.

2875
02:42:58.230 --> 02:43:00.960
You press the thing,
like you want to have a thing,

2876
02:43:00.961 --> 02:43:04.080
there's a little microphone right there and I just press that and I go,

2877
02:43:04.770 --> 02:43:09.060
Tom Rhodes is a bad motherfucker.
And immediately

2878
02:43:09.630 --> 02:43:12.250
<v 4>cool.
Look at that.
That's,
it's incredible.</v>

2879
02:43:12.700 --> 02:43:16.090
<v 0>And it's,
it spells it all right.
It capitalizes your name.
Nice man.</v>

2880
02:43:16.150 --> 02:43:18.520
It's incredible.
So if you ever have any ideas,

2881
02:43:18.670 --> 02:43:21.530
you're in your car and you don't have to like pull over and write anything down.

2882
02:43:21.531 --> 02:43:24.160
You just press a button and start talking.
It's great fucking sick.

2883
02:43:24.170 --> 02:43:28.090
<v 4>It's like Michael Keaton and I'm night shift.
Yeah.
How,</v>

2884
02:43:28.100 --> 02:43:31.460
why should eliminate garbage.
How much time do you spend writing?

2885
02:43:31.490 --> 02:43:34.490
How much time do you spend like working on your act and you know,

2886
02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:38.520
I'm always adding little things.
Um,
you know,
I,

2887
02:43:38.521 --> 02:43:41.600
I just did an hour special and I just came out with a new CD.

2888
02:43:41.601 --> 02:43:45.290
So now I got to,
you know,
come up with a whole new thing.

2889
02:43:45.291 --> 02:43:47.690
So next year I'm going to do a different approach.

2890
02:43:47.691 --> 02:43:50.180

But I'm gonna,
I'm gonna,

2895
02:44:08.210 --> 02:44:11.780
I'm gonna stay in California as much as I can next year and just like a,

2896
02:44:11.781 --> 02:44:13.190

All the information will be available on [inaudible] dot com go check it out to

02:46:41.731 --> 02:46:43.380
buy supplements.
Use a codename Brogan,

2942
02:46:43.381 --> 02:46:46.530
save yourself 10% the kettle bells and battle ropes.

2943
02:46:46.560 --> 02:46:49.320
You cannot use the code name on that because we're selling them literally as

2944
02:46:49.321 --> 02:46:52.440
cheap as you can.
It's the highest quality caliber bell you can buy.

2945
02:46:52.441 --> 02:46:53.430
They're made by Troy,

2946
02:46:53.640 --> 02:46:57.270
but essentially it's very expensive to send cannon balls through the fucking

2947
02:46:57.271 --> 02:47:00.960
mail.
So I'm go get some,
go get it,
get on it.

2948
02:47:01.470 --> 02:47:03.840
Use a code name Brogan and save yourself some money.
All right,

2949
02:47:03.841 --> 02:47:06.750
somebody saved me this fucking podcast.
