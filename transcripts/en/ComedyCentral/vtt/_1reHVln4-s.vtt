00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:01.868
 - What a historic day.

00:00:01.901 --> 00:00:03.436 align:start size:88% position:13%
 So historic that
 this just can't wait.

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:05.605
 Trump sat down with
 North Korean dictator,

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:08.741 size:84% position:42%
  Kim Jong-un to take the
  first step towards peace.

00:00:08.774 --> 00:00:10.276 size:88% position:44%
 As Churchill famously said,

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.045 align:start size:88% position:13%
  the first steps
  towards peace is a

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:13.546 size:84% position:42%
  thirsty photo op.

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:15.214 line:0%
 Look at that backdrop, iconic.

00:00:15.247 --> 00:00:17.483 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
 A wall of American
 and North Korean flags

00:00:17.516 --> 00:00:18.751 line:0%
 side by side.

00:00:18.784 --> 00:00:20.787 size:88% position:44% line:0%
 A beautiful blur of
 red white and blue.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.388
You could hardly tell 'em apart.

00:00:22.421 --> 00:00:24.991
 But in this picture,
 equals, partners.

00:00:25.024 --> 00:00:26.993 align:start size:88% position:13%
 The beginning of a
 beautiful friendship.

00:00:27.026 --> 00:00:28.461 align:start size:88% position:13%
Look at them
legitimizing each other

00:00:28.494 --> 00:00:29.695 size:88% position:44%
 on the world stage.

00:00:29.728 --> 00:00:31.664 size:88% position:44%
  Like Oprah did with books.

00:00:31.697 --> 00:00:32.532
 Trump gets it.

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:33.733 size:88% position:44%
  Reality is blurry.

00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:36.702 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Kim isn't a monster,
 he's a talent.

00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:38.071 line:0%
 - [Reporter] Kim Jong-un has

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:39.272 line:0%
 killed family members,

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:41.040 size:88% position:44% line:0%
 has starved his own people,

00:00:41.073 --> 00:00:42.842 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
 why are you so
 comfortable calling

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:44.644 size:88% position:44% line:0%
  him very talented?

00:00:45.644 --> 00:00:46.879 size:88% position:44% line:0%
 - Well he is very talented,

00:00:46.912 --> 00:00:50.049 line:0%
and anybody that takes
over at 26 years of age

00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:53.152 line:0%
 and is able to run
 it and run it tough,

00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:54.887 align:start size:88% position:13%
- See? One man's
crimes against humanity

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.290 align:start size:88% position:13%
 is another man's fiery
 management style.

00:00:57.323 --> 00:00:59.125
 That's how Trump wants
 to run our country.

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:01.127
 Tough, with a whole new set of

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.029
tough, talented friends.

00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:04.530
 Just think of the
 potential photo ops.

00:01:04.563 --> 00:01:06.732
Darth Vader, he took
over pretty young, too.

00:01:06.765 --> 00:01:09.402 align:start size:88% position:13%
Sharks, sure Trump hates
them but that's just

00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:12.171
 because of their rows
 of super sharp talent.

00:01:12.204 --> 00:01:13.506
The asteroid from "Armageddon".

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:14.674
 It threatened Earth,

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:16.275 align:start size:88% position:13%
 took out Bruce Willis
 and set off the

00:01:16.308 --> 00:01:17.877
 chain of events that
 led to Ben Affleck's

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.812
 majestic back tattoo.

00:01:19.845 --> 00:01:21.781
That's frightening true talent.

00:01:21.814 --> 00:01:23.015 size:88% position:44%
  So get on board, Liberals,

00:01:23.048 --> 00:01:24.884
 this is what peace looks like.

00:01:24.917 --> 00:01:27.453 align:start size:88% position:13%
 A captured frozen
 moment with no regard

00:01:27.486 --> 00:01:28.855
for historical context.
