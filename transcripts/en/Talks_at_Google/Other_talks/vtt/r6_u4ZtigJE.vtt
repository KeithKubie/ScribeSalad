00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.080
JAMES: I just wanna say I'm absolutely a-a
massive fan of Google. I'm not just saying

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.330
because I'm here but I think when you stand
in Dragon's Den you see so many people with

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.610
lots of ideas. And, clearly, at some stage,
Google itself was an idea.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:25.200
Somebody had an idea, put the idea to practice
and I think one of the things that IÃ­ve learned

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.840
about watching organizations like Google that
it's not just about an idea.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.980
So many entrepreneurs that you meet in life
think that success lies because they woke

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.650
up in the morning sitting in the bath and
they have that Eureka Moment.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.570
That's not the moment you become the millionaire.
The concept is how do you execute an idea?

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.490
I think Google is a great example of not just
an idea but how you then execute and take

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.260
that idea to fruition.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.850
I think the thing that I've always been really
passionate about business is to execute you

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.650
need to find the right people. And certainly
for me in Dragon's Den one of the things that

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.430
I'm always very conscious of is not to get
overly excited about just the idea but while

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.719
sometimes other dragons may test the idea
where they might want to break it or overly

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:16.189
analyze it or-or get too detailed.

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:21.869
What I believe is whatever business proposition
that's offered to me- can I make it bigger,

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.149
smaller, harder, change the color? Yes, I
can.

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:32.229
But the one thing I can't change is the individual.
So when I invest, I typically overly focus

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.439
on, "Is this an individual that I believe
could be successful?" And that's really where

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.840
my kinda journey started when I first set
up my own business.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:48.149
It wasn't that I necessarily had what I think
was an amazing idea. My kinda Eureka Moment

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.289
was the concept that headhunting in the mid-80's
was only available to the elite class of this

00:01:54.289 --> 00:02:00.310
country. So only chief executives were headhunted
or the Chief Exec. of BA. And I thought, why

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.229
wouldn't you offer headhunting to the masses?

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.479
Why, why shouldn't Google hire a developer
and get a headhunter to find that person?

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.390
And in the mid-80's that didn't exist. And
that was really my idea- bring headhunting

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.380
to the masses. And I launched a company called
Alexander Mann, set up the firm and, literally,

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.290
from the word go, the first year, we took
just over a million pounds in fees and, by

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:28.340
the time I sold the company, we were doing
about a hundred and thirty million in fees.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.270
And it became quite a large brand in the UK.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:37.610
One of the key things that I learned in that
business is when you are backing people, businesses,

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.640
recruitment one of the biggest challenges
in that market is people who become really

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.640
successful.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.190
They join you two years. They get up and running.
They do really well. And next thing you know

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.050
you get a knock on the door and says, "James,I'm
now ready to leave you because I think I've

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.970
watched what you've done, you've done an amazing
job. I think I should do this myself."

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.420
So I thought this is quite a silly business
because, literally, every year you go three

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.290
steps forward and you take two steps back;
and, literally, year in, year out, the same

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.290
thing happened.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.680
And one day I woke up and thought, "I'm never
going to this into a huge business because

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.540
in people orientated businesses you'll never
hang onto these people."

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.360
And so I came up with a really crazy idea.
The next time somebody knocks on that door

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.460
with that white envelope, I'm gonna surprise
him.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:27.460
And lo and behold, of course, they did. Knock
on the door. "James, I think you're a great

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.201
guy. I love the firm. It's amazing. But it's
time for me to move on."

00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:35.340
I said, "What are you going to do?"

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.340
And they said, "I'm gonna start my own business."

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.340
I said, "Fantastic! But can I tell you something?
I'm really surprised."

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:44.890
I said, "Why did it take you so long? Because,
in my diary, I penciled you in 2 months ago

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.310
[AUDIENCE CHUCKLES] to come to this conversation.
You've obviously had to think about it more

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.870
than I did."

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.260
They said, "What do you mean?"

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:01.840
I said, "Because I've been watching you and,
as far as I'm concerned, you are absolutely

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.710
prime ready to go and do this."

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:25.990
I said, "But can I take you one step further
to when you go and set up when you run, can

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.600
I give you some advice?

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:44.480
I said, "You know Brian who works with, you
been with you for 3 years, Judy that joined

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:59.080
you about a year ago and Steve -- when you
leave, why don't you take them with you?"

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.080
[PAUSE]

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:10.750
So he is, obviously, looking a bit confused
'cause he thinks I'm now taking a piss.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:17.870
And I said, "One other thing", I said, "'cause
I'm sure it's crossed your mind."

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:27.800
I said, "I was having a quick look at your
data base and the customers that you've been

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:37.950
doing business with and what I've actually
done for you is actually taken a copy of the

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.650
data base. Here it is. Take it with you."

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:50.700
He said, "James, you know, it's taken me a
long time to prepare for this meeting. I've

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.510
been pacing up and down at home thinking,
how am I going to tell you this? And you're

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.630
not taking me seriously."

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:06.620
I said, "I think you're absolutely wrong.
I have never been more serious in all my life."

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:16.389
He said, "So let me get this right. So you
want me to leave. I'm going take all of the

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:21.210
people with me. You want me to take my customers."

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.550
I said, "Yeah, there's one more thing."

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:29.560
I said, "I've worked out roughly this is going
to cost you about a hundred forty thousand."

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:36.090
I said, "And I'd like to give you the money,
too."

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:37.400
[AUDIENCE CHUCKLES]

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.871
He said, "There's gotta be a catch."

00:06:40.871 --> 00:06:50.050
I said, "Absolutely. I want you to, I want
you to go halves with me. Let's go 50/50."

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:55.340
He said, "I don't know really. I've never
thought about that."

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.860
He said, "Do you want half the business?"

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:05.530
I said, "Sure. 'Cause if I'm going to give
you the clients, give you the staff, and I'm

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:11.510
gonna give you the money, why don't we just
go halves?"

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:15.290
He said, "You've got yourself a deal."

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:25.770
And, literally, that was my first deal, because
when you think about it, it sounds stupid.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:41.520
But I know the guy; he works for me; he's
been there three years; he's very good. Clearly,

00:07:41.520 --> 00:08:00.530
he's very good. He's now taking that big leap
of faith to say, "I'm gonna leave this corporate

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:13.330
work and I'm gonna take the risk with my own
money."

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:25.220
Which for me is really important so by walking
into me, he stepped over that line. And I'm

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:32.880
thinking you know what's gonna happen don't
you? He's gonna leave.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:46.200
What's gonna happen to the people who's been
working with him? He's gonna take 'em with

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.200
him anyway.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:09:04.920
Those clients-What-If I was him, what would
I do? I'd pick up the phone and I'd call them

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:28.800
all-"'Member me? You used to deal with me.
I'm great. I've now left. Set up on my own

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:34.680
and by the way I'm going to give you 20% discount."

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:44.790
He's going to do it anyway. The money I'm
risking. I'm matching his money.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:55.900
That was my first deal. And, literally, within
three months he got up and running and was

00:09:55.900 --> 00:10:03.060
profitable. And by month six, I got all my
money back.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:18.459
So I came up with the idea-there's lots of
people out there. Because one of the things

00:10:18.459 --> 00:10:26.110
that happens I think in the UK in the corporate
world is exactly that. The minute you have

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:41.930
an idea your first reaction is- "I've gptta
leave and do it somewhere else." So I thought

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:47.600
I need to change that principle because otherwise
my business will never grow. And I had an

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:54.330
idea that Alexander Mann was, literally, just
one company, with one location in Thomacle

00:10:54.330 --> 00:11:03.230
Road. And just like every other entrepreneur,
my ambition was I want to be global. I want

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:16.880
to be in every country around the world. But
I'd never opened a second office before. So

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:26.540
the problem is I can't do that. But there
must be somebody out there who could show

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.210
me how to do that.

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:38.190
Happened to be in America, met a guy working
for a company called MRI that had 600 offices.

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:50.330
He was the marketing director, been there
10 years. And I went to a conference where

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:59.959
he was speaking. So then I'm sitting there
and he's giving the big spiel Ã± he put this

00:11:59.959 --> 00:12:06.960
big map on the wall with all these flags,
and "We've got these 600 offices."

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:18.060
And I'm sitting there thinking, "How do you
open the second one, let alone the six hundredth

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:19.060
one?"

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:27.180
So after the conference, went up to him and
said, "Hi, I'm James Caan. I'm from London."

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:34.290
Said, "I'm really impressed with your presentation."
Said, "Can I ask you a really silly question?"

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:49.730
I said, "You've been in this firm 10 years.
Have you ever thought about doing this yourself?"

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:53.580
He says, "So you were-"

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.120
[AUDIENCE CHUCKLES]

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.350
So I said, "No. I'm being really straight."

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:14.720
I said, "You know, I run this company in London.
We'd like to expand. I'm looking for a partner

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:27.140
to really help me expand that business. Having
listened to your presentation, I think you

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.880
are that man."

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:34.160
He said, "What's the deal?"

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:47.990
I said, "Really simple. I'll put up all the
money, you run the business. If it works,

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:52.269
I'll lose. If we succeed, we'll go halves."

00:13:52.269 --> 00:13:59.430
He said, "I can't do that. You know, my family's
here. I've been here ten years. I'm on the

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:00.430
board."

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:08.540
Anyway, like any good salesman, I badgered
him to death, on the phone, every day.

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:21.839
I said, "Look, let me fly you over." Brought
him over to London. Paid for the flight. Arrived.

00:14:21.839 --> 00:14:30.880
You know sometimes you do those silly things
that just work. When he arrived in reception,

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:37.100
I'd had these business cards printed and left
them on reception.

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:38.230
[AUDIENCE CHUCKLES]

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:47.980
So a little bit of humor. He came in, I gave
him the concept and said, "You know I think

00:14:47.980 --> 00:15:02.240
you've been doing this for ten years. You're
clearly very good at it, but I think it's

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:10.720
really time where you should own a part of
what you're doing."

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:18.410
And long story short, we set up an organization,
Humana International, which was basically

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:25.279
the kind of the international brand for Alexander
Mann -- so the overseas brand. I backed him

00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:31.149
in '92, by 1997 we'd opened 147 offices in
30 countries and we sold the business. And

00:15:31.149 --> 00:15:39.040
that was the right guy. Was it the most ingenious
idea in the world? No, just got the individual

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.040
right.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:52.550
About a year into it, I get a knock on my
door. A consultant who's working for me, Rosaleen,

00:15:52.550 --> 00:16:05.630
been there six months, not particularly successful.
Ok. She comes to me and said, "James, I want

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:10.800
to have a quick chat. I've been thinking about
what I'm doing and I think that Alexander

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:15.079
Mann has got all of this wrong."

00:16:15.079 --> 00:16:24.230
So I said, "That's quite interesting, I thought
I was doing quite well, you've been here six

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:30.740
months. [AUDIENCE LAUGHS] So I said, "Have
you, have you billed anything?"

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:35.540
"What not really, but we've got it wrong."

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:46.630
"Ok, let me just-" I looked at my watch, "You've
got five minutes just give us the pitch."

00:16:46.630 --> 00:17:00.010
"Actually I think that the kind of whole concept
of recruitment is gonna change. I think today

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:12.449
this business is very much about transactions.
I think it's going to be about customer's

00:17:12.449 --> 00:17:20.610
saying, "We will essentially outsource the
entire recruitment to one organization."

00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:32.260
Now in '95, that sounded a bit kind of airy
fairy, because nobody did it. But she, for

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:40.780
some reason, when you look at her face, was
really passionate. She convinced us out, that's

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:41.780
where the market was going to go.

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:46.700
So I said, "So give me an example. What do
you mean?"

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:56.929
And she said, "Well, over the phone today
you deal with like 120 different suppliers.

00:17:56.929 --> 00:18:10.100
They go to a micro page for one thing, an
ad for another, a blue arrow for something

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:16.570
else, paste something else. Why don't we go
to them and say, 'Look we understand recruitment

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:26.840
better than anybody. Why don't you just give
it all to us?'"

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:38.200
I said, "Because Rosaleen, we can't do it.
We only deal with one area."

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:53.600
She said, "The bits we don't do, James, we
just buy from somewhere else. We'll just own

00:18:53.600 --> 00:19:01.220
the space. We'll become the gate keeper."

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:09.610
Truthfully, I thought 50/50 -- will it work,
but just listening to her, I thought, "You

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:17.320
know what, I think she will convince somebody
that this might work.

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:22.220
Anyway, so the next board meeting, I said,
"Oh by the way, I've got a little action for

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:29.390
the board meeting." I said, "I'd like to back
Rosaleen to start this outsourcing business."

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:32.540
They said, "She got any experience?"

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.429
"Uh, Not really."

00:19:34.429 --> 00:19:42.110
"How long has she been with us five years,
10 years, 12-?"

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:43.510
"Six months."

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:48.890
"Sorry -- and you want to back her to do what?"

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:55.820
I said, "Well, I think just hypothetically,
just amuse me. What happens if she's right?

00:19:55.820 --> 00:20:07.150
What happens if somebody actually hands you
a contract, a vodafone, and says. "Take the

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:10.990
lot". What would that do to us?"

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:19.930
I said, "In my view it's a service concept,
remember? We don't have to open a hundred

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:28.480
shops or buy huge cafex. There's an office
on the third floor that's empty. Let's just

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:38.720
give her the third floor. Let's give her an
office there and we'll start another business.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:47.679
It'll be really creative. Instead of Alexander
Mann, we'll call it AMS -- Alexander Mann

00:20:47.679 --> 00:20:51.190
Solutions and she can run it."

00:20:51.190 --> 00:21:02.059
Anyway, within about five minutes they all
said, "James, I think you're being ridiculous.

00:21:02.059 --> 00:21:11.740
We've gotta be focused. We know what we do.
We understand what we're good at. We don't

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:20.440
want to become all things to all people. Our
view is no."

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:31.450
One of the advantages of owning the majority
of a company, you can ignore what everybody

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:32.450
says.

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:33.450
[AUDIENCE CHUCKLES]

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:43.970
So I said, "Thanks for your advice, but I'm
gonna see Rosaleen, and I'm gonna back her

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:44.970
anyway."

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:54.410
So I've gone back to Rosaleen and I said "Look,
they thought it was an amazing idea. They're

00:21:54.410 --> 00:22:02.500
completely behind you. And we're gonna give
you the opportunity of the third. You can

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:06.550
have your own office. And we're gonna launch
this business."

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:17.559
And just as, she's utterly excited, as she's
leaving, she says, "Oh, by the way, just forgot

00:22:17.559 --> 00:22:21.620
to mention this -- I'm only going to do this
for the equity."

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:28.850
I said, "Rosaleen, you haven't made one placement
yet, you've been here six months, equity in

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:29.850
what?"

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:34.630
She says, "Well, I'm not doing it then."

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:43.680
Because she knew I'd backed a number of other
people. And obviously, this whole concept

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:48.230
is you're going to own the bit.

00:22:48.230 --> 00:23:02.570
So literally, she's at the door, I said, "I
get you love, I'll give you 10%."

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:03.820
She says, "Great, Thank you."

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:04.820
[CHUCKLE]

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:06.440
So I say, "Oh, ok."

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:16.110
And saw her the next day she says, "I'm really
excited, really motivated. I know you haven't

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:26.210
spent a lot of money, James, but I do need
you to make an investment. Because, I want

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:34.500
to be called Managing Director of my own firm,
so I want my own business accounts."

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:37.419
Said, "How much does that cost?"

00:23:37.419 --> 00:23:39.360
She said, "43 quid."

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:48.059
So I said, "Rosaleen, you're gonna have to
make that investment yourself. I've gone as

00:23:48.059 --> 00:23:53.200
far as I wanna go. You're going to have to
swim the second mile yourself."

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.250
She said, "Can I expense it?"

00:23:55.250 --> 00:24:02.510
I said, "When you make a profit, you can expense
it. But today you should pay for it."

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:14.630
Anyway, six months go by, doesn't make a sale,
banging on every door you can find.

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:25.131
Everybody thinks, "You're crazy. You want
me to hand you the entire recruitment. We

00:24:25.131 --> 00:24:30.990
don't know you from Adam. You have no track
record. You have no reference sites."

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:42.110
So at end of the six months at the board meeting,
I'm supposed to give an update. "How's your

00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:48.510
ingenious investment doing? How's she performing?
Has she sold anything?"

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:56.659
I said, "You know these things take a long
time. You've gotta be patient. This is a long

00:24:56.659 --> 00:25:06.890
game this is not about-." You know the same
spiel she gave me, I gave it back.

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:17.210
In the back of my mind I thought, "I am going
to give her five more months, because if I

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:28.500
get to the year end and she still hasn't done
a deal, now I'm looking a tad silly really.

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:35.500
Anyway, thank God, by month ten, she convinces
one company, called Fujitsu, to outsource

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:43.690
their entire recruitment, a 14,000,000 pound
contract. So, of course, now I look like a

00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:56.039
hero [CHUCKLES]. So I go out with her, sit
down with the customer. We craft the deal

00:25:56.039 --> 00:26:01.429
and they buy the concept.

00:26:01.429 --> 00:26:17.320
They said, "You know, we're a technology company
that's what we do. We understand that that's

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:29.150
your expertise. And the key issue is what
happens if you can't deliver."

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:38.380
And she was really good. She said, "Look right
now, what do you do? You go to Adica, don't

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:52.809
you? You go to Amka. Why can't I do that?
Why can't one organization manage that supply?

00:26:52.809 --> 00:27:03.500
Price it correctly. Agree the structure. Agree
the brief and I'll guarantee you that if I

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:16.830
can't fill it, I'll pay whatever the market.
But I want all the business."

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:35.270
So we got Fujitsu. She then signed up Vodaphone,
you've got Deloittes you got KPMG. At one

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:51.350
point, my revenues at Alexander Mann's were
about 90 million, her's were 270 million.

00:27:51.350 --> 00:28:02.210
When I sold, we'd peaked at 130 -- she was
at 380. So three times bigger than the business

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:09.660
that I thought I was pretty good at running.
[CHUCKLES]

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:21.320
We separated the company and I sold my business
in '99, so at a small stake to a private equity

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:28.150
firm. And we took a minority stake and we
got 25 million for that and then a few years

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:37.540
later her division got sold to Graphite Capital
for 93 million. So that little 10% actually

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:42.760
turned out to be quite a successful deal for
her and for me.

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:51.820
So I think for me the key experience, and
that was probably one of the reasons why I

00:28:51.820 --> 00:29:01.640
ended up at Dragon's Den. Because I actually
do this for a living so backing people with

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:12.480
good ideas and then working with those individuals
to grow businesses is really what I do anyway.

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:20.710
So Hamilton Bradshaw, which is my private
equity firm, we have 40 businesses that we

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:30.080
control today. Where which is outside of Dragon's
Den, which is simply where I've come across

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:41.590
somebody. And it's always that situation.
It's not that I had an idea or I was really

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:56.370
engaged with some strategy. It was literally
I met somebody, and I thought well I like

00:29:56.370 --> 00:30:10.110
this guy. I think this guy- It's always my
feelings, never about I think "the dog treadmill's

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:14.670
gonna revolutionize the world." It's the individual.

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:26.480
So even if you take Sammy- why did I invest
in Sammy. As she was making her pitch, Peter

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:36.720
and Deborah, everybody was like killing themselves
laughing, 'cause this dog's right there {CHUCKLES]and

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:43.299
knacking on the treadmill. Duncan is lying
down with Heineken in his hands. He's thinking,

00:30:43.299 --> 00:30:44.299
"What are they doing?"

00:30:44.299 --> 00:30:50.779
And I'm listening to the woman because she's
saying, "I'm a waitress during the day. In

00:30:50.779 --> 00:31:02.020
the evening, I go on the web and I sell these
treadmills." That year she'd sold 23 machines.

00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:14.549
And I said, "So tell me, Sam, what is it that's
making you do this. Why are you doing this?"

00:31:14.549 --> 00:31:23.419
She said, "I've got three kids and one my
daughters, Elizabeth, is really smart, she's

00:31:23.419 --> 00:31:30.940
really bright and I would love to send her
to private school. And right now as a waitress,

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:34.940
I'm never gonna get that kind of money. So
I've kind a started this little business on

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:38.650
my own and I think if I could sell enough
treadmills, I could get Elizabeth into private

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:39.650
school."

00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:45.440
Now to me in a way the kind of product doesn't
matter so much now, because she's driven by

00:31:45.440 --> 00:32:03.900
a goal and a focus that she so believes in,
that I think she will do whatever it takes.

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:13.730
And that was actually when I put my hand up
and said, "I'm in."

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:26.419
And of course, as soon as we came out of the
den, Peter Jones said, "James, [CHUCKLES]

00:32:26.419 --> 00:32:40.980
where's your street cred? And Theo said, "If
anybody buys one of those, I'll eat, I'll

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:44.880
eat the dog biscuit."

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:54.760
And so I called her in the next day. I've
got my team of writers together, I said, "Guys,

00:32:54.760 --> 00:33:12.170
I need your help. Let me introduce you to
Sammy, and this is Daffy the dog, and this

00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:29.970
is the treadmill." Said, "We have to find
a way somehow, because my good name is at

00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:42.580
risk because Peter and Theo are gonna track
this investment like the hawk. Because I made

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:53.740
a statement, in the den, that said, "I'm going
to make this woman really successful. So I

00:33:53.740 --> 00:34:02.480
don't care what you do I don't care if we
have to buy them ourselves, we are going to

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:06.440
sell-[CHUCKLES]-we are going to sell these
treadmills."

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:19.230
Anyway, the right guy's in the room and somebody
came up with the idea, "Why don't we sell

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:27.119
to the blind dogs association? They've got
500,000 dogs. They rehabilitate; they train

00:34:27.119 --> 00:34:33.559
the dogs -- really important. So put them
on the white board. Police force train their

00:34:33.559 --> 00:34:41.089
dogs." We put up them. The customs people
do it. All the vets. If you think naturally

00:34:41.089 --> 00:34:51.909
of that, you take your dog in; the dog could
be there for four days. That vet's gotta hire

00:34:51.909 --> 00:35:02.940
somebody and employ a dog walker four times
a day, 6 quid an hour. He's got 20 dogs that

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:10.880
he's looking after. That's actually quite
a lot of logistics, aggravation. Our pet now

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:22.729
could have the treadmill in reception. He
can be lying on his couch with his Heineken

00:35:22.729 --> 00:35:31.059
thinking about the world, while the dog's
on there doing its thing. So I'm thinking,

00:35:31.059 --> 00:35:34.369
why wouldn't we sell to vets?

00:35:34.369 --> 00:35:41.829
Anyway, year one pre-Dragon's Den, she sells
24 machines. Post-Dragon's Den with Jimmy

00:35:41.829 --> 00:35:51.239
C, 493 machines. Last year-year two-840 machines.
And ladies and gentlemen, Elizabeth is now

00:35:51.239 --> 00:35:55.279
into private school. Isn't that amazing?

00:35:55.279 --> 00:36:05.930
So to me it wasn't really the concept but
because she believed so much in her ultimate

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:17.130
goal where she wanted to be. I think all we've
done really is facilitate her that. Now I'm

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:31.719
not ashamed to tell you she has paid me all
money back and we are now making quite decent

00:36:31.719 --> 00:36:37.829
profit; so success for her and success for
us.

00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:45.920
I think what I've learned is if you are an
entrepreneur, one of the things that is quite

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:52.420
useful is your attitude becomes quite driven
because for some reason, I think entrepreneurs

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:58.510
believe they can do almost anything. Because
in business, as you know, generally if anything

00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:08.979
can go wrong, it normally does go wrong. And
one of the investments I made. Well, I was

00:37:08.979 --> 00:37:17.920
going through a couple of years where things
were just going amazingly well. Every deal

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:20.170
I did, just worked.

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:26.999
And KPMG rang me up and said they've got this
great business at Benjys. It's a sandwich

00:37:26.999 --> 00:37:41.660
chain. Of course, I'm an expert at sandwiches.
Nice strong food. I know everything about

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:50.920
that and they said, "James have I got a deal
for you. So Benjys has got like a 150 shops.

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:59.249
It's got a factory that employs 300 people.
It's quite a big brand." And, they said, "It's

00:37:59.249 --> 00:38:00.249
really cheap."

00:38:00.249 --> 00:38:11.650
So I go in on a Monday. They said the only
catch is that you've gotta make a decision

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:19.859
on Friday. Now in every lesson I've ever had
and everything I've learned about business,

00:38:19.859 --> 00:38:24.040
what do we say -- do your homework, know your
market, etc.

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:33.190
So what do I do? I go in on Monday meet the
management, Tuesday I go meet the accountants,

00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:39.869
Wednesday I meet the bank, Thursday I meet
the lawyers, Friday I buy the business. Broke

00:38:39.869 --> 00:38:43.471
every rule in the book.

00:38:43.471 --> 00:38:54.339
When I bought the business, the reason why
it was cheap, it was losing 100,000 pounds

00:38:54.339 --> 00:39:03.420
a week. So there was me every Saturday, cash
point card in, 100 grand in the business for

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:12.049
26 weeks. And so, if you can work the math,
2.6 million quid. And I tried everything.

00:39:12.049 --> 00:39:18.200
Everything I could think of to make-to turn
the business around.

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:32.039
But it was a bit like the Titanic. It takes
too long because it was too big. It wasn't

00:39:32.039 --> 00:39:48.349
A one boutique where you can go in. You might
change the brand or change the stock. But

00:39:48.349 --> 00:39:55.130
it was the factory, the logistics, the ingredients.

00:39:55.130 --> 00:40:08.520
And one of the biggest lessons that I've learned,
that I miscalculated is when youÂ¥ve got a

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:22.119
brand that has quite a strong visibility in
the market -- so let's say we're selling cheese

00:40:22.119 --> 00:40:31.390
sandwiches at 1.40. You think, "Well it's
not making any money. Why don't we just put

00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:37.849
the price up?" The problem is if I sell at
1.70, I'm not competing with Eat. Because

00:40:37.849 --> 00:40:55.900
the consumer is quite brand loyal. The consumer's
view is if I want to pay 170, I'll go to Eat;

00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:01.900
I won't go to Benjys. If it is 2 quid, I'll
go to M&amp;S. If it is 2.30, I'm a Pret customer.

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:14.089
So customers fit into prices [inaudible].
So the minute I put the price up on the cheese

00:41:14.089 --> 00:41:24.719
sandwich, we didn't sell any. Because the
next day the customer came in and said, "I'm

00:41:24.719 --> 00:41:29.250
not paying that." And people are genuinely
that sensitive.

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:35.369
So every idea I had didn't work.

00:41:35.369 --> 00:41:48.759
So come week 26, at the end of the sixth month,
I probably made the best decision I've ever

00:41:48.759 --> 00:41:57.059
made in my life, which is actually putting
my hand up and saying, "You've got this one

00:41:57.059 --> 00:42:06.880
wrong. Because If I carry on, I'm gonna go
bust. 'Cause I'll probably lose all of my

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:07.880
money."

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:26.250
I think one of the biggest issues I think
for entrepreneurship, I think even a lot of

00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:35.640
people in this room sometime will happen.
Because sometimes you get an idea, you become

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:41.990
so obsessed with it that whoever you talk
to, what do they say? "Don't give up! Carry

00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:44.530
on, carry on until you go broke."

00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:45.530
[audience chuckles]

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:49.940
And, literally, for me the smartest idea was
actually knowing when to quit. Because that

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:58.319
morning when I got up I thought, "You know
what? I can't do this. I've tried everything.

00:42:58.319 --> 00:43:13.329
It doesn't work. I have to stop hemorrhaging,
because if I go to that cash vault one more

00:43:13.329 --> 00:43:24.759
time, they're going to run out of cash at
the rate I'm going. Decided to call it a day

00:43:24.759 --> 00:43:34.430
and, literally, handed the keys back to KPMG
who I bought the business from and said, "Guys,

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:37.680
you can take it."

00:43:37.680 --> 00:44:02.119
And it was quite interesting, that having
made that decision, what a relief. Because

00:44:02.119 --> 00:44:13.349
for that period, I mean I was the most stressed
person, you can imagine.

00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:28.890
And in my head, when I decided to give the
keys back, the idea was that was it. I've

00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:34.799
lost my money, end of story, move on to the
next opportunity.

00:44:34.799 --> 00:44:38.890
And the guy at KPMG said to me, "Actually,
James, before you do that, the one thing Benjys

00:44:38.890 --> 00:44:42.289
does actually have is quite good sites. We
have Bond Street, Oxford Street, Tottenham

00:44:42.289 --> 00:44:46.489
Court Road, Bank." He said, "When we-what
we could do, before we put it into administration,

00:44:46.489 --> 00:44:47.489
we could actually sell the sites. Because
those sites Pret want those sites, Eat want

00:44:47.489 --> 00:44:56.229
those sites. So why don't we just moush all
of them and say, "We've got a site available

00:44:56.229 --> 00:44:57.229
on Bond Street -- make us an offer." So Pret
offered 30 grand. Heat offered 50 and Subway

00:44:57.229 --> 00:45:05.279
came it at 80. So of the 150 sites, 100 of
them we gave away just as they were; but 50,

00:45:05.279 --> 00:45:06.819
we got 1.7 million for. Just on premiums.
So actually sometimes it was smar- that had

00:45:06.819 --> 00:45:07.819
I had actually-

00:45:07.819 --> 00:45:18.960
So what is the moral of this story? If I had
called it quits from month four, I probably

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:20.579
would have broken even. And I think that was
the other lesson that sometimes, when something

00:45:20.579 --> 00:45:21.900
isn't working, having that ability to be strong
enough and cut your losses.

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:33.559
So if I look at SME businesses or small businesses,
one of the biggest reasons why they fail is

00:45:33.559 --> 00:45:39.089
'cause they hang on too long. Which for me
now a days, I have a very clear strategy.

00:45:39.089 --> 00:45:41.660
If it's gonna fail, please make sure it fails
quickly because procrastination is really

00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:42.660
expensive.

00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:43.660
So what do I do now?

00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:53.029
I spend essentially a third of my time at
Hamilton Bradshaw with private equity, where

00:45:53.029 --> 00:45:54.329
I look after -- I've bought plenty of businesses.

00:45:54.329 --> 00:46:08.259
I spend two days a week with Dragon's Den,
with the media, with the TV, all that kinda

00:46:08.259 --> 00:46:09.259
stuff.

00:46:09.259 --> 00:46:11.039
And probably the most interesting part of
my life now is that four years ago now I set

00:46:11.039 --> 00:46:17.880
up the James Caan Foundation and it really
started where I was just like a lot of people

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:22.759
sitting there watching TV. I saw that earthquake
in Kashmir where 3 million people just got

00:46:22.759 --> 00:46:27.030
dislodged because of the earthquake, and as
I'm watching this I'm like, genuinely, quite

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:32.619
taken aback thinking just in a split second
just imagine 3 million people just kind of

00:46:32.619 --> 00:46:34.210
lose their homes.

00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:40.009
It was a Thursday, and that night for some
reason I couldn't sleep. I was just going

00:46:40.009 --> 00:46:41.849
through my head. And I got up in the morning
and I said, "I'm actually going to go to Kashmir.

00:46:41.849 --> 00:46:42.950
I'm just gonna fly out.

00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:51.680
I wanna see, actually wanna see what happened
and how did this happen? And as I arrived,

00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:54.849
I can't even begin to explain to you, but
if you kind a closed your eyes and visualized

00:46:54.849 --> 00:46:57.670
what would the end of the world look like.
That's what Kashmir was.

00:46:57.670 --> 00:47:00.890
As you walked down the street, there were
these five story buildings that, literally,

00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:03.359
had dropped where you could see the fifth
story which had become one story. Cars literally

00:47:03.359 --> 00:47:04.779
hanging off cliff tops. People dead with arms
hanging out and things. It was just unbelievable.

00:47:04.779 --> 00:47:05.779
You could just smell death everywhere.

00:47:05.779 --> 00:47:08.420
Anyway so I'm walkin' around, and I'm completely
taken aback. I can't believe where I am. And

00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:12.120
these army people were showing me around.
And as I'm going up to the mountain top, because

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:14.809
it's quite hilly, I see all of these people
wandering around.

00:47:14.809 --> 00:47:18.849
And I say to the army guys, "What's gonna
happen to these people? 'Cause it don't seem

00:47:18.849 --> 00:47:20.089
like nobody's looking after them."

00:47:20.089 --> 00:47:23.690
He said, "To be frank, James, the flat land
is where the vast majority of the people are

00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:29.459
and that's where we're gonna concentrate.
So we're gonna get tents, etc.; but we can't

00:47:29.459 --> 00:47:32.930
get to the mountains. It's too hard, it's
too expensive, we've gotta focus on the ground."

00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:35.779
So I thought, but, Jesus, there's like hundreds
of these people. It's October, you know, it's

00:47:35.779 --> 00:47:37.009
gonna be 24 degrees minus in like a week's
time. And he's just casually said, "So they'll

00:47:37.009 --> 00:47:38.009
die."

00:47:38.009 --> 00:47:41.720
I thought, "Wow! This is -- it's just unbelievable."
Anyway so while I'm the Ã± I just decide that

00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:47.219
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna build houses
for the people on the hill tops. Because just

00:47:47.219 --> 00:47:48.609
the idea that a human being when somebody
just says to you very casually, "and they'll

00:47:48.609 --> 00:47:54.420
die", you think there must be something you
can do. And I didn't blame the government

00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:59.890
because I can understand -- there's such a
big issue that you can't do it all.

00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:02.859
So I come back to the UK bring lots of friends
of mine and I said, "Do you know anyone who's

00:48:02.859 --> 00:48:03.859
like an architect, who understands, how do
you build houses in an earthquake kind of

00:48:03.859 --> 00:48:04.859
environment?"

00:48:04.859 --> 00:48:05.859
And one of my friends knew a guy, who just
came back from the tsunami so I talked to

00:48:05.859 --> 00:48:06.859
him, spoke to him, flew him out to Pakistan.
He then actually Ã± interesting -- used Google

00:48:06.859 --> 00:48:07.859
Earth to kind of look at the area, look at
the terrain, worked out what you have to do,

00:48:07.859 --> 00:48:08.859
designed the models in the UK, we flew back
over there, we found a factory.

00:48:08.859 --> 00:48:10.410
The factory built houses. Then I have to get
the lorries to physÃ 'cause the factory was

00:48:10.410 --> 00:48:12.900
300 miles away from the location. So we got
the factory made the houses, got the transport,

00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:16.400
got 'em up to the mountains. When we got to
the mountains, we couldn't take them any higher,

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:19.779
because the roads didn't exist or they were
broken. Had to get 4x4's, so the army provided

00:48:19.779 --> 00:48:24.619
all the 4x4s. Got them so far couldn't take
them any further. We then needed mules too.

00:48:24.619 --> 00:48:28.329
I mean the point I'm making is that anything
that could've gone wrong, went wrong, because

00:48:28.329 --> 00:48:29.329
I'm trying to do it from remote control in
Grosvenor Street, Mayfair, not easy.

00:48:29.329 --> 00:48:30.329
And eventually, we decided we've got the houses,
we've 100 houses that we built. We have to

00:48:30.329 --> 00:48:31.489
fly back. It's amazing. The army said to me,
"So who do you want to give the houses to?"

00:48:31.489 --> 00:48:36.884
Really a silly question, never thought of
it. He said, "Because there's all of these

00:48:36.884 --> 00:48:37.884
people, how do you select, who gets the house."

00:48:37.884 --> 00:48:41.109
So I said, "Ok, just what have you got as
the list?" So he's going through this list

00:48:41.109 --> 00:48:42.140
which is just unbelievable where he said this
family with six kids-five sons, one daughter

00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:43.140
-- all of the sons unfortunately have died
and she only got one daughter left so she

00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:44.140
can't really fend for herself so we could
give her one of those.

00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:45.930
So a married couple, grandma, grandpa, I think
the father lost his legs because he got crushed

00:48:45.930 --> 00:48:46.930
in as a Ã± just imagine going through a situation
like that where you have to decide. I mean

00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:47.930
it was just unbelievable.

00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:48.930
And that experience of -- and you can imagine
as I've arrived and I've built the houses

00:48:48.930 --> 00:48:50.880
and given the houses to these people, just
the look on their face. I mean anything I'd

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:53.099
ever done in my life, any deal I've done or
any money I've ever made could not replace

00:48:53.099 --> 00:48:55.069
that one day of going round and giving keys
to these people and saying they're rather

00:48:55.069 --> 00:48:56.069
new.

00:48:56.069 --> 00:48:58.269
Just because Ã± and the reason they wouldn't
come down is that they felt that if they left

00:48:58.269 --> 00:48:59.269
their piece of land, somebody would take it.
This little piece of land, something that's

00:48:59.269 --> 00:49:02.529
all they own in their life and that just meant
everything to them.

00:49:02.529 --> 00:49:07.880
So that kinda taught me that actually -- entrepreneurs
we can do a lot more because there are skills

00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:11.680
that you acquire just in terms of mindset.
So because of that experience, I now do the

00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:13.540
Big Issue that I'm chairman of Big Issue and
I'm quite involved with homeless in this country;

00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:14.540
because you set there and think about it-why
should we in Britain, you know, we're quite

00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:15.540
a sophisticated race; we're quite a developed
economy -- why should people have to sleep

00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:16.540
on the streets?

00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:17.540
It's almost kind of ridiculous when you think
about it. I think what the Big Issue does

00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:18.540
is actually quite a good concept, because
what it's saying is, 'We don't want people

00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:19.540
to beg. We want to be entrepreneurs.'

00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:20.540
So homeless people come to the Big Issue every
day. We sell the magazine to them for 75 pence

00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:21.540
and they go out and sell it for a pound fifty.
And they keep all profits. So actually it

00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:22.540
is an idea I thought was a fantastic idea.
We sell [COUGH]I think a 116,000 copies a

00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:23.540
week.

00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:24.540
And my objective, and since I've become chairman,
my idea was - in 18 years, this business is

00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:25.540
actually not that profitable, I thought what
I'd like to do is in my first year, I want

00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:26.540
this business to make a 1,000,000 pound profit.

00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:27.540
So I spent a day with one of the homeless
people and said, "Show me what you do." So

00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:28.540
I literally stood in Cavendish Square with
him as he's selling his Big Issue. And entrepreneur

00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:29.540
mindset, standing there I notice that for
every four people that walk past and give

00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:30.540
him money only one of them takes the magazine.
That's interesting.

00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:31.540
So we're selling 116,000 copies a week -- that's
with three people not taking it. All I need

00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:32.540
to do is get two out of the three to take
the magazine. I've quadrupled my sales. And

00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:33.540
actually, we'll make a profit and that 1,000,000
pounds I can now support more homeless people.

00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:34.540
So just that little twist of educating the
consumer to say, "Please, by you not taking

00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:35.540
the magazine, you're turning him back into
a beggar, 'cause actually he's now begging,

00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:36.540
isn't he? Because he hasn't sold you anything."
So by changing that, phenomenal!

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:37.540
Secondly, my first board meeting I asked them
a question. "I set it for one pound fifty.

00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:38.540
There's eight people in the room. Can somebody
give me a reason why it shouldn't be one pound

00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:39.540
seventy?" So I go around the room; nobody
has a response. So I said, "I think it's decided

00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:40.540
then. It's one seventy. So, I said to the
finance guy, "116,000 a week times 20 p. is

00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:41.540
roughly how much?" It's 20 grand a week. So
20,000 times 52, bingo there's a million quid.

00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:42.540
To the finance guy, "What will it cost me?
How does my cost go up? Do I need more people?"

00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:43.540
"No." "Do I need more infrastructure?" "No."
So it's just the cost of the magazine. And

00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:44.540
how much is that -- 8 p. So actually roughly
we're going to make half a million quid.

00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:45.540
So just by doing something really simple,
the amount of money that we'll make, that

00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:46.540
extra million pounds, the impact that we'll
have to more homeless people.

00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:47.540
And that to me, I find really fascinating
where entrepreneurship can move into kind

00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:48.540
of social entrepreneurship where you can use
that expertise, because all the people I meet

00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:49.540
in kind of charitable organizations are great
because they're there because they got obsessed

00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:50.540
with the idea. But do they have what it takes,
that kind a DNA of business? Probably not.

00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:51.540
So I'm kind of applying that business concept
and ideas to different types of charitable

00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:52.540
organizations. And it's amazing that just
the simple things you can do that literally

00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:53.540
transform some of those organizations, because
they're things they haven't really thought

00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:54.540
of.

00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:55.540
So kind of two days a week, doing that. And
I must admit that side of it has probably

00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:56.540
given me more of a buzz and, and probably
more experience of business because some of

00:49:56.540 --> 00:49:57.540
the issues that I face- whether it's with
the Big Issue or with Bosnia or with Kashmir.

00:49:57.540 --> 00:49:58.540
I can actually apply a lot of that experience
in the businesses that I'm involved with.

00:49:58.540 --> 00:49:59.540
Because you're going into an organization
where you're challenged with a problem and

00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:00.540
you've got to find a way. You have to think
outside the box.

00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:01.540
So there's no reason why I think anybody in
this room couldn't apply some of the things,

00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:02.540
because giving back is not always about money.
So a lot of the stuff that I do isn't about

00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:03.540
writing a check but itÂ¥s actually using the
things that have helped me get where I am.

00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:04.540
Using your expertise, your knowledge, especially
now a days.

00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:05.540
I think technology. I mean somebody pitched
me the other day what I think is really quite

00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:06.540
an interesting idea. You go to a village in
Bombay, or in India somewhere and a lot of

00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:07.540
medication just doesn't exist because they
don't have the technology; they don't have

00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:08.540
the hospitals; they don't have all that machinery.
But telemedicine, where literally you can

00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:09.540
use a video camera to diagnose somebody. Here
-- guy's sitting in London. You've got a little

00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:10.540
shack in a village somewhere. Using technology,
you could diagnose that person actually quite

00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:11.540
accurately, just by using a phone and a camera
that enables you to show those visuals to

00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:12.540
somebody sitting in the UK.

00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:13.540
And this guy's got a data base of 470 doctors
that he's approached and said, "Would you

00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:14.540
give up 2 hours of your time every week to
sit in a room with a camera where you could

00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:15.540
advise people on the ground in these villages?"
And he's got 470 people. And he's just got

00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:16.540
this rotor where he's showing how it's done.
It's an amazing idea.

00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:17.540
And just think what does it cost? Nothing
really. How much is a camera? Mobile phones

00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:18.540
are more popular in some of those countries
than they are literally in the UK. So very

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:19.540
cheap technology. Very easily accessible.

00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:20.540
But can you imagine if you're in some remote
part of Africa, in some village and somebody's

00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:21.540
got an illness, the chance, and that's why
even something as basic as malaria is still

00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:22.540
probably in the world today -- is still the
biggest killer. And yet, for pennies, you

00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:23.540
can get a cure.

00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:24.540
So that for me, just as an entrepreneur realized.
That actually there are things that you can

00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:25.540
do. But sometimes we think that some of the
issues are so big that we can't do anything

00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:26.540
because we haven't the time or the money.

00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:27.540
But actually just a little bit of thought
process when you look at some of these issues

00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:28.540
where organizations and groups of people get
together -- literally, you can make profound

00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:29.540
changes to society that I think you'd be very
surprised at. So that kind of gives you a

00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:30.540
little bit of flavor about what that bloke
at the end who strokes his beard in Dragon's

00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:31.540
den does.

00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:32.540
But maybe, I can just open it a few minutes
for some Q&amp;A if you'd like.

00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:33.540
&gt;&gt;Can you tell us a little bit about your
home life/work life balance?

00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:34.540
&gt;&gt;JAMES: I do passionately believe in that
because I think in order to be effective you've

00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:35.540
got to be able to bring your dog to work and
I think clearly Google do that. I, I think

00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:36.540
work/life balance to me is what it means to
you. Because, I'm a bit sad because I work

00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:37.540
seven days a week, I work 18 hours a day.
I'm in the office at 7:30 and don't get home

00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:38.540
until midnight. I'm there on a Saturday, I'm
there on a Sunday. So talk me through the

00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:39.540
work/life balance.

00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:40.540
And the reason why do I do it is that I really
enjoy it.

00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:41.540
So I think everybody has a view where I kind
of work hard but then I play hard. So I do

00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:42.540
it differently. So last week I was in St.
Tropez on the boat for seven days just cruising

00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:43.540
around. So I'm back this week, back next week.

00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:44.540
Then, I'm off to Monte Carlo Ã± I'll be there
for another 10 days. So when I'm here, I'm

00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:45.540
really focused but then I take lots of breaks
because I need that, my dear. So I think that

00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:46.540
work/life balance is where you are in your
life. To some people like me the idea of maybe

00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:47.540
finishing up at 5:00 doesn't work for me.
And I think that entrepreneurs in general,

00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:48.540
I think we're all the same. I think we're
all mad. We spend too much time at work because

00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:49.540
we're driven. So I think that the entrepreneurial
community is probably quite unique because

00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:50.540
they don't have the work/life, because they
are just so obsessed with where they're going.

00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:51.540
&gt;&gt;Why charge under Â£2.00 for a copy of the
Big Issue?

00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:52.540
&gt;&gt;JAMES: Because it was my first board meeting.
In a way I was just testing to see what response

00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:53.540
I'd get and I thought 20 p. and I picked it
quite carefully I thought was almost a no

00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:54.540
brainer and I think what you do is you let
it go for six months. Because what I would

00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:55.540
then do is I wouldn't actually put it up to
2 quid but I'd put it up to 1.85 because everybody

00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:56.540
would give you 2 anyway and nobody would take
the 15 p. So I have got that thought process

00:50:56.540 --> 00:50:57.540
but I thought do it gradually.

00:50:57.540 --> 00:50:58.540
&gt;&gt; What did you learn doing your MBA that
you did not learn as an entrepreneur?

00:50:58.540 --> 00:50:59.540
&gt;&gt; JAMES: Harvard as an institution was without
a doubt -- it really was the best institution

00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:00.540
in the world. I think for me because I didn't
finish school, and I didn't take any qualifications.

00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:01.540
When I was-when I'd sold my company and I
was sitting at home watching neighbors, and-

00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:02.540
[CHUCKLES]-and I, literally, I know it sounds
really ridiculous I'd actually write my CV

00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:03.540
because I thought, "I've got to do something."
And as I'm writing my CV it says "Education".

00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:04.540
And it said, "None". Maybe that's what I should
do.

00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:05.540
I think I need to and I've got two girls and
I'm trying to lecture to them about how important

00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:06.540
education is and you need good grades, and
you've got to do well. And then I'm writing

00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:07.540
the CV and it's got blank.

00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:08.540
So I thought actually I need to go back and
maybe I suppose it was curiosity. What did

00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:09.540
I miss out. Why do all of these people become
so obsessed with their degrees? And because

00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:10.540
I had a little bit of cash at the time, I
thought if you had money where would you go?

00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:11.540
And I thought Harvard seemed like a good idea
[AUDIENCE CHUCKLES] and then I bought it.

00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:12.540
NO!

00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:13.540
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:14.540
So I did the course. And I suppose being serious
there was one bit that I thought was really

00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:15.540
clever in the way that they taught. So basically
the structure of the course was -- in the

00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:16.540
mornings you do case studies on companies.
So they say letÃ­s look at a company, it could

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:17.540
be American Express, letÃ­s go to management,
let's look at the balance sheet, the vision,

00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:18.540
the strategy, the product, etc. Kinda get
that, understand that. But in the afternoons,

00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:19.540
we did countries; so we'd say letÃ­s look
at India and the way Harvard taught which

00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:20.540
I thought was unbelievable is they taught
you about countries the same way that they

00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:21.540
teach about companies. Which as entrepreneurial
as you get straightaway. They say, ok, China

00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:22.540
whoÃ­s the management. LetÃ­s look at the
board. So letÃ­s look at the President. Who

00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:23.540
is he? WhatÃ­s his values? WhatÃ­s his views?
WhoÃ­s he got around him? Has he got a balance

00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:24.540
sheet? WhatÃ­s the kind of natural resources
of this country which is the balance sheet

00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:25.540
really? WhatÃ­s its GDP? What kind of productivity
does it? WhatÃ­s its GDP level? Who is its

00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:26.540
partners?

00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:27.540
And I kind a learned more about the global
economy in that environment because we had

00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:28.540
147 offices in 30 countries and I remember
when I was at Harvard, I was going through

00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:29.540
the list of offices that we had that I should
never have gone into. Because the truth is,

00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:30.540
I knew nothing about it.

00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:31.540
What I learned about the dynamics of those
economies because when I opened those offices

00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:32.540
it was 'cause I was looking at a map and I
was puttin' these needles with little flags

00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:33.540
in, sayin', "We need one there, we need one
there, that one looks really good." But actually

00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:34.540
half of them we didnÃ­t make any money; because
we didnÃ­t think it through carefully. And

00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:35.540
why did we do it? Because one of our competitors
were there.

00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:36.540
But actually, if I had followed what I was
taught I probably wouldnÃ­t; and I played

00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:37.540
the 80/20 rule. That 80% of my revenue came
from 20% of the offices and 80% of them didnÃ­t

00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:38.540
make any money. So I probably would have been
more effective, I think, just by being more

00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:39.540
intelligent about it. But with CSC Woodwork,
itÃ­s kind of difficult to do that, but anyway.

00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:40.540
&gt;&gt;What is the grand plan for the next ten
or twenty years?

00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:41.540
&gt;&gt;JAMES: Funny enough a gentleman asked me
that question, "Where will you be in ten years'

00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:42.540
time?" And I said, "If IÃ­m really honest,
I would love to be exactly where I am now.

00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:43.540
IÃ­m really happy where I am. I love what
I do. I actually wouldnÃ­t change anything.

00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:44.540
I think IÃ­ve got that kind of balance where
I do a bit of business, a bit of media, a

00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:45.540
bit of philanthropy. And I think that spread
really keeps me happy so if I was still doing

00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:46.540
this 20 years from now, I think that IÃ­d
be a happy man" And I know that's not what

00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:47.540
you wanna hear butÃ

00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:48.540
&gt;&gt;Do people really Ã¬freezeÃ® on DragonÃ­s
Den?

00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:49.540
&gt;&gt;JAMES: Literally, the first time we see
that person is when he walks up the stairs.

00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:50.540
And the reason for that is if you havenÃ­t
noticed the camera is always focused on our

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:51.540
faces. They want that expression, of what
your first impression of that person is. And

00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:52.540
so the guy comes into you.

00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:53.540
YouÃ­re a normal individual. You walk into
a den. Six cameras, lights everywhere. And

00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:54.540
thereÃ­s these five people sitting there staring
at you. You know what? It doesnÃ­t feel great

00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:55.540
and sometimes, IÃ­ve tried it sometimes, when
weÃ­re messing around in the den, weÃ­re waiting

00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:56.540
for the next guy to come in. One of us will
go and just take the Mickey and pitch just

00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:57.540
pitch the ridiculous pitch the guy did before.

00:51:57.540 --> 00:51:58.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:58.540 --> 00:51:59.540
Sorry, can you edit that?

00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:00.540
[LAUGHTER]So IÃ­ve stood there and actually
it feels weird. Because in

00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:01.540
a way, what you'd really like is you would
like somebody to lean on or sit on a stool.

00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:02.540
But when youÃ­re standing there itÃ­s like
where do I put my hands, and a lot of people

00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:03.540
donÃ­t have props.

00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:04.540
And, literally, you're standing there and
Deborah will come in with a question and Peter

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:05.540
will come in with a question. Of course, because
of the way the show is made we all, literally,

00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:06.540
fire questions at the same time 'cause it's
great TV. No! And I think it's hard, I think

00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:07.540
itÃ­s really difficult. And I think Ã± I have
watched literally grown men stand there and

00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:08.540
they just go silent. You know, his throat
just seizes. Forget about asking the same

00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:09.540
questions; some of them canÃ­t even get the
words out. Because it really is, genuinely,

00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:10.540
that tough.

00:52:10.540 --> 00:52:11.540
And I donÃ­t know if some of you have noted
but the cameras go on that. There was a guy

00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:12.540
in this series where heÃ­s pitching away and
heÃ­s really, really nervous and as IÃ­m looking

00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:13.540
at his face, thereÃ­s a drop there of sweat
just coming down his face and IÃ­m finding

00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:14.540
it really hard to concentrate because I can
see itÃ­s gonna drop. So I said to the guy,

00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:15.540
the camera man, "Dave, do me a favor. Can
somebody give him a tissue?" And in DaveÃ­s

00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:16.540
ear, the producer said, "No". So I thought,
'You, whatever.' Anyway since I've come out

00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:17.540
I've had a real-I said guys that was really
bad, but he said, "It made for great TV."

00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:18.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:19.540
&gt;&gt;What would you do differently if you owned
Google?

00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:20.540
&gt;&gt;JAMES: I think, actually I think as a business
model, I think clearly itÃ­s very successful,

00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:21.540
does very well. And I think in some of the
areas that it's diversified into- you see

00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:22.540
so many different products whether itÃ­s the
phone, or Google Earth, or the map, etc.

00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:23.540
To be honest, I think it probably is doing
what I would do. You're trying different markets,

00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:24.540
different products, different services. There
are clearly with the brand Ã± I mean I think

00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:25.540
the key issue to me is the brand. That brand,
because it is so generic can be almost used

00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:26.540
in so many different areas. And I think, just
I'm sure, I have no doubt, that in your kind

00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:27.540
of research and development space, there must
be 20 other ideas that are currently being

00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:28.540
explored, developed, evaluated which is what
you would do.

00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:29.540
I think that because you have that clear market
leader position, I think the only thing you

00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:30.540
have to be very sensitive about is -- DonÃ­t
ever underestimate your competition.

00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:31.540
You know, I think in every business IÃ­ve
ever been in sometimes, when I reflect back,

00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:32.540
the mistake that IÃ­ve made is IÃ­ve become
too complacent. Because when you are that

00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:33.540
successful, it's very easy to forget that
everybody else is watching you a lot closer

00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:34.540
than you're watching them. There are far more
people who study Google than Google study

00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:35.540
them.

00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:36.540
So I would just -- for me just be very sensitive
because I have seen you get knocked off your

00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:37.540
perch quicker than you think.

00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:38.540
I think if you look at Microsoft, you know
kind a lost its way a bit. And there are other

00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:39.540
organizations that at one point I mean they
were so dominant that really Google should

00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:40.540
never have existed in my opinion because Microsoft
should have. It was the natural thing for

00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:41.540
them to do, but when you look back -- how
stupid was that decision, but complacency

00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:42.540
is the same issue isnÃ­t it. You're sitting
there, you're king of the world, youÃ­ve got

00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:43.540
everything.

00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:44.540
You think you have arrived but actually everybody
else is biting away at what you're doing.

00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:45.540
And I think to me, that's always the key,
whether youÃ­re an individual or an organization,

00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:46.540
whether you're in a job there are other people
who frankly want that job more than you do.

00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:47.540
You know, youÃ­re number one. There are more
people whoÃ­d like to be in that position

00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:48.540
than the way youÃ­re looking at it. So I think
when youÃ­re that successful --

00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:49.540
ItÃ­s a bit like me when I look at myself
and say, "What is it that motivates me?" The

00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:50.540
actuality is the fear of failure. Sounds weird
but that's exactly how I feel; because you

00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:51.540
get somewhere and you think, Oh my God, what
would happen if I lost it? Because I absolutely,

00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:52.540
IÃ­m convinced that I could lose it all tomorrow,
because no business is infallible. You know

00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:53.540
if you look at some of the crazy things that
happen in this world whether itÃ­s a dust

00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:54.540
cloud or some glitch of technology or the
Chinese saying, you don't believe in what

00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:55.540
you are doing, something happens.

00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:56.540
Remember, that example where you had Ratners?
It was an amazing jewelry brand, and it was

00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:57.540
a huge business. And the guy went up just
like me. He was makin' a speech and he said,

00:52:57.540 --> 00:52:58.540
"We sell crap." And that was it. A brand that
had been around for a 100 years, had like

00:52:58.540 --> 00:52:59.540
400 shops in every single high street, multi-million
pound business and then in three months crashed

00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:00.540
because he just got it, just made the most
fatal error. Overly confident, overly arrogant,

00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:01.540
said the wrong thing, one statement and the
media just destroyed it. So to me complacency

00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:02.540
is quite key.

00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:03.540
On that note, ladies and gentlemen, Thank
you very much indeed. It has been great being

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:04.540
here. Thanks a lot.

00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:04.541
