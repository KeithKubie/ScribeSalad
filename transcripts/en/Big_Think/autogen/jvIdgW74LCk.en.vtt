course the phrase reasonable doubt comes
 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:15.289
course the phrase reasonable doubt comes
up in courts of law where juries are

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299
up in courts of law where juries are
 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.350
up in courts of law where juries are

reasonable doubt that they are guilty
and that sounds all very good it should

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849
and that sounds all very good it should
 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.569
and that sounds all very good it should
be beyond reasonable doubt but when you

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:29.579
be beyond reasonable doubt but when you
 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.249
be beyond reasonable doubt but when you
think about the fact that I'd think

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:31.259
think about the fact that I'd think
 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:32.930
think about the fact that I'd think
about courtroom dramas which is so

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940
about courtroom dramas which is so
 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.869
about courtroom dramas which is so

popular on television for example and I
and I suspect that this accurately

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:38.880
and I suspect that this accurately
 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.520
and I suspect that this accurately
portrays something like what goes on in

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530
portrays something like what goes on in
 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.230
portrays something like what goes on in
real courtrooms and I've certainly been

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:42.240
real courtrooms and I've certainly been
 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.280
real courtrooms and I've certainly been
on three juries myself there is a note

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290
on three juries myself there is a note
 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.260
on three juries myself there is a note
of suspense in the court when the jury

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270
of suspense in the court when the jury
 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.940
of suspense in the court when the jury
comes back which way will they go will

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950
comes back which way will they go will
 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.350
comes back which way will they go will

you go ahh how can that be if it's
 

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:36.169
you go ahh how can that be if it's
beyond reasonable doubt imagine the

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:36.179
beyond reasonable doubt imagine the
 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:38.449
beyond reasonable doubt imagine the
following experiment suppose that you

00:01:38.449 --> 00:01:38.459
following experiment suppose that you
 

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:42.260
following experiment suppose that you
had two juries listening to the same

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270
had two juries listening to the same
 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.769
had two juries listening to the same
evidence and the two juries not allowed

evidence and the two juries not allowed
 

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:47.269
evidence and the two juries not allowed
to talk to each other they're sent off

00:01:47.269 --> 00:01:47.279
to talk to each other they're sent off
 

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:49.879
to talk to each other they're sent off
into separate jury rooms and they come

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:49.889
into separate jury rooms and they come
 

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:52.190
into separate jury rooms and they come
up with their own separate verdicts who

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200
up with their own separate verdicts who
 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.859
up with their own separate verdicts who
would bet on the jury's coming back with

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869
would bet on the jury's coming back with
 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.870
would bet on the jury's coming back with
the same verdict every single time

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880
the same verdict every single time
 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.510
the same verdict every single time
virtually nobody would in my if you

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520
virtually nobody would in my if you
 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.129
virtually nobody would in my if you
think about the OJ Simpson trial for

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:01.139
think about the OJ Simpson trial for
 

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:02.419
think about the OJ Simpson trial for
example with anything for Tibet or

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429
example with anything for Tibet or
 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:03.859
example with anything for Tibet or
another jury coming up with the same

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869
another jury coming up with the same
 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.909
another jury coming up with the same
verdict and yet unless you can bet

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:07.919
verdict and yet unless you can bet
 

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:09.620
verdict and yet unless you can bet
unless you can say yes they would come

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630
unless you can say yes they would come
 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.360
unless you can say yes they would come
up with the same verdict you cannot

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370
up with the same verdict you cannot
 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.850
up with the same verdict you cannot
really take the phrase beyond reasonable

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860
really take the phrase beyond reasonable
 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.490
really take the phrase beyond reasonable
doubt seriously now I'm not suggesting

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500
doubt seriously now I'm not suggesting
 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.559
doubt seriously now I'm not suggesting
that we should have two juries in

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569
that we should have two juries in
 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.539
that we should have two juries in
trial I'm just pointing out that the

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549
trial I'm just pointing out that the
 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.479
trial I'm just pointing out that the
phrase beyond reasonable doubt doesn't

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489
phrase beyond reasonable doubt doesn't
 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.040
phrase beyond reasonable doubt doesn't
actually mean what it says

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050
 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.289
