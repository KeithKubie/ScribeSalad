00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:07.240
There we go, that should help my brain work
better… right?

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.530
Yo, this is DNews, I'm Trace.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.839
Athletes push their bodies to the limit, which
can come with stress, injury and pain.

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.279
To reach peak potential they listen to trainers,
coaches, nutritionists, and physical therapists

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.840
to help manage those effects.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.169
But to reach that peak, athletes sometimes
go for unconventional alternative therapies.

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.689
One of those is extremely visible: elastic
therapeutic tape.

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.180
This colorful tape is sold under various brand
names, but the original elastic therapeutic

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.640
tape was invented in the 1970s by a chiropractor
and acupuncturist named Dr. Kenzo Kase.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.090
The idea is to "alleviate discomfort and facilitate
lymphatic drainage by microscopically lifting

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.590
the skin," basically, by pulling on the skin,
the skeletal muscles, circulatory and lymphatic

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.899
systems so it has more space to… well…
muscle, circulate blood, and drain lymph.

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.790
The goal was to make people feel better, push
further, and have less pain, simply by microscopically

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.480
lifting some skin with sticky-tape.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.510
Admittedly science was skeptical -- I mean,
that is sort of, like, science's thing.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.440
Firstly, lifting the skin "microscopically"
on say, a thigh, may affect surface circulation,

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.820
but won't affect the whole tissue: I mean,
quadricep muscle volume alone can be 2400

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:17.820
cubic centimeters!

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.890
But I digress, let's look at the science.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.640
A study used by those critical of the tape
was published in Sports Medicine in 2012.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.940
They performed a meta-analysis of studies
done with elastic therapeutic tape to see

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.700
if there was evidence it fulfilled its claims.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.799
They found 97 completed studies, but only
10 with actual control groups that also looked

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.820
at musculoskeletal outcome; and none of them
had significant results for pain relief.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.869
Their conclusion?

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.310
There was "little quality evidence to support
the use of [elastic therapeutic tape] over

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.520
other types of elastic taping."10 Okay, so
this new tape ain't great for pain, and doesn't

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.439
help any more or less than regular tape.

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.189
Another study used by those who promote the
tape is titled, "The Clinical Efficacy of

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.610
Kinesio Tape for Shoulder Pain: A randomized,
Double-blinded, Clinical Trial."11 Which is…

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.320
well you can't say it's doesn't sound official!

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.190
But looking at the study you find the authors
themselves say the "physiological mechanisms

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.080
by which [the tape] is presumed to work remain
hypothetical, and we can only speculate what

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.080
they might be."

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.500
But it did seem to help their small group
(the whole sample was only 42 people; not

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.000
exactly generalizable).

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.220
It would've been larger, except participants
were weeded out "with pathology that would

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.550
be less likely to respond to the selected
taping intervention."

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.010
Does that mean "people who wouldn't look good
in the results?"

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.010
Maybe...

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.940
Look, based on the research, elastic therapeutic
tape has little generalizable quality scientific

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.650
evidence that it either does or doesn't work.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.310
Though, aside from the almost 100 studies
with no conclusive evidence… at least one

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.230
manufacturer is in a class action lawsuit
which alleges the product doesn't work as

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.230
advertised.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.010
But look, I'm not here to poop all over athletes.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.530
We're just explaining and asking why?!

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.940
If it doesn't unequivocally help with muscle
action, blood and lymph circulation, or pain…

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.520
why do athletes wear it?

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.400
Well, one reason may be that in the 2008 Beijing
games, one of the tape companies donated 50,000

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.250
rolls to 58 countries which is why it got
so popular.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.990
Another reason may be the simple placebo effect!

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:22.040
In 2011, basketballer Lamar Odom (among others)
donned hologrammed bracelets to quote, "harmonize

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.380
the body's naturally occurring bioelectric
frequencies"19 and in 2004, baseballer Joaquin

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:33.920
Benoit wore nylon strands with titanium inside,
to "enhance the body's energy management system,

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.150
increasing the capacity of every cell."

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.909
Athletics is as much a mental game as a physical.

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:43.160
The body has to be in shape, and free from
major injury, but mentally pushing yourself

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:49.680
to run 26 miles, swim 5000 meters, or ski
down a ramp to a jump 120M meters in the air…

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.940
sometimes athletes need a placebo to tell
them, 'I'm going to crush this.'

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.730
So, until we know more, more research is needed.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:13.200
What do 
you think?

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:31.500
Have you ever done anything to help get your
head ready for a game or something crazy?!
