00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.590
While today the Goodyear blimps are invariable
associated with sporting events and used for

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.750
advertising purposes, this was not always
the case.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.390
Goodyear started out in the “blimp” industry
by making the envelopes for these types of

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.390
airships.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.010
They then worked into creating the airships
themselves and were soon awarded with a government

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.080
contract to do just that.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.730
Five years after Goodyear created its first
airship, two massive rigid aircraft named

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.590
the USS Akron and the USS Macon were born.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.859
These flying wonders were created for the
US Navy and carried specialty planes like

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:42.469
the F9C-2 Curtiss Sparrowhawks, which could
be launched and retrieved during flight for

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:47.739
long range scouting and defensive purposes
as neither airships were equipped with weapons.

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.819
These massive aircraft were built with internal
metal frames, could carry and maintain up

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:57.810
to five planes while airborne, and were over
two football fields in length, weighing in

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:04.519
at a stunning 400,000 pounds (181,437 kg).

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:11.930
6.5 million cubic feet of helium was needed
to lift the monumental ships into the sky.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.570
On April 3, 1933, the Akron was sent out to
calibrate radio direction to find equipment

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.350
along the northeastern coast of the United
States.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.370
Only a few minutes after midnight, the aircraft
was hit with a series of strong winds which

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.480
caused the ship’s tail to strike water and
crash.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.450
A heartbreaking 73 lives were lost that night
with only three survivors.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.360
February 12, 1935, the Macon joined its sister
aircraft when it hit a storm and its upper

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.970
vertical fin was damaged.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.420
The blimp rapidly climbed to a dangerous altitude
of 5,000 feet, which caused the automatic

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.570
gas valves to open and release helium before
its unavoidable decent.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:53.790
The Akron crashed in the Atlantic Ocean- the
USS Macon met a similar fate, crashing into

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.790
the Pacific.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.200
Thankfully, due to the tragic loss of the
Akron two years prior, the Macon was equipped

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.140
with life-jackets and rafts which saved 81
lives and only 2 were lost.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.800
Despite the loss of the USS Akron and the
USS Macon and the declining popularity of

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.030
these types of aircraft, Goodyear continued
to design and build airships and between the

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.620
1940s and the 1950s, the company built a series
of surveillance airships for the U.S. government.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.030
These blimps were created to watch and protect
merchant ships along the coast, as well as

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.030
monitor and send early warning of an incoming
attack if present.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.999
One of history’s most historic aircraft,
the Goodyear-built ZPG-2 (The Snow Bird),

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:29.480
was among the surveillance fleet.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.319
At the time, the record for continuous flight
without landing or refueling was set at 200

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.799
hours and 26 minutes.

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:41.550
On March 4, 1957, Snow Bird took flight from
NAS South Weymouth near Boston, Massachusetts

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.400
and after an impressive eleven day voyage,
the airship landed at Naval Air Station Key

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.750
West, Florida on March 15, 1957, breaking
the previous record for continuous flight.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.909
Since then, four Goodyear blimps have crashed
due to bad weather or malfunctions, the most

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:01.159
recent accident was The Spirit of Safety which,
ironically enough, on June 12, 2011 caught

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:02.159
fire.

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.409
The Australian pilot, Mike Nerandzic, was
a hero during that crash.

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.739
The three survivors of the crash told the
media that the blimp had caught fire during

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:09.739
landing.

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.400
Once the blimp was a mere two meters off the
ground, Mike told the three passengers to

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.980
jump to safety, which they did.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.669
In his last moments, rather than attempt to
escape himself, Mike steered away the burning

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:22.260
blimp from his ground crew and was later found
dead at the controls.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.249
As to how the Goodyear blimp became inexorably
associated with sporting events, this happened

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:30.359
in 1960 when Goodyear, with the end of their
government contract for airships looming,

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:34.879
switched gears and decided to try using their
blimps as aerial platforms for cameras during

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:35.890
sporting events.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.760
This provided a service for sports coverage
outlets while simultaneously functioning as

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.180
a highly visible advertising platform for
Goodyear itself.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.930
The first such event partially filmed by cameras
aboard a Goodyear blimp was the 1960 Orange

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.329
Bowl in Miami.

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.180
Needless to say, this has worked out exceedingly
well for the company with Goodyear blimps

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.209
traveling an average of 100,000 miles per
year to various major sporting events, which

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.120
is saying something considering they travel
at an average speed of just 35 mph (about

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.199
16 km/h), though they are capable of speeds
as high as 53 mph with favorable winds and

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:14.140
the twin 210 horsepower engines at full throttle.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.880
Contrary to what you may read, the word “blimp”
did not come about from the fact that “Type

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.540
B” airships in the United States were non-rigid,
hence Type B-limp.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.670
While there were Type A and Type B class airships
in the U.S., the word “blimp” popped up

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.290
in 1916 in England, a year before the Type
B classification in the U.S.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.190
There is also no documented evidence of the
U.S. Type-B class ever being called “limp”.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.250
As to the real origin of the word “blimp”,
this is up for debate, but it’s generally

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.130
credited to British Navy officer Lt. A.D.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.130
Conningham.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.060
The story goes that he coined the word after
the noise that’s made when flicking or tapping

00:04:48.060 --> 00:05:04.949
the airship’s outer envelope.
