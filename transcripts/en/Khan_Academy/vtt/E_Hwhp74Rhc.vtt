00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.050
What we will attempt to start
to do in this video is take

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.330
the surface integral
of the function

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.910
x squared over
our surface, where

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.000
the surface in question,
the surface we're

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.580
going to care about is
going to be the unit sphere.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.200
So it could be
defined by x squared

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.917
plus y squared plus z
squared is equal to 1.

00:00:22.917 --> 00:00:25.500
And what I'm going to focus on
in this first video, because it

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.670
will take us several
videos to do it,

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.880
is just the parameterization of
this surface right over here.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.310
And as you'll see, this
is often the hardest part

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.610
because it takes a little
bit of visualization.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.840
And then after that,
it's kind of mechanical,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.950
but it can be kind of
hairy at the same time.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.560
So it's worth going through.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.974
So first, let's think about
how we can parameterize--

00:00:44.974 --> 00:00:46.640
and I have trouble
even saying the word.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.210
How we can parameterize
this unit sphere

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.240
as a function of two parameters.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.830
So let's think about it.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.570
Let's think about
it a little bit.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.240
So first, let's just think
about the unit sphere.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.100
I'm going to take a side
view of the unit sphere.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.970
So let's take the unit sphere.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.770
So this right over
here is our z-axis.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.240
That's our z-axis.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.390
And then over here,
I'm going to draw--

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.230
this is going to be not
just the x or the y-axis.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.650
This is going to be entire
xy-plane viewed from the side.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.970
That is the xy-plane.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.110
Now, our sphere,
our unit sphere,

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.150
might look something like this.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.030
The unit sphere itself is
not too hard to visualize.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.990
It might look
something like that.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.360
The radius-- let me
make it very clear.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.730
The radius at any point is 1.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.080
So this length right
over here is 1.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.670
That length right
over there is 1.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.492
And this is a sphere,
not just a circle.

00:01:47.492 --> 00:01:49.200
So I could even shade
it in a little bit,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.100
just to make it clear
that this thing has

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.460
some dimensionality to it.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.810
So that's shading it in.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.670
It kind of makes it look a
little bit more spherical.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.060
Now, let's attempt
to parameterize this.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.850
And as a first step,
let's just think.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.192
If we didn't have to think
above and below the xy-plane,

00:02:05.192 --> 00:02:07.650
if we just thought about where
this unit sphere intersected

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.432
the xy-plane, how we
could parameterize that.

00:02:10.432 --> 00:02:11.640
So let's just think about it.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.139
So where it intersects
the xy-plane.

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:16.440
It intersects it there, and
there, and actually everywhere.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.082
So it intersects it
right over there.

00:02:18.082 --> 00:02:19.790
So let's just draw
the xy-plane and think

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.210
about that intersection,
and then we

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.710
could think about
what happens as we

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.270
go above and below the xy-plane.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.270
So on the xy-plane, this little
region where we just shaded in.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.480
So let me draw.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.670
So now you could view
this as almost a top view.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.900
The z-axis is now going to be
pointing straight out at you,

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.640
straight out of the screen.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.730
So that's x.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.990
So let me draw it.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.400
So that's x, and then this
right over there is y.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.480
So this thing that we
were viewing sideways,

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.710
now we're viewing
it from the top.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.760
And so now our unit
sphere is going

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:00.052
to look something like
this viewed from above.

00:03:00.052 --> 00:03:02.260
What I just drew, this dotted
circle right over here,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.530
this is going to be where
our unit sphere intersects--

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.650
I labeled that y.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.115
That should be x.

00:03:08.115 --> 00:03:10.470
Don't want to
confuse you already.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.360
Let me clear that.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.610
So this is our x-axis.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.080
This is our x-axis.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.690
So this little
dotted blue circle,

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.700
this is where our unit sphere
intersects the xy-plane.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.860
And so using this,
we can start to think

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.220
about how to parameterize
at least our x-

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.380
and y-values, our x- and
y-coordinates, as a function

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.000
of a first parameter.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.500
So the first
parameter, we can think

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.810
of something that is-- so this
is the z-axis popping straight

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:37.724
out at us.

00:03:37.724 --> 00:03:39.640
So we're essentially,
if we're rotating around

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.310
that z-axis viewed from above,
we could imagine an angle.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.980
I will call that angle
s, which is essentially

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.560
saying how much we're
rotating from the x-axis

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.400
towards the y-axis.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.200
You could think about
it in the xy-plane

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.190
or in a plane that is
parallel to the xy-plane.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.760
Or you could say, going
around the z-axis.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.620
The z-axis popping
straight up at us.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.090
And the radius here is always 1.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.510
It's a unit sphere.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.430
So given this
parameter s, what would

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.730
be your x- and y-coordinates?

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.271
And now we're thinking
about it right

00:04:13.271 --> 00:04:15.050
if we're sitting
in the xy-plane.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.149
Well, the x-coordinate--
this goes back

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:20.089
to the unit circle definition
of our trig functions.

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:23.050
The x-coordinate is
going to be cosine of s.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.730
It would be the radius, which
is 1, times the cosine of s.

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.520
And the y-coordinate would
be 1 times the sine of s.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.390
That's actually where we get our
definitions for cosine and sine

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.225
from.

00:04:34.225 --> 00:04:35.600
So that's pretty
straightforward.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.320
And in this case, z is
obviously equal to 0.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.990
So if we wanted to add our
z-coordinate here, z is 0.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.685
We are sitting in the xy-plane.

00:04:45.685 --> 00:04:47.310
But now, let's think
about what happens

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.660
if we go above and
below the xy-plane.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.790
Remember, this is
in any plane that

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.140
is parallel to the xy-plane.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.140
This is saying how we are
rotated around the z-axis.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.790
Now, let's think about if
we go above and below it.

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.360
And to figure out how
far above or below it,

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.850
I'm going to introduce
another parameter.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.170
And this new parameter I'm
going to introduce is t.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:13.000
t is how much we've rotated
above and below the xy-plane.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.441
Now, what's
interesting about that

00:05:14.441 --> 00:05:16.690
is if we take any other cross
section that is parallel

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.290
to the xy-plane now, we are
going to have a smaller radius.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.690
Let me make that clear.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:29.250
So if we're right over there,
now where this plane intersects

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.950
our unit sphere, the
radius is smaller.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.980
The radius is smaller
than it was before.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.680
Well, what would
be this new radius?

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.870
Well, a little bit
of trigonometry.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:46.640
It's the same as this
length right over here,

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:52.190
which is going to
be cosine of t.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.480
So the radius is going
to be cosine of t.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.270
And it still works
over here because if t

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.040
goes all the way to
0, cosine of 0 is 1.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.550
And then that works
right over there

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.520
when we're in the xy-plane.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.150
So the radius over here
is going to be-- so

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.920
that right over
there is cosine of 0.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.820
So this is when t is equal to 0.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.020
And we haven't rotated
above or below the xy-plane.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.200
But if we have rotated
above the xy-plane,

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.320
the radius has changed.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.120
It is now cosine of t.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:29.512
And now we can use that to truly
parameterize x and y anywhere.

00:06:29.512 --> 00:06:31.220
So now, let's look at
this cross section.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.030
So we're not necessarily
in the xy-plane,

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.280
we're in something that's
parallel to the xy-plane.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.880
And so if we're up here,
now all of a sudden,

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.450
the cross section-- if
we view it from above,

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.060
might look something like this.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.060
It might look
something like this.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.030
We're viewing it from
above, this cross section

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:52.110
right over here.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:59.490
Our radius right over
here is cosine of t.

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.800
And so given that--
I guess altitude

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.190
that we're at, what would now
be the parameterization using s

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:06.440
of x and y?

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.250
Well, it's the exact same
thing, except now our radius

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:11.470
isn't a fixed 1.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.320
It is now a function of t.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.050
So we're now a
little bit higher.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:19.450
So now, our
x-coordinate is going

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:24.550
to be our radius,
which is cosine of t.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:25.950
That's just our radius.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:30.050
Times cosine of s.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.620
Times cosine of s, how
much we've angled around.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:39.420
And in this case, s has gone
all the way around here.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.190
S has gone all the
way around there,

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:44.940
so it's going to be cosine
of t times cosine of s.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.780
And then, our
y-coordinate is going

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:50.860
to be our radius, which is
cosine of t times sine of s.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.740
Same exact logic here, except
now we have a different radius.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.620
Our radius is no longer 1.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.570
Times sine of s.

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.560
I'm running out of space,
let me scroll to the right

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.049
a little bit.

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:04.590
And I know this
looks very confusing,

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:06.900
but you just have to say,
at any given level we are,

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.440
we're parallel to the x-axis.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.540
We're kind of tracing
out another circle where

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.960
another plane intersects
our unit sphere.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.600
We're now then
rotating around with s.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.080
And so our radius will change.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.440
It's a function of how
much above and below

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.692
we've rotated-- how much
above or below the xy-plane

00:08:22.692 --> 00:08:23.275
we've rotated.

00:08:23.275 --> 00:08:25.290
So this is just our
radius instead of 1.

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:28.740
And then, s is how much we've
rotated around the z-axis.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.404
Same there for the y-coordinate.

00:08:30.404 --> 00:08:32.570
And then the z-coordinate
is pretty straightforward.

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.817
It's going to be
completely a function of t.

00:08:34.817 --> 00:08:37.150
It's not dependent on how
much we've rotated around here

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.480
at any given altitude.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.570
It is what our
altitude actually is.

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:44.150
Now, we can go straight to
this diagram right over here.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:48.750
Our z-coordinate is just
going to be the sine of t.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:53.290
So our z is equal to sine of t.

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:54.490
So let me write that down.

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:59.530
So the z is going to
be equal to sine of t.

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:03.130
So now, every point
on this sphere

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:07.389
can be described as a
function of t and s.

00:09:07.389 --> 00:09:09.180
Now, we have to think
about over what range

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:10.570
will they be defined.

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:13.770
Well, s is going to go-- at any
given level, you could think.

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:16.304
For any given t, s is going
to go all the way around.

00:09:16.304 --> 00:09:17.470
We see that right over here.

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:19.011
At any given level
viewed from above,

00:09:19.011 --> 00:09:20.870
s is going to go
all the way around.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:22.750
So thinking about
in radians, s is

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:26.680
going to be between 0 and 2 pi.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:30.490
And t is essentially our
altitude in the z-direction.

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:32.160
So t can go all
the way down here,

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.410
which would be
negative pi over 2.

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:37.950
So t can be between
negative pi over 2.

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:40.610
And it can go all the
way up to pi over 2.

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:42.860
It doesn't need to go all
the way back down again.

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:47.290
And so it goes all the way
back-- it goes only up to pi

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:48.040
over 2.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.502
And then we have our
parameterization.

00:09:50.502 --> 00:09:52.210
Let me write this down
in a form that you

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:53.660
might recognize even more.

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:58.250
If we wanted to write our
surface as a position vector

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:01.110
function, we could
write it like this.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:06.250
We could write it r is
a function of s and t,

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:09.330
and it is equal to
our x-component.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:19.250
Our i-component is going to
be cosine of t cosine of s i.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:28.820
And then plus our y-component
is cosine of t sine of s

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:32.190
plus our z-component,
which is the sine-- which

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:35.850
is just-- oh, I
forgot our j vector.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:46.670
j plus the z-component, which
is just sine of t sine k.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:47.660
And we're done.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:51.040
And these are the ranges that
those parameters will take on.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.290
So that's just the first step.

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:54.880
We've parameterized
this surface.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.630
Now we're going to
have to actually set up

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:57.480
the surface integral.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.900
It's going to involve
a little bit of taking

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.800
a cross product,
which can get hairy,

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.007
and then we can actually
evaluate the integral itself.
