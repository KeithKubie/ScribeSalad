This episode is supported by hims

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.160
The term "Blue Balls" discribes

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.080
the physical and mental frustration

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.560
from prolonged period of sexual arousal

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.640
without an orgasm

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.540
But is it even real and if so

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.960
what actually happens?

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.395
Whenever you're sexually aroused

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.400
your body experiences a lot of physiological changes

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.460
In men the arteries of the penis and testicles dilate

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.920
meaning more oxygenated blood flow through them

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.700
At the same time veins constrict preventing

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.520
deoxygenated blood from leaving

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.820
This increases blood flow

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.960
and pressure results inner erection

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.815
But what you may not realised is that

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.280
testicles expand up to twice their regular size

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.580
Yep, that's right

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.440
The balls grow

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.280
Now a common misconception is that

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.240
deoxygenated blood is blue

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.800
but it's actually dark red colour

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.320
Veins often appear greenish-blue on your arms

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.520
due to the skin above them

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.700
because red light has a longer wave length

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.615
than blue light

00:00:51.615 --> 00:00:54.635
and as a result can be absorbed deeper into the skin

00:00:54.635 --> 00:00:55.900
Blue light on the other hand

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.660
ends up beeing reflected before it's absorbed

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.340
by deeper veins making a blood appear blue

00:01:00.485 --> 00:01:01.680
When it comes to your balls

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.525
since more red light is being absorbed

00:01:03.525 --> 00:01:05.360
the veins here can appear blue as well

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.420
and if arousal is prolonged

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.240
the deoxygenated blood builds up in the testicles

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.080
creating more of the blue tint

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.700
But it's not just a condition that men experience

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.955
As blood rushes to vagina during sexual arousal too

00:01:17.955 --> 00:01:19.940
the increased blood flow to the vagina wall

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:20.855
clitoris and labia

00:01:20.855 --> 00:01:22.800
results in an analogous conditions

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.985
sometimes called "Blue Vulva"

00:01:23.985 --> 00:01:25.180
The good news is

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.945
that a relief can be right around the corner

00:01:26.945 --> 00:01:29.975
It can be easily alleviated through an orgasm or

00:01:29.975 --> 00:01:31.760
by just decreasing sexual arousal

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.020
with no lasting side effects or damage

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.760
It's also been suggested that applying

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.760
an ice pack can relieve some pain

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.000
if you wanna go that road

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.980
Essentially blue balls and blue vulva

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:41.980
can happen to all of us

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.420
It's a legitimite physiological response

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.340
from prolonged sexual arousal

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.000
However it's easy to turn off

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.980
this unusual colour by getting a mind out of the gutter

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.200
or just mastubating

00:01:52.965 --> 00:01:55.705
