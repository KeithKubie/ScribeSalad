00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.649
That feeling when you meet a new dog and it's
all like and I’m all YAAAAAS LOVE MEEEE!

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:11.820
Is that gross?

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.830
Greetings canine connoisseurs, dog devotees,
puppy pundits!!

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.180
Okay, I'll stop.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.119
I'm Julian, this is DNews.

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.119
Welcome.

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.900
Although cats are the most popular pet in
the US, outnumbering dogs by around 8 million,

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.779
there are about 12 million more households
with dogs-- presumably because crazy cat ladies.

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.910
At least one DNews episode shows that humans
who live with animals are affected by the

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.329
animal's microbiome.

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.740
But what about when those pups try and lick
your face?

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.740
GROSS.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.019
Or, is it?

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:41.359
What exactly should I be feeling?

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:42.690
I'm so conflicted.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.010
First, there is a myth out there that dog’s
mouths are cleaner than a human's.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.010
This is not true.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.579
Both humans and dogs mouths contain bacteria,
lots of it.

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.950
And there's really no way to directly compare,
because while they are both mouths, they're

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.929
completely different environments!

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:01.510
Studies of the bacteria of dogs mouths have
found hundreds of species of bacteria, with

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.960
"significant" differences to human mouths.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.200
Only 16 percent of dog oral microbiota overlaps
with humans.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.840
Another study in the Archives of Oral Biology,
says there are definitely harmful pathogens

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.240
in your pup's face-hole!

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.689
A separate study in PlosOne from 2015, found
that oral-to-oral transfers of bacteria from

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:23.409
dogs to owners can cause gingivitis and periodontal
disease!

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.909
P. gulae, for example, can cause inflamed
gums and even tooth loss...it’s super rare

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.300
in humans, but common in dogs, and 16 percent
of owners had it!

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.710
There's even some bacteria in dogs mouths
which are antibiotic resistant, meaning if

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.820
it were to spread to humans, we would have
trouble treating it.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.200
On top of all THAT, if you have a cut in your
mouth, or some bleeding gums from basic gingivitis,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.850
bacteria from your dog’s tongue could enter
that open wound, and spread infections deeper

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.939
into your body.

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:53.700
We do have some natural defenses, though.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.500
Both human and dog saliva have antibacterial
properties.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.200
They're basic, but play a part in wound-licking.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.609
That DOESN'T mean you should let your pet
lick your wound though.

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:07.450
*Case studies have found infections from another
mouth bacteria in animals called Pasteurella

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.539
can result.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.989
A pasteurella infection can be treated with
antibiotics, but can also be dangerous as

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.440
it opens the way for more serious infections.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.550
So, the thing is, yes, face licking can be
gross… but there's not actually a ton of

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.450
danger from infectious bacteria.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.550
They ARE there, so being skeezed-out at the
idea of swapping saliva with a dog is probably

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.550
warranted.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.030
But sources are quick to say, both mouths
contain tons of bacteria.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.950
Plus, PET LOVERS: INFECTION GOES BOTH WAYS.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.569
You don't want to infect your dog with YOUR
dirty mouth do you?!

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.400
To be honest, you're more likely to catch
an infection by swapping saliva with another

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.980
human than with a dog, but just to be safe…
you know… the more you know the better.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.950
You do you, but think about where you put
your mouth, and if you're a kid or elderly,

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.530
you're even more susceptible to infection.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.470
In the end the Centers for Disease Control
recommends anytime you ever come in contact

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.040
with any dog you wash your hands afterward.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.190
Maybe splash a little soapy water on your
face if you’re getting puppy kisses too.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.520
