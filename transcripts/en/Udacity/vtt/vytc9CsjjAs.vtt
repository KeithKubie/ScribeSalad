00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.260
Alright. So, what do you think?

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.390
&gt;&gt; Well I'm actually pulling out a piece of paper

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.860
&gt;&gt; To measure things on the screen?

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.600
&gt;&gt; You know, because my screen is actually flat on the ground or

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.220
flat on the table. So, it looks like e and f are closest.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.460
&gt;&gt; Yeah, though I think we probably should

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.670
be willing to accept ef, df, or bg.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:20.830
&gt;&gt; No.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:21.985
&gt;&gt; Because they're all really similar.

00:00:21.985 --> 00:00:23.520
&gt;&gt; E and f is close, b and g is

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.830
close. But d and f is actually pretty, is clearly

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.430
farther than the rest of them. Proved by.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.640
&gt;&gt; D and. Really? because it looks like an equilateral triangle to me.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.880
&gt;&gt; Maybe it is, actually. I take it

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.540
all back. Yeah, actually you're right. You're right.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.080
It's the angle. Well actually d and f I think are closer than e and f.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.790
&gt;&gt; Alright. Good! So that yeah. So the, so the, I would

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.940
say that any of those, any of those would be fine next.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.430
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. And, I think interestingly won't change the answer, in the end.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.380
&gt;&gt; In the end. Yeah. So let's let's continue

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.780
with this process now that the quiz explanation is done.
