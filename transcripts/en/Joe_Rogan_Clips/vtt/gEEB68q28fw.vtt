00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.060
Now when you have these considerations,
when you take these actions,

2
00:00:03.061 --> 00:00:08.061
do you consult with psychologists or sociologists or historians or people that

3
00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:10.110
try to put in perspective for you?

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.110
What the ramifications of each individual move would be?

5
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.480
<v 1>I try to read as much as possible.
I tried to talk to as many people as possible.</v>

6
00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:19.610
Just get completely different perspective.
And

7
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.630
<v 0>is there any internal disagreement about actions that you take?</v>

8
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.400
<v 1>Oh yeah,
there's,
there's always,
there's always debate,
there's always debate.</v>

9
00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:31.020
But I think my role is to ask,
ask questions and make sure like are like what,

10
00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:35.580
what is our goal here?
What are we trying to do?
Um,
you know,

11
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.770
and that evolves that'll,
that evolves,

12
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.450
that evolves like [inaudible] is this over the long term going to be a net

13
00:00:42.451 --> 00:00:46.830
positive for all humans,
all,
all humanity.

14
00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:50.190
Like how do we balance the considerations of,
of,
you know,

15
00:00:50.191 --> 00:00:53.700
how we serve everyone and like how do we get down to something,

16
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.790
how do we get down to a fundamental answer in the central answer?

17
00:00:56.791 --> 00:00:59.790
And that to me is where the real truth is,

18
00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:04.060
is when you can get to something foundational.
But I like,
you know,

19
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.100
I like having conversations with as many people from as many different fields as

20
00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:12.600
possible and getting their perspective on it.
So I ask questions all the time.

21
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.670
<v 0>It's interesting the way you're phrasing this too,
that you,</v>

22
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.270
you are looking at this as a method to save or to her to help people,

23
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.380
to serve people.

24
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.700
You're looking at this as a way that you can benefit society,

25
00:01:27.701 --> 00:01:29.710
the society can benefit from your platform,

26
00:01:29.711 --> 00:01:33.760
can benefit from this disability to communicate.
Um,

27
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.480
you're not just looking at it as a tech company that has to remain profitable

28
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.700
and is one of the more interesting things about tech companies to me.

29
00:01:42.701 --> 00:01:44.140
I mean,
there's been a lot of criticism,

30
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.040
maybe justified in some ways the tech companies all lean left.

31
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.400
But what is it interesting to me is that w name another corporation that

32
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.730
willingly of its own choice takes that into consideration that they,

33
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.670
they want to serve the world and surf culture in a beneficial way regardless of

34
00:02:08.591 --> 00:02:12.940
profit.
Yeah.
I mean,
because you're not really selling anything,
right?

35
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.560
You guys have a platform,
obviously it's financially viable,
but you're not,

36
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.360
you're not selling things.

37
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.740
<v 1>Well.
I mean,
we,
we,
we,</v>

38
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.360
we do our models based off people's attention and they're paying us with our

39
00:02:26.361 --> 00:02:31.361
attention and that's extremely valuable and something that we need to really,

40
00:02:32.331 --> 00:02:37.100
really honor.
Um,
but I agree with you.
I mean like,
look at,
look at Tesla,

41
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.800
you know,
there,
you know,
I'd,
I just listened to,
uh,
um,
uh,
the,
the,

42
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.590
the recent earnings call on,
one of the things that you on said was,
look,

43
00:02:45.591 --> 00:02:48.140
there are two reasons,
uh,
for a Tesla.

44
00:02:48.141 --> 00:02:52.880
Number one is to advance,
um,
uh,

45
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.700
you know,
different sources of,

46
00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.750
of energy and more renewable sources of energy because it's a fundamental and

47
00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:03.340
existential crisis that's facing all humanity.

48
00:03:03.341 --> 00:03:08.341
And number two is to advance autonomy because it'll save lives and give people

49
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:10.380
time back.
And,
you know,

50
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.130
then you started talking about how to make that possible.
And that's where,

51
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.300
you know,
our business comes in.
How do we,
how do we make that possible?

52
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:23.140
And we,
we have,
uh,
we have a great business.
We,

53
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.580
we need to improve all bunch of it.
But we,
it,

54
00:03:27.581 --> 00:03:30.160
it serves what we think our larger purposes,

55
00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:31.930
which is serving the public conversation.

56
00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:35.560
We want to see more global public conversations.
We want to,

57
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.970
we want our technology to be used to make the world feel a lot smaller,

58
00:03:39.971 --> 00:03:44.860
to help see what common problems we have before us.
And ideally,

59
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:45.671
uh,
you know,

60
00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:49.150
how we can get people together to solve them faster and solve them better.

61
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.760
<v 0>You also seem to be embracing this responsibility that you're,</v>

62
00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.740
you're helping to evolve culture and this is part of the PR providing this

63
00:03:57.741 --> 00:04:00.050
method of communication,
of communication.

64
00:04:00.051 --> 00:04:03.710
Rather it's helping to evolve culture.
And this is,
uh,

65
00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.490
this is something that is really only applicable to tech companies in some

66
00:04:10.581 --> 00:04:11.414
strange way.

67
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.890
And it's weird that so many of them have share this.

68
00:04:15.891 --> 00:04:20.870
Like I was personally a little weirded out when Google took out.

69
00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.550
Don't be evil.
Like that was a big part of their operating model.
Take that out.

70
00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.660
Yes,
yes.
Right.
Make sure that I don't wanna get sued.

71
00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.980
I'm pretty sure they remove that from,
what would you call that?
There,

72
00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.540
there are operational directive,

73
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.810
like what is was in the code of conduct,
code of conduct.

74
00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.490
And it's not there anymore.
Right?

75
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.790
They're moving to article that says they removed the clause.

76
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.850
And this is kind of a weird thing to tell people not to be evil is where did it

77
00:04:51.981 --> 00:04:56.720
take it out once you've already said it,
it's way weirder to say af fuck it,

78
00:04:56.721 --> 00:04:57.320
we were wrong.

79
00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.860
There's another way of saying that they changed it to do the right thing.
Yeah.

80
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.870
Oh well what does that mean?

81
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.010
The fuck does do the right thing mean do the right things so you can make more

82
00:05:07.011 --> 00:05:10.640
money.
You know,
like,
Hey,
we're gonna make money.
We'll do the right thing.

83
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:11.810
It makes more money.

84
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.370
<v 1>I mean that's,
I mean that's,
that's why like,</v>

85
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.800
that's why this openness is so critical.
I mean,
that's,

86
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.500
that's why I liked the public comment to me that public conversation is so

87
00:05:19.501 --> 00:05:23.610
important is we can talk about stuff like that and like there'll be companies

88
00:05:23.611 --> 00:05:26.280
forming today that look at,
um,

89
00:05:26.281 --> 00:05:30.530
objectives and mandates like that and base their whole,
um,

90
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.540
culture around it.
And is that the right idea?
I don't know,

91
00:05:33.541 --> 00:05:36.360
but if we're not talking about it,
we won't be able to answer that question.
