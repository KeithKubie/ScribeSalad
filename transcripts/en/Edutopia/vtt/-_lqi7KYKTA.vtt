00:00:09.116 --> 00:00:10.966
&gt;&gt;Tanya: The ways in which
a multi-tiered system

00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:13.356
of support is put to
work in a middle school

00:00:13.356 --> 00:00:15.876
or a high school program
looks a little different

00:00:15.876 --> 00:00:16.926
than elementary.

00:00:17.376 --> 00:00:20.316
&gt;&gt;Ashley: There's not always
as much of a delineation

00:00:20.316 --> 00:00:22.826
between tier two and tier
three once you hit secondary,

00:00:23.176 --> 00:00:26.786
because the students are taking
so many different classes

00:00:27.216 --> 00:00:30.576
and content really
becomes number one.

00:00:31.306 --> 00:00:32.526
&gt;&gt;Tanya: Unlike elementary,

00:00:32.526 --> 00:00:35.386
where you can pull a small
group out, that's not always

00:00:35.386 --> 00:00:38.046
so in high school, because if
you pull a small group out,

00:00:38.046 --> 00:00:39.296
they might be missing content.

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:42.506
&gt;&gt;Lynda: So for some students,
it's as simple as providing time

00:00:42.506 --> 00:00:44.546
and opportunity to go
meet with the teacher

00:00:44.546 --> 00:00:46.216
after school for
additional help.

00:00:46.636 --> 00:00:50.436
In some courses, it means our
learning community leaders

00:00:50.436 --> 00:00:54.966
who have expertise in special
education, in school psychology,

00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:59.306
in reading education, are
pushing into some courses

00:00:59.436 --> 00:01:01.356
where there is a
cohort of students

00:01:01.356 --> 00:01:03.576
that needs a little
additional support.

00:01:06.586 --> 00:01:08.596
&gt;&gt;Tanya: Well, in period
one, I might be in chemistry,

00:01:08.596 --> 00:01:12.826
in period two, anatomy and
physiology, period three,

00:01:12.826 --> 00:01:14.486
would be tenth grade English.

00:01:17.646 --> 00:01:20.516
And I'm providing tier two
along with the teacher.

00:01:21.286 --> 00:01:26.246
A lot of push in is built around
helping them with life skills,

00:01:26.656 --> 00:01:31.196
organizational skills, study
skills and academic functioning,

00:01:31.196 --> 00:01:32.416
giving them strategies

00:01:32.416 --> 00:01:34.636
that maybe help them
break down the material.

00:01:35.396 --> 00:01:36.756
&gt;&gt;Yeah, so you see
how he's starting here

00:01:36.756 --> 00:01:38.036
and then he goes there.

00:01:38.036 --> 00:01:39.436
&gt;&gt;Student: Well, it's
two separate flashbacks.

00:01:39.436 --> 00:01:39.756
&gt;&gt;Tanya: Correct, yes.

00:01:39.756 --> 00:01:41.116
&gt;&gt;Student: It's a
flashback to the call

00:01:41.116 --> 00:01:42.516
and a flashback to
his childhood.

00:01:43.176 --> 00:01:47.706
&gt;&gt;Tanya: And so essentially, I
go back to school, taking notes.

00:01:47.706 --> 00:01:50.246
I'm working with the students,
I know what they're covering.

00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:53.606
If I'm living it every day,
I have a really good idea

00:01:53.846 --> 00:01:57.446
of who's doing what and then
fostering relationships.

00:01:57.536 --> 00:02:00.586
So then it's kind of like,
word of mouth advertising.

00:02:00.826 --> 00:02:03.886
If I develop relationships with
my students, they're like, "Oh,

00:02:03.886 --> 00:02:04.966
you got to see Doctor Kort.

00:02:05.196 --> 00:02:06.786
She helped me with
that senior project,

00:02:06.786 --> 00:02:07.616
you've got to go see her."

00:02:07.916 --> 00:02:12.796
You see, and so that's
how you get buy in.

00:02:15.726 --> 00:02:18.346
&gt;&gt;Ashley: School gets out
at two-oh-five for secondary

00:02:18.656 --> 00:02:21.926
and then you have from
two-ten until three

00:02:22.286 --> 00:02:24.106
to go receive tier
three instruction

00:02:24.106 --> 00:02:25.996
from a learning community
leader, a more on a one

00:02:25.996 --> 00:02:28.166
on one basis, or
tier two instruction

00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:29.566
from their classroom teacher.

00:02:29.976 --> 00:02:31.516
That's what's known
as help sessions.

00:02:32.416 --> 00:02:34.086
&gt;&gt;Tanya: Tenth grade is
on Tuesday after school.

00:02:34.086 --> 00:02:36.316
Eleventh grade is on
Thursday after school.

00:02:36.316 --> 00:02:38.936
And the twelfth grade
team treats their students

00:02:38.936 --> 00:02:40.196
like they're in college already,

00:02:40.466 --> 00:02:42.256
so they're making
office appointments

00:02:42.256 --> 00:02:43.986
or they have established
office hours.

00:02:46.076 --> 00:02:50.206
At tenth grade, we have
what's called a comprehensive

00:02:51.486 --> 00:02:52.956
help session.

00:02:53.046 --> 00:02:53.846
&gt;&gt;Lynda: All of the core
teachers come together

00:02:54.056 --> 00:02:56.026
in the same room and it's
kind of a one stop shop.

00:02:56.906 --> 00:03:00.146
&gt;&gt;Tanya: I can see some
students came here and they had

00:03:00.146 --> 00:03:02.446
to finish maybe something
for anatomy and physiology,

00:03:02.696 --> 00:03:05.406
and they moved over into
doing something for English,

00:03:05.606 --> 00:03:07.916
or they moved over and they did
something for world history.

00:03:08.756 --> 00:03:11.266
Sometimes they like to come
with their friends and then they

00:03:11.306 --> 00:03:12.346
like to work together.

00:03:12.576 --> 00:03:13.986
Then they want to
finish things up,

00:03:13.986 --> 00:03:15.376
they want to ask us questions,

00:03:15.426 --> 00:03:17.136
need clarification,
they need help.

00:03:17.596 --> 00:03:20.346
&gt;&gt;Lynda: It is becoming a part
of the culture of this school,

00:03:20.436 --> 00:03:23.136
which is really exciting,
that kids see the need

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:26.876
and opportunity to go to
their teachers after school

00:03:26.876 --> 00:03:28.346
to get additional support.

00:03:30.226 --> 00:03:32.166
&gt;&gt;Luke: You get the help
you need specifically

00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:33.166
from each teacher.

00:03:33.166 --> 00:03:35.616
&gt;&gt;Emily: I get help a
lot from Doctor Kort.

00:03:36.056 --> 00:03:38.706
&gt;&gt;Joshua: Normally, I don't
have enough time in class

00:03:38.786 --> 00:03:43.576
to do my homework and get really
all this lesson into my head.

00:03:43.826 --> 00:03:45.866
&gt;&gt;Emily: Every test
that she's helped me on,

00:03:46.006 --> 00:03:47.226
I've had a hundred on.

00:03:49.226 --> 00:03:50.036
&gt;&gt;Tanya: Welcome, everybody.

00:03:50.966 --> 00:03:53.756
&gt;&gt;Ashley: We meet as a
student success team every four

00:03:53.756 --> 00:03:54.416
and a half weeks.

00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:56.506
We meet as grade level teams.

00:03:56.976 --> 00:03:59.806
The MTSS specialist, the
learning community leader,

00:04:00.136 --> 00:04:03.286
the core teachers, the guidance
counselor come to the table

00:04:03.286 --> 00:04:05.286
and we talk through
what kids need.

00:04:05.566 --> 00:04:08.326
&gt;&gt;Tanya: Yokoa actually
showed up on several

00:04:08.326 --> 00:04:10.196
of your lists about concerns.

00:04:10.326 --> 00:04:13.076
&gt;&gt;Teacher: He responds very
well to Renee actually.

00:04:13.126 --> 00:04:14.156
&gt;&gt;Renee: Maybe I
can influence him.

00:04:14.306 --> 00:04:14.646
I don't know.

00:04:15.066 --> 00:04:15.386
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Yes.

00:04:16.186 --> 00:04:17.266
&gt;&gt;Tanya: And out of the
student success teams,

00:04:17.326 --> 00:04:20.626
we are developing lists of
students that we're monitoring

00:04:20.626 --> 00:04:22.786
or providing accommodations
and support,

00:04:23.116 --> 00:04:25.616
and I'm choosing
classes to push into.

00:04:26.536 --> 00:04:28.466
&gt;&gt;Ashley: If a student
is in need

00:04:28.466 --> 00:04:30.026
of social emotional support,

00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:33.466
typically we'll talk
about that at SST.

00:04:33.726 --> 00:04:38.516
Because the problems start
to change as kids get older,

00:04:38.726 --> 00:04:43.146
you start having much more
relational and body image stuff.

00:04:43.146 --> 00:04:46.216
We have to be very creative
about what type of supports

00:04:46.216 --> 00:04:49.716
that we give kids
and who gives them.

00:04:49.716 --> 00:04:52.106
&gt;&gt;Teacher: She tries not to
let anyone know, but she knows,

00:04:52.146 --> 00:04:55.566
like she can come to my office,
if she's just too overwhelmed.

00:04:55.716 --> 00:04:58.666
So she just needs that time to
just talk about it with someone,

00:04:58.666 --> 00:05:01.026
or just to get away from
the classroom setting.

00:05:01.756 --> 00:05:04.246
&gt;&gt;Lynda: Either counselors or
school psychologists might work

00:05:04.246 --> 00:05:06.466
with students who have
some really severe,

00:05:06.466 --> 00:05:09.056
specific needs related to
social emotional learning

00:05:09.346 --> 00:05:11.916
and we would consider that
a tier three intervention.

00:05:13.876 --> 00:05:16.036
&gt;&gt;Renee: When I think having
that individualization,

00:05:16.326 --> 00:05:18.146
it's just made it an
incredible difference

00:05:18.146 --> 00:05:19.386
in terms of our success rate.

00:05:20.096 --> 00:05:26.156
&gt;&gt;Kate: I think it's changed how
we're able to support students.

00:05:26.266 --> 00:05:27.326
&gt;&gt;Renee: Out of twenty-five
kids,

00:05:27.326 --> 00:05:30.686
twenty-four are now passing
and that's actually a real,

00:05:30.686 --> 00:05:31.766
you know, celebration.
