If you're displaying images
downloaded from a network,

00:00:09.852 --> 00:00:12.374
wouldn't it be great
if you could put in a placeholder image

00:00:12.374 --> 00:00:14.056
while you wait for it to download?

00:00:14.523 --> 00:00:17.823
Fortunately, you can with FadeInImage.

00:00:18.231 --> 00:00:22.523
You can specify a local placeholder image
from the <i>assets</i> directory of your app,

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:24.843
or you can do it from memory.

00:00:25.372 --> 00:00:27.410
Set the height and width parameters

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.762
to determine how much space
the image should take up

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:31.744
before and after loading.

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:33.910
Use the <i>fadeInDuration</i> parameter

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.547
to specify how long
the animation should take.

00:00:37.246 --> 00:00:39.346
Set the <i>fadeInCurve</i> to specify

00:00:39.348 --> 00:00:42.963
the way Flutter should animate
the replacement of the placeholder image.

00:00:43.232 --> 00:00:46.072
If you just want your placeholder
to be a transparent image,

00:00:46.072 --> 00:00:48.302
check out the <i>transparent_image</i> package.

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:51.991
For more info on FadeInImage
and all the other Flutter widgets,

00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:53.580
