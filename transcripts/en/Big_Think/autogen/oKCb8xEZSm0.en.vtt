think that you can regulate every single
 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.980
think that you can regulate every single
thing and with this you would have human

so what you really have to do is to come

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090
so what you really have to do is to come
 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.330
so what you really have to do is to come
back and to think what is the most

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340
back and to think what is the most
 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.809
back and to think what is the most
important part of governance now it is

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819
important part of governance now it is
 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.089
important part of governance now it is
my personal opinion that the most

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099
my personal opinion that the most
 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.099
my personal opinion that the most
important part if I talking now about

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.109

democracy is the right answer to that I

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730
democracy is the right answer to that I
 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.729
democracy is the right answer to that I
don't think that shareholders and the

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739
don't think that shareholders and the
 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.800

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519
to exercise the control function that's
 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.339
to exercise the control function that's
why we have the board of directors and

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349
why we have the board of directors and
 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.039
why we have the board of directors and
it is not because one or the other board

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049
it is not because one or the other board
 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.890
it is not because one or the other board
of directors has not been working or

of directors has not been working or
whether there were issues of what I

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510
whether there were issues of what I
 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.770
whether there were issues of what I
would call internal corruption or things

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780
would call internal corruption or things
 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.289
would call internal corruption or things
like this that therefore the model

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299
like this that therefore the model
 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.990
like this that therefore the model
doesn't work I think our model is still

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000
doesn't work I think our model is still
 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.819
doesn't work I think our model is still
working very well you have the

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829
working very well you have the
 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.219
working very well you have the
shareholders who have the ultimate

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:32.229
shareholders who have the ultimate
 

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:35.640
shareholders who have the ultimate
responsibility the exercise is ultimate

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650

rights which they should be using
 

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:42.839
rights which they should be using
strongly and consciously and then

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849
strongly and consciously and then
 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:46.860
strongly and consciously and then
afterwards delegate the power of the of

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870
afterwards delegate the power of the of
 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.780
afterwards delegate the power of the of
the control function of the execution

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790
the control function of the execution
 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.409
the control function of the execution
function to a strong strong board and if

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:52.419
function to a strong strong board and if
 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:54.390

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400
the board is not behaving well you
 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.670
the board is not behaving well you
always have the possibility to eliminate

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680
always have the possibility to eliminate
 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.740
always have the possibility to eliminate
the board members you don't have to

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750
the board members you don't have to
 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.740
the board members you don't have to
reelect the board members so I think

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750
reelect the board members so I think
 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.479

of the board is one of the crucial
 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.619
of the board is one of the crucial
elements of what we are where we should

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:07.629
elements of what we are where we should
 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:13.000
elements of what we are where we should
be going into the future
