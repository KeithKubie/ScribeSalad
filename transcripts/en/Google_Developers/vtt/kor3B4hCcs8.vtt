JEREMY WALKER: Hi, I'm Jeremy
Walker, a YouTube Developer

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:10.789
Advocate.

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:14.570
We're continuing our series with
our GDEs or Google Developer

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.110
Experts.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.660
Again, these are
people that help us out

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:17.590
with the YouTube APIs.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.460
And we're going to talk a little
bit with Tim Wintle today.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.930
And he came out all
the way from London.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:23.870
Enjoy the show.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.050
And we're continuing our
conversation with our GDEs,

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.260
and we have one of the
veterans out here from London.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.509
Tim, how was the flight?

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.120
TIM WINTLE: Fairly long, but OK.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.930
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah,
a little jet lag.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:38.805
I know what you mean.

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:43.180
When I traveled across the pond,
I was little out of it myself.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.210
But you've done great.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.680
So we were talking a little
bit about the Data API, which

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.180
for you that don't
know is basically

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.440
the API that lets you
do most everything you

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.129
do on YouTube but via the API.

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.420
I wanted to get your feeling
from the last year of what

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.820
was the feature that
launched that you

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.480
found the most interesting?

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.040
TIM WINTLE: So I think
the one that immediately

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.090
had the biggest potential was
the in-video programming where

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.450
you can specify particular
thumbnails or particular links

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.280
that you want to come
up to other videos

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.530
at the end of all
of your videos.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.590
JEREMY WALKER: Ah, yeah,
that's a good feature.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.050
For users that don't know, it
gives a nice little overlay

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.610
where you can feature a
video or your channel.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.130
When you were integrating with
it, was there any surprises?

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.080
TIM WINTLE: So just how well
that it works across devices

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.700
compared to some of
the older annotations

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.570
that's been out
for a while where

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.115
it took a very
long time for them

00:01:37.115 --> 00:01:41.120
to start to work on mobile
and on different platforms.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.890
This just seems to
work very cleanly.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.600
JEREMY WALKER: Yes.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.190
That's true.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.300
So for our users that
don't know, in the UI,

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.312
you can create
freeform annotations

00:01:51.312 --> 00:01:53.020
where you can put them
wherever you want.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.875
But like you said, those weren't
supported across every device.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.530
So we covered the surprises.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.880
Do you have any feature
requests or anything

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.260
you'd like to see
in that API, then?

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.425
TIM WINTLE: So I'd love to see
that widen more and enable some

00:02:10.425 --> 00:02:15.990
of the other uses for
the freeform annotations.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:22.320
My favorite one is the select
an interactive video story

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.650
where you can select
your next steps

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.330
to continue the narrative.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.115
Like those skip to page 130.

00:02:30.115 --> 00:02:31.470
JEREMY WALKER: Books.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.570
Yeah, pick your
poison-- I definitely

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.300
know what you're talking about.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.850
Well, great.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.040
Thanks for coming out
and for all the support.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.820
We really appreciate it.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.560
And for the audience,
please join us

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.750
with the interview with
the rest of our experts.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.530
Thank you.
