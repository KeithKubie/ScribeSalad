00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 align:start position:0%
absorbed into the other yeah maybe hey
 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.619 align:start position:0%
absorbed into the other yeah maybe hey
you<00:00:39.450><c> know</c><00:00:39.629><c> it's</c><00:00:39.780><c> probably</c><00:00:40.200><c> yeah</c><00:00:43.460><c> so</c><00:00:44.480><c> so</c><00:00:45.480><c> they</c>

things<00:00:48.870><c> out</c><00:00:49.050><c> and</c><00:00:49.440><c> or</c><00:00:50.340><c> BB</c><00:00:51.149><c> now</c><00:00:51.870><c> that</c><00:00:52.170><c> we</c><00:00:52.289><c> know</c><00:00:52.500><c> um</c>

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 align:start position:0%
things out and or BB now that we know um
 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.709 align:start position:0%
things out and or BB now that we know um
and<00:00:53.989><c> so</c><00:00:54.989><c> she</c><00:00:55.050><c> goes</c><00:00:55.920><c> in</c><00:00:56.250><c> and</c><00:00:56.550><c> finds</c><00:00:56.879><c> these</c><00:00:57.180><c> giant</c>

kind of got colder and colder but that
made<00:09:05.860><c> her</c><00:09:05.980><c> actually</c><00:09:06.579><c> more</c><00:09:06.759><c> interesting</c><00:09:07.540><c> so</c><00:09:08.350><c> to</c>

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:08.470 align:start position:0%
made her actually more interesting so to
 

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:10.590 align:start position:0%
made her actually more interesting so to
be<00:09:08.649><c> I'm</c><00:09:09.189><c> not</c><00:09:09.519><c> saying</c><00:09:09.759><c> they</c><00:09:09.850><c> can't</c><00:09:09.879><c> still</c><00:09:10.569><c> make</c>

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
be I'm not saying they can't still make

showed up on screen was kinda like
 

00:10:09.699 --> 00:10:10.889 align:start position:0%
showed up on screen was kinda like
what's<00:10:09.999><c> she</c><00:10:10.269><c> up</c><00:10:10.449><c> to</c>

00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
yeah what sort of alternate plot here
 

00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:15.900 align:start position:0%
yeah what sort of alternate plot here
like<00:10:14.709><c> that's</c><00:10:14.860><c> how</c><00:10:15.009><c> I</c><00:10:15.040><c> always</c><00:10:15.189><c> looked</c><00:10:15.699><c> at</c><00:10:15.879><c> it</c>

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:15.910 align:start position:0%
like that's how I always looked at it
 

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:18.030 align:start position:0%
like that's how I always looked at it
and<00:10:16.449><c> I</c><00:10:16.629><c> think</c><00:10:16.929><c> that</c><00:10:17.110><c> probably</c><00:10:17.319><c> is</c><00:10:17.679><c> whether</c><00:10:17.949><c> or</c>

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
and I think that probably is whether or
 

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.819 align:start position:0%
and I think that probably is whether or
