altered states refers to a mode of
 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.820
altered states refers to a mode of
consciousness or awareness that takes us

enter altered states when it would get

everyday altered states but they come
 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.270
everyday altered states but they come
from being intensely focused on some

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280
from being intensely focused on some
 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.239
from being intensely focused on some
activity or in the moment itself and of

course altered states can come from
 

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:45.680
course altered states can come from
drugs or from being in an unusual

physiological state a fever can bring on
 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.180
physiological state a fever can bring on
an altered state and of course the 60s

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190
an altered state and of course the 60s
 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.590
an altered state and of course the 60s

and 70s saw a huge upsurge of people
 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.110
and 70s saw a huge upsurge of people
interested in exploring altered states

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120
interested in exploring altered states
 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.020
interested in exploring altered states
through psychedelics so altered states

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030
through psychedelics so altered states
 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.509
through psychedelics so altered states
are temporary conditions when whatever

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519
are temporary conditions when whatever
 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:06.630
are temporary conditions when whatever
it was that brought on the special state

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640
it was that brought on the special state
 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.220
it was that brought on the special state
of awareness leaves then the state fades

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.230
of awareness leaves then the state fades
 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.370
of awareness leaves then the state fades
so you know if you get into a flow state

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380
so you know if you get into a flow state
 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.200
so you know if you get into a flow state
rock climbing when you come down from

the mountain it's gone or whatever may
may have caused that your temperature

may have caused that your temperature
 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.050
may have caused that your temperature
might have gone up and put you in doing

might have gone up and put you in doing
 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.330
might have gone up and put you in doing
maybe not a pleasant altered state but

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340
maybe not a pleasant altered state but
 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.760
maybe not a pleasant altered state but
still an altered state temperature goes

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770
still an altered state temperature goes
 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:27.750
still an altered state temperature goes
down it's gone

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760
down it's gone
 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.900
down it's gone
altered traits on the other hand are

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910
altered traits on the other hand are
 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.270
altered traits on the other hand are
lasting changes or transformations of

lasting changes or transformations of
 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.930
lasting changes or transformations of
being and they come classically through

being and they come classically through
 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.350
being and they come classically through
having cultivated an altered state

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360
having cultivated an altered state

consequence for how you are day-to-day
 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.000

and that's different than how you were

and that's different than how you were
 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.120
and that's different than how you were
before you tried the meditation and what

altered states that's the point if you
 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.400
altered states that's the point if you
look at the classic traditions from

look at the classic traditions from

all of them talk about the quality of

all of them talk about the quality of
 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.070
all of them talk about the quality of
being the person you become and we see

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080
being the person you become and we see
 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.460
being the person you become and we see
it in the data in many ways we see it in

cognitive changes we see it in
 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.160
cognitive changes we see it in
behavioral changes and most importantly

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170
behavioral changes and most importantly
 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.560
behavioral changes and most importantly
we see it in neurological changes the

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570
we see it in neurological changes the

we see it in neurological changes the
neuroscience of meditation is really

neuroscience of meditation is really
 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.360
neuroscience of meditation is really
getting stronger and stronger it's

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370
getting stronger and stronger it's
 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.490
getting stronger and stronger it's
pretty spectacular and it shows that

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500
pretty spectacular and it shows that
 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.190
pretty spectacular and it shows that
brain function and perhaps even

classic meditation texts now the good

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330
classic meditation texts now the good
 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.080
classic meditation texts now the good
news is that there's a dose-response

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090
news is that there's a dose-response
 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.010
news is that there's a dose-response
relationship in meditation and

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020
relationship in meditation and
 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.400
relationship in meditation and
apparently from what we can tell the

apparently from what we can tell the
 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.320
apparently from what we can tell the
longer you do it the more benefits you

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330
longer you do it the more benefits you
 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.960
longer you do it the more benefits you
get so for example right from the

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970
get so for example right from the

their stress benefits you're more

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650
their stress benefits you're more
 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.560
their stress benefits you're more
resilient under stress but we see this

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570
resilient under stress but we see this
 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.530
resilient under stress but we see this
even more strikingly in people who have

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540
even more strikingly in people who have

even more strikingly in people who have
been longer term meditators people who

attention things that don't show up with
 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.360
attention things that don't show up with

attentional blink means you get lost in
 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.850
attentional blink means you get lost in
one thought and you don't notice what's

mind the mind is a mental gym and
meditation is a basic workout so if

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.230
meditation is a basic workout so if
 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.440
meditation is a basic workout so if
you're a long-term meditator you get

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450
you're a long-term meditator you get
 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.690
you're a long-term meditator you get
more benefits than people who are just

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700
more benefits than people who are just
 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.910
more benefits than people who are just
starting out it's just common sense and

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920
starting out it's just common sense and
 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.120
starting out it's just common sense and
we see it in the scientific findings so

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130
we see it in the scientific findings so
 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.640
we see it in the scientific findings so
longer term meditators are better able

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650
longer term meditators are better able
 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.070
longer term meditators are better able
to focus on that one thing and not be

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080
to focus on that one thing and not be
 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.710
to focus on that one thing and not be
distracted even when there's a hubbub

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720
distracted even when there's a hubbub
 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.750
distracted even when there's a hubbub
around them they're better able to

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760
around them they're better able to
 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.810
around them they're better able to
concentrate they're better able to be

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820
concentrate they're better able to be
 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.880
concentrate they're better able to be
present to what's happening so the

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890
present to what's happening so the
 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.920
present to what's happening so the
attentional benefits just get stronger

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930
attentional benefits just get stronger
 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.740
attentional benefits just get stronger
and stronger and even more important

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750
and stronger and even more important
 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.380
and stronger and even more important
they become traits we see them not when

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.390
they become traits we see them not when
 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.110
they become traits we see them not when
a person is meditating but months after

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120
a person is meditating but months after
 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.650
a person is meditating but months after
or just in their everyday life when when

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660
or just in their everyday life when when
 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.870

they come into a lab without meditating

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880
they come into a lab without meditating
 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.030
they come into a lab without meditating
we see that the attentional benefits

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.040
we see that the attentional benefits
 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.090
we see that the attentional benefits
still last the same thing is true of

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100
still last the same thing is true of
 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.480
still last the same thing is true of
stress in long-term meditators the

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490
stress in long-term meditators the
 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.409
stress in long-term meditators the
benefits for handling stress gets

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419
benefits for handling stress gets
 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:24.440
benefits for handling stress gets
stronger and stronger as time goes on of

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.450
stronger and stronger as time goes on of
 

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.570
stronger and stronger as time goes on of
course we see some signs of this in

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580
course we see some signs of this in
 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.909
course we see some signs of this in
people right from the get-go beginners

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919
people right from the get-go beginners
 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:31.040
people right from the get-go beginners
and meditation but the longer you've

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050
and meditation but the longer you've
 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.020
and meditation but the longer you've
been a meditator the more for example

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:33.030
been a meditator the more for example
 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.230

you're able to snap back from

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240
you're able to snap back from
 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.450
you're able to snap back from
upset and this is called this is really

the sign of resilience the resilience is

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:41.389
the sign of resilience the resilience is
 

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:44.260
the sign of resilience the resilience is
measured scientifically by how long it

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.270
measured scientifically by how long it
 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.740
measured scientifically by how long it
takes you to get back to what we call

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:47.750
takes you to get back to what we call
 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.540
takes you to get back to what we call
your baseline that pleasant mood you're

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:49.550
your baseline that pleasant mood you're
 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.260
your baseline that pleasant mood you're
in before that thing flipped you out and

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:52.270
in before that thing flipped you out and
 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:55.510
in before that thing flipped you out and
that the shorter that is the more

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520
that the shorter that is the more
 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.550
that the shorter that is the more
resilient you are and we see this as a

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560
resilient you are and we see this as a
 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.890
resilient you are and we see this as a
lasting trait in long-term meditators

00:06:59.890 --> 00:06:59.900
lasting trait in long-term meditators
 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.650
lasting trait in long-term meditators
they are able to bounce back from stress

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:02.660
they are able to bounce back from stress
 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.350
they are able to bounce back from stress
and also we see that their amygdala that

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360
and also we see that their amygdala that
 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.540
and also we see that their amygdala that
trigger point for the stress reaction is

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.550
trigger point for the stress reaction is
 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.420
trigger point for the stress reaction is
less reactive they're calmer in the face

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:10.430
less reactive they're calmer in the face
 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.960
less reactive they're calmer in the face
of stress so the stress benefits get

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:13.970
of stress so the stress benefits get
 

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:15.790
of stress so the stress benefits get
stronger and stronger and become traits

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:15.800
stronger and stronger and become traits
 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.330
stronger and stronger and become traits
in long-term meditators
