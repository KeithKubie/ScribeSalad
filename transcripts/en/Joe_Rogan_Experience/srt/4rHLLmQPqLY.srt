1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,433
Okay,

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,780
Tommy John, Ladies and gentlemen,
how are you sir? I'm fine man.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:09,330
It's great to see you
again man. You too, Joan.

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:14,390
I tell everybody that one of my first
ever experiences with comedy recordings

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,610
was listening to big
bamboo when I was a kid.

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,300
My parents had it and uh,
they'd let us listen to it.

7
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:25,650
We opened it up like a big old packet of
rolling papers and pull out the albums

8
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:28,260
back then, the actual record, you know?

9
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:31,800
And so I've been a fan for a long time.

10
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:36,180
I can tell him, man, I can tell.
How are you the lower the weed? I'm,

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,540
I'm fine man.
Couldn't be better.

12
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:41,940
I'll be 81.
Right.

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,850
Wow,
that's amazing.

14
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,570
It sounds crazy to say because I'm 51
that sounds crazy to say. When I say it,

15
00:00:47,571 --> 00:00:52,260
I'm like, Jesus, that true fuck,
I'm 30 years older than you. Wow.

16
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:53,110
Wow.

17
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:57,700
That's um, but I feel good man. You
know, all the systems are go again,

18
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:02,200
you know, and that, that makes a
big difference in the life. Yeah.

19
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,970
That's what I found. The Fountain of
Youth is the Pussy. That's it. Yeah.

20
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,000
That's all it is. Drinker to the phone,
their youth and you'll live forever.

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,700
Really? Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
What about if you're gay?

22
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,183
Hmm.

23
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:19,550
Well, I guess on pause. Yeah,
I had to think about that one.

24
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,470
Wow. I guess it might be Dick for
that, I guess. Shit, no, I don't know.

25
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,780
It has to be the fountain.
It has to be the phone.

26
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,310
So even for gay folks gotta
be Pussy to, well, how long?

27
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,670
What's the longest living gig guide
that you know? That's a good question.

28
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,110
Huh? Like Bob Hope,
man. He was he gay? No,

29
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:54,040
no. That's my phone to use
because it, sure. Romance. Well,

30
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:58,690
what happens is your body,
when it reaches a certain stage,

31
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,500
it,

32
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:04,500
it starts disintegrating because it's
getting ready for the recall in the reboot

33
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,180
and you get a new body
and away you go again.

34
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,930
But if you keep this body healthy,

35
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:16,380
it feels that there's no need to leave
because he used obviously still got more

36
00:02:17,381 --> 00:02:22,030
shit to do. Yeah. You're still
enjoying it. Yeah. You're
still producing, you know?

37
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,610
Are you exercising and everything?
Oh yeah. Yeah. What do you do?

38
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:29,380
I've got a trainer now. Yeah.
But my main exercises, tango,

39
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:34,150
tango, tango, retailer, I
will turn you on to tangle.

40
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:39,730
Tangle is old folk sex.
You,

41
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:44,000
you, the whole thing about tango
is it's so intricate. It was a,

42
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,140
the original tango was a mating
dance from Africa, really?

43
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,620
And what they would do, they, the tribes,

44
00:02:50,621 --> 00:02:55,000
a young kids would get together and
dance and flirt with their feet.

45
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,960
And so when the slaves got taken,
you know,

46
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:04,060
from Africa and put on the boats in that,
the ended up crossing the,

47
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:08,080
the foot dance with the
Adagio French dance,

48
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:13,000
the dance of the brothels. And so
the, so then they ended up with a,

49
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:17,500
uh, a music or a dance called
tangle, which was a combination.

50
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,130
Tango itself is a word
that means small drum.

51
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,080
It's an African drum, just like
mom ball. It's an African word.

52
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:29,560
That means a storytelling.
Really? Yeah, Dude.

53
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:32,740
Story time with Tommy Chong
Nail. Yeah, man. I was in jail.

54
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,450
I had nothing but time and I wrote
a whole paper on tango. So anyway,

55
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:42,451
tangle like I go to Argentina with
my wife a lot and it's very tough.

56
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:44,470
Dance to dance with your wife,

57
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:49,000
you have to dance with a stranger
and she has to dance with a stranger.

58
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:53,050
Why is that? I think it's you're
too intimate, too personal.

59
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:57,040
You know each other too.
Well, if you're a stranger,

60
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,980
then all you can respond to is the dance,
uh,

61
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:06,340
signals like the man has to lead,

62
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:11,230
but he has to lead in such a way that,
that you can't see him. You know,

63
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,570
he can't pull her around the
[inaudible], he suggest, oh, okay.

64
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:19,270
Like if, and so he'll suggest a
certain movement and the girl,

65
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:24,070
the his partner will understand that move
and then she can do a couple of steps

66
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,220
and the cer a certain way,

67
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:33,100
like one is called the, uh,
uh, fuck, I can't remember the,

68
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,760
the term, uh, all chose or chose,

69
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,770
which means back and forth and,
and, and out of those combinations,

70
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,100
once a guy gets a girl going
into the Ochoa's for instance,

71
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,520
then you can move on to,

72
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:52,170
he'll stop her with his foot and then
you move on to another series of moves.

73
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,600
And they're all designed and,
but the stranger, Eh, you know,

74
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,380
the woman has to really listen to the,

75
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:04,480
the moves if she's danced
with a stranger or a teacher.

76
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,700
And that's how,

77
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:12,210
and then it has to be a close embrace and
the woman has to be cuddled up against

78
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,550
the guy. Not always,
but for the most part.

79
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:19,900
So you're not looking at your feet
at all and it's all about feel.

80
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:25,380
And so you have to feel the other person's
body and it can get so intimate man

81
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,660
that you really felt after good
dance with a good tango teacher,

82
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:36,900
you really feel like I happened a
cigarette well and relaxing for a bit.

83
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,890
Did you study this? Did you like take
classes? I got turned onto it in Paris.

84
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,760
I was a chief,

85
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:48,110
now we're finishing up the
Corsican brothers and I was, we,

86
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,600
we got offered to do the Cisco Kid and
they sent me the script and in the script

87
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:55,720
said tango dancers.
And so there we,

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,720
my wife and I girlfriend at the time,
but the way for now,

89
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:03,770
we used to drive by this place
that's at tangle in neon lights.

90
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:08,720
And so we stopped and took our
first tango lesson from this,

91
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:11,900
uh,
George and Rosie a couple there.

92
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,150
George was too old to get out of bed.

93
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:17,570
He was in the blood is in his nine
years or something. He was in bed.

94
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,980
Rosie came and met us and we,

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,810
and she showed us the first little
bit of tangle while my wife Shelby,

96
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:27,680
who was an excellent dancer. She's
been studying dance, you know,

97
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,960
ever since. Uh, I can remember,
you know, and so she, she,

98
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:37,760
she started doing salsa first and then
I'd found out about that and I had to

99
00:06:37,761 --> 00:06:38,594
learn salsa,

100
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:44,050
but then we started learning tangled
together and then she went on to really

101
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:48,620
learn how to dance, how to
dance with the prose. Me,

102
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm still struggling to be a pro and
it's very hard. It's like MMA fighting,

103
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,800
you know, like she's a pro.
I'm an amateur. And so when I,

104
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:01,790
when we go down to boiling desires,
like we went down for her birthday, um,

105
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,400
I was the video operator because I
didn't know how to dance, you know, that.

106
00:07:07,401 --> 00:07:11,810
Well, I take lessons
almost, uh, 20 years now,

107
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,900
but it's still don't have the skills to,

108
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:19,580
to be a professional life
like, like that. But, uh,

109
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,380
yeah. So I went down and videotaped her
and then I came back and I made a vow.

110
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:26,240
I says, this is embarrassing, you know,

111
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:30,560
because people know me from years
ago and I still can't dance.

112
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,070
So, so it's, it's about
time that I learned.

113
00:07:34,071 --> 00:07:39,071
So I gave up everything to learn tango
and are willing to give up golf more than

114
00:07:40,341 --> 00:07:42,920
anything. Really. Yeah. There's a lot
of guys right now that are going crazy.

115
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:47,000
Why would you give up golf for a tango?
Well, actually it worked out really well.

116
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:50,960
I played a tournament golf, uh, last
week and I did the best I've ever done.

117
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:55,460
If you lay off something, you forget all
your bad habits. Oh, that's true too.

118
00:07:55,461 --> 00:07:56,021
And you probably will.

119
00:07:56,021 --> 00:08:00,650
I'm really enthusiastic about planning
and loved it and I wasn't. I did good.

120
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:05,600
I got about two pars. Incredible
for, you know, for me,

121
00:08:05,601 --> 00:08:10,540
I'm, you know, I've got about a 36
handicap, something like that. But uh, so,

122
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:14,600
but I gave up golf because it's too much
energy was taken too much energy. Sure.

123
00:08:14,601 --> 00:08:16,250
You gotta walk around all the time.
Yeah.

124
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,260
I would also imagine
that the tango dancing,

125
00:08:18,261 --> 00:08:20,900
all the movement in the footwork would
actually probably make you more steady

126
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:24,440
and stable, balanced, better.
So I'd probably make your
golf game better. Oh, it did.

127
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,650
Totally, totally. I
noticed that with a yoga,

128
00:08:27,651 --> 00:08:32,270
Yoga makes pool better in some weird way.
Like it makes it stands stronger. Yeah.

129
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:37,340
Yeah. So there's also
a, a pause and comedy.

130
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:43,040
Someone asked me about the secret
accommodated as a pause in the tangle as

131
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:47,000
opposed to the timing, the
timing, waiting, waiting,

132
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,320
waiting and using that,
that, that silence, you know,

133
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:56,160
before you say something to give
people the time to formulate their own

134
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,750
sites about what you're doing or do,

135
00:08:57,751 --> 00:09:02,220
concentrate on what you're going to
say next. And the, and that's the same,

136
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:05,790
same thing with tango. Is this you? Yeah.

137
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,120
That's me with a PDU. You on dancing
with the stars. Oh, Shit. Yeah.

138
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:15,650
How hard was that to do? Oh, it's
incredible. [inaudible] or every,

139
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:20,410
what the hell is going on
here? Good Lord. When he,

140
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:24,540
same time that we did
it, we did it. We did it.

141
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:29,510
Wow. Yeah. Rainy, cold drink and a 10,
uh, looked like Randy was crying. Yeah.

142
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:34,290
What's his name? Uh, Kevin Hart.
Kevin Hart was a judge. Yeah.

143
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,450
He gave me a 10. Oh, that's the
only thing I got. Look at Legos.

144
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,060
She had to carry me
off there. Wow. Oh Man.

145
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,370
That tour my butter.

146
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:49,290
I imagine literally serious fucking
the training for that. I came off.

147
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,800
That was rectal cancer. Whoa. I got,

148
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:56,400
I found out on that
show. Wow. How'd you do?

149
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,520
You don't think you got it from dancing?
I always,

150
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:03,450
I got it from a no smoking and,
uh,

151
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:08,130
and the stress from no smoking
weed in real smoking weed.

152
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,440
I quit smoking weed during the show.
Why did you do that?

153
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,190
I thought it would help me with my,
uh,

154
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:18,640
coordination or something like that with
me being there listening, you know? Yeah.

155
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,770
Because it's hard to learn things when
you're styling something that certain

156
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,570
saying, yeah. Like in Jujitsu, uh,

157
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:28,980
most people agree that it's not a good
idea to smoke pot when you're learning

158
00:10:28,981 --> 00:10:32,720
skills, but it's a good idea to smoke
pot when you have the skills. Yeah. Yeah.

159
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,790
It'll calm you down. Yeah. When you
roll and you already know what to do,

160
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:38,820
it's like instinctive, then you can
smoke some pot. Yeah. But like learning,

161
00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:40,890
like if someone shows me
a new move and I'm high,

162
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:43,890
I can't even figure out where the
body's calling McWane. Where's your arm?

163
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,270
How am I doing this? You get too high and
then what am I doing? You get baffled.

164
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:51,390
Yeah. Yeah. Well that's
the same as tango. Well,

165
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:54,920
so you really think that that
happened to you because of that? See,

166
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:59,930
I had prostate cancer and it was a
kind of process was so slow acting.

167
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,720
Lazy ass doctor said,
well, we won't do it.

168
00:11:03,721 --> 00:11:07,110
We'll just leave it alone and you're
probably die of something else before that

169
00:11:07,111 --> 00:11:11,730
happens. And so there's this attitude
that was their attitudes as crop dusters.

170
00:11:11,731 --> 00:11:14,790
Yeah. It happens all the time,
you know, because you know,

171
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:19,230
prostate can be very slow.
And I had a slow one and black,

172
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:24,210
I had a biopsy when I had to find out
cause I was going to do the growth

173
00:11:24,211 --> 00:11:28,790
hormone. Uh, and that's why I
checked out my blood to make sure I,

174
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:32,420
you know, I didn't have cancer
found out I had prostate cancer and,

175
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:36,240
but they did a biopsy and I think
that could have done it, you know,

176
00:11:36,241 --> 00:11:38,490
the biopsy and they can
be take a piece of your,

177
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:42,330
so you think that taking a biopsy could
have caused the damage which could have

178
00:11:42,331 --> 00:11:46,110
led the cancer, could have, could
have caused the cancer cell to,

179
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,970
to hit the direct them the way it did.
And so I got a bag now,

180
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:53,620
I got a clause to me
bag, you know, so, but

181
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:58,390
no, I'm, I'm totally healed now in,
in, I'm, I'm, I'm good to go. You know,

182
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:03,450
the only thing,
so I don't know if it was the,

183
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,940
the lack of weed and stress and,

184
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,180
and the fact that I had prostate,
you know,

185
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,300
so when they fixed the
rectal and I got the best,

186
00:12:13,301 --> 00:12:17,260
one of the best doctor could Jay Indian,
what'd they have to do? They had operate,

187
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,820
they had to take out change the
plumbing from the, uh, from the front,

188
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:26,150
from the back to the front. That's
a colostomy bag. So you, so I,

189
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:30,310
I have no more rectum.
Wow. So a virgin again.

190
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:36,020
I'm kidding. And then you put the
bag around to the front and uh,

191
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,580
that's all they did there. And
then I had then, but what they did,

192
00:12:39,581 --> 00:12:43,730
they swept the prostate clean with
the radiation. They said we're,

193
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,510
we're down there anyways,
so we might as well do the prostate to,

194
00:12:46,511 --> 00:12:51,220
so the pics to prostate and thank God I
never had it taken out because now I can,

195
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,750
I got this sleeping giant is a woke again.

196
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:01,060
Sleeping giant. Yeah. I
woke the sleeping giant of,

197
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:05,470
I think it was the weed that did it
too, plus my gorgeous weight. But yeah,

198
00:13:05,471 --> 00:13:09,370
I started getting these urges and I
said, Oh, oh, what's happening here?

199
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,930
And I'm doing testosterone and
that's probably what, yeah,

200
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:17,650
the toss testosterone and then, and then
I'm going in for a shot tomorrow. That's,

201
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:21,400
it's a,
it's a new procedure that uh,

202
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:26,580
they use apparently to help induce labor
because it's all about blood flow down

203
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:32,120
there and so it's going to induce, I
tried pills, I tried Viagra, you know,

204
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,260
doesn't,
doesn't work enough.

205
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:39,520
And so I'm going in tomorrow for a,
an injection of some,

206
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,140
some help to blood so they help
the giant get a little more awake.

207
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,910
Now when you went to jail, you had
your, you or your cakes was horrible.

208
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:49,541
I mean it was,

209
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:54,100
it was so depressing to hear that you
were going to jail for making bongs. Yeah.

210
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:55,250
It just,

211
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,330
the whole thing was so sick and that they
were threatening to put your family in

212
00:13:58,331 --> 00:14:00,280
jail and then that's all
they sent you to jail.

213
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,650
You couldn't small part for awhile
after that. For years. How long? Um,

214
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,830
probably three years. Because
you're on probation, probation,

215
00:14:08,831 --> 00:14:13,060
pre probation before you went to jail?
Pre, pretrial. Because if you get caught,

216
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:17,250
vignette ended up getting tortured
while the whole time I was there,

217
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,980
nine months I was there, I couldn't
smoke. They tested me all the time.

218
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:25,870
They try to catch me and they had nothing
to catch and then a year after that I

219
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:28,840
was on probation and I never smoked.
I can quit,

220
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:32,530
you know I got willpower,
you know, I can quit.

221
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,240
I put smoke and I quit drinking.
I quit eating bad for what?

222
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,480
But you had the wreck.

223
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:41,440
Well for one thing that happened that was
great was that you became even more of

224
00:14:41,441 --> 00:14:44,650
a hero to the cannabis community
because people know, yeah,

225
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:48,910
you truly were a martyr and then
it was outrageous and it was so,

226
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:52,250
it was so wrong that even people

227
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,460
that didn't smoke pot really kind of a
fuck you arrest and Tommy Chong like,

228
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,271
come on man.

229
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:59,510
Like all the terrorists in the world
of criminals and rapists and murderers.

230
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,790
I know you going to put
Tommy John and Joe. Yeah,

231
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,790
like what are we protecting or serving?
What are we doing here? Which one?

232
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,200
Which one is that? Yeah, they were
just showing off, showing off.

233
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:11,210
But once I sent him a message,
which I got in

234
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,470
the new with a lot of people
that were unjustly incarcerated,

235
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,500
I was in there with the orthopedic
surgeon for the rams and he,

236
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,440
he,
he had been in a tax,

237
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,160
it wasn't legal at the time he did it,

238
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:31,130
which was that he had a
big car collection and he,

239
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,500
and he rode off the
car collection somehow.

240
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:38,930
And then the IRS changed people.
And next thing you know, the,

241
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:42,830
they came to him and said, you all
this money and if you don't pay it,

242
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,130
you gotta go to jail. And he
couldn't pay it. So he went to jail.

243
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,630
This is orthopedic surgeon
and he's like super straight.

244
00:15:50,631 --> 00:15:52,460
The straight is one of the
straightest guys ever met.

245
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:57,410
And there was another guy that,
that figured out the Oj tax scheme.

246
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,810
You know how old Jay can keep as

247
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:06,230
money from the hand chain? Thousands
in Florida. Yeah. Well it's a,

248
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:11,230
it's a law that, a loophole
that allowed, you know,

249
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:16,160
Oj to keep us taxes. I mean
tax free money. And so,

250
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:20,840
so this accountant figured out how to
do it and he started getting rich people

251
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,300
so they didn't have to pay taxes.

252
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:27,140
And so rather than to change the
law or do anything like that,

253
00:16:27,141 --> 00:16:31,760
they just put his ass in jail because he
could and they put them in there for a

254
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,480
year and he wasn't doing anything illegal.
Nothing illegal except,

255
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,950
and then they told them,
or you're going to get out in a year,

256
00:16:39,951 --> 00:16:44,720
but you're not going to do
that tax thing anymore. Wow.

257
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,000
Yeah. No one knows the
government. The IRS is creep. Oh,

258
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,840
do not want to owe them money.
Especially if you're Trump. Oh,

259
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,870
well they're coming after him right now.
Right.

260
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,150
What are they coming after him for now?

261
00:16:56,151 --> 00:17:00,350
They'd like New York state is allowing
Congress to subpoena his tax returns.

262
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:05,310
Note Your Bank. They got
his accountant, his account.

263
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:08,540
Nothing to do with the federal government.
I tell everybody,

264
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:09,770
why would you want to be president?

265
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,430
Like why would you want to do that
to yourself on the sure. Super Clean.

266
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,670
And that even if you're super
clean, they're gonna make
shit up about, you know,

267
00:17:16,671 --> 00:17:21,100
the only reason Trump did it is because
you'll put in so much money. You thanks.

268
00:17:21,101 --> 00:17:23,030
So [inaudible].
Pretty sure.

269
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,311
Pretty sure.

270
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:29,311
How did this lose her billionaire get
financed over and over and over again.

271
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,670
And guess who's allowed during money?
Like crazy from Russia,

272
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:37,960
the guy that needs the money? No, the
whole Trump family is going to go down.

273
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:41,600
You think so? Oh, pretty sure. Taxes me.

274
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:46,630
Al Capone to Donald Trump.
You can't evade taxes.

275
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,850
So do you think that he owes taxes?
He owes Putin.

276
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:56,070
He always Putin so much money that he is
scared to death. How do you know this?

277
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:02,610
Common Sense. Oh, okay. So it's a
guess or know it figured out. Okay,

278
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,090
let's go down the history.
Uh,

279
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,460
call me is a FBI, right? Uh, Mueller,

280
00:18:11,461 --> 00:18:15,780
the FBI Trump was attacking,
uh,

281
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:19,430
Obama with the birther Obama's,

282
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,700
the President Obama has got control
over the FBI, CIA, everybody.

283
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:28,230
So Obama said, okay, find
out about this Trump guy.

284
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,090
So they found out about him.

285
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,340
But the thing is they can't
really do anything on this.

286
00:18:35,341 --> 00:18:39,960
He becomes president. Other than
that, he just walk away free.

287
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,160
No one gives decision, you know,
here's, here's really Brazil anything.

288
00:18:44,161 --> 00:18:47,260
Unless he becomes president.
Yeah. Or You mean the FBI?

289
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,660
There's no breaking the law.

290
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:52,080
There's no law that says that
you can't deal with Russia.

291
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:56,730
Only law says you can't deal with Russia
and be the president of the United

292
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:00,180
States at the same time. The only time
he would break any laws is that if,

293
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,050
if he became president and
he has to become president,

294
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,480
and he became president,

295
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,460
thanks to call me because
Hillary was gonna win,

296
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:16,140
no matter what they say.
Hillary was gonna win until Komi said,

297
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:20,520
oh, [inaudible] stuff
came up. And they knew.

298
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,640
They knew back in Obama time that
there was nothing really wrong.

299
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,260
Hillary did nothing,
nothing.

300
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:33,360
But they told her to release emails
since she deleted 30,000 of them. So,

301
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,210
but she wasn't supposed to do that.
That's illegal.

302
00:19:36,211 --> 00:19:40,890
And she was using her own personal
email server instead of the governments,

303
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:44,790
which was, it was utter laziness
and convenience. More than,

304
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,910
more than anything illegal.
You know,

305
00:19:47,911 --> 00:19:52,620
she wasn't looking to get financed to
her hotel by the Russians. You know,

306
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:57,000
she wasn't looking for money. Her and Bill
had money. They got money. Yeah, they,

307
00:19:57,001 --> 00:20:00,900
yeah, they, it's a little fishy little
s little stinkies stuff around there.

308
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:05,950
But it's normal. It's a, it's a
normal politics. So my theory is,

309
00:20:05,951 --> 00:20:10,200
is that Comey and the FBI said,
let's get this guy.

310
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,930
So you think they let him become
president so they can get them?

311
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,650
I think bars part of the,
part of the, the, the,

312
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:20,580
the call me gang. This, you know what's
going to be hilarious about this,

313
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:23,960
this video, when people watch this,
they're gonna go, how high is Tommy?

314
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:30,820
Tommy challenge made Trump president
so they could prosecute them.

315
00:20:31,051 --> 00:20:34,380
Yeah. Yeah. That's an interesting
theory. Yeah. I don't know if I buy it,

316
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,710
but think about, I don't think anybody's
controlling the strings that well,

317
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:41,280
but since they papa tears so
that good. But listen, it,

318
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:45,240
look at everybody that was around
Trump that became chief of staff and

319
00:20:45,241 --> 00:20:47,770
everything else. All military. Right? Why?

320
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:51,760
Because Trump, Trump's got his
finger on the, on the button.

321
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,850
He's got ability to get on the button.

322
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,850
And so in order to keep him in line,

323
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:02,320
they got people around him that can keep
them in mind. Yeah. Yeah. And the FBI,

324
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:06,220
they, they can infiltrate anything.
They infiltrated the mob for years.

325
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:08,790
They infiltrated the,
the hell's angels.

326
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,040
Do you think they couldn't
infiltrate Donald Trump's gang?

327
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,770
But do you think they were trying to like,
absolutely.

328
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,570
We'll be just because him
going after Obama with the
birther stuff, it's a start.

329
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,310
Yeah. You mess with the
president. Look at that.

330
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,270
And Darby people were saying
he was from Kenya. Right.

331
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:29,930
There's some ridiculous Photoshop
analysis and his birth certificate.

332
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,760
Anything to keep a black guy
from being a president. Yeah.

333
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:38,050
And that's what they found out. And,
and the FBI and the federal lives,

334
00:21:38,051 --> 00:21:42,400
you know, against racism.
And that's pretty, pretty,
pretty strict. Pretty heavy,

335
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:46,090
you know, until Trump got
in and so, so, so anyway,

336
00:21:46,091 --> 00:21:50,720
this is my theory that that does some
gas theory right there. Yeah. Like,

337
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:55,720
like I, I really feel that Giuliani is,
is part of the scheme to keep Trump,

338
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:01,300
you know, why was hope? Well, he
gives them hope, you know, hey,

339
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:05,370
they can't look at your taxes. You're the
president for Christ sake. Uh, you know.

340
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:09,190
Yeah, you're the supreme
leader. He does have some,

341
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:12,250
there is some things they won't do.
One year an office,

342
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,970
they won't indict you for certain things
once you're at the office and so they

343
00:22:15,971 --> 00:22:18,130
plan it. We'll look at
Moeller said, he says,

344
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:22,870
I'm going to hand this off to the
congress. You can impeach him.

345
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:28,030
Here's all the evidence you need to
impeach him and know the Democrats.

346
00:22:28,031 --> 00:22:30,730
You've got to figure out are we going
to impeach him go through that or are we

347
00:22:30,731 --> 00:22:33,430
just going to go to the election and
beat his ass in the election and then

348
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,110
didn't arrest him after the election?

349
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:38,920
Who Do you think he's going to beat
him in the election? Anybody? Anybody.

350
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,580
You think Joe time of them? Oh yeah.
Really? Oh yeah, you are higher.

351
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:48,520
No strong. We, where are you getting
it? Well look at, look at the trunk.

352
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,680
The trunk backers for instance.

353
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:55,990
Can you find one thinker in that
backing group? Well, I mean,

354
00:22:55,991 --> 00:22:59,980
who are, we were talking about the
same thing. You know, can, can,

355
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:03,850
can think racism blinds you.
Right?

356
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,350
But what racism, racism is
ignorance. It's a form of ignorance.

357
00:23:08,351 --> 00:23:12,940
I've got her down, I had it in my family,
you know, so I know exactly. I've been,

358
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:13,990
I've been,
you know,

359
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:18,160
kissing clothes to racist
and I know that mentality.

360
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,120
And so pure ignorance.
Yeah,

361
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:24,580
pure ignorance and ignorance
doesn't stop with one thing.

362
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:29,610
It carries on to a lot a lot of other
things like work and like all sorts of

363
00:23:30,431 --> 00:23:34,480
things. And so when you look at
the people that are opposing Trump,

364
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:40,150
you know, the, the, the
women, the, the kids,

365
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,330
the intellectuals,
the uh,

366
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,470
the liberals progressive's

367
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:50,660
all those people they want,
they want a good future for our country.

368
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,130
You know,
the other ones,

369
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:57,080
they just want to keep everybody
else out or perceived enemies.

370
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,470
It's perceived enemies that anybody,
like anybody with a gun,

371
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:05,330
that's the whole thing. You know, if you
have a gun, you're not very intelligent.

372
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:09,260
Why is that? Because you're
paranoid. You're women.

373
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,550
If you have a gun, you're not
intelligent because you're paranoid.

374
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,560
Having a gun means that you're afraid
that someone's going to come in and

375
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:23,480
attack, you know? Right. And,

376
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:27,920
and so that having a gun is like, like
they want to arm teachers for instance.

377
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:32,570
That seemed kind of crazy. Yeah.
That is so stupid. It is so dumb.

378
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:36,260
You know, just like the ones
that knew or know about guns,

379
00:24:36,261 --> 00:24:41,130
like the cops didn't go into the school.
They knew the guy's got an k,

380
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,540
they're not going to go into that
school with their little pistols.

381
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,710
And so they didn't go into the school.
And the ones that rushed to guide,

382
00:24:48,711 --> 00:24:52,370
they ended up dying.
So what I'm saying is that if you,

383
00:24:52,371 --> 00:24:56,060
if you have a gun at you, if you
think you need a gun for your house,

384
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:56,860
for whatever,

385
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:00,530
and if you think you have something
that's where someone else's life,

386
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:04,280
then you are ignorant. Well, I don't
necessarily think that's what they think.

387
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,620
They don't think that the gun
is worth someone else's life.

388
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:09,780
They think they don't want to get their
life taken by a homerun mention. Yeah.

389
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:10,723
Which does happen.

390
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:14,540
Did you see that video of the guy
that had a raccoon on his boat?

391
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:21,270
He had a raccoon on his boat. Yeah, he was
saw he packed back any, any and it, no,

392
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,580
it was a wild raccoon.

393
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,640
And he filmed it and he's 20 miles
out to sea and he sees this raccoon.

394
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:32,000
And so he filmed himself kicking the
raccoon off the boat, into the ocean,

395
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,660
into the ocean.
He filmed it and then he went,

396
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:40,250
he posted it because he had
no idea how ignorant that was.

397
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,160
Had no idea as the raccoon dangerous.

398
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:47,630
Was it trying to blacklist you will
fuck you up. We'll fuck you. Sure, sure.

399
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:51,410
But like the wild. But the wild
guys, the wildlife guy said,

400
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:54,620
just get a blanket, show it
over and put him in the, in the,

401
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:58,850
in the bathroom until you close to shore
and then kick them off. Yeah. You know,

402
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:02,540
but this guy right away, he freaked out
and he's like, this is my cut off my boat.

403
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:05,150
Terrible way. I'm not going
to die. Well, see that's,

404
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:09,140
that's a form of ignorance that, that
I'm talking about. It's also just fear.

405
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:12,800
It's fear. That's what, that's
what fear is. Fear is ignorance,

406
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,920
but if someone has a gun in their
house to protect themselves from home

407
00:26:15,921 --> 00:26:20,060
invasions, home invasions do happen and
people have saved their family with guns.

408
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,200
That's a real thing that you don't read
about that much. Oh, you read about it.

409
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:26,840
Planning, if you go looking for it, it
really, yeah, there's all my stores.

410
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,050
If you look at the overall,

411
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:34,380
did they have like a pie chart of
gun violence in this country and an

412
00:26:34,431 --> 00:26:37,130
unfortunately large number is suicides.

413
00:26:37,131 --> 00:26:39,650
And I started talking about how many
people have died, unfortunately,

414
00:26:39,651 --> 00:26:41,000
large number of suicide by gun.

415
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:43,980
And I feel like if people are going
to kill with a gun, they'd probably

416
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,010
kill them as whole. The pills or anything
else that they had that as well. Right.

417
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:52,290
And then there's justifiable
homicides by the police. There's,

418
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,760
there's people that are protecting their
house. There's a bunch of different,

419
00:26:56,761 --> 00:26:59,670
these gang violence as a
bunch of different things
that get lumped in when we

420
00:26:59,671 --> 00:27:00,960
talk about gun violence.

421
00:27:00,961 --> 00:27:04,860
But a certain percentage of them are
people that are protecting their house or

422
00:27:04,861 --> 00:27:07,680
their help their, their family from
someone who's trying to hurt them.

423
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:08,850
It does happen.

424
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:11,530
Cash I'm in business
with, with uh, with a x,

425
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:16,070
a pilot from Vietnam and uh,
I'm quite sure you hit,

426
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:19,120
he has a side arm in his,
his house.

427
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:24,130
But it would be useless because it's so
locked away and so hidden by the time

428
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:28,120
anything happened by the time he got to
that gun and got it loaded and found the

429
00:27:28,121 --> 00:27:30,010
ammunition, everything else. Yeah, maybe.

430
00:27:30,011 --> 00:27:34,460
Or maybe he could keep it right by his
bed. No spoken to his house in this,

431
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,870
this one instance.
And then what,

432
00:27:36,871 --> 00:27:41,830
what if it's your daughter or something
coming in late at night and you mistake

433
00:27:41,831 --> 00:27:42,750
her for all,

434
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:47,770
you open your mouth and say something
possible shooting into the dark or what if

435
00:27:47,861 --> 00:27:52,861
you have a homicide cidal tendencies
and you've been wanting to see the one

436
00:27:53,741 --> 00:27:56,920
thing I learned about guns, cause I
grew up with guns too. I grew up in the,

437
00:27:56,921 --> 00:28:01,240
in the country. And where'd you grow up in
Calgary, Alberta. Canada. Oh really? Oh,

438
00:28:01,241 --> 00:28:04,150
that's right. You're Canadian.
Yeah. Crane. So guns,

439
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:08,260
guns were thinking about moving
back up there. Oh No, I lived,

440
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:11,930
I lived up there. Oh No,
I lived there. Oh No, no.

441
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:16,210
La is where you want to be. But I grew
up with, with, with guns where you,

442
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,360
where you actually needed to gun,
you know, like, especially when the,

443
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,590
when the hawks are coming down
to get your chickens or you know,

444
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:29,310
some stuff like that.
But I seen the gun culture in,

445
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:34,480
in, in Calgary and it turned
me off because I seen kids,

446
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:35,831
they would take a,

447
00:28:35,831 --> 00:28:40,831
a stray dog in time and bring him up to
the field time to a tree or something or

448
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:46,930
post and then shoot him.
Oh Jesus. Shoot him.

449
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,400
That is sport, you know. Uh, and,

450
00:28:50,401 --> 00:28:53,070
and they couldn't because
here's the thing about guns. Oh,

451
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,200
I went duck hunting with my
brother one time and, uh,

452
00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:00,310
in the field and Acre board
waiting for the ducks to come.

453
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:05,560
And so here comes a, um, uh, what
do you call it? Is that your phone?

454
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:10,230
Yeah, I'm sorry. That's okay. I don't
know if you've read, it's out there.

455
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,660
[inaudible] he turned it off. Uh, uh, no,

456
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:18,310
we went duck hunting and we're waiting
there for hours where the ducks to come

457
00:29:18,311 --> 00:29:19,210
over.
And my brother,

458
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,270
he got bored and there's a
Muskrat swimming across the thing.

459
00:29:22,271 --> 00:29:26,270
So he shot it with a shotgun and he
walks out into the middle of the,

460
00:29:26,271 --> 00:29:31,271
of the slew picks up the most grit
as the ducks flew over top of us.

461
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,500
Just stupidity, man. That's
definitely stupid. But there's
responsible gun owners,

462
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:42,450
don't you think? Well, let's
see. Are like, all right. I,

463
00:29:42,451 --> 00:29:45,820
I was in army cadets and when we,
we had practice, I'm a, I'm a,

464
00:29:45,821 --> 00:29:50,500
I'm a sharp shooter by the way.
Yeah, yeah. I got some, some,

465
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:55,330
what do you call it? Patches, you
know, sharp shooter, uh, 300 yards. So,

466
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:59,110
so I,
I know how to handle a rifle anyway,

467
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,710
but when we would go shooting,

468
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,500
we would have to,
first of all,

469
00:30:05,501 --> 00:30:10,501
we never got the weapon and until we
marched down into firing position than we

470
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:13,540
were handed the weapon.

471
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:18,100
And one bullet and then we
put the bullet in the target.

472
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:21,910
And another bullet. Shoot the target.
And then when we were finished,

473
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:25,000
we had to pick up all our
casings and give them back.

474
00:30:25,001 --> 00:30:29,530
And if anything was missing, no one left
until they found that missing bullet.

475
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,740
And that's gun safety.
Yeah.

476
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:35,980
Then the gun was taken from
us and put it in an armory.

477
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,250
It's only used when you're
going to use it, you know,

478
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,320
it's just like walking around
with a skill saw. You know,

479
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,810
you can have a license to carry a skilsaw,

480
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,840
but you don't have a skilsaw strapped to
your side and you can take out and try

481
00:30:48,911 --> 00:30:52,990
your skilsaw anytime you want. And this
is the open carry thing is very strange.

482
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:56,380
Let me see. People walking around with
guns strapped to their hips in Arizona.

483
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,640
You're like, okay, they're
targets. Why don't you do
that? You're a target in a way.

484
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,820
Yeah. It's like the bikers, bikers,

485
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:08,470
you know the hell's angels and the Mongols
in that nearly go. Only in Synagis.

486
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,970
I know that that advertise
on their back.

487
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:18,070
Look at me. Yeah. Look at me. I'm
a thug. I'm a, you know, I extort,

488
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:21,070
I do all sorts. I beat
up people, I kill people.

489
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:25,990
Aaron and I write on a big Hog,
you know? I mean it's crazy.

490
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:30,430
But people do that for recognition.
Yeah. See that's what like mass shooters,

491
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:33,400
that's what they do at four.
Get their name in the paper and look at,

492
00:31:33,401 --> 00:31:37,270
I did look at useless. Sold me
on the side. So utilization.

493
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:40,840
What's the craziest thing about mass
shooters as it's not a threat? I mean,

494
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:42,280
guns have been around for a long time,

495
00:31:42,281 --> 00:31:44,410
but this is not a thing that's
been around for a long time. Now.

496
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:48,850
This is a fairly recent thing that keeps
erupting over and over and over again.

497
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:52,510
I didn't know you were too young
to remember, but when I was a kid,

498
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:58,330
the crime comics were band.
You're a band.

499
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,400
They were banned because they were bad.

500
00:32:00,401 --> 00:32:05,260
They showed violence despite
books. Comic books. Wow.

501
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:10,320
And they were people up in arms about
comic books and now you got video games.

502
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:15,730
Where were you going to be a mass killer?
Well, how about movies? You know, I mean,

503
00:32:15,731 --> 00:32:19,390
so many movies. So these John Wick
movies, it's everybody's getting shot.

504
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:23,510
Everybody by one of my favorites
to peppermint with permit.

505
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:28,360
What's up Jennifer Gardner?
I've just seen that.

506
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:32,710
Oh, what did I get? Oh, she's a
superhero. Oh. Or, or peppermint.

507
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:37,430
The name of the is peppermint and
here are the Sammy, you're out

508
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,010
or something.
Not that long

509
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:44,300
ago. Yeah. That's great. I
watched it about three times now.

510
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,540
And the, yeah. Why have you
watched it so many times?

511
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:52,490
I think Jennifer Garner was kind of hot.
Oh, okay. And in this year to see her,

512
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,290
to see her with the guns in there.

513
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:58,550
And the third time I realized a
lot of it were stunt stunt people.

514
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:02,860
How can you tell? Just, I seen
it so many times. It wasn't jobs.

515
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,110
You're looking for everything.
I'm looking for that little thing.

516
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:10,820
But again, that's the kind of
violence that we get shown.

517
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,470
And people get him immune. Yes.
And especially, especially,

518
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:21,200
uh, people, they get stupid.
You know, like when I was a kid,

519
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:25,040
I saw my brother died recently
and there's a whole picture,

520
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:30,130
a photo thing of him and I when we were
kids and they used to get put under the

521
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:35,940
Christmas tree, six guns. And
we're, when we're little guys, we,

522
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:38,450
we're three or four years old.

523
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:41,900
I had six gun strapped to my myself,
you know,

524
00:33:41,901 --> 00:33:46,220
because the cowboys,
Lord Rogers and Gene Audrey.

525
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:49,660
And that was a big deal. You know,
you had your six gun shooters,

526
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:53,720
but you never shot anybody. You just shut
the gun out of their hand, you know? Sad.

527
00:33:53,721 --> 00:33:55,960
That was the old days. Yeah, right.

528
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:58,520
The good guys always shot people in the
hand that shot the gun away from him.

529
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:03,610
You gotta be like, all
right, you got me. Yeah,

530
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,440
definitely. World. Yeah. It does.

531
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:11,710
Going from the old days to big
bamboo to where we're at today,

532
00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:16,250
where you're actually in the weed business
now. Oh, you know what, John's choice,

533
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:20,340
which is crazy, right? It's like you
were arrested for just selling glasses.

534
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,310
How many years ago was that?
Like 15 1303 oh three 16 years ago.

535
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:30,260
16 years ago, you were arrested for just
selling glass, 2019 yourself full on.

536
00:34:30,261 --> 00:34:35,180
We'd, we'd be in four or five
countries. That's crazy. Germany,

537
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:38,810
Spain. You can, you were so
ahead of the curve. Yeah.

538
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:44,120
But you also, you were one of the
real ogs that paid a price. Yep. Yep.

539
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,470
And you know,

540
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:50,510
now it's gotta be nice to see that your
influence had something to do with all

541
00:34:50,511 --> 00:34:54,500
this. It did. It feels really well.
Really, that's all your movies. I mean,

542
00:34:54,501 --> 00:34:57,980
you guys made, we'd look fun.
Yeah. Yeah. It was fun. Yeah.

543
00:34:57,981 --> 00:35:00,080
But everybody made it out
like a, you know, you go from,

544
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:03,980
if you think about propaganda, positive
and negative, you go from reefer madness,

545
00:35:03,981 --> 00:35:06,380
which is the most negative to
the Cheech and Chong movies,

546
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:09,800
which is probably the most positive,
most positive up until like half baked.

547
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,370
That was the most positive
we'd stuff we ever saw. Right.

548
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:18,340
It was so super positive. It was all
just silly. Yeah. Fun, crazy, crazy,

549
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:22,220
silly, uh, humor, ghetto humor. You know,

550
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:26,030
a lot of ghetto humor and, and,
and I want it to be the rich guy.

551
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:30,980
You know the kid of the rich guy cause
that's what the 60s happen, you know,

552
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:34,030
all the hip, you know, in order to
get laid you had to be a hippie.

553
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:39,570
So all the rich kids growing their
hair long and you know, through,

554
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:44,100
you know, living on the streets,
all that stuffs. Yeah. Yeah.

555
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:48,600
You guys a popular as vans too and we,
you know, yeah. You know we used to,

556
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:52,740
we used to say when we'd be on the radio,

557
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,330
some of the radio shows and I,

558
00:35:55,350 --> 00:36:00,350
and I was really popular on right wing
radio shows cause I would inflame the

559
00:36:01,861 --> 00:36:05,730
whole, you know, pissed
off at me as I went out.

560
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:10,470
People like Danny Sullivan,
you know the race car driver.

561
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:14,700
I said Oh yeah, Danny smokes pot
and people got mad at you for that.

562
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,040
All went nuts.

563
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:22,041
I think that's why I got busted because
I was in Saint Louis on a radio show

564
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,000
that ash crop listened to.

565
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:29,630
And I think Ashkar I've heard me and the
hit window people forgot how crazy that

566
00:36:31,501 --> 00:36:35,130
guy is still alive.
That's a good question.

567
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:37,410
But do you remember when he was singing?

568
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:42,510
He had a song that he sang that he
wrote about let the eagles soar.

569
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,760
This is when,
yes,

570
00:36:44,761 --> 00:36:49,761
when he was attorney general and it was
so creepy and crazy that this person

571
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:55,320
would say he had a whole album of of
Gospel music. Like he was us. Sigh.

572
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,550
Oh,
it was,

573
00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:00,630
I would love to climb inside that guy's
head and find out what kind of gears are

574
00:37:00,631 --> 00:37:02,890
spinning around in there.
I think I did.

575
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:07,530
I think I ended up in jail
for my pro forma thing.

576
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:11,800
Yeah. He had a whole song that he sang on
television. He said, I think he sang. It

577
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:18,420
was either front of Congress or something
along those lines where he know he was

578
00:37:18,421 --> 00:37:22,450
giving a speech somewhere and then along
with the speech he wanted to sing the

579
00:37:22,451 --> 00:37:22,861
song,

580
00:37:22,861 --> 00:37:27,740
let the eagles soar like
she's never sword before.

581
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:32,070
It's so they want to hear it save you
fight at Jamie. It's, it's so bad.

582
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,990
10 seconds from a daily show moment
of Zen that they did with it.

583
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:40,360
Well this is a v the video
is that video look shitty.

584
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,200
This is the clearest for you.
I could fuck it up quick.

585
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:45,280
It's just 10 seconds of it. Okay. Here's
the, here's the video. Look at this.

586
00:37:45,281 --> 00:37:46,420
Check this out.
Look up there.

587
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,000
Oh,

588
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:56,190
like she is never slow.

589
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:58,400
Ooh.

590
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:03,170
From a rocky coast stop. That's
all you need to see. Like stop.

591
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:05,750
You can't nothing forever,
Bro.

592
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:11,960
Nobody knew. That's when you kind of
see. Yeah, maybe guns or, okay, yeah,

593
00:38:11,961 --> 00:38:16,430
maybe everything's fine. Maybe
missiles, but seeing the guy like that,

594
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:21,490
thinking that that psychopath had any
control whatsoever over any laws or anyone

595
00:38:22,161 --> 00:38:24,110
getting arrested.
That guy is fucking insane.

596
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:28,880
He's the guy who was wanting to cover
the breasts on statutes. Yes. Yeah. Hey,

597
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,050
did which broad tension to
them? Yeah. No one noticed it.

598
00:38:32,051 --> 00:38:36,070
Titch before he put a veil
over. Exactly. Then now they're

599
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:40,910
looking at the RUC as titties. He was a
spooky guy and he was your wallet. Yeah.

600
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:44,470
I found out over Bush administration
had some spooky fucking people there.

601
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,491
They really did.

602
00:38:45,491 --> 00:38:49,390
It's really interesting that history
whitewashes these weird old guys. Yeah,

603
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:51,460
like Ronald Reagan.
After he died,

604
00:38:51,461 --> 00:38:54,490
Ronald Reagan became like this patron
saint of conservative thinking.

605
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,140
When I was in highschool,

606
00:38:56,410 --> 00:39:00,220
Ronald Reagan was president and everybody
fucking hated that. They hated them.

607
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:04,240
It was like he was a creep thought
about, I'm like, this guy's a fraud.

608
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:08,890
He's a phony. He's lying about selling
arms to Iran. The whole thing was,

609
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,700
it was, it was so crazy to watch
that guy become this loved figure.

610
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,390
I used to work out with his daughter,
Patty Raelynn,

611
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:20,880
and her and I were pretty good friends
until one day it came to the gym and I

612
00:39:22,331 --> 00:39:27,130
saw part of a movie called Colliculi Leah.
And she said,

613
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:32,230
oh, how did you like it? I said, I was
too faggy for me. And apparently Ron,

614
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:37,090
her brother, her brother's very gay
and she blew it. She, oh, up at me.

615
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:42,190
How do, how can you say that? How dare
you, don't, you know my brother. And

616
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:48,720
Yeah. So it's nothing to
do with the movie, just,

617
00:39:48,721 --> 00:39:51,640
you know, I'm not into that and that's
okay. I just don't like watching it.

618
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,930
It doesn't mean I don't want you
to do it. That's funny. Yeah.

619
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:59,170
Ron was like super hardcore
Democrat, right. And son it was,

620
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:04,010
that was an interesting little thing.
Yeah. So that his son was gay. Uh,

621
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:07,690
Ronnie was, wasn't that
right wing and until, uh,

622
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:12,040
until he found a better path for
him. Like Trump. Yeah. He was, uh,

623
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:16,610
Ronnie was a Democrat like
Trump. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He
was when he was younger. Yeah.

624
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:19,360
See when they get older, you know,
then that's, that always happens.

625
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:20,840
All sell your share. Annoyed. Yes.

626
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:23,600
They also get paranoid and they start
wanting to tighten up the borders and

627
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,063
walking load.

628
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:30,620
Let the [inaudible]
she's never saw before.

629
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:36,220
And imagine like sitting down,
writing that out and then,

630
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,240
and then singing it with all that
emotion and passion as if that makes any

631
00:40:40,241 --> 00:40:44,410
fucking sense to animal. Well,
obviously no, there was no

632
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,180
stopping him. You know,
he's a fucking moron.

633
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:54,130
And the song's about a bird that's
an evil repped like a raptor.

634
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,300
Like any eagle was a fucking
monstrous animal will eat babies,

635
00:40:58,301 --> 00:41:00,040
they'll eat anything they
can get their hands on.

636
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:04,300
They swooped down and snatched fish, ran
a fucking river. They're fun. I mean,

637
00:41:04,301 --> 00:41:08,680
they're amazing creatures. I don't hate
eagles, but the idea that that's America,

638
00:41:08,681 --> 00:41:13,060
America is a fucking vicious flying
dinosaur. It's kind of hilarious.

639
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:18,230
It really is kind of hilarious.
That's our animal. Uh, funny. No,

640
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:22,300
I pissed off a lot of people and you know,
yeah.

641
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:27,040
Not Meaning to say, you know, we used
to say when they would attack us,

642
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:29,020
you know,
what if we're right,

643
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,800
what if everything we're doing
is right and you're wrong.

644
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:36,320
And next thing you know it's
true. We were right. Yeah.

645
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:38,870
But you were right the whole
time. Yeah. And you know,

646
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:42,200
I remember when I first started
smoking weed, I was, well,

647
00:41:42,201 --> 00:41:46,490
I had smoked it a couple of times up
until I was 30 and then when I was 30,

648
00:41:46,491 --> 00:41:49,730
my friend Eddie, Eddie Bravo got me
high for the first time. I remember,

649
00:41:49,731 --> 00:41:53,510
I couldn't believe that this was
what pot was. I was like, this is it.

650
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:57,230
I thought it made you stupid. I call, I
can't stop thinking about things like,

651
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:00,590
yeah, some of the thoughts are a little
on the organized and kind of chaotic,

652
00:42:00,591 --> 00:42:03,470
but it wasn't making me lazy.

653
00:42:03,471 --> 00:42:05,870
It wasn't doing any of these things
that people were claiming it did,

654
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:08,600
didn't make me stupid.
It made me curious. Yeah.

655
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:12,230
Made me want to watch science
documentaries and eat. Yeah,

656
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:17,230
and dance and eat and it tasted so good.
I can't believe I'm good.

657
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:19,430
This food tastes,
I know it's just to,

658
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:24,640
it is one of the biggest puzzles of
modern times is that even in 2019 with all

659
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:27,350
these states that have legalized it,

660
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:31,460
there's still a bunch of people that
think that pot is bad for you and then it

661
00:42:31,461 --> 00:42:35,240
makes you lazy. And I always say
that pot is like any other tool.

662
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:36,470
It's like a hammer.

663
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,470
You could build a house with a hammer
or you can just hit yourself in the Dick

664
00:42:39,471 --> 00:42:40,310
if you're fucking crazy.

665
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:44,240
And it's the same thing with pot that's
exactly can use pot and you can enhance

666
00:42:44,241 --> 00:42:48,290
your life and it can enhance
your relationship and it
makes you friendlier and

667
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:51,290
more calm, more comradery,
more compassion.

668
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:54,110
Or You could just get stoned
all day and do nothing.

669
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:58,370
You got that Goddamn phone ringing on
your roof. Does that freak you out?

670
00:42:58,371 --> 00:43:00,770
Have Enough? I had one of those on
my breasts for a day and I was like,

671
00:43:00,771 --> 00:43:03,200
what am I doing? I don't, I
don't know how to work it,

672
00:43:03,201 --> 00:43:04,820
so it's just decoration for me.

673
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,450
Why do I have a regular watch?

674
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:13,130
That funny saying that your son got
up before me. There's various. Got It.

675
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:16,590
Because he, he updates my
everything. Oh, okay. Okay.

676
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:21,230
If it wasn't for parasites and still
be you riding a bike. Yeah. I don't,

677
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:21,800
I don't,

678
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,670
I had one of those that I was using for
a while for like fitness tracking stuff.

679
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:26,690
Then I got this,
whoop,

680
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:31,310
I got this other thing that's quite a
bit more accurate and does more stuff.

681
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:36,570
You're 51 51. Yeah. Good
shape, man. Thank you. Dumb,

682
00:43:36,571 --> 00:43:37,670
scared.
Never let it go.

683
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:41,860
I work on all the time because I'm
terrified of it falling apart. Well, no,

684
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,910
you're hooked on the adrenaline and you're
hooked on the endorphins, friendship.

685
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:49,370
But yeah, with that too, it's also for
mental health reasons. Like for me,

686
00:43:49,371 --> 00:43:53,040
I need to, oh, I got a size, well,
like Arnold, you know, when I,

687
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,700
when I first came to La, I, I uh,

688
00:43:56,540 --> 00:44:01,440
personally I did was join the Gold's
gym cause I read about it, you know,

689
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:06,680
in Vancouver. And then I met Arnold
and all the, all the guys in there,

690
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:11,210
there were so healthy, you know,
if he took a sip of seven up,

691
00:44:11,211 --> 00:44:15,440
you'd spit it out. Really? Yeah.
And he was a super, super healthy,

692
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,640
but he smoked a joint. He was smoking
a joint. That was another thing,

693
00:44:19,641 --> 00:44:23,640
pumping iron. That documentary palm
parents saw him after he won. Yes.

694
00:44:23,641 --> 00:44:24,474
Smoking a joint.

695
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:29,640
I made the pot look like, wow, this guy
smoked pot. Right. How the fuck is pop?

696
00:44:29,641 --> 00:44:32,040
Make you a loser if the
biggest body builder

697
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:36,270
on the planet, the most successful
yes. Six far guy. Yeah. Yeah.

698
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:39,720
I owed him one time,
like I owed everybody and,

699
00:44:39,721 --> 00:44:44,721
and Arnold was walking was Stallone at
the time and there's that famous picture.

700
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:49,380
Yeah, they ass this numero uno.
They asked Arnold, uh, you know,

701
00:44:49,381 --> 00:44:53,820
Tommy Chong said that he smoked pot with
you and Stallone jumped in right away

702
00:44:53,821 --> 00:44:57,960
or no, that's a lie. That's
a lie. You ain't never smoked
in order, so no, no. Yeah,

703
00:44:57,961 --> 00:45:01,180
we did smoke, but we knew how
to enjoy ourselves back then.

704
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:06,450
The loan, I'm trying to cover it up
while he can still own this, to the loan.

705
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:09,690
Those Rambo movies. Oh, I got
some good stories on Stallone.

706
00:45:09,691 --> 00:45:14,100
But you don't remember Jordan Belfort?
Jordan Belfort,

707
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:18,350
the wolf of Wall Street? Yes.
Yeah, I was in jail with him. Oh,

708
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:22,170
I helped him write his book.
Really? Yeah. In fact we're,

709
00:45:22,171 --> 00:45:27,171
all I did was insult him and made him
write his book cause I was reading my book

710
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,180
and he was started, he said,
what are you doing and writing,

711
00:45:30,181 --> 00:45:33,810
cause we shared a cubicle and I said,
I'm ready. My book. He says, Oh,

712
00:45:33,811 --> 00:45:34,621
I'm going to write a book.

713
00:45:34,621 --> 00:45:38,160
And so he wrote a couple of pages and
he handed it to me like, Hey, read this,

714
00:45:38,161 --> 00:45:42,900
you know, and it read it and it was
like a copy of Tom Wolfe, you know,

715
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:46,830
bonfires in the manatees. And I
said, you haven't written shit.

716
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:50,430
Handed it back to him. And
he says, what do you mean I

717
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:56,640
haven't written nothing. He said, what
should I write? You challenged me. I said,

718
00:45:56,641 --> 00:45:59,430
write what you know. I says, right.

719
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:01,740
Those stories you've been
telling me or be night, you know,

720
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:04,920
he said there's one rule that you've
got to remember when you're writing or

721
00:46:04,921 --> 00:46:09,360
doing anything,
it's called the most of so you don't get,

722
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,100
you don't just get high,

723
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,820
you get higher than anybody's
ever gotten in their life.

724
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:18,060
If you're going to put it on screen,
you know, you don't just have a fight,

725
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:21,510
you have a fight that goes
on forever, you know, that's,

726
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:24,270
that's the kind of stuff you need
that people are interested in.

727
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:29,550
And so he said you didn't talk to me for
both but a month after that and he was

728
00:46:29,551 --> 00:46:32,390
mad at you. Yeah. He was just
right now shoulder scar and he,

729
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:35,670
and he wrote the wolf of
Wall Street. Well, yeah.

730
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:38,640
And then he give it to you in the like,
all right, you got something here? No, no,

731
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:41,730
no, no, no. The last time,
the next time I saw him,

732
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,490
he pulled in front of
my house with his car.

733
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:47,460
We were both on probation so
we couldn't talk to each other.

734
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:51,420
And so he yelled from his car.
He goes, Hey, I sold them,

735
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:54,570
sold the book to a Martin Scorsese.

736
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:57,150
So you're allowed to talk to
each other by yelling. Yeah.

737
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:00,330
But you couldn't be close. Yeah. You
couldn't be close. Did you have to,

738
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,420
how far away do you have to stay loud?
You know,

739
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:05,340
technically you're not supposed to
talk to each other, you know, but,

740
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:09,950
but yelling there, no one's
gonna say anything about
this. Hilarious. Yeah, no, no,

741
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,970
you can,
you violate your probation.

742
00:47:11,971 --> 00:47:14,760
They put you back in jail because you're
associating with felons. That's right.

743
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:15,600
Right.
That's,

744
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:19,250
that's so crazy that someone who
you're trying to rehabilitate with. No,

745
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,990
you can't talk to them
because they also fucked up.

746
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:26,040
There was a Nixon speech writer that was
in with me and he was so innocent and

747
00:47:26,041 --> 00:47:26,391
they want,

748
00:47:26,391 --> 00:47:31,391
and what the government was trying
to get stuff on Amelda Marcos in the

749
00:47:32,171 --> 00:47:36,290
Philippines and this lawyer that I
was in there with a speech writer,

750
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:38,890
a Reagan speech writer,
and,

751
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:43,390
and he wouldn't give up Marcos or Amelda.

752
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:48,220
And so they put him in jail for a year.
And when he got out on probation,

753
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:52,960
being a straight guy, he was, he went
home and took a Valium to help him sleep.

754
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:58,610
And he got drug test at the next day.
He went back in jail. He wouldn't,

755
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:00,890
he went back baggage Joe.

756
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:04,690
So you've gotta be very careful when
you're dealing with probation people cause

757
00:48:04,691 --> 00:48:06,970
they got you by the
balls. Man. I had such a,

758
00:48:06,971 --> 00:48:10,030
it's gotta be a weird thing dealing with
the probation officers cause they have

759
00:48:10,031 --> 00:48:13,630
that power on you. Did
they fuck with you? Not me.

760
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:18,870
I was too much of a celebrity and I had
a lot of Nice ladies and so I'd flirt

761
00:48:19,151 --> 00:48:23,860
with him. And you know, friends. Yeah,
service area thing. [inaudible] I'm sure.

762
00:48:23,861 --> 00:48:26,800
Like all things right. There's good
people doing it and bad. Oh yeah. Yeah.

763
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,070
It's a job. It's a job.
It's a paycheck. You know,

764
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:36,030
the sad thing about when I was in jail
at Taft was that it's built over a toxic

765
00:48:36,971 --> 00:48:39,130
waste dump where they used to,

766
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,910
that's where they found
oil in tab in California.

767
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:47,410
And when they found oil back in the day,
they never had a way to contain it.

768
00:48:47,411 --> 00:48:51,820
They would just dig it, he hit it and it
would just spilled all over the ground.

769
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:57,000
And so they would dig big trenches out
big pools and they would fill up with

770
00:48:57,041 --> 00:49:00,940
oil. Then they would get the
barrels and dip the barrels in.

771
00:49:00,941 --> 00:49:03,970
And that's how they filled
up the oil barrels. And,

772
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:07,900
and so after the figuring out
how to do it right, they, uh,

773
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:10,660
the ground is all toxic.

774
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:13,840
And so they built a federal
prison over top of it.

775
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:18,190
And so everybody that's worked there
and a lot of people that did time,

776
00:49:18,191 --> 00:49:20,560
they're all gotten cancer and died.

777
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:25,570
So he think that's probably the root of
your cancer? Could be. Could be. Could be.

778
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:28,600
He's sure. Yeah. Easy. Yeah.
Cause that's where I got it.

779
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:32,230
And they say that marijuana
does something to cancer, right?

780
00:49:32,231 --> 00:49:36,130
Inhibits cancer in certain ways.
I don't know technically what it does.

781
00:49:36,131 --> 00:49:38,380
I think what it does more than anything,

782
00:49:38,381 --> 00:49:42,760
it calms the brain seeing
anytime you calm the brain,

783
00:49:42,761 --> 00:49:45,440
you lose a fear.
So you know,

784
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:50,110
the fear is that fight or flight,
you know, that's your response.

785
00:49:50,111 --> 00:49:52,330
Your body goes into this
fight or flight mode.

786
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:57,490
And when you calm that down,
your body just goes into relaxation mode.

787
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:00,420
And when you're in the
fight or flight mode, uh,

788
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:02,680
the other parts of your body can't,

789
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,800
can't function properly
like your immune system.

790
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:10,270
But when you're totally relaxed mode,
that's why when a animal gets hurt,

791
00:50:10,271 --> 00:50:13,460
they usually just crawl off in a corner
somewhere and just lay there and lick

792
00:50:13,461 --> 00:50:17,350
their wounds and they
just calm everything down.

793
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:19,750
And then they let the
body take over to heal.

794
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,920
And I think what happens with pod is it,

795
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:26,560
it mellows the brain to the point where
you, yeah, so what you know, and you,

796
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:29,960
you allow your body to take over,

797
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:34,280
but you still need that other treatments.
You still need the chemo,

798
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:37,280
the radiation, you need
all that stuff, you know?

799
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:41,270
Are you taking CBD oil now? Yeah.
Oh yeah. Yeah. How much do you take?

800
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:46,470
I'm not sure. I'm not good at that
amount. You know. [inaudible] good.

801
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:51,290
I take it, I have it right now.
I'm on testosterone and uh,

802
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:55,910
and CBD. Yeah. And then
just power, you know,

803
00:50:55,970 --> 00:51:00,680
smoke up over a couple of joints or we've
got a, we've got a gift bag for you.

804
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:03,170
Yes. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you.

805
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:08,530
Thank you. So he's going to
have it. I got some for be real.

806
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:12,780
It scared the shit out of me. I
did be real smoke box. Oh yeah.

807
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,100
Be Real from Cypress. Yeah, I know.

808
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:17,420
But that's probably as high as
I've ever been in my life. Really.

809
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,310
Those guys go hard. Oh yeah. I
couldn't keep up with him. No, no.

810
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:24,430
I don't even try.
I'm a lightweight man.

811
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:28,450
When I spoke with Arnold Wa,
all Dave draper,

812
00:51:28,451 --> 00:51:31,210
all these muscle heads would come
around and they get a big bong.

813
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,170
And the thing was they put like a,
like a,

814
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:39,180
an ounce in the bowl and then they'd
fired up and then they suck on it so hard.

815
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:43,570
Whoever exploded the bowl into the,

816
00:51:43,571 --> 00:51:48,020
into the water made it explode.
Then you are the hero. It's, uh,

817
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,650
all the, all the muscle ads
there, they're taking their hit.

818
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:54,400
Arnold takes a big hit, you know, the
thing explodes. Then they handed to me.

819
00:51:54,401 --> 00:51:55,234
It was like,

820
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:01,510
they looked at me like no
with the Chong at the time.

821
00:52:01,511 --> 00:52:05,580
So they just looked at me like, yeah,
okay, go sell where there's Dan.

822
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:09,820
You were just a guy. Yeah, I was
just winning. Almost faceless.

823
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:14,910
What was it like being famous for
being a pothead back in the 70s?

824
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:18,400
Cause that'd be weird as you were,
you were,

825
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:23,430
you and Cheech were famous potheads where
I don't think there was anybody else.

826
00:52:24,071 --> 00:52:28,030
Like who else was a famous
pot at no water level?

827
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:32,050
Uh, no, no one, not, no one ever

828
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:38,290
spares. Same, uh, the actor.

829
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,910
Oh Christ. I can't think
of his name. He did time.

830
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:48,460
He did a year in jail in county
for one joint. Robert Mitchum.

831
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:53,140
Oh yeah, Albert Michonne. But he was like
a straight laced guy. Yeah. The image.

832
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:57,760
Big Cowboy. Yeah. Yeah. He got high. He
lived to tough guy that does the image.

833
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:01,180
Well, you know what the big, the big, uh,

834
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:06,690
draw for pot was the sex.
See it?

835
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:11,320
Uh, it was, it was before, what
do you call the supers are,

836
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:15,060
uh, so parkway Lids, you know,

837
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:18,800

lewd was big sex things that was a,

838
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,990
people would have sex on
Queloz. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

839
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:24,690
I've never taken it quite a bit.
What does it do for you? Oh, just it,

840
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:25,553
they're called

841
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:30,840
when a girl gets high on, on, on
a coil. Ludas like take me. Yeah.

842
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:34,830
Do you think that's why bill Cosby was
the girls will quote? Totally. Totally.

843
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:39,150
So that was the thing that just relaxes
you and it makes you horny, really?

844
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:42,600
Oh yeah.
And that's what pot does for me now,

845
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:47,400
but it does for people, for women,
Women Loeb do sleep with that.

846
00:53:47,401 --> 00:53:51,060
And they loved to have a six,
you know, after smoking a joint,

847
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:55,350
where was Annie Hall was in
Annie Hall with woody. Xy End.

848
00:53:55,351 --> 00:53:56,370
He got a little pissed off.

849
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,420
Do you have to get high every
time you make love with me?
Yeah. All that sobriety,

850
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:03,240
is that any hall?
I think it was Annie Hall and I think,

851
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:06,960
I think everybody in the picture, the
movie company, the Movio said yeah,

852
00:54:06,961 --> 00:54:10,370
I could dig it.
Yeah.

853
00:54:10,371 --> 00:54:14,740
It definitely changes the way things
feel. Yeah. Relaxes. Yeah. Axis.

854
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:19,710
You hear music so you feel things better.
Everything feels nice here. You know,

855
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:23,820
I like to do yoga on it. I like to smoke
weed right before I go to yoga class.

856
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:25,500
Yeah. That's amazing. Yeah.

857
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:30,510
I feel all the muscles filling all the
tiny ones and the ones connected to your

858
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:33,450
spots and you don't smoke a lot.

859
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:37,200
Or do you a couple of talks or before
yoga class? I don't want it too high.

860
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:40,850
I'll just be inside my head. Yeah. I
just wanted like two heads just hits.

861
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,700
Just going, hi, I'm high,
but I'm not blasted. Yeah,

862
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,850
that's me too.
I got a,

863
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:52,500
I've been giving all sorts of toys, you
know, cause I got the Chungs choice.

864
00:54:52,501 --> 00:54:55,260
We in the stores in the,
and so the,

865
00:54:55,710 --> 00:55:00,530
I'm getting tons of pipes all the time
and I make pipes to in fact that that's

866
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:05,160
the not a pipe. This is another one of
those. I you go last I got one of the,

867
00:55:05,161 --> 00:55:09,240
okay, last time was like six,
whatever it was six years ago.

868
00:55:09,241 --> 00:55:12,240
Last time you were on the show. Yeah,
he gave me the nod of pipe. Oh good.

869
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:16,590
I got it at home but I, you
know, so, so now they got,

870
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:20,850
they got a new one.
Can't think of it.

871
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:24,970
I got it for you here and
you go, oh great. Thank you.
It's called easy pipe. Oh,

872
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:25,853
okay.
Easy.

873
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:30,720
But it's so cool because you open the
thing and it's got a lighter built in and

874
00:55:30,721 --> 00:55:31,670
there's a,
just a,

875
00:55:31,671 --> 00:55:36,671
a enough doubles holds enough for a
little nugget but nugget in there and you

876
00:55:37,021 --> 00:55:40,890
can carry it in your pocket cause there's
a lid and then when you're one on one

877
00:55:40,891 --> 00:55:42,690
a hit it,
you just hit the later,

878
00:55:43,150 --> 00:55:47,700
you got to hit Ah,
one of those before.

879
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:51,650
And I was like a little metal lid.
Slides over to the side. Yeah,

880
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:55,920
those are pretty cool. Oh yeah. They're
very nice. Yeah. Nice little contraption.

881
00:55:55,921 --> 00:55:58,660
All contained. Well, the old ones,

882
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:03,540
hitters used to be chunks choice right
there. Compile yet. That's a challenge.

883
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:08,570
Oh, that's the different thing
about the genius pipe. Ah, yes.

884
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:14,010
Incredible. Incredible. What does
that do? Well, it cools the smoke.

885
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:17,460
She from the bowl to the,

886
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,220
to the mouthpiece is the most piece.

887
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:25,210
The whole thing is, is, is dimpled inside.

888
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:29,500
And so the smoke goes through all
this, the dimples and cools. It.

889
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:34,330
Cools it off. You sorta like
ice water and a bong. Yeah.
Yeah. Better. Better, better.

890
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:38,560
Oh it's, it's so smooth now. I'll
cough it. Just thinking about it.

891
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:42,460
But you do the genius pipe
and it's just so cool.

892
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,420
Do you get all these kids that are
Dabbin and using wax and I watch,

893
00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:49,210
do you ever go to Cypress hills?
Instagram page? I get fucking,

894
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:53,360
I get anxiety just watching their videos.
Like how high you get in,

895
00:56:54,030 --> 00:56:56,420
cause they play.
I want to get high.

896
00:56:57,950 --> 00:57:01,900
So high. And you're watching the
video and you're like, oh my God,

897
00:57:01,901 --> 00:57:05,390
I can't do this. I can't
even watch this. I know.

898
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:09,790
Scooping that yellow wax in there and
you know, they go, they go so deep.

899
00:57:09,791 --> 00:57:10,750
These kids today,

900
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:14,710
none of their fucking mind are heating
up glass and dropping the THC into the

901
00:57:14,711 --> 00:57:19,450
glass. Like I was at one when dispensary
tree and the guy was so proud,

902
00:57:19,451 --> 00:57:23,390
he handed me a big jar of shatter,
you know,

903
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:27,850
the stuff in. I pretended
like, oh, it's a gift. Oh,

904
00:57:27,851 --> 00:57:31,540
things and put in those bugs in her,
walked away.

905
00:57:31,730 --> 00:57:34,650
The guy is both of truck.

906
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:37,430
That was probably a lot of money
through that stuff or lose.

907
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:40,540
It was like a year's worth of debt.
Oh my God.

908
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:43,850
And I kept it long enough to
make him nervous. And then,

909
00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:48,680
you know,
with Canada we had

910
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:52,600
deal with hash a lot. Uh, and it's okay,

911
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:56,890
but it's a little bit too
harsh. Caches. Harsh. Yeah.

912
00:57:57,610 --> 00:58:02,130
The highs. Interesting though. Yeah.
Yeah. It's a, it's an intense high. Yeah.

913
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:06,370
What do you, how do you feel about
edibles? I love him to sleep on.

914
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,830
I love the chocolate.

915
00:58:08,831 --> 00:58:13,300
I got you is what my wife and I both use.

916
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:14,733
Oh yeah.

917
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:19,450
We'll wake up in the middle of the night
instead of fussing and fighting or you

918
00:58:19,451 --> 00:58:21,910
know,
thinking about it.

919
00:58:21,911 --> 00:58:25,610
We just go and get a little
little chocolate thing.

920
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,400
It's delicious chocolate too.

921
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:33,060
It's deficiency chocolate in it's
suppressing and you just sleep.

922
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:35,470
Not only I slept last night,

923
00:58:35,471 --> 00:58:39,880
but I had a couple of them pivot
epiphanies that just blew my mind.

924
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:43,780
And how art is going to save the world.

925
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:47,200
Art is considered the world.
Yeah. How's that? Well,

926
00:58:47,201 --> 00:58:51,190
you look at history like the pyramids,
that was art.

927
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:54,430
That was an art piece.
And what happens when you,

928
00:58:54,431 --> 00:58:56,770
when you have big huge
art pieces like that,

929
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:01,030
you create employment and it's not war.
So you're not fighting,

930
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:05,800
you're creating. And so
the people that, that uh,

931
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:09,370
share for the animals,
the people that have to feed the,

932
00:59:09,410 --> 00:59:13,990
the mass of people that have to work on
getting those rocks, carbon, those rocks,

933
00:59:13,991 --> 00:59:18,190
everything else, it creates employment
in, it also creates tourism.

934
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:22,040
And so you, when you have
piece of art, everybody

935
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:26,360
wants to come and look at it. And so
that's what we need in the world today.

936
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:31,010
You see? And we not only need art, but we
need functional art because that's what,

937
00:59:31,011 --> 00:59:35,720
uh, the pyramids were. They
were functional and a lot
of people think it was the,

938
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:39,860
uh, the astronauts in
aliens. Aliens, which,

939
00:59:39,861 --> 00:59:44,540
which could very well be. Yeah. Really
think so. Oh sure. For sure. For sure.

940
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:49,730
Why do you think that? Why? Because
there's nothing new in the universe.

941
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:54,680
You know? [inaudible] we've had space
flights. We've had all that stuff forever.

942
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:58,070
But you have Tom's choice. Cooler
pipe. Yeah. That genius pipe.

943
00:59:58,071 --> 01:00:01,640
That's a new in the universe. That's,
that's, no, that's probably rehashed.

944
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:06,700
I was somewhere and Rehab someone.
Yeah. So, no. So in the University, oh,

945
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:10,940
you talk about,
or you want to talk about pot to Chinese,

946
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:13,540
Indian shorts, all, all religions.

947
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:17,060
What makes you think that aliens built
the parents though? I kind of same.

948
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:20,750
They could have been really,
I think aliens are just humans.

949
01:00:20,751 --> 01:00:24,500
You know that because if they're
wearing space suits, they're aliens.

950
01:00:24,501 --> 01:00:29,450
Why did they need a space suit on
this? He did come from another, uh, uh,

951
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:30,410
atmosphere.

952
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:35,000
I personally believe that earth is
the only planet in this universe.

953
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:40,250
And the reason I believe that is that
there are countless universities like

954
01:00:40,251 --> 01:00:43,850
spaces endless.
And so spaces in this why,

955
01:00:43,851 --> 01:00:47,450
why wouldn't we have our own universe?
Okay.

956
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:52,100
So you think that earth is the
only planet in this universe? Yes.

957
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:56,210
But what about Mars? Oh,
that's a dead planet. Okay.

958
01:00:56,211 --> 01:00:57,860
So earth is the only live planning.

959
01:00:57,890 --> 01:01:00,410
The only time with life in
this whole universe. Yeah.

960
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:05,690
So you think that there's multiple
universes are infinite numbers of

961
01:01:05,691 --> 01:01:10,670
universities in each universe
probably has an earth or too or too.

962
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:14,180
But you think this whole universe of
hundreds of billions of galaxies. Yeah,

963
01:01:14,181 --> 01:01:16,760
it's with hundreds of
billions of solar systems.

964
01:01:16,850 --> 01:01:20,980
Could be there's only one planet. Could
be. Cause we have the space. So the only,

965
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:25,600
you mean by one planet. One planet with
life. Yes, but we're intelligent life.

966
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:28,370
But why wouldn't you think that there's,
cause it's so big.

967
01:01:28,371 --> 01:01:31,430
Why wouldn't you think that there could
possibly be other life, other places?

968
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:36,380
Why couldn't it be the other
way? Why couldn't we be the
only ones that could be?

969
01:01:36,770 --> 01:01:40,790
That's what I'm saying. We totally could
be so, so there's no reason for me. See,

970
01:01:40,850 --> 01:01:45,740
see, that's the way I have trouble with
people that are afraid of Ai. You know,

971
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:50,020
artificial intelligence. Yeah.
I think so silly because why?

972
01:01:50,030 --> 01:01:51,920
Because they're smart.

973
01:01:52,430 --> 01:01:56,300
They're smart enough to know that
they're not going to him slave anybody or

974
01:01:56,360 --> 01:02:01,340
torture anybody or take over anything.
Not only dummies, do that stuff,

975
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:04,520
you know? Because when you
capture something, you know what?

976
01:02:04,521 --> 01:02:09,200
You capture their problems,
whatever their problems are,

977
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:13,250
US extinguish them. Yeah.
For what reason? Well,

978
01:02:13,251 --> 01:02:16,400
that people are just destroying the earth.
They're polluting the rivers.

979
01:02:16,401 --> 01:02:18,860
They're sucking all the fish
out of the sea. It's not,

980
01:02:18,861 --> 01:02:20,550
the guy's filled with carbon

981
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:23,010
there. The artificial lives
can be like, you know what?

982
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:26,340
The real problems he's gotten them people,
their dirty little litters.

983
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,260
They're choking squirrel.

984
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:32,820
See, that's the paranoid. Look at
it. Look at the positive again.

985
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:36,330
What's the positive? Well, first
of all, you have to remember,

986
01:02:36,331 --> 01:02:39,030
we live in a physical universe.
Okay?

987
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:44,460
For every action there's a reaction.
So for every good,

988
01:02:44,461 --> 01:02:45,420
there's a bad,

989
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:50,430
nothing explains Trump more than
for every Obama, there's a Trump,

990
01:02:51,150 --> 01:02:52,470
you know what I'm saying?
Okay.

991
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:57,920
So there's no limit to how ignorant you
can be and there's no limit to how smart

992
01:02:58,651 --> 01:03:00,150
you can be.
There's no limit.

993
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:05,130
And so when you go up the
skill intelligence skill,

994
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:06,150
then,

995
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:11,150
then you realize that there's no reason
to be paranoid about anything because

996
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:16,790
it's all written out. I know all the
holy books written it out, you know,

997
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,630
especially the Bible.

998
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:24,080
See the Bible has been misconstrued by
so many people because what they do,

999
01:03:24,121 --> 01:03:27,990
they'd take it to what's going
to suit their purposes and that,

1000
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:31,920
but to really interpret the Bible,
it's written in code.

1001
01:03:32,790 --> 01:03:37,560
It's written. It's a secret code
of, yeah, it's metaphysical terms.

1002
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:40,440
It's not physical terms
of metaphysical terms.

1003
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,430
What do you know about the
Bible and cold look wouldn't,

1004
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:47,130
there's a writer called Emmet
Fox should get into him.

1005
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,860
Yeah, he, he deciphers the whole Bible.

1006
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:53,600
Does he decipher the ancient
Hebrew version of the Bible
or the Greek version of

1007
01:03:53,601 --> 01:03:57,320
the Bible? Latin verse in the Bible.
All the versions. Right. But I mean,

1008
01:03:57,321 --> 01:03:58,940
it all comes from ancient Hebrew.

1009
01:03:58,941 --> 01:04:02,810
And when you translate things from
ancient Hebrew, this ancient Hebrew,

1010
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:05,150
the letters also double as numbers.
Sure.

1011
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:10,220
And, and, and, and see. See w w w
the people I read, there's another

1012
01:04:12,050 --> 01:04:16,070
mistake that I read a lot.
Mystic, mystic, you know,

1013
01:04:16,071 --> 01:04:19,080
or you know,
he's not he,

1014
01:04:19,081 --> 01:04:21,590
but his name is Joel s Goldsmith.

1015
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:26,750
I discovered him a long time ago,
but I discovered him in jail.

1016
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:31,220
It's a very popular book in jail and
Goldsmith look him up. He's all on the,

1017
01:04:31,221 --> 01:04:34,970
on the computers and everything
else. Check him out. You'll really,

1018
01:04:34,971 --> 01:04:39,040
really enjoy it. It'll give me a
new perspective because what he,

1019
01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:43,580
he maintains, it's all written
in, like I say in the Bible,

1020
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:47,330
eternity. Let's see. There's
no beginning and no end.

1021
01:04:47,990 --> 01:04:52,990
That explains everything to me because
if there's no beginning and to know and

1022
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:58,520
what can,
what can happen will happen.

1023
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:04,910
You know?
And because this,

1024
01:05:05,390 --> 01:05:09,020
again, this is my, my, my
theory is in the physical world,

1025
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:12,530
we have to learn everything.
That's why everything's physical.

1026
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:15,770
Like the first thing when you're born,
you have to learn how to breathe.

1027
01:05:16,150 --> 01:05:20,880
You have to learn how to, you
have to learn how to eat. The,

1028
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:25,530
these are all skills that you have to
literally learn and mothers and everything

1029
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:30,260
teach you you that. And then
when you reach a certain age, uh,

1030
01:05:30,610 --> 01:05:34,390
you leave the planet, you know,
they're at least your soul,

1031
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:38,950
your spirit and the body, the body
stays. But it's just a vehicle.

1032
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,550
And so because of eternity,

1033
01:05:42,970 --> 01:05:46,690
this goes on and on and on and on forever.
It never stops.

1034
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:52,420
What we do as humans, we're learning.
We're, we're creatures of we're,

1035
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:56,490
we're all students whether we
want to be or not. You know, I,

1036
01:05:56,500 --> 01:06:01,210
I was trying to explain this to my one
side because my youngest son is a bit,

1037
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:04,210
he's a musician, you know, and, and I,

1038
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:08,320
and I try to understand that he's
a musician and, uh, you know,

1039
01:06:08,321 --> 01:06:10,960
musicians aren't that, uh, you know,

1040
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:15,610
they're not as entrepreneurial as as
some people would like them to be.

1041
01:06:16,090 --> 01:06:20,320
But anyway,
everybody's here to learn a certain task.

1042
01:06:21,490 --> 01:06:25,750
And some of us are blessed to
the point. Like me, I'm blessed.

1043
01:06:25,751 --> 01:06:28,170
I'm very blessed because,
uh,

1044
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:33,360
I've been given the ability to do what
I do and to see what I see and to say

1045
01:06:35,501 --> 01:06:39,640
what I say. You know, it doesn't come
from me. It comes from, you know,

1046
01:06:40,190 --> 01:06:43,030
the source,
what I call the source.

1047
01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:48,630
And that's why I could turn prison into
a religious retreat because it's like a

1048
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:55,420
monk going, you know, into
hiatus for, for nine months.

1049
01:06:55,490 --> 01:06:58,630
You just had a thought in your head
that you're going to treat it like a

1050
01:06:58,631 --> 01:07:02,530
religious retreat and you'd learn
about yourself and educate yourself,

1051
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:03,633
read all the books,

1052
01:07:03,650 --> 01:07:08,020
take advantage of your solitude because
that's very important when you get a

1053
01:07:08,021 --> 01:07:09,610
chance to be alone,
man,

1054
01:07:09,611 --> 01:07:14,600
that's very important time because that's
when you connect with the, the, the,

1055
01:07:14,601 --> 01:07:17,440
the spiritual. You're
spiritual teacher. How must've,

1056
01:07:17,441 --> 01:07:19,300
it must've felt so good
to be released though

1057
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:25,810
in a way. There was a lot of
sadness really. Yeah. Yeah.

1058
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:30,280
I never looked as good as
when I got released, man. Uh,

1059
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:34,150
one of the it because one of the
inmates there who was a barber,

1060
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:38,380
he spent two hours cutting my hair.
Perfect.

1061
01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:43,150
Is a Chicano know it just perfect.
I come out, my wife shall,

1062
01:07:43,170 --> 01:07:46,300
we looked at me. Whoa, that's
the best haircut you've ever had.

1063
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:51,640
Everything was, it was perfect.
We exercise it in jail. Oh,

1064
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,880
that's all you do.
You walk at night,

1065
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:59,410
there's a track and you can walk miles
around the track in the whole prisons out

1066
01:07:59,411 --> 01:08:01,270
there walking around,
walking around.

1067
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:04,960
That's when you socialize and talk
and everything else to people in the,

1068
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:08,170
and they all grouped
together and I learned games.

1069
01:08:08,171 --> 01:08:11,230
I learned how to play Bocce ball learn.

1070
01:08:11,350 --> 01:08:13,570
I played pool and I sang.

1071
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:18,440
I had a little area where I
had my own private studio.

1072
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:22,910
It was an entrance to the pool hall
and I'd sit in there and the echo was

1073
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:27,700
perfect. You guys had a pool hall? Oh
yeah. We had tennis courts, pool halls.

1074
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,480
Great time.
It was

1075
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:34,070
telling you other than
not being able to leave,

1076
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:38,090
and even then if you when to
leave, I'm going, why would
you want to leave? I mean,

1077
01:08:38,091 --> 01:08:40,880
it was perfect, so he didn't,
that's why people go back to jail.

1078
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:45,950
Totally get released. Only, I saw
one guy who was sad, he was crying,

1079
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:48,840
but he should be in there crying.
I said, what's wrong? He's,

1080
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:53,720
he gets released next month and he was
a junkie and he knew that as soon as he

1081
01:08:53,721 --> 01:08:58,010
hit the street, he was going
to die. He was going to die,
you know. And he did. He,

1082
01:08:58,011 --> 01:09:01,730
as soon as he hit the street, he
died. But he was funny. He was,

1083
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:07,130
they had a little game that when
they opened the dormitory, uh,

1084
01:09:07,730 --> 01:09:12,730
the first few people to hit the mess hall
got to order eggs any way they wanted,

1085
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:18,080
like over easy or sunny side up, whatever.
And so he'd be, he'd get all anxious.

1086
01:09:18,081 --> 01:09:21,740
He'd be the first guy in line and
you'd be kind of getting ready,

1087
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:25,340
getting ready to sue the doors opened.
Man. He'd do, and you couldn't run.

1088
01:09:25,341 --> 01:09:29,360
You had a walk. And so you learn that
fast. It had walked real fast and,

1089
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:34,070
and you, he was, he was a
delight. But when he got released,

1090
01:09:34,071 --> 01:09:38,570
he took his own life.
So yeah,

1091
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:43,070
I hung was on life with heroin or
probably, yeah, that's probably, it was,

1092
01:09:43,071 --> 01:09:47,540
it was sad. He just couldn't help
himself. Wants, no. Well, see, you know,

1093
01:09:47,541 --> 01:09:50,300
everybody's worried about socialism.
Well,

1094
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:53,680
America's biggest socialist
country in the world. Yeah.

1095
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:57,110
We've got more people in jail than
anywhere else in the world. And what's,

1096
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:01,550
what did what, what happens in
jail? Cradle to grave. You're fed,

1097
01:10:01,551 --> 01:10:04,900
you're close. You're told what
to wear. You're told what the uh,

1098
01:10:05,170 --> 01:10:09,290
W two,
you're allowed to study certain things.

1099
01:10:09,890 --> 01:10:13,580
You're totally controlled medical.
You got free medical there.

1100
01:10:13,581 --> 01:10:15,500
There were prisoners
that would go to jail,

1101
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:19,940
so they get their open heart surgery
because the federal law mandates that if

1102
01:10:19,941 --> 01:10:21,980
you have something wrong with you,
they have to fix it.

1103
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:25,880
And so there were prisoners that would
break the law so they could get in to get

1104
01:10:25,881 --> 01:10:30,860
their open heart surgery.
Wow. Yeah. That's crazy, man.

1105
01:10:30,950 --> 01:10:33,290
That's some next level thinking.
Yeah.

1106
01:10:33,291 --> 01:10:37,400
I want to go to jail so I can get open
heart surgery. Yeah. Yeah. What did,

1107
01:10:37,401 --> 01:10:39,680
what did they prevent you
from reading any books?

1108
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:43,720
Was there anything that was like on,
could you order whatever you wanted? They,

1109
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:49,680
they had a endless weird,
they had a thing about, uh,

1110
01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:54,350
they would take covers off magazines and,
and you know,

1111
01:10:54,351 --> 01:10:57,860
the wine subscription cards,

1112
01:10:58,070 --> 01:11:03,070
they would take that out because people
on the outside with dosen with the acid

1113
01:11:03,710 --> 01:11:07,760
LSD and shipped the books in there.
And then next thing you know,

1114
01:11:07,761 --> 01:11:11,690
half a dorm would be tripping on acid
cause they're eating pieces of the

1115
01:11:11,691 --> 01:11:16,560
subscription paper paper. Yeah. And
that, that kind of stuff always went on.

1116
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:21,510
But as far as, uh, now you can read
whatever you want it basically, you know,

1117
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:24,690
I read a lot of books at it,
you know,

1118
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:29,780
I was meaning to read, you know,
and I helped a lot of people. Uh,

1119
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:34,050
I would do the teaching, you know,
the change. I would do the itching,

1120
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:37,950
you know how to do that on
the Indian grounds. Oh yeah.
Yeah. It's a really easy,

1121
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:41,810
yeah. Throw the coins. It's
really heads tails. You know,

1122
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:47,070
it's supposedly, it's some sort of
a like future reading. Yeah. Thing.

1123
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:51,870
Do you think it works? Oh yeah. What
does the tire, well, first time I did it,

1124
01:11:52,830 --> 01:11:57,660
I roll it. I did my explain to people
how it works. Well, what it is,

1125
01:11:57,661 --> 01:12:00,930
you get three coins and and you,

1126
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:05,950
you throw the three clients in it and
you get numbers from six to nine and

1127
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:11,880
anything in between, six,
seven, six, eight, nine.

1128
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:15,240
I think this suddenly that, anyway, uh,

1129
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:20,270
each number tells you what line you're
going to read in Utero it three times and

1130
01:12:21,991 --> 01:12:26,820
you write down and then you get a
sort of like a, a plan of where,

1131
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:30,990
what page you're supposed to look at.
And then when you get the page,

1132
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:34,410
uh, then it tells you, you know, but,

1133
01:12:34,470 --> 01:12:38,870
but you're asking it because you've
got to ask the eating for what per,

1134
01:12:38,871 --> 01:12:41,460
if something, you know,
and it'll answer it,

1135
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:46,320
it'll answer you as for instance,
I threw mine when I did it.

1136
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:51,000
I threw it in the first line,
said you are in jail for a reason.

1137
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:55,740
Whoa. How does it say that? It just
said it when it says it. How was it?

1138
01:12:55,770 --> 01:12:57,660
What do you translate it?
You read it.

1139
01:12:58,260 --> 01:13:03,090
It's been written in that book for
centuries. That line is in the,

1140
01:13:03,091 --> 01:13:07,440
in that book for centuries, really,
3000 years, something like that.

1141
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:12,800
And so I read it because still they
still talk about chariots and kings and

1142
01:13:12,871 --> 01:13:17,340
Queens. Everything. That was the first
sign that you are in jail for a reason.

1143
01:13:17,730 --> 01:13:22,350
Gels are corrective institutions
that will correct your,

1144
01:13:22,410 --> 01:13:26,880
uh, behavior. That's what
the itching is telling you.

1145
01:13:26,910 --> 01:13:30,180
That's what the aging, well, what they
did, the updated, the girls that wrote it,

1146
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:33,790
they updated it to the
modern time. You know, it's,

1147
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:36,790
I think it's Armstrong is the girls that,

1148
01:13:37,070 --> 01:13:40,110
there are a couple of girls who wrote it.
It's a big thick book,

1149
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:44,940
but his head and then went
on there and another guy,

1150
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:49,860
Mike, this, this uh, Chicano,
he saw me, he's always a game.

1151
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:52,560
So he's all set for the game. What
would you playing? I said, no,

1152
01:13:52,561 --> 01:13:56,250
I'm doing the teaching. I said, do you
want me to do you? And he said, yeah.

1153
01:13:57,300 --> 01:14:02,300
So I did his and was very polite not to
read the readings of the other guy and

1154
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:05,610
let him read it first.

1155
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:11,150
And so I did the numbers and I give it
to him and he read it and he just handed

1156
01:14:12,521 --> 01:14:17,521
me the book and knew what sat
on his bunk and he just stared.

1157
01:14:18,490 --> 01:14:23,380
And so then I read what it said and he,

1158
01:14:23,420 --> 01:14:28,380
he, uh, a month before
he lost his wife in,

1159
01:14:28,430 --> 01:14:31,480
in child, in a car accident, they
were coming out to visit them

1160
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:37,150
and the [inaudible] said,
you suffered a great misfortune.

1161
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:40,820
Oh,

1162
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:45,070
it was like dead on.

1163
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:50,070
And the itching goes on to tell Ya,
you know what to do and,

1164
01:14:50,370 --> 01:14:53,650
and you know, this is, next
month is going to be tough,

1165
01:14:53,710 --> 01:14:55,600
this month is going to be good.
You know,

1166
01:14:56,030 --> 01:15:00,070
and we see hope for you is like astrology.
It's almost the same.

1167
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:02,530
Well,
I know Terence Mckenna was really into it.

1168
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:05,650
He's really into the each thing and he
thought it was some sort of a map of time.

1169
01:15:05,651 --> 01:15:10,651
He was trying to figure out what it was
and how it worked and why can predict

1170
01:15:10,811 --> 01:15:11,520
things.

1171
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:15,720
And if you mess with it, it'll, it'll
tell you investing fuck with it.

1172
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:20,370
I like we, we board, you know, sometimes
if you do the Ouija board, same thing.

1173
01:15:20,470 --> 01:15:23,820
If you start making it a game,
you know, let's ask it this.

1174
01:15:23,821 --> 01:15:26,610
Let's ask dad who's going to
win the race tomorrow on that.

1175
01:15:26,890 --> 01:15:31,890
And right away the chain catches
that and knows your real feelings and

1176
01:15:31,981 --> 01:15:35,490
intelligent, you know, tell you don't,
don't do that. What do you think it is?

1177
01:15:37,410 --> 01:15:41,610
It's a Chinese some methods of divination.

1178
01:15:41,611 --> 01:15:42,630
I think what it is,

1179
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:47,660
it's a spiritual way of communicating
this remembering ghost where,

1180
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:53,790
uh, Patrick Swayze had to
learn how to move a coin.

1181
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:57,480
Remember that the spirits,

1182
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:02,040
especially spiritual people,
they're around us.

1183
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:07,760
And so you give them a chance
to communicate with you
because they know all they

1184
01:16:08,881 --> 01:16:09,870
will communicate.

1185
01:16:10,410 --> 01:16:13,650
And so the itching gives it the
spirits a chance to communicate.

1186
01:16:13,651 --> 01:16:17,180
So when you throw a coin,
they know what, what,

1187
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:19,830
what heads or tails or whatever it is,

1188
01:16:19,850 --> 01:16:24,090
the number that you need to
read to talk to you. Right.

1189
01:16:24,390 --> 01:16:29,160
And that's, that's my theory,
Huh? You gotta try it, man.

1190
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:29,981
Yeah.
I'm,

1191
01:16:29,981 --> 01:16:34,490
I'm curious because I do know that many
people have used it to try to figure out

1192
01:16:34,850 --> 01:16:37,300
what their life is about and what
they're doing with their lives.

1193
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:39,560
And the weirdest thing about it is they,
they,

1194
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:44,450
they seem to find some real answers in
it and they keep them to themselves.

1195
01:16:44,510 --> 01:16:45,420
Yeah.
But the,

1196
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:50,660
the idea that I had heard that made the
most sense was that the way the world

1197
01:16:51,951 --> 01:16:56,951
works is not as simple and as easy
as one plus one equals two left,

1198
01:16:56,991 --> 01:16:58,610
right, left, right. Walked down the road.

1199
01:16:58,850 --> 01:17:03,020
But that there's intention and thought
that also helps formulate our universe.

1200
01:17:03,021 --> 01:17:03,400
And what the,

1201
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:08,400
each thing does is it somehow clarifies
intention and thought and clarifies

1202
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:12,710
like the actual,
your actual,

1203
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:17,450
the actual processes going
on in your mind and it,

1204
01:17:17,470 --> 01:17:20,780
it quantifies it and puts it into a like,
oh,

1205
01:17:20,781 --> 01:17:25,490
a way that you can read your effect on
life and life's effect on you in this.

1206
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:28,550
And then it reads it somehow or another
even though it doesn't make any sense

1207
01:17:28,790 --> 01:17:30,800
that, well, it's a method of divination.

1208
01:17:30,810 --> 01:17:33,680
It's method of discovering
what's happening. Yeah.

1209
01:17:33,681 --> 01:17:36,380
It's a method of communicating
with the spirit world.

1210
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:39,650
You think that's what it is.
Oh, Ghana. And the thing is,

1211
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:43,600
you're getting back to the AI,
the artificial intelligence, uh,

1212
01:17:44,450 --> 01:17:48,800
that we already used artificial
intelligence in our lives every day.

1213
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:52,790
Like Alexa is a good
example. That bitch. Yeah,

1214
01:17:53,620 --> 01:17:57,020
I love her.
She never

1215
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:02,990
steered me wrong yet. You know, she's
told me, I bet the wrong questions,

1216
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:06,980
but I see this and my theory is that,

1217
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:11,740
that we are,
we,

1218
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:17,200
everybody in the universe wants us
dispirits they want us to be enlightened,

1219
01:18:18,690 --> 01:18:20,930
you know,
because the more enlightened we are,

1220
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:25,970
the more we can enjoy what we,
what we're, what we've inherited.

1221
01:18:26,150 --> 01:18:30,980
Because when you're born into this
world, [inaudible] you, you've inherited,

1222
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:34,820
you're taking them for granted
kingdom amazing. You've inherited a,

1223
01:18:34,850 --> 01:18:39,020
especially in comparison to the
rest of time, all of human history.

1224
01:18:39,021 --> 01:18:43,120
This is the greatest time, the greatest
bolster to fortunate. So what I'm saying,

1225
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:46,890
look at us. Look, look, look what
we got now going for us to know.

1226
01:18:47,210 --> 01:18:52,070
And how much effort did that take? You
know, it was like being part of a team.

1227
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:56,390
And so when you're ready at Boomi, you're
pushed out in front, you're up there.

1228
01:18:56,600 --> 01:19:00,920
And so, you know, our, our duty as, as,

1229
01:19:01,130 --> 01:19:06,130
as students is to learn everything we
can learn and to teach whatever we can

1230
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:07,760
teach,
you know?

1231
01:19:08,030 --> 01:19:12,710
And that's why there should be no paranoia
because we're not here long enough.

1232
01:19:13,610 --> 01:19:18,350
So that being rich or being poor,
it makes any kind of a difference,

1233
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:21,980
you know,
because you know yourself,

1234
01:19:21,981 --> 01:19:26,810
I mean w w what do you really need in
this life? Right. What do you really need?

1235
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:31,690
Water, food, companionship.
Love. Yeah. France.

1236
01:19:31,790 --> 01:19:35,630
Yeah. Yeah. And something interesting
that you'd like to do. Yeah. Cause I, I,

1237
01:19:35,631 --> 01:19:39,800
I've been hanging with billionaires now.
And what have you been doing with them?

1238
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:44,140
You understand your note? You know,
they, they, they like me because I,

1239
01:19:44,830 --> 01:19:49,220
I get recognized everywhere I
go. And so, so it sort of, uh,

1240
01:19:49,670 --> 01:19:53,780
it's like, uh, you know, walking
around status symbol, famous guy a,

1241
01:19:53,781 --> 01:19:58,781
you can get into restaurants and
pitchers and for the most part they're,

1242
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:07,840
they're hardworking, very, you know, like

1243
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,820
a lot of burdens being rich,

1244
01:20:12,620 --> 01:20:17,290
a lot of burdens and, and the, you know,

1245
01:20:17,291 --> 01:20:21,750
it just with me, you know, it's
like, instead of owning a boat,

1246
01:20:21,751 --> 01:20:25,140
I'd rather know a guy that owns the bolts
definitely enough to deal with any of

1247
01:20:25,141 --> 01:20:29,250
the maintenance. That's
true. I like to be free.

1248
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:33,560
I like to be totally free. Yeah. Yeah.

1249
01:20:33,570 --> 01:20:37,740
That's the reality of, I mean, if you
want to have a big, giant crazy business,

1250
01:20:37,741 --> 01:20:39,120
you're going to have a lot of employees.

1251
01:20:39,121 --> 01:20:42,240
You're gonna have a lot of problems you
have to deal with and you're the last

1252
01:20:42,241 --> 01:20:46,110
guy to get paid. Yep. Yeah. And
you're the last guy that goes home.

1253
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:50,670
Everybody else forgets what they're doing
as soon as they walk out the door and

1254
01:20:50,671 --> 01:20:54,510
you're, all those problems are in
your, but yeah. Yeah, that's true.

1255
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:57,540
I went through that.
I had to nightclubs at one time,

1256
01:20:57,541 --> 01:21:00,720
but I never bothered with
the money part at all.

1257
01:21:00,721 --> 01:21:03,570
I just worried about the stage.

1258
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:08,010
The Mike was working in
the US in Vancouver when,

1259
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:11,970
how long ago was this? This was sixties
in the sense that you had nightclubs,

1260
01:21:11,971 --> 01:21:16,260
like comedy clubs or like one,
one was an after hours,

1261
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:21,470
sorta like a jazz dance bottle
club and it was given to me.

1262
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:26,400
It's here, there again, you know, hey, Hey
Tommy, me, you went to club and I said,

1263
01:21:26,401 --> 01:21:28,930
sure. The Guy bought
give you a club. Yeah,

1264
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:33,270
well he bought a building and back in.
Then back in the day,

1265
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:36,600
there was a steak house in
the basement. He says, man,

1266
01:21:36,690 --> 01:21:40,800
the chairs pay rent when
you can. What? So I went in,

1267
01:21:40,801 --> 01:21:43,870
what was this guy's deal?
He owned buildings healing.

1268
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:48,330
Most people that own buildings don't be
giving them away. Oh yeah. All they do,

1269
01:21:48,690 --> 01:21:51,210
they rent free rent.
You saw him all the time.

1270
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:55,020
You can get a years free rent just because
they want to get someone in the only

1271
01:21:55,030 --> 01:21:57,200
blend that you get it.
You get it going.

1272
01:21:57,201 --> 01:21:59,750
And seeing as soon as we
start being successful,

1273
01:21:59,770 --> 01:22:04,290
we were paying $500 a month
rent. So he got, you're going.

1274
01:22:04,350 --> 01:22:09,350
So we made a ton of money in there
and that's where I got the bands.

1275
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:10,530
You know,

1276
01:22:10,530 --> 01:22:15,530
that's where I honed my skills as
a musician and singer and all that.

1277
01:22:15,601 --> 01:22:20,601
And then I got offered
another club because it was
going under and it was a dine

1278
01:22:21,471 --> 01:22:25,370
and dance club in Chinatown.
And I thought, yeah,

1279
01:22:25,420 --> 01:22:28,780
make a great strip club. And so, so we,

1280
01:22:28,781 --> 01:22:32,100
we took it over to the Shanghai junk,
turned it into a strip club,

1281
01:22:32,130 --> 01:22:33,570
Vancouver's first strip club.

1282
01:22:34,530 --> 01:22:38,870
And then you were the
proprietor of Vancouver's first
ever first trip come from

1283
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:43,540
this one. And in fact we
did a, uh, in fact we did a,

1284
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:49,800
uh, a midnight mass at a church. Uh,

1285
01:22:49,830 --> 01:22:54,570
I think we had the stripper dancing
at the church, but not stripping.

1286
01:22:54,810 --> 01:22:58,620
She kept your clothes on. She danced.
That's appropriate. Yeah. Yeah.

1287
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:02,790
You got to you, there's a line. When did
you start getting into the live shows?

1288
01:23:03,390 --> 01:23:07,690
Well when, uh, I got
fired from Motown, uh,

1289
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:11,650
because I had to get a green card and
nobody had Motown knew with a green card

1290
01:23:11,651 --> 01:23:15,130
was, and so I had to miss a Gig, uh, to,

1291
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:16,960
to get my green card.

1292
01:23:16,990 --> 01:23:20,410
I got the green card and they
came back and I got fired.

1293
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:24,980
And so then Barry Gordy found out about
it. He said, Oh, you're not fired. I said,

1294
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:29,020
I think I'll stay fired. I want to be
at Berry Gordy. I don't work for one.

1295
01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:30,940
And so then came out to,
uh,

1296
01:23:30,970 --> 01:23:35,950
out to La and tried to live on
the beach and be a songwriter.

1297
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:38,920
But then my clubs were calling
me because they needed help.

1298
01:23:39,370 --> 01:23:43,990
So I went back and I turned the strip
club into an improvisational club.

1299
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:48,970
So we're doing naked.
Improv was great man.

1300
01:23:49,630 --> 01:23:52,570
All the girls and then they were actors.
There are strippers.

1301
01:23:53,050 --> 01:23:54,760
Once I turned them into actresses,

1302
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:59,120
there were a lot cheaper and there are
not more beautiful. The, the target,

1303
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:04,560
they did skits and then they would take
off their clothes when they had to, uh,

1304
01:24:04,860 --> 01:24:09,190
be it within, within, you know, the, the
script. And that's where I met Cheech,

1305
01:24:10,150 --> 01:24:12,310
cause we had a street guy in the street,
guys,

1306
01:24:12,311 --> 01:24:16,620
wife found out what he was doing and
you can hold them away. And then she,

1307
01:24:16,621 --> 01:24:21,100
she came onboard as a straight guy.
And then when, when everything,

1308
01:24:21,110 --> 01:24:24,850
Vancouver, Vancouver, yeah. But
teaches an La guy, right? Yeah.

1309
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:28,480
He was up there in case of
Viet Cong attacked from Alaska.

1310
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:36,190
So he was hiding even from the draft.
Well, not really. He will not really,

1311
01:24:36,191 --> 01:24:40,430
it was trying to stay out of the way.
Let's put it out. And then, then he,

1312
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:44,320
he had a sneak back in [inaudible]
from [inaudible]. Yeah.

1313
01:24:44,530 --> 01:24:47,380
But it was easy coming
into La from Canada.

1314
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:52,180
He just showed someone else's Id and they
said dog one and back in the day. Yeah.

1315
01:24:52,230 --> 01:24:56,980
We're all slots. Slipperier yeah. And
that's, so that's why I'm saying I,

1316
01:24:56,981 --> 01:25:01,090
I'm so blessed, you know, because
everything, the universe, you know,

1317
01:25:01,270 --> 01:25:04,180
and it was from the teaching start,
uh,

1318
01:25:04,270 --> 01:25:08,190
one of the guitar players turned me
onto the each thing back then. And,

1319
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:12,370
and my reading was perfection.
You're going to be,

1320
01:25:12,570 --> 01:25:15,490
everything's perfect.
You're going to really do well.

1321
01:25:16,270 --> 01:25:21,270
And then Cheech and Chong and
all that stuff happened and,

1322
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:25,640
and you guys are touring again? Yeah. All
right. How long have you been born again?

1323
01:25:26,070 --> 01:25:30,880
When did you guys get back together? Boy,
eight Oh eight yeah. Hold 11 years. Yeah.

1324
01:25:31,220 --> 01:25:34,700
How crazy is that? That that's 11 years
ago. That doesn't seem like 11 years ago.

1325
01:25:34,810 --> 01:25:38,680
I know you say, oh wait. It's like, oh,
just happened. And you're like, oh no,

1326
01:25:38,690 --> 01:25:41,690
it's 2019 so almost 2020 no,

1327
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:46,530
I know that the train keeps the
ruling, dude. It never stops.

1328
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:47,690
What does this Jamie,

1329
01:25:48,650 --> 01:25:53,120
Bobby Taylor and the Vancouvers well,
that's me.

1330
01:25:53,210 --> 01:25:55,970
That's you? Yeah. How old were you there?

1331
01:25:56,540 --> 01:26:01,510
23 Bobby Taylor and the Vancouvers twice.

1332
01:26:01,511 --> 01:26:03,980
I kind of sunglasses off.
Yeah,

1333
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:08,390
they did. Even back then. Wow.
Bobby Taylor and the Vancouvers.

1334
01:26:08,391 --> 01:26:10,190
That's the motel on sunset strip.

1335
01:26:11,390 --> 01:26:15,350
Is that you with the yellow jacket?
Which ones? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1336
01:26:15,410 --> 01:26:16,880
That's you. Yeah, that's me.

1337
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,650
Wow,

1338
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:23,710
that's crazy. And then we,
we went over to England,

1339
01:26:24,850 --> 01:26:28,090
met Jimi Hendrix, whoa.
And changed our lives.

1340
01:26:28,930 --> 01:26:33,790
This is where we look when we went over
there and where you can bag long hair.

1341
01:26:34,180 --> 01:26:37,040
Everybody wear different clothes.
Wow.

1342
01:26:37,870 --> 01:26:41,920
Now when you went from this to comedy?
Yeah.

1343
01:26:41,950 --> 01:26:45,040
Like how did you make that leap?
Well,

1344
01:26:45,820 --> 01:26:50,320
nobody really knew that
I could talk. You know,

1345
01:26:50,321 --> 01:26:54,490
I was in a black band, so everybody else,
you know, how was the guitar player?

1346
01:26:54,491 --> 01:26:58,930
So you know, I had nothing to say
other than Allen, the club, you know,

1347
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:03,790
and no one knew that. No one knew that
I was always a backup guitar player.

1348
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:09,700
When I got into comedy wells was
doing what happened. I at hired,

1349
01:27:09,701 --> 01:27:13,570
when I turned the strip club into
a Improv, a clo improvisation club,

1350
01:27:14,110 --> 01:27:16,900
I hired the act we already had,

1351
01:27:16,930 --> 01:27:21,400
which was a black tap dancer
named taps Harris and Jenia,

1352
01:27:21,401 --> 01:27:25,270
a black singer. And they
had a band. And so I,

1353
01:27:25,271 --> 01:27:27,720
the first skit I had tapped it,

1354
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:32,290
the first kid was about a Pajama party
that all the strippers were having at

1355
01:27:32,291 --> 01:27:33,310
their house after.

1356
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:38,580
And so they all change into their pajamas
and in their little ladies and that

1357
01:27:38,771 --> 01:27:43,240
was very sexy. And then taps
came, comes by after the show,

1358
01:27:43,570 --> 01:27:46,270
you know, so-called, and,
and they say, hey tabs,

1359
01:27:46,271 --> 01:27:49,300
do that number that you did a on the show.
And so taps,

1360
01:27:49,450 --> 01:27:51,460
first time you ever tap danced,
you know,

1361
01:27:51,490 --> 01:27:55,150
in front of a live audience
because usually he was just an MC.

1362
01:27:55,390 --> 01:28:00,020
So he did his tap dance and then it was
so good that everybody wanted her dawn

1363
01:28:00,030 --> 01:28:03,550
card. So they made them do an
encore. He quit that night.

1364
01:28:04,650 --> 01:28:08,310
Really? Yeah. It was too
hard work, man. That's,

1365
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:11,080
he was hired to just do the Lolo.

1366
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:16,450
And so the doorman who lit
English guy named Dave.

1367
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:21,640
And so I said, Dave, I need
a, an Mc, you know, he said,
well, I'll do it if you do it.

1368
01:28:23,140 --> 01:28:26,170
And so I, I, okay. And so we became,

1369
01:28:26,171 --> 01:28:29,070
Dave was my first partner
and so we started,

1370
01:28:29,110 --> 01:28:32,470
we had long hair where they
hippies. And so we, we, we were,

1371
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:35,920
we did a lot of hippies and Qa jokes,
you know,

1372
01:28:35,921 --> 01:28:39,220
tits and ass jokes and uh,
and then,

1373
01:28:39,530 --> 01:28:44,440
then we had a guitar player named gate
alarm. He, he wrote the, the, our big hit,

1374
01:28:44,441 --> 01:28:47,950
you know, that your eight,
my eye, he wrote the music.

1375
01:28:48,250 --> 01:28:51,970
And so gay was this incredible
guitarist and he could do all,

1376
01:28:52,150 --> 01:28:57,010
but he was very funny, funny, funny
guy. And so we wrote a skit, you know,

1377
01:28:57,011 --> 01:28:59,680
where,
where you were tortured the audience,

1378
01:28:59,710 --> 01:29:03,690
they're all biker mostly don't come to
a strip bar. You didn't bikers in that.

1379
01:29:03,990 --> 01:29:08,990
And so the first act we had it because
when we turned it into a theater company,

1380
01:29:09,390 --> 01:29:13,110
we attracted all the theater. People
all know performers, you know,

1381
01:29:13,111 --> 01:29:17,760
there was a stage, oh boy, we'll go
work there. And so we had a mime artist.

1382
01:29:18,510 --> 01:29:19,710
And so we opened the show with them.

1383
01:29:19,711 --> 01:29:22,260
I am artist and Gaye
playing classical guitar.

1384
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:25,080
He's playing this classical
guitar now this is a strip joint.

1385
01:29:25,590 --> 01:29:28,620
And all they're hardened bikers are
sitting around waiting for naked girls to

1386
01:29:28,621 --> 01:29:32,430
come out. And here comes, here
comes a mime artist, you know,

1387
01:29:32,670 --> 01:29:36,910
so pretend he's, he's picking flowers
and smelling the mood, the tone,

1388
01:29:37,010 --> 01:29:41,350
the prancing around the stage and

1389
01:29:42,990 --> 01:29:47,040
the, so the bikers sat through that, you
know, the neighbor yelling things like,

1390
01:29:47,041 --> 01:29:51,090
hey Elvis,
their remarks were that funny.

1391
01:29:51,450 --> 01:29:56,370
And then send the, Dave would come
out and Dave's very funny looking guy.

1392
01:29:56,400 --> 01:30:00,360
He looks like a, it looks like an
Improv actor and they come out and he,

1393
01:30:00,361 --> 01:30:02,250
and he sings this horrible side.

1394
01:30:02,251 --> 01:30:05,730
I dream of Jeannie with
the light brown hair.

1395
01:30:05,731 --> 01:30:09,240
Jeannie is my favorite wire hair terrier.

1396
01:30:09,870 --> 01:30:13,710
And then just when the bikers
are getting ready to revolt,

1397
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:18,230
I opened, I kicked the door open,
we had doors on the back, you know,

1398
01:30:18,530 --> 01:30:21,450
and I kicked the door open and shirtless.

1399
01:30:21,790 --> 01:30:26,100
My hair's messed up and I got a rolled
up newspaper and I walk over to David

1400
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:28,290
Goal.
What kind of fucking song is that?

1401
01:30:28,350 --> 01:30:33,240
I beat him to death with this
newspaper and the bikers to explode.

1402
01:30:33,241 --> 01:30:37,140
The whole joint just exploded, you
know, laughter. Because we had,

1403
01:30:37,370 --> 01:30:41,520
we created that tension
that long and then release.

1404
01:30:41,550 --> 01:30:46,440
The release was like as a roar and
then the word went out, boom. And that,

1405
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:49,560
that place was packed almost every night.
Wow.

1406
01:30:49,590 --> 01:30:53,190
What a weird world that must've been back
then. They'll give us the city works.

1407
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:54,130
There we are.

1408
01:30:54,130 --> 01:30:58,410
There's days that Turkle sexy
at the Shang. Hi. There's

1409
01:30:58,820 --> 01:31:00,610
the far are right.

1410
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:05,960
Wow. That's Cheech. That's
crazy. That's cheat.

1411
01:31:05,980 --> 01:31:09,730
That's Dave. That's me. Wow. Without

1412
01:31:09,730 --> 01:31:13,360
a goatee. And that's the, my
Martha says Ian, the mime artist,

1413
01:31:13,890 --> 01:31:18,040
and it's windy, Maureen and surely. Wow.

1414
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:22,900
What a weird world. Is it
crazy looking at that? Oh yeah.

1415
01:31:23,370 --> 01:31:26,280
Wow. Memories. Huh? Wow.

1416
01:31:28,510 --> 01:31:32,420
That was the first a strip joint
starting Tuesday. Yeah. Yeah.

1417
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:37,450
While the police were there. And when
did you start doing albums with Cheech?

1418
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:42,370
Cheech 71 how'd that all take place?
Well,

1419
01:31:42,371 --> 01:31:47,371
we came down there and 70 and we struggled
with all the places that we could,

1420
01:31:49,030 --> 01:31:53,800
we could work. Then we started
being a regular at the troubadour.

1421
01:31:54,790 --> 01:31:58,090
They had hootenanny night, Sunday night.
What does that mean? What's hootenanny?

1422
01:31:58,091 --> 01:32:00,070
Those learning is when the folk singers,

1423
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:04,390
we'd get on stage and singers sing a
song hootenanny hootenanny the hootenanny

1424
01:32:04,391 --> 01:32:07,630
night. And so all the
singers would sing, you know?

1425
01:32:07,780 --> 01:32:12,780
And so we would get up and do comedy
and of course we became regulars,

1426
01:32:13,781 --> 01:32:18,130
you know, in fact the tubular would phone
us up and say, are you guys come in?

1427
01:32:18,730 --> 01:32:21,640
Because they had a lot of requests.
And how did it transpire?

1428
01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:26,440
This weed based comedy? Well it was the
only thing that worked in this audience.

1429
01:32:27,130 --> 01:32:31,030
The we'd see when we're, the
city works with TNA, you know.

1430
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:33,250
But when we got down here,

1431
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:37,660
we had a go right for the stoners because
that was what was going on, you know?

1432
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:43,200
And so we played a a club
in Receda Irma hotel.

1433
01:32:43,750 --> 01:32:48,070
It was sort of this call
and it was owned by a crazy,

1434
01:32:48,110 --> 01:32:51,760
it was a big fan. He saw
us work somewhere. And so
he hired us for two nights.

1435
01:32:52,540 --> 01:32:54,700
And in the first night,

1436
01:32:55,540 --> 01:32:59,320
personally we had to do two shows,
but it was a dance club.

1437
01:32:59,770 --> 01:33:04,450
And so the dancers had to stop dancing,
sit down and watch us to a show and,

1438
01:33:04,550 --> 01:33:06,340
and it was not a good combination.

1439
01:33:06,341 --> 01:33:11,341
So the first show didn't go very well
because we're doing TNA stuff and just

1440
01:33:11,441 --> 01:33:12,274
didn't go over.

1441
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:17,260
And so the second show teach and I
got together and I teach, c'mon man,

1442
01:33:17,261 --> 01:33:20,110
you're from here.
There must be a character you can do.

1443
01:33:21,190 --> 01:33:25,380
And the night before that we
were standing outside and uh,

1444
01:33:25,660 --> 01:33:27,850
this low rider pulls up and you go,
hey man,

1445
01:33:28,450 --> 01:33:32,950
tell me how to get the receipt boulevard.
And she says, Oh, you're on it. He goes,

1446
01:33:32,980 --> 01:33:37,840
oh, thanks man. And he's
overweight and was that character?

1447
01:33:38,230 --> 01:33:41,740
And Cheech says, yeah, well
yeah, we can do that character.

1448
01:33:41,741 --> 01:33:45,190
And then I showed them that
the carbon that's an old black,

1449
01:33:45,210 --> 01:33:48,550
a comedian chilled me,
Sir Pineapple,

1450
01:33:48,700 --> 01:33:53,350
you show me this whole taking a girl out
on a date and he just make the car up

1451
01:33:53,351 --> 01:33:56,200
here by pretending to wash it whacks,
you know,

1452
01:33:56,590 --> 01:33:59,290
just do the mine in the car would appear.

1453
01:33:59,291 --> 01:34:03,550
And then Cheech got in the car and
he's driving and then he goes, hey,

1454
01:34:03,551 --> 01:34:07,000
red frequent or ride man.
And then I would come out and we'd do our,

1455
01:34:07,150 --> 01:34:08,440
our skits and,

1456
01:34:08,860 --> 01:34:13,270
and went over it really well as soon as
we started doing, you know, weed and,

1457
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:17,560
and pills and stuff.
Everybody related.

1458
01:34:17,830 --> 01:34:22,030
So you feel like you had that and then
he just ran with it? Oh yeah. Yeah.

1459
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:24,040
And then we just improved,
improved, improved, improved.

1460
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:29,320
And so when we met Lou Adler Saws and
we never thought about doing a record

1461
01:34:29,321 --> 01:34:34,321
until we went to meet him in his office
and he's got gold records are all over

1462
01:34:34,901 --> 01:34:38,410
the place. And we said, yeah, we
can do, we'll do a record. You know,

1463
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:43,030
I was a big Lenny Bruce fan anyway,
because when I got high the first time I,

1464
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:45,910
the guy gave me a joint
and a Lenny Bruce Record.

1465
01:34:47,410 --> 01:34:50,860
So I studied that record for months.

1466
01:34:51,340 --> 01:34:55,090
And so that was ingrained in my head.
And so then when we started doing,

1467
01:34:55,720 --> 01:35:00,720
the first bit we did was an accident and
Cheech got locked outside the mixdown

1468
01:35:02,230 --> 01:35:04,360
room though we were on Labrea,

1469
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:08,840
you know the old Charlie Chapman studio
and it was the little courtyard that

1470
01:35:08,841 --> 01:35:13,841
where the sun was beating down was like
noon and it was hot and teaches a method

1471
01:35:14,931 --> 01:35:17,180
actor. And he had, he put on
all the costumes, you know,

1472
01:35:17,181 --> 01:35:20,460
they could get into character.
So he's got all these costumes,

1473
01:35:20,461 --> 01:35:25,220
Ziney knocks on the door and I was
working the tape recorder and I,

1474
01:35:25,221 --> 01:35:26,140
and when he knocked out,

1475
01:35:26,170 --> 01:35:29,600
I looked up at the door and I didn't
see if the needle moved or not.

1476
01:35:30,230 --> 01:35:33,500
And so when he not,
I didn't answer.

1477
01:35:33,501 --> 01:35:37,340
And then you knocked again and I saw the
needle moved and so I said, who is it?

1478
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:40,760
And I was supposed to just
open the door and let him in.

1479
01:35:41,390 --> 01:35:46,190
And so there was a pause. It's a
meme there, it's me, let me in.

1480
01:35:46,580 --> 01:35:51,500
Come on man. So then there's that where
Dave's not here came from it. So I waited,

1481
01:35:51,590 --> 01:35:56,280
then he knocked again in a
long pause. The pause. The,

1482
01:35:56,310 --> 01:36:00,430
who is it? And he's getting mad. Come
on man, it's me. I think the cop saw me.

1483
01:36:00,431 --> 01:36:05,090
You come on open up, you know they went
into character then. Then I'll just wait,

1484
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:08,120
wait, wait. It's way
for me to open the door.

1485
01:36:08,420 --> 01:36:12,590
Then he knocked again and w finally
goes, it's me, Dave, man, Dave.

1486
01:36:13,430 --> 01:36:17,180
I said, Dave. And he goes,
yeah, I go to Dave's not here.

1487
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:22,130
He blew it, kicking the doors, screaming,

1488
01:36:22,131 --> 01:36:26,690
opened the door and you almost punched
me. And, but I said, listen, listen,

1489
01:36:26,691 --> 01:36:31,280
listen week. We played it
back and then Lou heard it.

1490
01:36:31,340 --> 01:36:32,990
We recorded it.
Not as funny,

1491
01:36:32,991 --> 01:36:37,670
but we recorded it and next
day it was all over America.

1492
01:36:38,150 --> 01:36:40,760
Cheech and Chong was born.
Wow.

1493
01:36:40,820 --> 01:36:45,680
And then how long after that you
start doing movies? Seven years. 78

1494
01:36:47,270 --> 01:36:50,720
we started doing the movies because
I got tired of going to Australia.

1495
01:36:50,750 --> 01:36:54,290
Did you guys get accused of promoting pot?
Oh yeah.

1496
01:36:54,410 --> 01:36:56,130
Like did you get like accused like you,

1497
01:36:56,150 --> 01:36:59,960
you guys are a bad influence on the youth.
And what was that like?

1498
01:37:00,460 --> 01:37:04,580
There was nothing really, there's
more publicity basically, you know,

1499
01:37:05,420 --> 01:37:07,310
you know, it's just people, you know,

1500
01:37:07,311 --> 01:37:11,750
you know what really got
what really I noticed anyway.

1501
01:37:11,780 --> 01:37:14,810
It was the, uh, the comedy establishment,

1502
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:19,160
the committee in the second city,
all those guys,

1503
01:37:19,220 --> 01:37:22,400
they hated us, really hated us. Why?

1504
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:26,930
Except Bellucci Belushi was the only one
that loved us cause Belushi was young

1505
01:37:26,931 --> 01:37:30,440
enough that he heard our
records and it influenced him.

1506
01:37:31,190 --> 01:37:34,980
But these other guys like,
um, uh, what's his name?

1507
01:37:34,981 --> 01:37:38,930
I can't even think of his name now. Maybe
it's better. I don't even name them.

1508
01:37:39,110 --> 01:37:43,820
But they, they, Howard Hesseman, he,
he was one of the committee members,

1509
01:37:43,821 --> 01:37:47,980
you know, and, and you know,
Wk Erp and Cincinnati shore.

1510
01:37:48,410 --> 01:37:49,340
He was a big,

1511
01:37:49,450 --> 01:37:54,450
and I got influenced by him big time
because I saw him doing the committee in,

1512
01:37:56,270 --> 01:38:00,780
in San Francisco and they had a top
notch, a, an Improv group there.

1513
01:38:01,290 --> 01:38:02,730
And they were incredible.

1514
01:38:02,850 --> 01:38:06,780
And that's where I got the inspiration
to go up and turn the Strip club into a

1515
01:38:06,930 --> 01:38:11,070
improvisational club because
I love Improv. Why didn't
those guys like you? What,

1516
01:38:11,071 --> 01:38:12,960
what was the,
cause we were successful.

1517
01:38:13,770 --> 01:38:16,330
We took what they were doing
and took it out of the,

1518
01:38:16,620 --> 01:38:21,180
that snotty CEO to CEO to,
you know,

1519
01:38:21,181 --> 01:38:24,960
I'm so, I'm so evolved
theatrically, you know,

1520
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:29,700
that who does records, you know, that
kind of thing. And next thing you know,

1521
01:38:29,701 --> 01:38:33,930
teach skirts were bad back then. Well,
the ended up trying to do a record,

1522
01:38:34,110 --> 01:38:38,460
but they had, they had no clue. You
know, like, see I'm a fighter man.

1523
01:38:38,461 --> 01:38:41,070
I've been in the trenches forever.
You know,

1524
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:44,070
I've been playing black clubs
as long as I can remember.

1525
01:38:44,490 --> 01:38:49,050
And so I seen a lot of humor, a lot
of the standup comics, you know,

1526
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:54,120
red foxes, a real good friend of mine.
Did you ever do as comedy club his? Yeah.

1527
01:38:54,340 --> 01:38:58,500
Yeah. Ever hear those Richard Pryor
tapes from the Red Fox comedy club?

1528
01:38:59,010 --> 01:39:02,790
They would record him like doing his
work outs, outs, fucking amazing stuff.

1529
01:39:02,791 --> 01:39:07,040
Amazing. Oh yeah. Richard Richard
was a big fan. Big Fan. Now see,

1530
01:39:07,050 --> 01:39:09,750
we had fans like that,
but when she should,

1531
01:39:09,751 --> 01:39:13,620
I did the comedy store after up in smoke,

1532
01:39:14,170 --> 01:39:18,990
we broke up with Lou and we were broke.
We had a hit movie with no money.

1533
01:39:18,991 --> 01:39:22,740
Nothing. Kaylee, what happened? They
stole your money with Lou. Yeah.

1534
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:27,660
Who was Lou Lou Adler. Okay. And he's
the producer and director of up in smoke.

1535
01:39:28,470 --> 01:39:32,760
And although I wrote, wrote it
and directed it, most of it,

1536
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:37,860
and especially the ending, uh,
I, I directed, I like, again,

1537
01:39:37,890 --> 01:39:41,640
like again, like I said before, I'm
not into into the money part of it.

1538
01:39:41,700 --> 01:39:46,280
And how will you guys broke while we
weren't getting any money from our law

1539
01:39:46,350 --> 01:39:48,990
because we had to stop
touring because of the movie.

1540
01:39:49,580 --> 01:39:53,100
And so we had no touring money
coming in. Right. And so,

1541
01:39:53,190 --> 01:39:57,180
and then we got paid pump, you
know, a little bit on the movie,

1542
01:39:57,720 --> 01:40:01,470
but nothing compared to what we
were making on the road. And uh,

1543
01:40:01,650 --> 01:40:04,560
what does a hugely successful
movie. Right. Totally. Totally.

1544
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:08,920
But that's the way it is. I just to just,
they took all the money. Yeah. Yeah.

1545
01:40:09,650 --> 01:40:14,550
You did. I mean, we got, uh, we get dribs
and drabs at the end of the accounting,

1546
01:40:15,610 --> 01:40:19,320
the Hollywood accounting. Yeah. At
the end of the period of, you know,

1547
01:40:19,530 --> 01:40:22,590
when you forget when you're gone onto
something else and then you get a check.

1548
01:40:22,620 --> 01:40:24,480
Oh that's nice.
Yeah.

1549
01:40:24,570 --> 01:40:29,570
But so Cheech and I went to the comedy
store to get our act together and Richard

1550
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:33,630
Pryor helped us ought to stage.

1551
01:40:34,110 --> 01:40:36,810
We had about five sold out shows.

1552
01:40:36,850 --> 01:40:41,640
Pauly shore was a little guy up in the
light boots and watch knows cause he was

1553
01:40:41,641 --> 01:40:46,410
too young to be in the, in the
crowd. And as we walked up the stage,

1554
01:40:46,411 --> 01:40:48,560
the first night,
Richard's there,

1555
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:53,220
he held out his hand and was the
greatest compliment ever. Wow.

1556
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:58,300
That must have been incredible. It was.
Listen man, you had an amazing life.

1557
01:40:58,360 --> 01:41:02,960
You really have. The itching
was correct. Oh yeah, totally.

1558
01:41:03,150 --> 01:41:05,830
It's worked out incredible.
I got to find a professional.

1559
01:41:05,860 --> 01:41:08,180
You got to get them to come
in and read us the Chang.

1560
01:41:08,370 --> 01:41:12,070
Someone who really knows their
shit. Do it. It's easy. Read it.

1561
01:41:12,610 --> 01:41:17,530
There's one called uh, arms, the Armstrong
version. I'll text it to you. Okay.

1562
01:41:17,590 --> 01:41:21,760

choice. We're going to get it.

1565

Dispensaries everywhere. Is there
a website? Yeah, there's websites.

1566
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:39,020
There is actually the fun is finding
Chung's choice because we are so,

1567
01:41:39,540 --> 01:41:39,850
uh,

1568
01:41:39,850 --> 01:41:44,850
elite as far as the testing in the
purity of the product that it's very rare

1569
01:41:47,621 --> 01:41:52,621
that certain dispensary's habit
and a lot of dispensaries don't.

1570
01:41:53,390 --> 01:41:57,310
And they'll try to sell you something
else, but don't settle for less man.
