00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.550
For any trait, there are usually variations.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.010
&gt;&gt; So wait, are you talking about things

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.100
like eye color, like blue, green, brown, hazel.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.920
&gt;&gt; Right, exactly. Eye color is an example of a single trait,

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.350
but for that one trait you can have different versions or variants;

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:19.170
brown, green, blue. Variation is a huge theme in this course. And

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.040
it's important to recognize that different

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.260
people have different perspectives on different variations.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.350
&gt;&gt; It's true,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.480
I guess. I've always liked hazel eyes.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.600
&gt;&gt; And why have you always liked hazel eyes?

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.180
&gt;&gt; I don't know. I just think they're better.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.960
&gt;&gt; And I guess that's sort of

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.480
what we're talking about. The word better sometimes

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.220
implies that there's a good or bad eye color to begin with. We don't really want

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.590
to do that. For the most part, good

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.520
and bad shouldn't be used to reference personal

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.780
preference. Instead, for our course, we'll reserve the

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.360
word bad only for variations of traits that

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.930
cause serious health conditions, or even fatality.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.190
&gt;&gt; Fair enough. So I want to know what

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.590
you think. What traits are better or worse than

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.030
other traits? These can be physical, personality or behavioral

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.470
traits. List one in each one of these boxes.
