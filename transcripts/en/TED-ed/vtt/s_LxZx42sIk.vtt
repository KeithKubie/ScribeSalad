00:00:07.108 --> 00:00:12.957
This pencil-eraser-sized mass of cells 
is something called a brain organoid.

00:00:12.957 --> 00:00:16.989
It’s a collection of lab-grown neurons 
and other brain tissue

00:00:16.989 --> 00:00:21.350
that scientists can use to
learn about full-grown human brains.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.230
And it can be grown from 
a sample of your skin cells.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.319
Why would we need such a thing?

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:30.470
Neuroscientists face a challenge:

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.739
shielded by our thick skulls and
swaddled in layers of protective tissue,

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.829
the human brain is
extremely difficult to observe in action.

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.221
For centuries, scientists have tried to
understand them using autopsies,

00:00:44.221 --> 00:00:45.230
animal models,

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.367
and, in recent years, imaging techniques.

00:00:48.367 --> 00:00:50.631
We’ve learned a lot through 
all these methods,

00:00:50.631 --> 00:00:52.421
but they have limitations.

00:00:52.421 --> 00:00:54.692
Conditions like Alzheimer’s 
and schizophrenia,

00:00:54.692 --> 00:00:58.541
and the effect on
the human brain of diseases like Zika,

00:00:58.541 --> 00:01:03.281
continue to hide beyond our view,
and our understanding.

00:01:03.281 --> 00:01:07.061
Enter brain organoids, 
which function like human brains

00:01:07.061 --> 00:01:09.286
but aren’t part of an organism.

00:01:09.286 --> 00:01:12.712
Each one comes from 
an undifferentiated stem cell,

00:01:12.712 --> 00:01:16.601
which is a cell that
can develop into any tissue in the body,

00:01:16.601 --> 00:01:18.437
from bone to brain.

00:01:18.437 --> 00:01:23.576
Scientists can make undifferentiated 
stem cells from skin cells.

00:01:23.576 --> 00:01:27.607
That means they can take a skin sample 
from a person with a particular condition

00:01:27.607 --> 00:01:31.415
and generate brain organoids
from that person.

00:01:31.415 --> 00:01:34.250
The hardest part of growing 
a brain organoid,

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.244
which stumped scientists for years,

00:01:36.244 --> 00:01:41.443
was finding the perfect combination of
sugars, proteins, vitamins, and minerals

00:01:41.443 --> 00:01:45.853
that would induce the stem cell 
to develop a neural identity.

00:01:45.853 --> 00:01:49.112
That was only discovered recently, 
in 2013.

00:01:49.112 --> 00:01:51.954
The rest of the process 
is surprisingly easy.

00:01:51.954 --> 00:01:55.034
A neural stem cell essentially 
grows itself,

00:01:55.034 --> 00:01:57.713
similar to how a seed grows into a plant,

00:01:57.713 --> 00:02:01.992
all it needs are the brain’s equivalents 
of soil, water, and sunlight.

00:02:01.992 --> 00:02:04.523
A special gel to simulate 
embryonic tissue,

00:02:04.523 --> 00:02:07.084
a warm incubator set at body temperature,

00:02:07.084 --> 00:02:09.923
and a bit of motion to mimic blood flow.

00:02:09.923 --> 00:02:12.592
The stem cell grows into 
a very small version

00:02:12.592 --> 00:02:15.094
of an early-developing human brain,

00:02:15.094 --> 00:02:17.584
complete with neurons that can connect
to one another

00:02:17.584 --> 00:02:20.714
and make simplified neural networks.

00:02:20.714 --> 00:02:26.075
As mini brains grow, they follow 
all the steps of fetal brain development.

00:02:26.075 --> 00:02:30.026
By observing this process, 
we can learn how our neurons develop,

00:02:30.026 --> 00:02:33.756
as well as how we end up with 
so many more of them in our cortex,

00:02:33.756 --> 00:02:37.754
the part responsible for higher cognition
like logic and reasoning,

00:02:37.754 --> 00:02:39.777
than other species.

00:02:39.777 --> 00:02:42.718
Being able to grow brains in the lab,
even tiny ones,

00:02:42.718 --> 00:02:45.025
raises ethical questions, like:

00:02:45.025 --> 00:02:48.426
Can they think for themselves, 
or develop consciousness?

00:02:48.426 --> 00:02:51.763
And the answer is no, for several reasons.

00:02:51.763 --> 00:02:55.776
A brain organoid has the same tissue types
as a full-sized brain,

00:02:55.776 --> 00:02:58.115
but isn’t organized the same way.

00:02:58.115 --> 00:03:00.066
The organoid is similar to an airplane

00:03:00.066 --> 00:03:03.188
that’s been taken apart 
and reassembled at random;

00:03:03.188 --> 00:03:06.287
you could still study the wings, 
the engine, and other parts,

00:03:06.287 --> 00:03:08.887
but the plane could never fly.

00:03:08.887 --> 00:03:13.246
Similarly, a brain organoid allows us 
to study different types of brain tissue,

00:03:13.246 --> 00:03:15.126
but can’t think.

00:03:15.126 --> 00:03:18.397
And even if mini brains were organized 
like a real brain,

00:03:18.397 --> 00:03:22.417
they still wouldn’t be able 
to reason or develop consciousness.

00:03:22.417 --> 00:03:26.588
A big part of what makes our brains so
smart is their size,

00:03:26.588 --> 00:03:30.064
and mini brains have only 
about 100,000 neurons

00:03:30.064 --> 00:03:34.247
compared to the 86 billion 
in a full-sized brain.

00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:38.735
Scientists aren’t likely to grow larger 
brain organoids anytime soon.

00:03:38.735 --> 00:03:40.527
Without blood vessels to feed them,

00:03:40.527 --> 00:03:44.697
their size is limited 
to one centimeter at most.

00:03:44.697 --> 00:03:48.897
Finally, mini brains aren’t able 
to interact with the outside world.

00:03:48.897 --> 00:03:52.559
We learn by interacting 
with our environments: receiving inputs

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:57.239
through our eyes, ears, and other 
sensory organs, and reacting in turn.

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.057
The complex neural networks that underlie 
conscious thoughts and actions

00:04:01.057 --> 00:04:03.279
develop from this feedback loop.

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:07.859
Without it, the organoids 
can never form a functional network.

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:11.069
There’s nothing quite like 
the actual human brain,

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.860
but mini brains are an unprecedented tool

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.519
for studying everything 
from development to disease.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.901
With luck, these humble 
organoids can help us discover

00:04:20.901 --> 00:04:23.061
what makes the human brain unique,

00:04:23.061 --> 00:04:26.579
and maybe bring us closer 
to answering the age-old question:

00:04:26.579 --> 00:04:28.499
what makes us human?
