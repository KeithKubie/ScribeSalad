00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:03.180
benefit but many of the models that we
 

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:08.030
benefit but many of the models that we
have is that you see the electric grid

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:08.040
have is that you see the electric grid
 

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:13.670

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:19.710
see that the confrontations are becoming
 

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:22.580
see that the confrontations are becoming
more intense but I am an optimistic

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:22.590
more intense but I am an optimistic
 

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:26.810

lived the Cold War the most cruel

00:23:09.199 --> 00:23:09.209
lived the Cold War the most cruel
 

00:23:09.209 --> 00:23:11.789
