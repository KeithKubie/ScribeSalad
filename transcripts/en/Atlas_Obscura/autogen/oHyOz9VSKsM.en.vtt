00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:07.437
- What is the most, Jesus Christ.

00:00:07.437 --> 00:00:09.379
What is the most surprising orifice

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:13.031
from which you have ever removed a coin.

00:00:13.031 --> 00:00:14.281
Oh man, an ear.

00:00:17.213 --> 00:00:19.046
I keep it real simple.

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:21.486
Nice try.

00:00:22.363 --> 00:00:23.661
Hi, my name is Noah.

00:00:23.661 --> 00:00:26.781
We are at the oldest magic store
in New York City: Tannen's.

00:00:26.781 --> 00:00:31.198
And today, I'm answering
questions for Atlas Obscura.

00:00:32.974 --> 00:00:36.057
Why have wands fallen out of fashion?

00:00:36.955 --> 00:00:40.086
What would it take to bring them back?

00:00:40.086 --> 00:00:42.155
I don't know if they're coming back.

00:00:42.155 --> 00:00:44.854
There's one magic trick
I do with a magic wand,

00:00:44.854 --> 00:00:47.304
and I love it cause I
get to go full Potter

00:00:47.304 --> 00:00:49.304
and just like, I don't know.

00:00:49.304 --> 00:00:50.296
It's so much fun.

00:00:50.296 --> 00:00:52.644
But in general, if you
pull a magic wand out,

00:00:52.644 --> 00:00:56.024
it just brings a lot of
associations with it.

00:00:56.024 --> 00:00:58.736
Rabbits and capes and top hats

00:00:58.736 --> 00:01:01.256
and all sorts of shenanigans.

00:01:01.256 --> 00:01:03.646
What's your favorite off-the-shelf trick?

00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:07.755
The Wonder Bubbles is my
favorite off-the-shelf trick.

00:01:07.755 --> 00:01:09.104
You blow bubbles in the air and then

00:01:09.104 --> 00:01:10.564
you reach out and grab one,

00:01:10.564 --> 00:01:13.897
and it turns into a solid ball of glass.

00:01:14.978 --> 00:01:16.934
I love that trick.

00:01:16.934 --> 00:01:18.716
Jesus Christ, ugh.

00:01:18.716 --> 00:01:23.216
Imagine a Venn diagram with
three overlapping circles.

00:01:25.104 --> 00:01:25.937
Okay.

00:01:25.937 --> 00:01:29.614
The first circle is labeled clowns,

00:01:29.614 --> 00:01:34.595
the next, magicians, and
the final circle, comedians.

00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:36.276
How would you label the area

00:01:36.276 --> 00:01:39.025
where all three circles intersect?

00:01:39.025 --> 00:01:40.726
I think I've already ran out of time

00:01:40.726 --> 00:01:43.166
on answering this question.

00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:45.846
Is there anything sold at Tannen's

00:01:45.846 --> 00:01:48.486
that you can't find anywhere else?

00:01:48.486 --> 00:01:50.986
Yes, the Tannen's mystery box.

00:01:52.025 --> 00:01:54.054
The box contains 50 dollars worth

00:01:54.054 --> 00:01:56.073
of incredible magical merchandise.

00:01:56.073 --> 00:01:59.153
You buy it for 25 dollars,
but you don't get to open it

00:01:59.153 --> 00:02:01.414
until after you leave the store,

00:02:01.414 --> 00:02:03.905
so it's always something mysterious.

00:02:03.905 --> 00:02:05.738
It's that right there.

00:02:07.004 --> 00:02:09.754
Should magicians have to register

00:02:10.713 --> 00:02:13.745
with the government like mutants?

00:02:13.745 --> 00:02:15.884
To answer that question,
I would have to reveal

00:02:15.884 --> 00:02:18.865
a number of compromising
pieces of information

00:02:18.865 --> 00:02:21.345
about magicians and their mutant powers

00:02:21.345 --> 00:02:24.545
and/or lack of mutant powers, but no.

00:02:24.545 --> 00:02:27.284
That would defeat the purpose of it.

00:02:27.284 --> 00:02:31.705
Also, it'd just be an
incredibly bureaucratic process.

00:02:31.705 --> 00:02:35.122
What's the scariest thing for a magician?

00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:38.265
Honestly, the scariest
thing for a magician

00:02:38.265 --> 00:02:42.923
is when you meet people who
100% believe magic is real

00:02:42.923 --> 00:02:44.853
and have a million questions for you

00:02:44.853 --> 00:02:46.524
and things they need you to fix

00:02:46.524 --> 00:02:48.265
and hexes they need you to break.

00:02:48.265 --> 00:02:53.133
It's really weird, and there
are those people out there,

00:02:53.133 --> 00:02:55.050
so that's pretty scary.

00:02:56.113 --> 00:02:59.351
How often do you get to wear a cape?

00:02:59.351 --> 00:03:00.601
Come on, never.

00:03:02.237 --> 00:03:03.821
Oh man, what's more difficult.

00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:08.134
Making things disappear or
conjuring things out of thin air?

00:03:08.134 --> 00:03:12.241
Definitely making things
disappear is a lot harder,

00:03:12.241 --> 00:03:14.654
because with making things appear,

00:03:14.654 --> 00:03:17.101
you have the element of surprise.

00:03:17.101 --> 00:03:18.393
When you make something appear,

00:03:18.393 --> 00:03:21.451
by the time the effect has happened,

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:23.593
they didn't know what
to watch for, whereas,

00:03:23.593 --> 00:03:26.031
for something to vanish,
it's almost like a question.

00:03:26.031 --> 00:03:28.948
It just leaves this hanging problem

00:03:29.782 --> 00:03:31.411
of where did the thing go,

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:35.994
so it's a lot harder to do
a really good, clean vanish.

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:39.300
Clowns, magicians, comedians.

00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:44.923
Has there ever been a trick you attempted,

00:03:44.923 --> 00:03:48.090
but it was ultimately too challenging?

00:03:48.931 --> 00:03:51.001
I had this really crazy notion

00:03:51.001 --> 00:03:54.302
of opening up a cardboard box and having

00:03:54.302 --> 00:03:58.681
a single bubble fly
out, just into the air.

00:03:58.681 --> 00:04:03.072
And I got pretty close,
but as it turns out,

00:04:03.072 --> 00:04:06.655
it's very difficult to
get just one bubble.

00:04:08.822 --> 00:04:11.851
Have you ever not found the card?

00:04:11.851 --> 00:04:13.184
Yes, it's rough.

00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:19.382
When you are a magician and
you're doing a magic show,

00:04:19.382 --> 00:04:22.771
people just think it's part of the show,

00:04:22.771 --> 00:04:23.720
so the more you're like,

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.131
"No it just didn't work, let's move on,"

00:04:26.131 --> 00:04:28.222
the more they just think
you're setting them up

00:04:28.222 --> 00:04:30.639
for something else to happen,

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:33.222
so it's very hard to explain to people

00:04:33.222 --> 00:04:36.601
that it really, really did not work.

00:04:36.601 --> 00:04:39.830
How important are physical magic shops,

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.342
like Tannen's, to magicians?

00:04:42.342 --> 00:04:45.030
They are incredibly important.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.262
There's certain skills and things

00:04:47.262 --> 00:04:49.940
that you can't just learn from a video

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.348
or can't just learn from a book.

00:04:52.348 --> 00:04:53.919
And also a place where you can meet

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:56.988
other magicians and exchange ideas.

00:04:56.988 --> 00:04:59.232
I think it's really important to magic

00:04:59.232 --> 00:05:01.070
and to learning that skill.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.541
How easy would it be for
a magician of your caliber

00:05:05.541 --> 00:05:08.291
to sneak a water bottle past TSA?

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:12.232
Part of being a magician is knowing

00:05:12.232 --> 00:05:14.600
when it's worth it and
when it's not worth it.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.900
And I would say, when it comes to TSA,

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.080
just like everybody else,

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.942
I would probably throw
away the water bottle

00:05:19.942 --> 00:05:22.442
and all those kinds of things.

00:05:23.672 --> 00:05:25.320
(laughs)

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.372
I'm gonna have to come back to this one.

00:05:27.372 --> 00:05:31.340
I don't know if I can
think of a good answer.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.698
What precautions does Tannen's take

00:05:33.698 --> 00:05:37.940
to keep skilled magicians
from shoplifting?

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:38.980
What's the expression?

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.249
To catch a thief?

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:43.350
Maybe it's cause they're
good enough to not steal,

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.609
but most likely, I think
they're smart enough

00:05:45.609 --> 00:05:48.830
to know that this is
probably not the best place

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.638
to try to steal things from,

00:05:50.638 --> 00:05:53.568
because you will get caught
and you will get punished

00:05:53.568 --> 00:05:57.235
in creative you couldn't
have even imagined.

00:05:59.112 --> 00:05:59.945
- (off camera) Is there

00:05:59.945 --> 00:06:01.071
an example of a creative punishment?

00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:02.220
- No, we don't really create it.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.911
We just tell them to never come back.

00:06:03.911 --> 00:06:06.120
Yeah, it's pretty basic.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.787
What are you hiding?

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.047
What am I hiding?

00:06:12.882 --> 00:06:15.431
What are we all hiding?

00:06:15.431 --> 00:06:16.514
I don't know.

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:19.492
I don't have that much to hide.

00:06:19.492 --> 00:06:20.665
I think that's one of the fun things

00:06:20.665 --> 00:06:24.214
about being a magician,
is you're very upfront.

00:06:24.214 --> 00:06:25.825
I got a whole bunch of tricky stuff,

00:06:25.825 --> 00:06:27.663
but it's very clear, and then you can just

00:06:27.663 --> 00:06:30.163
be a normal person after that.

00:06:31.663 --> 00:06:32.746
Also, a coin.
