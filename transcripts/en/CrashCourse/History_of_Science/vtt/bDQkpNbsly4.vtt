00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.580
You might have recognized the names of some
of the Greek natural philosophers.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.719
They were individuals with quirky theories,
and we have records about them.

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.480
But they weren’t the only people making
knowledge back in the day.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.590
India had major urban centers, centralized
administrative states, and complicated metaphysical

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.430
traditions long before the Greeks had anything
big—

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.240
just goats, which are small.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.700
And olive trees, which are bigger than goats but still small.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.700
And a few gods and goddesses doing normal
stuff like cheating on each other.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.230
In Indian scriptures, thousands of gods and
demons made perpetual war, destroying and

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.770
recreating reality itself!

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.440
Ancient Indian thinkers didn’t give rise
to the same natural philosophy as

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.940
the Greeks.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.600
India presents a convenient counterpoint to Greece because knowledge-making in india was

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.080
indeparable from a long religious tradition, sponsored by the state,

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.160
and focused on applications.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.680
At the same time, both regions exchanged ideas
with each other and the wider world.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.040
Today we’ll dive into a couple of major
aspects of Indian natural philosophy, underlying

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.890
philosophy–philosophy, and math.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.900
Oh, and we’ll talk about everyone’s favorite
large mammal—the elephant!

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:21.540
[Intro Music Plays]

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.580
Ancient India was home to several schools
of thought, including what would become Hinduism,

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.540
its more austere rivals Buddhism and Jainism,
and a super-fatalistic faith called Ajivika

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.760
that isn’t around anymore.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.040
The most important Hindu texts were the Vedas.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.619
The word “veda” literally means “knowledge.”

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.040
These sacred texts are passed along orally,
even today.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.570
But they had also been written down for centuries
by the time Alexander the Great invaded western

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.810
India in 326 BCE.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.770
Science and religion were entangled in both
Greece and India.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.711
True, the Greek natural philosophers began
to break with a mythological tradition, or

00:01:56.711 --> 00:02:01.080
at least repurposed it, proposing new ways
of thinking about nature.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.910
Even so, we can never neatly separate out
science from religion: they mutually affect

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:06.910
one another.

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.360
In India, “knowledge” systems were essentially,
well, vedic.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.280
The Vedas were written in a sacred language,
Sanskrit, which was standardized around the

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.760
time of the first Greek natural philosophers.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.500
The greatest Sanskrit scholar, Panini, wrote
a book on grammar listing almost four thousand rules!

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.879
These covered phonetics, meter, semantics,
etymology—everything about the language

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.340
and how it should be used.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.670
In fact, Panini’s theory of how words are
formed was so advanced that it was directly

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.709
studied into the twentieth century!

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.219
So you can say that the first science in India
was linguistics.

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:45.519
And this tradition of memorizing the Vedas
and trying to understand words eventually

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.260
led to the study of acoustics and musical
tones.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.239
But is studying a language, which is a very
human thing, the same kind of knowledge-making

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.299
as studying fire or gravity?

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:56.499
Yes, totally!

00:02:56.499 --> 00:03:01.750
Linguists make hypotheses, take careful observations,
and put together testable theories about how

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.819
languages change.

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.409
They might be frustrated by the seeming randomness
of their subjects… but then again, so are

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.749
quantum physicists, and medical doctors!

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:12.720
Some parts of the Vedas concerned math and
astronomy.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.060
But mostly they concerned gods and rituals.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.469
The Vedas taught that the cosmos is clearly
ordered, as is human society.

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:25.629
What happens in the reality you perceive is
the result of a complicated ethical algorithm

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:30.069
running in the background—so you have to
sacrifice a lot of animals and stay in your

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:31.069
social position.

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.689
Thus the Vedas functioned not only as a basis
for a whole language, but as a way of teaching

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:41.520
people how society should be: a mirror of
an orderly cosmos.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.420
And so we arrive at the present year: 321
BCE…

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.080
It’s not actually 321.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.699
But it was, at one point.

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:53.730
At that time, in Greece, Aristotle had been
dead for only one year.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.199
Over in Babylon, in what is now Iraq, Aristotle’s
former boss Alexander the Great had been dead

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:59.200
for two years.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.199
But in eastern India, a young adventurer named
Chandragupta Maurya was very

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:08.739
much alive: that year he became emperor of
nearly the entire subcontinent.

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.310
Alexander had only recently invaded India,
wisely choosing not to start beef with the

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.079
powerful kingdom of Magadha.

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:19.320
When Alexander died, India consisted of a
lot of small kingdoms.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.750
Maurya, inspired by the model of Alexander
and coached by a brilliant older adviser,

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.160
led a coup in Magadha.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.670
From there, Maurya conquered the weaker kingdoms
one by one, forging them into a powerful state

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.440
called —wait for it, what name did he name it?

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.060
who knows!— it's the Maurya Empire.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.310
The dynasty that Maurya founded lasted from
322 to 180 BCE.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.960
It sponsored research into astronomy, hydraulic
engineering, and forestry.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.060
Chandragupta’s grandson Ashoka 
became one of the most powerful and culturally

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.130
influential rulers of India, as well as a
serious convert to Buddhism.

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:00.780
He outlawed hunting and other unnecessary
acts of violence towards animals, opened public

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.540
hospitals, and spread Buddhism as far as Athens!

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.820
When the Buddhist monk Faxian 
visited India from Jin Dynasty China, starting

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:14.560
in 399 CE, he favorably compared the two empires:
both were civilized societies where Buddhism

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.200
could flourish.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.200
Increased travel between states brought increased
trade in goods as well as ideas.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.450
Under the Maurya Empire, more than half of
the arable land in ancient India was irrigated,

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.530
producing two harvests a year.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.470
That sustained a lot of people… and required
a lot of planning.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.270
Thus Indian states developed whole government
departments to supervise the building and

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.360
maintenance of irrigation systems.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.590
They controlled a vast system of canals and
sluices, funded by taxes.

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.250
Breaching a dam was punishable… by death!

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:52.020
The centralized Maurya Empire—like the Egyptian,
Sumerian, and Chinese ones—was a “hydraulic”

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:58.000
state: its control of water allowed harvests
stability, keeping large populations alive.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.280
To control nature, the people running these
big states needed to know lots of things about

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.090
the lands, plants, animals and especially
rivers they controlled.

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.830
And most especially about the people who owed
them taxes.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.960
First rule of history: nobody ever, ever liked
paying taxes.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.200
Another key to running a big state in India
was the elephant.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.340
Training hundreds of war elephants was important
to continued military power.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:26.780
So the Mauryas created a forestry department,
because elephants lived in the forests, and

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.780
made the slaying of elephants punishable by,
you guessed it, death.

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.950
Forestry management and regulating land and
water would eventually develop into sciences

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:35.950
in their own right.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.360
The Mauryas’ administrative or “useful”
science, such as their pioneering work in

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:45.580
land management, was not the same as the abstract
theorizing of the Greek natural philosophers.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:50.560
The Greeks left behind their names, thanks
to their writings and their cults—I mean—schools.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.961
The work of those who maintained early hydraulic
states tended to be anonymous.

00:06:53.961 --> 00:07:00.490
A debate about the relative merits of applied
versus pure science—knowledge of the immediately

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.610
useful versus the abstractly true—is still
raging today.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.250
Just compare a scientist applying for a grant
to study, say, lichen versus an engineer working

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.020
on computer guidance for missiles…

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:16.370
But useful and abstract systems are not diametric
opposites, and they were never fully separate.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:20.639
India had been open to Persian and Chinese
influences before Alexander.

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:25.889
The Chinese had already introduced alchemy—or
systematic questioning about what is stuff—to

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:26.889
Indian thought.

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:31.800
But India definitely became more Greek-ish
when a bunch of Greeks–some trained by Aristotle

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.520
himself—pranced in talking about elements
and perfectly circular star-paths.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.220
Astronomy was important to all of the ancient
states.

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:44.070
This is because, alongside their war-making
and tax-taking, states were also religious

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:46.690
institutes, which cared about astrological
schedules.

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:51.050
Because, if you’re a god, you can fly around
the heavens, you have houses in different

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:54.740
parts of the sky, and you want to be worshipped
when you’re in the right house.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:59.950
In India, as all over the ancient world, “religion”
and “science” were not separate ideas

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:02.180
in the way we might think of them today.

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:07.610
Practicing astrology meant carefully observing
stars and planets—and thus also practicing

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:08.610
astronomy.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:12.950
People who knew a lot about the night sky
made up a high-status professional class.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:17.410
These stargazers were part-priest, part-astronomer,
and part-mathematician.

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:21.620
As astronomers, they divided the solar year
into months, crafting calendars to regulate

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:22.650
religious ceremonies.

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:27.460
They developed a calculation for adding a
leap month when necessary to keep the religious

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.940
calendar in sync with the solar one.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.680
And they investigated the moon’s cycles,
as well as constellations.

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:38.399
As mathematicians, they came up with names
for very large numbers—such as 10 to the

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:43.380
40th—related to the very long cosmic cycles
in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.620
In fact, astronomy and related math really
took off in ancient India.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.310
Let’s take a closer look with ThoughtBubble:

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:58.620
During the Gupta Empire, which lasted from
319 to 605 CE, families of professional astronomer–mathematicians

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.300
passed down their teachings about the stars.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:07.290
And they competed with each other: six regional
schools of thought all fought for state patronage.

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:12.149
This period also saw the rise of the siddhantas
or “the solutions,” meaning high-level

00:09:12.149 --> 00:09:13.570
astronomy textbooks.

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:18.360
Two of the major siddhanta writers were Aryabhata and Brahmagupta.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.400
They were both brilliant polymaths,

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.769
but unfortunately they disagreed about astronomy.

00:09:22.769 --> 00:09:27.730
Which was really too bad, because these guys
would have made a team of unbeatable geniuses.

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:34.180
Written around 500 CE, Aryabhata’s book
of solutions includes a place-value system,

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:39.699
decimal notation, the familiar numbers that
we call “Arabic” today, the number zero,

00:09:39.699 --> 00:09:43.199
and the irrational number pi calculated to
four places.

00:09:43.199 --> 00:09:48.150
And Aryabhata famously posited that the earth
rotates… daily… on its axis.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:52.790
This idea was a major breakthrough in astronomy:
Egyptian, Greek, and earlier Indian thinkers

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:55.620
argued that the sky rotates around the earth.

00:09:55.620 --> 00:10:00.490
Aryabhata figured out that the apparent “movement”
of the stars is actually caused by the rotation

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:01.779
of the earth itself.

00:10:01.779 --> 00:10:06.490
But Brahmagupta thought that a rotating earth
defied common sense: just look at the birds,

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:08.470
all not flying off into the heavens!

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:13.139
Meanwhile, in his own siddhanta, Brahmagupta
calculated the circumference of the earth

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:18.740
with astonishing precision, and he worked
with negative and irrational numbers.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.200
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:10:20.209 --> 00:10:24.339
Indian mathematicians were working on many
topics that writers in Greece were not.

00:10:24.339 --> 00:10:29.230
But the most advanced branch of natural philosophy
in ancient India was more founded in Vedic

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:30.230
teachings.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:35.869
Ayurveda, literally life-knowledge,
or the science of life, began with oral traditions

00:10:35.869 --> 00:10:37.660
about sacrificial animals.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:43.180
By the sixth century BCE, it was a standardized
system of medicine and way of answering the

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:44.819
question what is life?

00:10:44.819 --> 00:10:48.449
Ayurvedic approaches to diseases and cures
were rational.

00:10:48.449 --> 00:10:50.319
There were reasons for every choice.

00:10:50.319 --> 00:10:55.720
Good physicians didn’t believe in strictly
divine cures, but practiced medical judgment

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.029
based on years of study and then more years
of experience.

00:10:59.029 --> 00:11:04.440
The influential medical textbook Charaka Samhita,
for example, calls for physicians to apprentice

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:08.490
with a master, then get royal permission to
treat patients.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:14.970
It also lists 300 bones, 500 muscles, 210
joints, and 70 vessels in the human body.

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.589
This was written some time before 200 CE.

00:11:17.589 --> 00:11:20.779
And today’s med school students complain
about organic chemistry!

00:11:20.779 --> 00:11:25.360
Ayurveda, which is still around today, is
so complex and important that we’re devoting

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.559
another episode to it, alongside ancient European
medicine.

00:11:28.559 --> 00:11:32.959
For now, just note that, Indian medicine and
surgery was probably the most advanced of

00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:34.819
any contemporary ancient civilization.

00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:37.980
Rich in people and faiths, India was not a

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:42.129
single culture even under the highly successful
Mauryas and Guptas.

00:11:42.129 --> 00:11:45.690
But certain features of ancient Indian natural
philosophy stand out.

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:51.480
The ancient Vedas—literally, the knowledges—influenced
a wide variety of thinkers across a large

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.149
geographic region.

00:11:53.149 --> 00:11:57.860
There were no sharp breaks with Vedic ways
of knowing—although Buddhism, and influences

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:02.709
from China and Greece, added new layers of
philosophy on top of the Vedic one.

00:12:02.709 --> 00:12:07.420
And the Maurya and Gupta states were wealthy
and well-administered, known for their skilled

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:11.850
artisans and able to control vast plains in
order to feed teeming cities.

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:18.140
As ancient states exchanged goods and proto-scientific
ideas, Indian ideas spread far and wide: we

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:22.769
have accounts of Ayurvedic physicians, or
vaidyas, working in eighth-century

00:12:22.769 --> 00:12:27.600
Baghdad, then one of the largest cities on
earth and a center of knowledge production.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:34.540
Next time—we’ll travel to The Americas to ask questions like, "When are we? What is time? And how to we measure it?"

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:38.509
Crash Course History of Science is filmed
in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney studio in Missoula,

00:12:38.509 --> 00:12:42.759
Montana and it’s made with the help of all
this nice people and our animation team is

00:12:42.759 --> 00:12:43.759
Thought Cafe.

00:12:43.759 --> 00:12:45.350
Crash Course is a Complexly production.

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:49.279
