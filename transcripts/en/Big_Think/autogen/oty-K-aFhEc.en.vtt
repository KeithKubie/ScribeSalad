psychology got its start from the

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520
psychology got its start from the
 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.840
psychology got its start from the
awareness that the field was focused too

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850
awareness that the field was focused too
 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:14.740

weaknesses and not their strengths and

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010
weaknesses and not their strengths and
 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.760
weaknesses and not their strengths and
so Martin Seligman and Chris Peterson

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770
so Martin Seligman and Chris Peterson
 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.120
so Martin Seligman and Chris Peterson
worked to shift the way psychology is

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130
worked to shift the way psychology is
 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.190

practiced rather than think of someone
 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.260
practiced rather than think of someone
and their problems we think of someone

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270
and their problems we think of someone
 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.840
and their problems we think of someone
and their strengths and we try to

and their strengths and we try to
 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.449
and their strengths and we try to
develop those strengths try to see the

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459
develop those strengths try to see the
 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.210
develop those strengths try to see the
best in people because everybody has

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220

signature strengths and we want to focus
and help them develop those and in

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050
and help them develop those and in
 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.520
and help them develop those and in
developing those it helps to shore up

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530
developing those it helps to shore up
 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.600

setting expanding on the inventory we
try to apply the same characteristics

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160
try to apply the same characteristics
 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.050
try to apply the same characteristics
that are articulated for individuals but

that are articulated for individuals but
 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.060
that are articulated for individuals but
we try to put them into practice in a

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070
we try to put them into practice in a
 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.280
we try to put them into practice in a
communal setting and in a communal

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290
