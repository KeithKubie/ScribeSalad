00:00:00.212 --> 00:00:02.215
- [Instructor] The four
corners of a rectangle

00:00:02.215 --> 00:00:06.382
are located at the points
(11,7), (11,0), (2,0),

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.452
and (2,7).

00:00:09.452 --> 00:00:12.391
Plot the four corners of the
rectangle on the coordinate

00:00:12.391 --> 00:00:14.196
plane below, and they have these dots

00:00:14.196 --> 00:00:17.000
and we can actually move these
around for the four corners

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.497
of our rectangle.

00:00:18.497 --> 00:00:22.817
So let's look at this first point: (11,7).

00:00:22.817 --> 00:00:25.056
Where will that go?

00:00:25.056 --> 00:00:27.884
Well let's just remind
ourselves that the first

00:00:27.884 --> 00:00:31.275
coordinate here, that is our x-coordinate.

00:00:31.275 --> 00:00:35.257
That tells us how far we
move in the x-direction,

00:00:35.257 --> 00:00:37.584
or how far we move to the right.

00:00:37.584 --> 00:00:40.040
So our x-coordinate is 11, so we can say,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.881
we can start at the origin
and move 11 to the right

00:00:43.881 --> 00:00:46.362
and then our y-coordinate
is seven, which says hey

00:00:46.362 --> 00:00:48.381
we need to move seven up from there.

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:51.964
So one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

00:00:54.773 --> 00:00:57.908
So notice, 11, that's if
you were to just drop a line

00:00:57.908 --> 00:01:00.584
straight down you would
hit the x-axis at 11

00:01:00.584 --> 00:01:03.382
and the y-coordinate, if you
were to take a horizontal

00:01:03.382 --> 00:01:05.106
line, if you were to go
straight to the left,

00:01:05.106 --> 00:01:06.900
you get to y equals seven.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.866
So this is the point (11,7).

00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:11.614
Alright let's do the next one.

00:01:11.614 --> 00:01:14.374
Then you have (11,0).

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:16.571
So let's line, lemme take
this point right over here.

00:01:16.571 --> 00:01:19.648
So the x-coordinate is once
again 11, but the y-coordinate

00:01:19.648 --> 00:01:23.437
is zero, which means we don't
move up at all in the ...

00:01:23.437 --> 00:01:24.942
Or we don't move up at all.

00:01:24.942 --> 00:01:27.577
One way to think about
it, start at the origin,

00:01:27.577 --> 00:01:31.484
you move 11 to the right
and you move zero up.

00:01:31.484 --> 00:01:33.868
So this is going to sit on
the x-axis right over there

00:01:33.868 --> 00:01:35.865
(11,0).

00:01:35.865 --> 00:01:39.121
Alright then we have (2,0).

00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:43.326
So x-coordinate is two and
we don't move up at all.

00:01:43.326 --> 00:01:46.362
So we're gonna sit on the x-axis.

00:01:46.362 --> 00:01:48.260
We move two to the right and zero up,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.534
or you can think of it zero
up and two to the right.

00:01:51.534 --> 00:01:54.476
Then we have (2,7).

00:01:54.476 --> 00:01:57.878
So x-coordinate is two,
but then we wanna move ...

00:01:57.878 --> 00:02:00.914
X-coordinate is two, then
we wanna move seven up

00:02:00.914 --> 00:02:03.402
to get right over there,
and so you can see

00:02:03.402 --> 00:02:06.483
the corners of a rectangle right over here

00:02:06.483 --> 00:02:10.925
and then they ask us, what is
the height of the rectangle?

00:02:10.925 --> 00:02:12.195
Well let's see.

00:02:12.195 --> 00:02:16.822
If we're going from y equals
zero to y equals seven,

00:02:16.822 --> 00:02:17.877
so the height is seven.

00:02:17.877 --> 00:02:20.764
You could even count it,
one, two, three, four,

00:02:20.764 --> 00:02:22.372
five, six, seven.

00:02:22.372 --> 00:02:25.484
So the height of the rectangle is seven.

00:02:25.484 --> 00:02:28.247
And then of course I can check my answer

00:02:28.247 --> 00:02:29.830
and I got it right.
