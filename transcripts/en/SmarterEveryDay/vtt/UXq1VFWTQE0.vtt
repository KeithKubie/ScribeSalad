Announcing ThinkerCon, remember several years ago five of us educational content creators got together and we did this live events

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.880
It was really fun, but people came from like 40 states and 12 different nations for it

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.109
So clearly there's a lot of demand for this sort of thing. We're gonna do something similar only much bigger

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.359
There were five content creators at that event

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.919
There's going to be 20 times that at what we're doing here and they're not just youtubers. They're

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.470
podcasters makers artists

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.379
explorable content online people that make

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.160
educational content for the masses it's a celebration of

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.780
Educational content which is something we need in the world today ThinkerCon has all the information you need Hotel

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.540
Information where to fly in to November 17 2018 a one-night celebration of educational content online

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.309
I apologize if there are no tickets left by the time you get to the website

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.329
This is gonna be a really cool night. For example, there's a Saturn 5 rocket hanging from the ceiling

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.558
We're gonna feed you a full-on German meal under that rocket will explain the German bit. Later

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.079
But you can do that and then after that you can go down to the amphitheater

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.858
There's gonna be a really cool variety show hosted by the festival the spoken nerd from the UK

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.299
You can come back in under the rocket and hang out with some of the other educational content creators in the rooms

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.409
There's people from all over the internet that do all different types of educational content

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:17.669
Which is really cool because YouTube is sponsoring the event now one of the top priorities for YouTube is education

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.689
So I think it's cool that they're sponsoring event where people are just doing education online. So I'll let Malik explain this to you
