THERE IS NO SECRET THAT I LOVE
AMERICA, THAT IS WHY NO ONE

00:00:02.635 --> 00:00:05.972 align:start size:97% position:3%
ASKED ME TO THE SAIDEE HAWKINS
DANCE IN HIGH SCHOOL.

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:08.775
THEY KNEW I ALREADY HAD A DATE.

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:11.344 align:start size:94% position:6%
BUT LATELY AMERICA HAS BEEN
CHANGING.

00:00:11.377 --> 00:00:14.781
SHE IS NOT THE 1950S BEAUTY THAT
I USED TO LOVE BACK WHEN I WAS

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:16.849
WAITING TO BE BORN.

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:18.083
NO.

00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:25.491
TO BE HONEST, SOMETIMES I DON'T
EVEN RECOGNIZE MY COUNTRY ANY

00:00:25.524 --> 00:00:27.193
MORE.

00:00:27.226 --> 00:00:29.796 align:start size:91% position:9%
MY FIRST FADING MEMORY IS
FOOTBALL.

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:32.765
YESTERDAY WAS THE SUPER BOWL
WHICH WAS RUINED WHEN THIS POP

00:00:32.798 --> 00:00:38.471
LOCKING MOUNTAIN RANGE JUSTIN
TIMBERLAKE DID A HALFTIME SHOW.

00:00:38.504 --> 00:00:44.777
THIS ELITIST CUCK SHOULDN'T BE A
THREUD DO IS AM MICHAEL JACKSON

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.146
COSPLAY AROUND A FOOTBALL FIELD
AFTER WHAT HE SAID TO REPORTERS

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:50.716
LAST WEEK WHEN THEY ASKED HIM IF
HIS SON MIGHT PLAY FOOTBALL ONE

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:51.517
DAY.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.253 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; HE WILL NEVER PLAY FOOTBALL,
NO.

00:00:54.286 --> 00:00:57.223
&gt;&gt; TO SAY MY KID CAN'T PLAY
FOOTBALL BECAUSE I'M WORRIED HE

00:00:57.256 --> 00:01:00.059
MIGHT TAKE A HIT IT IS
INDICATIVE OF THE SOFTNESS WE

00:01:00.092 --> 00:01:01.327
GET.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.296
TO ME IT IS AN EYE ROLL, HERE WE
GO AGAIN, ANOTHER GUY THAT WON'T

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.864
LET HIS KID PLAY FOOTBALL.

00:01:04.897 --> 00:01:06.632
&gt;&gt; Jordan: YEAH, YEAH.

00:01:06.665 --> 00:01:08.301
HERE WE GO AGAIN.

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:12.105
HE DOESN'T JUST LOOK LIKE THE
GUY WHO BROKE MOLLY RINGWALD'S

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:15.575 align:start position:0%
HEART AT THE BEGINNING OF EVERY
8 0SEE MOVIE, NO HE MAKES A

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:16.776
GREAT POINT.

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:19.479 align:start position:0%
I HEAR THINGS LIKE 48 PERCENT OF
AMERICANS WOULD ENCOURAGE A

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:21.881 align:start size:88% position:13%
CHILD WHO WANTED TO PLAY
FOOTBALL TO PLAY A DIFFERENT

00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:24.083 align:start size:94% position:6%
SPORT DUE TO CONCERNS ABOUT
CONCUSSION.

00:01:24.116 --> 00:01:26.652 align:start position:0%
AND I WONDER, WHERE THE HELL AM
I?

00:01:26.685 --> 00:01:30.256
I HIT MY HEAD AND I'M NOW HALL
USE NATURING AN AMERICA WHERE

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:32.925
PEOPLE AREN'T EXCITED TO SEND
THEIR TOTS OFF TO BATTLE ON THE

00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.093
GRID IRON?

00:01:34.126 --> 00:01:35.495
WHO CARES.

00:01:35.528 --> 00:01:39.866
PLAYERS RISK TURNING THEIR
BRAINS INTO DECONSTRUCTED

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:40.533
LASAGNA.

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:45.972
THEY DO IT FOR A GOOD CAUSE.

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:48.374 align:start size:94% position:6%
THEY GET SNEAKERS WITH THEIR
NAMES ON THEM!

00:01:48.407 --> 00:01:50.743 align:start position:0%
BUT SOME FATHERS ARE JUST WUSSES
WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND A THING

00:01:50.776 --> 00:01:51.977
ABOUT FOOTBALL.

00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:58.417 align:start size:97% position:3%
WEAK, PENNY WASTES LIKE JUSTIN
TIMBERLAKE AND MIKE DIT KA.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.622 align:start position:0%
-- TYPICAL, MID WESTERN COASTAL
ELITE.

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:03.990
IF THIS CONTINUES, WHAT IS NEXT.

00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:07.426
KIDS PLAYING BASKETBALL WRAPPED
IN BUBBLE WRAP, DIVERS LAND NGHT

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:10.029
BALL PIT FROM DAVE &amp; BUSTERS.

00:02:10.062 --> 00:02:14.700
PEOPLE PLAYING SOCCER.

00:02:14.733 --> 00:02:18.704 align:start size:66% position:34%
(LAUGHTER)
IT MAKES ME SICK.

00:02:18.737 --> 00:02:20.740 align:start size:97% position:3%
THIS ISN'T EVEN MY COUNTRY ANY
MORE.

00:02:20.773 --> 00:02:24.844
AND IT'S NOT JUST FOOTBALL, NO
WE MAY LOSE OUR GREAT AMERICAN

00:02:24.877 --> 00:02:25.878
PASTTIME.

00:02:25.912 --> 00:02:30.683 align:start size:94% position:6%
NO, NOT BASEBALL, BOWL BULL
INDIGENOUS PEOPLE.

00:02:30.716 --> 00:02:34.487
WE COMBINE BOTH OF THESE
PASSIONS IN THE CLEVELAND

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.721
INDIANS.

00:02:35.755 --> 00:02:38.191
HOWEVER, INSTEAD   I SAID IT
BEFORE, AMERICA IS CHANGING AND

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:39.325
I DON'T LIKE IT.

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:42.094
&gt;&gt; THE CLEVELAND INDIANS
ANNOUNCED THE REMOVAL OF THEIR

00:02:42.127 --> 00:02:45.364
CONTROVERSIAL CHIEF WAHOO LOGO
FROM CAPS AND JERSEYS STARTING

00:02:45.397 --> 00:02:46.432
IN 2019.

00:02:46.465 --> 00:02:49.235 align:start size:91% position:9%
&gt;&gt; MANY GROUPS CONSIDER IT
RACIST AND OFFENSIVE.

00:02:49.268 --> 00:02:53.039
&gt;&gt; I THINK THEY FINALLY CAVED.

00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:57.777 align:start size:97% position:3%
1947 WE HAVE BEEN SEEING CHIEF
WAHOO AS A LOGO.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.544
PART OF THE MOVIE MAJOR LEAGUE.

00:02:58.577 --> 00:02:59.712
&gt;&gt; Jordan: YEAH, HE WAS.

00:02:59.745 --> 00:03:02.114 align:start size:91% position:9%
CHIEF WAHOO WAS IN "MAJOR
LEAGUE" AND EVERYONE IN THAT

00:03:02.147 --> 00:03:07.153 align:start size:94% position:6%
MOVIE IS STILL STANDING PROU
(LAUGHTER)

00:03:07.186 --> 00:03:10.790
BUT THE SNOWFLAKES WANT TO
COMPLETELY DISREGARD THE TEAM'S

00:03:10.823 --> 00:03:11.824
LEGACY.

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:13.693 align:start size:88% position:13%
SORRY LIBS THEY ARE THE
CLEVELAND INDIANS AND THEY

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:14.927
ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.

00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:17.730
EXCEPT WHEN THEY WERE A MINOR
LEAGUE TEAM CALLED THE CLEAF

00:03:17.763 --> 00:03:20.766
LAND LAKESHORES, AND A YEAR
LATER WHEN THEY WERE RENAMED THE

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.768
CLEVELAND BLUE BIRDSnd A
YEAR AFTER THAT THEY PRT

00:03:22.801 --> 00:03:24.604
CLEVELAND BRONCOS.

00:03:24.637 --> 00:03:26.872
AND THE NEXT YEAR THEY WERE
NAMED THE CLEEF LATH AND THEN

00:03:26.905 --> 00:03:31.210
THE CLEVELAND MILLIONEE MAGUIRES
WHICH IS VERY, VERY CONFUSING.

00:03:31.243 --> 00:03:33.746 align:start size:88% position:13%
BUT THEN THEY BECAME THE
CLEVELAND INDIANS.

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:37.350 align:start size:97% position:3%
SO HOW CAN WE POSSIBLY CHANGE
IT!

00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:40.086
THIS IS ANOTHER CASE OF LIBS
FROTHING AT THE MOUTH TRYING TO

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:41.487
TAKE AWAY OUR HISTORY.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.721
WHAT IS NEXT.

00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:47.026
TAKING AWAY OUR CONFEDERATE
STATUES AND TODDLER SIGNIFICANT

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:48.494
ARS.

00:03:48.527 --> 00:03:53.933
-- CIGARS, WHICH ARE-- WHILE
WE'RE ON THE SUBJECT, THEY ARE

00:03:53.966 --> 00:03:56.369 align:start size:97% position:3%
TEMPORARILY STILL AVAILABLE IN
THE SHOPPOSITION.

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:57.770
THIS IS NOT THE AMERICA I KNOW.

00:03:57.803 --> 00:03:59.105
BUT WE'RE NOT DONE.

00:03:59.138 --> 00:04:01.807
PREPARE TO LOSE YOUR APPETITE.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.879 align:start size:97% position:3%
BECAUSE CONCERN EL SANDERS IS

FIRST FEMALE TO TAKE OVER THE

00:04:14.887 --> 00:04:15.855
ROLE.

00:04:15.888 --> 00:04:17.957 align:start position:0%
A LOT OF COMMENTS, I WILL LEAVE

00:04:31.837 --> 00:04:34.807
(LAUGHTER)
BUT A WOMAN JUST DOESN'T HAVE

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.743
THE STAMINA TO BE THE COLONEL.

00:04:37.776 --> 00:04:41.180 align:start position:0%
WE NEED SOMEONE STRONG AND TOUGH
TO GUARD THE SECRET SPICE.

00:04:41.213 --> 00:04:44.083
WHAND IS WITH THE PANTSUIT AND
SHORT COIFFED HAIR T IS LIKE

STOP IT, REBBA GO BACK TO THE
WOODS AND RELEASE YOUR EMAILS!

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.224 align:start size:97% position:3%
THIS CAN'T BE AMERICA, IT JUST

00:04:52.257 --> 00:04:55.728
IT'S-- GET ME OUT OF IT CHUCK,
GIVE ME A LAND I CAN RECOGNIZE,

00:04:55.761 --> 00:04:57.663 align:start size:97% position:3%
DO GUNS STILL OUTNUMBER PEOPLE

00:04:57.696 --> 00:04:58.864

00:04:58.897 --> 00:04:59.865
&gt;&gt; Jordan: GOOD.

00:04:59.898 --> 00:05:04.270 align:start size:97% position:3%
CAN YOU STILL GET A ROOT CANAL

00:05:04.837 --> 00:05:05.938
&gt;&gt; Jordan: PERFECT.

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:08.507 align:start size:94% position:6%
DO MORE PEOPLE STILL LIVE IN
PRISON THAN IN WYOMING?

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.577 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THEN WYOMING AND SOUTH DAKOTA
COMBINED.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.015

00:05:16.048 --> 00:05:16.716
