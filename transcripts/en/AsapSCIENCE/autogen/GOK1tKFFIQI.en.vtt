00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.720
 With more than 350 million people suffering from depression in the world, it is undoubtedly a subject 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.640
 Serious and dangerous. But what exactly is happening to a person with depression? Is there 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.970
 A biological reason for those strong feelings of sadness? 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:19.289
 In the past, depression was described as a "chemical imbalance" in the brain. And identification 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.609
 Scientists believed that the cause was a decrease in the amount of neurotransmitter "serotonin" which is often called 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.949
 "Happiness hormone". But the only evidence on this was that when 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.300
 Some people described drugs that raise the rate of "serotonin" 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.430
 This helped them ease their symptoms. Although chemical vectors have a definite role to play, however 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.290
 This vision does not fully show the complexity of the disease. In recent years, scientists have begun 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.790
 They note that the size and links of brain cells can play a role 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:45.250
 Larger. 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.930
 When we look at the brain of a person with depression, studies show that the hippocampus tends to be 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.020
 Significantly smaller than usual. Other areas of the brain are also affected. 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.789
 But this area (hippocampus) controls memory and emotions. The longer the person's suffering, the longer 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:03.140
 Depression, the smaller the size of the hippocampus. Cells and networks are literally destroyed. 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.649
 Stress has been shown to be a major cause of the decline in the number of new neurons 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:10.700
 In this region of the brain. Studies have shown that when this region of the brain is renewed 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.840
 New neurons are stimulated, mood improves. Interestingly, many drugs 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.090
 Modern ones, including those that affect serotonin rate, have an indirect effect on large size 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.389
 Brain cells. This probably explains why serotonin-containing drugs help some patients - but for reasons 

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:29.729
 Different from what we thought. It also stimulates the release of other chemical vectors 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.369
 It stimulates the formation and growth of new neurons, and by knowing this some 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.869
 Scientists now believe that the focus should be on drugs that directly affect the formation of new neurons. 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.779
 Although neurons and hormones are the main influencing factors, many have been discovered 

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:46.919
 Genetic factors also. One research confirms that there is variation in the gene 

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:52.079
 Responsible for the transmission of serotonin makes the individual more susceptible to depression. Each individual has two copies of 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.340
 This gene - one from the father and the other from the mother. They can be either short or long 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.259
 After tracking 800 young adults for more than 5 years. Studies have shown that 33% of individuals 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.759
 Those with one short version of the gene have been depressed after stressful life events - and people who have 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.899
 Two short copies of the gene were worse off. On the other hand, people with two long copies of the gene were 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.840
 Are less likely to have depression with similar stress in life. Many have been selected 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.840
 Other genes that increase the likelihood of depression. This is logical when 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.510
 Keep in mind that depression and bipolar disorder occur in families. Studies have shown on 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.709
 Twins that if one of them suffer from bipolar disorder, the other face the possibility of infection 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:28.540
 By 60-80% 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.870
 Therefore, although the real cause or symptoms of depression have not been fully identified - they have believed that 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.430
 There is a huge list of other variables that studies suggest they play a role in this - 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.629
 It is necessary to remember that depression is a disease with a biological basis, in addition to 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:46.209
 Psychological and social effects. It is not simply a vulnerability that a person must 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.819
 "Beyond" or even something we can control, such as heart disease or cancer 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.040
 The highlight of this topic is of paramount importance, in order to obtain 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.549
 On funding and appropriate research. 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.599
 But is depression just a human phenomenon? We discussed the question: "Do dogs get depressed?" 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.769
 In another video from AsapTHOUGHT, we discovered several studies conducted to understand depression 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.040
 Among other types, including domestic pets. You can click the link in the details box
