Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number one 86 with me, Jocko Willink.

Speaker 1:          00:00:07       Among the newly minted Special Forces soldiers were Douglas El Latino, a skinny hundred and 35 pound California cowboy, John Shore, a blonde haired, slightly overweight baby faced kid from Georgia and frank mccloskey, a tough combat hardened veteran of the a hundred first airborne division. Mccloskey arrived sporting seepage from a wound in the back of his head. This trio of green berets had completed their special forces in country training program and not train the Fifth Special Forces Group headquarters. When a sergeant not training asked for Special Forces soldiers to volunteer for a secret project, they raised their hands in short order. They were flown to fob four in the northern sector of South Vietnam. ICORE upon reporting in, they were told Camp Commander Colonel Jack Warren would brief them in the morning on the CNC mission in Southeast Asia. Finally, after more than a year of training for Laterno, the game was on how much better could this get? It seems all his life he'd been preparing for this moment from riding rodeo Bronx and breaking nearly every bone in his body. To wrangling animals for television shows like Dak Tare and cowboy in Africa starring Chuck Connors. Laterno knew a little bit about taking a calculated risk.

Speaker 2:          00:01:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:41       And after he had gotten his hands on Robin Moore's book, the Green Berets, he knew this was for him. Guerrilla warfare. Check, counterinsurgency training, check unconventional warfare, check return. Oh, couldn't wait to write his own story that he could someday share with his dad a world war to be 17 pilot and former POW. Nothing, however could have prepared him for the site that greeted him as he entered the transient barracks there etched onto the concrete floor and forever in his memory was the chart outline of a man's body, a grizzly reminder of the 23 August, 1968 attack on fob for that fateful evening, north Vietnamese sappers and Vietcong operatives killed 18 green berets in a carefully executed sneak attack. The deadly side of gorilla warfare was brought home to him right there. He was in a war zone. The enemy didn't play by any set rules. It was an unsettling event.

Speaker 1:          00:02:48       The next morning after breakfast, the trio walked over to s three and chose their code names. The Tourneau mccloskey and shore now became the Frenchmen, nam, Mu, and bubba names that would stick with them far beyond their tours of duty in Vietnam because S3 was temporarily located in the headquarters section of fob four since the attack, it was a quick shuffle into the briefing room with everyone else, an intense short, an intense short black haired man wearing pajamas slippers and a bathrobe walked in smoking a cigarette before a word was spoken. Colonel Warren abruptly pulled a white sheet off a large map with a flourish and tossed it aside and announced. Welcome to C and C men turning to the large map that had black tape boxed target, deadly designators on in Laos, the DMZ and north Vietnam. He continued. This is what you volunteered for. This is why this is a top secret project.

Speaker 1:          00:03:48       If anybody asks, the president can say, we have no men stationed in the AOE. That is why you'll wear sterile fatigues and carry no form of identification of any kind on your missions. That's why you agreed not to talk to anyone about this operation. For at least 20 years, our Intel reports land in the White House. Any questions? Not Waiting for a response. Warn continued to explain the difference between spike teams and hatchet force elements where the different fops were located. How fob three at case on was closed after the siege earlier in the year and how major Clyde's sincere jr had opened a site at my lock now designated fob three following an update on intelligence reports in the respective areas of operations. Colonel Warren asked if anyone had any questions. The turno raised his hand. Where do you need help, sir? We need men at fob one we lost a one zero on October 5th and some of the first special forces, TDY troops from Okinawa are returning back to the island, the turnoff short turn to shore and mccloskey and asked, how about it fob?

Speaker 1:          00:05:03       One shore nodded in the affirmative. Mccloskey said, no, I think I'll stay here. Latino turned back to Warren and said, we'll go nodding towards shore. Surprised at mccloskey. His response without missing a beat. Warren told the remainder of the SF troops in the room that he'd be right back. He turned to Latino and shore and said, follow me. As he headed out of the briefing room and into the s three operation center, he told the center staff to get a king, beat a fob, four in an hour to transport Latino and short to fob one asap. Next he headed to s one and told the clerk that the newbies were to be processed and cleared to go to food by an hour later, PFC Latino and Spec for shore. We're in a King B heading north to fob one and that right there is an excerpt, the book across the fence which was written by John Stryker Meyer nickname tilt, who is a special forces soldier and saga recon leader in Vietnam and we went deep with tilts on podcast one 81 81 and one 82 and if you haven't listened to those podcasts and stop this one right now and go back and listen to those first.

Speaker 1:          00:06:20       But if you have already listened to those podcasts and you heard a little bit about Doug Latino code name the Frenchman and you know that he was also a special forces soldier at Green Baret and it was also a SOG team member in Vietnam and it is an absolute honor to have not only tilt back again on this podcast, but he brought with him the man himself. Doug Laterno. [inaudible] gentlemen, thank you for coming on. Good to see you again. Good evening sir. Good evening. Thank you for having us. They had great tribute to your, great to have you both here and um, yeah. Let's talk a little bit about how you ended up there. I mean we, you glow, you glaze over in the book. We're, we're riding Rodeo Broncos. We're working in Hollywood, taming and animals. What was your upbringing that got you to, that got you there.

Speaker 3:          00:07:11       Believe it or not, I was born east la in the Barrio.

Speaker 1:          00:07:16       Well that makes sense. Yeah, not, yeah, I know. No.

Speaker 3:          00:07:20       So living in the city. I got fortunate enough when I got into high school, then I got into a program called the future farmers of America. And it gave me a whole different way of looking at life. And I ended up becoming a president of the chapter, but I had several Spanish speaking in Spanish, people in our chapter, one of the largest in all of southern California. As it turned out, well with these people, I could became such good friends and their way of life in still working in the fields of the San Fernando valley, which was still open. Uh, I tended to lean towards the country way of life, even though I was born and raised in the city. And I do nothing about anything at all but city life. But I tried to break away from that through the organization and the western end of the San Fernando Valley. Well, one thing led to another, and I learned about you could go rodeo and there was a place that I could go ride in practice. We could do bull riding and bronc riding and bareback riding and, uh, all the three w [inaudible] San Fernando Valley. This was actually out in thousand oaks at the paramount studios. Okay. Yeah. They had a ranch right there. And, uh, w d coopers is what it was called in those days. And, uh, we could go out on Wednesday night and Saturday and Sunday and ride

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       and have jackpots. And I got into it and then one thing led to another. I got into college and I got on the college inner collegiate team and we traveled and rodeoed. And, and as I went through college, uh, I became adept to it and got into roping with roping horses and own my own rope horse. And it just, the way of life changed from being a city slicker to a, to a cowboy. Where'd you go to college? I started out at Pierce Junior College at the, in Woodland Hills, San Fernando Valley, and then ended up with cal poly San Luis Obispo mustangs. So it through courses there. And, uh, but basically, uh, we just just kept on going. And then with the TV series is we're popular when a lot of animals, there was an opening to be a wild animal trainer at Africa, USA in San Canyon. Newhall. So I jumped up there.

Speaker 4:          00:10:02       How old are you at this point? I'm nine. I'm 20 and while the animal trainers sounds like, you know, you're talking another day in college. There you go. So I jumped up there and before I knew it I was handling Clarence, the cross sided line and Judy the chimp. And then they had a rope horse there that they used and they wanted me to call Dakota Duke and they wanted me to go out and capture all these animals by roping them. And they knew I could rope. There's actual picture of me on the front of the pigging string that was produced out of Lancaster, Antelope Valley of me on the front cover of roping a tiger, often this off of words off this horse. And that's what I did. And I wrote the elephants and I wrote, you know, healed them, healed giraffes. And I headed up White Rhino Forum and that was coming at us.

Speaker 4:          00:10:55       And I turned them back and you know, where they, they would do all these, uh, what they call a veil avail. It'd be open land. It's a, it's an African term. And, uh, we just, uh, would turn these animals loose, but somebody had to go get them. So I, I actually got to work on the, on the TV series that was very popular, called doc tare. And people would see the trucks, they were zebra trucks. I went on Youtube and checked out some doc tare, own footage, classic show really. And uh, but it was shot in like Africa, but actually it was all done right there in New Orleans songs, you know, the compound. And so from there, uh, we ran into a series called the cowboy in Africa and we brought chuck, Chuck Connors in it. And uh, he was the star. And, uh, Hugh O'Brian had actually done the original movie.

Speaker 4:          00:11:51       There's of cowboy in Africa and they shot it in Africa, but here they are going to shoot it here in the United States. And, uh, so I got to work with ostriches and all kinds of different animals that they had to have around the, the compound of the House that he was working out of in the series. But one thing led to another. But as it turned out, uh, one night somebody handed me an old ragged book, it's called the Greenbrae, but Robin Moore and I looked at it and read it and I couldn't put it down. And I said, this has got to be something that this Vietnam War's been going on for quite a while. I grew up almost listening to it every day. There's gotta be something going on that I need to contribute and I think this is what I want to do. I went down the next day, very next day, and signed up. What year was that and how old were you? I was 20 and this was, uh, like a September, just before it was like, well, I say, cause I went in September 1st so it was the day before. So August, you know, August 30th. What year though? 1968. 1960 67 67 years. And I actually entered the service in of September 1st, 1967.

Speaker 5:          00:13:17       Yeah. By that time he had obtained a college degree by tending classes at night. So instead of going through to four year program, the college of three years, well I graduated when I was 17, from high school, from high school. Guy was early into classes at night. Yeah. As spare time. And, and like the, the attitude towards the Vietnam War in 1967, you know, from the, I mean, spread when we think a Hollywood now we, we think of people that just are, you know, just detest everything that has to do with the military most of the time. And you were kind of in that Hollywood scene hanging around with all these people, but that didn't rub off on you at all.

Speaker 4:          00:13:56       It didn't happen that way in 67, 68. It wasn't like that back then. I was shocked when I got back and I actually, uh, visited Bubba in on Peach Street in Atlanta, Georgia. And there was a anti, uh, rally Vietnam rally going down the street. And I looked out the window and I said, Bubba, what in the world is that? He says, those are anti war protesters. I'd never seen it, never heard of it. But in 67, everybody was still pretty patriotic. Got and didn't have that situation.

Speaker 5:          00:14:36       And, and now what about your old man who was, you know, he, he was, you were raised as a son of a guy that was a [inaudible] pilot.

Speaker 4:          00:14:45       Yes. A, a war hero in itself. He was, he ran 13 missions.

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       He was actually the first two missions in were over Berlin. He was on the first two missions that bomb Berlin itself, but he flew 13 missions on his 13th mission. Uh, they gave him a brand new airplane because his airplane had been shot up so bad with his crew that he brought from the United States and flew it over to England that they had to give him a brand new airplane that morning. And he took off and he had 999 planes behind him. He was point that day and he went over a target called Schweinfurth. As it turned out, Schweinfurth in four in 44 had lost 56 airplanes and this day his entire squadron of 22 out of 23 where to be shot down that day. And he was the first one down and they were using new tactics the Nazis were with. They would line up, uh, Mr Smith's and one oh nines and, uh, in a row and go right through them instead of coming around or calling on top, they'd just go right through them.

Speaker 3:          00:16:06       They didn't care if they lost the planes or not. And then they had a folk with one nineties behind them and they took out all these planes in the very lead just to start the battle. But no one could ever figure out why Schweinfurth was so protected and so many losses every time it was tried to be bombed and Garrick during the Nuremberg trials, he admitted that it was the only ball bearing factory the Germans owned without ball-bearings. A war would have been over with in a matter of a few months. And this whole war went on and on and on because neither the British or the u s could figure, figure that out. And they should have bobbed it every day is what he said. And if the war would've been over with, they would have had to surrender. But just the cork in the whole situation.

Speaker 3:          00:16:59       But my dad ended up being my first airborne person in our family in voluntarily in the fall of two. And Halo told themselves one altitude when they find that 10,000 feet when he jumped because his plane caught on fire and they couldn't extinguish it. His engines were on fire and he couldn't open the Bombay doors. The hydraulic system had been shot up. He'd lost his radio operator had a a 20 millimeter right through his stomach and they had to put a parachute on him and just shoving him out the bottom door. And, uh, it was pretty, pretty hectic. The plane blew up in mid air, but those that could got out and made the free fall to the ground and I'll pull their shoots. And, uh, anyway, my dad was attacked by farmers with pitchforks. And thank God that Gestapo and the ss were there to retrieve him and push the farmers back.

Speaker 3:          00:18:02       He thought he was gonna die right there in the hole. He sprained his ankle and he was kind of out of it. And, uh, but anyway, they hauled him off and strung him up and tried to make him talk and you know, the usual serial number, name and rank. And then they put him install log one, which was an all officer camp and had 15,000 officers that had been shot down in that camp. All the enlisted men went to enlisted stall logs and he served 13 months in the POW camp. And then one morning they woke up and the Russians were there, the Russians liberated them. And, uh, he was taken home. And that's the story. And, and uh, he became well known for in our town for what he did. Plus he had two brothers and my uncle Arman was given a silver star by Patton, General Patton himself in France, pinned [inaudible] chest. And my uncle Eddie flew corsairs or so the Latino brothers were quite active. They were. So I had a lot to follow. Jeez. So I ran, I ran 13 missions. How Ironic, right. I ran 13 missions and one bright light.

Speaker 4:          00:19:26       W when your dad came home, what did he do? When did he get out of the army? Did He, well it was the army air corps in those days. It wasn't the air force. And uh, so he, he uh, he tried doing a little bartending and a little this, a little of that, but he had been in construction. He actually partnered up with, is it my grandfather? My, my grandparents and it was Latino and Latino construction company. And uh, he,

Speaker 3:          00:19:54       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:19:54       Filtered back into the construction and started building because they needed homes, every, all of these soldiers coming home. And he built most of the Burbank and Glendale at the time. And uh, they did always did quite well and got into commercial buildings and, and uh, I sort of followed into those footsteps eventually after I got back from the service. So when you, when you enlisted, what did you, how did your dad feel about that? Well, he was not happy about it cause he only gave him a day's notice. I said, I'm going, I'm going into the service and I'm going to go to Vietnam and I'm going to be a green baret. But of course when we and I enlisted, they couldn't give me that. It was the only mos, uh, that they could not give because a, it wasn't guaranteed. They could guarantee me anything else.

Speaker 4:          00:20:46       They wanted to be an officer because I had a degree and I said, no, I'm not going to go to ocs. I want to, I want to go and be whatever it takes to be in special forces. As it turned out in the long run, whether you really want to hear the whole story, it's up to you. But, uh, I did end up being a green baret and going through all the processes and going through all the volunteer and being accepted and going into it and I passed it. But during that time, I'm, you have to realize I'm just an [inaudible]. I went in as an [inaudible]. I'm an [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          00:21:27       I'm the lowest ranking there is. And, and the Mos that I actually graduated with was a prized mos that only a few would maintain and that was heavy weapons. And they go, you can't be heavy weapons unless you're an [inaudible] or above. But when my turn came up to go in front of the panel, my name being an l that's made it documented. That's why I can say this. I was the first [inaudible] ever to be accepted for weapons, Mos training and cause I, I told them exactly what I had in mind. I said, come Monday morning, we've already gone through our phase one and I've gotten my green baret and I said, we need to go into mols and how this Monday I can start. I said, when that Mos has done is so happens phase two of graduation exercise though when you're go out in the field for two weeks in survival mode.

Speaker 4:          00:22:28       I said, it will start immediately the following Monday. And I said, and I can be in Vietnam in the next three months. And they looked at me and said, you got it. So if you look at the orders, everything from l dizzy, there was e e Two e three e four was in my weapons class because I started something that couldn't be turned back. The tide had been turned. So when I got to Vietnam and my first assignment to fob one, I'm now a PFC e three and Pat Watkins who has the DSC distinguished service cross from his uh, time on August 23rd when the fob four was attacked. He told everybody there must be one bad son of a bitch coming up here because he's a PFC. He's 11 Charlie s SF. He said he's been busted down so far. He's gotta be the baddest soldier working on the land.

Speaker 4:          00:23:35       When I showed up and he looked at me, he goes, you are a PFC. Cause I as green as grass and knew nothing. Just been trained on ah, that's a good, that's a good way to kick it off, man. You're welcome. That will be one. Yeah. Yeah. What did you, when you were going through the trip, how long was the, how long was the block of training that you, so you go through bootcamp, how long was the SF training? Was that total? Well, I had to go through bootcamp and that's where I had to volunteer to even be, uh, go through the acceptance of trying to be a, uh, assigned to SF training. Then I went into advanced ait, which is advanced infantry training. You had to go through that and you also had to sign up for airborne training. So you had to go through all, all the basics and come out as an 11 B,

Speaker 3:          00:24:26       which was a small infantry, uh, arms. So anyway, uh, then jumps to, yeah, jump school, but I went through that, the nomination part of taking tests and physical tests and swimming, everything. And then interviews with the SF guys that were there that were in charge of selecting who was going to go. We started out with 350 men volunteering to go through this acceptance. They only took 35 and the end of the deal, I was one of the 35 and I went on to airborne school the next day and went through jump school at Fort Benning, Georgia. They put us after our last jump, which was out of the old boxcar one nineteens and then they came in with the new jets. And, uh, so I, I, I've kind of proud of that. And we went on a bus that night all the way to Fort Bragg and got there in the early morning hours of Saturday, uh, Saturday morning. And then Monday morning we were in formation for our very first day of training in, in special forces. And that, that block, there was two weeks out in survival phase one and then eight weeks of training after that. And then another two weeks of our graduation exercises where we're trained to overtake a government. That's what special forces does, is actually over takeover governments and train gorillas to do so. And uh, so then 30 days later I was in Vietnam

Speaker 4:          00:26:07       was the the, I'm sure the focus must have been like 100% on, hey, you're going to Vietnam. We know you're going to Vietnam. This is what it's going to be like. This is what you're dealing with. When I graduated [inaudible],

Speaker 3:          00:26:18       the colonel stood in front of us, the head of all of trading group and said, I don't want a one of you to volunteer for Fifth Group spent Vietnam. We spent too much money on you. You're just going to go there and die. You stay here. Pick any other group. I'm going to go down the line with the command sergeant major and he's going to tell me what group you want to go to. I had 23 graduates in my class, all but three volunteered for Vietnam. He was not happy.

Speaker 1:          00:26:53       What I'd like you to think like why does, why is someone during the Vietnam War going to join special forces unless they want to go to Vietnam? I mean

Speaker 3:          00:27:01       exactly, but in my mind there was something wrong. It had been going on for years. [inaudible] and special forces had been there before. It was a bit a war advising and I just could not figure that out. And I said, I've got to go. I've got to see why it's taken so long. It's taking longer than the World War II and that was five years. So why is it taking so dang long? So I said I've got to get there and do something about it. That's how I, my attitude was, okay,

Speaker 1:          00:27:36       French prince comedy is going to handle this today. I'll see. Oh, I see. Yeah. Yeah. All right, I'm going to go to the book here. Go. This is, this is going back to across the fence and I'm obviously, I told everyone to buy this cause I've been reading chunks of it. And if you haven't bought it yet, just buy it right now. Um, written by John Stryker Meyer. So this is a section where he's, he's writing about the Frenchmen. So here we go. Within 24 hours. The turnover in store. We're on recon teams at fob one and the immediately began training immediate reaction drills, weapons and explosives training, reviewing team slps, practicing helicopter extractions on strings and practicing wiretaps as October yielded to November. Many of the members of the two recon teams began to build a rapport because they were doing so much training together on the food buy range in addition to a Tourneau insurer.

Speaker 1:          00:28:28       Also quickly learned that the veteran indigenous personnel on their teams were highly skilled and fearless warriors. One night while the turbo was recording a verbal message for his parents on his portable cassette player lap. The young point man on s t Virginia came into his room and spoken to the recorder. I want to tell you, parents have private Latino not to worry about him. We respect him and I'll keep an eye out for him and don't worry if an enemy shoots at him. I'll catch the bullets with my body. I'll protect your son. Thank you for sending him to Vietnam. He's a good soldier

Speaker 3:          00:29:02       that he was, the kid was like 16 years old and he was our point man. Who knows how many kills he had. He was fearless. His parents had been both killed. He was an adoptee in the song. He was raised and lived and fought and saw. Ugh. Wow. And he prided himself on trying to learn how to speak English because he wanted to be number one interpreter. Yeah. How'd your parents like that? Did they ever get the tape? They got the tape. Yeah. I wish I knew where they were that they passed away and we couldn't find him. But uh, yeah, it was amazing. And my dad knew right then and there I wasn't coming home.

Speaker 6:          00:29:55       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:29:55       He knew I wasn't coming home and he didn't, he had to try to keep my mother from figuring that out. But he knew that I would not be let come Paul because of the secret missions. He figured they would, the government would take me out before they would let me come home with what I knew. Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:30:15       And Lap as a kind of Vietnamese southby amuse ally that you never heard about [inaudible] that we worked with every day. And we're alive today. Thanks to them. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:30:23       we are alive to them. Oh yeah, we do. And a couple of [inaudible] pilots. Yeah, it's true distractions. I have 13 string extractions. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:30:38       13 for 13. Yes. Lucky 13. I know, that's what my dad said. He had 13,

Speaker 3:          00:30:47       1300 bombing hours, flight hours, but he also had 13 months in the POW and he was also shot down on Friday the 13th.

Speaker 1:          00:30:56       April 13th. April, April 13th. Uh, no superstition here on lunch. Yes. Alright. Continuing on a few days before thanksgiving. S T Virginia is one zero Childress announced that an operation ordered come down from the s three. The team had a mission in the western section of the DMZ. And then I'm going to fast forward a little bit here to uh, a guy named McGovern quiet spoken McGovern, gave him a rye half smile and said, we can't have that. You need to have a car. 15 for your first mission. Follow me. The duo walked over to McGovern's room. He opened his locker and pulled out a clean car, 15 and handed it til the Tourneau. This is a special car. 15 he said, according to official army records, this car 15 was written off as a combat loss at fob three in case on meaning as far as the army's concerned, this weapon doesn't exist someday after successful tour of duty in Vietnam. If you're so inclined, you can take this baby home with you because it doesn't exist. But as you can see it does and it's a sweet weapon. It never failed me. And I know that since you're a weapons man, you'll take good care of it. Up to this point, Latino would use an m 16 for all of his training. Now with his car, 15 he was ready to take on the world.

Speaker 1:          00:32:17       True. It was a mean weapon. You see it in that picture? Yeah. Yeah. Book has the picture of it. Yeah. The uh,

Speaker 6:          00:32:28       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:32:28       and just Joe's rocking those 20 round mags. I, every time I see those pictures of you guys with those 20 round Mags, I just, I just, we carry, I carry it.

Speaker 3:          00:32:36       The five of them stuffed the canteen covers. We didn't carry food per se. All my food, I had zippers sowed into my sleeves up on my shoulders left and right and I would roll up dry dehydrated rice with electrical tape instead of one full ration. I took one full ration of food and cut it into five different days from maximum output. And we only ate once a day and we just put, uh, we only had four quarts of water cause we didn't want to carry any more weight or any more, anything else. But ammunition, we carried all ammunition grenades, m 79 shells cause we carried sawed-off m 70 nines. And so w that's all we carried was ammunition because when we go in, that's our supply. There's no re supply. It's all up to us. And many a time we came back with nothing and had to resupply ourselves because we got down to the last bullet

Speaker 6:          00:33:45       many times

Speaker 1:          00:33:48       25. What was your low, do you know what your load outweighed?

Speaker 3:          00:33:51       Yes. My web gear with all the clips and everything in it and all the water, all that weighed 75 pounds. My red sack, because I carried the radio, the PRC 25 see for claymores, a blasting caps, all everything that you needed, uh, an extra antenna, all that stuff inside. Was there another 75 pounds? I weighed 135 I carried 150 pounds in the field.

Speaker 1:          00:34:25       Yeah, that's crazy. That's, that's crazy.

Speaker 3:          00:34:30       But that was everybody's load. The Indian [inaudible] are mercenaries. They carried probably 130 pounds and they probably didn't weigh more than 120. 115

Speaker 1:          00:34:41       please. Um,

Speaker 6:          00:34:45       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:34:47       continuing on the opportunity arrived on Thanksgiving Day 1968 after the weather cleared at the quad tri launch site quoting tri, is that right? According to Tree Quang Tree launch site, SD Virginia boarded the king bees and headed west of the target area with three American and four south Vietnamese team members lap the 17 year old hardcore point man who had run many missions hone, is that right? Yes. Home. The Interpreter Cho, the m 79 operator and con cowboy, don't who had fought valiantly besides Lynne m black jr with s t Alabama as the second Sikorsky churned westward, the 135 pounds, but turno went through a mental checklist of everything he was carrying McGovern's car 15 the PRC 25

Speaker 5:          00:35:39       FM radio, an extra battery for it. Assad off m 79 m 79 grenade launcher at 22 caliber high standard pistol with a silencer, ammunition for all weapons, hand-grenades gas, mass smoke grenades, a camera, and five special bags of dehydrated rice. He quickly realized he was carrying more than a hundred pounds of gear.

Speaker 5:          00:36:01       His inner thoughts were jarred when the door gunner test fired his 30 caliber machine gun without announcing his intention to anyone with a within a matter of seconds, the king be cut power and began a tight downward spiral into the LZ were children. The lieutenant hone and lap were already waiting. The dizzying downward spiral ended as the pilot rev the engine and landed on the LZ. Cho exited the age 34 with the Terrano and cowboy following him into the Woodbine connecting with the remaining members of the team. The king be lifted off and the LZ quickly cleared the target area.

Speaker 6:          00:36:34       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:36:34       And then there was absolute silence. So there's your first, your first mission insert right there.

Speaker 3:          00:36:41       My first answer, you talked about having pucker time and I'm not knowing what the heck we're doing, but we just dropped out of the sky nowhere. Uh, and I mean it was adrenaline rush, but you know, I'd been roping tigers and rhinos and I'd be riding bulls and Bronx and you know, it, it just, it just came to me, you know, but it, but it was, I mean I'm here all my training all that time over a year and I'm here. This is it. This is the day. Yeah. Now you question whether you're going to stand up to it cause you know, the enemy's there, we didn't go there for cause it wasn't, we went there because there was a trail that needed to be followed and find out who was running that trail.

Speaker 3:          00:37:38       The, uh, the door gunner test firing. That 30 cow is a good wake up call the library cause you're, I'm sitting in the door and it's right over my head, MCAT and the, and not only that, our king bees were so stripped that they were so light compared to the regular h 34 marine ships they could out fly him in height and we could get up and over any of those mountains in those high ranges and stuff. And, but they dripped oil and they had oil going down your neck all the time. And then when he shot that 30 cal over the top of the hot brass hit me in the neck. I'm going, holy cry buddy. You know, scared the crap out of me. I almost jumped out and I led, uh, back to the [inaudible]. The

Speaker 5:          00:38:27       book, the audio contrast was starting startling as Latino sense is adjusted to the quiet. He scoped out the LZ, which was in a deep valley between jungled covered

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       mountains, gradually sounds of the jungle resurfaced. Birds Chirping, bugs humming. After 10 minutes, Childress signaled the Chernow to radio Covey with the team. Okay. The insertion was successful. No enemy activity evident. Children's move, the team toward the first mountain movement was slowed by tall elephant grass and the only communication between the team members was hand signals. The team moved in 10 minute intervals, stopping every 10 minutes to listen to what was going on around it. After more than an hour, the team finally emerged from the elephant grass as it continued to climb. The first mountain Laterno was on hyper alert. His heart pounding hard whether sitting in alarm rest period or moving up the mountain near the top of the mountain lap pointed out in observation platform that had been cut to the jungle high off the ground. From that platform, anyone could observe the LZ and the valley where the team was inserted as well as the other open areas that could be used for landing helicopters.

Speaker 1:          00:39:33       Had a trail watcher been sitting on the platform. When s t Virginia flew into the LZ. If so, where was he headed and when would the NVA hit the team? Late in the day, the team finally reached the top of the mountain and found a wide well-used trail. Latino's first thought was, how could anyone be out here in the middle of this, in the middle of nowhere in this thick jungle. Regardless, the team set up it's night perimeter far above the trail where it could see anyone moving while remaining camouflage and out of sight. At last light children's made the final Camo check with Covey as the team settled in for its first night in the jungle. It was an uneventful night. Children's did a midnight Camo check with Hillsborough, the night command aircraft that flew high above the Ho Chi Minh trail and the DMZ and checked in with Covey in the early morning after the team ate breakfast and shifts children's directed lap to move parallel to the trail with cowboy as the tail gunner in the line of margin and Latino walking in front of Cowboy, the team moved slowly in less than 10 minute intervals before taking breaks to listen to the surrounding sounds.

Speaker 1:          00:40:38       They did this because moving next to the trail was fraught with inherit

Speaker 3:          00:40:43       risks.

Speaker 1:          00:40:45       So there's your first night out in the jungle.

Speaker 3:          00:40:48       Yeah, relatively mellow. It was, but the mosquitoes were huge and we wore combats around our heads. We actually use those for tourniquets is more as we can pull them down over our ears and face. Got It. And pick those mosquitoes out the next day cause they were like cranes and I mean then you have to realize too, that's the first meal for an entire day with a hundred days, a hundred degree weather and only one quarter water, a sip in the morning, a sip at noon, a little bit for the dehydrated rice at night and a sip this, wash it down with them. There's one court gone for the day. You couldn't allow yourself to drink ever except on those intervals. And you didn't, you didn't, did you guys plan to resupply water? Like did you guys look the maps and see Nancy Rivers or anything? No streams, no nothing. So you planned one cord a day. One a day we figured out is not healthy.

Speaker 3:          00:42:04       I know you're, I know you're a trainer, but that's what we had to allow ourselves because of the weight, you know, a gallon of water, 7.5 it is. So we had to judge our weight versus ammunition and we, that's what we trained ourselves to do. And not only that, we also took pills so that we wouldn't go to the bathroom either because they could smell you on smelling American. That's why we had to eat rice and eat everything they ate. Otherwise they'd smell you, you know, MRIs and, and can't see rations, all that stuff. They could smell that for miles and they had trackers out there and you had to watch for those, which I think you'll get to, but just that water rations what you have. I trained myself for a year to do that. I did that all the time cause we figured we'd be out in the six day, we'd come out in the six days, so we'd have no water on the last day, but we could survive the five days.

Speaker 3:          00:43:07       Do you ever take any heat casualties guys that went down from lack of water? Actually never did. That's amazing. Never did in the desert. We would even at training guys, we'd have guys go down like on a, on a two day operation. I'd have guys go down from lack of water. I've had guys go down and training and you state side, but I've never had any, our guys were, we were, I'm just going to say we were tough when the gender is a little different than the desert too. Yeah, and because you're got shade, you're triple canopy, so you actually are got shade under over the top of you. You're not in open areas. You never go into an open area. You always follow the canopy, but you have to move slowly because it's so darn thick. So it takes time and you have the tail.

Speaker 3:          00:43:55       Gunner's job is to cover the trail. Try to put, if you, everybody walks in everybody's footprint. If you try, that's what you're supposed to do. Everybody has an area to cover. One guy turns to the right and the other guy turns to the left point. Man covers the one 80 in front tail gunner because of the one 80 and back. And we trained like that. We don't turn our backs and look at what the other guy's doing. We only concentrate on our area and keep that area clean unless we have to move in that direction. Then we all turn that way and move it a precision. It's a precision movement that we practice. We train like that every time we were back in camp, we train how to move. That's why our Virginia and Archie, Idaho or survivable teams besides the having the luck of the gods with us, you know,

Speaker 5:          00:44:53       sometimes you gotta make your own luck a little bit through. We, we talk about that all the time. Like we would train all the time. I mean we'd patrol around the compound, rehearse, rehearse, we'd Rehearse, get this. It always shocks. People are just getting in and out of the trucks. Like, you know, we'd have a big, a big a giant truck to transport troops in, but we do raids with those things and we'd practice getting out, you know, like okay. Cause if this takes you seven seconds, if you're in a firefight, I mean Stephan sexist of law a long time to be trying to get out of a truck that people are launching grenades at, you know, and so we'd practice that. We could do it quickly, do it at night, do it in the dark, do it with your gear on, you know, reverse order. Do it again. And that's what we do. So that we'd be, you know, ready for those situations. The same thing, we actually

Speaker 3:          00:45:38       working out of [inaudible] before we had a island called monkey mountain. Uh, and we'd go over there and we set up a course to walk from one side to the other and that's how we would drain so that we, we could continually upgrade how we walked.

Speaker 5:          00:45:58       And you guys didn't, I've talked to tilt about this. You guys didn't bring mosquito nets in the field to wear over your head.

Speaker 3:          00:46:05       Never. That would be what we had was what they call, believe it or not, they had mosquito repellent. That was US army issue. But we also had max factor that did the makeup. Okay. And what's that all about? The grease paint. Camouflage. Paint color paint. Yeah. And what Wade would do is take the repellent and mix it in our palms, scored into our palms and put the grease pain in our palms and then put the paint over our face for it to cover our highlights. So there's no reflections. And besides that I used electrical tape and wrapped up my, my trousers at the bottom around my, my boots. So to keep the leaches out but also that closed off. And then I also did that around the risks of my arms. And then we wore, we, our car fifteens were so hot that we had to wear gloves with a few fingers cut out of them. We looked like Michael Jackson

Speaker 5:          00:47:11       way before his time and wish she had told him about that grease paint idea. I liked that, but you didn't know that. I didn't know. See, I learned something. There you go. A little late. A little late. Thanks. So [inaudible] mosquito repellent and that grease paint mixed together made a very gooey mess, but it would

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       keep them off of your face, you know? And then when you are at night when they were at their worst, you could pull that corvette down and then you know, keep 'em Outta your ears and they would stay off your face because they didn't want anything to do with it. And we always carry just a little extra with us to keep it going, you know, because being out there for five days, you know the most that most, I mean most of the time we get shot out in a day, two days, three days. But I had the luck of having several five and seven day missions. I, I was able to stay out a long time. As our teams progressed further and deeper, they didn't think we'd go that far, but we went deeper than anybody could ever go. We got down to some of our missions and layoffs with one minute on time with the King B.

Speaker 7:          00:48:22       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:48:22       There was no bringing us out. Once they dropped us on the ground, it was over with. They had to go back and get fuel for no 10 minutes station time just to your left and to add to. But they weren't expecting us that far. We could get right into all catch him off guard.

Speaker 7:          00:48:40       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:48:43       all right. Going back to the book as s Virginia moved up the second mountain cowboy and Latino began to hear women's voices off the trail.

Speaker 7:          00:48:52       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:48:52       Cowboy Orange Laterno to go explore the sounds. Letourneau shook his head, no, indicating they had to stay with the team. Cowboy who spoke broken English repeated the suggestion adding it could be a small NVA village. We could kill everyone and make the NVA Boku angry. We want to let them know we can hurt them the same way they attack our camps and villages, but turnover again declined and gave him the hand signal to plant some m 14 anti-personnel mines on the trail behind them in case the NVA soldiers were trailing them. As a team moved on, Latino planted a few more toe poppers and mark their locations on his map for after covering them expertly. He laid down some powdered mustard gas on the ground for any tracker dogs that might follow their trail. The mustard gas was leftover from world war one. How it landed. It flew by, remained a mystery to Latino. The good news was that it still worked. The fact that it was the fact was confirmed during the next break when the team heard a dog howl in anguish after snorting some of the old mustard gassed.

Speaker 1:          00:49:57       Maybe it didn't work that well because a few minutes later the dog was back on the team's trail. Cowboy told the Turno to use his pistol to kill the dog. Latino's mind flashback to special forces training group born instructors had said the same thing, but turnip pulled out. The 22 quietly moved back down the trail, took off as rock rucksack and moved a few more feet before lying down on the ground facing the trail. The dog never realized the Turner was there when the dog was about 10 feet away. Letourneau fired one shot. It struck the dog between the eyes killing him instantly. The canine dropped in his tracks out of Latino's view on aware of what had happened. The dog's handler moved up the trail. He got near the dead dog. When he got near the deck dog, he stepped on a toe popper. Letourneau in cowboy heard the NVA screaming in pain and anguish.

Speaker 1:          00:50:46       They left him behind figuring he would die shortly the team moved further up the mountain with Latino and cowboy providing rear security again, Latino and cowboy heard women's voices below them again. Cowboy urged the turtle to go downhill and attack the encampment and again Latino declined. That's a, that's so these guys are on you obviously at this point when, when you are, you guys are still heading up the mountain because, but, but do you think you can get away from them and what is your point? What is your, what is your, what are you trying to accomplish at this point?

Speaker 3:          00:51:19       At this point we're trying to get away from the tracker but I've managed to take care of the chapter but we don't know how many people are there. We keep hearing the voices of women's voices below us. Cowboy keeps wanting me to go down there with him trying to confuse the whole situation cause he wants to kill him cause he says it'll make them mad. Then they'll come after us and we can really get into it. Well, cowboy just got off a mission on October 5th which is in the book where they decimated a 10,000 man division of all things. Eight and a half hours. They took down 85% of them with an eight man team. Incredible. But it's true and he, they stacked bodies up for sandbags. That's how many they were killing so fast. But he was insistent. But I told him we can't do that because I can't split the team.

Speaker 3:          00:52:15       I have to do it. My one zero says I'm just a one two I'm, I'm low man on the totem pole here, you know, and there's even a lieutenant with us, but he's, he's the one one, he's below. He's actually below my sergeant because there's no rank in song. That was one of the things that always took me aback was there was no rankings and song. We didn't carry rank, we didn't wear rank. It was whoever was there. The longest that lived the longest was the 10 head man. These the ones zero, whoever lived the longest was the one zero. And that's how it went down. And then when that one zero was killed, the one one took over usually took over the team from there on until he was killed. And then the next one, the one two would take over. He would cause he'd stepped up to the one one position and that's how our, we progressed with our teams because everybody was killed one as, as it as we went along. We were just lucky. But I did lose my one zero Gunther Wall and uh, of course children's went home and he was lost to an automobile accident. And so it's just, you know, but that's how well they progressing.

Speaker 5:          00:53:30       And at this point, this is your first mission you got. It's like, um, I'm trying to do everything right. Yeah. And you're getting the full benefit on your first mission. You've got the dog track and you, you've got the, the NVA camp down below. You've got the women's voices, you've got the tracker coming up behind the dog. I mean it's, he's hitting the tow popper. This is like, and we know getting everything, everything you were hoping for. Here it is. Here it is. And we know the is there because the jungle because their families are there. So we know of course we are on, we're thinking too. Maybe they there the tracking,

Speaker 3:          00:54:06       there's families too, you know, because they would hire trackers. They tell the trackers. You either track for us, we'll kill you. And so they have no choices but because they're just indulge out there living, trying to survive.

Speaker 5:          00:54:20       So you're trying to get up the mountain and get away from the track or was it possible to shake the trackers? Was it possible to like actually lose them sometimes? Sometimes. Uh, or did you feel like once the trackers were on you, you were pretty much headed into your extract?

Speaker 3:          00:54:35       Exactly. Exactly. Because they were, they were communicating in some way of fashion and let the NBA know we fought regular Jews. We never shot, fought the Vietcong that the Vic called the VC. We, we, we actually fought uniformed, uh, MVA and uh, the regular army that the north Vietnamese had. But we needed to get off of the keep off the trail and keep going the cause we needed to find out where this trail was going. This was our mission to try to figure out where this trail went. It we did accomplish it in the, in the end because I went on a second mission, which is later in the book and uh, I found actually went into north Vietnam and with inserted on Christmas of 68 in north Vietnam on the same trail but higher up. And that's a whole different story there. But [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          00:55:32       well, going back to this story, here we go. By the time Letourneau completed his last radio call to Covey, the team was involved in darkness and team members began to set up a perimeter for the night. Dawn broke without any enemy activity. When Covey flew over the team in the morning, he warn childrens that a team was being extracted, extracted under heavy fire and another was being inserted into a top priority. Target. Sit tight was the last instruction from Covey. St Virginia didn't move from its quiet spot alongside the mountain during lunch hour. The member, each member ate in shifts and Latino went out to inspect the claim. More minds the team had deployed to ensure the NVA hadn't turned the deadly explosive devices around to face toward them. When he completed his inspection, Latino found a log to sit behind. The NVA would actually do that. They'd crawl up to your perimeter and turn your claim on triple canopy. You don't, you could

Speaker 3:          00:56:26       pass him up within two feet of you. They could be two feet away from me and you wouldn't know it. That's how thick the jungle is and you would see a foot, you know, you think combat, you might see a foot and you shoot the foot as long as you shot the foot, you know, he was down. He wouldn't go to survive. They had no hospitals, you know, see that. You could count that as a, as a kill, but you know, but you can see, you just had to mow down the jungle, open it up. Guess where they're at.

Speaker 5:          00:57:00       The green tracers coming out gave you a clue. Yeah. Yeah. Just shocking to me that they, they would crawl up and try and turn around your claymore mines so that when you attack, when they attacked you, then you clock off your claymores and boom, you're actually claimed warring yourself. Later on.

Speaker 3:          00:57:18       The CIA gave us a piece of equipment that I carried that had a little thread out of a box and you could wrap that whole thread around your, at your encampment or where you were a always is right at the moment and put it in your ear and if that thread was broke, it would sound a buzzing noise in your ear and you knew somebody came through. It could have been an animal, but you knew somebody came through your perimeter and you just had to put it in front of all your claymores and then to stop it, you just lit a match and burnt it. [inaudible] use it the next day, the next time. But once I had that, my by perimeters were always covered after that.

Speaker 5:          00:58:08       Going back to the book later in the afternoon, children's signaled the team to pull in their claim or minds and prepare to move out. Due to the combined weight of his rucksack and web gear. We'll turn him, moved to his knees and slung his rucksack on his back just as it landed on his back. AK 47 his open fire Laterno was slammed to the ground face first. The impact so severe he thought he had broken his nose, startled the Turno, jumped up with his car. 15 pointing toward the AK 47 gunfire that was near the front of the team. Surprised that there was no NVA near him. Latino removed the rucksack to discover that for AK 47 rounds had ripped through the 23 pound PRC 25 he reached into an especially especially tailored pocket on his fatigues shirt, which was sewn with vertical zippers. One on the left side of the shirt and one of the right side between the top and bottom of the pockets of the shirt and pulled out his URC 10 emergency radio and broadcast a general alert for any aircraft in the area. S T Virginia was declaring a prairie fire emergency.

Speaker 6:          00:59:14       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:59:15       So this is like your first fire from the enemy. You could shop the radio for four rounds in the radio. Knock down.

Speaker 4:          00:59:21       Yeah. I didn't know nothing. All I knew in my button nose was busted. I thought it was anyway, and then I'm going and I'm having to think what am I supposed to do? And I was my first reaction. Meanwhile, my one zero children's was mad as hell at me because he says, bring me that damn radio. I said that her tinning could do crap for us. He said, I said, it ain't working. I think it's shot up. And I said, it don't work. There's no signal. And so I brought it to him. Well, needless to say, I was standing up when I brought it to him and he's laying on the ground and he grabs me. He says, can't you just get down? Well, the AK 47 rounds are hitting all over us. We're in the middle of a firefight. Art Work, returning fire me. I'm still standing there in shock and he pulls me to the ground, saves my life, and he says, he looks at the radio real quick and he goes, the intent has been shot off.

Speaker 4:          01:00:19       That was the fifth round that went through a breach between my red sac and my web gear and pulled out my spare antenna and screwed it on. And we had Camo, maybe it was good to go air condition and we just then, uh, Pat Watkins is flying over our copywriter and he called, we, he assessed what was going on. He could see it from where his location was in the air and he could see, he could see we were taking massive amounts of fire and he called for an extraction from Kong tree and they, they brought the king bees in to get us and we had to, you know,

Speaker 5:          01:01:02       yeah, yeah. The, the uh, once he got that, once he got, once he got the radio back from you and it started working children's screams into the radio, we need an x fill now and declaring prairie fire emergency. Is anyone out there? We did a second or two. There was a response. Calm down Childress, I realize you're under fire. Set a Kovi rider. Just at that moment, several AK 47 is opened up from the woodline near the log where Latino had been unceremoniously slammed onto his face, lap and cowboy. He returned fire. Covey continued. We heard your team declare a prairie fire emergency on the guard frequency and I've rallied the cavalry. What's your mark? Do you have an LLC in site? Before children's said a word of the radio, he turned to Latino and said, see, it works. Supposedly we'd left it for the NVA.

Speaker 5:          01:01:46       Never. I say never ever leave a radio behind. As if to emphasize that point, the NVA open fire again as a lab took as that began looking for an LZ wall, moving the team down the hill, away from the most concentrated NVA gunfire, cutting lectern, no slack. Children's roared. Tell Covey. We'll give them a fixed in five minutes. We'll probably need strings to get outta here. I doubt we can make it into the valley where Kim B King B can pick us up without missing a beat. Latino who for the first time felt for burning stings in his back, repeated those words to Covey while he and cowboy providing cover fire as the tail element of the team. Then Latino nodded a cowboy who ignited several claymore minds that the team had set out on this perimeter. Those mines only slowed the NVA for a few seconds before the dust and debris from the blast settled. The NVA soldiers were moving through it toward cowboy and Latino without saying a word. The two men took turns firing at the enemy while moving down the hill, rotating around each other. Cowboy would fire several bursts from his car. 15 and then reload. As you reloaded Latina would open fire providing cover covering fire for the team. The classic covering moves scenario?

Speaker 3:          01:02:57       Yes. Just the way we drill it. That's right. Oh yeah, and it just came natural. Believe it or not, it just came natural. What part of it just came natural? Just load and fire and fire and move. Load and fire move load and fire and it just, we, we had to get in the team came together, our firepower. You can only imagine what a full team of firepower with all car fifteens and m 70 nines and Claymore mines going off. They knew they had a battle but they'd were overpowering us. Yeah and it's,

Speaker 5:          01:03:36       I talked about this with tilt as well, like the determination of of them where you think of the insurgence, insurgent army, you know their rule is like, hey we don't, we don't need to fight. We don't need to win this firefight. We don't need to win this battle because we're going to be here for a long time. We can wait. We will fight when we want to fight and it's the way that they attacked you guys and lot took so many losses but continued to press and continue to press like their, their fighting spirit.

Speaker 3:          01:04:01       Hi. Well let me give you a backdrop on that. Maybe tilt hasn't even got to that. After the war is over with and history starts evolving in the books and people start asking questions. We find out that they've got 40,000 troops hunting this down, hunting saugers down and there's a huge bounty on us. We heard hundred thousand $200,000 to kill an American on a song team and had a kill an American award. If they kill somebody. They got the award and the bonus and their instant heroes and who neu forever. It meant everything to them to kill us and they I, they put 40,000 troops designated that we had tied up because they wanted to kill us cause we did so much damage to them. Go ahead.

Speaker 5:          01:05:01       Speaking of damage, during one short Lall cowboy, again, plan to claim or mine in the direction of the advancing NVA and Latino dugout, another claim or from his rucksack and placed a ten second delay fuse in it. When the NVA, again, advanced cowboy ignited his Clayborne mind claim more. When the NBA moved again toward the team. Latino ignited his fuse and ran down the hill with cowboy to catch up to their team before they reached the team to be 40 anti-personnel rockets slammed into the trees above them, showering them with shrapnel. A few more exploded as Latino and cowboy moved down the hill the ten second then the ten second fuse ignited in another claim war. It brought it bought precious time for the gun and run team of Latino and cowboy to cover ground and catch up with the remainder of St Virginia. Would you guys drill pulling out those claymores were the ten second fuse and hooking them up and setting them up. I mean, you know, it takes like a little bit of time to do that. Did you guys have them pre rigged where you could just stick them in the ground? How did you guys do that?

Speaker 8:          01:06:02       We did. We had him pre-reqs. Everybody says, well, you can't have your blasting caps with you. You're just, they hit the black sketch is going to blow you to smithereens. Yeah. But those precious seconds would be, and I had mine in my red Sag Pre-req. There you go. Yeah. With us with Bubba had his precut so we had to five seconds, 10 seconds, and in longer than you had the actual cracker itself with the full standard court that you could blow, that would give you more distance. How long was that course? 50 feet. 50 feet. So you could put the claymore down on a tree and pulled back and then you hit it handheld. Or as we did that one mission, we were using the five seconds that bubba put in, but they were pre cut and we had them ready to go. So he just put the fuse in and pull it and then stick it in the ground. You're the little steaks, the standard Gregg jam it in the ground and you're good. Yeah. So you're setting those things up in like 10 seconds. So she always had to make sure they were pointed the right way. Yes, indeed. Point towards the enemy, towards the enemy. Read the back.

Speaker 5:          01:07:08       Uh, continue on as Childers called an airstrikes Latino reflected on house. Surreal. This firefight had been. It wasn't like anything he'd witnessed on television or oriented in any movie. Instead of men charging each other and killing each other in plain sight. Here in triple canopy jungle, he observed green tracers from AK 47 his first or at the most an enemy hand or foot, and somehow the NVA found firing lanes where they could launch shoulder held B 40 anti-personnel rockets that slammed above and around them as they raced down the hill for their lives. Again, the [inaudible], the voices of the special forces instructors echoed in his mind. They had told the young aspiring Green Berets at Fort Bragg that the NBA was a tough, resilient opponent. Many had fought against the Japanese during World War II and against the French driving them from Vietnam. In 1954 after the battle of den BN Pew in North Vietnam, the sounds of king bees in the distance and the crashing funder of beef 40 rocket slamming into trees above his head, shook Latino out of his moment of introspection and turned his own divided attention to a crescendo of AK 47 fire from the enemy.

Speaker 5:          01:08:14       S T responded with

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       volley after volley of full and semiautomatic gunfire while the Toronto and Cho fired several m 79 rounds toward the densest section of the jungle where the AK 47 gunfire was emanating.

Speaker 6:          01:08:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:08:30       Through the gunfire, someone popped a smoke grenade, which brought the king bees closer to our t Virginia's location in the jungle over the din of gunfire, children's and cowboy told everyone to put their Swiss seats on and prepare for an extraction. In short order, a King Bee was hovering over St Virginia more than 125 feet above the jungle floor. Latino Cowboy Cho and honed hook hook their d-rings into the old McGuire rig that hung from the end of the ropes. And shortly

Speaker 1:          01:08:57       we're being lifted out of the jungle. As the quartet of recon men was being lifted into the air, the envy on the NVA unleashed another salvo of AK 47 gunfire and several [inaudible] rockets. Shrapnel from the rockets hit them with varying degrees of size and velocity. All of them were wounded. It was during those explosions that Latino realized his car 15 and somehow been caught in a rope above him just far enough away that he couldn't reach it. He pulled out his m 79 and launched a 40 millimeter grenade toward the NVA positions. Now all he could see for of the enemy were hundreds of muzzle blast from AK 40 sevens in green tracers, re green trace arounds, eerily climbing toward the quartet of s t Virginia men before he could reload his m 79 the king B began to move away from the target area, surprising him because the men had not yet cleared the jungle.

Speaker 1:          01:09:49       Instead of continuing to climb out of the target, moving straight up until the men cleared the jungles. Triple canopy of trees and vegetation. The King Bee was moving away from the target area due to heavy enemy ground fire. In recent months at least two king bees were shot down during string extractions from hot targets, but these facts were unknown to Latino at the time. Shrapnel from the beef 40 rockets split exploded around Estee Virginia men stinging them with bits of hot metal. Further spooking, the King B crew Latino began to violently collide with tall jungle trees, feeling like a metal ball in a pinball machine. Latino Karun off several more trees as at least one more be 40 exploded in the tree tops again, showering him with trapped [inaudible]. A tree branch hit Laterno from the side and turned them upside down in his in his rope Swiss seat as the rope began to slip down from his hips, Latino remembered spider telling him how a one zero from another team had recently been shot out of his Swiss seat during a rope extraction. Another tree struck Laterno before he was able to muster a surge of strength and momentum to reach up and grab the rope above him as, as his body finally cleared the tree top. The only thing between him and certain death blow on the jungle floor 200 feet down was the single piece of rope tied into the King B. Jeez.

Speaker 5:          01:11:14       Just another day in sock, just another day in saga. And I had 13 of those like that.

Speaker 7:          01:11:19       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:11:23       How did you guys, uh, when you, when you're getting hit with all that and you're shooting back hanging from a string, I mean, that's just like completely insane that, that no one died on that, on that rope, on that extraction.

Speaker 3:          01:11:38       And you're also spinning.

Speaker 5:          01:11:41       Well, just the rotation that one comp, we get knocked around the strings

Speaker 3:          01:11:45       Benning and the air is flowing past you and you're having, you know, you're, you're just trying everything you do to stick with it. But that was my first mission. Uh, later on I've finally realized that I didn't have a extra d ring on my web gear, the strap in. That's why I was falling over backwards. I did that twice. Then I finally found out from my good buddy here, tilt that I was doing it wrong, but because after my second mission, uh, children's had left, but he had not given me that information out of all of our training, had not thought about it. He was extracted on another jobber. So he didn't see that happen.

Speaker 5:          01:12:39       It's just, it's, it's unbelievable. When I, when I read these things, I just can't, it's just hard to even fathom the, the mayhem when you're talking about just all these B 40 rockets, which is basically like an RPG, an older RPG, um,

Speaker 7:          01:12:55       [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          01:12:57       It's crazy.

Speaker 5:          01:12:59       Going back to the book with one final urgent Pola. Turner was able to move himself upright in the Swiss seat as the king bee continued to climb higher into the sky, distance could distancing itself from the fear of exploding be 40 and AK 47 gunfire while gaining airspeed as the king bee ascended the heavily sweating Latino Clung to the rope as another sensation overwhelmed his body chattering teeth. Within a matter of minutes that King Bee had climbed to an altitude of more than 5,000 feet where the air is thinner and much, much colder than on the jungle floor. So much colder. That Latino's body began shaking violently from the dipping temperatures as the king bee continued to climb into the safety of higher altitude in ordinary circumstances, few people would ever think about freezing to death over Southeast Asia, but for the men and CNC was just another hurdle they had to clear as the king be headed east, we'll turn to look down on the spots in the jungle that appeared to be good.

Speaker 5:          01:13:52       LZs thinking, why don't you lay him there? But St Virginia's collective agony continued until the king bees finally landed in south Vietnam. By that time, every member of SD, F, s, t, Virginia had their circulation cut off to their legs. They couldn't stand or walk. All they could do is unhook from their Swiss seat, grabbed their stuff and try and get the circulation going again in their legs while the door gunner helped them to get back to the king bee. When the team returned to Quang Tri Quang tree clung tree launch site before heading south to food by children's, pulled the Tourneau aside and told him, take good care of that radio. You're going to take it on the next mission, whether you like it or not. Where's he gonna make you bring the shot up radio? Yeah, he did. We did. It saved his life tilts life in the end. How's that? That Christmas Day, Michigan. Okay. We had the Intel report. Was that the same radio you brought a shot up radio in the field.

Speaker 5:          01:14:50       I got a hundred miles to get out of it. Oh, that's ridiculous. As darkness fell. The King B's lifted off from crying tree for free by when the old war boards landed on fob one landing zone. St Virginia was greeted by one man, former s t, Virginia, one zero John McGovern. He greeted each of the team members as they eggs exited the king bees asking each one, are you okay? After the King B's departed bathing them in sand, dust and LZ debris kicked up by the pro prop. Wash McGovern asked children, did you hear about Baiter? A tall children shook his head, no. What happened November 13th we lost a King Bee with seven SF troops on it. We lost the entire King Bee crew. They were a bunch of straphangers who volunteered to pill pulling the elder son mission on the trail, but an anti aircraft round hit the king be en route to the target.

Speaker 5:          01:15:48       It exploded in mid air. They never had a chance in silence. McGovern drove the tired, dirty and hungry team back to the team room. As the Vietnamese team members climbed off, the truck, McGovern turned to Latino and said, you know what was really scary about that mission? The day before they got shot down. Me, Lynn Black, Rick Howard, John Peters, Tim Shaf, and a few others had volunteered and we're actually on the king bees suited up, ready to go. Only to, we canceled last minute by bad whiskey X-ray, which is weather in the AOE that was too close for comfort. After a long pars pause Latino, he asked the Turno, how did it go out there? I heard you were good on the radio. You didn't get rattled. You ain't a cheery no more. You've joined a small, Unique Club of SF men, C and c recon men who went across the fence.

Speaker 5:          01:16:39       It was nothing like I ever could have imagined to. The terminal responded looking toward the Vietnamese team members. He added, let me get some chow for the indigent. You will write about them. They have ice in their veins. I'm beat. I'll see you in the morning. Latino walked through the white sand to the mess hall, picked up some fresh sandwiches and cold sodas for the team. After lingering with the Vietnamese team members, Latino return to his room. Finally taking off his rucksack and web gear as he started to address Latino, became aware of pain in his back

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       where from where the four AK 47 rounds had slammed him face first into the ground. First he peeled off as jungle fatigued shirt and was amazed to find four bullet holes in it. Then he took off his undershirt. Ditto. Four bullet holes were in. It lets her know, picked up his rucksack. Four bullet holes were in it, both in the front and the back, something he hadn't realized during the firefight. Then he looked in the mirror and solve for large welts and broken skin up his spine where the AK 47 rounds had hit his body after punching through his rucksack and the PRC 25 only then did a Latino begin to crump. Comprehend just how lucky you had been. Hours earlier in the day when the NVA shot him in the back four times, the turnover began to cut away the metal, the black electrical tape around his socks, which he pulled up over his pant legs.

Speaker 1:          01:18:01       To keep out leeches and bugs. Then he made a startling discovery when he pulled his pant leg from the sock and pulled off his right boot for AK. 47 bullets fell on the ground in the heat of the battle. The freshman didn't realize that after you was shot in the back, the four 7.62 millimeter NVA rounds had fallen through his pants and his socks into his right boot. He stood in utter amazement staring at the four rounds on the floor before picking them up and throwing them in the sand outside his room, exhausted Latino, walked over to the shower room. The water stung the wounds in his back. Amazingly, the four bullets had enough energy to penetrate his skin, wounding him, but not enough to get under his skin. Too tired to treat the four bullet wounds in his back and trapping the wounds in his arm. Laterno finished his shower

Speaker 7:          01:18:55       and went to bed

Speaker 1:          01:19:00       so that

Speaker 3:          01:19:03       that was mission number one. There's a saying that we came to realize later on, everybody just look at you and say, well, that's just another day in saga. My first mission, I had to run 12 more before it was done.

Speaker 1:          01:19:25       And when you got done with it, I mean will you, will you talking to the other guys? And they were telling you, hey, yeah, that's, that's how it is.

Speaker 3:          01:19:31       Yes. That's how it is. So he couldn't go in the, into the bar and go there and this is what I did. Did you say? Yeah, I got back. Well, and don't forget the footnote on that cause like about what, four or five days later? The medics? Yeah. Tell him about the wounds from the shrapnel. Of course I had to ignore everything because otherwise they'd all think I was, you know, just a looper, you know, so I just had to suck it up, not saying nothing and, but all of a sudden I started getting these boils on me. They were huge. So I went to the medic and, and uh, what's his name?

Speaker 4:          01:20:17       Majia NGO. Mazzeo says, well, he says you got shrapnel in your buddy. That's all. That's all swollen. It's infecting you. He says, you're going to have that for quite a while until we can get every piece out of here. He says, I don't know how many holes you got, but this one here needs attention right now. And it's huge. And there was a, my arm, my arm, forearm actually. And uh, he looked at the other medic shipping and said, hold him down. And he looked at me and said, don't you look at what I'm doing? Don't you turn your head? He said, cause otherwise you're gonna pass out on me when you see what I'm gonna do. He said, so don't you look and shipping you hold him, hold him down and don't work or they're going to pass out. Well what he was doing was taking a big stick swab in hydrogen peroxide and burning a hole right through the, the boil.

Speaker 4:          01:21:10       And then he took forceps and he pulled the strings out with the shrapnel on the end from the beef 40 rockets. Cause they're all made. And you know, in China, their Chai coms, you know, and so they had a lot of string. That's how they wrapped them. They didn't mold them in the metal like we did. And so anyway, I kept having to go and then another day I had to go in, he had to do the back of my head and I had a couple in my head and then I had a couple of my back and another under my arm and I walked around with bandages until I went out on my next mission. The witness one of those getting pulled out and it was gross. What were you doing? Just wanted to, you know, Spec to spectate. He had pulled several out.

Speaker 4:          01:21:51       We kept hearing about these things. Let me show you. Oh thanks. They're talking about TMI. Talk about Puss, pimple breaker. But Hey, where you're going to go back into the field anyways. Yeah. It was like, Hey, it doesn't matter if it, we'll do it. We'll do what we can right now. But exactly. Exact field. Yeah, exactly. Cause we had another mission lined out for Christmas of 68 so what was the optempo like meeting? How often would you, when you did, you did your 13 missions, how long did that take? What, what time span was that over whatever one year tour. One year tour. I had 13 missions and one bright. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:22:27       like, and I, some day we'll talk about the bright light, I guess. Why not today? But then if you, you know, it's a, it's a, uh, it's not written in the books because of what it ended up being. But a bright light in SOG is a volunteer situation where a team of volunteer to go in and get another team out. This kid can't get out. And we had a lot of those. Or to try to find a team that disappeared. We had a lot of teams disappear. I R t Idaho lane and Owen's completely disappeared. They've never been found to this day. No trace, just completely off the bat. People have gone into this day and hunt the government hunts today and can't find them under good circumstances. Are these the guys that you took over for? Yes. Yeah. And uh, so when I got on the Idahoans transferred from Virginia to Idaho cause tilt went home and I became Lynn blacks one-on-one.

Speaker 3:          01:23:31       Uh, one day he had been gone for a while up at headquarters and I, I always protected him cause I'm the one, one I I protected my one zeros. I had to know where they were doing all the time cause you just never knew cause we had, we had nuns, we had Cambodia, we had mountain yards, we had Vietnamese in our camp. They all fought amongst themselves, let alone wondering if they're the enemy. And we also had an entire team of NVA Choo Hoy's too. Always been, they gave up and that was team Cobra and they were there for a very special mission that they went on and to get us prisoners out of a camp that was located. But we got a call, Lynn went up to the headquarters and had been a little while. So I went up there to see what was going on.

Speaker 3:          01:24:24       He's walking back down and says can we go on a bright light? I said we're ready. We're packed. Cause that's just what you did. If you were asked, you went, he said we got two pilots down and we in there, we think they're alive. We got to go in. They brought a jolly green giant in for us, which is very unusual air force. I don't know where they really took us at this point in time in my life. I, we still don't know. They have all kinds of records, but it's very confusing of where we went. We came in and that jolly when we circled over the top of the plane, it was all intact. It was just sitting there in elephant grass. No one could figure out why. So they brought us down and I jumped out. But when I jumped out, there was a slight lift in the plane and in the jolly green.

Speaker 3:          01:25:30       Uh, and it just came down back down on me about crushed me. And then it came back up and then Lynn jumped out and mar guys jumped out and each I knew and it was an oh two was a push pull Sesno engine in the front and engine in the back. That's where it had been shot down. Yeah. We think it was shot down. We don't, or crashed town [inaudible] however, we just don't know how it happened. But what the real deal was is the plane, whatever happened to it, was making an emergency landing and he saw this opening like an LLC and thought this would be a good place to at least start the landing. Even if it went into the jungle, it would slow it down. Problem was, as soon as they hit the ground, there was a bowl and they hit the front of the bowl with the front engine and stopped dead like a bird track.

Speaker 3:          01:26:21       It was a bird. Yeah. And uh, it stopped it dead, but it bent the engine around to the right. And the man in the right seat was sucked up into the carburetors, into the lie comb engine. And, uh, he was in the fins and he just had his head in his arms sticking out. Said when I got there on that side, it said 10 minutes after 10 in the morning is Rolex watch was cracked, the Bezel was cracked, and it stopped the watch at 10 after 10. And we didn't get there until about two 30. Well, don't forget when the chopper's going down. You're under fire. Yeah. And it's, we're, we're getting some small arms fire. And Lynn goes to the pilot side on the, on the left side and he looked fine, but we realize that yolk had crushed his chest and killed him in place. But it also had him trapped and we couldn't get either one out. But at that point in time that was a trap they'd set. The jolly green had backed off and we started taking tremendous amount of of fire. And I looked across the inside of the cabinet. Lynn Lynn looked back at me and I said, I love you brother. We're not getting out of this. And he, he said, no, we're not. This is it finally got us.

Speaker 3:          01:27:47       And I looked up and radio the Johnny Green to come back in and he shook his head. I could see him plain as day. He shook his head, I don't think I can come back. I said, you better cause I got an m 79 pointed at you. I'll take you down with us. He moved up forward. By that time, there was 200 NBA surrounding us, given it everything they got. And we managed to crawl into that chopper cause if we got up on the wings and he scooped us up and I had already called in tech here cause they already had tech care ready. And as we lifted off and got up about 50 feet and they, one sped flew right underneath us between the plane and in the chopper and I, he looked up at me like this was smiling and he dropped a WP right on top of him and there was crispy critters running everywhere. And we got out of there and got back and we walked down, landed us back at fob four and we walked down the road back to our hooch and we just looked at each other and said another day and saw

Speaker 8:          01:29:10       time. They're on the ground, they, they're under fire going in. They put a perimeter around the aircraft while Lynn and Doug went in to try to establish what the status of the pilots war. And the firefight was intense because I remember when I got back, Doug had just left and I came back to Nava at the end of October 69 so that bright light was fresh on Lynn's mind and we talked about it and I talked to hep later about that Riley and her going, this was crazy cause hap Saudi went in with four and ditch from a RTI to own that team. And Lynn was like, man, I don't even know how we got out of there. So it was one of those real, another just a really tight one. But like Doug says, in a way when you now in retrospect like had just another day in SOG, but that wouldn't really stuck.

Speaker 3:          01:30:03       Yeah, I just thought that out of all my missions and if you read the book and where tilt honors me with a few missions in his books between across the fence and on the ground, that when there was is as tense as it got and we thought it was over physically and mentally we gave up. We thought it was over that we just weren't going to get up out of that mess and get into that shopper than be 40 rockets were hitting that plate underneath that jolly green. We were going up in the air faster than the chopper could get us up in the air from the pounding. We were taken that hadn't been for that span. We might not have to this day, we can't find this bad pilot. We'd have reunions we go to as bad reunions, but we still haven't been able to find that sped pilot that did that.

Speaker 8:          01:30:53       Cause what he's saying is like when the John Green's pulling out the, before he pounded underneath and the armor plating, he could sustain it and it w but it would give the chopper Joel like Lynn Black Hat on October 5th and this is what they're experiencing

Speaker 3:          01:31:07       one October a year later saying, yeah, yeah, exactly. Yup. I'm surprised that they take those B 40 strikes like that. I mean one lucky shot that hits the tail rotor or something and it's just game over. Sure. You know when we get back on missions, we'd walk around our King Bees and count how many bullet holes and how many were in the blades. We did, there's clean shots through the blades and then we, we'd caught 40 50 80 rounds in king bees when we come back. And pieces of metal gone that they had to put tin over. They use beer cans. Yeah. Aluminum beer cans. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:31:50       And what about the, um, what about that operation where you, we had to go and get the 55 gallon drum of [inaudible] and pull that one. Yeah. Okay. We'll go through that. Somebody would probably like to read it in the book, but we'll kind of go through that. We were trained, we had a CIA agent come in and trainers for a brand new explosive detonator. That was a time device that was shaped on the top end of the Bung of a 55 gallon drum as curls. You put a wrench on it and unscrew it. You've seen them. And we said,

Speaker 5:          01:32:34       this is, by the way, this is a seal type missing. So you really appreciate this more. Absolutely. Yeah. When I read about it, I was like, man, this is a good seal mission. Yeah. But, oh well. Well they didn't want to see that.

Speaker 3:          01:32:46       Let's do that in those days,

Speaker 5:          01:32:49       Huh? No, they're busy on the coast. Yeah. They're busy on the coast. They really were. We under this, I mean, everything up to that isn't a jungle, obviously you get to the river boat.

Speaker 3:          01:32:58       Exactly. But we actually went into secret, uh, lock up, uh, couldn't talk to anybody. Nobody could come in and talk to us. And we went through these exercises and training. We actually, uh, loaded up for it and they took us out to the, and took us to a Kang tree and we launched out of there and uh, went into layoffs into this huge river that they had, but we had to stay away from it. We had to actually hike in for two days to get to it. And when we got there and down the hill and to the river, it was night on the second end of the second day. And then Gunther was my one zero and I was as one one. There was no one, one, two and uh, he was an ex marine and he was an east six. And uh, he was my one Siro he'd been around a while and uh, he says, okay, go in and get that drum.

Speaker 3:          01:34:06       And I says, well, you're the marine, you're navy. Why should I go it? Cause you're the one, you're the, you're the one one the European IFC and I'm an six. So that's how it's going down. And don't forget before you get there, they hiked through jungle for two days and two nights right to meet the CIA. I forgot that. Who gave them the specialized chart where he come from? He had Chinese with him and he said, I will meet you out there to give you this device because I can't trust anybody to have this device in case you're caught between now and then. And I said, there's no way we're going to find you out there. This is impossible. He says, don't you worry about it, you get to this coordinate and I will, I will

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       find you. That's impressive. And he did. We got that coordinate and we waited and we waited and next thing we know he come right out of the jungle and there he was. We were going to kill him. We thought was NBA. Yeah, of course. Chinese with Zola. Nautilus was his name, if you pronounce it right, I probably do. I can't pronounce it right, and spelling. It was, he actually was a renegade CIA agent. He was a desk jockey that wanted to prove that he could be an infield agent. As the story finally went that we didn't learn about this until what about 12 years ago and we asked did you meet him later? No, no, no, no, no one knows where he went or what happened to him. We met another CIA we needed, that was actually a counterpart to a Russian KGB agent that when they di rush a deep, finally admitted and declassified the Vietnam War and admitted they had 3000 Russians helping the, the NBA, and they had a reunion and they did an actual video of the reunion, admitting that they had worked with the NVA and the Chinese and helping the, the NVA go up and down the Holcim in trail.

Speaker 4:          01:36:26       Well, this Zola NAACOS had figured this out and got ahold of this device. And how we learned about it was this CIA agent had gone there and help declassify all the records of special ops stuff that was, they were, they had located. And the hole here, they found my name in the KGB at files in Moscow twice. My code name and my real name and the missions that I ran. They did that twice. And they found Lynn because we bumped into, uh, what we, I thought was a Mexican Spanish speaking person, speaking broken English. And I'm from California, right. And I go back to my old days and I told Lynn, I said this, this guy's a Mexican gotta be, what the Hell is he doing out here? And he's talking to us on the radio, he's got our frequency. And Glen says, give me that football on it. So he goes back and forth with him and he says, you got to move out of the area. And he says, I'm not going to move out of the area. I'm here to stay. Here's my coordinates. He'd given a five digit coordinate. No, what are you going to do? He says, well, nothing, but you need to move out. He was trying to save our butts cause he, he was from Angola, was a Cuban,

Speaker 3:          01:37:57       stationed in Angola and had been shifted, loyal Laos and then turned around and he hated the Vietnamese so much. He was trying to help us, but we could see him on the other side of the river that where we were at on this particular mission. And so that mission was in the KGB files that we had spoke to him and he had our, and they knew it was RTI Edo and that we knew it was linen me. And so they are they at as much, cause we had spies in Saigon giving all this information out to, he had a spy that, that uh, they finally caught an American, it was giving all this information now, but for two missions, I'm in the KGB files. So on this oil drum mission, we get down there after we've been given the device and night and I go in and I grab a hold of a drum and of course they have those little lips on there.

Speaker 3:          01:38:52       I can pull that drum it in there full about three quarters because they gotta be buoyant. And I bring that fueled drum right to the side and I'm holding it there. And Gunther unscrews it, the bung off and puts the new one in, screws it up tight. Now I've got to get that drum back out into the flow while the flow is NBA walking it down with bamboo poles, pushing them around. So I get it out there, but I can't get back because here they come. So I had to go under and hold my breath, but I can't hold my breath that long. And this water is ice cold. Right. But fortunately I was a great swimmer in my youth and I, I could, I could handle this, but I could get my nose just above the surface blowout and take a breath and go back under.

Speaker 3:          01:39:50       But cause it's dark and they went on by me finally. But I thought for sure they'd stick me with the one of the Poles. But they pushed that drum on down in the few drums that were around me. And I came back to the edge and crawled out. But I was so cold, I could hardly move. I'm soaking wet of course. And Guthrie says, come on, we got to go. And I finally put my gear back on my rucksack and the radio and my web gear and everything else back on and up the hill. We go, but I'm still just barely making it, just barely making it. I'm so stiff. And uh, we crawled out of there. Took two days to get out. But that device was set for two days, but they hadn't gone off yet. But we finally got extraction orders in and they came and got us and strung us out.

Speaker 3:          01:40:41       And when we were on strings, it went off. The cubby rider was there and it was like an atom bomb. It was a miniature mushroom. And the shockwave, even though we were miles away, came through us on strings and the choppers and just like this and we're, we're going like this back and forth and, and the chopper and the, and the Covey plane is shaking like this. And I mean it was like an atomic bomb just went through us. What you picture when you see, and then then everything became calm and, uh, mission completed. That's a good one. That's a real good, that's a good. So they never knew, never knew. Well, they didn't know until the Russians knew. Yeah. But other than that, they never knew who w and we weren't allowed to talk or tell anybody in camp when we got back, they just, what were you doing?

Speaker 3:          01:41:37       Oh, just another day in song. And that was what we said, because we weren't even allowed to tell anybody what we did because of the CIA mission that we ran. But we, everybody had certain things that they did like that, but it was the first time it had ever been accomplished. What did you notice about the one zeros that you had from a leadership perspective that you remember as like, yeah, this is, this is the quality, some of the qualities that they had from a leadership perspective that you would follow them. Uh, I was most fortunate. I think I had great ones. Zeros, some of them not as great as others. But, uh, when you, my first one, he was my idol because my first two missions and, uh, thanksgiving of of 68 and Christmas a 68. And you can't ever forget those, you know?

Speaker 3:          01:42:40       And uh, so fact, the mission of 68 is where I got the skip from the bloat up radio that let him know he was walking into an edge letting tilt know that he was walking into an ambush. And I'm laying on a trail with the radio on and heard this. My interpreter comes up and interprets what's going on. I managed to get ahold of spider parks. He just had me going by for a radio check and I told him what was going on. He radios to the tilt to turn around and go back that he had intel and tilts going. What?

Speaker 8:          01:43:20       Yeah, it was the first time I've ever had like a direct Intel report. Do not go through the northeast. This is the Christmas Day mission. We were on top of that knoll and Lynn and I had talked about, that was the one quiet area of probably there's a problem, but we were talking that spider goes do not go through the northeast. We have an Intel report. Do not go there. I'm the only Intel report that never happened before or after on a live mission. We're on the ground and we didn't know what the hell it was, but they were right. We did and you noticed or we could extract as it were back in base. A few days later, him and bubba connect and it's going like, yeah, what were you on the ground at Christmas? And then we found out is that, uh, he had that Intel report that was confirmed the one place we could have gone. We shouldn't have, our instincts were right, but we had a confirmation from the Intel report and it was just amazing. You know, he says to this day,

Speaker 3:          01:44:17       they got out of it and due to other factors they got out of it, but just that it saved the team was walking into an l shape, ambushed, and they've been slaughtered. And they were, they were pushing them that way with trackers, gunfire and everything else. And, uh, so they just, just like you say, the gods were always with us sometimes. But, uh, at that very next day, I'm still on the trail where we were signed. That was the trail for my very first mission. We got into north Vietnam, into it. We called nickel steel. And I'd been laying there for four days through this process. And Gunther was a, I mean, children's was, uh, my one zero and we were taking turns and uh, it had been defoliated with Agent Orange and so we had a pretty good view and all of a sudden I saw six pointman coming up.

Speaker 3:          01:45:17       MBA. I'm up there at the trail behind the log. They're down below. I give them the signal, I give them the signal, I got six and I can see him and children's right away, he knows what's going on. So he's preparing the team to fight and exfil out of the situation, but he can't with me up above. But here comes one of the NVA. He comes right up to the log and steps over and steps right on me. I put my car 15 into his belly and I pull the trigger all 20 rounds. I made a big, gapping hold all the way through him, threw him over the log and I'm on the run and I've got the radio and down the hill we go and here comes 200 in VA and there point Jason is, and we're, we're bringing, um, I'm trying to get TAC air on the line.

Speaker 3:          01:46:14       I finally do. We're, we're putting tack here between them and us and I'm throwing smoke over my shoulder. Yes. Anything, anything in the smoke killer. And finally they bring some slips in and pull us out and uh, get us out of there on strings, on strings again and on the run. And so the side note to the whole mission is, I don't know how many we killed, but it was not a good day for them, but that agent orange was the only time I was ever it. And right now I've got stage four cancer from Agent Orange with a limited amount of time left. So that's why I'm glad I'm here to tell them

Speaker 5:          01:47:01       new stories. Glad you're here to airborne the um, so how many tours did you do? Was that w one tour?

Speaker 3:          01:47:13       I signed up for one, I volunteered to go into special forces when I was regular army. I volunteered regular army, went through, got special forces, volunteered Vietnam, volunteered for CCN and saw og and, and uh, did one tour and I went back home and uh, became a weapons instructor for Special Forces Training Group and uh, and got out. And so how many years was the total? Three, three years. Three years. That was it. And then what'd you do when you, when you got out? Uh, I kind of went back to Rodeo and uh, training horses and things like that. And then, uh, I sorta got calm.

Speaker 5:          01:48:00       Got Your Pos license? Yeah, I got my pilots license, fixed wing and rotary. Where you got home. How long did it take till kind of adapt to the civilian life?

Speaker 3:          01:48:10       It took about a year that, because I slept with my car, 15. And then when I was in training group, I always had all the weapons around me. I felt safe, but it, you know, 4th of July. It was always a hard one with stuff going on, you don't know. And it, it took me a while to do, to calm down and not because I had a lot of kills and you just have to work through all that all the time. And I was pretty good cause not after that, uh, period of time, you know, we'd never talked to each other. We weren't allowed to talk about it for 20 years is what I was told. So I never ever talked to anybody. I never met anybody until 2000

Speaker 5:          01:48:57       did you guys, I mean when you, when you, you guys didn't keep in touch, you guys didn't write each other or figuring out each other and I wrote each other, but he, his family moved. I only had his mother and father's address and I lost contact for 25 years. I moved, he moved, my parents moved and uh, so the Camo dropped but we were down. There was no books. No, no one, nobody could say anything. What about other team members? Other guys? Was there anyone that you kept in touch with over the next 20 years? No. So when you were done, you were done. I was done. Didn't do it. It was over. Cause I couldn't find anything, anybody

Speaker 3:          01:49:34       I didn't know anybody to talk to. So I was just done and I just let my life just, I never thought about it anymore. You know, I, I knew I did stuff but I couldn't talk about it. And I had gotten married and I told my wife about it, but, uh, we just thought that we didn't know where anybody ran. I didn't know where anybody went to. And then all of a sudden the internet came about and I typed in SF one time and a couple of emails came up, old ones I typed in and McCluskey got, he was working as an, uh, a medivac pilot and uh, he called me and you see he was on shift and he saw it and he called me and he gave me tilts phone number and I called tilt. The next day was Easter Sunday 2000. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:50:25       We're going to get ready to go to church.

Speaker 3:          01:50:26       I have, I hadn't seen him since 1968 or 69. And where were you living at the time? I lived up by you semi national park in the town called Mariposa. Beautiful. And you were just down in Oceanside? Yeah, working at the paper, the fish wrapper. So I said, well shoot, you know, uh, I, I got the phone number and I called him on Easter Sunday. He was going out the door to go to church and I said, you better sit down. This is the Frenchman that we've been, we talk every day now cause we can,

Speaker 5:          01:51:06       what did you, uh, what'd you do for a job? So you, you had to kind of continue to kind of get it out of your system, were breaking horses or whatever Rodeo for another year after you went out breaking more bones. Uh, and then you went into construction business in the construction business

Speaker 3:          01:51:23       that my father had gone into a private construction for a particular person and uh, so at left the uh, license open. So I just continued the license and he handed it over to me and I built for almost 45 years. I'm retired now.

Speaker 5:          01:51:43       What, where did you guys overlap? What was the, did you guys overlap in RTI? Idaho. Is that when you guys overlap?

Speaker 8:          01:51:50       Well, we are at food. When he came in, he came with a Bubba. Okay. And so McGovern got him first before I were talk to him and I got bubba. So we're in camp, we're training together at the firing range. Then Bob and I were doing our targets that they're doing theirs. And um, then when we moved, he was, he closed out fob one is the last SF troop there. His recon team closed it, locked the gate. By that time Lynn and I were down in a Denang already, so we're running missions. He went down with, with the RT Virginia with Gunther Walt. And so they went down random mission, including the famous oil drum one. And Lynn and I were doing our thing and then by April my time and country was getting close. So Lynn had agreed to be the come to one zero.

Speaker 8:          01:52:41       We had a special missing, we're supposed to go up to [inaudible] pass. We brought Doug in a Max fort and Barry and an officer to go with us on that mission. We trained for the mission train right up to it. Went to the launch site on the choppers, took off and they called us back and because two aircraft was shot down over the target area that day. And so I was about four or five days from de Roasting. We then we went back to camp, they put up the Marble Mountain. So we're up there, we have some pictures from that time there. And then, um, I walked off of Marco Mountain, went back up my gear and went home. So Doug stayed with Idaho. Got It. So from April at the end of April, all the way through October 69, he's with Idaho with willin and they ran a load of missions and I come back, he just left base crowded, but Lynn's there, southern Lynn was the one zero.

Speaker 8:          01:53:37       So he and I took turns and in find that sergeant major goes, is too much experience here, black, you're outta here. And then I went back to being a one zero for another five months and that by that time he had come home, but he's in training group. So technically he got out of the army after I did, I got out in April. And you got out in June. July, September 1st December 1st. Yeah. And so, uh, I went, my, I went back to the garden state and then he went back to California and separate ways. And we did, we had the cards in some notes. I don't think many phone calls and it just let us back if we had a couple guys. I had other people I stayed in contact with and then I just figured he got a job with a CIA or did something somewhere else, you know, and then finally got the phone call in 2000 and the rest is history.

Speaker 3:          01:54:27       And how often do you guys link up now?

Speaker 8:          01:54:29       Every day it's on the phone. Like it's like you and the Echo Charles, you know,

Speaker 3:          01:54:35       and w we, we talk almost every day and uh, because we can, we're alive and we try now to spread the story since we've been declassified. Like you're helping tremendously to spread this story, to let people know that we actually, there was a secret war going on and we were actually taking the war to the enemy because our country had signed a treaty saying that we would not go into north Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia or the DMZ. They, which we operated in every day. Right. We weren't stationed here. We just flew in by helicopters. People always ask me, well, how long did you fight in South Vietnam? I said, I never fought a day in south Vietnam. They all, you need to do anything. No, that's true. Yeah. Right.

Speaker 3:          01:55:28       It's, what was your reaction? That stuff started to Kinda come to the surface and people started talking about it. Uh, it was a slow, pretty been a slow process. Uh, I've got to hold a tilt and then we saw each other the very first time after all those years, like he was standing on a corner when I drove by and picked him up. Yeah. And we went, yeah, we went to an air show. And, uh, we started talking, we had our, uh, photo albums that we weren't supposed to have cause no pictures was supposed to be taken. Look at all the pictures that are out there. Good recon men always do whatever they want. Right. So w w but it's been a slow, he says, well we have a reunion now. I really, we'd have it in Vegas every October now. And uh, it's been going on what, 45 years?

Speaker 3:          01:56:20       43 44 years. 44 years worth. I, I've been there about 18 years now. Special Operations Association. Yup. And, uh, so we go there and see each other and sit around and drink. And of course I don't drink, but you know, we, everybody drinks and it's a free bar and, and tell old war stories to each other and just a couple of lies and stories get more exaggerated. And, but we, we have, uh, we, we have the opposite problem is we're dying faster than, than you can. We're, we were losing about 10 or 12 tops, six, seven in the very beginning. Now we're losing over 50 a year and there weren't that many of us to start with, but this is a combined all the support troops, actual recon troops, there's probably not but 45 or 50 there at all at all because we only had what, 450 [inaudible] passenger you talk to, you know. And so, uh, we have this great reunion every year and I just never miss it because I don't know who's going to die, but it's like, uh, yesterday was our interpreter hepps two year anniversary of his death and most everybody's going down with Agent Orange of some kind of cancer and stuff. Uh, LDN Bardwell just went down from an accident. Uh, he was our two star general, very proud of him, but at the time he was, we were both shocked

Speaker 5:          01:57:50       in Germany was where I didn't, I, my, my boss would work directly for him, so I was, I was under his command, but my, my boss at the time just, you know, just absolutely loved them and, and you know, tried to tell me, try to give me quotes when he'd come back from a meeting with bars. Well, he said, Barb old Dan said this, no old man said that, you know, he, he was just a [inaudible] my

Speaker 3:          01:58:08       house not too long before that. And, and uh, in my train room, I, I've got trains Lionel and, uh, he was there and had a great time. They were roommates for a few months and we went on R and r together. I've met his first son, uh, when he was two months old. Yeah. And you know, remember story with Elvin getting shot in the chest. Yeah. So two days later, Elden and Doug went to Hawaiian with their respective wives for R. And. R. They're there for five days in Elden met

Speaker 8:          01:58:42       his son for the first time. His eldest son Brandt Brandt grant was here. So you guys must have watched him cause he was, you know, uh, uh, a general in the army and he was in the limelight for sure for a military guy. And you guys knew the whole time you're looking at him thinking, Hey, we'll just call him specialist fourth class. Cause that's the way we knew I could never call him general. I could never call him barge you. I called him Elden, you know, spent four Elvin and he was the same Elden that we met in 68 is the same outlet with went to reunion with his last year. He was there and as we spend a glory and uh, know that's the way we respect him. Like when my son got a wounded and in Iraq he went and saw this care at the hospital, picked up for him right away. They couldn't believe at two star general walk in for some little girl. Yeah, some of those best. He's a scout and he got banged up with a Humvee. Really bad. But the Elton was, what year was at, uh, August 20th, 2005 a couple of weeks later. You were in country then? I W I didn't while I was in there. Oh, three Oh four. And you know six. Where, do you know where it was in Iraq? Yeah, he was southeast of the Green Zone. Okay. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:59:59       Small world. What's he doing now? He's up at doing heavy equipment training up in a long beach. Him and Bruno, his faithful companion or they're doing it and just kicking ass. Take a number. So pretty soon have all the licenses in place and if you need any, uh, heavy equipment work, give him a call right on. And a freshman will build a house for you. Adrian, what about, so you

Speaker 3:          02:00:23       got, you got, you got married when you got done. Is that or along the way? Along the way? Yeah. And did you have any kids? I have a son and I have a daughter. I've got a grandson and two granddaughters. Very proud of them. I'm really proud of my son. He, he has his own company in the oil business doing really well. He would pairs all the big fracking machines. Yeah. Um, I'm right now, I'm in Texas. I was in Tennessee when I'm in Texas now. Now that I've found out what my medical health is, I want to try to get my grandson to, uh, know me before I go. Well, that's, that's awesome. He's going to be as proud as he can be. As proud of you as you are of him. That's for damn sure. Well, they made an action figure of me, so I've left that action figure for him.

Speaker 3:          02:01:14       And that's the famous picture. Yes. The famous SOG. Uh, the Frenchmen. Yes. I've seen it. There's a good review of it on, on uh, youtube I watched. Yeah. The, you can go to youtube and look up Frenchmen action figure and it's done really well by Ryan Peters. Yeah. He did a really excellent job. Even made the box and everything for it. Yeah, no, it looks, it's pretty awesome. Well, I'll definitely, I'll definitely post the data. That picture when, when this goes up, when this goes out onto the, uh, on the interwebs, as they say. And you've got your freshman challenge coin. I got my freshman challenge coin. Yeah. It's right here. The lowest ranking challenge coming out there makes the general's MBA. It's a PFC challenge.

Speaker 8:          02:02:05       It doesn't get much better than that. Yeah, for sure. Uh, you got anything else? I think this is a good place to be and if you listen to this and you think of more things you want to say, but you know, I think this is a good, good spot to wrap up this one. So if you've got anything until you got anything else first. No, the stories. Um, you know, it's funny because even we were in base, we never knew a lot of the details and so when I put the books together, talked to other people, like the oil drums story, we learned about 40 years later that Lynn black had done a similar thing with RTI, Idaho after I left right in between these guys. And it's just like a lot of histories that comes out slowly. Like Doug said,

Speaker 3:          02:02:52       was anyone tracking? Was anyone writing down the history as it was happening? Was anyone taking the operational summaries and compiling them somewhere? They were all destroyed. That was when I left Fubu by one of my jobs was to go through and make sure that all the drums had been note the ashes. They had burnt all the reports after action reports were all burnt and then as we pulled out of every fob and closed down CCN and CCS and CCC, we closed them all down. Everything was destroyed. There's very few after action reports with their rs, just minuscule reports. People try to put them out on Ebay, but their fake, there just isn't any

Speaker 8:          02:03:39       think there are out there. We, we haven't. There are reports of archives that were even now began to look into, but at a recent reunion, a guy came up to me and said, hey, you know, if you'd done your books, I got, I like to talk to you because my job when we closed cartoon was to destroy all the records. Yeah, yeah. Lot of valor.

Speaker 3:          02:04:03       Yeah, we, that's why the upset, I didn't even receive my purple heart for that first mission until 11, 11, 11. Rio had to go back to the paperwork on it and we had to find years and a lot of people and, and, uh, a lot of affidavits and a lot of this and a lot of that. And it took six years. And until Diane Black, my congresswoman, uh, called me one day. I was coming back from Arlington, from burying Gunther Wall and, and my Virginia team, Donnie shoe, and, and, um, Bill Brown, William Brown. And uh, she calls me on the phone. I don't even know who she is. She says, are you Douglas Eternal, the Frenchman? I said, uh, yes. And she says, I'm Diane Black Congressman for Tennessee, for your district, for your district. And I'm in my limousine right now and I'm holding a purple heart in my hand. How do you want it presented? I said, I want you to pin it on front of our memorial in Gallatin, Tennessee. And, uh, she did on 11, 11, 11. And my guys came and watched. I had seven of my saugers come to that and watched tilt came. Everybody flew in, we were there, they were there for witness.

Speaker 8:          02:05:36       And even though we found one to medics, they had pulled that this string out from this trapping as an eye witness. That's, that was a key thing. We got the CEO to do a letter but took a while to track it down and put it together. But we did

Speaker 3:          02:05:49       cause all the records had been destroyed, you know, so. Well this record won't be destroyed right here. I promise you that podcast one eight six one eight six. There you go. But I would like to say as a closing thing, my mom and dad are both gone. My Dad was a hero. He gave me everything he had to give. He was the best father ever. My mother was the best mother. I'm proud of my kids, my daughter and my son. What they've accomplished in their lives. I'm proud of my grandkids and what they do. And uh, I'm glad that I have something to leave behind.

Speaker 8:          02:06:28       And his mom when she, when she'd learned my mother died, I got a phone call next day till your mom's dead bottom of your mom.

Speaker 3:          02:06:38       Yep. My mom loved every one of them. Bubba came to La and said, I need a bunk up for a couple days. Six and a half months later. And He'd gone through the LAPD and six and a half months later, he even got married and brought his wife into the house. My Mom and dad finally said, enough's enough for your wedding present. We're giving you an apartment date. But any Sauger was welcomed in my mom and dad's house. Oh yeah. Well, uh,

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       have departed. Awesome. What an a, what an honor and a half those guys on. And I've got to say this right after we got done, of course were we did some more talking and the Frenchman was, was explaining the fact that when he would go out on a mission, every mission he would go out on, he would square away his footlocker, make sure everything was ready to be shipped home because every time he went out he figured he would not be coming back.

Speaker 6:          02:11:08       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:11:12       real heroes. And it's awesome to be able to sit here and talk to those guys and what a, what an honor that is. And anyways, um, you know, actually one of the reasons that I can sit here and talk to guys like tilt and the French men is because of all the support that comes in from all of you. So appreciate you know that because as you know, I don't have any like regular whatever they're called advertisements on here, cause I'm not going to interrupt someone like tilt or someone like the French or someone like BTF Tony or someone like Dakota Meyer.
