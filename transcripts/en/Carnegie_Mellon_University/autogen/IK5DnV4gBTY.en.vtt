atoms would bind together and form
 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.449
atoms would bind together and form
solids so they pictured atoms as having

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459
solids so they pictured atoms as having
 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.229
solids so they pictured atoms as having
hooks and so the idea is how do you put

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239
hooks and so the idea is how do you put
 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.449
hooks and so the idea is how do you put
atoms together so that they'll form

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459
atoms together so that they'll form
 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.270
atoms together so that they'll form
solids and the way we do it nowadays is

prove for example he went to Professor

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:35.599
prove for example he went to Professor
 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:39.339
prove for example he went to Professor
Dr Weber around 1900 and he proposed

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:39.349
Dr Weber around 1900 and he proposed
 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:42.189
Dr Weber around 1900 and he proposed
that we should measure the speed of

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199
that we should measure the speed of
 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:45.879
that we should measure the speed of
light in different directions and later

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889
light in different directions and later
 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:48.070
light in different directions and later
this experiment was done by Michelson

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080
this experiment was done by Michelson
 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.589
this experiment was done by Michelson
and this was the first Nobel Prize for

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:50.599
and this was the first Nobel Prize for
 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:55.450
and this was the first Nobel Prize for
an American but professor Weber rejected

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460
an American but professor Weber rejected
 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.570
an American but professor Weber rejected
that as an idea for a thesis so I hope

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580
that as an idea for a thesis so I hope
 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.010
that as an idea for a thesis so I hope
their students out there that can

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020
their students out there that can
 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.579
their students out there that can
identify with this kind of thing but he

00:05:03.579 --> 00:05:03.589
identify with this kind of thing but he
 

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:06.249
identify with this kind of thing but he
went back and he proposed to work on the

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:06.259
went back and he proposed to work on the
 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:09.369
went back and he proposed to work on the
effect of how heat changes the

00:05:09.369 --> 00:05:09.379
effect of how heat changes the
 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:12.369
effect of how heat changes the
electrical conductivity of solids and

00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:12.379
electrical conductivity of solids and
 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:16.059
electrical conductivity of solids and
the conductance of solids and this is a

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:16.069
the conductance of solids and this is a
 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:18.249
the conductance of solids and this is a
very important problem particularly now

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:18.259
very important problem particularly now
 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:20.980
very important problem particularly now
in electronics and unfortunately Weber

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990
in electronics and unfortunately Weber
 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.820
in electronics and unfortunately Weber
didn't see the use of this so he tried

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830
didn't see the use of this so he tried
 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.480
didn't see the use of this so he tried
again and he took the other approach

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490
again and he took the other approach
 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.639
again and he took the other approach
with he said let's look at how heat

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:30.649
with he said let's look at how heat
 

00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:33.429
with he said let's look at how heat
flows through solids and he developed

00:05:33.429 --> 00:05:33.439
flows through solids and he developed
 

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:35.439
flows through solids and he developed
the theory and he wanted to use that for

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:35.449
the theory and he wanted to use that for
 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:38.649
the theory and he wanted to use that for
his thesis but he wrote it on the wrong

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:38.659
his thesis but he wrote it on the wrong
 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:41.800
his thesis but he wrote it on the wrong
kind of paper Weber was angry by this

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810
kind of paper Weber was angry by this
 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.309

Einstein and so he said no so he went to

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360
Einstein and so he said no so he went to
 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.269
Einstein and so he said no so he went to
Professor dr. kleiner and he wanted to

00:05:55.269 --> 00:05:55.279
Professor dr. kleiner and he wanted to
 

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:57.969
Professor dr. kleiner and he wanted to
talk about a very and work on a very

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:57.979
talk about a very and work on a very
 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:05:59.889
talk about a very and work on a very
important problem which is you take

00:05:59.889 --> 00:05:59.899
important problem which is you take
 

00:05:59.899 --> 00:06:02.559
important problem which is you take
gases and you have isolated atoms and

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:02.569
gases and you have isolated atoms and
 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:04.269
gases and you have isolated atoms and
you bring them closer and closer

00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:04.279
you bring them closer and closer
 

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:06.309
you bring them closer and closer
together so the atoms start interacting

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:06.319
together so the atoms start interacting
 

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:08.769
together so the atoms start interacting
with one another and they form a liquid

00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:08.779
with one another and they form a liquid
 

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:10.570
with one another and they form a liquid
and then you squeeze more in to become a

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580
and then you squeeze more in to become a
 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.369
and then you squeeze more in to become a
solid so you want to work on

00:06:12.369 --> 00:06:12.379
solid so you want to work on
 

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:14.769
solid so you want to work on

probability density for electrons and
the question is how do you take a system

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:21.860
the question is how do you take a system
 

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.800
the question is how do you take a system
like that put those things together and

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:23.810
like that put those things together and
 

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:28.450
like that put those things together and
make solids out of them and there is a

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:28.460
make solids out of them and there is a
 

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.880
make solids out of them and there is a
philosophical aspect to this that I

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:30.890
philosophical aspect to this that I
 

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:32.500
philosophical aspect to this that I
thought I'd bring up because many

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:32.510
thought I'd bring up because many
 

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:34.240
thought I'd bring up because many
physicists are talking about this

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:34.250
physicists are talking about this
 

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:35.710
physicists are talking about this
although usually when you talk about

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:35.720
although usually when you talk about
 

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.160
although usually when you talk about
philosophy of science physicists sort of

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:39.170
philosophy of science physicists sort of
 

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:41.050
philosophy of science physicists sort of
leave the room saying that the

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:41.060
leave the room saying that the
 

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.360
leave the room saying that the
philosophers don't know what's going on

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:43.370
philosophers don't know what's going on
 

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:46.600
philosophers don't know what's going on
but this argument has been going on and

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:46.610
but this argument has been going on and
 

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:49.420
but this argument has been going on and
it's and it's interesting to look at it

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:49.430
it's and it's interesting to look at it
 

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:51.400
it's and it's interesting to look at it
in the light of this field of condensed

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:51.410
in the light of this field of condensed
 

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:53.890
in the light of this field of condensed
matter physics so I want to put these

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:53.900
matter physics so I want to put these
 

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.530
matter physics so I want to put these
atoms together and I want to get a

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:56.540
atoms together and I want to get a
 

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.690
atoms together and I want to get a
mental picture of what a solid is like

00:09:58.690 --> 00:09:58.700
mental picture of what a solid is like
 

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.930
mental picture of what a solid is like
and there's two fundamental models that

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:01.940
and there's two fundamental models that
 

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.180
and there's two fundamental models that
have developed over the years one is

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:04.190
have developed over the years one is
 

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:06.280
have developed over the years one is
that the atoms just interact with each

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:06.290
that the atoms just interact with each
 

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.350
that the atoms just interact with each
other so I should start with the atoms

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:08.360
other so I should start with the atoms
 

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.600
other so I should start with the atoms
and see how they're changed and another

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:10.610
and see how they're changed and another
 

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.400
and see how they're changed and another
one is called the elementary excitation

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:12.410
one is called the elementary excitation
 

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:14.140
one is called the elementary excitation
model and I'll tell you what that is in

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:14.150
model and I'll tell you what that is in
 

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:18.370
model and I'll tell you what that is in
a moment in the interacting atoms model

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:18.380
a moment in the interacting atoms model
 

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.410
a moment in the interacting atoms model
you say a solid is a collection of

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:20.420
you say a solid is a collection of
 

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:23.470
you say a solid is a collection of
strongly interacting atoms and from the

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:23.480
strongly interacting atoms and from the
 

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.120
strongly interacting atoms and from the
philosophers point of view this is

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:25.130
philosophers point of view this is
 

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:28.240
philosophers point of view this is
called reductionism if I say I know the

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:28.250
called reductionism if I say I know the
 

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:30.130
called reductionism if I say I know the
particles are these nuclei and electrons

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:30.140
particles are these nuclei and electrons
 

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.210
particles are these nuclei and electrons
I know that the interact through

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:33.220
I know that the interact through
 

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.530
I know that the interact through
electromagnetic interactions because the

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:35.540
electromagnetic interactions because the
 

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.540
electromagnetic interactions because the
other interactions that gravity and so

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:37.550
other interactions that gravity and so
 

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:40.390
other interactions that gravity and so
forth are too weak on this level this is

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:40.400
forth are too weak on this level this is
 

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.660
forth are too weak on this level this is
the appropriate system and so I should

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:43.670
the appropriate system and so I should
 

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:46.000
the appropriate system and so I should
be able to start from atoms and tell

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:46.010
be able to start from atoms and tell
 

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:49.210
be able to start from atoms and tell
everything and so this is one approach

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:49.220
everything and so this is one approach
 

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:52.720
everything and so this is one approach
and as Fred mentioned the pseudo

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:52.730
and as Fred mentioned the pseudo
 

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:55.300
and as Fred mentioned the pseudo
potential what the pseudo potential does

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:55.310
potential what the pseudo potential does
 

00:10:55.310 --> 00:11:00.160
potential what the pseudo potential does
is if I line up my atoms in some

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:00.170
is if I line up my atoms in some
 

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:05.110
is if I line up my atoms in some
specific order then the nuclei will

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:05.120
specific order then the nuclei will
 

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.360
specific order then the nuclei will
which is the dark part at the center I

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:07.370
which is the dark part at the center I
 

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.650
which is the dark part at the center I
think this has a laser on it

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:10.660
think this has a laser on it
 

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:15.520
think this has a laser on it
anyway is it China okay

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:15.530
anyway is it China okay
 

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:18.040
anyway is it China okay
the nucleus is this dark part it doesn't

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:18.050
the nucleus is this dark part it doesn't
 

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:20.320
the nucleus is this dark part it doesn't
really make much difference when you

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:20.330
really make much difference when you
 

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.380
really make much difference when you
form a solid for the nucleus it doesn't

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:23.390
form a solid for the nucleus it doesn't
 

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:25.750
form a solid for the nucleus it doesn't
change very much so there are core

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:25.760
change very much so there are core
 

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.940
change very much so there are core
electrons for example if this is silicon

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:27.950
electrons for example if this is silicon
 

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:30.850
electrons for example if this is silicon
it has ten electrons this is very close

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:30.860
it has ten electrons this is very close
 

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.440
it has ten electrons this is very close
to the core and they don't change very

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:32.450
to the core and they don't change very
 

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:32.980
to the core and they don't change very
much

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:32.990
much
 

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:35.350
much
and then those extra four electrons form

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360
and then those extra four electrons form
 

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.960
and then those extra four electrons form
this fuzzy soup that make up the

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:37.970
this fuzzy soup that make up the
 

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:41.980
this fuzzy soup that make up the
properties of the solid so in fact if I

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:41.990
properties of the solid so in fact if I
 

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:43.990
properties of the solid so in fact if I
can calculate the energy of this whole

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.000
can calculate the energy of this whole
 

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.840
can calculate the energy of this whole
thing and then move these atoms around

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:46.850
thing and then move these atoms around
 

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:49.780
thing and then move these atoms around
and look for the lowest energy nature

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:49.790
and look for the lowest energy nature
 

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:51.340
and look for the lowest energy nature
always wants the lowest energy I can

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:51.350
always wants the lowest energy I can
 

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:53.530
always wants the lowest energy I can
tell you the structure of silicon

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:53.540
tell you the structure of silicon
 

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:57.010
tell you the structure of silicon
knowing only the number of electrons and

00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:57.020
knowing only the number of electrons and
 

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:59.410
knowing only the number of electrons and
how the electrons interact with the core

00:11:59.410 --> 00:11:59.420
how the electrons interact with the core
 

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.870
how the electrons interact with the core
and that's the pseudo potential and we

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:01.880
and that's the pseudo potential and we
 

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.360
and that's the pseudo potential and we
can build the pseudo potential for any

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:04.370
can build the pseudo potential for any
 

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:07.960
can build the pseudo potential for any
atom in the periodic table when you

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:07.970
atom in the periodic table when you
 

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:10.090
atom in the periodic table when you
teach solid-state physics you talk about

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:10.100
teach solid-state physics you talk about
 

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:14.140
teach solid-state physics you talk about
silicon in diamond and so this is a an

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:14.150
silicon in diamond and so this is a an
 

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:17.170
silicon in diamond and so this is a an
old view graph and you say that each

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:17.180
old view graph and you say that each
 

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:20.140
old view graph and you say that each
silicon atom is surrounded by four other

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:20.150
silicon atom is surrounded by four other
 

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:22.180
silicon atom is surrounded by four other
silicon atoms and this is the same thing

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:22.190
silicon atoms and this is the same thing
 

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:23.770
silicon atoms and this is the same thing
whether if this were carbon and that

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:23.780
whether if this were carbon and that
 

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:26.290
whether if this were carbon and that
would be diamond it's a very strong bond

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:26.300
would be diamond it's a very strong bond
 

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.720
would be diamond it's a very strong bond
there's a ball and stick model these are

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:28.730
there's a ball and stick model these are
 

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:31.360
there's a ball and stick model these are
those atoms and those are the sticks and

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:31.370
those atoms and those are the sticks and
 

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:33.730
those atoms and those are the sticks and
the sticks of the valence electrons well

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:33.740
the sticks of the valence electrons well
 

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.860
the sticks of the valence electrons well
now you can go in theoretically and

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:35.870
now you can go in theoretically and
 

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:38.440
now you can go in theoretically and
calculate where the electrons are and as

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:38.450
calculate where the electrons are and as
 

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:41.200
calculate where the electrons are and as
I mentioned it's a probability so the

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:41.210
I mentioned it's a probability so the
 

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:43.090
I mentioned it's a probability so the
probability density is that the

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:43.100
probability density is that the
 

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:46.150
probability density is that the
electrons will pile up halfway between

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.160
electrons will pile up halfway between
 

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.720
electrons will pile up halfway between
the two silicon atoms and form the bond

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:48.730
the two silicon atoms and form the bond
 

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:52.390
the two silicon atoms and form the bond
and this is an honest theoretical piece

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:52.400
and this is an honest theoretical piece
 

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.160
and this is an honest theoretical piece
of work because it came before the

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:54.170
of work because it came before the
 

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:56.320
of work because it came before the
experiment and the experiment came

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:56.330
experiment and the experiment came
 

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.210
experiment and the experiment came
afterward and you can see the

00:12:58.210 --> 00:12:58.220
afterward and you can see the
 

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:02.110
afterward and you can see the
similarities between the covalent bond

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:02.120
similarities between the covalent bond
 

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.180
similarities between the covalent bond
so this is one of the strongest bonds in

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:04.190
so this is one of the strongest bonds in
 

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:06.880
so this is one of the strongest bonds in
nature it's a covalent bond and although

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:06.890
nature it's a covalent bond and although
 

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:09.150
nature it's a covalent bond and although
this is for silicon it would look

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:09.160
this is for silicon it would look
 

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:13.690
this is for silicon it would look
similar for other materials so with this

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:13.700
similar for other materials so with this
 

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.690
similar for other materials so with this
method using this approach for a broad

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:16.700
method using this approach for a broad
 

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.940
method using this approach for a broad
class of solids and clusters and

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:18.950
class of solids and clusters and
 

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:21.370
class of solids and clusters and
molecules and the rest we can tell you

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:21.380
molecules and the rest we can tell you
 

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:23.060
molecules and the rest we can tell you
where the electrons are

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:23.070
where the electrons are
 

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.980

we can actually predict crystal

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:25.990
we can actually predict crystal
 

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:28.230
we can actually predict crystal
structures because we can actually tell

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:28.240
structures because we can actually tell
 

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.570
structures because we can actually tell
you how far apart the atoms will be by

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:30.580
you how far apart the atoms will be by
 

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:34.350
you how far apart the atoms will be by
choosing the lowest energy and we can

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:34.360
choosing the lowest energy and we can
 

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.210
choosing the lowest energy and we can
get this whole list this is the

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:36.220

so at one point we were labeled quantum

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:44.230
so at one point we were labeled quantum

The New Yorker you've seen her cartoons
 

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:59.190
The New Yorker you've seen her cartoons
and she pictured the quantum alchemists

students and computers and this was at a

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:05.230
students and computers and this was at a
 

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:06.900
students and computers and this was at a
time when we were looking at the

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:06.910
time when we were looking at the
 

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:08.700
time when we were looking at the
possibility of making things that are

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:08.710
possibility of making things that are
 

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:12.330
possibility of making things that are
harder than diamond now from the

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:12.340
harder than diamond now from the
 

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:14.550
harder than diamond now from the
philosophical point of view there's

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:14.560
philosophical point of view there's
 

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.910
philosophical point of view there's
another approach and it's actually a

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:17.920
another approach and it's actually a
 

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:21.390
another approach and it's actually a
practical approach and that is if I

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:21.400
practical approach and that is if I
 

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.960
practical approach and that is if I
claim that all I know about the solid

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:24.970
claim that all I know about the solid
 

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:27.900
claim that all I know about the solid
this is a picture of the solid is what I

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:27.910
this is a picture of the solid is what I
 

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:32.310
this is a picture of the solid is what I
measure and if I probe the solid I'll

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:32.320
measure and if I probe the solid I'll
 

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.950
measure and if I probe the solid I'll
measure different things and then what

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:34.960
measure different things and then what
 

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.980
measure different things and then what
goes on in the black box is something

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:37.990
goes on in the black box is something
 

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:40.590
goes on in the black box is something
that I can think of in another way so

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:40.600
that I can think of in another way so
 

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.650
that I can think of in another way so
let me give you an example if I shine

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:43.660
let me give you an example if I shine
 

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:46.980
let me give you an example if I shine
light on a solid and I want to know how

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:46.990
light on a solid and I want to know how
 

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:48.750
light on a solid and I want to know how
the solids reacting I measure the

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:48.760
the solids reacting I measure the
 

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:51.690
the solids reacting I measure the
reflectivity and when I measure the

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:51.700
reflectivity and when I measure the
 

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.640
reflectivity and when I measure the
reflectivity if I can explain that

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:53.650
reflectivity if I can explain that
 

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:55.290
reflectivity if I can explain that
reflectivity in terms of fictitious

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:55.300
reflectivity in terms of fictitious
 

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:57.750
reflectivity in terms of fictitious
particles let's say I didn't know that

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:57.760
particles let's say I didn't know that
 

00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.610
particles let's say I didn't know that
it was made of electrons and so forth

00:14:59.610 --> 00:14:59.620
it was made of electrons and so forth
 

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:02.640
it was made of electrons and so forth
then I have a theory and you may say

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:02.650
then I have a theory and you may say
 

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:03.930
then I have a theory and you may say
that that's cheating

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:03.940
that that's cheating
 

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.200
that that's cheating
but I'll I'll take you further along

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:07.210
but I'll I'll take you further along
 

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:09.720
but I'll I'll take you further along
here let's say I put temperature in I

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:09.730
here let's say I put temperature in I
 

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:12.150
here let's say I put temperature in I
measure the heat capacity which is how

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.160
measure the heat capacity which is how
 

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.060
measure the heat capacity which is how
the solid heats up when how much energy

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:15.070
the solid heats up when how much energy
 

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:17.400
the solid heats up when how much energy
goes in when I raise the temperature or

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:17.410
goes in when I raise the temperature or
 

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:19.950
goes in when I raise the temperature or
I can put on a magnetic field or

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:19.960
I can put on a magnetic field or
 

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.310
I can put on a magnetic field or
whatever so the idea is this picture has

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:23.320
whatever so the idea is this picture has
 

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:27.960
whatever so the idea is this picture has
a probe and you measure the response and

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:27.970
a probe and you measure the response and
 

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:33.930
a probe and you measure the response and
the idea is that particles that explain

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:33.940
the idea is that particles that explain
 

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:36.210
the idea is that particles that explain
the properties emerge

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:36.220
the properties emerge
 

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:39.540
the properties emerge
and this is emergence theory

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:39.550
and this is emergence theory
 

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:41.640
and this is emergence theory
so the philosopher would say that the

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:41.650
so the philosopher would say that the
 

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:43.680
so the philosopher would say that the
earlier model where I put atoms together

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:43.690
earlier model where I put atoms together
 

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:44.970
earlier model where I put atoms together
is called a reductionist

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:44.980
is called a reductionist
 

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.730
is called a reductionist
model and the emergent model is like a

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:47.740
model and the emergent model is like a
 

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:50.850
model and the emergent model is like a
model that biologists use where does

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:50.860
model that biologists use where does
 

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:53.100
model that biologists use where does
life come from well it emerges you put

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:53.110
life come from well it emerges you put
 

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:55.320
life come from well it emerges you put
all this stuff together and all of a

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:55.330
all this stuff together and all of a
 

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:57.270
all this stuff together and all of a
sudden that says lo and you have

00:15:57.270 --> 00:15:57.280
sudden that says lo and you have
 

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.030
sudden that says lo and you have
consciousness and life well here for

solid with a hammer the atoms are going

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:05.950
solid with a hammer the atoms are going
 

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:08.700
solid with a hammer the atoms are going
to vibrate and they'll produce sound

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:08.710
to vibrate and they'll produce sound
 

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:11.520
to vibrate and they'll produce sound
waves and you can think of those sound

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:11.530
waves and you can think of those sound
 

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:14.250
waves and you can think of those sound
waves as particles called phonons and

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:14.260
waves as particles called phonons and
 

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.670
waves as particles called phonons and
those phonons become real to you because

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680
those phonons become real to you because
 

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.310
those phonons become real to you because
you can explain the properties all the

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:20.320
you can explain the properties all the
 

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.720
you can explain the properties all the
responses in terms of these photons an

responses in terms of these photons an
excellent example is the concept of a

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:26.710
excellent example is the concept of a

you know all the way out in in a
 

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:39.900
you know all the way out in in a
semiconductor and you take one out you

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:39.910
semiconductor and you take one out you

shine light and take one out it's a lot

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:42.760
shine light and take one out it's a lot
 

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.820
shine light and take one out it's a lot
more convenient to talk about the

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:44.830
more convenient to talk about the
 

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:47.370
more convenient to talk about the

can't throw a hole across the room
 

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:57.540
can't throw a hole across the room
whereas principle you can throw an

about these things barracks in and talk
 

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:28.860
about these things barracks in and talk
to Einstein a great deal because he

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:28.870
to Einstein a great deal because he
 

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:30.030
to Einstein a great deal because he
didn't believe in the theory of

00:22:12.039 --> 00:22:12.049
instead of having 3 4 neighbors like a
 

00:22:12.049 --> 00:22:13.799
instead of having 3 4 neighbors like a
dozen diamond like I showed you before

00:22:13.799 --> 00:22:13.809
dozen diamond like I showed you before
 

00:22:13.809 --> 00:22:14.980
dozen diamond like I showed you before
car

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:14.990
car
 

00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:17.410
car
has the unusual property that it can

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:17.420
has the unusual property that it can
 

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:19.180
has the unusual property that it can
also have three neighbors and be a

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:19.190
also have three neighbors and be a
 

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:21.760
also have three neighbors and be a
layered material and that's why we're

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:21.770
layered material and that's why we're
 

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:23.950
layered material and that's why we're
alive because carbon can form these

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:23.960
alive because carbon can form these
 

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:27.340
alive because carbon can form these
multiple bonds silicon can't and it can

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:27.350
multiple bonds silicon can't and it can
 

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:28.870
multiple bonds silicon can't and it can
form these multiple bonds and make

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:28.880
form these multiple bonds and make
 

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:33.100
form these multiple bonds and make
organic compounds and so it forms these

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:33.110
organic compounds and so it forms these
 

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:36.520
organic compounds and so it forms these
layers and in your pencil when you write

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:36.530
layers and in your pencil when you write
 

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:39.400
layers and in your pencil when you write
these layers come off and that's what

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:39.410
these layers come off and that's what
 

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:42.520
these layers come off and that's what
the writing is so these very very

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:42.530
the writing is so these very very
 

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:46.330
the writing is so these very very
strongly bonded layers are connected

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:46.340
strongly bonded layers are connected
 

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.760
strongly bonded layers are connected
very weakly to each others one stack on

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:48.770
very weakly to each others one stack on
 

00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:51.160
very weakly to each others one stack on
top of another and they rub off from one

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:51.170
top of another and they rub off from one
 

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:55.150
top of another and they rub off from one
another and so what happened was people

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:55.160
another and so what happened was people
 

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:58.000
another and so what happened was people
wanted to work just on the layers they

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:58.010
wanted to work just on the layers they
 

00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:00.790
wanted to work just on the layers they
didn't know how to peel it off and to

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:00.800
didn't know how to peel it off and to
 

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.169
didn't know how to peel it off and to
researchers I'll give you their names

00:23:02.169 --> 00:23:02.179
researchers I'll give you their names
 

00:23:02.179 --> 00:23:06.299
researchers I'll give you their names
later took scotch tape put it on top of

00:23:06.299 --> 00:23:06.309
later took scotch tape put it on top of
 

00:23:06.309 --> 00:23:09.700
later took scotch tape put it on top of
graphite which is pencil led and peeled

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:09.710
graphite which is pencil led and peeled
 

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:12.490
graphite which is pencil led and peeled
it off and got individual layers and

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:12.500
it off and got individual layers and
 

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:17.100
it off and got individual layers and
then very soon after got the Nobel Prize

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:17.110
 

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:21.460
so this is what a picture of what a

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:21.470
so this is what a picture of what a
 

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:23.620
so this is what a picture of what a
layer of graphene would look like all

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:23.630
layer of graphene would look like all
 

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:26.260
layer of graphene would look like all
these hexagons and if you cut out the

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:26.270
these hexagons and if you cut out the
 

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:28.540
these hexagons and if you cut out the
appropriate geometry you can bend them

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:28.550
appropriate geometry you can bend them
 

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:30.990
appropriate geometry you can bend them
around and make a buckyball which is a

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:31.000
around and make a buckyball which is a
 

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.690
around and make a buckyball which is a
60 atom molecule or if you just roll up

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:34.700
60 atom molecule or if you just roll up
 

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:38.140

of graphene you make a carbon nanotube

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:41.300
of graphene you make a carbon nanotube
 

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:44.799
of graphene you make a carbon nanotube
and you can look at graphene ribbons

00:23:44.799 --> 00:23:44.809
and you can look at graphene ribbons
 

00:23:44.809 --> 00:23:47.110
and you can look at graphene ribbons
which is slices of these people can cut

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:47.120
which is slices of these people can cut
 

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:50.020
which is slices of these people can cut
these out and single layer by layer and

these out and single layer by layer and
 

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:55.419
these out and single layer by layer and
so forth and this is the current rate so

strong enough and then Sir Arthur Clarke

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:13.380
strong enough and then Sir Arthur Clarke
 

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:17.120
strong enough and then Sir Arthur Clarke
the science fiction writer said that you

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:17.130
the science fiction writer said that you
 

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:19.190
the science fiction writer said that you
could get satellites going around the

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200
could get satellites going around the
 

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.630
could get satellites going around the
earth and you put them in the right

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640
earth and you put them in the right
 

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.270
earth and you put them in the right
orbit they'll stay right over one place

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:23.280
orbit they'll stay right over one place
 

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:25.700
orbit they'll stay right over one place
in other words as the Earth rotates it

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:25.710
in other words as the Earth rotates it
 

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:27.260

above Carnegie Mellon you know all you

00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:29.820
above Carnegie Mellon you know all you
 

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:31.370
above Carnegie Mellon you know all you
have to do is build a cable and you can

00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:31.380
have to do is build a cable and you can
 

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:33.350
have to do is build a cable and you can
take things up and bring things down and

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360
take things up and bring things down and
 

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:36.159
take things up and bring things down and
all the rest and so there is a project

00:25:36.159 --> 00:25:36.169
all the rest and so there is a project
 

00:25:36.169 --> 00:25:40.279
all the rest and so there is a project
primarily at Los Alamos to make a space

00:25:40.279 --> 00:25:40.289
primarily at Los Alamos to make a space
 

00:25:40.289 --> 00:25:43.430

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.890
elevator using carbon nanotubes and
trying to see whether or not they can

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:45.900
trying to see whether or not they can
 

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:47.779
trying to see whether or not they can
take things up and down and they want to

00:25:47.779 --> 00:25:47.789
take things up and down and they want to
 

00:25:47.789 --> 00:25:50.539
take things up and down and they want to
have one going around Mars and put

00:25:50.539 --> 00:25:50.549
have one going around Mars and put
 

00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:53.149
have one going around Mars and put
things down and up if you actually

00:25:53.149 --> 00:25:53.159
things down and up if you actually
 

00:25:53.159 --> 00:25:55.370
things down and up if you actually
calculate the strength of the carbon

00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:55.380
calculate the strength of the carbon
 

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:57.110
calculate the strength of the carbon
nanotube which is about the strongest

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:57.120
nanotube which is about the strongest
 

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.669
nanotube which is about the strongest
material in the world if you pull it

00:25:58.669 --> 00:25:58.679
material in the world if you pull it
 

00:25:58.679 --> 00:26:01.840
material in the world if you pull it
this way you find it's about a tenth of

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:01.850
this way you find it's about a tenth of
 

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:05.419
this way you find it's about a tenth of
the you know it's a tenth of the

00:26:05.419 --> 00:26:05.429
the you know it's a tenth of the
 

00:26:05.429 --> 00:26:07.310
the you know it's a tenth of the
strength that you need to even have

00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:07.320
strength that you need to even have
 

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:10.039
strength that you need to even have
something that long but they're trying

00:26:10.039 --> 00:26:10.049
something that long but they're trying
 

00:26:10.049 --> 00:26:12.049
something that long but they're trying
to weave these things and do all kinds

00:26:12.049 --> 00:26:12.059
to weave these things and do all kinds
 

00:26:12.059 --> 00:26:13.909
to weave these things and do all kinds
of things so I don't know about this

00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919
of things so I don't know about this
 

00:26:13.919 --> 00:26:17.180
of things so I don't know about this
project but I'll show you a project that

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:17.190
project but I'll show you a project that
 

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:20.990
project but I'll show you a project that
does work and it's very interesting the

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:21.000
does work and it's very interesting the
 

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.919
does work and it's very interesting the
carbon nanotubes actually sometimes form

00:26:24.919 --> 00:26:24.929
carbon nanotubes actually sometimes form
 

00:26:24.929 --> 00:26:27.980
carbon nanotubes actually sometimes form
is a single cylinder but they often form

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:27.990
is a single cylinder but they often form
 

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:30.680
is a single cylinder but they often form
like these Russian dolls a cylinder

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:30.690
like these Russian dolls a cylinder
 

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:32.120
like these Russian dolls a cylinder
within a cylinder within a cylinder

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:32.130
within a cylinder within a cylinder
 

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:34.909
within a cylinder within a cylinder
concentric cylinders and the

00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:34.919
concentric cylinders and the
 

00:26:34.919 --> 00:26:37.130
concentric cylinders and the
experimentalists can reach in and pull

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:37.140
experimentalists can reach in and pull
 

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:39.440
experimentalists can reach in and pull
out one of the cylinders and let it pop

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:39.450
out one of the cylinders and let it pop
 

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:41.750
out one of the cylinders and let it pop
back in and so forth

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760
back in and so forth
 

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:44.180
back in and so forth
now the cylinders themselves because the

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:44.190
now the cylinders themselves because the
 

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:47.450
now the cylinders themselves because the
bonds are very strong they retain their

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:47.460
bonds are very strong they retain their
 

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:50.120
bonds are very strong they retain their
identity they're very good but between

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:50.130
identity they're very good but between
 

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:52.280
identity they're very good but between
the cylinders as I said in graphite is

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:52.290
the cylinders as I said in graphite is
 

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:55.250
the cylinders as I said in graphite is
very weak so this has almost no friction

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:55.260
very weak so this has almost no friction
 

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:58.010
very weak so this has almost no friction
so it's like a frictionless bearing and

00:26:58.010 --> 00:26:58.020
so it's like a frictionless bearing and
 

00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:01.030
so it's like a frictionless bearing and
so the idea is to make a motor out of it

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:01.040
so the idea is to make a motor out of it
 

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.950
so the idea is to make a motor out of it
so first I'll show you the schematic of

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:03.960
so first I'll show you the schematic of
 

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:06.170
so first I'll show you the schematic of
how you make a motor and then I'll show

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:06.180
how you make a motor and then I'll show
 

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:09.860
how you make a motor and then I'll show
you a real one you take a carbon

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:09.870
you a real one you take a carbon
 

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:13.610
you a real one you take a carbon
nanotube in this case it's a it's a

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:13.620
nanotube in this case it's a it's a
 

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:16.490
nanotube in this case it's a it's a
multi wall - it's got two tubes and one

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:16.500
multi wall - it's got two tubes and one
 

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:18.800
multi wall - it's got two tubes and one
inside the other and you put it down on

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:18.810
inside the other and you put it down on
 

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:21.680
inside the other and you put it down on
the surface and the yellow is gold and

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:21.690
the surface and the yellow is gold and
 

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:23.810
the surface and the yellow is gold and
you configure it so it has a little

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:23.820
you configure it so it has a little
 

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:26.090
you configure it so it has a little
piece of gold on it and then these are

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:26.100
piece of gold on it and then these are
 

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:30.530
piece of gold on it and then these are
just electrodes and if you go inside and

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:30.540
just electrodes and if you go inside and
 

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:34.880
just electrodes and if you go inside and
look at what's happening inside the tube

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:34.890
look at what's happening inside the tube
 

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:37.670
look at what's happening inside the tube
you'll see that there's an outer tube

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:37.680
you'll see that there's an outer tube
 

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:41.240
you'll see that there's an outer tube
and then there's an inner tube and and

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:41.250
and then there's an inner tube and and
 

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:45.560
and then there's an inner tube and and
these tubes like to form in as by tubes

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:45.570
these tubes like to form in as by tubes
 

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:49.870
these tubes like to form in as by tubes
having two tubes and so you pulse this

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:49.880
having two tubes and so you pulse this
 

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:52.250
having two tubes and so you pulse this
gold piece of gold to make the thing

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:52.260
gold piece of gold to make the thing
 

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:56.840
gold piece of gold to make the thing
turn and you break these bonds so the

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:56.850
turn and you break these bonds so the
 

00:27:56.850 --> 00:28:00.080
turn and you break these bonds so the
outer tube moves around separately from

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:00.090
outer tube moves around separately from
 

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:02.390
outer tube moves around separately from
the inner tube and if you put on

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:02.400
the inner tube and if you put on
 

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:05.510
the inner tube and if you put on
electrical contacts by changing the

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:05.520
electrical contacts by changing the
 

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:06.710

you've actually made a motor and this is
 

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:15.050
you've actually made a motor and this is
what a real one looks like if you the

00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:15.060
what a real one looks like if you the
 

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:17.330
what a real one looks like if you the
tube is going up the center this was the

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:17.340
tube is going up the center this was the
 

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.190
tube is going up the center this was the
first one made some years ago and they

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200
first one made some years ago and they
 

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.620
first one made some years ago and they
now make them by the hundreds and so

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:21.630
now make them by the hundreds and so
 

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:23.240
now make them by the hundreds and so
there's a tube going down there this is

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:23.250
there's a tube going down there this is
 

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:25.310

another one by nitrogen and this is a

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:05.520
another one by nitrogen and this is a
 

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.240
another one by nitrogen and this is a
very very strong tube and it's a

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:08.250
very very strong tube and it's a
 

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:11.210
very very strong tube and it's a
semiconductor but you can dope it and

when you have these tubes and you dope

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:13.500
when you have these tubes and you dope
 

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.770
when you have these tubes and you dope
it the electrons go right down the

it the electrons go right down the
 

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:18.260
it the electrons go right down the
center of the two so you can build a

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:18.270
center of the two so you can build a
 

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:21.140
center of the two so you can build a
pipe for electrons and they can they've

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:21.150
pipe for electrons and they can they've
 

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:23.390

many applications I'll show you some
 

00:29:24.929 --> 00:29:27.890
many applications I'll show you some
applications in a moment but one of the

00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:27.900
applications in a moment but one of the
 

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:30.049
applications in a moment but one of the
things that's been a lot of fun and I'll

00:29:30.049 --> 00:29:30.059
things that's been a lot of fun and I'll
 

00:29:30.059 --> 00:29:32.600
things that's been a lot of fun and I'll
tell you why it's important a little bit

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:32.610
tell you why it's important a little bit
 

00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:35.840
tell you why it's important a little bit
later is that you can get these c60

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:35.850
later is that you can get these c60
 

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:39.500
later is that you can get these c60

now this is a multi wall - it's probably
 

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:44.780
now this is a multi wall - it's probably
got about six or eight walls so that's

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:44.790
got about six or eight walls so that's
 

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:46.100
got about six or eight walls so that's
why you're seeing a bunch of lines

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:46.110
why you're seeing a bunch of lines
 

00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:48.169
why you're seeing a bunch of lines
because you've seen cross-section and

00:29:48.169 --> 00:29:48.179
because you've seen cross-section and
 

00:29:48.179 --> 00:29:52.000
because you've seen cross-section and
these are c60 molecules lined up and

00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:59.000
depending on the diameter of the hole
you can get different configurations so

00:29:59.000 --> 00:29:59.010
you can get different configurations so
 

00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:01.100
you can get different configurations so
this is schematic for example if the

buckyball or these ball bearings are the
 

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:06.410
buckyball or these ball bearings are the
same size as the tube then they line up

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:06.420
same size as the tube then they line up
 

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:07.880
same size as the tube then they line up
like this if it's a little bit bigger

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:07.890
like this if it's a little bit bigger
 

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:09.650
like this if it's a little bit bigger
they start doing this and the

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:09.660
they start doing this and the

mathematicians have worked out all the
 

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.730
mathematicians have worked out all the
different structures you can get so

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:13.740
different structures you can get so
 

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:15.799
different structures you can get so
these are structures that are not in

00:30:15.799 --> 00:30:15.809
these are structures that are not in
 

00:30:15.809 --> 00:30:18.500
these are structures that are not in
nature but you can build them and you

won't go into details if you take an

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:01.800
won't go into details if you take an
 

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:05.600
won't go into details if you take an
ordinary electron and ask what its

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:05.610
ordinary electron and ask what its
 

00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:07.790
ordinary electron and ask what its
energy is as you increase its momentum

00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:07.800
energy is as you increase its momentum
 

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:10.840
energy is as you increase its momentum
the energy goes as the momentum squared

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:10.850
the energy goes as the momentum squared
 

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:14.510
the energy goes as the momentum squared
and the electrons in a metal the energy

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:14.520
and the electrons in a metal the energy
 

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:17.750
and the electrons in a metal the energy
goes this could be momentum K go as a

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760
goes this could be momentum K go as a
 

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.760
goes this could be momentum K go as a
square of the energy and then you fill

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:19.770
square of the energy and then you fill
 

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:22.120
square of the energy and then you fill
up all the electrons

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:22.130
up all the electrons
 

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:24.340
up all the electrons
something called a Fermi level and then

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:24.350
something called a Fermi level and then
 

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:25.870
something called a Fermi level and then
it's empty above and you excite

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:25.880
it's empty above and you excite
 

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.450
it's empty above and you excite
electrons from here to here you know

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:28.460
electrons from here to here you know
 

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:31.690
electrons from here to here you know
semiconductor is also quadratic it goes

00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:31.700
semiconductor is also quadratic it goes
 

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:33.880
semiconductor is also quadratic it goes
as the momentum squared and there's a

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:33.890
as the momentum squared and there's a
 

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:36.040
as the momentum squared and there's a
gap and you take electrons from here and

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:36.050
gap and you take electrons from here and
 

00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:37.960
gap and you take electrons from here and
you put in here and this is the gap that

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:37.970
you put in here and this is the gap that
 

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:39.700
you put in here and this is the gap that
silicon has that gives you the

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:39.710
silicon has that gives you the
 

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:42.730
silicon has that gives you the
photoelectric effect but for graphite or

00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:42.740
photoelectric effect but for graphite or
 

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:47.050
photoelectric effect but for graphite or
graphene there is no gap at zero and the

00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:47.060
graphene there is no gap at zero and the
 

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:51.460
graphene there is no gap at zero and the
energy is linear in the momentum and so

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:51.470
energy is linear in the momentum and so
 

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:53.590
energy is linear in the momentum and so
people have gone back they said the

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:53.600
people have gone back they said the
 

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:57.490
people have gone back they said the
physics is totally different but Dirac

00:33:57.490 --> 00:33:57.500
physics is totally different but Dirac
 

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:00.490
physics is totally different but Dirac
had an equation a relativistic equation

00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:00.500
had an equation a relativistic equation
 

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:02.770
had an equation a relativistic equation
for the energy as a function of the

00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:02.780
for the energy as a function of the
 

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:05.590
for the energy as a function of the
momentum and the mass so for example if

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:05.600
momentum and the mass so for example if
 

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.960
momentum and the mass so for example if
you had no momentum that East squared

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:07.970
you had no momentum that East squared
 

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:10.060
you had no momentum that East squared
would be M Squared C to the fourth so e

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:10.070
would be M Squared C to the fourth so e
 

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:11.560
would be M Squared C to the fourth so e
equals mc-squared

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:11.570
equals mc-squared
 

00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:14.980
equals mc-squared
but once you put momentum in for a

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:14.990
but once you put momentum in for a
 

00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:18.760
but once you put momentum in for a
massless particle ego's this pc so it

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:18.770
massless particle ego's this pc so it
 

00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:21.610
massless particle ego's this pc so it
goes linearly and this does an amazing

00:34:21.610 --> 00:34:21.620
goes linearly and this does an amazing
 

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:25.960
goes linearly and this does an amazing
amount of changes things considerably of

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:25.970
amount of changes things considerably of
 

00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:28.360
amount of changes things considerably of
course now it's not the velocity of

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:28.370
course now it's not the velocity of
 

00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:30.100
course now it's not the velocity of
light because this is in a solid and

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:30.110
light because this is in a solid and
 

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:32.290
light because this is in a solid and
it's the velocity of light over about

00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:32.300
it's the velocity of light over about
 

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:35.740
it's the velocity of light over about
300 so it's this funny property that

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:35.750
300 so it's this funny property that
 

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:37.780
300 so it's this funny property that
allows you to do strange things and I'm

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:37.790
allows you to do strange things and I'm
 

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:39.159
allows you to do strange things and I'm
just going to tell you two strange

00:34:39.159 --> 00:34:39.169
just going to tell you two strange
 

00:34:39.169 --> 00:34:43.389
just going to tell you two strange
things but I won't explain it all if you

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:43.399
things but I won't explain it all if you
 

00:34:43.399 --> 00:34:45.940
things but I won't explain it all if you
take a piece of graphite and you draw

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:45.950
take a piece of graphite and you draw
 

00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:48.340
take a piece of graphite and you draw
lines on it and it's possible to draw a

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:48.350
lines on it and it's possible to draw a
 

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:51.010
lines on it and it's possible to draw a
line perpendicular and then you shine

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:51.020
line perpendicular and then you shine
 

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:54.100
line perpendicular and then you shine
electrons no matter what angle they come

00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:54.110
electrons no matter what angle they come
 

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:57.250
electrons no matter what angle they come
in they go straight they don't go along

00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:57.260
in they go straight they don't go along
 

00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:59.620
in they go straight they don't go along
the lines but perpendicular lines they

00:34:59.620 --> 00:34:59.630
the lines but perpendicular lines they
 

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:02.080
the lines but perpendicular lines they
go straight so you can take a graphene

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:02.090
go straight so you can take a graphene
 

00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:05.910
go straight so you can take a graphene
sheet and culminate electrons and make

00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:05.920
sheet and culminate electrons and make
 

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:08.440
sheet and culminate electrons and make
let's say flat panel displays and all

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:08.450
let's say flat panel displays and all
 

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:11.710
let's say flat panel displays and all
the rest another strange thing because

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:11.720
the rest another strange thing because
 

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:13.600
the rest another strange thing because
of these special properties of graphene

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:13.610
of these special properties of graphene
 

00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:16.030
of these special properties of graphene
is if you cut a ribbon of it so these

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:16.040
is if you cut a ribbon of it so these
 

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:18.820
is if you cut a ribbon of it so these
are just carbon atoms hexade and then

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:18.830
are just carbon atoms hexade and then
 

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:22.360
are just carbon atoms hexade and then
the electrons have spin and because of

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:22.370
the electrons have spin and because of
 

00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:25.210
the electrons have spin and because of
the nature of graphene at one end the

00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:25.220
the nature of graphene at one end the
 

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:27.940
the nature of graphene at one end the
spins will all line up up at the other

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:27.950
spins will all line up up at the other
 

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:31.030
spins will all line up up at the other
one in the line up down and if you

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.040
one in the line up down and if you
 

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:33.850
one in the line up down and if you
usually you change the direction of the

00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:33.860
usually you change the direction of the
 

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:35.980
usually you change the direction of the
spin with a magnetic field but here

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:35.990
spin with a magnetic field but here
 

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:38.320
spin with a magnetic field but here
with an electric field you can get all

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:38.330
with an electric field you can get all
 

00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:40.599
with an electric field you can get all
the electrons lines straight up or all

00:35:40.599 --> 00:35:40.609
the electrons lines straight up or all
 

00:35:40.609 --> 00:35:42.640
the electrons lines straight up or all
the electrons line straight down so you

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:42.650
the electrons line straight down so you
 

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:45.339
the electrons line straight down so you
can polarize electrons and that's a very

00:35:45.339 --> 00:35:45.349
can polarize electrons and that's a very
 

00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:47.770
can polarize electrons and that's a very
important aspect so I just wanted to say

00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:47.780
important aspect so I just wanted to say
 

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:49.780
important aspect so I just wanted to say
that graphene is different and there's a

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:49.790
that graphene is different and there's a
 

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:52.630
that graphene is different and there's a
lot of reasons for studying it okay now

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:52.640
lot of reasons for studying it okay now
 

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:56.380
lot of reasons for studying it okay now
last topic is super conductivity it was

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:56.390
last topic is super conductivity it was
 

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:58.960
last topic is super conductivity it was
discovered in 1911 so last year was the

discovered in 1911 so last year was the
 

00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:00.460
discovered in 1911 so last year was the
hundredth year anniversary and we

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:00.470
hundredth year anniversary and we
 

00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:02.620
hundredth year anniversary and we
celebrated it all all around the world

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:02.630
celebrated it all all around the world
 

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:05.230
celebrated it all all around the world
and it was discovered by come early

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:05.240
and it was discovered by come early
 

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:09.460

illness in Leiden and there are many

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:09.470
illness in Leiden and there are many
 

00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:11.710
illness in Leiden and there are many
stories about whether he was around when

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:11.720
stories about whether he was around when
 

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:14.890
stories about whether he was around when
it was discovered because his students

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:14.900
it was discovered because his students
 

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:16.570
it was discovered because his students
were there in the lab and then tried to

00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:16.580
were there in the lab and then tried to
 

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:18.940
were there in the lab and then tried to
convince him that it was there but there

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:18.950
convince him that it was there but there
 

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:20.800
convince him that it was there but there
are many versions of this and it's

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:20.810
are many versions of this and it's
 

00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:23.950
are many versions of this and it's
discussed in physics today but basically

00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:23.960
discussed in physics today but basically
 

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:28.000
discussed in physics today but basically
he had liquefied helium which allows you

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:28.010
he had liquefied helium which allows you
 

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:31.180
he had liquefied helium which allows you
to go to temperatures down to around 4

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:31.190
to go to temperatures down to around 4
 

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:33.370

and they measured the resistance of

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:37.190
and they measured the resistance of
 

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:40.329
and they measured the resistance of
mercury and instead of it coming back to

00:36:40.329 --> 00:36:40.339
mercury and instead of it coming back to
 

00:36:40.339 --> 00:36:43.599
mercury and instead of it coming back to
a constant it went to zero really zero

00:36:43.599 --> 00:36:43.609
a constant it went to zero really zero
 

00:36:43.609 --> 00:36:45.940
a constant it went to zero really zero
and even in those days they could

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:45.950
and even in those days they could
 

00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:48.460
and even in those days they could
measure this to 10 to the minus 5 ohms

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:48.470
measure this to 10 to the minus 5 ohms
 

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:51.940
measure this to 10 to the minus 5 ohms
and found that it was zero so no

00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:51.950
and found that it was zero so no
 

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:54.700
and found that it was zero so no
resistance it flows without resistance

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:54.710

superconductors but one thing we know
and that is that like the class 1

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:47.330
and that is that like the class 1
 

00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:49.940
and that is that like the class 1
superconductors and that theory was

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:49.950
superconductors and that theory was
 

00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:51.740
superconductors and that theory was
explained by bardeen cooper and

00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:51.750
explained by bardeen cooper and
 

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:53.930

we know that the electrons are paired so

00:41:58.460 --> 00:41:58.470
we know that the electrons are paired so
 

00:41:58.470 --> 00:42:01.340
we know that the electrons are paired so
the question is why if you pair

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:01.350
the question is why if you pair
 

00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:04.520
the question is why if you pair
electrons will the electrons go through

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:04.530
electrons will the electrons go through
 

00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:08.140
electrons will the electrons go through
a wire and not lose energy why is that

00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:08.150
a wire and not lose energy why is that
 

00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:12.320
a wire and not lose energy why is that
superconducting and to explain this you

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:12.330
superconducting and to explain this you
 

00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:14.260
superconducting and to explain this you
think about going to a dance

00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:14.270
think about going to a dance
 

00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:16.570
think about going to a dance
and you and your partner are going to

00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:16.580
and you and your partner are going to
 

00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:19.150
and you and your partner are going to
dance about 15 feet apart from each

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:19.160
dance about 15 feet apart from each
 

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:21.850
dance about 15 feet apart from each
other long distance so there'll be other

00:42:21.850 --> 00:42:21.860
other long distance so there'll be other
 

00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:23.650
other long distance so there'll be other
couples between you and all the rest but

00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:23.660
couples between you and all the rest but
 

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:25.810
couples between you and all the rest but
you know who your partner is and

00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:25.820
you know who your partner is and
 

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:28.630
you know who your partner is and
whenever you move forward your partner

00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:28.640
whenever you move forward your partner
 

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.400
whenever you move forward your partner
moves forward you move back

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:30.410
moves forward you move back
 

00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:32.140
moves forward you move back
your partner moves back I mean that's

00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:32.150
your partner moves back I mean that's
 

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:34.390
your partner moves back I mean that's
the agreement and when you bump off

00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:34.400
the agreement and when you bump off
 

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.790
the agreement and when you bump off
something even though your partner

00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800
something even though your partner
 

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:38.830
something even though your partner
doesn't have something to bump off your

00:42:38.830 --> 00:42:38.840
doesn't have something to bump off your
 

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:42.670
doesn't have something to bump off your
partner bumps off the opposite way so as

00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:42.680
partner bumps off the opposite way so as
 

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:45.730
partner bumps off the opposite way so as
these electrons move no matter what

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:45.740
these electrons move no matter what
 

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:48.640
these electrons move no matter what
happens to them the partner if one loses

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:48.650
happens to them the partner if one loses
 

00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:51.670
happens to them the partner if one loses
momentum the partner picks it up and so

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:51.680
momentum the partner picks it up and so
 

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:54.490
momentum the partner picks it up and so
all you need to create super

00:42:54.490 --> 00:42:54.500
all you need to create super
 

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.620
all you need to create super

Schriever theory is for the electrons to

00:42:59.890 --> 00:42:59.900
Schriever theory is for the electrons to
 

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:03.180
Schriever theory is for the electrons to
match up to attract each other and

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:03.190
match up to attract each other and
 

00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:05.859
match up to attract each other and
electrons are negative so they repel

00:43:05.859 --> 00:43:05.869
electrons are negative so they repel
 

00:43:05.869 --> 00:43:08.440
electrons are negative so they repel
each other but it turns out in the

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:08.450

interacting with the c6 he's trying to
 

00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:26.820
interacting with the c6 he's trying to
get a higher transition temperature so

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:26.830
get a higher transition temperature so
 

00:47:26.830 --> 00:47:28.950
get a higher transition temperature so

00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:30.720
I'll just give you the bottom line on
the latest work I'm trying to get the

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:30.730
the latest work I'm trying to get the
 

00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:32.630
the latest work I'm trying to get the
high temperature superconductors I

00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640
high temperature superconductors I
 

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:34.650
high temperature superconductors I
mentioned that the transition

00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:34.660
mentioned that the transition
 

00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:36.150
mentioned that the transition
temperature goes like the square root of

00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:36.160
temperature goes like the square root of
 

00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:38.180
temperature goes like the square root of
this lambda parameter times the phonons

00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:38.190
this lambda parameter times the phonons
 

00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:42.210
this lambda parameter times the phonons
it turns out that that's the same as an

00:47:42.210 --> 00:47:42.220
it turns out that that's the same as an
 

00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:45.000
it turns out that that's the same as an
electronic spring constant that we can

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:45.010
electronic spring constant that we can
 

00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:48.180
electronic spring constant that we can
calculate it's very strong for strongly

00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:48.190
calculate it's very strong for strongly
 

00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:51.300
calculate it's very strong for strongly

the atom square root of this gives you

00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:54.520
the atom square root of this gives you
 

00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:56.880
the atom square root of this gives you
the transition temperature so we're

00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:56.890
the transition temperature so we're
 

00:47:56.890 --> 00:47:59.490
the transition temperature so we're
looking for things that have strong

00:47:59.490 --> 00:47:59.500
looking for things that have strong
 

00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:03.120
looking for things that have strong
bonds and like masses and that brings us

00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:03.130
bonds and like masses and that brings us
 

00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:06.240
bonds and like masses and that brings us
all the way back to diamond but diamond

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:06.250
all the way back to diamond but diamond
 

00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:08.670
all the way back to diamond but diamond
is an insulator so you have to get

00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:08.680
is an insulator so you have to get
 

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:10.590

00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:17.970
diamond and the first discovery is were
in the in Russia and they got it to 4

00:48:17.970 --> 00:48:17.980

there's a big effort trying to get

there's a big effort trying to get
 

00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:27.210
there's a big effort trying to get
higher and we can show that if you look

00:48:27.210 --> 00:48:27.220
higher and we can show that if you look
 

00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:29.100
higher and we can show that if you look
at the transition temperature this is an

00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:29.110
at the transition temperature this is an
 

00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:31.260
at the transition temperature this is an
old picture but it shows that the

00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:31.270
old picture but it shows that the
 

00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:33.030
old picture but it shows that the
transition temperature is functional and

00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.040
transition temperature is functional and
 

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:35.700
transition temperature is functional and

super conductivity in diamond could go
up even to room temperature but there's

up even to room temperature but there's
 

00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:51.060
up even to room temperature but there's
a problem when you make predictions as

00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:01.470
all of shenanigans we go through in
 

00:57:01.470 --> 00:57:03.800
all of shenanigans we go through in
terms of their shenanigans but there's

00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:03.810
terms of their shenanigans but there's
 

00:57:03.810 --> 00:57:05.570
terms of their shenanigans but there's
nothing you put in I mean there's no

00:57:05.570 --> 00:57:05.580
nothing you put in I mean there's no
 

00:57:05.580 --> 00:57:09.350
nothing you put in I mean there's no
input parameters but so the answer is we

00:57:09.350 --> 00:57:09.360
input parameters but so the answer is we
 

00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:11.690
input parameters but so the answer is we
don't use that but they're wonderful

00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:11.700
don't use that but they're wonderful
 

00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:28.849
don't use that but they're wonderful
methods and nowadays of both things work

00:57:28.849 --> 00:57:28.859
 

00:57:28.859 --> 00:57:31.700
this has nothing to do with relativity

00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:31.710
this has nothing to do with relativity
 

00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:35.700
this has nothing to do with relativity
it was basic it's basically an accident

00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:35.710
it was basic it's basically an accident
 

00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:40.370
it was basic it's basically an accident
of that you should put something like a

00:57:40.370 --> 00:57:40.380
of that you should put something like a
 

00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:47.839
of that you should put something like a
carbon atom in a sp2 orbital and make a

00:57:47.839 --> 00:57:47.849
carbon atom in a sp2 orbital and make a
 

00:57:47.849 --> 00:57:50.549
carbon atom in a sp2 orbital and make a
graphene or graphite then the

00:57:50.549 --> 00:57:50.559
graphene or graphite then the
 

00:57:50.559 --> 00:57:53.940
graphene or graphite then the
calculations come out like this and it

00:57:53.940 --> 00:57:53.950
calculations come out like this and it
 

00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:58.579
calculations come out like this and it
was done in the early 1940s calculation

00:57:58.579 --> 00:57:58.589
was done in the early 1940s calculation
 

00:57:58.589 --> 00:58:02.069
was done in the early 1940s calculation
at the Gila University by a theoretical

00:58:02.069 --> 00:58:02.079
at the Gila University by a theoretical
 

00:58:02.079 --> 00:58:04.289
at the Gila University by a theoretical
physicist who certainly would have

00:58:04.289 --> 00:58:04.299
physicist who certainly would have
 

00:58:04.299 --> 00:58:05.910
physicist who certainly would have
shared the Nobel Prize with these people

00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:05.920
shared the Nobel Prize with these people
 

00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:09.510
shared the Nobel Prize with these people
he had live because he had that I knew

00:58:09.510 --> 00:58:09.520
he had live because he had that I knew
 

00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:12.180
he had live because he had that I knew
about it as a graduate student you know

00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:12.190
about it as a graduate student you know
 

00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:14.819
about it as a graduate student you know
so what we were talking about this

00:58:14.819 --> 00:58:14.829
so what we were talking about this
 

00:58:14.829 --> 00:58:18.599
so what we were talking about this
afternoon about Exxon Laboratory when

00:58:18.599 --> 00:58:18.609
afternoon about Exxon Laboratory when
 

00:58:18.609 --> 00:58:21.510
afternoon about Exxon Laboratory when
someone took me in and showed me carbon

00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:21.520
someone took me in and showed me carbon
 

00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:23.460
someone took me in and showed me carbon
clusters and said look there's a lot of

00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:23.470
clusters and said look there's a lot of
 

00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:28.289
clusters and said look there's a lot of
them at 66 you while I was doing this

00:58:28.289 --> 00:58:28.299
them at 66 you while I was doing this
 

00:58:28.299 --> 00:58:29.579
them at 66 you while I was doing this
someone said let's go to lunch

00:58:29.579 --> 00:58:29.589
someone said let's go to lunch
 

00:58:29.589 --> 00:58:32.519
someone said let's go to lunch
and there was the buckyball I mean these

00:58:32.519 --> 00:58:32.529
and there was the buckyball I mean these
 

00:58:32.529 --> 00:58:33.539
and there was the buckyball I mean these
things happen

00:58:33.539 --> 00:58:33.549
things happen
 

00:58:33.549 --> 00:58:38.039
things happen
so here this man actually predicted that

00:58:38.039 --> 00:58:38.049
so here this man actually predicted that
 

00:58:38.049 --> 00:58:40.349
so here this man actually predicted that
you would have a spectrum that's linear

00:58:40.349 --> 00:58:40.359
you would have a spectrum that's linear
 

00:58:40.359 --> 00:58:43.140
you would have a spectrum that's linear
and it's not relativistic it just looks

00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:43.150
and it's not relativistic it just looks
 

00:58:43.150 --> 00:58:45.690
and it's not relativistic it just looks
the same thing just taking the same so

00:58:45.690 --> 00:58:45.700
the same thing just taking the same so
 

00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:47.819
the same thing just taking the same so
now people in particle physics are

00:58:47.819 --> 00:58:47.829
now people in particle physics are
 

00:58:47.829 --> 00:58:50.640
now people in particle physics are
applying their methods to graphene

00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:50.650
applying their methods to graphene
 

00:58:50.650 --> 00:58:52.319
applying their methods to graphene
because the dispersion relation is the

00:58:52.319 --> 00:58:52.329
because the dispersion relation is the
 

00:58:52.329 --> 00:58:54.059
because the dispersion relation is the
same but the physics is totally

00:58:54.059 --> 00:58:54.069
same but the physics is totally
 

00:58:54.069 --> 00:58:56.250
same but the physics is totally
different this is not a relativistic

00:58:56.250 --> 00:58:56.260
different this is not a relativistic
 

00:58:56.260 --> 00:59:02.180
different this is not a relativistic
calculation

00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:02.190
 

00:59:02.190 --> 00:59:05.369
thank you
