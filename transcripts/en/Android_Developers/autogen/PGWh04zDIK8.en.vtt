score tag this is basically a 64 or up

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319
score tag this is basically a 64 or up
 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.300
score tag this is basically a 64 or up
to 64 character URI safe string that you

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310
to 64 character URI safe string that you
 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.940
to 64 character URI safe string that you
can submit along with any score that you

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950
can submit along with any score that you
 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.190
can submit along with any score that you
send down to our service in case you're

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200
send down to our service in case you're
 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.800
send down to our service in case you're
wondering what URI safe is I went and

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810
wondering what URI safe is I went and
 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.229
wondering what URI safe is I went and
looked up the RFC and basically it's its

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239
looked up the RFC and basically it's its
 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.869
looked up the RFC and basically it's its
Alpha characters digits and like you

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879
Alpha characters digits and like you
 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.670
Alpha characters digits and like you
know four different punctuation marks

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680
know four different punctuation marks
 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.789
know four different punctuation marks
and you can basically create any kind of

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799
and you can basically create any kind of
 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.920
and you can basically create any kind of
string you want and send that down with

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930
string you want and send that down with
 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.349
string you want and send that down with
your score data to our servers and why

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:47.359
your score data to our servers and why
 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:49.000
your score data to our servers and why
would you want to do that well there's a

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010
would you want to do that well there's a
 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.030
would you want to do that well there's a
number of reasons partly you might want

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040
number of reasons partly you might want
 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.129
number of reasons partly you might want
to use it for metrics you know maybe

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:54.139
to use it for metrics you know maybe
 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:55.990
to use it for metrics you know maybe
you're just are kind of curious as to

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000
you're just are kind of curious as to
 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.030
you're just are kind of curious as to
how people are achieving these high

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040
how people are achieving these high
 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.979
how people are achieving these high
scores and so you might find out you

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989
scores and so you might find out you
 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.479
scores and so you might find out you
know what level they are playing at or

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489
know what level they are playing at or
 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.640
know what level they are playing at or
what power-ups they were using or what

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650
what power-ups they were using or what
 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.770
what power-ups they were using or what
boosts they you know had enabled when

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780
boosts they you know had enabled when
 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.929
boosts they you know had enabled when
they managed to you know receive this

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:07.939
they managed to you know receive this
 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:09.909
they managed to you know receive this
really high score and so you can submit

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:09.919
really high score and so you can submit
 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:11.619
really high score and so you can submit
that along with the with a score and

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629
that along with the with a score and
 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.199
that along with the with a score and
analyze that later if you as a developer

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209
analyze that later if you as a developer
 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.420
analyze that later if you as a developer
just do a score dot list on your public

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430
just do a score dot list on your public
 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.309
just do a score dot list on your public
leaderboards you'll be able to get the

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319
leaderboards you'll be able to get the
 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.229
leaderboards you'll be able to get the
score tag information along with the

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239
score tag information along with the
 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.330
score tag information along with the
scores that get sent down you could use

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340
scores that get sent down you could use
 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.490
scores that get sent down you could use
it to create a hash you know think about

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500
it to create a hash you know think about
 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.280
it to create a hash you know think about
if you take that score maybe add on you

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290
if you take that score maybe add on you
 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.199
if you take that score maybe add on you
know some other kind of string that's

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209
know some other kind of string that's
 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.420
know some other kind of string that's
semi secret it'll be on the client so it

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430
semi secret it'll be on the client so it
 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.129
semi secret it'll be on the client so it
won't be completely secret but hard to

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139
won't be completely secret but hard to
 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:35.949
won't be completely secret but hard to
dig up create a hash on that you can

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959
dig up create a hash on that you can
 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.750
dig up create a hash on that you can
then use that as sort of a nice way to

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760
then use that as sort of a nice way to
 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.240
then use that as sort of a nice way to
verify that the score that that is being

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250
verify that the score that that is being
 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.099
verify that the score that that is being
sent is legitimate

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109
sent is legitimate
 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:45.159
sent is legitimate
you could also link to a database entry

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.169
you could also link to a database entry
 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:48.270
you could also link to a database entry
if say you've got a game that is

this way you know let's say you use that

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410
this way you know let's say you use that
 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.830
this way you know let's say you use that
hash implementation that we talked about

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840
hash implementation that we talked about
 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.240
hash implementation that we talked about
in the previous slide right you create a

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250
in the previous slide right you create a
 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.999
in the previous slide right you create a
hash of the user score before it gets

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:19.009
hash of the user score before it gets
 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:21.790
hash of the user score before it gets
sent down to our service then what you

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800
sent down to our service then what you
 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.420
sent down to our service then what you
can do on your own on your side is you

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430
can do on your own on your side is you
 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.100
can do on your own on your side is you
know you can call it scores that list

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110
know you can call it scores that list
 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.560
know you can call it scores that list
which will get a entire list of the user

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570
which will get a entire list of the user
 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.870
which will get a entire list of the user
scores along with all the score tags

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880
scores along with all the score tags
 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.089
scores along with all the score tags
iterate through those and check out

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.099
iterate through those and check out
 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:36.159
iterate through those and check out
those tags right generate your hash on

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:36.169
those tags right generate your hash on
 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.379
those tags right generate your hash on
your side see if that equals the hash

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:38.389
your side see if that equals the hash
 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:41.260
your side see if that equals the hash
that you see in the score tag and if it

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270
that you see in the score tag and if it
 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.430
that you see in the score tag and if it
doesn't match if something looks

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440
doesn't match if something looks

developers would rather keep track of
 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.330
developers would rather keep track of
that information on the client and so we

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:58.340
that information on the client and so we
 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.060
that information on the client and so we
have added this call it's the second

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:01.070
have added this call it's the second
 

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.280
have added this call it's the second
steps call that basically lets you

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:03.290
steps call that basically lets you
 

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.530

achievement so you would say okay the

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:10.940
achievement so you would say okay the
 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.270
achievement so you would say okay the
user has you know blasted a total of two

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:13.280
user has you know blasted a total of two
 

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.130
user has you know blasted a total of two
spaceships and then they have lasted a

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:15.140
spaceships and then they have lasted a
 

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.500
spaceships and then they have lasted a
total of seven and fifteen and so on

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:17.510
total of seven and fifteen and so on
 

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.420
total of seven and fifteen and so on
you'll notice in that last row they're

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:19.430
you'll notice in that last row they're
 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.920
you'll notice in that last row they're
in the in the table we the we submit 18

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:23.930
in the in the table we the we submit 18
 

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.490
in the in the table we the we submit 18
and the service keeps the last entry of

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:27.500
and the service keeps the last entry of
 

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.730
and the service keeps the last entry of
twenty basically if you submit a number

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:30.740
twenty basically if you submit a number
 

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.610
twenty basically if you submit a number
that is less than the progress that the

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:33.620
that is less than the progress that the
 

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.860
that is less than the progress that the
that we've already recorded that will

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:35.870
that we've already recorded that will
 

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.800
that we've already recorded that will
not go down so it will basically be kind

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:38.810
not go down so it will basically be kind
 

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.710
not go down so it will basically be kind
of you can never lose progress by by

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:41.720
of you can never lose progress by by
 

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.440
of you can never lose progress by by
calling a set achievement steps call so

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:44.450
calling a set achievement steps call so
 

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:47.020
calling a set achievement steps call so
this is useful one if if you do want to

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:47.030
this is useful one if if you do want to
 

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:48.490
this is useful one if if you do want to
have your client be the main source of

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:48.500
have your client be the main source of
 

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.320
have your client be the main source of
truth for incremental achievements it's

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:50.330
truth for incremental achievements it's
 

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:51.910
truth for incremental achievements it's
also very useful for kind of sinking

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:51.920
also very useful for kind of sinking
 

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.280
also very useful for kind of sinking
achievement progress right like if a

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:54.290
achievement progress right like if a
 

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:56.920
achievement progress right like if a
user is signed into services but they

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:56.930
user is signed into services but they
 

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:58.690
user is signed into services but they
have been playing on your game for a

00:07:58.690 --> 00:07:58.700
have been playing on your game for a
 

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.340
have been playing on your game for a
while already and you're not quite sure

while already and you're not quite sure
 

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:02.140
while already and you're not quite sure
how to sync up their progress between

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:02.150
how to sync up their progress between
 

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:03.940
how to sync up their progress between
anything you've recorded locally and

what's already on the service this is a

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:06.110
what's already on the service this is a
 

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:07.960
what's already on the service this is a
cheap and easy way to do it you just say

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:07.970
cheap and easy way to do it you just say
 

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:09.550
cheap and easy way to do it you just say
okay you know what I'm going to trust my

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:09.560
okay you know what I'm going to trust my
 

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.920

blasted forty three spaceships on the

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:15.050
blasted forty three spaceships on the
 

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.360
blasted forty three spaceships on the
client I'll just send that down to the

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:16.370
client I'll just send that down to the
 

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.910
client I'll just send that down to the
server and that will you know make sure

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:18.920
server and that will you know make sure
 

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.770
server and that will you know make sure
that that the server is now in sync with

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:20.780
that that the server is now in sync with
