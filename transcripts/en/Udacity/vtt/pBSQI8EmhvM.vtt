00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.070
So, we've been looking at lots of different plots of the same data, and talking

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.140
about some of the trade-offs that are involved

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.070
in data visualization. So, which plot should you

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.960
choose? One important answer is that you

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.930
don't have to choose. In exploratory data analysis,

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.410
we'll often create multiple visualizations and summaries of

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.750
the same data, gleaning different incites from each.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.740
So, through out the course, as we iteratively

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.480
refine a particular plot of the same data, it's

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.490
not that the later versions are always better

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.980
than the previous versions. Sometimes they are. But, sometimes

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.200
they're just revealing different things about the same

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.290
data. Now, when it comes time to share your

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.700
work with a larger audience, you may need

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.060
to choose one or two visualizations that best communicate,

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.650
the main findings of your work.
