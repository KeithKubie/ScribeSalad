1
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:06,440
Uh, hello. Hello. Oh, all of that.

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,660
How are you? Oh my God. And Great.

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:12,503
What did I do?

4
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,890
Literally talking to another
world. I'm Jad. I am Robert.

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:19,250
This is Radiolab and today we are
reconnecting with an old producer of ours.

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,250
Brenna feral. Yeah. Past life.
Yeah. Ooh. Since leaving Radiolab,

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:27,800
she's been busy with work,
but also raising two kids
is crazy hard with family.

8
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:32,260
Just trying to like take my vitamins and
like exist on a low grade panic attack

9
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,140
all day. Well I guess we should start by,

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,310
let's just try and recall
like what it was. That's,

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,450
I don't even know how you
bumped in. You don't normally,

12
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,480
okay. So back in 2015, my husband,

13
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:50,481
nick and I were in our tiny apartment
back in Brooklyn and we were new parents.

14
00:00:50,971 --> 00:00:55,620
Our Son Marty was 18 months old
at the time and one morning,

15
00:00:55,621 --> 00:00:59,340
I think it was about 5:00 AM like still
dark. Marty woke up and he was just,

16
00:00:59,341 --> 00:01:02,280
you know, crying, crying, crying.
And so I tapped my husband.

17
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:05,790
It was his turn to get up early and
go get Marty. So he got out of bed.

18
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,440
I fell right back to sleep and
the next thing I knew, I was like,

19
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,520
felt somebody tapping me and I sort of
rolled over in my bed and there was just

20
00:01:14,521 --> 00:01:19,521
this little person looking up at me
covered at this greasy stuff all over.

21
00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:24,591
His face was shiny and he was laughing
and he held up in his hand this giant jar

22
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,180
of diaper ointment,

23
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,190
the special medicated stuff that
we had bought just that last week.

24
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,960
And I just thought, oh my God,

25
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,550
he just ate all this medicine and
I have no idea how much he ate.

26
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,210
And I look around at my husband who had
gotten up with him, changed his diaper,

27
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:45,450
and they put them down on the floor
to play head because he was exhausted

28
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:46,643
falling asleep in the chair right

29
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,613
while watching him.

30
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:52,570
So I just flung myself to the end of the
bed and I grabbed Marty in one arm and

31
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,910
started frantically searching the label,

32
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,690
which was filled with words
like petrolatum, Sarasin,

33
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,750
panthenol glycerin is a Bolo.

34
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,860
The Brenda says she didn't register any
of those words because right underneath

35
00:02:05,861 --> 00:02:10,000
that list of ingredients I just
saw this bold type that said a if

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,510
swallowed, call your doctor or
poison control center immediately.

37
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:17,410
[inaudible]

38
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,750
and so I'm clutching my son
and I'm clutching his jar.

39
00:02:19,751 --> 00:02:22,240
And then I yelled to my husband
to wake him up and I'm like,

40
00:02:22,241 --> 00:02:26,020
I need you to find the number and call
poison control while I hold Marty.

41
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,120
And so nick snaps into action,

42
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,470
leaps off the chair into the other room
so he can make the call and Brenna is

43
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,500
left sitting there in the bed holding her
18 month old son who is about to throw

44
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,940
up, pass out, die.

45
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,030
She's not sure like have you ever felt
that hollow feeling where you're like

46
00:02:43,031 --> 00:02:47,410
your whole chest just drops
and you just, it's like,

47
00:02:47,411 --> 00:02:51,580
it feels like missing a step.
You're like, he's just utterly sick.

48
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,980
And then just like all
sweaty up in my temple.

49
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,020
So I'm sitting on the edge of our bed,

50
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,960
Marty's in my lap and I'm eagle eye
watching for like whatever's about to

51
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,003
happening to him.

52
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,060
And I had always heard that like you
have your mother's instinct or whatever

53
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:04,451
that is,

54
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:07,510
and like moms know best and moms can tell
when something's wrong with their kid

55
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:10,000
and like sometimes, maybe that's true,

56
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:12,820
but for me Brenda says she just froze.

57
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:14,180
Wow.

58
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,830
I was imagining like this huge like
glop of ointment has worked its way down

59
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:22,060
your esophagus and now what is it doing
to your stomach lining and what's going

60
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:24,680
to happen when it had like, I was
just like, I can't take it back.

61
00:03:24,681 --> 00:03:25,514
Like what do I do?

62
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,520
So nick has gone to the next room and I
hear that he's on the phone with someone

63
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:36,260
and then just moments later
he came back out and he said,

64
00:03:36,261 --> 00:03:40,650
well, that was the most pleasant
phone call I've had in ages.

65
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:49,590
[inaudible]

66
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,690
there he was completely calm,

67
00:03:51,691 --> 00:03:55,350
kind of like smiling at me in the doorway
and I'm just still hunched over the

68
00:03:55,351 --> 00:03:59,010
bed, like hanging on to Marty
thinking what is going on?

69
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:05,090
So nick straightened up and then went
into like, oh, okay, here's what happened.

70
00:04:05,091 --> 00:04:08,930
I called, they immediately picked up
and then it says that Nick told her,

71
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,060
you talked to this man, the guy asked him,

72
00:04:11,061 --> 00:04:13,040
super matter of fact
how much Marty weighed.

73
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,340
Nick told him that 20
pounds or whatever. Yes.

74
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:19,300
Then what brand of diaper ointment did
Marty eat? They told him the brand. Yeah.

75
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,260
And then the guy did a
little mental math and said,

76
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,210
your child's going to
be fine. Totally fine.

77
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:28,290
Those was probably not a big deal at all.
It was really common. No vomiting, no,

78
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,570
no, nothing. Nope. He was like,

79
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:34,770
just like a slippery little piglet at
that point. So cleaned him up and then,

80
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,000
uh, you know, let him play

81
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:38,700
[inaudible]

82
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,710
but for the rest of the
day I just kept thinking,

83
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,140
what the Hell is poison control?

84
00:04:43,141 --> 00:04:46,110
I honestly didn't think we still lived
in a world where you could just call a

85
00:04:46,111 --> 00:04:46,681
hotline,

86
00:04:46,681 --> 00:04:50,310
like get on the telephone and talk to a
live human who somehow knows everything

87
00:04:50,311 --> 00:04:53,610
about this one specific brand of
diaper ointment. And then Bam,

88
00:04:53,611 --> 00:04:57,630
like 45 seconds later, this full
blown crisis in my mind was just gone.

89
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,400
And then I, you know, I just was
having this weird moment of like,

90
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:07,380
there's this invisible network out
there that was just kind of primed and

91
00:05:07,381 --> 00:05:11,490
waiting to help, um, who are these people?

92
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,130
So a few months later,

93
00:05:16,131 --> 00:05:19,590
I'm totally obsessed with poison
control. Let me check, check, check.

94
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:24,680
And I ended up in a skyscraper in downtown
Chicago up 19 floors down these four

95
00:05:24,681 --> 00:05:29,681
twisty turny corridors to the oldest
poison control center in America are here.

96
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,150
Tony, when it got there, you know, our
staff for service of natural light,

97
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,510
Carol, the senior director,

98
00:05:35,511 --> 00:05:39,380
it took me on a tour a lot smaller than
I would have expected even though it's

99
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:43,220
not a dome, but it definitely is
an office was uh, I, you know,

100
00:05:43,221 --> 00:05:47,870
I think I was expecting like just banks
of like high tech gleaming computers and

101
00:05:47,871 --> 00:05:51,080
instead that phone hasn't worked in at
least five years, but it's still there.

102
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:55,400
It was this narrow
office with Greg carpet.

103
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,210
You have a crusty mushroom up there, great

104
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,380
cubicles. I don't know who's cubs hat
that is, but it's been here for a while.

105
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:04,430
At least. Kind of reminded me of like a
basement college computer lab, you know,

106
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:07,430
like where all the machines are kind of
still running windows 95 or something

107
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:11,650
like that and sitting in front of those
computers or the poisoned specialists.

108
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,800
Um, I'm, I'm the steak bite person.
I love paneling steak by calls.

109
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,370
Here's Aaron who's in snakes,

110
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:19,430
like the little old lady who's like
working in her backyard and there was a

111
00:06:19,431 --> 00:06:22,730
snake and she chops off his head with a
shovel and then she brings a snake head

112
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:25,010
into the Er to show them what
bitter. And there's Connie,

113
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,710
I'm sort of the go to person
for mushrooms. How I look at it.

114
00:06:27,711 --> 00:06:31,130
She takes us room calls even when
she's on vacation. Is that true? Yes.

115
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,940
And she gets excited about it. There's
Cindy who used to work in the Er.

116
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,930
I'm a nurse by background is Jessica,
take the home calls, there's art,

117
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,250
all of it. It's all fun. And
then Brian is here. There's Tony,

118
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,360
he's the expert in everything

119
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,780
Illinois poison center. And while
I was there, the stream of calls,

120
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:57,350
it was just nonstop. If I buy, as
soon as one of them would hang up,

121
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:59,270
the phone was in the
center, Illinois poisons,

122
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,780
another call would come in
and five normally healthy.

123
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,490
Okay,

124
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:10,750
gently wipe off his lips with
little warm water on a washcloth,

125
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,470
give him something to drink. They all
told me that in order to work here,

126
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,470
you need a background in medicine,
special training and toxicology.

127
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:21,510
On top of that, it helps to have a good
memory, good math skills, but you know,

128
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,520
more importantly what you really
need is to be able to stay calm,

129
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,813
calm.

130
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,750
I usually tell people they're going to
be overwhelmed by the first three months

131
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,210
was in center because
sometimes the calls, you know,

132
00:07:34,211 --> 00:07:37,450
glow stick is not going to be
a problem. They're adorable,

133
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:42,580
but other times, boy, they're like this.

134
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:47,230
He has a temperature of 104 this
is an er call is a sugar. Again,

135
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,250
the hospital was calling about a male
patient who had been found unconscious,

136
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,030
completely sweaty, diaphoretic at
home, so the medics are assessing him.

137
00:07:55,031 --> 00:08:00,031
His blood sugar was 40 is
Tylenol is three 72 his pupils,

138
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,530
she said are bouncing all over the
place. I don't know what that is.

139
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,260
After she hung up, I asked Cindy
if this was a self harm call.

140
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:11,070
It's believed to be yes. She was saying
that his wife just died of cancer.

141
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,600
Yeah. Is that somewhat rare to get
one that serious? No, not at all.

142
00:08:15,601 --> 00:08:17,670
We get them all the time. At least

143
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,573
[inaudible] center.

144
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,580
Can you spell that?

145
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:29,450
Can you spell the name of that drug
and how many milligrams did you say?

146
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:34,520
I ended up spending about 12 hours there
that day and if you sit in a poison

147
00:08:34,521 --> 00:08:38,270
control center that long,
you just poison center.

148
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:39,770
These calls are washing over you.

149
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,570
They're just coming and
coming and coming and center.

150
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:46,370
You start to feel just kind of overwhelmed
by the fact that every single time

151
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,270
the phone rings,

152
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:51,080
there's somebody on the other side of
the line and they're in a moment of

153
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:55,320
uncertainty or panic. When did she
take the Tylenol overdose crisis?

154
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,100
This could be pretty

155
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,280
serious and the scale of that
is just kind of shocking.

156
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:03,360
We manage 80,000 calls a year out of
this room and that's just this one center

157
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:07,680
that's just Chicago. If you take the
poison centers all across the country,

158
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,810
they handle almost 3 million cases a year,

159
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:15,090
so you get a call like mine or much
worse about every 14 seconds or so.

160
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,330
You know,

161
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:27,010
this is a very poisonous planet and
thinking about just how many of us are

162
00:09:27,011 --> 00:09:29,680
bumping into these things that
we think might be poisoning us,

163
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,510
snuck mercury that are poisoning us.
Gold is poisonous to some extent.

164
00:09:34,511 --> 00:09:36,970
Silver, not so poisonous,
but it'll turn you blue.

165
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,590
I decided to call up Debra [inaudible],

166
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,240
director of the Knight Science Journalism
Program at MIT and poison enthusiast.

167
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:48,280
I love poison. It's true. I even wrote
a book called the Poisoner's Handbook.

168
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:51,550
You're my husband worries
about that a lot. In fact,

169
00:09:51,551 --> 00:09:55,450
he has not let me pour him a cup of coffee
for the last six years since my book

170
00:09:55,451 --> 00:09:59,410
came out. Very serious. He really
was. Seriously, he's always like, oh,

171
00:09:59,411 --> 00:09:59,981
I'll get it.

172
00:09:59,981 --> 00:10:04,270
So never says it helps to kind of think
of poison control as part of this much

173
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:08,800
larger back and forth kind of a dance
and evolving dance that we've been doing

174
00:10:08,801 --> 00:10:11,260
with our poisonous planet
for thousands of years.

175
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:15,970
We've been dancing with them in
different ways for a very long time.

176
00:10:15,971 --> 00:10:19,690
If you go back and look at
the hieroglyphics in Egypt,

177
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:25,080
there's actually references to death
by peach and that refers to cyanide

178
00:10:25,241 --> 00:10:29,750
poisoning because cyanides are the primary
poison than the pits of peaches and

179
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,880
flying peaches actually written in a
wall of a temple somewhere or that's

180
00:10:33,881 --> 00:10:37,870
exactly right. Endeavor says, if you
go back to the beginning of that dance,

181
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,030
you'll find that like with so many things,

182
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:45,090
it starts with murder because we humans
first got really interested in poisons

183
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,890
when we realized we could
use them to kill each other,

184
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:51,480
and one of my favorite
examples is actually our snack,

185
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,730
which in early 19th century
Europe was by all accounts,

186
00:10:54,731 --> 00:10:58,210
the perfect comma to Seidel poison.
It was tasteless. It was odorless.

187
00:10:58,211 --> 00:11:02,880
You could put it into vanilla pudding or
oatmeal mimic the natural illness. Gee,

188
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,130
Connell looked like they
had a bad gastroenteritis.

189
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,800
And at the time we had
no way of detecting it.

190
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,020
Literally when we come
into the 19th century,

191
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:15,670
science has not figured out a way to
detect a single poison in a corpse.

192
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:18,370
We'll so what ruined this
perfect murder? Well,

193
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:23,380
there was a chemist in Breton named James
Marsh who worked out this incredibly,

194
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:27,130
it's, I mean by just standards
today, primitive test,

195
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:32,370
which involved mincing up the tissue
from the dead person and adding some acid

196
00:11:32,681 --> 00:11:37,570
and heating it up and distilling it.
And then as this vapor comes out,

197
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,630
it cool onto glass.

198
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,050
And if there was any arsenic
in the original tissue,

199
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:49,680
that arsenic forms tiny dark crystals
and you've got a sort of blackish silver

200
00:11:50,321 --> 00:11:52,450
mirror forming over the glass.

201
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:58,650
And that was actually
the first great test in,

202
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,950
uh, forensic toxicology, the marsh test.

203
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:07,060
This is sort of the moment Deborah says
that modern science joins our dance with

204
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:12,061
poison because as you see the rise of
industrial chemistry and and our ability

205
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:17,080
to synthesize cyanide and strychnine and
some of these amazingly toxic elements,

206
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:20,980
you also see people's realization
of how useful they are.

207
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,820
Man, people are so cool around
here. Where are we in Soho?

208
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,860
We're in West Soho, West Soho.

209
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,710
What started happening was at the
beginning of the 20th century,

210
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,620
there were all these new cleaning products
hitting the market designed to kill

211
00:12:33,621 --> 00:12:37,880
germs and pharmaceutical products
designed to kill headaches or whatever,

212
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,690
and suddenly all these poisons that
used to just be out there in nature.

213
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,170
We're in our homes or in
the drugstore for example.

214
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,170
You see it's fun sunglasses
there. Here are producers,

215
00:12:48,171 --> 00:12:50,690
any mcewen and McKelvy
ticking a jaunt. Okay,

216
00:12:50,691 --> 00:12:55,340
here we are in Hudson pharmacy
on our time on Tuesday afternoon.

217
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:58,250
This is during working hours and
they only got the weird devito.

218
00:12:58,251 --> 00:13:02,300
Flavors come in to the local
drug store cleaning aisle. Wow.

219
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,840
So draino bottom of the
shelf, easy for kids to reach.

220
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,990
Now let's read the ingredients
contain sodium hypochlorite,

221
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:16,520
sodium hydroxide, and sodium silicate.
Okay, let me see. One second.

222
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,330
Quick check. Online sodium
hydroxide. According to Wikipedia,

223
00:13:20,331 --> 00:13:24,200
it's used to digest tissues. Say
there's like roadkill in a landfill.

224
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,860
They hope put the roadkill in a sealed
container with sodium hydroxide and

225
00:13:27,861 --> 00:13:29,770
water. It's like breaking bad. Yeah,

226
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,370
and the body turns into a liquid with
coffee, like appearance. Apparently.

227
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:38,660
It's like turns people into coffee.
Yeah, little higher on the shelf.

228
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:42,690
Everybody's favorite childhood
cartoon, Mr. Clean Meadows and rains.

229
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:47,630
Then same thing. Sodium hydroxide coffee.
People don't open it. Don't open it.

230
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:50,090
It's not as if, okay,
I have to buy it. No,

231
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:57,440
look as I, what's this thing? This will
amounts. There's Windex, Windex, oh,

232
00:13:57,441 --> 00:14:01,580
this one is just called ammonia.
If you mix ammonia and bleach,

233
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:02,690
what happens?

234
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:08,750
A poisonous gas results also occurs
naturally in the atmosphere of Jupiter and

235
00:14:08,751 --> 00:14:10,700
Saturn. That's impressive. Next one,

236
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,950
this little gray bottle
up on the highest shelf.

237
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,990
Goodall's brush and Kapa Polish,

238
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:19,280
a brass and copper Polish and
contains to detoxy ethanol.

239
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:23,830
It has a sweet ether like
odor and I'm going to, Oh,

240
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:28,110
you just open it and smell it.
Oh, it said harmful, if any. Okay.

241
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:31,070
Well it says it can cause
adrenal tumors in animals.

242
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,990
It's carcinogenic and rodents.

243
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:39,650
I hope I didn't smell too much of
it. Matt. Let's just get out of here.

244
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,920
You don't want to get
some chips. All right.

245
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:48,140
We're very comfortable with the fact that
we walked down the grocery store aisle

246
00:14:48,141 --> 00:14:52,190
or open up the medicine chest and
we're surrounded by these, you

247
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,130
know, in pill form or liquid
form or spray form or whatever,

248
00:14:55,131 --> 00:14:59,180
but these different compounds
that actually are dangerous.
We're used to that.

249
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:03,740
We live with that. Right?
Snakes, which brings us to a guy.

250
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,040
Let's see. Oh, and I use a
plaque for Lewis. Good. Actually,

251
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:11,260
I saw this plaque dedicated to him on
the wall at the poison center in Chicago,

252
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:15,800
appreciation of the initiative and
devoted service of Louis Godalming RPH,

253
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,360
founder of the poison and drug
information center. Anyway,

254
00:15:18,361 --> 00:15:20,020
a guy named Louis [inaudible],

255
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:25,160
Louis Scotoma and who is a brilliant
scientists in the state of Illinois.

256
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,730
Louis passed away back in 1995
but his wife Catherine, yes,

257
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,000
it's still very much alive.
Absolutely. She's 98 now,

258
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:35,390
but she met Louis back when she was a
20 year old nurse working in the Saint

259
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,590
Luke's hospital in Chicago.

260
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:41,770
It was 1948 and he was a pharmacist in
the hospital and everybody knew Lou and

261
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,260
we all loved him. And I was
the lucky one. I caught him.

262
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,980
Louis was sort of a shorter man,
dark hair, big dark eyebrows,

263
00:15:51,981 --> 00:15:56,540
and he had a great personality and he
would take care of everything that came

264
00:15:56,541 --> 00:16:00,470
along friendly. But when it came to
his work, he took it very seriously.

265
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:04,910
The pharmacy was directly across
the hall from the Emergency Room.

266
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:09,470
And so what started happening is, and
noticed this trend, like just to back up,

267
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:13,340
this is the 1940s and doctors are totally
winning against infectious diseases.

268
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,490
And what that meant was that as
far as the public was concerned,

269
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,270
keeping your family healthy
in germ free is a big deal.

270
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:24,620
And that meant keeping your home
clean, super leaving Cli duper no.

271
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,840
Why clean it, really look clean
that day. And at the same time,

272
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,770
oh, that guy,

273
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,150
there's just this explosion of new
cleaning products coming into the market.

274
00:16:34,151 --> 00:16:38,200
Babbo glean your thing brighter than
any other cleanser in the world.

275
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,370
Johnson's jubilee, new blue
cheer. Great for as well as long.

276
00:16:42,371 --> 00:16:45,670
So our kitchen cabinets and cupboards
under the bathroom sink meeting,

277
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:48,670
oxycodone was getting like filled
up with all of these things.

278
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,390
Extremely smelly powders and liquids,
brightly colored bottles and boxes. Oh,

279
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:57,160
leaving cute Mr clean is now the most
powerful I've ever put into a box.

280
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,510
Ooh, good.

281
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,080
And getting back to Lewis,

282
00:17:03,081 --> 00:17:07,220
what he began to notice was that more
and more these doctors were coming across

283
00:17:07,221 --> 00:17:10,550
the hall to his pharmacy, like first one
and then more and more. And you know,

284
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:13,130
they're saying like, Hey, we've
got this kid over in the Er.

285
00:17:13,131 --> 00:17:16,610
He just got into this new cleaning
stuff and we have no idea what's in it.

286
00:17:16,611 --> 00:17:17,900
Can you help us? So, uh,

287
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:22,310
the interns and residents in the emergency
room would naturally come across the

288
00:17:22,311 --> 00:17:27,200
hall to see Lou and Lou helped them
find out what the child had taken.

289
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:31,270
For example, if the child
had swallowed Ajax Guy,

290
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:36,770
that meant he had actually eaten sodium
carbonate and sodium decile benzene

291
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:40,950
sulfonate, which could mean
nausea, diarrhea or vomiting.

292
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,970
And Lou used to keep cards
on every patient that it saw.

293
00:17:44,971 --> 00:17:47,820
So with each new product that was
brought into the emergency room,

294
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:51,780
Lou would write up a new card, white
sail, bleach, sodium hypochlorite,

295
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,490
just pain, vomiting, safety.

296
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:58,860
Glueck decided this was a a thing that
was very needed because by the 1950s

297
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:03,450
there are over 250,000 different
trade names, substances on the market.

298
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,110
And so doctors, they just couldn't
keep up and so lose stack of cards.

299
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:11,160
It grew taller and taller and
taller and pretty soon word got out.

300
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:14,550
Dogs across the country would hear that
there's this guy in Chicago who gives

301
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:19,170
out help on poisoning cases and so many
calls are coming in at all hours of the

302
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:21,150
day and night eventually get dom and
just started telling the switchboard

303
00:18:21,151 --> 00:18:23,790
operators they could go ahead and
transfer the call to his home.

304
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:29,490
We, you get calls from all the different
little law in emergency rooms in the

305
00:18:29,491 --> 00:18:34,410
hospitals. In the state. And what was,
what was it like once you're doing this,

306
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:38,850
then it seems to me that you don't really
have normal hours because emergencies

307
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:42,600
will take place whenever they
take place. So yes. How did,

308
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:47,100
what was he going to be on
call 24 hours a day? Yes.

309
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,590
Really? Yes. Yes he was.

310
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:53,340
We would get calls in
the middle of the night

311
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,490
or even during dinner time.

312
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:01,610
So what happens if you know he's in the
tub and you're cooking dinner and the

313
00:19:02,461 --> 00:19:06,610
phone rings? I would take
the phone to him and the time

314
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,310
and uh,

315
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,660
that's the way it started.

316
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:15,340
And eventually lose little operation
became the first poison control center in

317
00:19:15,341 --> 00:19:18,400
the United States in 1953 in Chicago.

318
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,980
One 802 two, two one,
two do do one 802, two,

319
00:19:23,981 --> 00:19:28,020
two, one, two, two, two k up
your thing. Get Mad at poison.

320
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,430
And the first thing you should do, who
is calling? One 802 two, two one, two,

321
00:19:32,431 --> 00:19:37,180
two, two. Oh, Isen is the kind of
thing you'll not suppose to touch.

322
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:40,840
All prescriptions cleaned and
stuff for spider bites and such.

323
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,890
If you swallowed something bad.
Oh, thank you. Took two months.

324
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,690
Call the poison control center hotline.

We knew that we could
meet anybody in the world.

351
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:33,020
I'm doing everything I should be doing
and it's still not working. Sucked in.

352
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,290
What are you guys complaining about?

353
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:37,650
You guys are the ones that fricking
caused this whole thing. American fiasco,

A bad world cuff is better than
their workout. Do you bet your ass

357
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,450
do one Jad Robert Radiolab. So we are
back with your porter, Brenna Farrell,

358
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,310
who is continuing to um, to inquire
into things poisonous. Before the break,

359
00:22:05,311 --> 00:22:06,144
we just, uh,

360
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,630
learned about Lewis Godolphin who started
the oldest poison control center in

361
00:22:09,631 --> 00:22:13,440
the country back in 1953 in
Chicago. Yeah. And so today,

362
00:22:13,441 --> 00:22:18,441
now we have 55 poison control centers
all across the country and it's one phone

363
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:23,070
number that anyone anywhere in the u
s can call whenever they need help.

364
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,880
What poison center are there
at certain times of day?

365
00:22:26,881 --> 00:22:28,770
Like is there a rhythm
to the day? Generally

366
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,280
usual pattern.

367
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:33,920
It's busy in the morning and kids are
getting ready for school and the peasant

368
00:22:33,921 --> 00:22:37,660
anyways for were people brushing
your teeth with muscle rub cream,

369
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:41,500
kids drinking a little
mouthwash, eating some sunscreen,

370
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:45,590
eating some old mayonnaise, double
doses in the morning. You know,

371
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:50,700
each parent will give the kid a ADHD
medication or then the mid afternoon kind

372
00:22:51,251 --> 00:22:56,251
of tapers down a little bit til like
four or five is the slowest and then that

373
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:56,590
evening,

374
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:00,220
the busiest time of the day overall and
it's like between 6:00 PM and 10:00 PM

375
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:05,370
people coming home from work trying to
get dinner superglue instead of eyedrops

376
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,390
superglue instead of lip gloss.

377
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:11,260
People take the the dodger cast medicine
by mistake instead of their normal

378
00:23:11,261 --> 00:23:15,460
medication. Yeah, that's
a frequent scenario.

379
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:19,030
It gets to be with
adults. I have literally,

380
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:21,860
I have a list here of all the things
that have been used instead of blue.

381
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,880
It's just busy. It's, you know,
just a hectic schedule that

382
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:28,370
we're living in right
now and good almonds,

383
00:23:28,371 --> 00:23:32,540
old stack of cards that's become this
huge database that's tracking like in real

384
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:34,520
time these things that are cropping up.

385
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:38,230
Salmonella that may have
made 22 people sick already,

386
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,590
whether it's a salmonella outbreak or
like last 11 deaths appear to be connected

387
00:23:42,591 --> 00:23:46,280
to heroin being sold in western New
York that's laced with fentanyl.

388
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:48,530
Oh, weird drug reaction
that people are having.

389
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:52,520
Or maybe it's a new product
that's unexpectedly dangerous
or laundry detergent

390
00:23:52,521 --> 00:23:54,560
pods that look like candy.

391
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,920
Now they are being linked to
a tragic death of a child.

392
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:01,700
They can see that in real time and let
health officials or whoever else know

393
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:05,000
about it. Wow. Which is pretty
cool. But I mean, honestly,

394
00:24:05,001 --> 00:24:09,010
just selfishly thinking about
myself as, as a mom, um,

395
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,360
coming out of the trip to poison control,

396
00:24:11,361 --> 00:24:14,810
I remember writing down this
feeling of like, you know,

397
00:24:14,811 --> 00:24:17,930
like what if I just approached all
the scary decisions in my life?

398
00:24:17,931 --> 00:24:19,520
The way that poisoned
control did. Like what?

399
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:22,730
Like kind of thinking like what would
poison control do? Like it just,

400
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:28,030
it felt like such a relief to be
experiencing fetal Barbara Toss,

401
00:24:28,391 --> 00:24:31,460
64.8 milligram tablet. And
how much does she weigh?

402
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,200
Like this super rational place.

403
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,110
Like it was just completely
rational and when did it happen?

404
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,820
How long ago we have this data, we're
going to, what's the name of the product?

405
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,320
Take these questions from you.

406
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,310
Nine 25 let me see if this is even going
to be a problem and then we're going to

407
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:50,090
tell you this is what we think is
going to happen. Okay. Stomach pain.

408
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:53,720
Now she's awake and they'll let you
make a decision or they'll tell you like

409
00:24:53,721 --> 00:24:56,300
straight up, don't worry about it.
I think she's going to be a, okay,

410
00:24:56,430 --> 00:25:00,440
I from here. I know. And then take
it again, but you will be okay. Okay.

411
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:04,040
It just felt like it's stripped
away. A lot of the, um,

412
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,620
like the guilt and the
anxiety and the like,

413
00:25:06,621 --> 00:25:10,760
should I do this and politics and all
those other things that have often swirl

414
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:15,761
around even seemingly to me innocuous
questions about how do I keep this person,

415
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,720
this little person's safe and healthy.

416
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:20,510
There's all this stuff swirling
around it and they just,

417
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:22,480
we didn't have to get into any of that.

418
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,511
I still remains.

419
00:25:23,511 --> 00:25:27,560
For me the most interesting part of this
is that the idea that we're supposed to

420
00:25:27,561 --> 00:25:31,040
know things like, you know, I
talk about this with my dad.

421
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:34,310
I mean there was this
time in medicine when, um,

422
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:38,450
it was all about the doctor in the white
coat. It was this paternalistic thing.

423
00:25:38,451 --> 00:25:42,020
Doctor knows best and no
one wants to go back there,

424
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:45,590
but that there was something
emotionally clean about that.

425
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:50,510
Whereas now we, we have all the
information, it's right there.

426
00:25:50,511 --> 00:25:52,850
This is hand in hand with
the rise of the Internet.

427
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,950
And so increasingly we're
expected to be our own experts.

428
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,110
And it's usually presented as this sort
of simple idea that information is power

429
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:08,060
and it isn't power. I mean it is,
but it's also paralysis. Yeah.

430
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,980
I actually had a rule where I wouldn't,

431
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:13,280
I would only let nick look things
up cause I couldn't, like I was not,

432
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:14,330
it started when I was pregnant.

433
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:17,870
I like would have a panic attack cause
there were so many different things and

434
00:26:17,871 --> 00:26:20,540
like always the top searches are the
ones that like you're going to die.

435
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:24,170
Um Oh yeah. And he's really, he like
you get into the comments field,

436
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,970
oh forget it. Oh God. Right.

437
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:30,500
I mean there's something about when you
look at an answer on a screen and you

438
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:33,350
just one click away from anything,
the exact opposite answer.

439
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,400
And then when you're on the phone with
someone it's just you and that person.

440
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:40,370
Like there is no other distraction.

441
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:44,040
Like there's something built into
the technology that creates exactly

442
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,600
the kind of connection
you need at that moment.

443
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,370
You know, people, when they call you,

444
00:26:47,371 --> 00:26:51,030
it's an emergency there that are
panicking and I think half the battle is

445
00:26:51,031 --> 00:26:53,190
getting them to settle down. And

446
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,900
so this is Tony Berta, the know
everything guy we mentioned earlier.

447
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:00,150
I started in February a of 81

448
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,610
he's been that calm voice for 30 years
and while he was in pharmacy school,

449
00:27:04,611 --> 00:27:05,840
he had an accident. Yeah,

450
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:10,220
I actually started pharmacy school as
a sighted person when I finished as a

451
00:27:10,221 --> 00:27:15,050
blind individual. What, what happened?
I he, he didn't want to say, oh,

452
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:17,200
I don't dwell on it,

453
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:21,320
but like I was sitting there seeing him
doing all of this math and spitting out

454
00:27:21,321 --> 00:27:22,320
these numbers. Yes sir.

455
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,160
They're sights and half lives
and volumes of distribution,

456
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,420
which is totally incomprehensible to me.

457
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:32,220
But he told me that he also like pretty
quickly had discovered early on that

458
00:27:32,221 --> 00:27:35,550
there was this whole other
part of doing this job

459
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:38,020
since September of 82 let's see,

460
00:27:38,021 --> 00:27:41,980
I would have probably had like a year
and a half of experience at that time.

461
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:46,330
I remember I was sitting in the poison
center was another pharmacist and we had

462
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,920
the news radio or am station on,
it was about 10 30 in the morning.

463
00:27:50,921 --> 00:27:52,360
It was news to his flash.

464
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:55,950
[inaudible]

465
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:59,800
bizarre and terrifying story today in
the Chicago suburbs in Arlington heights

466
00:27:59,801 --> 00:28:01,090
and elk Grove village,

467
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:05,710
a 12 year old girl and two men who were
brothers are dead ever taking poison

468
00:28:05,711 --> 00:28:07,810
capsules of extra strength. Tylenol.

469
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:11,980
Several people died from Sinai
that they believe was from Tylenol,

470
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:15,240
five deaths in Chicago, and that
number might be changed to six.

471
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,370
Six deaths have now been
linked to the capsules,

472
00:28:17,371 --> 00:28:19,290
which are leased with cyanide and link.

473
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:23,420
It was this terrifying moment where
thousands of people just simultaneously,

474
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,440
we're all thinking, oh my God,

475
00:28:24,441 --> 00:28:27,140
this thing I brought into my
home to make me feel better.

476
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,870
It could kill me today across the country,

477
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:32,120
Tylenol products were
being pulled from Michelle.

478
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:35,560
The police are like driving their car
slowly on the street with loudspeakers.

479
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:35,920
Like

480
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,280
I think anytime

481
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,280
the back your Tylenol,

482
00:28:40,281 --> 00:28:43,070
don't take any Tylenol extra strength
for the time being until you hear

483
00:28:43,071 --> 00:28:45,620
otherwise. And so, you know, Tony told me,

484
00:28:45,621 --> 00:28:48,590
he's sitting there hearing these news
broadcasts going across the radio and he

485
00:28:48,591 --> 00:28:51,680
just turned to the guy sitting next
to him and the poison girl, senators,

486
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:54,880
holy s, we're gonna,
we're gonna get killed.

487
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,693
Yeah.

488
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:02,920
[inaudible] your phone has been ringing
off the hook at rush Presbyterian St

489
00:29:02,921 --> 00:29:06,160
Luke's medical center in Chicago. He
says he's boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

490
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:09,910
So as soon as you hung up the
phone, the phone rang again.

491
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:14,020
All we've been receiving calls are
about once every 15 seconds this other

492
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:14,890
pharmacist at.

493
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:18,910
And I just grabbed the references and
try and make ourselves cyanide experts,

494
00:29:18,911 --> 00:29:19,870
you know, real fast

495
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:20,500
morning.

496
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:25,090
And the interesting thing about this
case is that in every single one of these

497
00:29:25,091 --> 00:29:28,780
calls that was coming in, if someone
was terrified, someone was panicked,

498
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,120
but they weren't actually in any danger.

499
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:35,840
Officials, hearsay, right? If anyone has
taken a cyanide laced Tylenol capsule,

500
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:40,540
we wouldn't be able to make it to
the phone call. So in some way,

501
00:29:40,541 --> 00:29:42,130
this moment you think about it,

502
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,880
it really kind of highlights this thing
that is really at the heart of poison

503
00:29:45,881 --> 00:29:49,750
control. The specialists not
only were calm, but they, they,

504
00:29:49,751 --> 00:29:53,170
their job was to just reassure like they
were letting people know it was going

505
00:29:53,171 --> 00:29:57,190
to be okay. But if you flash forward
to now that's changing. It's,

506
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,560
they're getting more calls
that are more serious.

507
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,940
They're getting calls from hospitals,

508
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,400
they're getting calls from people
who have taken multiple drugs.

509
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:07,510
And so does that mean that they're
getting less calls from like normal people

510
00:30:07,511 --> 00:30:08,530
and parents that kind of, yeah,

511
00:30:08,531 --> 00:30:12,260
those calls are going down and they
calls over all sense. Like the,

512
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:16,180
in the past decade there've been fewer
calls to poison control. Do you know why?

513
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:20,620
My sense is we don't like to make
phone calls anymore. Like people don't,

514
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,450
they're, you know,

515
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:24,610
like the Internet is there and that's
what we're used to and that's easy.

516
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:29,500
And so they are, they just launched
this new, like instead of calling,

517
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:33,550
you can go to the website and plug in
answers to the questions that they roll

518
00:30:33,551 --> 00:30:37,150
through and it will give you the same
answer based on hopefully the same

519
00:30:37,151 --> 00:30:41,170
knowledge. But then as a person who's
lived through it and like, oh my God,

520
00:30:41,171 --> 00:30:45,160
please don't take away that phone call.
Because when you're in that panic,

521
00:30:45,161 --> 00:30:48,340
the thought of having to sit and type
an answer out while you're holding your

522
00:30:48,341 --> 00:30:50,830
kid and like wondering if
you've really screwed up.

523
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,930
It's like you're taking away something
really valuable that maybe we're not

524
00:30:55,931 --> 00:31:00,580
valuing here. I did have this
one event when my older son,

525
00:31:00,581 --> 00:31:04,700
I've got two sons. It's was very little.
We were living in Sacramento. Yeah.

526
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:07,710
By the way, his author
Deborah Bloom again and uh,

527
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:12,920
they didn't have fluoridated waters
so our doc gave them these tiny,

528
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,950
cute, they were really cute
fruit flavored fluoride pills,

529
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,000
the kind of thing you
could get a toddler to tay.

530
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,080
I don't know what we were doing,

531
00:31:22,081 --> 00:31:27,000
but somehow we had given him his daily
fluoride pill and then like idiots left

532
00:31:27,001 --> 00:31:31,200
it on the kitchen counter and he grabbed
it and pretty much inhaled the whole

533
00:31:31,201 --> 00:31:36,201
bottle and I was really free.

534
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,030
I just didn't know how
poisonous that was going to be.

535
00:31:39,031 --> 00:31:43,740
And I call poison control
and I did I, I was like,

536
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:47,460
am I suppose what I wanted to know
was whether I should panic, right.

537
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,290
I mean he seemed fine.

538
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:54,270
It wasn't like he was getting sick in
any way and they were completely non

539
00:31:54,271 --> 00:31:58,490
freaked out about it. There's like, yeah,

540
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,420
I remember that experience.
Do you remember here?

541
00:32:00,421 --> 00:32:04,830
Did you hear their words or did you
hear their tone? It was the tone.

542
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:10,680
They were so calm and they
could tell I was frayed and,

543
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:14,850
and it can just tell you I'm standing
in the kitchen. We had this phone,

544
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,540
my son's by me, I, you know,
he can tell I'm afraid,

545
00:32:18,541 --> 00:32:19,920
but he doesn't really know I'm free.

546
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:22,560
And I sat on the floor
after I talked to them,

547
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:27,590
I just sat down on the floor with him
because I was just so grateful and I was,

548
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:32,160
and that's what I remember
is how grateful I felt.

549
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,930
Hello? I'm my, my two and
a half year old daughter.

550
00:32:36,931 --> 00:32:39,650
Just the eight most of
the tube of a eight,

551
00:32:39,651 --> 00:32:43,880
five ounce I'm saying is correct.
You're not feeling for some control.

552
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:49,610
[inaudible]. I gave my gun 12 and a
half milliliters of children's Motrin.

553
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,810
And what did you wait
five years? About 25 to 30

554
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:02,320
Oh 0.2 43% zero point queer

555
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,150
[inaudible] water from it.

[inaudible] this was a brand new

557
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,940
[inaudible] Gotcha. Problem here. No,

558

amp e. R r. O. Yeah. Sort of

559
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:29,510
[inaudible] to the other hero.

560
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:34,020
He didn't say anything
[inaudible] no, it's true.

561
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:39,060
You know I have four to five dot.

562
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:44,100
Ly or five percentage for it might
be percent. I'm not sure I what?

563
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:49,510
Five dot. Y 0.4 maybe?
Maybe. Yes. Five point.

564
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,800
Yeah. I'll tell you I bought
board. I thought a problem. No,

565
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,920

she'll be fine. Okay. Yeah, definitely.

566

dog. No, that happened all the time.

567
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:08,410
Yeah, she should be fine. Yeah. All right.
Well thank you so much for your help.

568
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,850
I'd watch him, you know,
he'll be fine. Wow. Let
