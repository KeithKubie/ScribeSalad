00:00:04.167 --> 00:00:07.333
One of the most important aspects
of teaching the humanities...

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.733
is to transmit cultural values across time.

00:00:12.567 --> 00:00:19.067
We pursue the study with the conviction
that we’re training global citizens.

00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:25.367
Expanding your horizons
and learning how to ask new questions...

00:00:25.433 --> 00:00:28.433
and learning how to have
your questions answered.

00:00:30.233 --> 00:00:34.733
This is a place that has art museums
that are unique...

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.167
in their depth and their breadth.

00:00:37.233 --> 00:00:43.033
The humanities shift and change
as the great public issues...

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.667
and public questions of our times change.

00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:51.500
By the time you graduate and you’ve picked
a concentration or a major...

00:00:51.567 --> 00:00:56.600
you’re really poised to do many
and often unpredictable things.

00:00:57.467 --> 00:01:01.567
Harvard is, in the best sense,
a global university.
