so effective altruism is basically

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900
so effective altruism is basically
 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.420
so effective altruism is basically
applying the scientific method and

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430
 
 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.920
 
evidence and analysis to the whole

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930
evidence and analysis to the whole
 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.340
evidence and analysis to the whole
concept of charity it's about so looking

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350
concept of charity it's about so looking
 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.689
concept of charity it's about so looking
in the world you know the world has a

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699
in the world you know the world has a
 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.420
in the world you know the world has a
gazillion problems a lot of them are

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430
gazillion problems a lot of them are
 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.740
gazillion problems a lot of them are
very very bad but some are easier to

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750
very very bad but some are easier to
 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.200
very very bad but some are easier to
solve than others some are cheaper to

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210
solve than others some are cheaper to
 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.200
solve than others some are cheaper to
solve than others and so there are some

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210
solve than others and so there are some
 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.209
solve than others and so there are some
some actions that we can take that are

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219
some actions that we can take that are
 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.100
some actions that we can take that are
more effective than others in reducing

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110
more effective than others in reducing
 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.049
more effective than others in reducing
suffering or increasing that happiness

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059
suffering or increasing that happiness
 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.030
suffering or increasing that happiness
in the world and effective altruism is

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040
in the world and effective altruism is
 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.130
in the world and effective altruism is
basically about identifying what are

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140
basically about identifying what are
 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.260
basically about identifying what are
those methods of improving the world as

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270
those methods of improving the world as
 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.990
those methods of improving the world as
quickly as possible and as effectively

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000
quickly as possible and as effectively
 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.880
quickly as possible and as effectively
as possible so there's within the

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890
as possible so there's within the
 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.350
as possible so there's within the
community there are sort of teams of

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360
community there are sort of teams of
 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.299
community there are sort of teams of
analysts looking at these problems and

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309
analysts looking at these problems and
 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.569
analysts looking at these problems and
figuring out the best interventions the

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579
figuring out the best interventions the
 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.600
figuring out the best interventions the
best charities that are out there and

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610
best charities that are out there and
 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.670
best charities that are out there and
then raising awareness of it picking a

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680
then raising awareness of it picking a
 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.490
then raising awareness of it picking a
charity is is tough and the the things

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500
charity is is tough and the the things
 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.370
charity is is tough and the the things
to look for I guess to start with is is

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380
to look for I guess to start with is is
 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.990
to look for I guess to start with is is
the cause area in itself neglected you

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000
the cause area in itself neglected you
 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.390
the cause area in itself neglected you
know there's there's countless different

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400
know there's there's countless different
 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.160
know there's there's countless different
problems in the world and some of them

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170
problems in the world and some of them
 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.310
problems in the world and some of them
are far more researched or receive a lot

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320
are far more researched or receive a lot
 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.950
are far more researched or receive a lot
more funding than others and similarly

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960
more funding than others and similarly
 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.660
more funding than others and similarly
there are some some problems that are

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670
there are some some problems that are
 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.940
there are some some problems that are
actually but there's just a ton more

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950
actually but there's just a ton more
 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.620
actually but there's just a ton more
room for funding where your money can

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630
room for funding where your money can
 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.469
room for funding where your money can
make a very big difference so that's the

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479
make a very big difference so that's the
 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.789
make a very big difference so that's the
first thing to look for if it's

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799
first thing to look for if it's
 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.810
first thing to look for if it's
neglected next thing is is the is the

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820
neglected next thing is is the is the
 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.160
neglected next thing is is the is the
act is the charity that you're going to

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170
act is the charity that you're going to
 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.170
act is the charity that you're going to
donate for giving you the maximum bang

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180
donate for giving you the maximum bang
 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.539
donate for giving you the maximum bang
for your buck will it help for most

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549
for your buck will it help for most
 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.270
for your buck will it help for most
people with per per dollar that's

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280
people with per per dollar that's
 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.330
people with per per dollar that's
donated another thing to look for is is

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340
donated another thing to look for is is
 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.109
donated another thing to look for is is
the problem you know so are the results

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119
the problem you know so are the results
 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.539
the problem you know so are the results
that it's likely to generate measurable

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549
that it's likely to generate measurable
 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.910
that it's likely to generate measurable
because if we can't measure what the

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920
because if we can't measure what the
 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.370
because if we can't measure what the
charity is doing more than we just don't

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380
charity is doing more than we just don't
 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.340
charity is doing more than we just don't
really know how effective it is so yeah

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350
really know how effective it is so yeah
 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.320
really know how effective it is so yeah
those are some key indicators to look

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330
those are some key indicators to look
 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.760
those are some key indicators to look
for also is is the charity transparent

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770
for also is is the charity transparent
 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.490
for also is is the charity transparent
now not all chair

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500
now not all chair
 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.690
now not all chair
that aren't completely transparent

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700
that aren't completely transparent
 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.590
that aren't completely transparent
doesn't mean that they're necessarily

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600
doesn't mean that they're necessarily
 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.960
doesn't mean that they're necessarily
bad but at the same time if they're

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970
bad but at the same time if they're
 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.130
bad but at the same time if they're
doing very sort of actionable positive

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140
doing very sort of actionable positive
 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.170
doing very sort of actionable positive
things then they should be able to

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180
things then they should be able to
 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.660
things then they should be able to
demonstrate that clearly so yeah those

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670
demonstrate that clearly so yeah those
 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.040
demonstrate that clearly so yeah those
those are sort of the four key points

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050
those are sort of the four key points
 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.780
those are sort of the four key points
I'd look for since starting to play

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790
I'd look for since starting to play
 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.110
I'd look for since starting to play
poker about ten years ago I've been so

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120
poker about ten years ago I've been so
 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.550
poker about ten years ago I've been so
fortunate with my results and the

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560
fortunate with my results and the
 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.160
fortunate with my results and the
opportunities that I've been given

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170
opportunities that I've been given
 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.990
opportunities that I've been given
throughout through it but after a while

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000
throughout through it but after a while
 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.760
throughout through it but after a while
it I started realizing why should

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770
it I started realizing why should
 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.500
it I started realizing why should
probably be doing something else with

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510
probably be doing something else with
 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.270
probably be doing something else with
this you know is there is there a way I

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280
this you know is there is there a way I
 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.130
this you know is there is there a way I
can continue playing the game that I

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140
can continue playing the game that I
 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.650
can continue playing the game that I
love but also have a more positive

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660
love but also have a more positive
 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.790
love but also have a more positive
impact on the world and at the same time

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800
impact on the world and at the same time

the arguments was just so compelling I
 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.820
the arguments was just so compelling I
was like okay how do we how do we get

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310
of research organizations that are
 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.729
of research organizations that are
looking into potential existential risks

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739
looking into potential existential risks
 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.660
looking into potential existential risks
that are likely to hopefully unlikely to

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670
that are likely to hopefully unlikely to
 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.720
that are likely to hopefully unlikely to
happen but if they do happen could be so

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730
happen but if they do happen could be so
 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.400
happen but if they do happen could be so
catastrophic and they're they're they're

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410
catastrophic and they're they're they're
 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.319
catastrophic and they're they're they're
very sort of under researched right now

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329
very sort of under researched right now
 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.040
very sort of under researched right now
so we have quite a broad spectrum of

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050
so we have quite a broad spectrum of
 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.750
so we have quite a broad spectrum of
charities that we raise for but all of

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760
charities that we raise for but all of
 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.240
charities that we raise for but all of
them are either highly effective or

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250
them are either highly effective or
 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.810
them are either highly effective or
projected

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820
projected
 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.160
projected
to be very effective and yeah we we

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170
to be very effective and yeah we we
 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.720
to be very effective and yeah we we
started at two and a half years ago so

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730
started at two and a half years ago so
 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.730
started at two and a half years ago so
far we've raised just over two million

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740
far we've raised just over two million
 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.670
far we've raised just over two million
dollars through the poker industry for

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680
dollars through the poker industry for
 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.720
dollars through the poker industry for
these charities and it's been an amazing

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730
these charities and it's been an amazing
 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:47.250
these charities and it's been an amazing
learning experience

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260
 
 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.519
