00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.420
This is great.

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.340
Now you have your record audio
function executing every time

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.880
the user presses
the record audio button.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.530
This is an example of going
from user interface element,

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.760
in this case the record button,
to your code using an IP action.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.210
What about going to the other way,
from code to user interface element?

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.300
Maybe we want to enable or
disable a button,

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.200
or we want to change
the text of a label.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.920
When you go from code to UI element, you
use a connection called an IB outlet,

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.980
otherwise known as an outlet
from code to UI element.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.850
Let's add that one of those in.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.590
To start with,
let's open back the inspector's panel

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.370
by clicking this button
here on the top right.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.630
Make sure that library's
selected here on the right.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.970
In addition, for a moment, I'm going to
come out of the assistant editor

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.680
just to give me more screen real estate.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.830
There we go.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.500
Now I can see my interface.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.440
I'm going to drag over a label and
a button.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.095
To start with,
I'm going to search for a label.

00:00:57.095 --> 00:00:57.940
Found the one.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.170
I'm going to drag one here.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.379
And I'm going to name
this label Tap to Record.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.160
And I'm going to reposition
it back in the middle.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.540
And then, I'm going to search for
a button.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.510
I'm going to drag
another button on here.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.565
Try to center it as best as I
can in the center of the screen.

00:01:16.565 --> 00:01:22.090
Double-click inside, and type in
Stop Recording for the button's text.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.580
Don't worry about the layout yet.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.190
We're going to tackle
that in just a bit.

00:01:27.305 --> 00:01:30.730
Now, pay attention,
because here comes the unintuitive part.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.910
We want to make a connection
from code to UI element,

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.900
in this case the Tap to Record lable.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.270
&gt;From the document outline,

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.260
find our Tap to Record label
as you can see highlight here.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.150
Hold down the Ctrl key, and
drag it into our ViewController class.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.060
Select outlet, and
name this recording label.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.720
You can now see Xcode's
created an outlet for

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.800
us linking the UI element into code,
or, as we're going to use it,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.694
an outlet from code,
where we can change the UI element.

00:02:02.694 --> 00:02:04.390
Let's use this IB outlet.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.800
Let's make the text change after
the record button has been pressed.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.540
So, what we want here is we want
the text of the recording label

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.050
to change when the record
button is pressed.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.270
You already know which code gets called
when the recording button is pressed,

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.390
that's the function we wrote earlier
as an IB action, right here.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.800
We can add the following line
to the recordAudio function.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.250
If you run the app now, and
press on the Record audio button,

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.710
you should be able to see the text
change to Recording in progress.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.450
We can see that our label and
button are not positioned correctly.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.200
That's okay.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.720
If we press this button,

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.730
we should see this change from Tap to
Record into Recording in progress.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.410
So, we've used an IB action to receive
an interaction, even on a button.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.060
And then, we used an IB outlet to
reach back from code to UI element,

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.180
in this case, the label and
change this text.
