00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.550
We're asked to multiply
65 times 1.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.760
So literally, we just need to
multiply 65-- we could write

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.150
it is a times sign like that or
we could write it as a dot

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.860
like that-- but this
means 65 times 1.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.080
And there's two ways
to interpret this.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.420
You could view this as the
number 65 one time or you

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.980
could view this as the
number 1 sixty-five

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.500
times, all added up.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.189
But either way, if you have one
65, this is literally just

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.130
going to be 65.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.810
Anything times 1 is going
to be that anything,

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.290
whatever this is.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.580
Whatever this is times
1 is going to be

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.080
that same thing again.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:53.240
If I have just some kind of
placeholder here times 1, and

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.190
I could even write it as the
times symbol times 1, that's

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.600
going to be that same
placeholder.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.810
So if I have 3 times 1,
I'm going to get 3.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:09.630
If I have 5 times 1, I'm going
to get 5, because literally,

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.940
all this is saying
is 5 one time.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:21.160
If I put-- I don't know-- 157
times 1, that'll be 157.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.160
I think you get the idea.
