[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.940
SUBJECT: So there's this
great line about music

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.850
that says that "Music is proof
that the human race is greater

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:26.750
than it knows."

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.685
You know that feeling when you
hear a transcendent symphony

00:00:29.685 --> 00:00:30.810
and you get the goosebumps?

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.796
And you're moved to tears?

00:00:32.796 --> 00:00:36.282
And you experience that kind
of cognitive emotional ecstasy?

00:00:36.282 --> 00:00:40.780
It's music's capacity to
communicate the ineffable,

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:41.860
the inexpressible.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.852
It's this urge to language
that human beings have.

00:00:45.852 --> 00:00:47.310
And when crude
words don't work, we

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.620
have to translate
it into symphony.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.840
And these temporary
ecstasies that we

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.430
instrument into existence
need to be recorded.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.156
And our innovations
with recording music

00:00:59.156 --> 00:01:00.280
are even more transcendent.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.170
What started as etching grooves
on an LP, patterning the sound,

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.820
instantiating it into physical
form so that it could be played

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.720
back has evolved now into
a world of binary digital

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.520
information, ecstasies
beamed from brain to brain,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.250
for someone's heart
to someone else's.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.995
This is music.

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:21.400
And indeed, that
line is spot on,

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.670
proof the human race is
greater than it knows.
