00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.100
Jen: Well my key object is the Jensen Graphic,
and it's a very little known project.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.599
It's a graphic design that Frank Lloyd Wright
created for his friend the landscape architect

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:10.599
Jens Jensen.

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:15.710
And it's specifically designed for a conservation
group that Jensen founds in 1913 called Friends

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:16.900
of our Native Landscape.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.509
Essentially what we're looking at is an abstracted
prairie landscape that Frank Lloyd Wright

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:22.509
designs.

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:27.230
The horizontal line that sort of is the datum
of the graphic design represents the prairie,

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.059
the flatness of the prairie.

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:33.670
We also have an abstracted moon with rings
around it, as well as abstracted weeds and

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:34.789
sea pods.

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:39.179
So, right away this tells us quite a bit about
how Frank Lloyd Wright was approaching the

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:43.070
ecology of the prairie and also how he's approaching
nature in general.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.490
He is looking at nature for underlying geometries
and underlying abstractions, not trying to

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.969
create a representational, you know, illustration
of nature.

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:57.699
The preliminary sketch that Frank Lloyd Wright
did in preparation for the Jensen Graphic

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.340
is just as interesting, if not more so than
the more final drawing.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.820
Because on it, Wright actually annotates it
quite a bit and explains in a lot of detail

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.750
what the symbolic meanings of the abstracted
prairie that we see in the final version,

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.340
what those meanings actually are for him and
for Jensen.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.840
So it's a very unexpected moment to sort of
peek into his mind and get a sense of what

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.479
his motivations were and thought processes
and actually to see how Wright himself interpreted

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.979
this object.

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.909
And then, of course, reading that we can also
decide how we, what interpretations we also

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:26.969
bring to the table.

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:34.640
Therese: And then we have this object, which
is my key object, which is perfectly, clearly

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.760
delineated.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.439
And it is undated.

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:40.590
We don't know who made it.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.280
But it is highly abstracted, yet filled with
information about plants, including how to

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.469
plant them.

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:52.710
And this list has some of the indigenous plants.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.439
You know, the asters or the hawthorn or those
kind of prairie plants that I was expecting

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.439
to see.

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:06.490
But I was also finding oriental poppies and
Japanese lilies and all kinds of imported

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.600
Asian plants.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.100
That, of course, made me question why were
these exotic plants being used here?

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.280
Jennifer: It's one of the most sort of well-known
received narratives about Frank Lloyd Wright

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.770
that he is overwhelmingly sensitive to the
native ecologies of the Midwest.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.280
And in doing the research around this graphic
I came to learn, partly through working with

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.310
Therese O'Malley, that in fact the discourse
of the native plants is really just that.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.110
It's a construct or a discourse.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.760
And very frequently Wright and Jensen and
other landscape architects and their milieu

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.490
would use all different kinds of plants, non-native
species, native species.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.820
It wasn't necessarily about creating some
sort of indigenous landscape.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.990
And moreover, the discourse around the plants
actually gets wrapped up into a much larger

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.110
social and political discourse about race
and about immigration and about what's native

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.600
to a certain area that's very much part of
the time period that they're living and working

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.600
in.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.810
So it's not just about ecologies in the sense
of nature or the environment, but it's also

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.870
about social ecologies and political ecologies
and what these networks mean as well.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.660
Therese: That has been a lot of fun is to
take one plant like the hollyhock as we did,

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:17.000
or the sumac as we did, and try to understand
why are these plants so often being depicted

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.250
in stained glass and perspective renderings
like this.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.740
They're everywhere.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.970
And they have great histories.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.320
Histories of introduction to the country,
history of when they're being used in--in

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.680
gardens.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.340
So this particular drawing is very beautiful
too.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.790
So it's very attractive.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.910
It's kind of this Japanese mode that was being
done by his staff.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:57.370
But looking at the hollyhock, that's a great
plant because it was actually naturalized

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.380
in this country.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.600
So, all these things are coming out of discussion
with this one beautiful plant we found in

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.990
the front of the drawing.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.230
And there was always the question of what
is an American garden?

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.410
What is an American design?

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.780
What is American architecture?

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.090
This is a question being asked all the time.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.949
So we have to consider that when understanding
what they're trying to do here.

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:23.919
Jennifer: Right, one of our challenges in
working on this project is just the terminology

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:24.919
alone.

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:25.919
Do you say ecologies?

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:26.919
Do you say environment?

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:27.919
Do you say natural?

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:31.469
I mean, even to use the word nature just raises
all kinds of questions because we assume,

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:36.289
without, if we don't think more critically,
that nature is just a priori that exists before

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:37.289
we do.

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:41.840
But all of these natures are very constructed
for different reasons at different times.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.610
And so even just agreeing on what word to
use was quite complicated.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.590
And we finally settled on ecologies because
it speaks to the interconnectedness between

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:50.590
all of this.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.199
It speaks to the fact they be constructed
ecologies and donâ€™t always just exist on

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:55.199
their own.

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:56.780
And we can also talk about social ecologies
from there.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:57.820
These aren't just about plants.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.080
The plants are also standing in for a larger
set of questions and discourses about the

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.852
structure of society and these kinds of things.
