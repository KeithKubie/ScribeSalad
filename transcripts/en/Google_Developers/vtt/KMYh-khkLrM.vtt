MANO MARKS: Hi.

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:02.770
This is Mano Marks.

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.060
This is the second episode in a
miniseries designed to show

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.100
you how to get started with the
Google Maps STK for iOS.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.620
In this episode, we'll walk
through creating a project and

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.070
adding in the SDK.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.680
This episode assumes that you've
downloaded the SDK,

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.320
registered for an API key, and
set up your development

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.290
environment, and you've
successfully built and run the

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.060
Google Maps SDK demo
sample project.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.240
If you haven't done that, you
may want to start with the

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.360
first video in the series,
which you can

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.470
do by clicking here.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.480
Let's start by creating
a new project.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.720
For simplicity, we'll create a
single view application and

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.300
won't use storyboards.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.060
You can, of course, use
storyboards if you wish.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.090
And here's a video that shows
you how to do it.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.760
Once you've created a project,
you need to add the framework

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.360
to your project.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.230
Open up Finder and navigate
to the folder where you

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.480
downloaded the SDK.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.580
Select the Google Maps Framework
folder and drag it

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.840
to the Frameworks group
in your project.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.860
When prompted, select Copy Items
Into the Destination

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.410
Groups Folder.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.980
Now, right click or control
click on the framework that

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.050
you've just added.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.340
Select Show in Finder.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.110
And in Finder, navigate to the
Resources folder and click and

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.100
drag the Google Maps Bundle,
again to the Frameworks group

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.640
of your project.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.600
This time, make sure the Copy
Items Into Your Destination

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.830
Group Folder is not selected.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.550
Next, you're going to add in
the libraries the framework

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.520
will need to run.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.910
To do that, select the project
and then select Targets and

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.580
Build Phases.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.420
Open up Link Binary With
Libraries, and click on the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.230
plus sign to add in libraries.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.050
Here's a complete list of
the frameworks that

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.780
you'll need to add in.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.710
This list can also be
found at this link.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.490
Next, switch from the target
to the project and select

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.330
Build Settings.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.460
Make sure the architecture is
set to ARMv7 or ARMv7s.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.355
In the other linker flag
section, add in -objc.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.020
Finally, let's add in your API
key to the app delegate.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.330
First, import the Google Maps
framework to your app delegate

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.120
using import GoogleMaps
GoogleMaps.h.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.250
Add the following to
your application--

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.640
didFinishLaunchingWithOptions
method--

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.180
replacing API key with
your API key.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.170
In the final video of this
series, you will

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.420
create your first map.
