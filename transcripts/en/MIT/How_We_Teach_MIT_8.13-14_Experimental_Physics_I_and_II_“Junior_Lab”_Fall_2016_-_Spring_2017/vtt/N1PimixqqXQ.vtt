00:00:05.667 --> 00:00:08.000
SEAN ROBINSON: So we have a
menu of about 20 experiments

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.440
in the lab.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.350
Each student will
do three or four

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.370
over the course of a semester.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.980
New experiments come
into lab every few years.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.410
They usually start
with an idea, usually

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.210
coming from a faculty
member somewhere

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.740
in the Department of Physics.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.140
Sometimes, the idea
for a new experiment

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.590
is something that was
in a research lab.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.510
Sometimes it's just
something that's

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.670
a classic technique which has,
say, become a standard thing

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.340
that the graduate students in
a particular professor's lab

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.020
have to do on a routine basis--

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.270
getting that into a mold that
works within the structure

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.150
of our semester, where
students are typically

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.210
spending about two weeks
performing the experiment.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.180
We want an experiment
in this lab

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.070
to be something
which doesn't simply

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.180
work when you turn it on.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.710
We want the students to
have to cause it to work.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.170
We don't want people to simply
turn the apparatus on and get

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.670
data.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.820
We want them to cause the
apparatus to give good data.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.320
That usually means
there's something

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.580
they have to calibrate.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.310
It usually means
there's lots of settings

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.932
on various parts of
the apparatus, which

00:01:15.932 --> 00:01:18.390
some of the settings give bad
data and some of the settings

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.580
give good data.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.250
And the students constantly
have to be going back and forth

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.070
between some preliminary
analysis and data

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.310
taking in order to
evaluate whether or not

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.055
the data they've
collected is good,

00:01:30.055 --> 00:01:32.180
whether the settings they've
set on their apparatus

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.260
are any good.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.180
Getting a piece of
apparatus, which

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.140
has been designed
by a faculty member,

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.830
as a beautiful piece
of research apparatus

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.970
which works in a reliable way,
in the hands of an expert,

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.250
and getting into something which
a student, who is seeing it

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.920
for the first time,
can operate in a way

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.350
where they have enough
intellectual space

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.560
on the apparatus that they can
explore it, and understand how

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.160
different parts of it work or
don't work, and yet still have

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.340
it be robust enough that
it, say, doesn't break.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.090
It will work consistently
from one roughly

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.860
two week period when a certain
student group is working on it

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.190
to when the next student
group is working on it.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.320
That tends to be more
of a design challenge.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.090
We get into a routine
back and forth

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.880
between the faculty
member who's championing

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.310
the experiment and
the technical staff

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.000
really understanding what
parts of an experiment

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.145
have to be changed.

00:02:27.145 --> 00:02:28.520
And then, ultimately,
someone has

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.640
to write a manual
for the experiment.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.700
There's a model we've been
using for the past few years

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.890
where we get an
experiment to the point

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.140
where we think it's a pretty
good piece of apparatus

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.160
that a student will be able to
learn a lot by performing it.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.440
Yet we still don't have
any manual written for it,

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.999
no instructions or anything.

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:50.540
So if a new student were to just
walk up to it at that point,

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.456
it would be really a
research project for them

00:02:52.456 --> 00:02:54.752
to get it working.

00:02:54.752 --> 00:02:56.210
Within the structure
of Junior Lab,

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.667
we actually do have some
room for that type of thing.

00:02:58.667 --> 00:03:00.500
And the second semester
of Junior Lab, which

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.380
is Subject 8.14, one of the
experiments the students have

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.900
to perform in the
course of the semester

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.236
is not simply something from our
menu of roughly 20 experiments,

00:03:09.236 --> 00:03:11.360
but it's something they
have to develop themselves.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:18.050
They have to write a proposal,
get that proposal approved

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.440
by the funding committee, which
is the staff in Junior Lab,

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.450
and then, ultimately,
perform that experiment,

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.040
analyze the data, and then
present it to their peers.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.331
We have a poster session that
we close out the semester

00:03:28.331 --> 00:03:31.510
with in that course.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.860
So something that has been
useful for the past few years

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.840
when we've developed
a new experiment

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.260
is we try to find one of
these student groups in 8.14

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.290
who volunteers to
perform that experiment

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.980
without any guidance,
without any manual.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.360
They run it through,
basically, as beta testers,

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.140
from our point of view, and tell
us which things worked well,

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.570
which things didn't work well.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.650
And 100% of the time so
far, when we've tried this,

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.130
the students always
discover something new

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.690
that that apparatus can do,
some new physics measurement

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.120
that we didn't think of.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.150
And those new discoveries
by the students

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.600
who perform that the first
time, without any guidance,

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.278
inevitably, those become
part of the manual

00:04:19.278 --> 00:04:23.460
that eventually future students
use as the standard manual

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.844
going forward.
