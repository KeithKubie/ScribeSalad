Hi, I’m John Green and this is Crash Course
World History and today we’re going to talk

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.580
about World War II.
But we’re not going to look at it as a battle

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.170
between good and evil, but instead as a war
for resources, particularly a war for food.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.780
Wait, Mr. Green, Mr. Green, what about like Rosie the
Riveter and Pearl Harbor and Nazis and Hitler?

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.720
Yeah, Me From the Past, I mean if the question is was

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.029
Hitler evil? Then, yeah.
But evil people generally can’t, like, cause

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.169
massive world wars on their own. So instead of talking
about, uh, you know, the personality driven model

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:35.889
of history, I want to talk about resources,
specifically my favorite resource: food.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.680
So the story of World War 2 is commonly told
as a narrative of good vs. evil, and it is.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.200
But we can also look at the second world war
through the lens of resource allocation, and

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.510
I think if we do it tells a story of both
causes of the war and one of the ways that

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.640
it impacted both soldiers and civilians.
The presence or absence of food affected everyone

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.740
involved in World War II. In the most stark
terms, the absence of food led to the deaths,

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.020
directly or indirectly, of at least 20 million
people during those years, as compared to

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.460
19.5 million military deaths.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.640
Now, of course, both the Nazis and the Japanese
were militaristic and expansionist in the

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.240
1930s.
And they were both definitely motivated by

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.800
nationalism, but they were also seeking something
called autarky.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.520
You can remember this term by conjuring the
feeling one gets near Thanksgiving: “Aw,

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.420
turkey”.
You can also remember it when thinking about

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.049
the collapse of the Ottoman Empire: “Aw,
Turkey”.

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:41.100
Anyway, autarky is a form of self sufficiency
in a world where, increasingly, people were

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.170
reliant on world trade, and that made nations
more and more dependent upon each other to

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.709
meet basic needs.
Both Germany and Japan lacked the resources

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:54.280
within their borders that they needed to build
their growing industrial states, and the resource

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.209
that concerned them most was food.
And this was a big part of what motivated

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:02.579
their imperialist expansionism.
Like, Hitler talked all the time about expanding

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.380
German territory to acquire “lebensraum,”
or living space.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.580
But what this meant, of course, was agricultural
land to feed Germans, that’s what living

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.020
space is really about on Earth.
And most Germans of the time remembered the

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.820
blockade during World War I, which had led
to acute food shortages.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.740
For the Nazis, to quote Collingham, “Lebensraum
would make Germany truly self-sufficient and

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.480
immune to blockade and this would eventually
enable Germany to challenge British and American

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.920
hegemony.”
Meanwhile, in Japan the need for food was

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.489
also spurring imperial ambitions. If anything,
Japan’s limited space created a sense of

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.680
crisis and made colonies seem necessary.
Like Japanese colonies in Korea and Formosa,

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.569
taken in the Sino-Japanese war of 1894-1895,
provided 20% of the Japanese domestic rice

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.599
crop by 1935.
And then the Great Depression and Japan’s

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.069
growing population made the situation appear
even worse and probably led to the decision

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.590
to annex Manchuria after 1931.
So the Germans’ plan was to open up Poland,

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.079
and eventually parts of Russia, to German
farmers. The Japanese plan was to resettle

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.219
farmers in Manchuria to provide food for the
homeland.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.740
So if the desire for more food was one of
the initial causes of World War 2, it also

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.319
shaped the actual strategy of the war.
This was especially true with one of the stupidest

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.799
decisions of the war, Hitler’s decision
to invade the Soviet Union.

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.670
A German agronomist named Hans Backe put forth
something called “the Hunger Plan”, and

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.400
in doing so convinced Hitler that in order
to become self-sufficient, Germany had to

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.890
invade the Soviet Union.
And everyone knows that you cannot successfully

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.250
invade Russia unless you are the Mongols.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.540
Anyway, the plan was the Ukraine and western
Russia would be transformed into a huge breadbasket

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.560
that would feed both the German armies and
German civilians. This was never fully implemented,

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.390
because, you know, the Nazi’s could never
successfully nail down all of the territory,

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.659
but Collingham argues that it was a primary
motive for Hitler’s disastrous invasion of the USSR.

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:00.140
And then on the Western front, the so called
“Battle of the Atlantic” was largely about

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.659
shipping arms, material, and food from the
U.S. to Britain.

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:07.609
This was incredibly important in the opening
years of World War 2. Like, Winston Churchill

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:11.670
once said that “the Battle of the Atlantic
was the dominating factor all through the

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.900
war. Never for one moment could we forget
that everything happening elsewhere, on land,

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.109
at sea or in the air, depended ultimately
on its outcome.”

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.110
In short, it was Britain’s dependence upon
other parts of the world that ultimately made

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.500
it stronger than Germany’s attempts at self-sufficiency.
Starvation never became an issue for the Brits,

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.770
but fear of running out of food, especially
of running out of food for the troops, led

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.319
to policies that made starvation a reality
for many people in British colonies.

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:43.840
In British Africa, for instance, colonial
policy forcing production for the war instead

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.970
of for domestic food consumption meant shortages
that were only made worse by wartime inflation.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.139
Crop failure in Rhodesia in 1942 meant widespread
hunger and famine.

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:56.680
And, in an echo of what happened at the end
of the 19th century, World War II and British

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.300
colonial policy spelled disaster for India.
Japan had seized Burma in early 1942, cutting

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.880
off 15% of Bengal’s rice supply.
And when harvests failed later that year,

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.000
hunger turned to famine. Now, the British
could have alleviated the suffering but they were

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:15.900
afraid to use supply ships that might be needed
for the war effort to bring food to starving

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.530
people in India.
When you take into account hunger-associated

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:24.120
diseases, between 1.5 and 3 million Indian
civilians died, more than the total number

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.970
of Indian combatants killed in World War 1
AND World War 2 combined.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.120
In the United States, meanwhile, there was
no starvation, but there was some rationing.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.260
And this was, especially relative to most
recent American wars, some shared sacrifice.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.000
Americans gave up coffee and chocolate so
that the troops could be well fed.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.550
So Americans and Britons hardly suffered from
hunger. Neither did the Germans, actually,

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.830
where memories of World War I made feeding
the civilian population a top priority.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.340
Of course, millions of civilians weren’t
being fed because they were being murdered

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.289
or worked to death in concentration camps.
But in Britain, World War II might have actually

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:02.759
improved people’s diets. Now, Britons largely
despised the whole-meal National Loaf of bread,

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:06.750
but it was more nutritious than white bread
and its flour took up less cargo space.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.030
It’s amazing to think that British people
would dislike good food when there’s so

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.680
much of it in their country.
Stan, this is the part where in the comments

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.400
all the British people say, “We are not
a country, we’re four separate countries!”

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.530
The “dig for victory” campaign encouraged
ordinary people to plant gardens, and so they

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.800
ate more vegetables. Full employment and higher
wages meant that working class people also

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.440
had more access to nutritious foods.
Also, you know, they had the benefit of Canada

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.259
growing like, a gajillion acres of wheat.
Although both the British and the Germans saw

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:36.710
an overall reduction in caloric intake, it
was nothing compared with what was happening

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:43.300
in the USSR, Japan and China. In Russia, daily
caloric intake by the end of the war was half

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.560
of what it had been in 1940.
And I will remind you that things were not

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:52.090
great in 1940 in Russia, because Stalin.
The daily caloric ration for Japanese women

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:57.949
workers fell to 1476 calories, which was bad,
but in China, where the corrupt Nationalist army

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:02.139
was known to sell rice to the Japanese for
profit, a famine in Guangdong claimed the

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:07.830
lives of as many as 1.5 million peasants.
And without doubt, much of the civilian suffering

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:12.330
in the war was related to the massive amounts
of food needed to keep soldiers fighting.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.069
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:07:14.069 --> 00:07:17.879
In World War 2, the US and Britain made a
massive effort to make sure that their soldiers

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:22.039
were well fed, and for the most part it paid
off, even though the food that they got was

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:26.810
sometimes pretty gross. The British World
War I diet of biscuits and bully beef eventually

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:31.430
gave way to the appetizingly named “composite
ration.” American soldiers may have complained

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:36.780
a lot about their infamous C and K rations, but
they were the best fed soldiers in the world, receiving

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:45.020
a whopping 4,758 calories per day, including
meat at every meal, because, you know… America.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.759
As you can probably guess, Soviet soldiers
did not fare so well, especially when the

00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:52.979
Germans invaded because it was their policy
to live off the land, which meant scrounging

00:07:52.979 --> 00:07:56.379
as much food from the Russian countryside
as they could. German troops weren’t as

00:07:56.379 --> 00:08:00.479
well fed as Americans or the Brits, but they
still managed to scarf down a respectable

00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:02.220
4000 calories per day.

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:07.159
No combat soldiers were as consistently hungry,
however, as the Japanese. Japanese soldiers

00:08:07.159 --> 00:08:11.220
were expected to feed themselves and were
not provided with field kitchens. Often this

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:15.099
meant that Japanese soldiers were fueled by
little more than rice. And as the war turned

00:08:15.099 --> 00:08:19.210
against them it became more and more difficult
for Japanese troops to feed themselves.

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:23.259
On Guadalcanal the Japanese attempted to re-supply
their troops with floating barrels dropped

00:08:23.259 --> 00:08:29.840
from passing ships, but by December 1942 between
120 and 130 soldiers were dying of starvation

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:35.680
every day. The Japanese commander there estimated
that while 5000 of his soldiers died in combat,

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:41.860
15,000 starved to death. Overall, it’s estimated
that more than 1 million of the 1.74 million

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:45.730
Japanese military deaths were caused by starvation
or malnutrition.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:49.420
Thanks Thought Bubble. So, a quick look at
the history section in your local bookstore

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:54.120
or an IMDB search will tell you that there
are hundreds if not thousands of ways to tell

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.529
the story of World War II.
And this is just one history of the war, certainly

00:08:57.529 --> 00:09:01.050
not a definitive one.
But examining the role of resources, especially

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:05.410
food, in the second world war tells a story
that has at least one advantage over the narrative

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:10.089
of the triumph of Allied good over Axis evil.
Because it helps us to see that the war was

00:09:10.089 --> 00:09:14.370
not only about the soldiers fighting, and
it gives us a window into the way the war

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.930
affected everyone who lived at the time.

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:20.690
It also allows us to see World War II from
a global perspective in a way that focusing

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:23.910
on strategy or tactics or pivotal battles
doesn’t.

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:28.370
Like very little fighting went on in Sub-Saharan
Africa or most of India, but these places

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:32.800
were deeply affected by the war in ways that
don’t often make it into history books.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.900
Also, we live today in a thoroughly globalized
world, but so did the people of the 1930s,

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:41.320
and it’s very interesting to see some of
their responses to it.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.700
That hyper nationalist idea, that we can take
care of ourselves and don’t need help from

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:50.440
outside, as long as we annex a lot of territory
that’s currently outside of us - that idea

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:54.240
is a response to globalization.
But I think history shows us that it’s a

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.649
horrible response.
It’s a dangerous business when humans imagine

00:09:57.649 --> 00:10:03.459
others as less, when they think their land
needs to become our land so we can feed our

00:10:03.459 --> 00:10:06.010
people.
And in that sense at least, you can’t separate

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:11.950
ideology from resource allocation, and as
long as we live in a world of finite resources,

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:16.639
the potential for conflict will always be
there. Knowing that, hopefully, will help

00:10:16.639 --> 00:10:19.660
us to avoid it. Thanks for watching. I’ll
see you next week.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:23.519
Crash Course is filmed here in the Chad and
