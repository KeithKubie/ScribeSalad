00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.099
&gt;&gt;Van Jones: Hello, You Tubers. My name is
Van Jones. I'm with an organization called

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:09.850
Green For All. We're sister organization for
the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights in

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:10.900
the United States of America.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.960
I think that one thing we all need to be focused
on is building a green economy that is strong

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.680
enough to lift millions of people out of poverty.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.830
The two big issues that are gonna be with
us, are going to be the incredible ecological

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.991
crisis that we're in. The ecological destruction.
And also the social crisis. The widening of

00:00:28.991 --> 00:00:32.999
the gap between rich and poor in all of our
countries and all around the world.

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:37.140
While both are two slightly different problems,
there is one solution. And that solution is

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.760
to build a green economy that's strong enough
to lift people out of poverty.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.620
We're focused on the question of green collar
jobs. We're working to get green collar jobs

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.499
for low income people.

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:51.719
Our idea is we have all this work to be done
to retrofit the way we do energy all around

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.920
the world. There are millions of buildings
that need to be weatherized. There are millions

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.019
of solar panels that need to get put up. There's
millions of wind farms and solar farms and

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.429
wave farms that need to be built. So we can
have energy without destroying the planet.

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:06.710
That's a lot of work and there are millions
of people who don't have work.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.850
I believe the moral challenge of the new century
is to connect the people who most need work

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.520
to the work that most needs to be done. And
that way we can fight poverty and pollution

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.520
at the same time.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.560
If you are an entrepreneur or business person
you should be going green. You should be going

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.990
green and clean. You also should be thinking
about how could we use the fact that we have

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.251
all this work to be done now and doing it
a different way to employ people maybe you

00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:35.460
haven't employed before. The ladder out of
poverty - we need green pathways out of poverty

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.240
and into prosperity, into community, into
dignity.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.850
This is possible through the business community
saying we are going to deal with this problem

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.380
on both sides of it. We're going to be more
fair toward our workers, we're gonna be more

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.050
fair to the communities that we're involved
in. We're going to adhere to the highest standards

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.370
with regard to labor and with regard to the
environment. It's a key role for business.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.000
And as far as government is concerned, the
governments around the world right now are

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.330
partners mainly to the problem makers in the
world. They're partners to the war mongers,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.729
the polluters, the incarcerators, the people
who are doing destructive things. The governments

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.160
of the world need to get on the side of the
problem solvers in the world. On the eco entrepreneurs,

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.200
the solar industry, the coaches, and the counselors,
and the teachers and the artists. The people

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.659
all around the world who are trying to make
a difference, but who feel like it's all uphill.

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:27.469
If the governments in the world were problems
to the problem solvers in the business community

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:32.450
and the and the problem solvers at the community
level, we would beable to see a green wave,

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.489
a green wave that can lift all boats. That's
what we should all be focused on.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.419
Thank you. I'm done.
