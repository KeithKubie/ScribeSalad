00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.810
I've talked a bunch
about the Drake equation,

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.920
or our own version
of the Drake equation

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.850
that starts with the number
of stars in the galaxy,

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.520
but I haven't given
it a shot yet.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.830
I haven't tried my own
attempt at thinking

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.750
about how many detectable
civilizations there are.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.370
So let's actually do that here.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:23.840
So let's just assume that
there are 100 billion stars.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.070
100 billion stars.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.680
So that's my first
term right over there.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.925
Let's say that 1/4
will develop planets.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.030
And let's say of the solar
systems that develop planets,

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.640
on average let's say
that they develop

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.110
an average of 0.1 planets
capable of sustaining life.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.590
Or really, that you'll have
one planet for every 10

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.570
of these solar
systems with planets.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.970
That's just my assumption there.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.880
I don't know if that's right.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.850
Now let's multiply
that times the fraction

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.660
of these planets
capable of sustaining

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.230
life that actually
will get life.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.354
And I don't know what that is,
but I hinted in previous videos

00:01:08.354 --> 00:01:10.020
that life is one of
those things that it

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.660
seems like if you have
all the right ingredients,

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.640
it's so robust.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.060
And you have life it these
underwater volcanoes,

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.630
you have bacteria
that can process

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.260
all sorts of weird things.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.240
So let's say that
probability is pretty high.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.840
Let's say that is 50%,
or half of the plans that

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.456
are capable of getting
life actually do have life.

00:01:27.456 --> 00:01:29.330
I would guess that that
might even be higher.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.100
But once again, just a guess.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.860
Now we have to think
about of the life, what

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.430
fraction becomes intelligent?

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.380
What becomes intelligent over
some point in the history?

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.440
Well, I'll say it's a tenth.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.440
A tenth of all--
maybe if the asteroids

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.510
didn't kill the
dinosaurs, it wouldn't

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.468
have happened on Earth.

00:01:46.468 --> 00:01:47.660
Who knows?

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.010
Or maybe we'd just have some
very intelligent dinosaurs

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.510
around.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.019
We don't know.

00:01:52.019 --> 00:01:54.060
And maybe there's other
forms of intelligent life

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.434
even on our own planet that
we haven't fully appreciated.

00:01:56.434 --> 00:01:58.570
Dolphins are a good candidate.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.600
Some people believe
that octopuses,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.700
because they have
such flexible arms,

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.310
there's a theory that they
could develop eventually

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.039
the ability to kind one
day, if their brains mature,

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.720
and all of the rest, make tools
the same way primitive primates

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.356
eventually were able to
have larger brain sizes

00:02:16.356 --> 00:02:18.230
and actually manipulate
things to make tools.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.839
So who knows?

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:20.380
I don't want to get
into all of that.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.260
So there's a 1 in 10 chance
that you get intelligent life,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.670
and then assuming that
intelligent life shows up,

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.640
what fraction is going
to become detectable?

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.500
I don't know.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.520
I don't know whether dolphins
will ever communicate via radio

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.560
or not.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.790
So let's just say that
is-- I don't know.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:48.210
Let's say that is another 1
in 10 chance, or I'll say 0.1.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.160
And then we have to multiply
it times the detectable life

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.990
of the civilization on average.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.070
Once again, huge
assumptions being

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.790
here, but the detectable
life of a civilization,

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.060
let me just put it
at 10,000 years.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.770
Either they destroy
themselves, or they

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.990
get beyond that type of
radio type communication,

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.490
electromagnetic
type communication.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.200
Maybe they start doing all
sorts of weird, wacky things.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.840
Probably it won't
take you 10,000 years

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.673
to even progress it.

00:03:14.673 --> 00:03:15.940
That might take you less time.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.440
But let's just do this
just for the sake of fun.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.300
And then the lifespan
of your average star,

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.240
that's probably
one of the things

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.880
that we have the best sense of.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.900
So on average, let's put
it at 10 billion years,

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.839
10 billion years.

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:29.130
So let's calculate all of this.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.580
Let's get my handy TI-85 out.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.260
And so we're going
to have 100 billion.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.060
That's 1 times 10 to the 9th.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.000
Sorry, that's 100
times 10 to the ninth.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.260
So let me clear it.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.590
Or you could have 1
times 10 to the 11th.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:55.510
That is 100 billion times
0.25 times 0.1 times .05 times

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:04.960
0.1 again, times 0.1
again, times 10,000

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.090
divided by 10 billion.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.670
So times 10,000, 1, 2,
3, divided by 10 billion.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.769
So that's one 1e10.

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.339
1 times 10 to the 10th power.

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:21.440
1 with 10 zeroes.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.830
So let's see what we get.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.820
We get 12.5, which is
kind of a neat number,

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.200
but these are heavily
dependent on this.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.490
So we're saying if
given these assumptions,

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:37.740
there should be 12.5
detectable civilizations

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.510
in our galaxy right now.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.550
So the question is, why
aren't we detecting it?

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.240
Maybe their radio signals, maybe
their electromagnetic waves

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.900
are getting to us, but we can't
differentiate it from noise

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:52.400
right now.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.525
And that's what the whole
SETI project's all about,

00:04:54.525 --> 00:04:57.760
of trying to keep track
of all this information,

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.810
all of these radio waves, and
electromagnetic waves that

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.410
are coming from outer
space towards Earth,

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.519
and seeing if any of them
actually have any non noise

00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:08.810
signal, that actually look
like they're being generated

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.180
by some type of
intelligent civilization.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.830
So maybe we're getting them, and
we're just not detecting them,

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.380
or maybe something
else is at play.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.660
Maybe we've overestimated
one of these.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.830
Maybe there is a lot a
life, but maybe they're

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.256
not using electromagnetic
waves to communicate.

00:05:23.256 --> 00:05:25.630
Maybe that's some type of
primitive way of communicating.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.974
Maybe they start doing
telepathy, or something crazy,

00:05:27.974 --> 00:05:29.890
or they start using some
type of quantum thing

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.110
that allows them to communicate
more directly without having

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.150
to wait for the speed of light.

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.054
That is a very slow
way to communicate.

00:05:37.054 --> 00:05:38.720
And it is a slow way,
frankly, if you're

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.290
trying to communicate
across solar systems,

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.930
and stars, and planets,
or even across galaxies,

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.030
one could imagine.

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.320
So maybe we're just kind
of at a transition state

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.417
of communication, that
electromagnetic waves, radio

00:05:51.417 --> 00:05:53.250
and all the rest is
just a transition state.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.708
Maybe in 100 years
we'll figure out

00:05:54.708 --> 00:05:57.060
another, better way
that's not detectable

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.320
in our traditional ways.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.300
Maybe we're being bombarded with
another type of communication

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.870
mechanism that we're just
not ready to perceive yet.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.040
Who knows, but it's just
a fun thought experiment

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.855
to say that hey, given
these assumptions,

00:06:08.855 --> 00:06:10.980
there should be at least
a couple of civilizations,

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.840
or a handful of
civilizations that we

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.260
might be able to detect.
