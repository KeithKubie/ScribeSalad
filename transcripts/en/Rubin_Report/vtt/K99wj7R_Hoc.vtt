WEBVTT

1
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:05.421
All right.

2
00:00:05.421 --> 00:00:10.421
So let's shift to Jordan Peterson a little bit because you are a student at the

3
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.040
University of Toronto.
That's where he's been teaching for many years.

4
00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:17.370
This whole kerfuffle over trans gender pronouns,

5
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.650
these stolen.
So like everyone's yelling at each other and hate each other.

6
00:00:21.651 --> 00:00:25.040
I blame him.
What is,
what's the atmosphere like at the school?

7
00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:26.900
Actually he's not teaching there right now.

8
00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:29.090
We could obviously he's on tour in the book and the whole thing.

9
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.250
But has the atmosphere changed then?

10
00:00:31.251 --> 00:00:34.570
Do you think it's directly related to some of the stuff that he on earth?

11
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.870
I think it has changed because there you can see the groups get and when someone

12
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.730
you know has a slightly right wing or,

13
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.110
it's funny cause I know Bateau bay associate individualism and the fact that

14
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.990
they associate thinking for yourself with being right wing,

15
00:00:47.991 --> 00:00:51.140
it's like why would you want to do that?
It should not be anyways.

16
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.240
Why wouldn't you want to be right wing man?
Wait,
like what?
Um,
yeah.

17
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.810
Uh,
so the,
the,
when you're a little bit more right wing,

18
00:00:59.811 --> 00:01:02.450
I guess they tend to say that,
you know,

19
00:01:02.451 --> 00:01:06.110
you are joining Peterson fan and you hate transgenders and blah,
blah,
blah,

20
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.140
like there's a clear divide,
you can tell which side people are on.
Um,
but I,
yeah,

21
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.000
I think it was bound to happen regardless and just again,

22
00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:15.480
because of the Trump presidency to like,

23
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.890
can we just blame Trump for everything here?
Yes.
You're in America now.

24
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.620
It's on your inbound to bring California too.
So that's how,
yeah,
yeah.
Watch out.

25
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.150
Um,
so you sort of viewed it as kind of a necessary evil that he sort of got this

26
00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:31.210
stuff.
I mean,
again,
it goes to what we were talking about earlier,

27
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.450
like some of these people get these issues out there and then hopefully some

28
00:01:35.451 --> 00:01:38.960
goodness,
yes.
After them.
Yeah,
definitely.
And um,

29
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.860
I think the other thing is Trump allowed people,
like I said earlier,

30
00:01:42.861 --> 00:01:46.850
to think for themselves in the sense of understand that maybe not everything is

31
00:01:46.851 --> 00:01:50.270
how it seems.
Maybe things that I'm learning is not exactly how it is.

32
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.670
And you know,
I,
you know,
I may disagree with his politics like,

33
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.800
because I'm a liberal in general.
Um,
but I do think that yeah,

34
00:01:57.801 --> 00:02:01.790
it was bound to happen and Trump kind of shook things up and allow a lot more

35
00:02:01.791 --> 00:02:03.080
people are engaging in politics now,

36
00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:06.810
which is so exciting and also really scary at the same time.
Why is it that in,

37
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:07.850
I mean that's it right there.

38
00:02:07.851 --> 00:02:11.240
I think just this morning I tweeted something out to that effect.
It's like,
wow,

39
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.070
it's incredibly exciting.
Doesn't mean things are going to be good.
I actually,
uh,

40
00:02:16.071 --> 00:02:19.430
I believe things actually are going to get better because there's so many cool

41
00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:24.050
new young people like yourself out there putting out ideas.
Like I have hope,

42
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.330
but yeah,
it doesn't mean that that's how it's going to go.
It might,
yeah.

43
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.230
It might go the other way.
Yeah.
But then the other thing is that because,
um,

44
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.890
the far left are scared that people are starting to,
you know,
do more research.

45
00:02:33.891 --> 00:02:36.770
We first started to Google things nowadays.
Um,

46
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.550
they've started to ask why they want to control Google.
Exactly.
Eggs.

47
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.380
So now that you can't find any right information,
you can only find there's,
yeah,

48
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.250
yeah.
Um,
but now they're changing definitions of things.
So I mean,

49
00:02:49.251 --> 00:02:51.590
the definition of racism is no longer individual.

50
00:02:51.591 --> 00:02:54.530
It has to do with power plus privilege.
So in other words,

51
00:02:54.531 --> 00:02:56.960
only white people can be racist towards minorities.

52
00:02:56.961 --> 00:02:59.380
Minorities cannot be racist towards white people.
Um,

53
00:02:59.381 --> 00:03:01.150
they've also taken hold of the,

54
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.120
like student unions and Jordan Peterson has talked about this a lot.

55
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.190
I'm so sorry,
what was the question?

56
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.480
<v 2>We generally was a about Jordan and being a student at University of Toronto.</v>

57
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.560
<v 1>Yeah,
keep going.
You don't,
yeah,
I just feel like I'm,</v>

58
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.400
the student unions are just influencing a lot of the students in their

59
00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.540
influencing a lot of the events that are happening.

60
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.090
They claim to speak on behalf of all students.
So,

61
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.270
and they claim that they're fighting against racism because I be defined it a

62
00:03:26.271 --> 00:03:27.460
different way.
I mean,

63
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.890
was going to go against someone that says are fighting against racism and sexism

64
00:03:30.891 --> 00:03:34.520
and every other buzzword that they can throw out there,
you have to accept it.
Um,

65
00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.680
and because they've changed the definition of racism,

66
00:03:36.681 --> 00:03:39.290
they've started to have events and there was a white privilege conference,

67
00:03:39.291 --> 00:03:43.430
which I actually did a video on.
Yeah.
Why priors at Ryerson University.
Yeah.

68
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.770
So that's the way that they're countering it.

69
00:03:45.771 --> 00:03:47.940
They're countering the facts with just,
you know,

70
00:03:47.941 --> 00:03:51.300
we'll all die alternative facts with their own,
uh,

71
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.250
B s feminist studies ideas.
I don't even know.
But that's,

72
00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.510
I guess the way they're doing it.

73
00:03:56.511 --> 00:04:00.260
They're trying to influence students from schools something when they get out,

74
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.460
they can become more liberal.

75
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.230
<v 2>So the things that Jordan talks about when he talks about the individual and</v>

76
00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:07.960
when he talks about why the government shouldn't be able to tell you what

77
00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:09.310
pronouns do you use,
etc. Etc.

78
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.720
You see these things as all directly related to everything else that you've been

79
00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:14.450
talking about here.

80
00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.270
<v 1>Yeah,
no,
for sure.
And I think it's also about,
um,
sorry,
I just blanked it.</v>

81
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.823
So

82
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.150
<v 2>we were at a Jordan event,
that's where,</v>

83
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.870
that's where we met about a month ago in Toronto.

84
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.580
And was it a white supremacists?
Oh yeah.
Pull in sales.

85
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.350
<v 1>I was stoned on my way out.
Yeah,</v>

86
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.261
<v 2>I mean,</v>

87
00:04:33.261 --> 00:04:37.820
but were you surprised at all when you saw what type of and and an interesting,

88
00:04:37.821 --> 00:04:40.430
diverse young,
I think most of them,

89
00:04:40.431 --> 00:04:44.150
I've been telling people it's about 60 40 male to female,

90
00:04:44.151 --> 00:04:46.120
but sometimes it's even closer to 50 50

91
00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.820
<v 1>yeah.
No,
I think it's pretty diverse.
And I've gone to several events,</v>

92
00:04:49.821 --> 00:04:53.090
like a political events.
I guess where I look in the crowd,
I'm like,
wow,

93
00:04:53.091 --> 00:04:55.490
there's a lot of minorities here.
There's women here,
there's one here,

94
00:04:55.491 --> 00:04:57.410
there's everyone here.
And sorry,
where I,

95
00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.610
where I blanked was the idea that you can't,
you can't debate something.

96
00:05:01.611 --> 00:05:05.800
That's where that was the whole PD.
I'm like ranting here.
Sorry,
here's the,

97
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.870
and gets me like all excited cause I was there.
So he had this effect on people.

98
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.850
But the fact that you can't debate certain topic,

99
00:05:13.851 --> 00:05:16.490
the fact that you can debate whether or not we should use certain pronouns

100
00:05:16.491 --> 00:05:18.740
because they say,
well you're questioning my identity.

101
00:05:18.741 --> 00:05:20.660
You're questioning me as a person.
My humanity,

102
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.210
they turn it around and make it sound like you hate that person.

103
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.360
And that's the thing is it's not like I agree with Peter Cena.
I agree with the,

104
00:05:26.361 --> 00:05:30.050
you know,
the students.
I just want to hear both sides.
That's all I'm asking for.

105
00:05:30.051 --> 00:05:32.720
Something we can all make an informed conclusion,

106
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.750
but they don't want you to hear both sides.
They want you to hear their side.

107
00:05:35.751 --> 00:05:39.320
And that is the only side you see what happened with like Lindsay Shepherd as

108
00:05:39.321 --> 00:05:40.230
well,
where she,
you know,

109
00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.520
played a Peterson debates where they're all sides and they don't want you to

110
00:05:43.521 --> 00:05:46.820
hear that.
They only want you to hear their side.
And that's where,

111
00:05:46.821 --> 00:05:49.100
that's one thing I hate the most is just the lack of discussion.
Yeah.

112
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.360
<v 2>Yeah.
So I'm glad you brought up Lindsey,</v>

113
00:05:50.361 --> 00:05:54.380
because that also is happening in Canada.
That was at Wilfrid Laurier university.

114
00:05:54.381 --> 00:05:57.890
Now there's a lawsuit that she's involved in and suspect

115
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.080
<v 1>I read some of the initial brief,
I mean,</v>

116
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.130
I think this thing is going to be a bloodbath for the university.
Um,

117
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.790
but what does that say is happening in Canada in a larger way?

118
00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:09.200
I think you've kind of hit on this a little bit.

119
00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:10.760
Like you guys were almost having like this,

120
00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:14.780
like Trump hangover or something where,
or even the black lives matter thing.

121
00:06:14.781 --> 00:06:16.850
Like it didn't start in America as you said,

122
00:06:16.851 --> 00:06:21.230
race relations were different in Canada.
I would argue they're still great here.

123
00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:25.000
It doesn't render.
Canadians are just nicer.
Okay,
great.

124
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.930
Canadian just generate you guys.

125
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.760
We've done two shows in Toronto and the shows were totally nice and pleasant.

126
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.280
But like we've gone to some other cities where,

127
00:06:34.281 --> 00:06:38.210
and I find it's usually in the progressive cities.
So it's been in,
you know,

128
00:06:38.211 --> 00:06:42.380
San Francisco and it's been in Seattle and a couple of the others where the

129
00:06:42.381 --> 00:06:46.010
crowds are the craziest most rockets,
which is what I liked was cause they kinda,

130
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.150
they need his message.
Toronto,
you guys are very pleasant,

131
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.970
very pleasant.
We're getting to a point where we need his message.
I think it's,

132
00:06:54.971 --> 00:06:58.640
it's getting a little scary,
especially with Trudeau as our prime minister.

133
00:06:58.641 --> 00:07:01.790
He's kind of cow towing to a lot of the social justice warrior.

134
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.800
And the fact that he's even,
you know,
talking to black lives matter Toronto,
who,

135
00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:10.700
you know,
the leader,
one of the leaders said she wants to kill white man.

136
00:07:10.701 --> 00:07:13.910
She tweeted that she wish she can kill all white men and the other one actually

137
00:07:13.911 --> 00:07:16.970
stole $300,000 from my student union,

138
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.300
stole it and said the she on her last day.

139
00:07:20.301 --> 00:07:24.650
She filed her over time and she's filed thousands of hours of overtime and said

140
00:07:24.651 --> 00:07:29.651
she filed $300,000 worth of over our entire budget of our student unions budget

141
00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.470
a third and here's the best part of it.
She files dot.

142
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:35.600
Obviously there's alerts that go off.

143
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.830
You can't take that much money for what are your student union president?

144
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:43.460
$300,000.
Sure.
There aren't that many hours in the day,
but here's the thing.

145
00:07:43.461 --> 00:07:47.120
She claims that the majority of those hours come from work that she does for the

146
00:07:47.121 --> 00:07:50.000
black community,
for like black lives matter.
That doesn't count.

147
00:07:50.001 --> 00:07:53.630
No one is asking you that's not affiliated with the school.
No one's asking you.

148
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.740
Whatever you do at home has nothing to do with that.
Anyways,

149
00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.880
the school obviously said they wanted the money back.

150
00:07:58.881 --> 00:08:01.970
They try to sue her and they started a whole campaign saying,

151
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.540
my university is anti black.
And then they started to put posters up.

152
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:09.020
They got gathered a bunch of people saying that they're their only suing her

153
00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:13.820
because she's black.
You stole 300,000.
You took $300,000 girl,
like,

154
00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:18.140
are you because you're a black?
Are you kidding me?
Does that not even,
anyway,
she,

155
00:08:18.141 --> 00:08:20.420
you know,
they vandalized the student union.

156
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:24.140
They have like megaphone starts yelling,
saying anti black racism happens here.

157
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:27.920
Hence,
and it was just this whole ordeal.
Like it's,
Ugh,
Gosh.
Anyways,

158
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:32.270
what does it sound the best arguments to get people your age to wake up to some

159
00:08:32.271 --> 00:08:34.640
of this stuff?
Like,
I know obviously they're watching your videos.

160
00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:37.760
That's like probably your,
your prime way of doing it.

161
00:08:37.761 --> 00:08:40.100
But have you found simple arguments,

162
00:08:40.101 --> 00:08:44.930
simple phrases or whatever that you can use to get some people out of this?
Uh,

163
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.760
everything can be explained the way through a socioeconomic standpoint.
You,

164
00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:54.110
uh,
there are a lot of the issues that the black community faces because they're

165
00:08:54.111 --> 00:08:58.980
poor,
which is the same issues that poor white communities face as well.
And,
um,

166
00:08:59.130 --> 00:08:59.671
I,
you know,

167
00:08:59.671 --> 00:09:04.290
there are examples of black Americans and black Canadians that do do well to do

168
00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:07.770
well and a,
you have to look at why they're doing well.
Okay.

169
00:09:07.771 --> 00:09:11.670
So they have higher education.
You know,
there's,
they're both parents are at home.

170
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.550
There were all these different factors to look at and then it's like,
oh,

171
00:09:14.551 --> 00:09:16.470
so it's not just the color of my skin,

172
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.080
it's either choices or I make or the area I'm in,

173
00:09:19.081 --> 00:09:22.470
the surroundings I'm in or the school I went to rather than just,

174
00:09:22.471 --> 00:09:24.300
it's the color of my skin.
Um,

175
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:28.890
but I think you just have to break it down to that before a lot of people can

176
00:09:28.891 --> 00:09:32.910
understand where I'm coming from and why I think a certain way.
Um,
it's just,

177
00:09:32.911 --> 00:09:36.240
it's easy to just to say,
well,
it's because I'm black and I'm not doing as well.

178
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.180
It's,
no,
there's,
there's so many different ways to explain it.

179
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.030
How did he rub off all the stuff that they must say about you?

180
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.510
Because I have enough friends that are black conservatives or,

181
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.340
or are kind of liberal and whenever you want to call it that.

182
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:51.220
The things that I see get that gets said about them all the time.

183
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.970
Every time Larry elder comes and does my show and I look on Twitter,

184
00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:57.610
the things that,
the things that the supposedly tolerant people,
right?

185
00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:58.990
The progressive's,
the left,
these,

186
00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.390
that they say about this man who I know is being authentic.
Um,
well,

187
00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:07.560
it's ridiculous.
I mean,
I get a lot of,
uh,
hate comments where,
you know,

188
00:10:07.561 --> 00:10:10.320
they'll call me coon,
they say hate myself.
I want to be white.

189
00:10:10.321 --> 00:10:11.320
All these different things.
I,

190
00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:14.910
it's the one part is like me speaking this way or speaking,
I guess,

191
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:18.600
I don't want to say proper English per se,
but I tried to be white.

192
00:10:18.601 --> 00:10:20.340
I'm trying to be something I'm not in.
It's like,

193
00:10:20.341 --> 00:10:22.680
why are you fitting people a race in a group?

194
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:26.760
You're just allowing white people just to say,
well,
black people are just dumb.

195
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:29.910
Because if you saying we all act the same way and we should all think the same

196
00:10:29.911 --> 00:10:33.690
way,
that means you can,
every black person can be explained with one statement.

197
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:36.180
That's not fair.
Let us all be individuals.
In fact,

198
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:39.270
you should be fighting for us to be individuals and have our own ideas.

199
00:10:39.271 --> 00:10:43.050
Why are we trying to form groups?
And then they wonder why,

200
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.780
why there's all these like white supremacist groups forming up.

201
00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:47.340
Cause you've already,
it's a site's thing.

202
00:10:47.341 --> 00:10:50.040
You said there's our side and there's your side.
So you're like,

203
00:10:50.041 --> 00:10:53.910
okay sure we'll form a group I guess and go against you.
Um,
but yeah,

204
00:10:53.911 --> 00:10:56.220
I mean I don't,
a lot of the hate comments are just useless.

205
00:10:56.221 --> 00:10:57.780
I ignore the epithets,

206
00:10:57.781 --> 00:11:01.650
but I do try to understand a lot of the criticism and again,

207
00:11:01.651 --> 00:11:04.560
it's just not understanding where I'm coming from.
It's not,
you know,

208
00:11:04.561 --> 00:11:07.740
getting their stats from the right place,
the root.com or onion.

209
00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:11.420
It's not somewhere to get your facts
but,

210
00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:15.450
or like that you compare those.
But when I,
um,
you know,

211
00:11:15.451 --> 00:11:17.700
get into a detailed discussion with a lot of them,

212
00:11:17.701 --> 00:11:20.520
then they understand where I'm coming from and it's like there's this light that

213
00:11:20.521 --> 00:11:21.331
kind of shines.

214
00:11:21.331 --> 00:11:24.570
And I do that at my school a lot as well at where someone that absolutely hates

215
00:11:24.571 --> 00:11:27.750
me,
I'll spend a whole day talking to them.
And at the end I call it like,

216
00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:32.310
it's really awful to use this conversion therapy or awful.
Um,
um,

217
00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:35.970
you're not electrocuting no,
but by the end of it,

218
00:11:35.971 --> 00:11:39.660
it's like their minds are blown because they just believed everything.

219
00:11:39.661 --> 00:11:43.530
Black lives matter said everything the mainstream left media have said.
So it's,

220
00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.170
I think it's just,
you just got to talk to them.
They don't want to talk.

221
00:11:46.171 --> 00:11:47.580
They're stuck in echo chamber.

222
00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:52.970
Do you see this intersectionality and this combining of perceived depressions,

223
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.130
something that

224
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:58.540
<v 2>will just sort of crap out under its own weight.
So like for example,</v>

225
00:11:58.541 --> 00:12:01.690
if you're going to keep saying,
well,
black people should,
or this minority,

226
00:12:01.691 --> 00:12:02.710
whatever that might already is,

227
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.070
should get easier entrance to this or access to this or whatever.

228
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:07.600
What you're actually saying is,
well,

229
00:12:07.601 --> 00:12:10.870
other people are going to have to be punished based on their immutable

230
00:12:10.871 --> 00:12:12.610
characteristics.
We see this now.

231
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:16.300
I mean I see a massive split happening with the Asian community right now in

232
00:12:16.301 --> 00:12:19.930
America because by every metric that we judge success,

233
00:12:19.931 --> 00:12:22.990
they are succeeding at extremely high levels because of hard work and education

234
00:12:22.991 --> 00:12:25.750
and commitment to family.
But if you're going to start saying,
well,

235
00:12:25.751 --> 00:12:29.160
we're going to have to take less of them because we have to take more of other

236
00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:32.560
people.
You're actually setting these groups to hate each other.
Yeah,
that is so

237
00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:36.260
<v 1>danger.
Exactly.
And you're telling one group that they can't do it on their own.</v>

238
00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:40.040
And um,
there are some studies,
I forgot who it was who wrote it,

239
00:12:40.041 --> 00:12:42.590
but it was called the mismatch theory,
which is,
um,

240
00:12:42.591 --> 00:12:45.700
a lot of the student minority students are getting thrown in universities or to

241
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:48.050
not qualified actually turn out worse when they come out.

242
00:12:48.051 --> 00:12:50.660
They don't get jobs because they don't have the actual skills that they needed

243
00:12:50.661 --> 00:12:53.360
to get in.
But yeah,
it creates this kind of tension.

244
00:12:53.361 --> 00:12:55.370
Why would you tell someone that,
you know,

245
00:12:55.371 --> 00:12:57.770
they're more important just because of the color of your skin.

246
00:12:57.771 --> 00:13:00.050
It's going to piss other people off.
Um,
it's,

247
00:13:00.051 --> 00:13:01.460
I don't think that's a way to move forward.

248
00:13:01.461 --> 00:13:03.230
I don't think that's a way to progress.
But yeah,

249
00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:06.080
and the whole intersectionality thing,
it's,
it's ridiculous.

250
00:13:06.081 --> 00:13:09.200
The Pride Parade I guess in Toronto is an example of that.

251
00:13:09.201 --> 00:13:13.460
It's like my issues are more important.
And then obviously the Lgbtq community,

252
00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:17.390
they all hated that and they were all very upset with it cause it's like pride

253
00:13:17.391 --> 00:13:21.050
is one of the most inclusive,
you know,
events in,
in the,
in the city.

254
00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:23.720
Why are you trying to ruin it and say this is a black thing.

255
00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:28.040
It's an everybody thing.
We're,
we're all advocating for everyone here.
So it's,

256
00:13:28.041 --> 00:13:29.840
it's,
they're just going to,
yeah,

257
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:32.080
they're going to ruin themselves if they keep just adding.
Yeah.

258
00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:34.010
<v 2>Speaking of that,
I saw the thing that you did.</v>

259
00:13:34.011 --> 00:13:38.870
You are not happy when they put the black and brown stripes into the rainbow

260
00:13:38.871 --> 00:13:41.440
flag,
which I also thought was completely [inaudible].

261
00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:43.940
The whole point is that this is for everybody.

262
00:13:43.941 --> 00:13:47.000
We're not looking at all your differences and all your races.
Yeah.

263
00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:50.630
<v 1>That's one thing.
It's like reverse segregation.
I really don't get it.</v>

264
00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:53.060
The white privilege conference at Ryerson University.
Yeah,

265
00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:56.150
that's reversed segregation and I actually gave him the benefit of the doubt.

266
00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:57.860
I'm like,
I'm going to ignore the name.

267
00:13:57.861 --> 00:14:00.230
I'm going to actually try to see what they're trying to teach.

268
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:02.810
And ultimately the end,

269
00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.960
the conclusion of this event was listen to people,

270
00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:07.430
listen to what people are saying.

271
00:14:07.431 --> 00:14:10.340
So anecdotes only listening to people their feelings.

272
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:13.220
So it's like that's not how you form a society.

273
00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:15.320
It's the majority were white women.

274
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:18.380
They were just sitting there hearing black people tell them,

275
00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:22.640
just listen to our stories because we know and we experience it and you know we

276
00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.890
have to have,
you know,
black spaces.

277
00:14:24.891 --> 00:14:27.350
In fact there someone at tweeted during the event saying,

278
00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:31.430
I'm a woman just rules our hand to speak while whitesplaining wait for the,

279
00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:35.330
for leader where we have our white corners or we can talk about,
you know,
are,

280
00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:40.070
what is this?
What kind of society are we preparing herself for?

281
00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:44.240
It's literally reverse segregation or segregation in the true sense of the word.

282
00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.680
And I,
yeah,
I really don't.
What

283
00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:50.870
<v 2>do you make of the guilty white allies?
Those people,
you know,</v>

284
00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:55.760
when I've had a,
I know you met Frat Weinstein from evergreen and Heather,

285
00:14:55.761 --> 00:14:57.200
his wife.
Um,

286
00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:00.950
one of the things that fascinated me most when he was going through the ordeal

287
00:15:00.951 --> 00:15:05.780
there was that he said he never feared the black students physically or the

288
00:15:05.781 --> 00:15:07.490
brown students or whatever it was.

289
00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:11.330
It was the white allies he said that had this sort of look in their eye.

290
00:15:11.331 --> 00:15:15.620
Like they were the ones that could get violent.
And I've seen that,
that look,

291
00:15:15.621 --> 00:15:18.980
what do you make of that sort of agenda?
Hatred.

292
00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:23.770
<v 1>Cause it's hard to,
to,
cause if you're not black then,
I mean,</v>

293
00:15:23.771 --> 00:15:26.380
they're trying to explain it.
If you're not black thing,
you don't experience it,

294
00:15:26.381 --> 00:15:28.720
then you don't understand it.
So I said,
why I lie,

295
00:15:28.721 --> 00:15:30.910
you have to just take everything,
you know,

296
00:15:30.911 --> 00:15:35.470
an activist says to you as fast as this is what is happening.
Um,

297
00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:37.390
one of the speakers,

298
00:15:37.391 --> 00:15:40.480
actually he did an interview for the Toronto Star and they asked him and I was

299
00:15:40.481 --> 00:15:44.350
like,
okay,
what,
where do you see white privilege in Toronto?
And he said,

300
00:15:44.351 --> 00:15:49.030
literally,
I mean,
I'm paraphrasing,
but he said,
when you walk into a store,

301
00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:52.630
black people or black people have to think about the fact that people are

302
00:15:52.631 --> 00:15:54.490
watching them.
Okay,
sure.
I was like,
fine,
whatever.

303
00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:58.960
But apparently black people have to pay for items in one section before they can

304
00:15:58.961 --> 00:16:03.130
move to another section.
So they don't get accused of stealing.
That's his,
his,

305
00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.980
he got a chance to tell us what white privilege is.

306
00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:09.050
And that was his example of white privilege.
Is that happening?
No,

307
00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:13.290
it's never happened.
I've worked retail for like the most of my life.
One,

308
00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.150
you're gonna like pay the kid section before you go to the men's section.

309
00:16:16.151 --> 00:16:20.650
Like what world is this guy living in?
It blew my mind.
And another one,
you know,

310
00:16:20.651 --> 00:16:24.610
did an article where it's how the outdoors is racist and how,
you know,

311
00:16:24.611 --> 00:16:28.780
people feel like the,
you know,
skiing and hiking and everything is a white space.

312
00:16:28.781 --> 00:16:30.850
And therefore black people don't want to go to it.

313
00:16:30.851 --> 00:16:34.510
And it's like who you're saying it,
you're the one that are making these claims.

314
00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:39.040
Why are we there?
It's just more division.
It's more like I just,
it pisses me off.

315
00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:41.910
<v 2>Yeah.
You know what?
We're in it because you're visiting La for a couple of days.</v>

316
00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:43.051
I don't have a ton of time,

317
00:16:43.051 --> 00:16:44.910
but maybe we could go on a quick hike and see what happens.

318
00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:49.060
<v 1>I know
exactly,</v>

319
00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:50.163
but it just like,

320
00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:53.740
you're obviously don't care about the betterment of the black community cause

321
00:16:53.741 --> 00:16:56.890
you wouldn't be talking about these non issues.
You're in the stage.

322
00:16:56.891 --> 00:17:00.730
You can talk about,
you know,
uh,
sorry,
how the education system works.

323
00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.370
You can talk about the war on drugs.
You can talk about the prison system,

324
00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:08.240
but yet the amount of people they got to protest the Trayvon Martin,
you know,

325
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:12.400
uh,
shooting.
If you can get that many people to protest the war on drugs,

326
00:17:12.401 --> 00:17:15.760
you can probably make a change.
But no,
they're going to focus on,
you know,

327
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.920
I think police shootings,

328
00:17:17.921 --> 00:17:21.220
it's one of the least things that are actually affecting black Americans.

329
00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:23.140
But yet that's what they want to put their focus on.

330
00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:25.950
<v 2>So how much of the root of that is just lazy thinking?</v>

331
00:17:25.951 --> 00:17:30.120
Like it's easy to get people gender up about a shooting per se,

332
00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:35.580
and I'm not,
I'm not diminishing that are wrong.
Obviously.

333
00:17:35.581 --> 00:17:39.090
It's all clear.
It's easier to take all of the antidotal stuff,

334
00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.640
the woman at the shopping center who this happened to her that,
yeah,

335
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:45.540
it's always easier to do that than to really be like,

336
00:17:45.541 --> 00:17:48.750
let's really look at the prison systems,
which I would be for looking,

337
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:50.070
I would be figuring

338
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:54.990
<v 1>out ways that we can do better education to minority communities that had been</v>

339
00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:57.840
neglected.
All of those things.
But those things aren't really sexy.

340
00:17:57.841 --> 00:18:01.110
They're not like the things that get people out on the streets for more than a

341
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:03.930
day.
It's the other stuff.
So part of this is just human nature,
right?
Yeah.

342
00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:07.770
I totally agree.
I mean,
I,
I can base all my arguments on anecdotes,

343
00:18:07.771 --> 00:18:10.410
but that doesn't like,
that means nothing to me.
I can just say,
oh,

344
00:18:10.411 --> 00:18:13.710
well this one day I've lived in Toronto all my life and I've never experienced

345
00:18:13.711 --> 00:18:16.290
racism.
I'm not going to use that as facts,
but yeah,

346
00:18:16.291 --> 00:18:18.930
but it's so much easier to do.
So it's so much easier to,
you know,

347
00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.990
if playing with the heartstrings and say like this is what's really happening.

348
00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.680
But it's just,
it's just sad that there are actual policies that you know,

349
00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:29.160
can be changed or put in place that could actually uplift the black community.

350
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:32.940
But you know,
none of the people that are that claim to be the activist care,

351
00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:36.570
especially the celebrities,
which really annoys me.
Beyonce and Jay Z,

352
00:18:36.571 --> 00:18:38.820
all they do is talk about,
you know,
black rights and blah blah.

353
00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:41.130
Why don't you use your billion dollars to,
you know,

354
00:18:41.131 --> 00:18:44.670
create some rehabilitation center for people that are getting out of prison.

355
00:18:44.671 --> 00:18:46.560
Why don't you try to fight for the war on drugs?

356
00:18:46.561 --> 00:18:50.790
Like it's all these things where it's,
it's,
yeah,
it's,
it's easy just to say,

357
00:18:50.791 --> 00:18:52.380
oh look,
there's a shooting.
You know,

358
00:18:52.381 --> 00:18:54.450
this is what black people experience every day.
And you know,

359
00:18:54.451 --> 00:18:57.210
white people are racist.
The end.
No,
it's theirs.
I don't know.

360
00:18:57.211 --> 00:18:58.950
It's easier for them to just to say,

361
00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.800
look at this anecdote in this shooting and that's what's affecting us.

362
00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:03.750
But there are so many other things that could be done.

363
00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.860
A little bit of my appearance at University of New Hampshire when those kids

364
00:19:07.861 --> 00:19:10.800
were,
oh yeah,
yelling at me and when that one woman who,

365
00:19:10.801 --> 00:19:13.910
I don't think it was a student,
I think she was either a mother of a student or,

366
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:17.280
or than advisors when she kept saying,
you know,

367
00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:21.420
these kids pointing to the black kids could get shot when they walk out of here.

368
00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:25.920
She's talking about it University of New Hampshire and it's like,
I actually,

369
00:19:25.921 --> 00:19:28.820
that was one of the only moments where I didn't know what to say because it's

370
00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:33.150
was so crazy to say that like you're not going to be shot and you walk out of

371
00:19:33.151 --> 00:19:36.180
here.
And I think I maybe said something to that effect,
but like,

372
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:40.020
it's like that's really dangerous,
that line of thinking.
I totally agree.

373
00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:41.430
And I was actually having a,

374
00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:44.490
I went to a comedy club the other day and there's this guy on stage.

375
00:19:44.491 --> 00:19:49.350
He was like typical inner city black youth or whatever.
And uh,
he,

376
00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.330
after his sat,
he came to sit in my table,

377
00:19:51.331 --> 00:19:54.510
everyone was gone and he made a comment saying,
um,
wow,

378
00:19:54.511 --> 00:19:58.230
it was really hard to be a black woman in this country.
And this is again,

379
00:19:58.231 --> 00:20:01.560
this is Canada.
I feel like there's no excuses for Canada,
like,
get out of here.

380
00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:05.190
Um,
and then I asked him,
okay,
how,
and he's just like,
I don't know,
it's just,

381
00:20:05.191 --> 00:20:07.770
it's really hard to be,
you know,
a woman in black.
I'm like,
yeah,

382
00:20:07.771 --> 00:20:10.170
I get the whole woman thing cause you know,
men or if you know,

383
00:20:10.171 --> 00:20:12.360
physically bigger and blah,
blah,
blah.
Um,

384
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:15.720
but why is it hard for me to be black and Toronto specifically?
And he's like,

385
00:20:15.721 --> 00:20:18.960
you know,
cause you know,
there's just white privilege.
And I'm like,
no,
no,
no,
no.

386
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:20.040
Give me two reasons.

387
00:20:20.041 --> 00:20:23.740
Give me to concrete reasons could not come up with one because there isn't,

388
00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:26.820
you can't come up with,
when you have to use the anecdotes,
you have to use the,

389
00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:29.670
you know,
if you walk out in the street,
you're going to get shot.
Why,

390
00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:31.860
what are the statistics of people that get shot by police?

391
00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.950
Oh seven get shot by police per year.
And it's not recorded by race.

392
00:20:34.951 --> 00:20:38.040
And it's also doesn't tell us if they're armed or on our seven people.

393
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:40.830
And you're telling me you're more likely to walk out the door as a black person

394
00:20:40.831 --> 00:20:44.010
get shot.
That's not an epidemic.
You know,
what's an epidemic?

395
00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.440
The crime in black communities.
That's an epidemic.

396
00:20:46.441 --> 00:20:49.210
But you want to ignore that and just talk about the other yeah.

397
00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:53.680
Anecdote that pull at the heartstrings and make people feel guilty.
And uh,
it's,

398
00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:57.160
it's a waste of time.
It's such a waste of time.

399
00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:59.620
<v 2>Oh,
what do your parents think about what you're doing?
Uh,</v>

400
00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.730
well they are conservative,
so they love it.

401
00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:06.280
So what makes you not conservative?
We've,
so if someone was to say,
you are,

402
00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.060
you're conservative,
I watch your videos.
Yeah.

403
00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.940
Talk about conservatism is not that bad.
Blah,
blah,
blah.

404
00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:15.680
Why would you not say you're sort of putting aside the exhaustion of labels,

405
00:21:15.681 --> 00:21:15.880
right?

406
00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:19.410
<v 1>Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,
well I will say specifically conservative.
So,</v>

407
00:21:19.411 --> 00:21:22.410
I guess I do believe in like lower taxes and some science.
Um,

408
00:21:22.411 --> 00:21:25.920
I do believe in the free market.
I do believe in,
you know,
less regulations,

409
00:21:25.921 --> 00:21:27.960
all that fun stuff.
But at the same time,

410
00:21:27.961 --> 00:21:32.400
I do think that there should be some sort of social safety net and uh,
you know,

411
00:21:32.401 --> 00:21:36.960
living in Canada where there is,
you know,
I'm sorry,
free health,

412
00:21:36.961 --> 00:21:39.810
not free healthcare,
universal healthcare and you know,

413
00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:42.940
at the university education,
the education system is amazing.
The,

414
00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.840
the funding for the education system is amazing.
Um,

415
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:49.140
so stuff like that where I think I'm a little bit more liberal where I do think

416
00:21:49.141 --> 00:21:52.020
the government should help in some way,
but it's because I'm used to it.

417
00:21:52.021 --> 00:21:55.200
It's what I grew up with and I haven't really seen anything different.

418
00:21:55.201 --> 00:21:59.580
And it works.
It works fine.
Um,
so I guess that,

419
00:21:59.581 --> 00:22:00.710
and I'm pro choice,

420
00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:04.980
I'm so stuff like that where I really do stand firm in my liberal views and

421
00:22:04.981 --> 00:22:07.130
ideas and then,
yeah,
I'm fiscally,

422
00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:09.540
<v 2>I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Wow.
We're pretty much aligned.</v>

423
00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:11.820
[inaudible] I finally found somebody,

424
00:22:11.821 --> 00:22:15.420
now we can go out hiking yet or we can start beating people.
Exactly.

425
00:22:15.421 --> 00:22:18.330
I don't know what supposed to do once you find an ally but you start attacking

426
00:22:18.331 --> 00:22:21.360
other people.
I think that's how it works.
Something like that.

427
00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.750
Where do you want to go with all this?
I've seen,
I've seen your channel grow.

428
00:22:24.751 --> 00:22:26.620
I think obviously,
you know,
have a new here at all.

429
00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:30.480
It'll help boost your profile a little bit.
You got to go into politics.

430
00:22:30.481 --> 00:22:32.310
What are you going to do?
Prime Minister of Canada,

431
00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:37.830
take out that Trudeau guy with his fancy socks.
What do you mean?
Oh Gosh.
Um,

432
00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.070
well maybe,
maybe Peterson will do it,
but you could probably be in his cabinet.

433
00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:43.500
<v 1>Yeah,
definitely.
Sorry.</v>

434
00:22:43.501 --> 00:22:48.501
Well I am enjoying what I'm doing now and I'm quite surprised that people even

435
00:22:48.781 --> 00:22:50.040
enjoy watching my videos.

436
00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:53.520
I think it's cool to do something you love and people like it as well.

437
00:22:53.521 --> 00:22:58.080
Like I really am having fun doing it and I think I would probably go into

438
00:22:58.081 --> 00:23:00.810
politics later in life.
I mean I am doing political science.

439
00:23:00.811 --> 00:23:05.220
It has to be useful somewhere.
I've been toying around with law,
but again,

440
00:23:05.221 --> 00:23:08.060
I'm not sure if I really want to be in,
you know,
the whole,

441
00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:11.370
I don't know if I want to deal with law school.
Um,
but,

442
00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:14.400
and I am starting actually a podcast with my boyfriend,

443
00:23:14.401 --> 00:23:17.900
which I would be uploaded very soon.
Bye.
So,
yeah,

444
00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:20.110
<v 2>I,
the way we should tell people yes,</v>

445
00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:23.580
they'll find out otherwise your boyfriend is white.
Yes.
Claim writings,

446
00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:27.380
which means you could have potentially children who look black.

447
00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:30.080
They might look white,
they look a little bit of both.

448
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:34.270
You've talked about that a little bit.
It doesn't really matter to you.
No,

449
00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.550
of course not.
No.

450
00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:37.413
<v 1>Uh,
yeah.</v>

451
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:40.560
My boyfriend being white has been used as like an attack against me saying like,

452
00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:42.400
wow,
look at you.
Uh,
what did they say?

453
00:23:42.401 --> 00:23:44.860
Sleeping with the devil or something like that.

454
00:23:44.861 --> 00:23:49.730
And it's just seems like a decent fella.
He's a great guy and play Nintendo.
No,

455
00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:51.430
he's a great guy.
But again,
it's,

456
00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:55.850
it's the whole idea of why are you creating more divisiveness and then saying

457
00:23:55.851 --> 00:23:56.690
you want equality.

458
00:23:56.691 --> 00:24:00.230
Why are you saying a black woman being with a white man is bad and then say,
wow,

459
00:24:00.231 --> 00:24:03.920
white people are mean to me.
Like you either want equality or you don't,

460
00:24:03.921 --> 00:24:06.410
you either want individuality or you don't pick one.

461
00:24:06.411 --> 00:24:11.210
You can't have both again and it,
sorry.
But yeah.
Um,
yeah,

462
00:24:11.211 --> 00:24:15.440
I'm,
I'm not 100% sure where exactly I will be in the next five years.

463
00:24:15.441 --> 00:24:18.740
I'm having fun with what I'm doing now.
I worked for the National Post,

464
00:24:18.741 --> 00:24:22.100
which I absolutely love.
And then I have the podcast coming.

465
00:24:22.101 --> 00:24:26.290
So that's what I'm going to do for now.
And maybe I'm,
I get into politics but oh,

466
00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:27.350
it's so messy.

467
00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:32.660
The fact that you even are go in that far right now you're doing it.
Oh God.

468
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:36.470
I hate to tell Ya.
I can see it now.
How exciting.

469
00:24:36.471 --> 00:24:39.080
I'll have somebody to support and care.
You know what you get,

470
00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:43.100
you do something in Canada where you run and you become something,

471
00:24:43.101 --> 00:24:46.730
mayors something whenever you want to do,
I will consider moving.

472
00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:51.020
Oh my [inaudible] you can pull it off.

473
00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:55.760
It'll be a big freaking test though.
You see what happens.
Definitely think I do.

474
00:24:55.761 --> 00:24:59.750
Okay.
There are white guy.
Oh No,
I'm sorry.
You're done.
You're done.
You're done.

475
00:24:59.751 --> 00:25:00.010
For,

476
00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:02.780
you're going to have to start giving me like half of your page just cause you

477
00:25:02.781 --> 00:25:04.130
know racism and stuff.
Yeah.

478
00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:08.960
But I think one thing that I would actually probably like to do,

479
00:25:08.961 --> 00:25:11.420
which I probably will not be able to,
but uh,

480
00:25:11.421 --> 00:25:15.380
to do a lot of work in like inner city communities.
Cause I've,
I,

481
00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.120
I don't want to say I've lived through it,

482
00:25:17.121 --> 00:25:20.570
but I understand what's going on there.
I understand that,
you know,

483
00:25:20.571 --> 00:25:24.280
there's high crime understand that in some neighborhoods the schools aren't as

484
00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:25.640
good for Canada's a little different.

485
00:25:25.641 --> 00:25:28.730
But I'd like to do some work there where I can kind of tell them,
hey,

486
00:25:28.731 --> 00:25:31.970
I got out and here is what I did to get out.
And you can do it too.

487
00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.220
There's so many,
there's opportunities there for you.

488
00:25:34.221 --> 00:25:37.520
Like if you were poor minority,
you know,
child right now,

489
00:25:37.521 --> 00:25:40.880
please just try your hardest at school,
get an education.

490
00:25:40.881 --> 00:25:43.970
It's literally one of the greatest opportunities that you can have.

491
00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:47.600
And you're more likely,
I mean you probably not 100% great,

492
00:25:47.601 --> 00:25:50.660
but you're more likely to be successful if you get an education.

493
00:25:50.661 --> 00:25:54.770
And that's the one thing a lot of black people are lacking is the education

494
00:25:54.771 --> 00:25:56.630
component.
And um,
you know,

495
00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.550
we don't really have like the war on drugs and everything.

496
00:25:58.551 --> 00:26:03.170
So it really is weird for me that in inner cities of Toronto where there's still

497
00:26:03.171 --> 00:26:07.040
this very high crime,
there's still this tension.
Um,
but you know,

498
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:09.410
that'd be ever heard of the Woodson center by any chance.

499
00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:13.220
It's a nonprofit organization.
It's located in DC.
Um,

500
00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:15.950
but I've been working with them for some time and they basically do the same

501
00:26:15.951 --> 00:26:16.220
thing.

502
00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:19.190
They go out to these neighborhoods and they help students and they have such a

503
00:26:19.191 --> 00:26:21.200
good success rate.
They held them in high school.

504
00:26:21.201 --> 00:26:24.080
Cause that's the other thing is that a lot of black kids are not even graduating

505
00:26:24.081 --> 00:26:24.560
high school.

506
00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.990
Of course they're going to go into crime if you're not even graduating high

507
00:26:26.991 --> 00:26:30.140
school.
Um,
so yeah,
they work with a lot of students there.
They,
you know,

508
00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:34.000
have rehabilitation centers.
They help.
You'll,
uh,
black,
sorry,

509
00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:36.680
black Americans reintegrate into society like it,
stuff like that,

510
00:26:36.681 --> 00:26:39.320
where it's these grassroot movements.
And I would really like to do,

511
00:26:39.321 --> 00:26:41.390
and I know it's a,
it's a big dream,

512
00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:44.160
but I think that's where I would probably be happiest,

513
00:26:44.161 --> 00:26:47.820
is where I can show people how it's done and help them.

514
00:26:47.821 --> 00:26:50.490
And hopefully everyone can copy that and say,
Oh,

515
00:26:50.491 --> 00:26:54.180
this is what we're supposed to do and all of that.
But awesome.
I love it.

516
00:26:54.181 --> 00:26:56.190
And I have no doubt that you're going to do it.

517
00:26:56.191 --> 00:27:00.960
And you guys can follow this future member of Canadian parliament on her youtube

518
00:27:00.961 --> 00:27:04.710
channel right here.
It's youtube.com/my name is Josephine.

519
00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:13.020
<v 0>Yeah.</v>
