00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.230
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: From the Library
of Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.460
&gt;&gt; Mary Jane Deeb:
Let me welcome you

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.010
to the African Middle
East Division

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.620
on the beginning of Spring.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.630
I know it doesn't
feel quite like it,

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.220
but I would like to wish you
a belated happy [inaudible]

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.010
but this event is framed
within the lecture series

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.010
for [inaudible] so welcome

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.600
to the African Middle
East Division,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.850
and I'm Mary Jane Deeb.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.650
I'm the chief of the division,
and I'm really happy to be able

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:57.010
with my colleague Hirad Dinavari
to host this event today.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.070
Unfortunately the head of
the [inaudible] section

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:06.140
who should have been here today
has not been able to come.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.180
It's due to something
in the family.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.330
But the African Middle
East Division,

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.100
and this particular room,
has hosted numerous programs,

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.320
and has hosted the entire
series that Hirad Dinavari,

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.300
our Persian specialist, will
be talking about in a minute.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.510
It's a lecture series that
started after our exhibit

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.240
in 2014, "1,000 Years
of the Persian Book."

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.950
And that was the first
exhibit of its kind

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.840
that highlighted the Persian
collections here at the Library.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.200
And brought in hundreds of
thousands of people visited them

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.870
over a period of six months.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:08.580
And it is this way of
putting forth the collections,

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:16.100
putting forth the items that
we hold, and sharing them

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.130
with the public because
we're sharing them not only

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.260
with you here in this room,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.870
but as this program
is being webcast.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.280
We're sharing this program
with the rest of the world

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.240
because those programs
will be put on our screen,

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.290
the screen of the
Library of Congress,

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.000
and are accessible
anywhere around the globe.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.460
So if you have friends,
people you know in Iran,

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.000
or anywhere else,
you can let them know

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.650
that we had this program today.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:06.020
And this program is on popular
Iranian cinema before the

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:15.780
revolution, and it is presented
by Doctor Pedram Partovi.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.880
The importance of this is

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.940
that we do not simply
bring you programs,

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.130
but we bring the scholars who
have studied, who have worked

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.920
on these programs, who can
share their experience,

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.780
their expertise, their
knowledge, their insights

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.500
with all of us to
make the collections

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.260
that we hold better understood,
better appreciated, by everyone.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.250
And, in a way, this is a role,
the role of this division.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.170
And the role of all the
divisions in the library.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.210
This division represents
78 countries.

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.190
We have the whole Middle East
which is rather expansionist

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.350
because we are not limited
by political definitions

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.640
of where we stand, but rather
by linguistic definitions.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.600
So Persian is spoken not only
in Iran, but much further away.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.160
And in Afghanistan, in
Tajikistan, and beyond.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.020
So our region goes
from, you know --

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.600
from the west in Morocco,
and through to the east,

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.950
to Afghanistan, and
northwards to the whole

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.950
of Central Asia,
and the Caucuses.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.360
This is just the Near East.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.240
Then we have Africa, and that is
the whole continent of Africa,

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.070
every single country of Africa.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.670
And then we have the
Hebraic world which is --

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:53.350
represents not only a
region, not only a place,

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.220
but also the collections
of Hebraic

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.320
and Judaic around the world.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:09.490
So with this [inaudible] I will
let my colleague Hirad Dinavari

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.280
introduce the speaker today.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.250
Hirad.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.780
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari:
Thank you, Mary Jane.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.080
Appreciate that.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.070
Want to thank you all for
coming during the workday.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.850
I know it's busy
and it's lunch time

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.690
and this is a [inaudible]
lecture opening.

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.330
Essentially every year we do
our Persian book lecture series

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.650
in the Spring period around the
[inaudible] season, and we usher

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.700
in the season and the
lecture series together.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.380
Our speaker for today
is Doctor Pedram Partovi

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.010
who is a historian of
medieval and modern Muslim --

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.080
Medieval and Muslim
-- I'm sorry.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.070
Doctor Pedram Partovi is a
historian of the medieval

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.510
and modern Muslim world.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:04.530
His current research focuses on
the history of youth movements,

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.630
and the role in creating and
destructing the political order

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.320
in Iran and the greater
Middle East.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:16.080
This project springs
from his earlier work

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.240
on popular Iranian
cinema which is --

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:27.630
which in its depictions of male
heroism and problematization

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:33.160
of the effort of state agents
to eliminate or to co-opt

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.840
in the name of modern progress.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.900
Doctor Partovi is a lecturer,

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.060
and has given many
classes currently

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:49.840
at American University, and
is fluent in Persian, Arabic,

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:54.140
Hindi, Urdu, and
also is familiar

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.650
or is knowledgeable
in French as well.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.560
And he is going to
speak about the book

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.890
that he has recently done
on popular Iranian cinema,

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:09.730
and I'm not going to take
more time, and let him start.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.510
Thank you.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.580
[ Applause ]

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.650
&gt;&gt; Doctor Pedram Partovi:
Well, first of all,

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:23.300
thank you very much to Mary Jane
and Hirad, and to the Library

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.480
of Congress staff
for inviting me.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.920
Yes. I'm going to talk a
little bit about the book

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.500
that I've recently published.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:37.400
Maybe I'll just show you very
briefly where you can get it.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.480
So [laughs] it's
published by Routledge.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.420
I realize it's very expensive,

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:45.900
and I certainly don't
expect you to buy it.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.210
But if you would
like to read it,

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:50.910
there's an ebook
version that's $50,

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:53.340
and in the future I've been told

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:56.070
that there will be
a paperback version

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:57.640
as well that will be cheaper.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:05.730
But yes. Ask your library to
buy it for their collection.

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:15.610
So I want to talk about popular
Iranian cinema before the

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:17.440
Islamic revolution.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.390
Some of you might know
something about Iranian cinema.

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:23.330
There's been an enormous amount

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.510
of literature about
Iranian films.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:29.690
You may have also seen
some Iranian films.

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:33.400
But the Iranian films that we
have seen, we have heard about,

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.700
we read about, here

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:38.280
in the United States are
not necessarily the films

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:42.100
that many Iranians
in Iran have watched.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:45.530
Most critics and academics
have presented the history

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:50.240
of Iranian cinema in a very
selective manner with many gaps.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.670
And from some accounts
one might conclude

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:56.270
that the Iranian cinema is no
more than a few decades old,

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.590
either taking shape
with the establishment

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:00.850
of the Islamic Republic
or even later

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:04.650
after the Iran Iraq
war in the 1980s.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.920
What we do learn
about the cinema

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.940
in Iran before the
Islamic revolution

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:13.540
in these histories is
often limited to a handful

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:18.330
of pioneering films and
filmmakers in the late 1960s

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:23.960
and 1970s that supposedly paved
the way for globally recognized

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.290
and increasingly globally
oriented post revolutionary

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:28.590
Iranian cinema.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:31.280
So what I'm doing in
this book is looking

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.660
at what's been largely
left out or dismissed

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.680
in these film histories,
the products

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:41.170
of the prolific commercial film
industry that first took form

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:44.520
after World War II, but reached
the peak of its popularity

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.780
in the 1960s and early 1970s.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.440
We're not talking about a
small number of films here.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:54.000
Roughly 1,000 domestic studio
productions were released

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.770
in Iran from the late
1940s until the late 1970s

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:02.720
when the commercial industry
essentially collapsed.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.430
And during its heyday in
the 1960s and early 1970s,

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:10.460
there were on average about
60 releases every year.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:15.260
Iran was also at this time
undergoing rapid social

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:22.350
and economic change coinciding
with the dramatic expansion

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:24.170
of the state's role
in peoples' lives.

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:28.380
So I try to answer a few
questions in this book.

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:32.260
And these include, why does a
commercial film industry emerge

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.230
at this particular
moment in time?

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:38.620
Who exactly made up the
audiences of these films?

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.680
What kinds of ideas, themes,

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:44.310
and images regularly found
their way in to these films?

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:47.540
Did the seemingly formulaic
elements have any links

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:52.380
to older forms of entertainment
in Iran or in the wider region

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:53.680
or were the productions

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.930
of the late [inaudible]
era simply secondary copies

00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:00.310
of Hollywood titles, as
their critics claimed?

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:04.670
And if they weren't just poorly
done homages to Hollywood films,

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:07.990
then what might these films
have to tell us about Iran

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:10.590
in those final decades
of Pahlavi rule?

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:13.150
Was social and political
critique part

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:14.730
of their entertainment?

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:17.300
How, in other words,
did these films comment

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:20.250
on the unprecedented
efforts of Pahlavi elites

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:23.740
to transform the lives
of ordinary citizens?

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:27.610
Well, we don't have enough
time to go through all

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:29.380
of the arguments
in the book today.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.010
Hopefully those who are
interested will go out

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:34.720
and buy it or ask their
libraries to buy it.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:39.780
I'm not too proud to beg.

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:43.890
Given the lack of familiarity
that non Iranians have

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:46.130
with these films, I
thought that the best use

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:48.550
of our time today is to
simply give you a sense

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:52.330
of the unique origins of the
commercial industry in Iran,

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.670
and some of the things that
came to define the films

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:58.260
that domestic studios produced.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:02.160
I also want to address
critiques of these films

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.240
that have contributed
to their absence

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.340
from scholarly accounts
of Iranian cinema.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:10.740
And finally I'd like to show
you some clips from these films,

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.870
given that so few people

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:15.950
in America have ever
come across them.

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:18.310
But I will warn you in
advance that the picture

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:22.300
and sound quality of
these clips is not great.

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:26.730
Again, because of their poor
reputations they've been largely

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:30.210
ignored by both state
and private organizations

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:35.210
in a position to preserve
them for future generations.

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:37.730
There are some efforts being
made in Iran to do something

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:41.330
about this, but again
money is always the issue.

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:45.080
And even though there
are some efforts,

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.590
these are very, very
limited ones.

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:48.890
I mean there's been a sort

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:51.410
of remarkable consensus
among cultural

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:55.560
and political elites both before
and after the Islamic revolution

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.950
about the poor quality

00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:01.940
and cultural inauthenticity
of this cinema.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:04.680
Nevertheless millions upon
millions of Iranians went

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.310
to see these films
in the theaters.

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:10.630
They bought fan magazines every
week filled with interviews

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:13.750
and posters of their
favorite film stars.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:15.140
I'll show you a couple of them.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:19.300
So this is Fardin who is maybe
the biggest star of the 1960s

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:23.270
and 1970s on the cover of
one of these fan magazines.

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:28.370
This is Googoosh who is both
a film and pop music star

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:31.750
in the '60s and 1970s and
on the cover of another one

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:34.450
of these film magazines.

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:38.320
And Behrouz Vossoughi who is
perhaps the biggest male star

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:45.390
of the 1970s on the cover of
the same film and art magazine.

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:48.390
Well, the fans would
buy these magazines

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:50.100
from the newsstands every week.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:54.090
They'd obsess over their
favorite stars' personal lives.

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:56.050
They'd send in mountains
of fan letters.

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:57.350
Every one of these --

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:01.260
Every issue of these magazines
would have pages, not one page,

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:05.230
but pages, devoted
to fan letters.

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:07.810
Even in more recent
decades these films

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:10.960
and their stars continue to
have a hold over Iranians

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.180
at home and in the Diaspora.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:18.890
So a few years ago in 2000, in
fact, Mohammad Ali Fardin died,

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:21.910
and his funeral was
held in Tehran.

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:25.540
It was not something that was
widely publicized, but thousands

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:27.930
of people showed
up to this funeral.

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:29.770
And there are some
videos of it circulating

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:31.730
on YouTube if you want to see.

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:34.330
And the most surprising thing to
me is that many of the people,

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:38.830
many of the attendees of this
funeral, were young people,

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:40.300
people that were born well

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:44.930
after these films were ever
released, for that matter.

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:48.330
So we can't assume that the
younger generation is totally

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.660
unaware of the Pahlavi
era of popular cinema.

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:53.630
In fact, these films are
very much in circulation

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:58.030
by satellite television
and home video in Iran

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:59.870
down to the present day.

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:02.830
Nevertheless there's
a very strange culture

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:05.110
of denial surrounding
these films,

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:07.330
especially for a certain
class of Iranians.

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:09.660
And I'm talking about the
educated middle classes

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:10.960
and above.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.220
And that's the reason why
I really became interested

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:14.760
in these films in
the first place.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:17.890
I would ask my family
members about their memories

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:21.110
of the Pahlavi era of popular
cinema, and they would laugh.

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:22.410
And they would say, "No.

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:24.850
No. We never saw
any of those films.

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:27.940
Those movies were for
taxi drivers and porters."

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.240
The uncultured.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.730
The unsophisticated.

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:32.380
But then after a couple
of minutes of talking

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:35.540
with them they would rattle
off the entire plot summaries

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:39.590
of five of their favorite films.

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:42.960
So it made me wonder what
it was about this cinema

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.260
that both attracted

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.940
and seemingly repelled
its audiences.

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:51.770
And this is really
what the book is about.

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:54.530
Well, the popular
commercial film industry

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:57.160
in Iran really has its
start after World War II.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.800
There wasn't much in
the way of film making

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.580
or film going before then.

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:03.510
Government officials
weren't terribly interested

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:07.320
in the cinema as a potential
instrument of state policy.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.150
They were far more concerned
with censorship than they were

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:12.640
with cultivating a
homegrown industry.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:13.940
And, in fact, the few efforts

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.430
that were made before
World War II

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:19.770
to establish a film
industry were blocked

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:22.360
by various government
ministries.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:25.000
So with little in the way
of domestic production,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.220
the growth of cinema
halls was also stunted.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:30.030
I mean right down until
1940 there were no more

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:33.420
than about 35 cinemas
in the entire country.

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:37.930
And what cinemas existed
in Tehran and in a handful

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:41.710
of provincial cities would
show Hollywood films.

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:44.020
Some European titles,
and then increasingly

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:47.610
in the 1930s and'40s
Indian and Egyptian films.

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:49.320
But these films,
none of these films,

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.560
were dubbed in to Persian.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:56.100
The lack of dubbing meant that
film going was largely limited

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:59.640
to foreign residents and
the educated classes.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:03.040
But even if some Iranians
could understand the language,

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.330
for example, of these
western imports,

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:08.830
they might not fully understand
or appreciate the plots

00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:13.730
or the character interactions
in these particular films.

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:16.420
Interestingly Indian and
Egyptian films became a kind

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:20.360
of life saver for many
theater operators at this time.

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.100
And especially the
films of people

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:24.640
like Farid al-Atrash
or [inaudible].

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:30.290
Many, many people went
to watch these movies.

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:32.860
And for the film
exhibitors, as I say,

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:34.250
they were a sort of godsend.

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:37.710
They were much cheaper to
purchase than other films.

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:39.370
Audiences were more
likely to come

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:41.470
and see them in large numbers.

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:42.870
And those audiences, even

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:45.050
if they didn't entirely
understand languages

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:47.350
that the characters
were speaking,

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:49.560
the films themselves
were at least closer

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:54.370
in their cultural sensibilities
to Iranians than many

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:57.440
of the Western films
then in release.

00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:01.340
But after World War II we
have a few individuals,

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:03.720
both inside the country
and outside the country,

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.400
set up studios to dub
foreign films in to Persian.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.840
And most of these dubbing
operations were shoestring

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:14.950
operations that paid very little
for a print of an older film

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:17.450
that was way past
its release date,

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:21.370
and at least initially used
just studio staff to dub

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:24.120
over character voices
in to Persian.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.640
But very quickly these
dubbing operations became more

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.770
sophisticated, and the more
successful outfits would

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:33.560
carefully choose the films
with Iranian audiences in mind.

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:35.830
They came to understand that
in dubbing a film they were

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:37.990
in some sense remaking it.

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:39.290
That their choices would help

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:42.730
to determine its box
office success or failure.

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.870
The choices that the dubbing
studios made might involve

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:48.340
changing names, sometimes
the relationships

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:51.630
between the characters, changing
the dialogue, even editing

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:54.290
or reordering scenes to
better suit the narrative

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:55.590
to Iran sensibilities.

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:57.570
So it wasn't just a
change in language.

00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:59.370
It was a change in the content

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:03.260
that wholly Iranianized
these foreign films.

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:07.850
And perhaps the best example of
these dubbed films in the '50s

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:11.540
and '60s were John
Wayne features.

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:15.460
And, in fact, some of my
relatives have told me

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:18.540
that they can't watch John
Wayne in the original language

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:22.020
because they're so used
to that dubbed over voice

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.320
which was often done in a sort

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.650
of south Tehrani
tough guy dialect.

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:29.640
And so it just sounds strange
to them, strange and alien,

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.350
to listen to John
Wayne's real voice.

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:36.390
And these dubbing efforts could
also extend to film songs.

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:40.930
I mean one of the most famous of
these dubbed American films was

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:45.120
"The Sound of Music"
which was renamed

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:48.040
in Persian [inaudible]
Smiles and Laughter.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.340
I'm sorry.

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:50.640
"Tears and Laughter."

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:56.110
So dubbing, in a sense, became
a sort of intermediary step

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:58.580
to full fledged filmmaking
in Iran,

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:01.190
and many of the local dubbing
studios would eventually make

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:04.060
the leap to producing
their own films.

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:08.290
The term Film Farsi or film
of Farsi, meaning Persian film

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:10.990
or film in Persian, came
to be used by critics,

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:15.100
industry people, and even fans
from the 1950s onwards as a term

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:18.290
of reference for the popular
commercial cinema in Iran.

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:22.470
But before that it was used in
advertisements of dubbed films

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:23.770
to note the replacement

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:27.310
of the film's original
language with Persian.

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:31.090
And the critics who first
popularized this term Film Farsi

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:33.020
in reference to the products

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.980
of the domestic commercial
industry were in a sense trying

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:38.760
to highlight what they believed
to be the negative links

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:42.510
between these homegrown
titles and the dubbed films.

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:46.240
So, in other words, they
claimed that we can't just say

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.960
that the use of the
Persian language

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:51.150
in the dubbing process makes
those foreign films true

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:52.450
to the Iranian.

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:56.050
Neither can we say that domestic
commercial productions are part

00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:59.300
of our national cultural
tradition just

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.470
because they're made
by Iranians.

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:02.770
They are nothing more

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:06.330
than foreign films
starring Iranian actors.

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:10.060
Well, obviously I take exception
to this and other definitions

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.460
of the Film Farsi as
culturally inauthentic.

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:15.790
I mean a major aim of the
book is to demonstrate

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:19.310
that Film Farsi is one of the
few modern art forms in Iran

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:21.830
that has drawn on
the cultural past

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:24.460
to make sense of the present.

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.830
Interestingly the
efforts of intellectuals

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:28.150
and some state organizations,

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:30.140
especially from the
1960s onwards,

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:34.100
to establish what they called a
national cinema often involved

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:36.580
making films that quite
consciously rejected the

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:39.480
stylistic conventions
or narrative techniques

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:43.000
that had come to characterize
the domestic commercial cinema.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.430
Instead this new wave
cinema drew inspiration

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:49.680
from Italian neorealism
and, appropriately enough,

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:52.580
from the French Nouvelle
Vague, two film movements

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.330
that had expressly
pitched themselves

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:57.900
against the popular Hollywood
cinema of their time.

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:01.750
And in its reliance on a post
World War II European art cinema

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:04.920
model to counter
popular tastes at home,

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:08.030
the Iranian new wave wasn't
altogether that different

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:10.960
in its inspiration and
motivation than the art cinemas

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.160
that were emerging roughly
around the same time

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:15.240
in India and in Egypt.

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.010
And ironically I would argue

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:18.450
that the Iranian art
cinema would appear

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:21.420
to have a far murkier provenance

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:24.930
than the popular
cinema in Iran has had.

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:27.790
Certainly there were
some foreign --

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:30.580
some Film Farsi titles
that were nothing more

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:32.940
than cheap knockoffs
of foreign hits,

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:34.720
and especially American ones.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:38.060
But more often than not the
audience recognized that,

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:41.690
and relegated those films
to box office failures.

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:43.650
The problem that I
have with critics

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:45.230
of Film Farsi is their attempt

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:47.590
to treat the post
war commercial cinema

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:49.990
as an undifferentiated mass.

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:53.080
There are informal and
shifting definitions

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.360
of what makes a good film
negotiated by industry people,

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.860
by audiences, throughout
this late Pahlavi era.

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:03.050
And my book focuses on
the so-called good films

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:06.890
that struck a cord with
audiences, and those good films

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:09.540
from my perspective would
appear to be drawing

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:12.970
on older native ideas and
forms of entertainment.

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:16.590
So they were not all
badly made Hollywood films

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:18.590
with just hairier actors.

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:23.650
These were genuinely Iranian
films, as far as I'm concerned.

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:28.580
So Film Farsi became during this
post war period the primary fuel

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:32.390
for the rapid expansion
of film going in Iran.

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:34.950
There was an explosion
of theater construction

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:37.410
in the 1950s and 1960s
across the country.

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:42.620
By 1972 there were more than
400 cinema halls in Iran,

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:45.730
roughly a tenfold
increase in three decades.

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:49.790
And there weren't even enough
prints of the films to screen

00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:51.090
in all of these theaters.

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:54.520
So theater owners would
employ motorcycle couriers

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:58.360
to ferry film reels back and
forth from one cinema to another

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.860
so that the same film could
be shown simultaneously.

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:05.040
In fact, there was a Film Farsi
title that was made about one

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:08.930
of these film motorcycle
couriers.

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:13.150
Well, by contrast, today
there's about 250 cinemas

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:17.150
in the entire country while the
country's population has almost

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:20.070
tripled since the 1970s.

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:21.880
So Film Farsi would seem

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:26.240
to be giving this growing home
audience in Iran something

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.650
that they quite couldn't
get elsewhere.

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:33.540
So let's take a look at some of
the conventions of Film Farsi.

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:36.140
Well, first of all, what I will
say is that it's very difficult

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:38.440
to speak of genres
in Film Farsi.

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.930
I mean obviously in Hollywood
too genre classification can

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:43.230
be problematic.

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:45.720
All you have to do is go on
IMDB and you'll see, you know,

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.050
every film has got three or
four different genres listed

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:49.350
under it.

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:51.860
But with Film Farsi
the operative genres

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:54.700
in Hollywood generally
don't apply.

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.650
It's perhaps easier to
categorize Film Farsi titles

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:01.020
by their place in time much
in the way that critics

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:03.610
and academics have
categorized Japanese cinema

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:05.440
or Indian popular cinema.

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:10.450
So Film Farsi has mythological
stories outside of history,

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:13.650
including episodes from the
so-called Iranian national epic,

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:17.500
"The Shahnameh" or "Book
of Kings" and here's one

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:21.850
of these Film Farsi titles
about a "Shahnameh" episode.

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:24.640
There weren't many
direct adaptations

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:30.000
of mythological tales,
although what I will say is that

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.830
"Shahnameh" themes, narrative
themes, often appear in films

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:36.650
of this period whether
they're about a

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:38.990
"Shahnameh" story or not.

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:41.990
So there are certainly
mythologicals.

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:44.980
There are also historicals
drawing

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:49.160
on the post Islamic history of
Iran and the surrounding world.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:53.460
And so here's one example
of that called [inaudible].

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:58.840
There are perhaps even fewer
examples of the historical

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:00.440
with the censorship regime

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:04.220
at the time playing a major
role in their absence.

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:07.630
Even this film is not
quite a true historical

00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:10.750
in that it's not based on an
actual historical episode,

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:13.200
although it's certainly
set in Iran's past.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.940
I mean specifically in the
years after the collapse

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:18.450
of the Safavid Empire
in the 18th century.

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:21.000
But beyond that the
story is all fictional.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.380
So there are mythologicals.

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:25.680
There are historicals.

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:29.890
But there are also what I
would call socials, sorry,

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:33.410
which are by far the
largest category of films.

00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:36.880
And these films usually
focused on urban family life

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:40.410
in contemporary Iran,
and its problems.

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:42.880
And just as I just suggested,

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:46.680
the socials are themselves not
entirely dissociated in terms

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:49.490
of narrative structure
from the mythologicals

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:50.790
and the historicals.

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:52.980
I mean many of the socials
may be viewed as a sort

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:56.220
of modern reworking
of an older tale.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:59.050
All three of these film
categories have dramatic

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:02.330
elements usually rooted
in some kind of class

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:04.920
or generational conflict
afflicting the social circles

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.780
at the center of the films.

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:09.370
The heroes of the films,
especially those set

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:12.070
in contemporary times,
were more often than not

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:14.500
of a low social status
and even involved

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.530
in petty criminal behavior.

00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:21.250
And these characters were more
often than not also orphans.

00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:25.300
This family handicap helped
to explain, in a sense,

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:26.710
their low social status.

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:29.980
I mean and it's society
where family times

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:34.750
and family honor are or
ironically have become

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:38.060
at this time seemingly
crucial to one's survival.

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:41.970
There's hardly anything
worse than being an orphan.

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:46.180
And the frequent claim that
only taxi drivers and porters

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:49.290
or either the poor and the
working classes watched these

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:53.230
films was related to the class
backgrounds of the film heroes,

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:56.100
and again also questionable
theories

00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:59.700
about audience identification
with the characters.

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:03.430
Of course the problem there is
that the heroic image in Iran

00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:06.650
and in the surrounding world
has for some time been connected

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:10.100
up with figures whose greatest
virtue has been their exclusion

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:13.200
from and opposition
to the social order.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:17.000
And what some would claim
to be its moral hypocrisy.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.220
And those who brought
to life such characters

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:21.000
through public storytelling

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.240
or improvised theatrical
performances were themselves

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.740
marked as social outcasts

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:28.450
because of their lowly
status as entertainers.

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:33.550
So I mean in Iran we have a
category, a social category,

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:37.030
of people that were known
as [inaudible] which comes

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:42.610
from this Quranic reference
to the people of Lot.

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:46.080
The idea being that these
[inaudible] were both socially

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.540
and even sexually deviant.

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:52.840
But at the same time more
often than not they were seen

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:57.550
as paragons of masculinity in
these -- in Iranian society.

00:28:57.550 --> 00:29:00.550
So they have this sort of
strange morally ambiguous,

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:03.280
socially ambiguous
role in society.

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:06.760
Many of them were connected up
with wrestling and wrestlers,

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:10.620
and with the House of
Strength or the Zurkhani,

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:14.170
this traditional
Iranian gymnasium.

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:17.410
And many of these [inaudible]
were not only engaged

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:19.640
in wrestling, but were
also entertainers.

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:22.330
So they were the ones
that put on, for example,

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:26.280
the Ta'zieh performances, this
native theatrical tradition

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:29.600
that is inspired
by the martyrdom

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.540
of the Shia Imam Hussein.

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:34.020
But by the end of
the 19th century,

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:36.590
beginning of the 20th century,
the Ta'zieh had become a sort

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:42.820
of year-round entertainment,
and had also secular topics too,

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:45.010
not just religious ones.

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:48.880
And so what I would argue
is that these young men

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:52.410
of the streets seemingly that
are connected up with wrestling

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:55.540
and entertainment, well
they make the transition

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:58.160
to cinema after World War II.

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.980
They become in a
sense the heroes

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:05.040
of this post war
commercial film industry.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:07.710
And so these older
representations

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:10.970
of heroism then filter in to
Film Farsi along with them.

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:16.960
So at the center of many Film
Farsi titles we have a conflict

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:21.030
between two or more
antagonistic social circles.

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:24.150
And a narrative resolution
is usually achieved

00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:27.280
through the hero's sacrifice
of his own personal happiness

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:30.940
or even personal well being to
preserve the family integrity

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:33.610
of a close friend or a lover.

00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:38.470
And so these are not all
feel good happy films.

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:41.240
They're often tragic
or bittersweet.

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.300
And while the dominant forms

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:46.560
of social organization may
be threatened in these films,

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:48.220
they're not generally
overturned.

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:50.710
In fact, the social
marginality of many

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:52.750
of these Film Farsi
heroes serves

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:55.900
to further highlight their
commitment to the institutions

00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:58.830
of society in which they
seemingly have no stake.

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:01.330
So I mean the very fact that
they're orphans, the very fact

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:05.210
that they're sort of street
toughs living on the margins

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:09.580
of law and society, makes
them all the more --

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:13.160
Their actions, in a
sense, makes the importance

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:14.460
of the family institution

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:18.920
that they don't share even
more important to the audience.

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:21.780
So there's often drama.

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:26.060
There's often tragedy at
the center of these films.

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:29.950
But the drama is often broken up
or thrown in to greater contrast

00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:33.140
with comic elements
and comic interludes.

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:35.520
And these comic moments
don't just lighten the mood,

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:37.950
but they offer some kind
of guarded criticism

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:40.970
of the social order or
highlight the hypocrisy

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:45.130
of certain characters that
the drama ultimately resolves.

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:48.460
Like the dramatic elements, the
kind of indirect comic critique

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:51.820
that we encounter in Film
Farsi titles itself has roots

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:56.000
in older forms of entertainment
in Iran, especially what's known

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.920
as [inaudible] or black farce

00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:00.340
which is not altogether
dissimilar

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:03.060
from the Italian tradition
of Commedia dell'arte.

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:07.630
And particular actors would
specialize in these comic roles

00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:08.930
in the Film Farsi era.

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:12.070
And some of them
came to the cinema

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:15.470
from these older
theatrical traditions.

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:18.700
This is one of the more
famous of the comic sidekicks.

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:20.620
His name is Taghi Zohoori
[assumed spelling].

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:24.560
As I say, I mean he came
from a theatrical background

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:28.620
and then transitioned to cinema.

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:31.850
Well, all three of these film
categories, of mythological,

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:35.800
of historical and social,
could also have song sequences.

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:39.660
And song is often the medium
for communicating the deepest

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:43.510
and most intense emotions of the
characters which certainly draw

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:46.080
on longstanding poetic
traditions in Iran

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.380
and the surrounding world,

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:50.320
especially the "Masnavi"
epic punctuated

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:53.300
by the intense emotions
of the [inaudible] poem.

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:55.300
And the two moods that dominate

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:59.500
in the Film Farsi song
were [inaudible] or despair

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:04.500
and grief, and [inaudible] or
exhilaration and intoxication.

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.700
I want to show you two clips

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:10.690
where this is made
eminently clear.

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:13.430
So the first one we're going
to see is from a film called

00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:16.490
"Raggaseh-ye Shahr"
or "The City Dancer."

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:21.500
Here we have again the
tough guy, the street thug,

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:23.350
as the hero of the film.

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:25.550
This particular tough
guy is played

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:29.680
by a very famous character actor
of the period, Bahman Mofid,

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:33.400
and he's surrounded by these
female cabaret performers

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:36.310
who are sort of the female
equivalent of the tough guy

00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:38.960
in many of these films.

00:33:43.510 --> 00:35:08.390
[ Music ]

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:09.820
&gt;&gt; Doctor Pedram Partovi: Maybe
we've seen enough of this one.

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:17.510
We'll move on to the next one.

00:35:17.510 --> 00:36:03.700
[ Music ]

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:05.340
&gt;&gt; Doctor Pedram Partovi:
In the interest of time,

00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:07.900
I mean obviously that's
definitely a downer compared

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:09.930
to the one that we
just saw before.

00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:12.800
Well, and of course
I mean critics

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:15.640
at the time saved their
most cutting barbs

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:19.640
for the song sequences
in the Film Farsi titles.

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:22.970
From their perspective,
the song served as evidence

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:26.750
of the film's narrative
incoherence or as flimsy covers

00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:29.550
for the film's thin scripts.

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:32.120
Likewise the songs were
supposedly emblematic

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:34.300
of the audience's
short attention spans

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:37.610
which required regular breaks
from the narrative action.

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:40.120
Or were simply shamelessly
pandering

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:43.660
to the simple minded
audience's desire for an escape

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:46.530
from the drudgery of everyday
life in the cinema hall.

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:49.550
And these critiques
were technically correct

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:52.350
in that many song
sequences were a break

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:54.030
from the narrative action.

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:59.950
And did engage, one
might say, in fantasy.

00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:03.700
But in doing so the songs
could also serve as a peek

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:05.280
in to the minds of
the characters

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.580
at the center of them.

00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:11.800
I mean the songs are a chance
for the audience to engage

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:15.970
in voyeurism, in a sense, to
see people's inner thoughts

00:37:15.970 --> 00:37:19.750
and desires in a way that
they otherwise would not.

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:25.770
To see their hopes, their
dreams, their fears, and so on.

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:28.780
Well, certainly for those who
have watched the popular Indian

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:31.910
or Egyptian films of the
same period, there would seem

00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:35.030
to be far more stylistic
and thematic links

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:37.650
that Film Farsi shares
with those industries

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:38.950
than it does with Hollywood.

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:41.310
And for good reason,
as we've seen.

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:44.820
One of the biggest Film
Farsi hits of the 1960s

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:48.720
and 1970s was itself a
parody of Indian cinema,

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:51.310
and of its popularity
in Iran at the time.

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:53.870
And so I want to show
you a couple of clips

00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:56.490
from a film called
"Ganj-e Qarun"

00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:58.730
or "The Treasure of Qarun."

00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:00.550
And this is perhaps
the most famous film

00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:02.860
of this prerevolutionary period.

00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:06.160
And in this particular scene
we have this character Shirin

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.140
who is played by
Forouzan who is again one

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:11.630
of the major female actors
of this period who is sort

00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:16.020
of playing the role of a Hindi
film starlet, we might say.

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:21.940
Okay. To try to seduce Fardin in
this scene, the male character,

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:25.820
the main male character
in this film.

So that didn't work.

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:14.510
She's going to try a
different tack now.

00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:25.480

now she's playing the role

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:28.570
of this tough guy hero.

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:33.510
You can imagine what
his reaction will be.

00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:02.480

The budgets were bigger

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:05.880
for the Egyptian and Indian
films than they were for these.

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:10.510
I mean in Turkey it's not
altogether dissimilar.

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:41.630
&gt;&gt; Doctor Pedram Partovi:
So we'll movie ahead

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:44.030
and again this is another scene
where they're sort of making fun

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:47.120
of the Hindi film,
and of the literacy,

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:49.720
the audience's literacy,
of the Hindi film as well.

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.650
So this is a scene
where again Ali,

00:41:52.650 --> 00:41:55.560
the character we just saw
jumping around in the pool,

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:58.070
is dressed up now
as an Indian price.

00:41:58.070 --> 00:42:01.900
Or he looks more like
[inaudible] than anybody else.

And he's again --
His comic sidekick,

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:06.620
we've seen this guy before.

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:08.390
This is Taghi Zohoori dressed

00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:10.850
up like a British
colonial administrator.

00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:14.610
They're going to meet with
the family, with the parents,

00:42:14.610 --> 00:42:16.930
of the girl that we just saw.

00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:19.280
And he's going to try
to pull off the fact

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:22.550
that he's an Indian prince,
and he's going to do it by sort

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:25.710
of pretending to
speak the language

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:28.210
of the Hindi film, essentially.

&gt;&gt; Doctor Pedram
Partovi: So I mean the --

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:25.470
Maybe I want to conclude
here by very briefly talking

00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:29.450
about what these films had
to say about their own times,

00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:32.610
about the many changes that
Pahlavi era social reforms

00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:36.630
and economic programs were
introducing to people's lives.

00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:38.160
Well, this is a very
complicated topic.

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.650
This is a topic that I go in
to in great detail in the book

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:44.030
that we really can't --
that's very difficult to sum

00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:46.900
up in a brief presentation
like this.

00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:50.730
One thing that I can say is
that Film Farsi and its reliance

00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:54.100
on the cultural past for
its inspiration often stood

00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:56.870
in stark contrast to the
official national culture

00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:59.030
that was being formulated
and promoted

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:03.070
by modernist intellectuals
and politicians of the time.

00:45:03.070 --> 00:45:04.370
But that's not to suggest

00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:08.070
that these films were somehow
foreshadowing a clerically led

00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:10.860
Islamic revolution
which some have claimed

00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:14.390
to be a wholesale rejection
of the modernization programs

00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:15.900
of the Pahlavi regime.

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:19.770
I mean almost immediately after
the revolution many of those

00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:21.810
who were involved in the
commercial film industry

00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:24.190
in the Pahlavi era
were themselves banned

00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:27.570
from taking part in the
revolutionary leadership's plans

00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:31.030
for a remaking of
Iranian cinema.

00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:34.850
The revolutionary leadership saw
Film Farsi, ironically enough,

00:45:34.850 --> 00:45:38.800
as a product of the
corrupt Pahlavi era culture.

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:42.920
And despite the long term
bans on Film Farsi actors,

00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:46.830
on producers, on
directors, fears of a return

00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:50.610
of Film Farsi conventions
and narrative themes

00:45:50.610 --> 00:45:54.520
to the Iranian cinema has become
a vigorous topic of debate

00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:56.660
in media circles
in recent years.

00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:59.210
I mean there are endless
articles published every year

00:45:59.210 --> 00:46:02.040
in the newspapers about
the return of Film Farsi.

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:05.080
So clearly the ideas of
entertainment at the center

00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:08.690
of the films from the
prerevolutionary period have

00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:09.990
retained their relevance,

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:12.520
at least among some
Iranian audiences.

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:15.880
I mean if there's one thing that
we can say about Film Farsi it's

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:18.480
that it has been and
continues to be part

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:21.680
of an alternative national
culture to the one offered

00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:23.210
up by ruling elites,
whether we're talking

00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:27.230
about the Pahlavi era or about
the Islamic Republican era.

00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:31.050
And this is really what the book
is about, about how these films,

00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:34.120
in a sense, are formulating,
putting together,

00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:36.750
an alternative national
culture, an alternative idea

00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:42.680
of the nation itself in
contrast to many of the things

00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:45.910
that Pahlavi era elites
at the time were claiming.

00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:48.280
I think I'll stop right there.

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:51.510

Partovi, thank you very much

00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:03.330
for a wonderful lecture.

00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:06.350
And it's a very fascinating
topic.

00:47:06.350 --> 00:47:10.760
So the question I have for
you is the series of films

00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:17.720
that started to happen late
'70s, things, for example,

00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:21.230
like [inaudible] or [inaudible]
you know, "The Report,"

00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:25.500
and [inaudible] and a number
of things of that sort.

00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:27.220
Some of them are
internationally, you know,

00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:31.520
won awards, but some of them
didn't, but were very different

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:34.240
in -- from the Film Farsi
commercial tradition.

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:37.680
How would you categorize that
genre which is really mid

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:41.000
to late '70s, I think?

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.300
&gt;&gt; Doctor Pedram Partovi: Yeah.

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:45.640
I mean there is what we might
think of as a kind of realist

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:49.160
or hyperrealist art
cinema that appears

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:52.890
in the 1970s in particular.

00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:57.100
Ironically those films are
funded by state organs.

00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:00.230
Doubly ironic is the fact that
most of those films were banned

00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:01.930
from screening in Iran, despite

00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:03.600
that they were funded
by state organs.

00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:08.140
And we have a similar
phenomena after the revolution.

00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:10.450
So I mean many of the
Kiarostami films, for example,

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:12.980
after the revolution are also
funded by the government,

00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:15.140
but never seen inside
the country.

00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:16.860
At least officially.

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:18.750
And so yeah.

00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:20.050
I mean it makes you wonder.

00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:22.120
It makes you wonder, "Well, what
is the intended audience here?"

00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:26.330
What is the objective here
behind these particular films?

00:48:26.330 --> 00:48:29.200
And those films were quite
trenchant in their critique

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:34.430
of social ills in society,
especially one film

00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:38.260
that especially comes to mind
is "Mina's Cycle" which was

00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:44.750
about heroine addiction in Iran
in the prerevolutionary period.

00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:51.230
But yes. I mean those films
at some level were too dark,

00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:55.350
and too depressing, in a sense,
for audiences to go and see

00:48:55.350 --> 00:48:58.610
in large numbers even
if they were allowed

00:48:58.610 --> 00:49:01.010
to be screened in the cinemas.

00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:05.170
I mean these films have tragic
moments, but they're more about,

00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:10.550
in a sense, validating --
reinforcing a particular idea

00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:15.060
of family life that the
modern middle classes

00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:17.360
in the Pahlavi era
believed to be

00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:19.450
at the center of national life.

00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:23.220
And this was, at some level,
in contrast to, at odds with,

00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:27.170
what Pahlavi officials at the
time were trying to claim.

00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:31.090
That what we're trying to create
here is a modern society that's,

00:49:31.090 --> 00:49:34.440
you know, formed on --
along western lines.

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:38.010
And so the exemplary
citizen is the individual.

00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:41.890
The exemplary citizen is
one that's not beholden

00:49:41.890 --> 00:49:48.580
by family ties that, you know,
drag him down, in a sense.

00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:53.400
I mean this is, you know --
We're very in sociology really

00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:56.300
at its core that becomes crucial

00:49:56.300 --> 00:50:00.120
to the Pahlavi vision
of Iranian society.

00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:03.500
But it's the one that most
people don't buy in to.

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:05.100
It's one that I'm not
entirely convinced

00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:07.160
that the Pahlavi
regime itself bought

00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:09.280
in to, to be quite honest.

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:12.180
And so we have these
films that are evidence

00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:13.830
of that, I think in many ways.

00:50:13.830 --> 00:50:16.280
And this is what the draw of
these particular films were,

00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:21.730
more than anything
else, I think.

00:50:21.730 --> 00:50:23.660
Yes? Right.

00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:25.510
Right.

00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:57.920
[ Inaudible ]

00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:59.460
Well, I mean I -- Yeah.

00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:00.760
I mean I think that that

00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:03.090
in itself is also
evidence of the audience.

00:51:03.090 --> 00:51:07.090
With that question, the answer
to that question also feeds

00:51:07.090 --> 00:51:10.240
in to or provides evidence for
the audience of these films.

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:13.290
I mean many of the people that
were engaged in that cinema,

00:51:13.290 --> 00:51:15.820
were behind the camera,
in a sense were also part

00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:17.700
of the educated middle classes.

00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:20.560
Right. And they were
making films, by and large,

00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:21.860
for the educated middle classes.

00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:23.400
I mean if we think
that, you know --

00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:28.010
Who has the time and
the disposal income,

00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:30.260
for that matter, to go
and watch these movies?

00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:32.520
Certainly not taxi
drivers and porters.

00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:33.940
Right. Right.

00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:40.320
So, as I say, I mean it's --
It may seem strange on its face

00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:42.740
that we don't have middle
class characters, by and large,

00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:46.160
as the central focus of
these particular films,

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:49.160
but I think that's part of what
I would argue to be the sort

00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:52.310
of counter narrative that
these films are offering

00:51:52.310 --> 00:51:55.750
to the official narrative
of the state at the time.

00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:59.140
That sees, in fact, the
educated middle classes,

00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:00.740
and in particular
the civil servant,

00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:02.950
as the exemplary citizen.

00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:06.410
Well, I defy you to find a civil
servant in any of these films.

00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:07.710
It doesn't exist.

00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:09.010
It doesn't exist.

00:52:09.010 --> 00:52:11.300
I defy you to find a police
presence, for that matter,

00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:12.880
in any of these films.

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:14.180
They don't exist either.

00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:17.480
You know? I mean it's all street
justice more often than not

00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:19.440
that defines these
particular films.

00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:20.960
So, as I say, I mean it's part

00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:23.220
of the sort of counter
narrative.

00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:26.260
On its face you may
come immediately

00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:29.270
to the assumption that, well,
because it's all about the poor

00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:31.200
and working classes, then
it must be that the poor

00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:33.770
and working classes are watching
these films, but as I say,

00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:37.120
I mean historically
entertainers were

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:39.290
from the poor and
working classes.

00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:43.150
So it was no different in the
cinema as it was in the theater

00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:45.960
that preceded it in that regard.

00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:48.930
That's why I say, I mean, these
films are very, very much a part

00:52:48.930 --> 00:52:51.040
of Iran's cultural history.

00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:53.240
Right. Oh, yes.

00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:54.540
Absolutely.

00:52:54.540 --> 00:53:02.070
I mean so, for example, the
guy that made this film.

00:53:02.070 --> 00:53:04.750
Right. Absolutely.

00:53:04.750 --> 00:53:08.790
Yeah. I mean so the guy
that directed this film,

00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:13.010
Siamak Yasemi, well, first
of all, he comes from a very,

00:53:13.010 --> 00:53:16.910
very learned Iranian family.

00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:20.030
He spoke several languages,
including Hindi and Urdu.

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:21.970
He spent many, many
years in India.

00:53:21.970 --> 00:53:25.680
He had a degree, a university
degree, in Persian literature.

00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:28.560
So I mean they know all
of this stuff, in a sense.

00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:31.300
And again that's what makes
all these films so strange,

00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:35.080
as I say, on their face, because
they've been completely ignored.

00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:37.200
They've been seen as
culturally inauthentic,

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:38.710
but in many ways they're not.

00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:40.610
From my perspective.

00:53:40.610 --> 00:53:43.510
Yeah.

00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:57.370
[ Inaudible ]

00:53:57.370 --> 00:53:58.670
Well, yeah.

00:53:58.670 --> 00:54:01.170
I mean I don't know if there
was some attempt to sort

00:54:01.170 --> 00:54:03.080
of create a national unity

00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:06.860
that the Pahlavi officials
weren't accomplishing.

00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:09.430
As I say, I mean I
think the main reason

00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:11.860
that we have lower class
heroes in these films is

00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:14.140
because historically,
traditionally,

00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:15.440
that's what they were.

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:17.900
Yeah. I mean again, and
not just the entertainers,

00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:21.330
but I mean most of the
modern social movements

00:54:21.330 --> 00:54:24.880
in Iran have been led by
these kinds of figures too.

00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:27.940
By these lower class figures,
these toughs of the street,

00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:30.570
toughs, the gangsters
of the streets.

00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:33.420
And they've always had this
sort of morally ambiguous role.

00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:38.300
So one day they could be, you
know, clubbing their neighbors

00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:41.760
on the head for protesting
in the streets,

00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:46.610
and the next day they could
be leading the protest.

00:54:46.610 --> 00:54:48.450
So they've always had this
sort of complicated role

00:54:48.450 --> 00:54:50.870
within society, and we see
that in these films too.

00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:53.130
I mean more often than
not we see both poles

00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:59.230
of this [inaudible] character,
the mercenary elements of them

00:54:59.230 --> 00:55:03.490
and of course also the pious and
socially justice minded elements

00:55:03.490 --> 00:55:09.630
of them too or the public
spirited elements of them too.

00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:11.430
Yes?

00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:51.130
[ Inaudible ]

00:55:51.130 --> 00:55:52.970
Well, I mean again -- Right.

00:55:52.970 --> 00:55:55.740
Right. Well, for
the first question,

00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:57.410
in terms of the ratings system,

00:55:57.410 --> 00:56:00.890
there was a very
rudimentary one, we might say.

00:56:00.890 --> 00:56:04.180
I mean films were
rated by country

00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:08.430
of origin at the first level.

00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:12.460
So, you know, if it was a
Western film or European film,

00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:15.190
an American film, only
those films, for example --

00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:17.060
Mostly those films, for example,

00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:20.570
were shown in the
first class theaters.

00:56:20.570 --> 00:56:23.410
And Indian and Iranian
films were, by and large,

00:56:23.410 --> 00:56:26.000
shown in the second and the
third class cinemas generally

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.300
during this period of time.

00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:31.670
So there was a sort of
government ratings system

00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:33.090
for the theaters themselves,

00:56:33.090 --> 00:56:34.620
and that determined how
much they could charge

00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:37.030
for ticket prices and so on.

00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:40.240
So that also explains
the production qualities

00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:41.590
of these particular films too.

00:56:41.590 --> 00:56:44.730
And so they were getting less
in terms of ticket revenues

00:56:44.730 --> 00:56:47.630
and so the films had smaller
budgets than, let's say,

00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:50.360
an American Hollywood
production.

00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:55.500
And then again towards
the 1970s we also get age

00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:57.290
restrictions too.

00:56:57.290 --> 00:57:01.020
So in the 1970s we get
increasingly what we might think

00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:06.320
of as films with, you know,
definite erotic themes,

00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:08.500
sexually suggestive themes.

00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:11.020
Even nudity, for that matter.

00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:13.120
Both Iranian and foreign.

00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:16.810
And yes. There were age
restrictions that were put

00:57:16.810 --> 00:57:20.520
in place to keep people
under the age of 18

00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:23.140
out of those particular
showings.

00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:25.800
But it wasn't quite as
complicated a system

00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:27.100
as we have in the United States.

00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:28.580
And of course I mean
the ratings system

00:57:28.580 --> 00:57:31.600
in the United States really only
dates back to the late 1960s.

00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:32.990
I mean this is not
something that was there

00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:34.550
from the very, very beginning.

00:57:34.550 --> 00:57:38.650
And of course there were always
limits on what you could do,

00:57:38.650 --> 00:57:40.080
especially for Iranian films.

00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:41.680
There was always limits
on what you could do.

00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:45.280
So I mean you couldn't show

00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:49.780
or even stimulate sexual
intercourse on screen.

00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:51.940
Kissing was perfectly
acceptable,

00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:54.090
but I mean if you've seen,
for example, Indian films

00:57:54.090 --> 00:57:55.390
of the same period, even

00:57:55.390 --> 00:57:57.430
that wasn't acceptable
for those films.

00:57:57.430 --> 00:58:02.080
And so at some level
people flocked

00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:03.380
to Iranian films precisely

00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:06.330
because of what the Indian films
didn't show, and people flocked

00:58:06.330 --> 00:58:07.630
to Indian films precisely

00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:08.930
because of what the
Indian films showed

00:58:08.930 --> 00:58:11.690
that the Iranian films
didn't, for that matter.

00:58:11.690 --> 00:58:13.950
So they're sort of working
together in that sense.

00:58:13.950 --> 00:58:16.340
I mean if you watch the Iranian
films you probably watched a lot

00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:18.310
of the Indian films too.

00:58:18.310 --> 00:58:20.910
It was a shared audience in
many ways or at least a lot

00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:23.690
of audience overlap between
these two film forms.

00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:29.270
Was that all of the
questions that you're -- Oh.

00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:31.200
And then post revolution.

00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:32.500
Right. Right.

00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:34.300
Right. Well, no.

00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:36.980
I mean obviously since
the revolution the idea

00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:42.950
of an unrelated man and a woman
sharing any kind of intimacy

00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:47.390
on screen, even touching
one another, is off limits.

00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:49.800
I mean they figured out
ways to get around this.

00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:52.420
So I mean one of my favorites
is I was watching one Iranian

00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:57.140
television show where a son is
coming back from the war front,

00:58:57.140 --> 00:58:59.910
and his mother is sitting
on the couch waiting for him

00:58:59.910 --> 00:59:01.210
to come back from the war front.

00:59:01.210 --> 00:59:02.520
Well, you would imagine the
first thing that they're going

00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:04.000
to do once their son arrives

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.860
at the front door is
hug and kiss each other.

00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:09.150
And they show that.

00:59:09.150 --> 00:59:10.790
But they don't.

00:59:10.790 --> 00:59:16.910
So the scene begins with the
camera pointed at the back

00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:19.360
of the head of the mother
sitting on the couch.

00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:20.930
The doorbell rings.

00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:22.230
She gets up.

00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:23.530
The camera remains stationary.

00:59:23.530 --> 00:59:26.090
But we can hear the interaction.

00:59:26.090 --> 00:59:27.460
We can hear them
kissing each other.

00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:29.520
We can hear them
hugging each other.

00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:30.820
So there are these kinds

00:59:30.820 --> 00:59:33.880
of limitations unfortunately
since the revolution.

00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:35.260
And of course, as
you might imagine,

00:59:35.260 --> 00:59:36.560
these films are completely
banned.

00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:38.790
You cannot watch
these movies legally.

00:59:38.790 --> 00:59:40.090
But that doesn't mean
that people don't.

00:59:40.090 --> 00:59:43.850
I mean by the government's own
admission, something like 70%

00:59:43.850 --> 00:59:47.820
of the population has access
to a satellite television dish.

00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:49.420
Even though that's illegal.

00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:52.050
I'm sorry?

00:59:52.050 --> 00:59:56.350
Well, I mean there are
peddlers in the streets

00:59:56.350 --> 00:59:57.750
that sell these movies.

00:59:57.750 --> 01:00:02.170
Yeah. I mean again you have
these wide honking boulevards

01:00:02.170 --> 01:00:05.090
all over Tehran, and of
course nobody's trying --

01:00:05.090 --> 01:00:06.720
People do try to cross them.

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.770
Pedestrians do try to
cross these streets.

01:00:08.770 --> 01:00:11.040
But you're really taking
your life in to your hands

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:12.340
if you try to do such a thing.

01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:15.970
So they built all of
these sky bridges that go

01:00:15.970 --> 01:00:18.700
over these boulevards.

01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:22.000
And the peddler sits in the
middle of the sky bridge.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.620
Nobody sees him.

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:27.680
And he can sell his wares from
there, and you know thousands

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:29.670
of people pass him by every day.

01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:34.460
There's a huge sort of
market in underground films.

01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:37.970
Yeah.

01:00:37.970 --> 01:00:47.840
[ Inaudible ]

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:49.140
Absolutely.

01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:51.020
Yeah. So I mean via satellite
television they're also watching

01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:52.720
these movies.

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:57.060
There are 1,000 Persian language
satellite networks now set

01:00:57.060 --> 01:01:01.060
up with a couple hundred
dollars and a small studio

01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:04.210
in Los Angeles, in
London, in Dubai,

01:01:04.210 --> 01:01:06.460
and they don't show
the art films.

01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:08.530
They show these films.

01:01:08.530 --> 01:01:11.570
So everybody in Iran knows this
cinema even if they weren't born

01:01:11.570 --> 01:01:16.790
when it was released,
for that matter.

01:01:16.790 --> 01:01:19.470
So yes. I mean despite
the ban, many,

01:01:19.470 --> 01:01:23.960
many people are still
watching these movies.

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:26.510
Right. Right.

01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:36.360
[ Inaudible ]

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:39.690
Very few sci fi and monster
for reasons that we've sort

01:01:39.690 --> 01:01:43.170
of talked about because those
films require special effects.

01:01:43.170 --> 01:01:44.560
It's expensive.

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:46.680
Most of these films
were made with very,

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:49.360
very little money,
very, very quickly.

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:52.820
So we don't get much
in the way of sci fi.

01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:55.620
Not much in the way
of horror films.

01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:59.110
We do get -- I mean one of
the genres that sort of pops

01:01:59.110 --> 01:02:03.520
up in the 1950s in the United
States or reappears all

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.600
around the world, an American
genre that reappears all

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:08.090
around the world, is film noir.

01:02:08.090 --> 01:02:12.140
So we do get some film noir
being made in the 1950s in Iran

01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:14.930
by the director of
this particular film.

01:02:14.930 --> 01:02:18.180
Okay. An Armenian guy by the
name of Samuel Khachikian.

01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:23.330
Okay. And he made a lot of sort
of film noir films in the 1950s.

01:02:23.330 --> 01:02:26.270
So there were sort
of odd attempts made

01:02:26.270 --> 01:02:31.660
by a few characters to
make films along western

01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:33.050
generic lines.

01:02:33.050 --> 01:02:37.420
But, you know, few and
far between, we might say.

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:40.270
Yeah. Right.

01:02:40.270 --> 01:02:42.510
Exactly. Yeah.

01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:47.220
[ Inaudible ]

01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:51.380
Well, I mean, you know,
sometimes you watch one

01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:54.980
of these movies on the satellite
network in Iran and half

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:57.140
of the screen is
covered with logos

01:02:57.140 --> 01:03:00.320
because they've taken a bootleg
version of a bootleg version.

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:02.590
And by the time it gets
down to them, you know,

01:03:02.590 --> 01:03:07.080
you can hardly see what's
going on on screen anymore.

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:09.380
Yes.

01:03:10.510 --> 01:05:03.980
[ Inaudible ]

01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:06.880
Well, I mean the
middle class is new.

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:08.980
It's new everywhere in
this part of the world.

01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:11.060
And so how do you
distinguish yourself?

01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:12.360
How do you differentiate
yourself

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:14.570
from everybody else, in a sense?

01:05:14.570 --> 01:05:16.350
And culture is one way.

01:05:16.350 --> 01:05:18.770
So these movies aren't for us.

01:05:18.770 --> 01:05:21.800
They're -- And you get
this kind of cultural --

01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:23.790
culture of denial precisely
because they're trying

01:05:23.790 --> 01:05:27.020
to differentiate themselves
from their class backgrounds,

01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:29.190
what were once upon a time
their class backgrounds.

01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:30.490
Yes. No doubt.

01:05:30.490 --> 01:05:32.530
No doubt.

01:05:32.530 --> 01:05:34.310
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: Thank
you everyone for joining us.

01:05:34.310 --> 01:05:38.350
I just want to put a plug
in for the collection

01:05:38.350 --> 01:05:41.760
at the library speaking
of this period's films.

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:46.980
About eight years ago the
[inaudible] division we bought

01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:53.670
about 100 plus of all the
available films' DVDs format

01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:56.130
from this period
for the library.

01:05:56.130 --> 01:05:57.430
And it's being held

01:05:57.430 --> 01:06:00.080
in the motion picture
broadcasting division.

01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:04.340
So we have a number of these
Film Farsi genre over there

01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:05.920
in the library's collection.

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:08.000
Thank you, Doctor
Partovi, for coming out.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.460
Wonderful presentation.

01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:10.960
Thanks to everyone who came.

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:12.660

been a presentation

01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:14.640
