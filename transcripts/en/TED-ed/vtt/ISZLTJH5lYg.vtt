00:00:06.828 --> 00:00:11.292
A, C, E, D, B, K.

00:00:11.292 --> 00:00:14.600
No, this isn't some random,
out of order alphabet.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.092
These are vitamins,
and just like letters build words,

00:00:18.092 --> 00:00:21.903
they're the building blocks
that keep the body running.

00:00:21.903 --> 00:00:25.519
Vitamins are organic compounds we need
to ingest in small amounts

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:27.598
to keep functioning.

00:00:27.598 --> 00:00:31.010
They're the body's builders, defenders
and maintenance workers,

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.200
helping it to build muscle and bone,
make use of nutrients,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.820
capture and use energy
and heal wounds.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.243
If you need convincing about
vitamin value,

00:00:40.243 --> 00:00:43.279
just consider the plight of 
olden day sailors,

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:46.599
who had no access to vitamin-rich
fresh produce.

00:00:46.599 --> 00:00:48.018
They got scurvy.

00:00:48.018 --> 00:00:50.691
But vitamin C,
abundant in fruits and vegetables,

00:00:50.691 --> 00:00:53.504
was the simple antidote to this disease.

00:00:53.504 --> 00:00:57.062
While bacteria, fungi and plants
produce their own vitamins,

00:00:57.062 --> 00:01:01.468
our bodies can't, so we have to get
them from other sources.

00:01:01.468 --> 00:01:05.131
So how does the body get
vitamins from out there into here?

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:08.379
That's dependent on the form
these compounds take.

00:01:08.379 --> 00:01:09.920
Vitamins come in two types:

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.371
lipid-soluble and 
water-soluble,

00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:14.933
and the difference between them 
determines how the body

00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:19.252
transports and stores vitamins, 
and gets rid of the excess.

00:01:19.252 --> 00:01:21.739
The water-solubles are vitamin C

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:25.615
and B Complex vitamins that are made up of
eight different types

00:01:25.615 --> 00:01:27.410
that each do something unique.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.532
These are dissolved in the watery parts
of fruits, vegetables and grains,

00:01:31.532 --> 00:01:35.090
meaning their passage through the body
is relatively straightforward.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.659
Once inside the system,
these foods are digested

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.626
and the vitamins within them are
taken up directly by the bloodstream.

00:01:41.626 --> 00:01:43.876
Because blood plasma is water-based,

00:01:43.876 --> 00:01:48.194
water-soluble vitamins C and B have their
transport cut out for them

00:01:48.194 --> 00:01:50.867
and can move around freely 
within the body.

00:01:50.867 --> 00:01:53.668
For lipid-soluble vitamins,
dissolved in fat

00:01:53.668 --> 00:01:56.933
and found in foods like diary,
butter and oils,

00:01:56.933 --> 00:01:59.951
this trip into the blood is a little
more adventurous.

00:01:59.951 --> 00:02:02.938
These vitamins make it through
the stomach and the intestine,

00:02:02.938 --> 00:02:06.423
where an acidic substance
called bile flows in from the liver,

00:02:06.423 --> 00:02:11.133
breaking up the fat and preparing it for
absorption through the intestinal wall.

00:02:11.133 --> 00:02:14.943
Because fat-soluble vitamins can't make
use of the blood's watery nature,

00:02:14.943 --> 00:02:17.338
they need something else 
to move them around,

00:02:17.338 --> 00:02:21.740
and that comes from proteins that attach
to the vitamins and act like couriers,

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.314
transporting fat-solubles into the blood
and around the body.

00:02:26.314 --> 00:02:29.708
So, this difference between water-
or fat-soluble vitamins

00:02:29.708 --> 00:02:31.913
determines how they get into the blood,

00:02:31.913 --> 00:02:35.401
but also how they're stored 
or rejected from the body.

00:02:35.401 --> 00:02:38.443
The system's ability to circulate
water-soluble vitamins

00:02:38.443 --> 00:02:40.100
in the bloodstream so easily

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.156
means that most of them can be passed
out equally easily via the kidneys.

00:02:45.156 --> 00:02:47.725
Because of that, 
most water-soluble vitamins

00:02:47.725 --> 00:02:51.897
need to be replenished on a daily basis
through the food we eat.

00:02:51.897 --> 00:02:54.636
But fat-soluble vitamins have
staying power

00:02:54.636 --> 00:02:58.464
because they can be packed into the liver
and in fat cells.

00:02:58.464 --> 00:03:00.642
The body treats these parts like a pantry,

00:03:00.642 --> 00:03:04.274
storing the vitamins there and rationing
them out when needed,

00:03:04.274 --> 00:03:06.772
meaning we shouldn't overload
on this type of vitamin

00:03:06.772 --> 00:03:09.674
because the body is generally 
well stocked.

00:03:09.674 --> 00:03:12.642
Once we figured the logistics
of transport and storage,

00:03:12.642 --> 00:03:16.513
the vitamins are left to do the work
they came here to do in the first place.

00:03:16.513 --> 00:03:20.510
Some, like many of the B Complex vitamins,
make up coenzymes,

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.848
whose job it is to help enzymes 
release the energy from food.

00:03:24.848 --> 00:03:28.271
Other B vitamins then help the body
to use that energy.

00:03:28.271 --> 00:03:32.793
From vitamin C, you get the ability to
fight infection and make collagen,

00:03:32.793 --> 00:03:37.568
a kind of tissue that forms 
bones and teeth and heals wounds.

00:03:37.568 --> 00:03:41.767
Vitamin A helps make white blood cells,
key in the body's defense,

00:03:41.767 --> 00:03:47.666
helps shape bones and improves vision 
by keeping the cells of the eye in check.

00:03:47.666 --> 00:03:51.549
Vitamin D gathers calcium and phosphorus 
so we can make bones,

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.429
and vitamin E works as an antioxidant,

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:57.767
getting rid of elements in the body
that can damage cells.

00:03:57.767 --> 00:04:01.568
Finally, from Vitamin K, we score
the ability to clot blood,

00:04:01.568 --> 00:04:04.369
since it helps make the proteins
that do this job.

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:06.338
Without this vitamin variety,

00:04:06.338 --> 00:04:10.147
humans face deficiencies that 
cause a range of problems,

00:04:10.147 --> 00:04:13.036
like fatigue, nerve damage, 
heart disorders,

00:04:13.036 --> 00:04:15.956
or diseases like rickets and scurvy.

00:04:15.956 --> 00:04:19.489
On the other hand, too much of any
vitamin can cause toxicity in the body,

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.841
so there goes the myth that loading
yourself with supplements is a great idea.

00:04:23.841 --> 00:04:26.431
In reality, it's all about getting the
balance right,

00:04:26.431 --> 00:04:28.814
and hitting that vitamin jackpot.
