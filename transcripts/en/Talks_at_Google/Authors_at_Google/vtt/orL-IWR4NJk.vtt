00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.840
CHADE-MENG TAN: Good afternoon
my friends.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.470
So in 2007 we started a program
called "Search Inside

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.610
Yourself," and as we were
looking around the room we

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.300
decided that we needed somebody
very special.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.030
So, to create this class, or
to bring this class to the

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.540
next level, let's look for a
business leader, an executive.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.160
Let's look for somebody with
10,000 hours of meditation

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:34.160
training and is a respected
meditation teacher; and has

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.610
experience running
a business--

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.170
a successful business;
preferably a CEO--

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.540
preferably a founding CEO; and
preferably is a top leader;

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.960
preferably an author of business
books; and has an

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.670
MBA; and is willing
to work with us.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.900
So, hmm.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.700
Does this person even
exist in the world?

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.350
And we were very fortunate
that we found him, Marc,

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.040
today's guest.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.340
And he was right there.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.240
Because we had already started
working with him as a

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.430
coach at that time.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.440
And it was, this is it.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.550
He's the guy we've
been looking for.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.580
So we're very lucky
to have him, Marc.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.860
And Marc is here to talk about
his book, [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.270
This book, his third book,
and in my opinion

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.980
his best book yet.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.930
And this is a book about
paradoxes, except it is not,

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:30.323
paradoxically.

00:01:30.323 --> 00:01:32.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.790
And it's about paradoxes leading
you to a happier, more

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.140
successful life.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.004
And with that, my friend
Marc Lesser.

00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:47.810
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.830
MARC LESSER: Thank
you and welcome.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.030
Someone just asked me,
what's the meaning?

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.340
Or where did they come up with
the title of this book, "Know

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.330
Yourself, Forget Yourself." I
had to admit that I stole the

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.580
title from the words of
a 13th century Zen

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.560
teacher named Dogen.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.680
Actually Dogen was the founder
of Zen in Japan, and a very

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.000
prolific, very wonderful
teacher.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.630
And one of his most known
expressions, in fact it's so

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.110
well known that I once
published it

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.210
as a greeting card--

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.270
I used to run a publishing
company that

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.550
made greeting cards.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:34.020
And this quote by Dogen says "to
study the way is to study

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.190
the self; to study the self is
to forget the self and to

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.930
forget the self is to awaken, or
to become enlightened with

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.940
everything and everyone." And I
first heard that expression

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.210
probably about 40 years ago,
and I've been mulling that

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.690
expression for much
of my life.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:58.620
What does it mean?

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.510
What does it mean to
study yourself?

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.870
What does it mean to
know yourself?

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.320
What does it mean and how does
that lead to self knowing?

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.890
And how does that lead to
becoming someone who can be

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.510
truly effective, influential
and powerful in the world?

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.170
I want to start with a Zen
story, one of my favorite Zen

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.460
stories, which is
about a funeral.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:34.290
This is a story about these two
Zen teachers who decide to

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.430
go to a, they're going
to a funeral.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.540
And they get there early,
and they noticed that

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.610
no one else is there.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.600
And they see a coffin, a coffin
that has the body of

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.060
the deceased friend of theirs.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.960
And you never know what to
expect when you get the Zen

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.290
guys together.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.480
So these two Zen teachers go
walking, they go right up to

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.710
the coffin.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.450
And one of them raps his
hand on the coffin,

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.440
knocks on the coffin.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.270
Imagine if you were one
of these people.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.260
And he looks at the
other teacher and

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.350
says "alive or dead?

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.950
Alive or dead?" And the other
teacher, without hesitating,

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:25.220
looks at him and says "I won't
say, I won't say." So this is

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.320
a story about the things we take
for granted, about what

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.300
does it mean to be alive.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.350
What does it mean to be a
fully alive human being?

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.050
And what is this thing that
we call life and death?

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.690
And that it's a paradox.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.870
Everything about being a human
being, I think when we stop to

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.760
look a little bit more
carefully and more

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.840
closely, is a paradox.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.610
So breathing in and
breathing out.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.560
So I sometimes when I'm teaching
meditation, and maybe

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.170
we can all practice this a
little bit even while we're

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.430
right here, so breathing in
is a kind of self knowing;

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.540
breathing in, kind of know some

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.610
sense of what's happening.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.680
What's happening with
you right now?

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.140
What are you feeling?

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.540
Who are you?

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.660
What do you think it
means to be you?

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.870
And as you breathe out,
letting it go.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.240
Like just forgetting,
forgetting it all.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.330
Completely refreshing,
completely refreshing

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.010
yourself; that you can actually
use the breath and do

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.310
this with every breath.

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:43.250
So it's self knowing and self
forgetting, self knowing and

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.500
self forgetting.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.740
As I was writing this book, this
book came as somewhat of

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.830
a surprise to me.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.560
My last book was called "Less.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.800
Accomplishing More by Doing
Less." I signed a contract to

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.880
write another book.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.290
And the contract I signed
was to write a book

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.970
called "More", obviously.

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:20.680
Because I felt like a lot of
people had, a lot of people

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.640
liked "Less", but every once in
awhile I would meet CEOs of

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.790
companies who would say, "I
really love this book "Less".

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.000
You've done such a great job,
but I'm not giving it to any

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.100
of my employees because I don't
want them doing less."

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:41.110
And I realized he totally
didn't get it.

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:42.990
"Less" isn't about doing less.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:49.020
Less is about getting more done
by being more effective,

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.310
more present.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.300
And that was the beginning
of thinking I need to

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.130
straighten this out.

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.510
I need to write a book that is
clear about, that it needs to

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.330
be a book about more.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.160
So I signed this contract for
a book called "More."

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.090
And I started down this
road of writing

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.270
a book called "More".

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:09.690
And what kept coming
up for me was how

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.180
paradoxical everything was.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:18.260
That everything about my life,
when I looked at my life as a

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.340
business person, as someone who
was working in the world

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.830
as an executive coach, as a
CEO, as someone who was

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:30.260
working with business people,
and at the same time I'm also

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.480
a Zen teacher.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.700
I thought, just that.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.420
How paradoxical is that?

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.770
Just my own definitions
of myself.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:41.700
But all of the work, when I felt
like I'd be in front of a

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:46.620
CEO of a company, what kept
coming up for me was working

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.450
in the realm of paradox.

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:54.800
How do you actually practice
with things like confidence

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.510
and questioning?

00:07:56.510 --> 00:08:00.700
How do you actually work with
things like fighting for

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.870
change and accepting what is?

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:09.610
I noticed even just
those two themes--

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:13.460
being confident and questioning
everything,

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.770
fighting for change and
accepting what is.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:22.260
Those two paradoxes I've noticed
were mainstays of my

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.850
coaching practice as well as
my Zen teaching practice.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:33.200
And then there was this
emotional paradox about, over

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.280
and over again as I work in the
realm of teaching people

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:43.020
about emotional intelligence, it
became clear that the idea

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.430
wasn't about tamping down
one's emotions.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:50.030
In fact, the practice is about
becoming completely free in

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.340
your own emotional life.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.250
Learning to trust your emotions,
and be a completely

00:08:54.250 --> 00:09:00.240
emotional being and at the same
time to find a sense of

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.330
equanimity.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:07.750
So this became another core
paradox, was embrace emotion

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:09.465
and embody equanimity.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:17.810
And then this other paradox kept
coming up about, wait a

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:21.240
minute-- do we take
care of ourselves?

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.910
How do we take care
of ourselves?

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:27.020
What does real well-being
practice mean?

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:34.080
What does it mean to eat well
and exercise and really take

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.150
good care of ourselves, and at
the same time I thought that

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:41.940
our lives were supposed to be
about benefiting others.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:46.230
So this became another one of
these core paradoxes, the

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:51.240
paradox of benefit others
and benefit yourself.

00:09:54.590 --> 00:10:00.830
So one morning as this book was
starting to take shape, I

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.390
remember one morning in
particular, I was getting up

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:06.140
at about 3:00 or 3:30
AM to write.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:10.190
Because at one point it just
really grabbed me, the subject

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:13.900
about paradox and how to bring
paradox into the world, and

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:19.970
how important it is to actually
identify, embrace and

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.000
practice with paradox.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.060
So this book is about the
importance and practices for

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:34.870
how to, not only not push away
paradox, but how to embody it,

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:38.780
embrace it, and how to practice
with paradox.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.690
That the practice of paradox,
I think, might be one of the

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:46.600
most important and core
practices for human beings.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:51.660
And one morning as I sat down to
write, I noticed I started

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.680
to feel agitated and
almost angry.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:59.960
And I found myself writing I
don't want this book to be

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.630
about paradox.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:03.690
I don't like paradox.

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:06.900
I want this book to
be about clarity.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:10.920
And I want to read you, this is
partly what when I started

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.100
to write that morning.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.720
Personally speaking I'm not
happy or satisfied with the

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.970
idea of paradox.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:22.280
I don't really want this book
to be about paradox.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.880
I want this book to
be about clarity.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.850
Who wants paradoxical
relationships

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:31.280
or paradox in business?

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.770
We all want confidence
and assurance.

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:38.060
Imagine a stockbroker, surgeon,
or soldier using the

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:41.080
word paradox to describe
his or her work.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:44.500
Paradox seems to be the
opposite of clarity.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.420
The opposite of action.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:47.980
A non-answer.

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.940
Perhaps a shrug.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.640
In my work life and personal
life I've come to realize that

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:59.680
embracing what is obvious
is not always so easy.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:05.350
Meanwhile paradox can point
to a radical clarity.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:09.450
My hope is that this book will
help you see that with paradox

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:14.900
comes a kind of clarity that is
more accurate, more true,

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:18.400
more clear than clear.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:22.310
I see that as I was writing
this, that line really

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:23.740
surprised me.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:28.490
That with paradox comes the kind
of clarity that is more

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:32.870
accurate, more true, more clear
than clear, than what we

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:36.090
usually accept at face value.

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:39.530
Life and death are a paradox.

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:43.550
In our day-to-day lives we're
constantly torn between

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:49.940
opposites and duality, between
competing desires and needs.

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:52.280
There is no escaping
the paradoxical

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.580
nature of the world.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:59.060
If we accept this and meet
paradox head on, if we work

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:02.420
with and penetrate these
apparently unsolvable

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:05.935
conundrums, the place
we reach is insight.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:21.185
I was remembering when I was
a young Zen student--

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.304
just a brief part about
my own story--

00:13:28.304 --> 00:13:33.430
I took a one-year leave of
absence from Rutgers when I

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:37.160
was a psychology student there
and came out to the West

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.310
Coast, and then spent 10 years
living at the San Francisco

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:42.290
Zen Center.

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:45.270
So that one year turned
into 10 years.

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:49.440
And, as you might imagine and I
can see it now, now that I'm

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:54.050
a parent, that this wasn't
really what my parents had in

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:55.810
mind for me.

00:13:55.810 --> 00:14:02.770
And in particular my father was
quite upset with me for

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:08.280
having dropped out of college
and spent all these years

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:12.090
living at the San Francisco
Zen Center.

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:16.080
I think it was right in the
midst of that, maybe my fourth

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.910
or fifth year at the Zen Center
I got a call one day

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:23.100
from my mother, saying that my
father was quite ill, that my

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:27.250
father had cancer and
was in the hospital.

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:31.470
And I immediately, at this
time I was living at Zen

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:36.480
Center's Green Gulch farm in
Marin, a and I stopped doing

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:40.150
the work that I was doing, which
was working with horses,

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.250
learning how to farm
with horses.

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:48.400
And I got on a plane and flew to
New Jersey where I grew up.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:56.270
And I discovered that my father
was quite ill, that he

00:14:56.270 --> 00:15:01.410
had been highly, highly drugged,
and was so confused

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:06.180
at night that they had to tie
him down in order for him not

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:08.270
to be wandering around
the hospital.

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:12.020
And I discovered that no one had
let him know at all what

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:13.440
was happening, and that he was

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.780
completely, completely confused.

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:21.760
And fortunately I had some
really, really amazing

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.180
resources and support system
at the Zen Center, so that

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:31.260
when I arrived at the hospital,
my support system,

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:36.820
this group of older women
mentors, Zen teachers, they

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:40.070
told me that it just
looked like the

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:41.290
doctors were in charge.

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:45.650
That actually I was in charge
and that I could take control

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:47.280
of the situation.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:51.550
I could have them stop giving my
father drugs, I could untie

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:55.480
him, and I could actually have a
real conversation and let my

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:59.010
father know just what was
happening with him.

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:05.300
And I was so grateful and moved
that I had that kind of

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.270
support system and was
able to do that.

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:14.560
So I was 26 at the time.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:18.850
And I can remember after taking
my father off drugs,

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:23.720
untying him, and having a
conversation in which I let

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:28.530
him know that he was quite ill
and in fact he might be, it

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:31.110
looked, the doctors thought
that he didn't have

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:32.090
very long to live.

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:37.170
That he was dying of cancer, and
at the same time that one

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:40.350
never knows actually what will
happen, and I wanted to keep

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:42.600
some hope alive.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:51.820
And my father looked at me and
said that he had been so angry

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.240
with my choices.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:17:00.080
But he had no idea what I was
doing at the Zen Center, but

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:04.109
whatever it was I was doing,
he was really, really happy

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:05.560
and proud of me.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:10.540
And I was able to meet my father
in a way, in the most

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:14.730
intimate and powerful way that
I had in my entire life.

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:17.380
And this was a huge--

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:21.140
I had no idea that I had changed
or that I was any

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:27.500
different than I was, but it was
so amazing and powerful to

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:31.740
see, through my father's
eyes, the changes that

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:34.360
I had made in myself.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:38.690
And I feel like this is, in a
way, at the heart of knowing

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:41.240
yourself and forgetting
yourself.

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:46.120
Practicing over and over again
this self knowledge and self

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.950
forgetting.

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:53.040
I'm sitting here looking at my
good friend Meng who created,

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:57.860
was the inspiration for the
Search Inside Yourself program

00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:59.300
here at Google.

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:06.100
And I was just remembering Meng
and I taught together

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.990
many, many times, and I've
taught with other people as

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:12.650
well with the Search Inside
Yourself program.

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:15.770
And one day I was driving
down to Google.

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:18.810
We were about to teach
an all-day day

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:21.120
of mindfulness together.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.140
And I noticed as I was
driving I was feeling

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.860
more and more anxiety.

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:31.360
I was remembering that everyone
at Google who is in

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:36.010
the class was going to rate me
on a scale of one to five

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:38.660
about how my performance was.

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:43.790
And I noticed every time I got
these ratings my eye would go,

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:48.260
I would actually say who gave
me a bad, who gave me a one,

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.120
how many ones or
twos did I get.

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:54.400
And it didn't even seem to
matter if I got mostly fives.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:19:00.580
That I couldn't help but notice
how much effect it had

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:04.810
on me, those negative
assessments.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:08.890
And as I was driving down, I
noticed myself feeling more

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:14.360
and more upset and anxious and
not wanting to be there.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:19.180
And I happened to, I looked next
to me and I had some CDs.

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.190
I had a CD by the poet, this
wonderful poet, who I'm sure

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:24.030
many of you know-- if you
don't, you should--

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:25.670
David White.

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:31.260
I put in a CD by the poet
David White, and he was

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:35.000
talking about the importance
of embracing paradox.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.140
And the importance of finding
your own edge, and trusting

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:44.280
yourself no matter what might
be happening in your life.

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:49.410
And at some point I said
to myself, I'm just

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:50.310
going to show up.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:53.950
I'm just going to completely
show up for that class.

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:55.810
I don't care how
they grade me.

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:58.330
It doesn't matter.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:03.320
And I walked in to that room,
and Meng and I started

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.960
teaching that class together.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:09.140
And I think it was like at the
break in the morning, Meng

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:12.760
turned to me and said what
happened to you?

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:17.900
That there was a way that
I felt really freed.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:23.120
And I think part of my own
freedom was recognizing that I

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:27.250
felt my own feeling of
being an impostor.

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:31.840
And I think the more and more
we put ourselves out there,

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:35.110
the more successful we are, the
more we're able to do what

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:37.970
we actually want to do, I
think it's more and more

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:42.750
important that we recognize that
we all have some version

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:50.140
of that anxiety and doubt, and
maybe even feeling like a

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:51.900
complete impostor.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:58.170
And I think this is part of this
paradox of be confident,

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:00.310
question everything.

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:05.960
And I think the more we can
question, the more we can go

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.490
deeper and deeper to
find ourselves.

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:13.080
And the more that we can go
deeper and deeper, the more

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.650
confident we feel.

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:19.230
And at the same time, the more
and more confident we feel,

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:23.690
invariably, over and over again,
more and more questions

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:30.650
arise about what really
is our motivation.

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:39.390
That we're all so much of our
human lives and our human--

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:44.090
human life is about
relationship, and relationship

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:48.320
seems to be about conflict
and paradox.

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:53.850
That we even feel, so much so
that we even feel conflict

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:56.010
within ourselves.

00:21:56.010 --> 00:22:01.850
Do we accept what is, or
do we fight for change?

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:04.870
And the answer to that is yes.

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:12.030
Yes, we have to completely
practice accepting what is,

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:15.200
and at the same time,
we need to practice

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.260
fighting for change.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:20.890
And I like to call, and actually
this was an idea that

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:27.820
I got from reading some books
by Peter Senge, in which he

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:32.630
talks about creative tension
and the importance of being

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:38.500
able to stay with and embrace
creative tension.

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:41.910
And I think I didn't like so
much calling it tension, so I

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:44.700
call it in my book
creative gaps.

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:49.950
And a creative gap is
identifying and recognizing

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:53.700
where you are now and where
you want to be.

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:57.150
And this can be with a
particular project.

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:04.380
So like, all of you, I'm sure,
have maybe tens or 50 or

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:08.530
hundreds of creative
gaps in your life.

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:10.180
What are the projects?

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:14.000
What are the things that you're
working on in which, if

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.880
you look where are you now and
where do you want to be in

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.330
that project?

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:23.410
We also have big life
creative gaps.

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:26.470
Where are you in your life right
now, and where do you

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:27.560
want to be?

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:32.510
We have these emotional
creative gaps.

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:36.760
In what way, what are some
particular, maybe we want to

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:39.340
cultivate more joy.

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:42.450
Maybe we want to cultivate
more kindness.

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:47.530
Maybe we want to cultivate more
compassion in our lives.

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:52.120
So just starting with accepting
where you are now,

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:57.010
how much joy, how much kindness,
how much compassion

00:23:57.010 --> 00:24:00.360
is there in your
life right now?

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:03.510
And where do you want to be, and
what do you need to do to

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:05.450
actually get there?

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:13.270
So this is an example of
accepting what is and fighting

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:14.720
for change at the same time.

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.090
I think I want to
try something.

00:24:23.565 --> 00:24:31.090
I want to get you all talking a
little bit about describing

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:34.850
yourselves a bit as a paradox.

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:39.550
And I want to do this
in two ways.

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:45.750
One is I'm going to ask
you to think about how

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:47.860
you might be a paradox.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:52.680
And I also want to ask people to
take a little bit of a risk

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:58.280
here, and the image that
I have is that

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:02.000
we're all like icebergs.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:02.340
Right?

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:06.770
If each person is like an
iceberg, and we have the,

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:11.190
there's the water line, and
usually there's an awful lot

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:14.980
for us going on beneath
the surface.

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:18.020
Beneath the surface of the water
is where the real stuff

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:19.610
is happening in us.

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:23.650
So like, right now beneath the
water line for me is I'm

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:27.330
excited, and I'm nervous.

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:31.550
I see, one person just
got up to leave, and

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:32.560
I'm like oh my god.

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:33.360
He doesn't like what--

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.710
so there's that.

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:41.040
And just I'm kind of wondering
in myself, how's it going?

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.030
What do I want to do?

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:47.490
How is this all being
received?

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:52.650
And at the same time, I feel
the paradoxes in myself.

00:25:52.650 --> 00:26:02.580
I feel my own confidence, my own
questioning, my sense of

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:06.400
that there's all the time
in the world right now.

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.420
I feel spacious.

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:10.326
And I feel like, oh my god,
it's almost 1:30.

00:26:10.326 --> 00:26:12.090
There's three minutes left.

00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:14.830
So these are just some things
that are coming up

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:17.400
for me right now.

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.880
So what I want everyone to do,
if you're willing to go along,

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.160
I hope you'll be willing to go
along-- stay with me for a few

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:29.520
more minutes, to find a partner
and just have a brief

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:35.690
conversation with your partner
about these two topics.

00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:40.420
One, what's happening for you
right now below the surface,

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:42.570
beneath the water line.

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:46.050
What feelings, what thoughts,
what images are coming up for

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:48.130
you right now.

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:52.900
And the other is just say a few
words that might describe

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:54.390
you as a paradox.

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:59.770
In what way, talk about a few
things in your own life, and

00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:03.670
your own being, that come
up for you right now as

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:04.990
paradoxical.

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:05.860
OK?

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:08.620
So just turn to the person
next to you, if there's

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.010
someone next to you.

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:12.810
If there's not, feel
free to stand up.

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:16.040
And just for a few minutes have
this conversation with

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:17.059
your partner.

00:27:17.059 --> 00:27:27.538
[GROUP DISCUSSIONS]

00:27:27.538 --> 00:27:32.030
[BELL CHIME]

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:33.700
So if you can finish
up, thank your

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:34.950
partner, and come on back.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.930
I just want to read one thing,
and then I'm interested to

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:52.550
hear how that was and if
there's any questions.

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:58.120
It seems at times as though we
have no choice but to act as

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:01.950
though the world is permanent,
solid and predictable.

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:05.950
And at the same time we must
realize that everything around

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:10.660
us is impermanent, fluid,
and unpredictable.

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:14.310
If we go too far toward
believing in permanence, we'll

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:17.720
be thrown when something
unexpected happens.

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:21.370
If we lean too far toward a
belief in impermanence, we may

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:25.190
fall into the trap of not
setting clear goals, not

00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:28.760
achieving what is within our
potential, and living

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.550
irresponsibly.

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:33.000
This can be a way of trying
to protect ourselves from

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.310
failure, or sometimes of trying
to protect ourselves

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:38.580
from success.

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:41.370
The secret of successful
business practice and life

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:44.620
practice is finding the balance
between control and

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:46.140
letting go.

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:50.460
It's understanding that though
little is within our control,

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:54.230
we must act with complete
responsibility.

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:57.630
In one of his talks Shunryu
Suzuki, who was the founder of

00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:03.470
the San Francisco Zen Center,
said the secret is just to say

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:07.630
yes and jump off from here.

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:10.590
Then there is no problem.

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:14.360
It means to be yourself
in the present moment.

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.030
Always yourself.

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:21.380
Without sticking to an old self,
you forget yourself and

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:23.960
are refreshed.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:28.400
This short, pithy, four-line
story points to the dilemma

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:32.930
that we all have, that we all
face, all experience.

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:37.240
How do we balance all of these
seemingly impossible demands

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:39.100
and priorities?

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:44.770
How can I be happy, feel safe,
be satisfied, provide for

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:48.230
myself and family,
and help others?

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:50.500
What is this life?

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:54.170
What does it mean to be an
authentic human being in the

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:59.940
realm of family, work, smart
phones, relationships, love,

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:03.150
hate, birth, and death?

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:07.000
We're all perched on the
top of a 100-foot pole.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.740
This is a famous Zen story.

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:11.600
We're all perched on the
top of a 100-foot pole.

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.010
Together.

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:17.300
It is a very wide pole,
so wide there's no

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:19.150
place to fall off.

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:21.606
Just say yes.

00:30:21.606 --> 00:30:22.980
MALE SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:24.024
MARC LESSER: Excellent.

00:30:24.024 --> 00:30:25.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:27.530
Are there --

00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:28.470
well, first of all,
I'm interested.

00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:32.250
How was it having those
conversations about looking

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:35.010
beneath the surface and
yourself as a paradox?

00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:38.390
And are there any questions or
comments about anything?

00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:41.200
MALE SPEAKER 2: So in talking
about paradox and what's

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:46.330
arising right now, one of the
questions we talked about was

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:49.520
if, as they say, the heart of
true practice is beyond words,

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.575
then why do we all feel
compelled to come here today

00:30:51.575 --> 00:30:53.160
and listen to you
talk about it?

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:02.520
MARC LESSER: Well this is
actually very close to, I

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:05.970
started my talk by talking
about Dogen.

00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:08.780
And it was said that one of
the things that drove him,

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:12.750
over and over again, to practice
was the question if

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:18.710
we all inherently have Buddha
nature, if we all are perfect

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:23.240
just the way we are, why
do we need to practice?

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:26.070
And in some way I think your
question is the same question.

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:26.850
Right?

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:29.740
We all know that we don't
need words and letters.

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:34.580
We have a kind of amazing,
innate understanding already,

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:36.210
innate intuition about--

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:38.030
it's all there.

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:43.350
And we all need a
lot of practice.

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:47.060
Again it reminds me of this
famous Suzuki Roshi quote,

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:52.575
where this was something he
said, I think this was during

00:31:52.575 --> 00:31:56.260
a long sitting where he looked
out at his audience and said

00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:59.940
"you're all perfect just as
you are, and you can use a

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:07.590
little improvement." So I think
we come here together to

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:11.850
both sit and feel our own
perfection, and at the same

00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:17.520
time these words help us to fill
in these creative gaps.

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:20.220
So I think there's that sense
of perfection, and there's a

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:23.240
sense of these creative gaps.

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:25.690
Another place these creative
gaps show up a lot, which I

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:27.880
didn't say, is just in our
day-to-day habits.

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:33.020
Our own habitual reactions
to things.

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:36.610
So a creative gap that I feel,
and I think a lot of us feel,

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:42.150
is wanting to feel more and more
a sense of freedom, more

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:47.170
and more sense of less
self-consciousness.

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:52.280
So in a way this book, know
yourself, the forget yourself

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.830
part has a few different
elements to it.

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:58.340
It has a compassion
element to it.

00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:00.270
A listening to others
element to it.

00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:01.190
A helping others.

00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:04.360
But I think at its heart, the
other level of meaning it has,

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:10.120
is to be able to find a kind
of freedom where we can be

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:13.350
less and less self-conscious,
and more and more free and

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:16.460
trusting of ourselves
and of our life.

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:20.000
That's why we, that's why
we need all these words.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.390
Thank you.

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:24.584
Other questions or comments?

00:33:24.584 --> 00:33:25.880
NICK: I have a question.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.330
This is Nick on VC.

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:28.120
MARC LESSER: Yes.

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:29.020
NICK: Can you hear
me all right?

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:31.640
MARC LESSER: I can hear you.

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:32.270
NICK: Great talk.

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:33.790
Thank you.

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:37.610
My question is in terms
of creative gaps.

00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:41.420
For those of us who really
aren't sure where we want to

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:43.537
be, what are some good questions
that we could ask

00:33:43.537 --> 00:33:45.270
ourselves to better
define that?

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:51.970
MARC LESSER: Great question.

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:58.260
I think this is one of the
things that in the program

00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:02.130
here, Search Inside Yourself,
we do a lot of different

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:05.000
explorations around that.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.719
One is the third of the five
emotional intelligence pieces,

00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:12.650
is called motivation.

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:17.290
So you can do a lot of different
explorations around

00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:20.199
better understanding your
own motivation.

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:24.400
So we do an exercise
around envisioning.

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.530
We do something around
alignment.

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:29.420
So you can look at, you can
start with alignment--

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:31.170
is a great place to start.

00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:36.350
To be asking yourself, and
asking yourself and having

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:39.790
conversations with others around
things like what really

00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:41.239
is important to you?

00:34:41.239 --> 00:34:42.360
What are your values?

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:43.600
What matters?

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.110
And in what way is what you're
doing now and it's your life

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:51.650
now in alignment with those
values, with those things that

00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:52.190
are important.

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:55.639
Just digging down there.

00:34:55.639 --> 00:35:00.990
In a way, meditation practice is
about being so quiet and so

00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:05.170
still that your true motivation
starts to arise.

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:08.150
What's really important to
you starts to come up.

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:11.800
You start to pay attention to
your feelings, to your voice,

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.040
to your body.

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:15.970
So it's mostly about
all kinds of ways

00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:17.420
of paying more attention.

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:21.310
Through alignment, through
meditation practice, through

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:24.030
journaling and asking
yourself about--

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:28.240
we do an envisioning exercise
in which we envision if

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:33.560
everything in your life went
exactly as you want it to go,

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.860
what would your life
look like now?

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:36.770
In three years?

00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:37.730
Or in five years?

00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:40.940
This is another exercise.

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:43.390
So those are just some
ideas to that.

00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:48.690
But read Meng's book, "Search
Inside Yourself," and it has

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:49.820
many answers to that.

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:52.900
And my book also has many
questions and answers around

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:53.910
that topic.

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:55.610
Thank you.

00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:57.575
Other questions or comments?

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:01.530
I'm curious too.

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:06.610
What was it like to describe
yourself as a paradox, or to

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:08.830
dip down beneath the surface?

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:12.500
Did anyone feel some real
connection and intimacy with

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:15.090
this other person that was
a little surprising?

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:20.255
Right here in the middle
of a Google-y Monday?

00:36:20.255 --> 00:36:22.610
[INAUDIBLE]

00:36:22.610 --> 00:36:27.990
So you, so your comment was
you were surprised at the

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:32.850
commonality of the way your
partner described herself or

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:34.270
himself as a paradox.

00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:38.110
And you always thought
it was just you.

00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:40.405
I've noticed that whole--

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:45.870
it's one of the really wonderful
things about having

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:47.960
real conversations
with people.

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:50.210
So that would be--

00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:52.300
One of things that I talk
about in the book is

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:55.630
recommending a personal audit.

00:36:55.630 --> 00:37:03.580
Actually, so it's one thing to
say start where you are or

00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:04.670
accepting what is.

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:07.370
But it's interesting actually
to start with

00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:09.580
what actually is.

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:13.000
And one of the-- there's what
I think of as the things we

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.340
all know and maybe some of us
do or don't do, which is

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:17.940
things like getting
enough sleep,

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:21.080
exercise, eating good food.

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:24.210
But I think the kind of food
that I think may be one of the

00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:28.817
most important foods is our
relationships, and the level

00:37:28.817 --> 00:37:32.740
of openness and intimacy
in our relationships.

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:35.010
So one of the things you might
do in a personal audit is

00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:38.440
start to keep track of how many
real conversations do you

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:41.620
have with someone
during the day.

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:43.140
Just notice.

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:46.250
And you can define a real
conversation maybe as where

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:51.300
you or someone else actually
expressed some emotion, and

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:52.680
there might have been
some emotional

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:55.110
connection with people.

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:58.880
And just start to, just maybe
for a week, start to jot down

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:02.370
at the end of each day how many
real conversations, how

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:06.600
many intimate conversations
did I have during the day.

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:09.300
For some people, I think--

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:13.230
it's interesting this is
partly a gender thing.

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:18.120
I think women tend to talk a lot
more about their feelings

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:22.430
and emotions, and men tend to
talk a lot less about feelings

00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:23.050
and emotions.

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:27.710
That's just a generalization
which isn't 100 percent true.

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:30.560
But wherever you are, man or
woman, just notice where are

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:37.640
you on that scale, and how
might it be beneficial to

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:41.660
shift that needle in terms of
having the right amount of

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:45.986
intimate, real conversations
during your day.

00:38:45.986 --> 00:38:48.481
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: In an
environment like this in here,

00:38:48.481 --> 00:38:51.974
where a lot of people are,
let's call it black and

00:38:51.974 --> 00:38:53.371
white-- this is the right thing
to do; this is the wrong

00:38:53.371 --> 00:38:54.469
thing to do.

00:38:54.469 --> 00:38:55.966
This is the right thing,
I have to do

00:38:55.966 --> 00:38:57.463
to climb the ladder.

00:38:57.463 --> 00:38:58.960
What do you recommend?

00:38:58.960 --> 00:38:59.958
How can we--

00:38:59.958 --> 00:39:02.952
what are the pieces we can
contribute for people to

00:39:02.952 --> 00:39:07.530
embrace the gray area and the
growth and the tension in our

00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:09.860
day-to-day [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:10.250
MARC LESSER: Yeah.

00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:13.950
Well I think, especially in this
kind of environment and

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:17.860
in a lot of business
environments, we want things

00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:18.850
to be clear.

00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:19.040
Right?

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:20.230
We want clarity.

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:21.760
We want that sense of ladder.

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:27.060
And I think we should spend as
much time as it takes to get

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:28.350
that clear.

00:39:28.350 --> 00:39:33.140
But I think to be successful,
to really be successful and

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:37.250
happy, both in this environment
or pretty much any

00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:41.345
environment, it's about
resilience and how we adapt.

00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:47.230
The business model here
for, there's so much

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:48.700
change right here.

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:53.508
It's announced Google
Reader, gone.

00:39:53.508 --> 00:39:55.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:58.670
This might be a sore point.

00:39:58.670 --> 00:40:01.580
I miss Google Reader,
but I get it, right?

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:08.030
Because in my own company, you
have to make decisions.

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:12.600
And not everyone's going to be--
it's hard being a leader.

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:14.420
It's hard being a manager.

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:19.100
You see as clearly as you can,
and then you know that there's

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:20.890
a lot of things you
don't know.

00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:24.030
Who knew what would happen when
you make an announcement

00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:24.900
about Google Reader.

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:26.310
Who knew?

00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:29.660
Or who knew when Netflix
announced that they were

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:32.390
changing their whole
pricing scheme?

00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:37.460
And I think we're constantly,
whether it's out there

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:41.930
experimenting with products and
services, and within our

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:46.420
team, we're constantly, I think,
trying to get more

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:52.380
understanding of who are these
other people on the team?

00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:55.080
One of the things we teach in
Search Inside Yourself is a

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:56.990
political awareness.

00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:59.540
How does power work?

00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:01.960
How does power and decision
making work in this

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:03.140
organization?

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:05.900
And it's often pretty complex
and not so clear, so to be

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:11.070
able to have a sense of clarity
and at the same time

00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:13.960
to be adaptive and resilient.

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:18.280
And that also means being
willing to look stupid.

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:20.080
Being willing to fail.

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:20.230
All right.

00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:22.520
So I think, again this is
one of those paradoxes.

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:25.440
The more we hold
on, the more--

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:28.960
So it's a little bit like, as I
was describing my drive down

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:30.740
here, I think it was my--

00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:33.470
if I look underneath, it was
I wanted to be successful.

00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:35.390
I wanted to be the
best presenter.

00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:37.560
I wanted to get all fives.

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:42.010
I don't want anyone seeing
that I'm not perfect.

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:45.690
I think we all have
those feelings.

00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:49.300
And I think those get in the
way of our resilience and

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:55.000
adaptiveness, and being able
to course in a much fuller,

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.130
adaptive, resilient,
free world.

00:41:58.130 --> 00:42:01.550
So thank you for asking that.

00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:02.730
Thank you all very much.

00:42:02.730 --> 00:42:04.570
Really appreciate it.

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:09.470
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:11.740
CHADE-MENG TAN: So as you can
see, Marc Lesser is a

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:15.950
combination of profound Zen
wisdom and getting things done

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:17.660
in the business world.

00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:20.320
And for that we are
now business--

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:21.530
in a way we're partners now.

00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:22.890
We are partners in crime.

00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:26.920
Because Search Inside Yourself
has been taken out, with the

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:27.980
blessing of Google.

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:30.060
We founded an institute called
Search Inside Yourself

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:33.730
Leadership Institute,
S-I-Y-L-I, SIYLI.

00:42:33.730 --> 00:42:36.010
And Marc is the CEO of SIYLI--

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:36.790
the SIYLI boss.

00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:39.610
MARC LESSER: I get a big kick
of saying I'm the CEO of

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:44.150
silly, and my business partner
is Google's jolly good fellow.

00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:45.730
What could be better
than that?

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:47.200
CHADE-MENG TAN: What could
possibly go wrong?

00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:52.390
"Know Yourself, Forget
Yourself," available where

00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:55.090
books are sold, and my dear
friend Marc Lesser.

00:42:55.090 --> 00:43:01.315
[APPLAUSE]
