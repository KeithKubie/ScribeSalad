Four Temperaments and Their Effects on the Workplace 
More often than not, when people see successful

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.619
individuals, they often wonder, 
"What type of personality do these people have?"

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.310
"Were they simply born to be successful?" 
"Is it possible that these people just made the best of what they already had?"

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:35.899
One Greek man, named Hippocrates, believed that people can be divided into four distinct, yet overlapping categories,

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.770
based on their humors, which are fluids presumed to be inside the body and whose imbalance can lead to illness.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.600
These are also responsible for the different types of temperaments and personality.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.920
This theory still remains popular today, and it's used for employee management.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.630
Knowing these four temperaments and understanding how they work can assist with interactions between yourself, co-workers, and supervisors.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.960
Furthermore, identifying the strengths and weaknesses of each temperament assists in determining how people are capable of performing in a group.

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:14.500
Down below are the four most common temperaments and their advantages and disadvantages:

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.500
The main advantage of being a Sanguine is the ability to have flexibility and adaptability,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.789
while maintaining composure. 
They have great communication and entertainment skills.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.139
Some call them 'The Life of the Party,' due to their enthusiasm and popularity.

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:36.300
Sanguine is a very sociable and optimistic person; that makes them very easy to like.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.500
On the other hand,

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.100
a Sanguine often lacks the ability to empathize and understand, deeply.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.819
They are disorganized and may appear not to be serious about their work.

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.468
They have tendencies towards being naive and trusting others to do the work

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:56.719
they might not get around to. They mostly enjoy having fun and being showered with approval.

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.079
They tend to dislike people who don't respond to humor.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.100
Possessing the innate ability of leadership, a Choleric is obedient and goal-oriented.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.300
They have the ability to make quick decisions

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.740
and correct judgments which are often impulsive.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.300
These make them better suited to a field where change is common.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.270
A Choleric is quick to take charge of this situation,

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.249
and they are usually fast paced and require a degree of control in their work.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.236
They have a good sense of self-confidence and a sincere belief in personal achievement,

00:02:32.236 --> 00:02:35.800
which often leads to them accomplishing more in a short amount of time.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.409
However, due to their nature, a Choleric will come across as too domineering,

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:49.270
autocratic, and impatient: they often have difficulties delegating tasks to subordinates and, at the same time,

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.390
expecting them to produce the same quality as he does.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.680
They enjoy the presence and company  of people who are supportive and cooperative.
They dislike laziness and disloyalty.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.769
The calm and harmonious, a Phlegmatic values understanding and peace.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.300
They are composed and collected and have an even-tempered disposition,

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.600
with a drizzle of dry humor.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:21.000
They are meticulous in their decision-making, which can often be a disadvantage in a fast-paced environment.

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.500
A Phlegmatic is often the peacekeeper of the group,

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.700
solving problems and conflict, objectively, while maintaining an easygoing and relaxed posture.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.800
On the other hand, a Phlegmatic often lack enthusiasm, energy, and decisiveness.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.400
They dislike making major changes.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.200
Oftentimes, they don't set solid goals, react slowly, and avoid facing problems head-on.

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:49.600
A Phlegmatic likes people who recognize their own strengths and initiate action and decisions.

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.700
They do not like people who are too arrogant or pushy.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:04.000
While Melancholics are known as pessimistic and prefer solitude, they possess compassion for those in need.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.300
They are meticulous, organized, and analytical.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.100
They pay attention to every detail, and think of every possible outcome.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.000
This makes them good at setting and organizing long-term goals.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.100
They have high standards and ideals that they deem perfect.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:25.000
A Melancholic understands feelings while demanding quality performance.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.500
Often times, a melancholic takes life too seriously:

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:35.200
they tend to focus too much on details and preparation. 
They insist on achieving perfection.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:42.100
However, they do enjoy the company of intellectual people who can carry deep and sensible conversations.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.800
They dislike forgetfulness, tardiness, superficiality, and unpredictability.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Due to the varying degrees of positive and negative traits in a single temperament,

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.000
a combination of temperaments is not uncommon.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.400
Fast-paced leaders are often categorized as Sanguine-Choleric,

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.100
while decision-makers and advisers are Melancholic-Phlegmatic.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.900
It's balance that makes for a happy and healthy workplace.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.600
If you're hiring people, make sure you get a balance of temperaments to insure harmony in the office.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.700
Hope you've all enjoyed!
