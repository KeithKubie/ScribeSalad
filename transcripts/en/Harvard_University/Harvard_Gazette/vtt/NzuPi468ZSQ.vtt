00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:20.590
We are at Harvard University's Farmers' 
Market which takes place every Tuesday at the corner of Kirkland and Oxford street from 12pm to 6pm.

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:23.949
My name is Caroline Manning, 
I'm with the Harvard Farmers Market we're from 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.080
C&amp;C Lobsters from down in Hull.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.189
We are from Central Massachusetts and we're just 
a little family owned operation

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.440
but here we are letting everybody into the joys of 
maple.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:40.440
We raise grass fed hormone free livestock
cows, sheep, pigs, turkeys, chickens, 
quail, pheasant, goose, duck.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.920
My stuff was all picked yesterday,

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.120
it's all

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.560
twelve or fifteen hours

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.070
out the field.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:54.070
A lot of it I washed this morning and so
I think you can tell the difference looking at things
and tasting things

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.500
just that its fresh.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.119
The guys that grow 

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:01.239
our plants they start all the plants from
seed and they take care of them like they're their

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:02.650
children,

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.519
and this is what you get two years down the road.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.470
Im cooking one day and I'm like what'll happen if I throw this this and this in the pot,

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.850
and so I came out with the Sweet and Sassy's its got the biggest 
bite I prefer it in almonds but I prefer it in almonds but
I do it in cashews and pecans.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.670
Something I just discovered this past weekend

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.540
was to cut one inch

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.860
slabs, and then drizzle it 
with olive oil

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.090
and salt and throw it on the grill
and it gets black and crisp

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.829
on the outside and tender and sweet on the inside,
and the charred flavor does something about it 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.680
its delicious. You're buying them direct from
the fisherman,

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.310
which is helping the local fishermen,
and your getting a fresher product

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.520
because our lobsters are coming direct
out of their natural environment versus

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.000
refrigerated water and

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.070
tanks from the grocery store. It cuts out a middle man,

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.689
and its a really

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:47.870
inexpensive way to get

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.619
a business going ya know, you

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.680
just need a popup tent.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.020
There's a diverse crowd here from
many countries,

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.320
so it's a great

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.240
opportunity to chat with people

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.140
about this natural product that comes right out of trees.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.530
It's great because it has a ton of local farmers and vendors

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.520
from the area,

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.240
so there's a bunch of great stuff to choose from.
