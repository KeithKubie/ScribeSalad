00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.070
across this ship this er looks like this
alien craft and they're just looking

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080
alien craft and they're just looking

around the ship seeing what's on there
and that's the basic summary uh again

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400
and that's the basic summary uh again
 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.800
and that's the basic summary uh again
without giving away too much so

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810
without giving away too much so
 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.820
without giving away too much so

that's a disappointment uh should talk a

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:30.750
that's a disappointment uh should talk a
 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.870
that's a disappointment uh should talk a
little bit about Charlize Theron

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880
little bit about Charlize Theron
 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.770
little bit about Charlize Theron
this I think not only is she kind of

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780
this I think not only is she kind of
 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.480
this I think not only is she kind of
missed cash she's supposed to be really

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490
missed cash she's supposed to be really
 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.090
missed cash she's supposed to be really
tough and really the you know we're

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:41.100
tough and really the you know we're
 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.860
tough and really the you know we're
gonna do things my way and I

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:42.870
gonna do things my way and I
 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.140
gonna do things my way and I
you need like a Linda Hamilton or an

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.150
you need like a Linda Hamilton or an
 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.670
you need like a Linda Hamilton or an
Emma Thompson or is that someone I can

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680
Emma Thompson or is that someone I can
 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.910
Emma Thompson or is that someone I can
really command authority and she's not

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:49.920
really command authority and she's not
 

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.500
really command authority and she's not
horrible I don't think she has that um

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:53.510
horrible I don't think she has that um
 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.090
horrible I don't think she has that um
there's a little bit of a twist in there

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:56.100
there's a little bit of a twist in there
 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.360
there's a little bit of a twist in there
with the guy who started this whole

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:58.370
with the guy who started this whole
 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.800
with the guy who started this whole
operation and stuff it's not a very good

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:00.810
operation and stuff it's not a very good
 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.960
operation and stuff it's not a very good
strong twist um

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:02.970
strong twist um
 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.990
strong twist um
and everything that pretty much it's

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000
and everything that pretty much it's
 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.470
and everything that pretty much it's
been building up to just comes down to

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:09.480
been building up to just comes down to
 

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:15.890
been building up to just comes down to
the most basic it's such a basic it's so

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:15.900
the most basic it's such a basic it's so
 

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:19.970
the most basic it's such a basic it's so
disgustingly simple um but in the end

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:19.980
disgustingly simple um but in the end
 

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.620
disgustingly simple um but in the end
it's like why is it so disgustingly

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:21.630
it's like why is it so disgustingly
 

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:24.710
it's like why is it so disgustingly
simple let's venture forth and find out

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720
simple let's venture forth and find out
 

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.840
simple let's venture forth and find out
in Prometheus 2 and Oh for me it was

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:29.850
in Prometheus 2 and Oh for me it was
 

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:31.370
in Prometheus 2 and Oh for me it was
very frustrating and I was someone who

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:31.380
very frustrating and I was someone who
 

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.590
very frustrating and I was someone who
was not hyped so my guess would be that

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:33.600
was not hyped so my guess would be that
 

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.050
was not hyped so my guess would be that
if you are very hyped to see this movie

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:36.060
if you are very hyped to see this movie
 

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.450
if you are very hyped to see this movie
and hype to get some answers well that's

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:38.460
and hype to get some answers well that's
 

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.580
and hype to get some answers well that's
the key words some answers you'll get a

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:40.590
the key words some answers you'll get a
 

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:44.060
the key words some answers you'll get a
few answers everything else is build-up

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:44.070
few answers everything else is build-up
 

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:46.940
few answers everything else is build-up
for another one it's not like you can

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:46.950
for another one it's not like you can
 

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:49.790
for another one it's not like you can
just go from this into alien that's not

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:49.800
