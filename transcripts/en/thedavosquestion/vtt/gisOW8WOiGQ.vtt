&gt;&gt;Rakesh Khurana: Hi, You Tube. The question
is should management have an oath like doctors?

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.360
I think absolutely. First of all, business
is too important an institution to be run

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.870
only by self-interest. Moreover, if we hope
to restore trust at some level we have to

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.890
trust that our business leaders are not just
guided by self interest and basically self

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.160
enrichment, but rather see their organizations
and institutions as a way of developing and

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.630
creating value for society not simply extracting
society. I think a good place for business

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.790
to start would be the first maxim of the Hippocratic
Oath. First, do no harm.
