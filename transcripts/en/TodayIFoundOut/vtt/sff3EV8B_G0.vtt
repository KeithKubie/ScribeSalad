00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.590
It was approximately four thousand years ago
in Finland when people first strapped on skates

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.190
to glide across the ice.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.240
This wasn’t for entertainment purposes,
though.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.780
Finland is full of lakes and cutting across
the ice saved time on daily journeys.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.180
By 1 AD, ice skating existed across Northern
Europe.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.960
Metal skates were first created by the Dutch
in 1250 and this led to the proliferation

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.380
of leisure skating.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.830
Rinks were built across Europe, but the first
commercial rink in North America was probably

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.300
built in Montreal during the mid-19th century.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.630
The first one in the US was Madison Square
Garden ice rink, constructed in 1879.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.800
Of course, keeping the ice frozen, smooth
and safe has always been something of a struggle.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.300
To get around this issue, brothers Joe and
Lester Patrick designed a mechanism for indoor

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.790
rinks that utilized brine water to refrigerate
a concrete base, as thin coats of water was

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.730
slowly poured over to create layers of ice.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.860
To resurface the ice when it melted and chipped,
the remaining bits of the old ice had to be

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.470
removed or smoothed and then this process
was essentially repeated.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:09.380
But it took a long time and required a large
crew to complete the several-times-a-day task.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.850
Quite simply, there had to be a better way.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.180
It was the turn of the 20th century when Frank
Zamboni was born to recent immigrant parents

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.229
in a small town south of Salt Lake City, Utah.

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.630
When Zamboni was a baby, his family bought
a farm not too far way in Idaho.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.510
That’s where he got his first experiences
in mechanical engineering.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.930
Frank Zamboni, his brothers and father spent
long hours tinkering and fixing broken farm

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:33.930
equipment.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.850
Frank also worked a local garage, repairing
old pickup trucks.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.270
“While my father never got past the ninth
grade in formal schooling, he always had an

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.430
inquisitive mind in solving problems,” Frank’s
son Richard Zamboni later told Popular Mechanics,

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.990
“Whether it was electrical, mechanical,
or business-related, he had the unique ability

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.250
to get to the heart of issues.”

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.610
When Frank was 19, the family moved to Clearwater,
California – a town 15 miles south of Los

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.600
Angeles and in the harbor district – because
Frank’s older brother owned a successful

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.600
garage there.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.299
Frank helped at the garage and took a second
job as a blacksmith’s apprentice.

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.560
Within a year, the family had saved enough
money to send Frank to Chicago’s Coyne Trade

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.370
School to study electrical engineering.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.260
When he returned in 1922, Frank and his brothers
opened an electrical company that they would

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.069
eventually name “Zamboni Bros. Co.”

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.670
They specialized in installing refrigeration
units for the local Dutch-owned dairies that

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.209
dominated the small town of Clearwater and
its neighbor Paramount.

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.670
Locally, Frank Zamboni became known as a mechanical
and electrical wizard.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.560
In 1928, he registered for his first patent,
a thing called “Adjustable Reactor Resistance“.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.700
In fact, over his lifetime Frank Zamboni would
be awarded 15 patents, including one for the

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.390
Astro Zamboni Machine, which was designed
to suck up water from AstroTurf at a rate

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.660
of about 400 gallons per minute.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.040
In the late 1920s, the brothers used their
refrigeration know-how to open an ice-making

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.069
plant that kept local fruits and vegetables
fresh and cold as they were being shipped

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.420
across the country via train.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.930
However, already by then, freon was being
successfully used in commercial refrigeration.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.739
By the 1930s, refrigerators became something
anyone could have in their home.

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:17.640
Within only a few years of the Zamboni Brothers
starting their ice-making plant, it was obsolete.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:24.150
So, in January 1940 and using their ice-making
skills, they opened a 20,000 square foot ice

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.330
skating rink across the street from their
former business.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.700
It was called Iceland and it was one of the
largest ice rinks in the country.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.410
So, why would the Zamboni brothers build a
humongous ice skating rink in a Southern California

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.000
town that was miles away from Los Angeles?

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.019
Because of the local Dutch population, for
whom skating had become a part of everyday

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.750
life starting in the 13th century (in particular,
speed skating).

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.489
The rink was an immediate hit, attracting
150,000 people a year.

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.739
But they had problems – mostly due to the
omnipresent Southern California sun.

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.959
Although the brothers quickly added a roof
and Frank had installed a new and improved

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.580
version of what the Patrick brothers did in
Canada, the ice did not stay frozen for long

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.640
and often melted.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.750
Thus, it required constant attention from
a large crew that needed more than an hour

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.690
to manually resurface the ice.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.530
The process was inefficient and time-consuming.

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.469
So, Frank Zamboni – the most skilled engineer
of a family full of them – got to work.

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:29.139
It took more than seven years, parts pulled
from all over and several failed models, but

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:33.680
by 1949, Zamboni had a working prototype for
an “ice resurfacer.”

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.110
He started with two Dodge truck front ends,
which he used for both the front and back.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.550
He put in a transmission, a front steering
axle that provided four wheel drive and a

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.559
Jeep engine – all from war surplus junkyards.

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:50.860
Zamboni then tacked on a tractor seat, a chalice
from an oil derrick and the landing gear of

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.590
a Douglas A-26 bomber.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:58.599
Finally, he added elements to the souped-up
ice-traveling tractor that shaved and resurfaced

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:03.580
the ice – razor blades, a paddle and chain
system, a wood box to catch the savings, another

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.439
tank with hot water and a towel to spread
the water on the ice.

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:14.279
In the summer of 1949, with the ever present
California sun glowing hot, he debuted his

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:17.149
“Model A Zamboni Ice Resurfacer.”

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:21.050
It was top-heavy, bizarrely complicated to
control, and loud.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:27.399
But it worked, requiring only one operator
and about ten minutes to create a smooth new

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:29.029
sheet of ice.

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:35.539
(This first unit was used at Iceland for several
years and is now on display at the still-existing

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:36.539
ice rink as a piece of American history.)

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:40.639
Soon after, Zamboni patented his ice resurfacer,
formed a partnership with his brothers that

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:46.169
he called “Frank J. Zamboni &amp; Co” and
went to work on Model B. Tinkering and improving

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:51.720
the machine, he made his first sale – to
nearby Pasadena Winter Gardens- for $5,000.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.889
The next one (and third one) he built for
Norwegian Olympian (and movie star) Sonja

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:59.830
Henie, who had seen the Zamboni in action
while she practiced for her “Hollywood on

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:00.990
Ice” show at Iceland.

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.710
(On that note, it’s unclear when the name
of the machine shifted from “ice resurfacer”

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.369
to the name of the inventor, but legend has
it that Henie was the one who asked Frank

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:12.439
to give her one of those “Zambonis.”)

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:16.490
Whatever the case, the fourth Zamboni was
sold to the Ice Capades.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.050
That one is now on display at the Hockey Hall
of Fame.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:24.610
The Zamboni made its NHL debut in 1952 during
a Boston Bruins game, forever cementing the

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.550
relationship between the machine and the sport.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:32.889
Over six decades later, the Zamboni is a cultural
icon, inspiring fandom beyond anyone’s wildest

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:33.889
imagination.

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:36.860
After all, it was merely built to make a cold,
wet job easier.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.650
“I don’t understand it,” the baffled
inventor told the Los Angeles Times in 1988,

00:06:41.650 --> 00:07:08.419
“I was just trying to find a better way
of doing something.”
