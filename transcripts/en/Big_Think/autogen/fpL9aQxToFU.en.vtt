I think that science and faith you know

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040
I think that science and faith you know
 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.879
I think that science and faith you know
do have somewhat of an adversarial

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889
do have somewhat of an adversarial
 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.000
do have somewhat of an adversarial
relationship in that faith is based as

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010
relationship in that faith is based as
 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.250
relationship in that faith is based as
the name suggests on faith you're not

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260
the name suggests on faith you're not
 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.200
the name suggests on faith you're not
testing anything you are given the

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210
testing anything you are given the
 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.689
testing anything you are given the
answers in a book or by your elders and

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699
answers in a book or by your elders and
 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.759
answers in a book or by your elders and
it's about accepting those answers

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769
it's about accepting those answers
 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.250
it's about accepting those answers
whereas science is about always asking

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260
whereas science is about always asking
 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.259
whereas science is about always asking
questions it's about testing things

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269
questions it's about testing things
 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.810
questions it's about testing things
about assembling evidence and saying you

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820
about assembling evidence and saying you
 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.670
about assembling evidence and saying you
know do we come down on this side of the

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680
know do we come down on this side of the
 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.410
know do we come down on this side of the
argument of the other side and so I

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420
argument of the other side and so I
 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.880
argument of the other side and so I
think there's always going to be some

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890
think there's always going to be some
 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.569
think there's always going to be some
tension there now that said I think it's

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579
tension there now that said I think it's
 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.459
tension there now that said I think it's
possible for people to have religious

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469
possible for people to have religious
 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.200
possible for people to have religious
beliefs and still believe in evolution

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210
beliefs and still believe in evolution
 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.660
beliefs and still believe in evolution
and you know the genetic details that

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670
and you know the genetic details that
 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.490
and you know the genetic details that
we're discussing in the lectures that I

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500
we're discussing in the lectures that I
 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.139
we're discussing in the lectures that I
gave and the books and films and

of people living in that at one
 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.450
of people living in that at one
particular location and so you know it's

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460
particular location and so you know it's
 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.740
particular location and so you know it's
not that different from the story in

not that different from the story in
 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.319
not that different from the story in
Genesis now the judeo-christian story is

Genesis now the judeo-christian story is
 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.450
Genesis now the judeo-christian story is
not the only one and there are lots of

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460
not the only one and there are lots of
 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.910
not the only one and there are lots of
creation stories every group around the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920
creation stories every group around the
 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.380
creation stories every group around the
world has some kind of a story that

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390
world has some kind of a story that

of answering that question faith is

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009
of answering that question faith is

another way of answering it and
 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.630
another way of answering it and
traditional stories and so you know we

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640
traditional stories and so you know we
 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.630
traditional stories and so you know we
do sometimes come into conflict to

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640
do sometimes come into conflict to
 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.910
do sometimes come into conflict to
certain degree with traditional stories

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920
certain degree with traditional stories
 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.950

that people have been living in the same
 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.339
that people have been living in the same
location forever you know that they were

of Australia you've been here for 50
 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.870
of Australia you've been here for 50
thousand years longer than Europeans

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880
thousand years longer than Europeans

have been living in Europe but in

addition you have a deeper connection
 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.780
addition you have a deeper connection
just as everybody else does around the

world to our ancestors all the way back
in Africa and so we'd like to see the

in Africa and so we'd like to see the
 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.690
in Africa and so we'd like to see the
stories that we're telling using science

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700
stories that we're telling using science
 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.840

as complementary to the stories that

as complementary to the stories that
 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.150
as complementary to the stories that
people are taught by their elders not as

a replacement that is a complement to
 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.600
a replacement that is a complement to
