Hey it's me Destin welcome back to Smarter Every Day. So I am in the middle of the California

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.000
desert and the sun is setting, and it's beautiful, so I'll just let you

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.010
see that while I set this video up for you. So a guy named

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.040
Jeff, he's taofledermaus on YouTube, which is German for bat, which is

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.070
flying mammal. Anyway, he asked me if I would participate in an international

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.080
high speed video collaboration in an effort to promote a lot of smaller

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.110
channels that study things with high speed video cameras, which I love

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.110
so, of course I'm gonna do that. So what the common theme was was

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.130
destroying snack foods, because we could all get our hands on snack foods and we all like to

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.140
destroy things so it was an easy one. My thought going in was, oh great

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.140
I can just have fun with high speed video and I don't have to worry about trying to educate or learn something,

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.170
but I was wrong because I learned something. So here's what I'm gonna do.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.180
I'm gonna show you the video that me and Trevor my neighbour made, just goofing off

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.210
trying to destroy snack foods and then all of a sudden, bam, I learned something.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.220
So I hope you learn it with me. Ahh, well I'll just let you watch. Check this out. 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.230
(Destin) If you grew up in the south, you know what a Zebco 33 is.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.260
Alright, so doughnut.. High speed camera..

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.280
Ooh! Sprinkles!

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.310
And, a bow.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.340
(Trevor) I'll get it sitting perfectly.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.370
(Destin) By the way we also have another camera here,

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.400
on the bow. 
(Trevor) Ready to rock.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.500
Arrgh.. We've decided we're gonna shoot the side of a sprinkle doughnut

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.520
if Trevor would quit eating the doughnuts.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.260
Mountain Dew.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.570
(Trevor) Here's Dew in your eye.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.660
(Destin) It did a helicopter thing.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.730
So what do you think we should call this video?
(Trevor) Well this one's gonna be mountain spew.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.820
[gunshot]

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.850
[slowed down gunshot]

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.910
Don't worry. I don't waste food.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.520
Little bit of lead in it though. 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.940
OK so now's the part where I learn something.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.960
Right before I fired this P22 pistol at this doughnut, this

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.970
fly started buzzing around the doughnut, and I decided you know it'd be cool if I waited

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.980
until he was at the correct depth of field and I would fire and let the blast wave

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.020
propogate over his wings and see how he handles it in his flight, and he handled it

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.050
quite well. So what he did is the blast wave came over his wings and

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.080
it tucked and rolled him just a little bit but instead of trying to compensate he just

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.110
stops, and he waits, and when he waits he's letting

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.140
his centre of gravity overcome the flow of air over his centre of pressure

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.160
and then he paddles to the side just a little bit and once he does that

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.170
he regains control authority and then he just takes back off.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.180
And all this happens in an instant. It was marvellous, it was pretty amazing.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.220
So anyway, watch the footage, and after you see the footage, I will put the link

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.220
to the playlist for the high speed collaboration video so you can see

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.230
things that are pretty cool like, I don't know, how to shoot a slingshot with one hand.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.250
Anyway, enjoy this video. I learned something.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.290
[gunshot]

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.300
[slowed down gunshot]

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.350
[slowed down gunshot]

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.390
