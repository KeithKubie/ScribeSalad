00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:04.410
As the poet Shawn Carter said, "I got no patience,
and I hate waitin.."

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:15.650
You aren't alone Jay, luckily, science has
the answer.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.210
The holidays are upon us, which means waiting.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.880
Lots of waiting.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.460
Waiting in lines is agonizing.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.040
You get in line, and then the other one moves
faster and you switch…

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.960
Then after like 2 minutes you're freaking
out and the first line is…

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.960
GAAHHH

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.470
Waiting in line is the worst.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.570
Humans HATE waiting in line.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:41.290
Surveys done consistently find that humans
will estimate they waited 36-percent longer

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.810
than they really did.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:43.810
Why?

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.230
Humans are self-obsessed, // and why SHOULDN'T
I BE?

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.600
I'm awesome.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.160
// But of course, all this self-obsession
doesn't translate well to efficiency at the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.160
cash register.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.520
A paper called "The Psychology of Waiting
[in] Lines" says we hate standing in queues

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.320
because we see it as time wasted which could
otherwise be productive.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.350
To solve this, businesses toss psychological
tricks into the queuing area -- think mirrors

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:15.149
by elevators, long walks from arrival gates
to baggage claims, televisions at theme parks,

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.689
candy, gum, magazines, or batteries at grocery
stores...

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:25.590
These things make you FEEL like the time waiting
on line is being used; and you no longer overestimate

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.590
the wait!

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.540
The science behind all this, is a relationship
between "queuing theory," "illusory correlation,"

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.960
and the "just world fallacy."

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.889
The "just world fallacy" says, psychologically,
humans tend to believe the world is a fair,

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:41.549
orderly, predictable place where people get
what they deserve.

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.289
So when you jump in a line and the one NEXT
to you starts moving faster, you freak, because

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.989
we don't want to believe we deserve this!

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:50.759
// WHY ME, GOD!!

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:51.759
WHY!?!

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.229
// So, because of the illusory correlation,
we act without thinking and switch lines.

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.570
This second theory is where humans create
a correlation in their minds when it doesn't

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.349
exist -- think stereotypes, or patterns which
we BELIEVE exist, but they don't.

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:07.560
Why does the first line instantly seem to
speed up now?

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.560
// STUPID!

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.800
WHY DID I LEAVE THAT ONE?!

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.880
// It doesn't ACTUALLY speed up, it just looks
like it does.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.720
We don't want to do the mental math concerning
the number of parcels, payment methods, cashier

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.230
speeds, price tag placement and so on.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.890
Instead, we just assume because it's moving
faster at THIS MOMENT, it's going to keep

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.530
doing so -- aaaaand WE SWITCH BACK TO THE
FIRST LINE AWW CRAP SO STUPID.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.900
Of course, there ARE times when one line is
moving faster, but the chances of you doing

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:43.090
all the math to catch on are slim, because
it's so much easier to assume!

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:50.030
What if I told you an engineer from early-20th
century Denmark solved these line-waiting

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.830
woes… but we humans are so dumb about lines,
we almost NEVER use the SIMPLE solution.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:56.830
Yeah.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.720
Which is better, a line for every cashier,
or one long line that feeds ALL the cashiers?

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.460
If you said the long line, you're right.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.910
Some of you are probably having anxiety just
THINKING about the one long line snaking back

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.290
and forth… but that's more efficient!

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.820
In the early 1900s, the Copenhagen telephone
exchange wanted to use the fewest number of

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.970
lines to route in and out of the community.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:25.350
One long distance line for the town wasn't
enough, but a line for every house would be

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.030
wasteful.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.890
To solve the problem, an engineer created
an algorithm to figure with the average time

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.650
per call, and average number of calls per
hour the minimum number of lines needed to

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.120
connect 99-percent of calls right away.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.380
It was seven lines for the whole town, by
the way.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.380
Not too many!

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.550
This is EXACTLY the same as waiting in line
at the cash-register.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.550
It's BETTER!

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.120
MAKE A SINGLE LINE PEOPLE.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.080
Where's the worst/best line ever?

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.180
How do you feel about the single line?!

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.290
Happy Holidays everyone!

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.950
While you're in line, tweet at us, watch DNews,
or tell the other people how they're too self-obsessed

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.580
to do line-math properly.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:09.010
That should entertain you enough during your
wait…
