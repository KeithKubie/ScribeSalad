00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.250
My name is Manolo Diaz and
I'm the CEO and co-founder

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.640
of Yogome, a startup
that develops

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.490
mobile educational games
for kids ages six to 11.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.520
We are based here in
Mexico City but we also

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.950
have offices in Silicon Valley.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.610
Actually the
company's from the US,

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.570
but we increased the production
team, developers, illustrators

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.840
here in Mexico City.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.600
In terms of mobile games,
there's a lot of competition,

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.670
and we think it's fair for users
to try our games first and then

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.900
decide if they want to get
the full version of one

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.675
of our games, especially
since we are a new studio.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.760
Now some people know
Yogome, but compared

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.690
to Disney or other competition,
we are actually nothing

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.550
so we have to show the user
and the parents our quality.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.740
So that's why our games
at the beginning are free,

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.920
and then if kids want to
continue playing the game,

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.530
parents have to pay for the
full version of the game.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.710
And so far that has
been working really good

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.460
so we are very
happy of doing that.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.080
There's a lot of
things that you have

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.740
to consider when you're
part of a start up.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.420
But don't take too much
time thinking about that,

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.920
just go after it.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.400
Something that has
helped us in the process

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.060
is trying to focus on
what we really want to do.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.510
There's a lot of
opportunities out there.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.010
There's a lot of
clients that want

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.690
to take your games into another
market or try different stuff,

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.890
but if you don't focus you're
going to lose a lot of time.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.920
And when you're small, when
you have a limited budget,

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.540
you have to understand
what next milestone

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.400
you need to accomplish in order
to show that your product is

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.350
working, in order to get that
seed round, that series A.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.940
So just try to understand
what works best for you

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.690
and just go after that.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.520
And be open.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.580
Share your project,
share your idea.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.610
Don't worry about, hey, they
are going to steal my idea.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.470
That doesn't happen.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.545
There's a lot of work
to do with execution.

00:02:39.545 --> 00:02:41.920
It's what makes a difference.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.960
Ideas-- there's dozens
of ideas, but if you

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.530
focus on the execution and
you know what you need to do

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.690
and you share with more people
and you invite more people

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.550
to be part of the
team, I'm pretty

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.640
sure you can accomplish
really great things.
