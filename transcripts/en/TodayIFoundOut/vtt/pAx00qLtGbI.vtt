00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.410
Who was the Real Mother Goose?

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.680
A nursery necessity and childhood favourite,
Mother Goose is a household name and the writer

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.780
of dozens of well-known nursery rhymes like
Baa Baa Black Sheep, Jack and Jill Went Up

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.630
the Hill, Pat-a-Cake, and Three Blind Mice.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.460
However, you may be disappointed to learn
that according to most historians, the author

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.699
“Mother Goose” was not a real person.

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:25.779
The name was likely given as something of
a generic moniker for an “everywoman”

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.189
type person.

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.409
The rhymes and fairy tales attributed to “her”
were actually written by numerous authors,

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:36.500
both men and women, and handed down in the
form of folk tales for generations.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.110
With a history that is several centuries old,
the origin stories of “Mother Goose” are

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.070
just as varied as the lyrics of the nursery
rhymes.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.440
While an 8th century French queen has been
called the “real” Mother Goose, it is

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.620
more likely that the name originated around
the 17th century, with the first documented

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:57.100
reference being in 1650 in the publication
of La Muse Historique by Jean Loret.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.490
The papers contained the phrase “like a
Mother Goose story.”

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.850
Nearly fifty years later, Charles Perrault
published a book in French called “Histories

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.929
and Tales from Long Ago, with Morals” which
was an anthology of eight fairy tales including

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:12.170
“Sleeping Beauty” and “Cinderella.”

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.719
On the front was a picture of an old woman
and a placard that read, “Tales of my Mother

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:18.689
the Goose.”

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.369
In 1729, Charles Perrault’s compilation
was translated into English and paved the

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:28.219
way for John Newbery’s publication of “Mother
Goose’s Melody: or Sonnets for the Cradle”

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:29.409
in 1765.

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.829
The book was small and filled with traditional
rhymes that children learn to this day.

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:38.049
Many different editions of the book became
popular in England and America, some including

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:39.460
different rhymes.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.579
Newbery is considered one of the most important
people in popularizing the name “Mother

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.299
Goose” and provided a stepping stone from
“Mother Goose tales” to “Mother Goose

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.149
rhymes” with his book.

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.770
For those who have persisted on believing
Mother Goose was once a real person, rather

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.340
than simply an invented “everymother”
name, there are two widely accepted theories

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.310
as to the identity of the “real” Mother
Goose, though both are highly unlikely.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.759
The first is the aforementioned French queen,
Bertrada of Laon, who lived in the 700s.

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.610
She was the mother of Charlemagne and bore
the nickname “Goose-foot Bertha.”

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.010
However, while the earlier date could mean
that Loret referred to her in La Muse Historique,

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.470
there is little information on whether Queen
Bertrada spun tales and stories, so stating

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.310
that she was “Mother Goose” is pure speculation,
with no supporting evidence other than the

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.640
connection of a “Goose” nickname.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.790
The more well-known theory, which can easily
be proved false, is that the woman was Elizabeth

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.880
Goose, a Bostonian woman whose great-grandson
was Isaiah Thomas, a publisher.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.040
Elizabeth married Isaac Goose in 1692 at the
age of 27, adding her six children to his

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.040
ten.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.200
With sixteen children to care for, Elizabeth
became adept at telling stories and singing

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.200
rhymes.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.340
The claim that she was the real Mother Goose
arose in 1860, but there is no substantial

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.970
proof that the woman was the originator of
so many of today’s childhood favourites.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.620
Supposedly, there is a “ghost volume”
of tales attributed to Mrs. Goose, but scholars

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.820
have been searching for evidence of its existence
for years and have found nothing.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.510
More to the point, Elizabeth Goose was not
yet born when Jean Loret made the earliest

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.610
recorded comment about “Mother Goose”
in 1650, so it is unlikely that Elizabeth

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.970
was the real thing, even if she did contribute
a story or two (of which there is no evidence

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.520
to support that).

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.920
The idea that Elizabeth Goose is the real
Mother Goose is so widespread, however, that

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.590
her alleged gravestone has become a tourist
attraction in Boston.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.330
To add more humor to the ordeal, it is likely
that these tourists are not only misled that

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.600
the woman was “Mother Goose”, but also,
Elizabeth’s grave is unmarked, and the grave

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.740
they are visiting is actually that of a Mary
Goose.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.431
Lacking substantial evidence to prove either
Elizabeth Goose or Queen Bertha is the real

00:03:50.431 --> 00:03:55.110
Mother Goose, it is generally thought far
more likely that the name originated around

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.710
the 17th century, possibly even with Loret,
as an “everywoman/mother” name to assign

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.370
as the author of so many tales and rhymes
that mothers the world over have been telling

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.540
their children throughout history.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.040
The story of the “woman” since then proceeded
to take on a life of its own.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.500
Even if there was at some point a real Mrs.
Goose being referred to, the Mother Goose

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.090
rhymes and stories we know today are from
a multitude of authors who have been published

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.780
without their names attributed to their work.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.060
Bonus Fact:
• John Newbery is also called “the father

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.060
of children’s literature” because he was
the first person to make children’s literature

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.540
a profitable part of the publishing market.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.770
The Newbery Medal, which is awarded to authors
of “distinguished American literature for

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:52.000
children,” is named after him.
