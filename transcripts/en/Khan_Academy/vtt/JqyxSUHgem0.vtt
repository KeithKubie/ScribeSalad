00:00:01.046 --> 00:00:03.484
- [Voiceover] So this
video is about the multiple

00:00:03.484 --> 00:00:07.617
choice section on the
AP U.S. history exam.

00:00:07.617 --> 00:00:10.032
And now I know you're thinking

00:00:10.032 --> 00:00:13.152
Whoa, Kim, this is a
multiple choice section.

00:00:13.152 --> 00:00:16.147
How much help could we
possibly need with this?

00:00:16.147 --> 00:00:18.910
Either you know the answer or you don't.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.186
Au contraire mon ami.

00:00:21.186 --> 00:00:24.506
Thankfully the multiple
choice section on this exam

00:00:24.506 --> 00:00:27.780
is not just a laundry list of facts

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.777
that you know or you don't know

00:00:29.777 --> 00:00:31.844
or you just leave blank.

00:00:31.844 --> 00:00:33.167
What's really great about the way

00:00:33.167 --> 00:00:35.466
these questions are designed

00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:38.717
is that they really reward
you for having intuition

00:00:38.717 --> 00:00:41.642
about what's going on in any time period

00:00:41.642 --> 00:00:43.523
in American history.

00:00:43.523 --> 00:00:46.054
So you might not necessarily need to know

00:00:46.054 --> 00:00:50.095
a pop quiz of facts about
slavery in the 19th century,

00:00:50.095 --> 00:00:54.117
but if you have a general idea of who

00:00:54.117 --> 00:00:55.610
the major players are,

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.305
what the major ideas are,

00:00:57.305 --> 00:00:59.767
then you'll actually
prosper in this section,

00:00:59.767 --> 00:01:01.322
more than you might think.

00:01:01.322 --> 00:01:04.596
So let's take a look at
these quotes over here.

00:01:04.596 --> 00:01:07.058
Now each of the questions
on the multiple choice

00:01:07.058 --> 00:01:10.332
portion of the exam will relate back to

00:01:10.332 --> 00:01:14.117
a series of quotes like
this or maybe a chart

00:01:14.117 --> 00:01:16.694
or a political cartoon.

00:01:16.694 --> 00:01:18.459
The good news is that they're not

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:20.177
just independent of each other.

00:01:20.177 --> 00:01:23.358
They're always going to
relate back to that chart,

00:01:23.358 --> 00:01:26.075
that graph, that political cartoon.

00:01:26.075 --> 00:01:29.804
So these two quotes

00:01:29.804 --> 00:01:32.464
are actually related to four questions,

00:01:32.464 --> 00:01:35.529
and each set of quotes or cartoon

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:37.457
will have about two to four questions

00:01:37.457 --> 00:01:38.827
that go with it.

00:01:38.827 --> 00:01:42.101
So you should really spend
a lot of time reading

00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:45.096
these documents and
reading them carefully.

00:01:45.096 --> 00:01:47.139
And before you even go about trying

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:48.904
to answer the questions,

00:01:48.904 --> 00:01:52.712
try to get a sense of who the
people are who are speaking,

00:01:52.712 --> 00:01:54.291
what their main points are,

00:01:54.291 --> 00:01:56.683
and how they're making their argument,

00:01:56.683 --> 00:01:59.725
before you even take a stab
at any of the questions.

00:01:59.725 --> 00:02:02.116
So let's do that with what we have here.

00:02:02.116 --> 00:02:05.483
So this is a real practice
question from the AP exam,

00:02:05.483 --> 00:02:07.457
and it consists of two quotes,

00:02:07.457 --> 00:02:10.174
one from James Henry Hammond,

00:02:10.174 --> 00:02:13.169
and one from Frederick Douglass.

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:16.164
Now Douglass you've
probably heard of before.

00:02:16.164 --> 00:02:18.881
James Henry Hammond maybe not so much.

00:02:18.881 --> 00:02:21.139
All right, well first let's think about

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:22.156
where they are in time.

00:02:22.156 --> 00:02:25.383
So we've got Hammond in 1845

00:02:25.383 --> 00:02:28.797
and Douglass in 1852.

00:02:28.797 --> 00:02:31.444
So it's the late Antebellum Period

00:02:31.444 --> 00:02:34.485
getting into the period
just before the Civil War.

00:02:34.485 --> 00:02:36.157
We know there are a lot of arguments

00:02:36.157 --> 00:02:38.410
about slavery and whether it should exist

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.989
at this time period.

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.636
So, all right, that's
a pretty easy baseline

00:02:42.636 --> 00:02:44.493
for where we are in time.

00:02:44.493 --> 00:02:46.444
Okay, now where are we in space?

00:02:46.444 --> 00:02:48.464
Well we know that James Henry Hammond

00:02:48.464 --> 00:02:50.739
is from South Carolina.

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.063
What about Frederick Douglass?

00:02:52.063 --> 00:02:54.849
Do we have any clues as to where he is?

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.496
Well, there's nothing listed here,

00:02:57.496 --> 00:03:00.306
but let's move into who
these people actually are.

00:03:00.306 --> 00:03:02.280
So we've got Frederick Douglass

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.972
and he's a pretty key
figure in American history.

00:03:05.972 --> 00:03:09.455
So Frederick Douglass we know was

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:13.240
a former enslaved person who escaped

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.252
and he was very active

00:03:18.252 --> 00:03:21.201
in the abolitionist movement.

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:24.800
The abolitionists were the group of

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.445
mostly Northern intellectuals who believed

00:03:28.445 --> 00:03:31.534
that slavery should be
ended right this minute

00:03:31.534 --> 00:03:33.345
everywhere in the United States,

00:03:33.345 --> 00:03:34.529
if not the world.

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:36.921
So this is probably a pretty good clue

00:03:36.921 --> 00:03:40.817
that we're looking at
someone from the North.

00:03:40.817 --> 00:03:43.236
What about James Henry Hammond?

00:03:43.236 --> 00:03:44.560
Have you heard of him before?

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.786
Probably not, but we do
know some things about him.

00:03:48.786 --> 00:03:51.967
We know that he's in South Carolina,

00:03:51.967 --> 00:03:54.939
southern part of the country.

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:57.377
And we know that he's a governor,

00:03:57.377 --> 00:04:00.025
so we can reasonably assume that

00:04:00.025 --> 00:04:02.718
he's pretty elite.

00:04:02.718 --> 00:04:05.551
We can be pretty certain
since this is before

00:04:05.551 --> 00:04:09.105
the Civil War that he's white.

00:04:10.025 --> 00:04:13.562
So you see that I'm
making some assumptions

00:04:13.562 --> 00:04:16.418
about who James Henry Hammond is here.

00:04:16.418 --> 00:04:19.251
I think he's probably a wealthy person.

00:04:19.251 --> 00:04:21.452
I think he's probably white.

00:04:21.452 --> 00:04:23.194
And you may be saying to yourself

00:04:23.194 --> 00:04:24.027
whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:04:24.027 --> 00:04:26.860
What if James Henry Hammond was

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.507
the one exception to the rule

00:04:29.507 --> 00:04:31.806
and he was from the working class

00:04:31.806 --> 00:04:34.987
or he was that one
African American governor

00:04:34.987 --> 00:04:38.122
that we never talk about
from before the Civil War?

00:04:38.122 --> 00:04:40.165
Basically the question you're asking is

00:04:40.165 --> 00:04:41.558
could this be a trick?

00:04:41.558 --> 00:04:43.602
And the answer is generally no.

00:04:43.602 --> 00:04:47.178
Almost never is the AP U.S. history exam

00:04:47.178 --> 00:04:50.405
going to try to trick
you with that one strange

00:04:50.405 --> 00:04:52.054
exception to the rule,

00:04:52.054 --> 00:04:55.189
because they want you
to build this intuition.

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:56.280
They want to say

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.927
all right, what do you
know about American history

00:04:58.927 --> 00:05:00.970
and how can you fit these questions

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.549
into that rubric?

00:05:02.549 --> 00:05:04.894
You even have kind of a
clue that you probably

00:05:04.894 --> 00:05:06.450
shouldn't know who this guy is

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.261
because they have to explain who he is

00:05:08.261 --> 00:05:09.237
in the first place.

00:05:09.237 --> 00:05:10.049
Right?

00:05:10.049 --> 00:05:12.673
They have to say this was a
governor of South Carolina.

00:05:12.673 --> 00:05:14.020
Whereas Frederick Douglass,

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.645
you can be pretty sure
that you've heard of him

00:05:15.645 --> 00:05:17.433
and you know what he was about.

00:05:17.433 --> 00:05:20.011
So trust your instincts
here because people

00:05:20.011 --> 00:05:22.797
are gonna be more or less who they seem

00:05:22.797 --> 00:05:25.096
in these circumstances.

00:05:25.096 --> 00:05:27.395
All right, let's finally
read these quotes.

00:05:27.395 --> 00:05:30.042
"Still though a slaveholder,
I freely acknowledge

00:05:30.042 --> 00:05:32.735
"my obligations as a man and I am bound

00:05:32.735 --> 00:05:35.127
"to treat humanely the fellow creatures

00:05:35.127 --> 00:05:37.983
"whom God has entrusted to my charge.

00:05:37.983 --> 00:05:40.235
"It is certainly in the interest of all

00:05:40.235 --> 00:05:42.511
"and I am convinced it is the desire

00:05:42.511 --> 00:05:45.019
"of every one of us to treat our slaves

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:47.248
"with proper kindness."

00:05:47.248 --> 00:05:49.059
All right, so what is he saying here?

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:52.681
First, he's saying he
himself is a slaveholder,

00:05:52.681 --> 00:05:55.909
so we've got a good idea of who he is.

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:58.904
He's a wealthy, white
person who owns slaves

00:05:58.904 --> 00:06:00.553
in the South.

00:06:00.553 --> 00:06:04.690
So we can guess that he's
probably pro-slavery.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.918
What else is he saying?

00:06:09.918 --> 00:06:13.610
He's saying that slaveholders should treat

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.432
enslaved people with kindness.

00:06:17.432 --> 00:06:20.543
All right, he says that he's
convinced it's the desire

00:06:20.543 --> 00:06:22.377
of every one of us.

00:06:22.377 --> 00:06:24.251
Well, this doesn't quite seem to jive

00:06:24.251 --> 00:06:27.502
with what we know about
slavery in the South.

00:06:27.502 --> 00:06:30.288
It's a cruel and terrible institution.

00:06:30.288 --> 00:06:33.330
So it sounds like Hammond might be making

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.831
kind of an excuse for slavery?

00:06:38.764 --> 00:06:42.961
Or at least say maybe
slavery is not so bad?

00:06:49.282 --> 00:06:50.838
And I think there's one other thing

00:06:50.838 --> 00:06:52.254
kind of lurking in here,

00:06:52.254 --> 00:06:56.179
which is this idea that God has trusted

00:06:56.179 --> 00:06:59.476
fellow creatures to his charge.

00:06:59.476 --> 00:07:03.145
So he's almost saying that God made

00:07:03.145 --> 00:07:04.816
the system of slavery.

00:07:04.816 --> 00:07:07.185
That the way things
are is the way that God

00:07:07.185 --> 00:07:08.601
wanted them to be.

00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:12.340
So this is almost a religious
argument for slavery,

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.080
saying God wanted it to be this way,

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.354
God has entrusted these
people to his care.

00:07:18.354 --> 00:07:20.351
So what's Frederick Douglass saying here?

00:07:20.351 --> 00:07:24.043
He's saying, "Standing
with God and the crushed

00:07:24.043 --> 00:07:27.572
"and bleeding slave on
this occasion, I will,

00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:30.358
"in the name of humanity
which is outraged,

00:07:30.358 --> 00:07:32.913
"and in the name of
Liberty which is fettered,

00:07:32.913 --> 00:07:35.165
"in the name of the
constitution and Bible,

00:07:35.165 --> 00:07:37.255
"which are disregarded and trampled upon,

00:07:37.255 --> 00:07:40.204
"dare to call in question
and denounce slavery

00:07:40.204 --> 00:07:43.454
"'the great sin and shame of America'!"

00:07:43.454 --> 00:07:44.731
Well, I'm gonna go out on a limb here

00:07:44.731 --> 00:07:48.842
and say that Douglass does not agree

00:07:48.842 --> 00:07:50.599
with Hammond.

00:07:50.599 --> 00:07:54.709
So I think these two
quotes are pretty much

00:07:54.709 --> 00:07:56.869
diametrically opposed.

00:07:56.869 --> 00:08:00.236
So where Hammond says that God entrusted

00:08:00.236 --> 00:08:02.743
enslaved people to his care,

00:08:02.743 --> 00:08:05.390
Douglass is saying he's standing with God

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:09.686
and the crushed Bible to say that slavery

00:08:09.686 --> 00:08:14.185
is condemned by Christianity.

00:08:21.853 --> 00:08:23.038
What else is he saying?

00:08:23.038 --> 00:08:25.360
Well, he's saying liberty
and the constitution

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.078
are being trampled upon,

00:08:27.078 --> 00:08:31.219
so that there's a
patriotic appeal maybe also

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:35.623
for why the Declaration of Independence

00:08:35.623 --> 00:08:38.672
and the idea of all men are created equal

00:08:38.672 --> 00:08:41.458
is not compatible with slavery.

00:08:41.458 --> 00:08:43.223
So while Hammond is saying

00:08:43.223 --> 00:08:46.218
oh, I think that all people who own slaves

00:08:46.218 --> 00:08:48.726
desire to treat them kindly

00:08:48.726 --> 00:08:51.582
and God has entrusted us with slaves,

00:08:51.582 --> 00:08:54.747
this is the natural order
meant by the Almighty.

00:08:54.747 --> 00:08:56.001
Douglass is saying,

00:08:56.001 --> 00:08:59.228
no, this is the great
sin and shame of America.

00:08:59.228 --> 00:09:02.572
It is not a Christian
institution and it is not

00:09:02.572 --> 00:09:04.592
an institution which is compatible

00:09:04.592 --> 00:09:06.682
with the ideals of the United States.

00:09:06.682 --> 00:09:08.911
So we've got a ton of information

00:09:08.911 --> 00:09:10.281
out of these documents

00:09:10.281 --> 00:09:11.373
and we haven't even looked at

00:09:11.373 --> 00:09:13.323
a multiple choice question yet.

00:09:13.323 --> 00:09:15.041
All right, are you ready to take some on?

00:09:15.041 --> 00:09:16.899
Let's do it.

00:09:16.899 --> 00:09:20.080
All right, this is an
actual AP practice question,

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.868
and the first thing you want to do

00:09:21.868 --> 00:09:23.749
when you're approaching
one of these questions

00:09:23.749 --> 00:09:26.512
is to read it really carefully.

00:09:26.512 --> 00:09:29.414
So the excerpt from James Henry Hammond

00:09:29.414 --> 00:09:33.037
is most clearly an example
of which of the following

00:09:33.037 --> 00:09:35.753
developments in the mid-19th century?

00:09:35.753 --> 00:09:39.376
All right, so we're
only looking at Hammond.

00:09:39.376 --> 00:09:41.117
And we're specifically thinking about

00:09:41.117 --> 00:09:42.603
the mid-19th century,

00:09:42.603 --> 00:09:44.972
so put ourselves there in time,

00:09:44.972 --> 00:09:46.945
that kind of 1850s era.

00:09:46.945 --> 00:09:49.453
Let's go through the
possible answers one by one,

00:09:49.453 --> 00:09:50.939
and if we don't like something,

00:09:50.939 --> 00:09:53.215
we will cross it out right away.

00:09:53.215 --> 00:09:54.538
All right, option A.

00:09:54.538 --> 00:09:56.953
The decline of slavery in Southern states

00:09:56.953 --> 00:10:00.320
as a result of gradual emancipation laws.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:05.095
All right, so says that
slavery was declining

00:10:05.095 --> 00:10:08.087
as a result of gradual emancipation laws.

00:10:08.087 --> 00:10:09.735
Well, I don't think
that can be true, right?

00:10:09.735 --> 00:10:10.618
Because if anything,

00:10:10.618 --> 00:10:13.240
slavery's getting stronger
before the Civil War.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.957
I don't remember any
gradual emancipation laws

00:10:15.957 --> 00:10:17.071
in the South.

00:10:17.071 --> 00:10:19.693
So let's get rid of that.

00:10:19.693 --> 00:10:21.039
All right, option B.

00:10:21.039 --> 00:10:23.872
The increasingly restrictive
nature of slavery

00:10:23.872 --> 00:10:27.587
in the South enforced
by stronger slave codes.

00:10:27.587 --> 00:10:30.095
Well, there certainly
were more slave codes

00:10:30.095 --> 00:10:33.207
in the 1850s and they
were pretty restrictive,

00:10:33.207 --> 00:10:36.341
but is that what the
excerpt is talking about?

00:10:36.341 --> 00:10:38.808
No, he's talking about kindness

00:10:38.808 --> 00:10:42.198
and that slave owners should
treat their slaves kindly,

00:10:42.198 --> 00:10:44.288
so that's probably not the right one,

00:10:44.288 --> 00:10:46.122
but let's leave it on the table for now

00:10:46.122 --> 00:10:48.351
just in case there's not a better answer.

00:10:48.351 --> 00:10:50.720
The expanding use of moral arguments

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.460
by Northern anti-slavery activists.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.062
Well, Hammond is a Southerner,

00:10:55.062 --> 00:10:58.452
so I'm gonna go with no.

00:10:59.532 --> 00:11:01.112
All right, option D.

00:11:01.112 --> 00:11:03.898
The growing tendency among
Southern slaveholders

00:11:03.898 --> 00:11:06.569
to justify slavery as a positive good.

00:11:06.569 --> 00:11:08.473
Yeah, I think that's
actually the best option.

00:11:08.473 --> 00:11:09.239
Right?

00:11:09.239 --> 00:11:11.607
Because he's saying God intended this,

00:11:11.607 --> 00:11:14.162
we're trying to treat them with kindness.

00:11:14.162 --> 00:11:16.902
So it's a very pro-slavery argument

00:11:16.902 --> 00:11:21.499
made on the grounds that
slavery is a good institution.

00:11:21.499 --> 00:11:25.122
Now it's worth noting
that one of these options,

00:11:25.122 --> 00:11:27.931
option B, what it says is true.

00:11:27.931 --> 00:11:31.391
But it's not a clear
example of what Hammond

00:11:31.391 --> 00:11:33.086
is saying in the excerpt,

00:11:33.086 --> 00:11:35.733
so make sure that you're
answering the question

00:11:35.733 --> 00:11:37.985
that you're actually being asked,

00:11:37.985 --> 00:11:41.399
not just looking for what
could be factually true

00:11:41.399 --> 00:11:43.790
among the answers.

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:45.718
All right, I think this
is enough for this video,

00:11:45.718 --> 00:11:47.273
but stay tuned to the next video

00:11:47.273 --> 00:11:49.711
and we'll do a few more examples.
