00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.000
Say it's late at night, you're home alone
drifting off to sleep, just, entering that

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.769
dream about Fritos, and then suddenly there's
a banging at the door!

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:12.809
Suddenly you're wide awake and it feels like
your heart's gonna explode.

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.900
You jump up ready to run out the back door,
possibly grab a Phillips head screwdriver

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.790
and stab it into the darkness until it sticks
into something.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.750
Now whether it's a Weeping Angel or your neighbor
looking to borrow a can of beans, it doesn't

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.170
really matter because when you heard that
sudden noise, your startled brain released

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.580
an icy typhoon of chemicals.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.900
And everything that's now going through your
mind, like your urge to flee, your urge to

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.150
defend yourself, that internal debate about
whether Weeping Angels are even real and "Woah!

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.170
Where's the cat?"

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.170
All that?

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.850
Is just a result of those chemicals.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.040
Our brains and our nervous systems and the
substances they produce and are always bathed

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.890
in are amazingly complex nuanced systems.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.180
And even though we're always talking about
our mental activities being somehow separate

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.750
from all the biological stuff going on in
our bodies, in reality, the moods, ideas,

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.720
impulses, that flash through our minds are
spurred by our biological condition.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.820
As psychologists like to say, "Everything
psychological is biological."

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.380
So one way to understand how your mind works
is to look at how the chemistry of your body

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.630
influences how you think, sense, and feel
about the world around you.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.040
To do that, we begin at the simplest level,
the system with the smallest parts, it's all

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.330
about the neuron, baby.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.110
[Intro]

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.840
Neurons, or nerve cells, are the building
blocks that comprise our nervous systems.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.250
Neurons share the same basic makeup as our
other cells, but they have electrochemical

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.729
mojo that lets them transmit messages to each
other.

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.380
Your brain alone is made up of billions of
neurons, and to understand why we think or

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.150
dream or do anything, you gotta first understand
how these little transmitters work.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.650
You actually have several different types
of neurons in your body, from ones that are

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.780
less than a millimeter long in your brain
to ones that run the whole length of your

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.780
leg!

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.360
Yes, you have cells as long as your legs,
which is nothing compared to the hundred and

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.820
fifty feet the nerve cells of some dinosaurs
had to be, I'm getting off topic, sorry.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.780
No matter how big a nerve is, they all have
the same three basic parts: the soma, dendrites,

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.780
and axon.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.689
The soma, or cell body, is basically the neuron's
life support; it contains all that necessary

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:23.950
cell action like the nucleus, DNA, mitochondria,
ribosomes, and such.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.109
So, if the soma dies, the whole neuron goes
with it.

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:31.519
The dendrites, as bushy and branch-like as
the trees they're named after, receive messages

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.579
and gossip from other cells.

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.620
They're the listeners, whispering what they
hear back to the soma.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.360
The axon is the talker.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.220
This long, cable-like extension transmits
electrical impulses from the cell body out

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.849
to other neurons or glands or muscles.

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.189
Whereas the dendrites are short and bushy,
the axon fiber is long, and, depending on

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:54.689
what type of neuron it is, is sometimes encased
in a protective layer of fatty tissue, called

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:55.879
the myelin sheath.

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:00.439
It's almost like an insulated electrical wire,
the myelin sheath speeds up the transmission

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:05.060
of messages, and if it degrades, as it does
with those affected with multiple sclerosis,

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.379
those signals are degraded as well, eventually
leading to lack of muscle control.

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:14.200
Neurons transmit signals either when stimulated
by sensory input or triggered by neighboring

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.200
neurons.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.359
The dendrites pick up the signal and activate
the neuron's action potential, or firing impulse,

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:24.359
that shoots an electrical charge down the
axon to its terminals and towards the neighboring

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:25.359
neurons.

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.299
The contact points between neurons are called
synapses.

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.129
All those bushy little dendrites are decorated
with synapses that almost but don't quite

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:37.870
touch the neighboring axon in the tiniest
game of "I'm not touching you!" of all time.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.919
They're less than a millionth of an inch apart.

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:42.809
And that microscopic cleft is called the synaptic
gap.

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:47.519
So, when an action potential runs down to
the end of an axon, it activates the chemical

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:53.229
messengers that jump that tiny synaptic gap,
flying like that little air kiss and landing

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:55.419
on the receptor sites of the receiving neuron.

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:57.980
Those messengers are neurotransmitters.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.840
Although neurotransmitters slide right into
their intended receptors like a key into a

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.670
lock, they don't stay bonded to the receiving
neuron.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.779
They just sort of pop out, having excited
or inhibited the receiving neuron's trigger,

00:04:08.779 --> 00:04:12.549
then the extras immediately get reabsorbed
by the neuron that released them in the first

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.549
place in a process called reuptake.

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.290
Kinda like, "Here you go, oh, psych!"

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.880
So neurons communicate with neurotransmitters
which in turn cause motion and emotion; they

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.910
help us move around, make jazz hands, learn,
feel, remember, stay alert, get sleepy, and

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.630
pretty much do everything we do.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.570
Some of them just make you feel good, like
the endorphins we get flooded with after running

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.100
ten miles or falling in love or eating a really
good piece of pie.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.660
We've got over 100 different kinds of these
brilliant neurotransmitters -- some are excitatory

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.070
and others are inhibitory, and all are good
reminders that everything psychological is

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.900
also biological.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.890
Excitatory neurotransmitters rev up the neuron,
increasing the chances it will fire off an

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.100
action potential.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.530
Norepinephrine is one you're probably familiar
with, it helps control alertness and arousal.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.400
Glutamate is another, involved in memory,
but an over-supply of it can wig out the brain

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.440
and cause seizures and migraines which is
why some people are sensitive to all that

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.250
MSG, or monosodium glutamate, in their Ramen.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.010
Inhibitory neurotransmitters on the other
hand, chill neurons out, decreasing the likelihood

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.800
that the neuron will jump into action.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.570
GABA– gamma-aminobutyric acid– is a major
inhibitory neurotransmitter, and you've probably

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.070
heard of serotonin which affects your mood
and hunger and sleep.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.100
Low amounts of serotonin are linked to depression,
and a certain class of antidepressants help

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.020
raise serotonin levels in the brain.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.950
Some neurotransmitters like acetylcholine
and dopamine play both sides and can both

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.170
excite or inhibit neurons depending on what
type of receptors they encounter.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:43.070
Acetylcholine enables muscle action and influences
learning and memory; Alzheimer's patients

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.620
experience a deterioration of their acetylcholine
producing neurons.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.970
Dopamine, meanwhile, is associated with learning,
movement, and pleasurable emotions, and excessive

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.320
amounts of it are linked to schizophrenia
as well as addictive and impulsive behavior.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.590
So neurotransmitters are basically your nervous
system's couriers.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.360
But they aren't the only chemical messengers
delivering the news; they've got some competition

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.900
brewing in the endocrine system.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.410
And if you've been through puberty, you know
what I'm talking about: hormones.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.830
Like neurotransmitters, hormones act on the
brain, and indeed some of them are chemically

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.730
identical to certain neurotransmitters.

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:20.950
Hormones affect our moods, arousal, and circadian
rhythm, they regulate our metabolism, monitor

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.830
our immune system, signal growth, and help
with sexual reproduction.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.510
You could say that most of them boil down
to the basics: attraction, appetite, and aggression.

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.410
Whereas neurons and synapses flick on and
off, sending messages with amazing speed,

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.820
the endocrine system likes to take its time,
delivering the body's slow chemical communications

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.260
through a set of glands that secrete hormones
into the bloodstream where they're ferried

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.470
to other tissues, especially the brain.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.990
So while the nervous and endocrine systems
are similar, in that they both produce chemicals

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.610
destined to hit up certain receptors, they
operate at very different speeds.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.120
It's like, if the nervous system wants to
get in touch with you, it sends you a text.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.690
But if the endocrine system has a message,
it will like lick the stamp, and put it on,

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:04.660
and write your address, and then a note and
a pen on paper, and then fold it up and put

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.080
and mail it to you with the Post Office.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.850
But fast isn't always better, and your body
will remember that letter longer than the

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:12.850
text.

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:13.850
Hormones, they linger.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.770
Which helps explain why it takes some time
to simmer down after a moment of severe fright

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:18.770
or anger.

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.820
And our endocrine systems have a few important
hormone brewing glands.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.830
We've got a pair of adrenal glands snuggled
up against our kidneys that secrete adrenaline,

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:30.120
that famous fight or flight hormone that jacks
up your heart rate, blood pressure and blood

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:34.630
sugar, giving you that tidal wave of energy
preparing you to run like heck or punch that

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:39.860
charging baboon in the throat; the pancreas
sits right next to the adrenal gland and oozes

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:44.500
insulin and glucagon hormones that monitor
how you absorb sugar, your bodies main source

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:45.500
of fuel.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.000
Your thyroid and parathyroid glands at the
base of your throat secrete hormones that

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.160
regulate your metabolism and monitor your
body's calcium levels; if you have testicles,

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.230
they're secreting your sex hormones like estrogen
and testosterone, and if you've got ovaries,

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:58.230
they're doing that job.

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:03.090
And all those glands are super important,
but there is one gland that rules them all,

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:05.830
and in the darkness binds them: the pituitary
gland.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:10.500
Although it's just a little pea-sized nugget
hidden deep in the bunker of the brain, it

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.830
is the most influential gland in this system.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:17.639
It releases a vital growth hormone that spurs
physical development and that love hormone,

00:08:17.639 --> 00:08:21.840
oxytocin, that promotes warm, fuzzy feelings
of trust and social bonding.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.790
What really makes the pituitary the master
gland is that its secretions boss around the

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:31.200
other endocrine glands, but even the pituitary
has a master in the hypothalamus region of

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.529
the brain, which we will talk more about next
episode.

00:08:33.529 --> 00:08:38.349
So, AHHHHHHHHH! if I managed to scare you,
sorry, but I'm illustrating a point.

00:08:38.349 --> 00:08:42.279
You have no control over being scared, but
maybe now you do understand a little more

00:08:42.279 --> 00:08:46.410
clearly how your nervous and endocrine systems
worked together to call the shots.

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:50.490
First, the sensory input from your eyes and
ears went to your brain, the simplest bits

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:55.620
of your hypothalamus without even letting
you analyze it and were like ahhhh, and then,

00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.160
that ran down the chain of command from your
pituitary to your adrenal glands, to the hormone

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:04.829
adrenaline, to the rest of your body and then
back to your brain, which then realized that

00:09:04.829 --> 00:09:08.690
I was just messing with you and told everybody
to just calm down for once!

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:13.059
The whole deal is a feedback loop: your nervous
system directs your endocrine system which

00:09:13.059 --> 00:09:16.550
directs your nervous system, brain, gland,
hormone, brain.

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:19.519
And of course each of these systems is fantastically
complex.

00:09:19.519 --> 00:09:21.199
Way more than we can get into here.

00:09:21.199 --> 00:09:25.579
So, in our next lesson, we're gonna get all
up in your brain, and delve deeper into the

00:09:25.579 --> 00:09:30.269
different components of your nervous system,
find out what your old brain is, and learn

00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:33.279
about how much of your brain you actually
use.

00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:36.529
