00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.360
Welcome back.

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.820
We just finished this problem
with the pulleys and the

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:04.490
inclined plane.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.890
And I just wanted to do one
final thing on this problem

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.430
just because I think
it's interesting.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.150
And then we can move onto
what seems like

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.810
a pretty fun problem.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.780
So the last thing I want to
figure out is, we figured out

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.720
that this 20 kilo-- actually,
the whole system will

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.860
accelerate up and to
the right at 4.13

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.260
meters per second squared.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.580
And then the second part of this
question is, what is the

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.485
tension in this rope
or this wire?

00:00:28.485 --> 00:00:30.990
And at first you might say,
this is complicated.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.940
You know, this thing isn't
static anymore.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.390
The thing is actually
accelerating.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.370
How do I do it?

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.900
Well this is how you
think about it.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.350
Just pick one part
of the system.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.430
Let's say that all we could see
was this 20 kilogram mass.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.340
So let's say all we could see
was this 20 kilogram mass.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.760
And we know it's suspended
from a wire.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.780
And we also know that this
20 kilogram mass is not

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.840
accelerating as fast
as it would if

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.980
the wire wasn't there.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.210
It's accelerating only at
4.13 meters per second.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.510
If the wire wasn't there, it'd
be accelerating at 9.8 meters

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.430
per second, the acceleration
of gravity.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.140
So the wire must be exerting
some upward

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.520
force on the object.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.306
And that is the force
of tension.

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:17.060
That is what's slowing-- that's
what's moderating its

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.090
acceleration from being 9.8
meters per second squared to

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.180
being 4.13 meters per
second squared.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.290
So essentially, what is the
net force on this object?

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.550
On just this object?

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.310
Well the net force is-- and
you can ignore what I said

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.100
before about the net force
in all the other places.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.050
But we know that the object
is accelerating downwards.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.400
Well, we know it's 20 kilograms.
So that's its mass.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.980
And we know that it's
accelerating downwards at 4.13

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.230
meters per second squared.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:02:00.460
So the net force, 20 times--
see, times 20 is 82-- let's

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.120
just say 83 Newtons.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.400
83 Newtons down.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.990
We know that the net force
is 83 Newtons down.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:16.520
We also know that the tension
force plus the force of

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.200
gravity-- and what's the
force of gravity?

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.780
The force of gravity is just
the weight of the object.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.680
So the force of tension, which
goes up, plus the weight of --

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.030
the force of gravity is equal
to the net force.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.010
And the way I set this up,
tension's going to be a

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.270
negative number.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.530
Just because I'm saying
positive numbers are

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.060
downwards, so a negative number
would be upwards.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:46.870
So tension will be what
is 83 minus 196?

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:54.800
Minus 196 is equal to
minus 113 Newtons.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.040
And the only reason why I got a
negative number is because I

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.150
used positive numbers
for downwards.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.520
So minus 113 Newtons downwards,
which is the same

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.160
thing as 113 Newtons upwards.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.530
And so that is the tension
in the rope.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.970
And you could have done the same
thing on this side of the

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.120
problem, although it would
have been-- well, yeah.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.290
You could have done the
exact same thing on

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.150
this side of the problem.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.750
You would've said, well what
would it have accelerated

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.870
naturally if there wasn't some
force of tension on this rope

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.230
going backwards?

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.090
And then you're saying, oh,
well, we know it would have

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.350
gone in this direction at some
acceleration, but instead it's

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.570
going in the other direction.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.090
So you use that.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.460
You figure out the net force,
and then you say the tension

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.840
plus all of these forces have
to equal the net force.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.200
And then you should solve
for the tension.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.510
And it would be the
same tension.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.760
Now we will do a fun and
somewhat simple, but maybe

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.780
instructive problem.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.860
So I have a pie.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.110
This is the pie.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.580
This is parallel.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.270
And I have my hand.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.070
You can tell that my destiny
was really to be a great

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.170
artist. This is my hand.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:10.100
And I'm holding a pie, and I'm
looking to smash this pie into

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.670
this individual's face.

00:04:19.382 --> 00:04:24.790
I actually was a, I was the
newspaper cartoonist in high

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.360
school, so I have some
minor-- but anyway.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.140
Let's make it a bald man.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.950
Well anyway, I shouldn't be
focusing on the drawing.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.650
He has a moustache.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.720
Anyway, I'm looking to throw
this pie into this guy's face.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.090
And the problem is, I need to
figure out how fast do I need

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.250
to accelerate this pie for
it to not fall down?

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.490
Right?

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:53.190
Because what's happening?

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.290
Well there's the force of
gravity on this pie.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.500
There's a force of gravity on
this pie and if I don't

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.220
accelerate it fast enough, it's
just going to slide down.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.000
And I'll never be able
to, It'll never

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.200
reach the guy's face.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.440
So I don't want this pie
to slide down at all.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.070
How fast do I have
to push on it?

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.640
Well, we know that the
coefficient of friction-- you

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.400
don't know this, but I know
that the coefficient of

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.700
friction between my hand and
the pie, the coefficient of

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:23.170
friction is equal to 0.8.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.290
So given that, how fast do
I have to accelerate it?

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.650
Well let's see what's
happening.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.720
So we have the force of
gravity pulling down.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.550
So let's say that the mass
of the pie is m.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.860
m equals mass.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.400
So what is the force of gravity

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.630
pulling down on the pie?

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:47.350
Well the force of gravity is
just equal to m times 9.8.

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:48.490
Right?

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.420
The force of gravity is
equal to m times 9.8.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.810
In order for this pie to not
move down, what do we know

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.950
about the net forces
on that pie?

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.330
Well we know the net forces
on that pie have to be 0.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.010
So what would be the
offsetting force?

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:05.630
Well, it would be the
force of friction.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.106
So we would have a force of
friction acting upwards.

00:06:08.106 --> 00:06:08.690
Right?

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.140
Because the force of friction
always acts opposite to the

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.540
direction that the thing
would move otherwise.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:20.190
So essentially, our force of
friction has to be greater

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.160
than, roughly, greater
than or equal to.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.710
Because if it's greater than,
it's not like the pie is going

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:25.400
to move up.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.410
Friction by itself will never
move something, it'll just

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:29.940
keep something from
being moved.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.250
But let's just figure
out the minimum.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.210
I won't do the whole
inequalities.

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.950
The force of friction has to
be equal similarly, to 9.8

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:42.390
times the mass of the pie.

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:46.680
So if the coefficient of
friction is 0.8, what is the

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.380
force that I have to apply?

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.830
Well, the force I have to apply
in this case is going to

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:53.970
be the normal force, right?

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:58.600
That's normal to the
bottom of the pie.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.170
Right?

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.270
My hand is now like the
surface of the ramp.

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.830
So this is the normal force.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.030
And we know that the force of
friction is equal to the

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.550
coefficient of friction times
the normal force.

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:12.960
I'm going to switch colors
because this is getting

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.300
monotonous.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.120
And the force of friction,
we know has to be

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.030
9.8 times the mass.

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.010
So 9.8 meters per second
times the mass.

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.420
9.8m is the force of friction.

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.830
And that has to equal to
coefficient of friction times

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:28.865
the normal force.

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:31.310
And remember, the normal force
is essentially the force that

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:33.472
I'm pushing the pie with.

00:07:33.472 --> 00:07:38.270
And we know this is 0.8, so we
have 9.8 times the mass--

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:43.100
that's not meters, that's the
mass-- is equal to 0.8 times

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.720
the normal force.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:51.960
So you have the normal force is
equal to 9.8 times the mass

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.500
divided by 0.8.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.320
What's 9.8 divided by 0.8?

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:05.200
9.8 divided by 0.8 is
equal to 12.25.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.580
So the normal force that
I have to apply is

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:12.890
12.25 times the mass.

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:14.860
So that's the force
I'm applying.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:15.540
It's time the mass.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.040
We don't know the
mass of the pie.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.570
So how fast am I accelerating
the pie?

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.590
Well, force is equal to mass
times acceleration.

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:29.540
This is the force, 12.25m--
that's the force-- is equal to

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.170
the mass times the

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:32.720
acceleration of the pie, right?

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.799
And it's the same pie that we're
dealing with the whole

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:35.970
time, so it's still m.

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:39.049
And you can take out m from both
sides of the equation.

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:42.380
So the acceleration, the rate at
which I have to change the

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.450
velocity, or the acceleration
that I have to apply to the

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:53.860
pie is 12.25 meters per
second squared.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:58.090
And so actually, I have to apply
more than 1g, right?

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:01.330
Because g is the force
of gravity.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:05.430
And gravity accelerates
something at 9.8 seconds-- 9.8

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:06.750
meters per second squared.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:09.870
So I have to do something at
12-- I have to push and

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:13.270
accelerate the pie at 12.25
meters per second squared.

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:16.720
So it's something a little over
1g in order for that pie

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.910
to not fall and in order for my
normal force to provide a

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:22.630
force of friction so that
the pie can reach

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:25.360
this bald man's face.
