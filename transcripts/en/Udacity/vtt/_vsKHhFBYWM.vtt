Are you ready, Dave?

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:02.870
&gt;&gt; Ready for what, Professor?

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.160
&gt;&gt; We're going to start some
serious number crunching now.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.660
&gt;&gt; What do you mean?

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.040
&gt;&gt; In this lesson, we're going
to unleash the power of Python.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.830
We're going to show folks some
tools that enable them to calculate

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.780
all kinds of important
statistics on time series data.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.940

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:21.450
