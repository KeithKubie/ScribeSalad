00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.549
 During an evening out while you are looking for love, nothing is better than the help of a friend. 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.630
 Also known as a 'wing man' or 'wing woman'. The name comes from jet pilots ... 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.030
 ... where it is the wingmans work to guarantee support and security for the pilot. The same dynamic ... 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.650
 ... applies when a friend helps another friend to approach a potential partner. But what is the ... 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.280
 ... science behind this strategy. And does a wingman actually work? 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.390
 Let's start from the beginning. You look better in a group than alone. A study has ... 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.440
 ... let candidates evaluate photos of 300 people and found that faces are a lot more attractive ... 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.650
 ... were in a group than when they were alone in the photo. 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.510
 Another good tactic that a group can use is that of a wild turkey. 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.070
 Wild turkeys approach women in a 'coalition'. Of these, 1 is dominant and the other turkeys ... 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.240
 ... are helpers. These aids have less colored feathers, so that the dominant turkey ... 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.400
 ... looks a lot better. This strategy almost doubles in success compared to ... 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.230
 ... with turkeys that go hunting themselves. 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.160
 Even male fireflies work together to attract women. Fireflies use bioluminescent ... 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.080
 ... flashing signals to get a partner's attention. If all males blink the same, the females respond ... 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.450
 ... 82% of the time. Compared to 3% if they do not blink synchronously. So maybe ... 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.909
 ... it's time for your group to think about a group dance? 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.260
 Certainly if you are the wingman of a Lancetmanakin. Males of this species of birds make groups ... 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.940
 ... with which they perform complex dances and jump over each other. But in the group ... 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:32.430
 ... there is an Alpha and a Beta bird. The Beta never bite. So why would you want to be a wingman? 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.400
 A study that examined the DNA of 457 birds, learned that the Beta birds, following the example of the Alpha ... 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.320
 ... had a higher chance of becoming an Alpha the following year. 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.850
 This strategy is widely used among men. But what about women? 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.299
 In many cultures, women are more selective and picky than men when it comes to partnership. 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.070
 So there are larger variations among the sexes. Because women spend much more time, for example ... 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.720
 ...pregnancy. That makes it important that they select their partner more wisely. 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.340
 When asked, the researchers found that more women were using the joint strategy ... 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.609
 .... then apply men. But this technique is mainly used to reject men where no ... 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:15.389
 ... is a romantic interest. Again, this varies from person to person and these investigations were ... 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:18.010
 ... only focused on heterosexual behavior. 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.279
 How far will your group go for you? Are they willing to lie? It turns out that the closer you are ... 

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:27.639
 ... bond with someone, the sooner they tend to lie to make you look better. 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:31.760
 That is why it is best to go out with your very best friends to come across better. 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.790
 If you are looking for love or a one-off thing when you are with friends, it is fun and often effective. 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.700
 But remember that finding romance does not have to be a strategic game where you are fooling someone ... 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.879
 have to take. If you are just yourself, you are more likely to find someone who likes you ... 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:43.779
 ... for you. 

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:47.549

 Recommend Andrea Wulf. A fascinating research about the relationship between environments of the world ... 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.389
