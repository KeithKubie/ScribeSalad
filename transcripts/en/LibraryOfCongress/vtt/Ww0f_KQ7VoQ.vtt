00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of Congress
in Washington D.C.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.420
&gt;&gt; And we are thrilled that you
could join us for our first Library

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.210 position:69%
of Congress online conference for educators.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:28.680 position:67%
We have a great lineup for the entire
program, but we are super proud to show off

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.990 position:66%
with our keynote speaker, Carol Highsmith.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.900 position:73%
I'm going to turn the program over to the
Director of Education Outreach, Lee Ann Potter,

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.960
and she's going to introduce
our very special guest to you.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.930
&gt;&gt; Thanks Kathy.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.410 position:67%
I really am delighted to be here as well
and tickled that all of you are joining us.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.780
Thrilled to be introducing two
of our guests this evening.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.670
The first is Carol Highsmith.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.970
Carol is a distinguished and richly
published American photographer.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.770
She has donated her work to the
Library of Congress since 1992.

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:11.090 position:66%
Starting in 2002, Highsmith provided scans
or photographs that she shot digitally

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.510
with new donations to allow rapid
online access throughout the world.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.380 position:59%
If you have poked around the library's
website at any length and stumbled

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.840
across some really extraordinary
photography in recent years,

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.910 position:70%
you are certainly familiar with Carol's work.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.860
Joining Carol is Helena Zinkham.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.550 position:75%
Helena is the chief of the Prints and
Photographs Division at the Library of Congress.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.700
Helene joined the Library Prints
and Photographs Division in 1984.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.140 position:69%
She fell in love with pictures while working
at the Maryland Historical Society in 1977,

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.000
and to this day, enjoys helping
people discover the rich resources

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.360 position:58%
in public collections of the library.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.130 position:69%
We are thrilled to have both of you with us
tonight and tickled that all of you are here

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.580 position:72%
and looking forward to an outstanding session.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.970
Thank you.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.840
&gt;&gt; Thank you Lee Ann.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:16.320 position:70%
Great pleasure on my part to be getting ready
to meet everyone and host this conversation.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.370 position:69%
The keynote session for the online
conference Library of Congress and teachers,

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.290 position:73%
unlike in the [inaudible] primary resources, it
offers all of us the opportunity to learn from

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.220
and talk with a prolific creator
of primary visual sources.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.730 position:69%
And so the theme for this afternoon will be
preserving our communities with photography.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.680
I probably should have mentioned
that my voice is Helena Zinkham.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.140
We'll meet Carol in just a moment.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.320 position:75%
I will ask the obvious questions on your behalf,
starting with how Carol became interested

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.870 position:70%
in photography, her historical mentor, how
she fell in love with the Library of Congress

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.760 position:66%
by photographing our magnificent Jefferson
Building in Washington D.C. And then,

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.400 position:69%
how her daily life work documenting historic
buildings evolved into a magnificent vision.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:16.520 position:75%
And she launched her journey to act on her dream
and create a visual profile of all 50 states

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.390 position:61%
and territories throughout our country.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.860 position:72%
And that's where we'll spend most of our time.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.140 position:59%
How Carol captures the essence of
communities, how an extraordinary body

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.470 position:58%
of primary sources is being created
that you can use and reuse right now.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.970
It's copyright-free and all
online at the Library of Congress.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.420 position:70%
We're going to take a look at several states,
then travel with Carol through Alabama,

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.240
followed by vanishing America,
communities as people,

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.200 position:69%
and the beauties in the natural environment.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.640
There's time at the end for
your questions, of course.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.280 position:69%
You can quiz Carol about the tools of her
trade or ask anything else you're interested

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.610 position:61%
in about using her archive or perhaps
even photographing your own communities

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.020
with students.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.700 position:73%
And I'm going to switch to our first slide now.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.430
And naturally enough, get
ready to say all aboard.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.300
Are you ready to ride?

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.970
I'll turn it over to Carol,
who can give us a quick hello.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.660
&gt;&gt; Hi Helena.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:24.770
Thank you so much.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.730
I'm honored and so excited to be
included in this landmark webinar.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.360 position:63%
You know, until I took up photography in
my 30s, I had barely picked up a camera.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.950
It was just that my dad was
always taking photographs of us,

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.410
so I think subconsciously
I was aware of photography.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.850 position:59%
I wasn't really a serious student, but
when I started in the world of work,

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.060 position:59%
all of a sudden I became very serious.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.920 position:58%
And I put myself through school
working in the broadcasting industry.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.890
And one day I won a trip
to Russia and also China.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.960 position:58%
Well, it's kind of hard to go to
those places, especially when I went,

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.510 position:75%
and not take really kind of amazing photographs.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.630
And so when I got back I thought,
you know, I like photography.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:14.910
This is interesting.

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:20.990
So I took some photography courses,
and one day on a class assignment,

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.690 position:61%
I took a friend into the Willard Hotel.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.350 position:61%
Now the Willard Hotel used to be grand.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.720
It was a hotel of presidents.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.500 position:69%
It was only two blocks from the White House.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.210
But when I went in there,
it was just a rat trap.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.300
It was a mess.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:44.150 position:64%
As a matter of fact, there were rats the
size of cats running around in the halls.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:49.910 position:56%
Thank goodness the Willard Hotel was
saved, and I was asked if I would

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.020 position:64%
like to photograph the whole restoration.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.730 position:59%
One day I noticed this man was
walking through with a whole mitt full

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.480 position:73%
of photographs, and I said to him, what's this?

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.270
What do you have?

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:05.760 position:69%
And he said well you know, there were no
architectural drawings for this grand hotel,

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.360
so we used photographs to
put it back together again.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.160
And he told me about this
woman, Frances Benjamin Johnston

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.000 position:66%
who had worked in the Willard during 1901.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.560 position:63%
And he told me that Frances had donated,
had given away her life's collections

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.810 position:66%
of photographs to the Library of Congress.

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.490
Well I was, my interest was piqued.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:39.320 position:73%
He invited me down to the library with him, and
I actually went down and saw this collection.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:46.380 position:63%
And what she had done was produced tens
of thousands of images on her big heavy,

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:51.170 position:67%
bulky eight by ten camera all over America.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:55.060 position:59%
Starting with photographs of four
sitting presidents and their families,

00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:00.240 position:66%
and then photographs of southern mansions
produced with a Carnegie Foundation grant.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.190 position:63%
And then photographs of African-American
schools and poor,

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.690
white mining communities and
American Indian families.

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.110
Okay, I was interested.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:16.260
Realizing, and this is by the
way a photograph that I had taken

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.320
in the Willard Hotel back in 1980.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:24.300 position:63%
Realizing that this woman had done, what
she had done for me was life-changing.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:30.120 position:72%
I told the curators of the Library of Congress
the day I went down to see her collection

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:34.760 position:61%
that I would like to photograph, that I
would like to follow in her footsteps.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:40.840 position:75%
That I would like to document America too and
give my work to the Library of Congress as well.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.200 position:64%
Well I think they thought I was a little
nutty, but anyway, that was the beginning

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:51.430
of my interest in following
Francis Benjamin Johnston.

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.460
&gt;&gt; Carol, this is Helena.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.920 position:67%
We're going to load up just a few portraits
of your mentor, your historical mentor,

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:03.560 position:58%
Miss Johnston so that everyone can
enjoy the size of her camera relative

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.890
to our cellphone photography today.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:11.100
But it sure looks like the
Willard Hotel turned out fine.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.310
The restoration.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.570
&gt;&gt; It was gorgeous.

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.020
It was gorgeous.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:21.620
&gt;&gt; About how many photographs would
you take in a building that size?

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:22.100
&gt;&gt; Well, you know.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.640
&gt;&gt; Do you remember?

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:23.970
&gt;&gt; Interesting.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:29.380
I was also trying to follow her in
every way, so I was also working

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.760
with a bulky four by five camera.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.480
Four inch by five inch film,
which was very slow.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.370 position:61%
And also, when you take interiors like
this, you have to light them correctly.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:43.700
So this might have taken five
hours just to light this.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:50.860 position:59%
So it wasn't, I maybe took during the,
I think I was in there four years,

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:55.850
maybe 500 to 1000 to 1500
images in the Willard Hotel.

00:08:55.850 --> 00:09:00.970 position:58%
But it wasn't like the type of images
I take today on digital photography.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:08.710
&gt;&gt; Alright Carol.

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:17.150 position:59%
While we wait for those next photos to
come up, I mentioned that you, well,

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:21.250 position:67%
you've been very complementary to the
Library of Congress, and I appreciate that.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:25.810
What we'll move on to, oh, it
looks like they're coming up now.

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:02.300
&gt;&gt; Anyway, while we're waiting,
let me continue to just chat

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:10.250 position:59%
about how [inaudible] Francis Benjamin
Johnston's work was and still is.

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:11.820
Well this is a photograph of her.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:15.380 position:56%
And you see how huge that camera is.

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.680 position:56%
I mean, how did she carry it around?

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.860
I have no idea.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.110 position:73%
Let me talk about the Library of Congress also.

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:39.920 position:70%
My dream of traveling America, leaving a mark
behind as Francis Benjamin Johnston had done,

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:45.870 position:70%
was also made fortunate, possible by a number
of fortunate things that happened to me.

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:50.110 position:61%
People at the Library of Congress
believed in me and also kind of took me

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:53.020 position:72%
under their wing, which was amazingly helpful.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:58.630 position:56%
They were interested in my Willard
Hotel experience and my photographs,

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:07.540 position:67%
and as I continued to document Pennsylvania
Avenue, they also were interested

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:11.520 position:64%
and decided they wanted those images too.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:20.700 position:66%
So it was very helpful that the Library
of Congress felt that this was as valuable

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:28.640
to have images in their collection
of current-day events,

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:34.830 position:58%
as valuable as what Francis Benjamin
Johnston had done during her lifetime

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:37.870
at the turn of the last century.

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:39.850
Look at these magnificent images.

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:46.270 position:61%
This, for instance, was a slide, a
black and white slide that she colored.

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:48.980
Look at these beautiful children.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.550
She did school children.

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:53.260
She loved school children.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:58.090 position:58%
So this was, you know, I look at this
and I just get chill bumps looking

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:00.980 position:67%
at these images and how beautiful they are.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:06.390
And remember they're on large
eight by ten film negatives.

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:07.570
Look at this salt mine.

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:12.410
I was just in an exhibition mine
in West Virginia the other day.

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:17.640 position:72%
And all I could think about was what it was
like for Francis to go in these old mines back

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.120 position:72%
when she went in with her eight by ten camera.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:29.120 position:61%
And these beautiful, beautiful historic
scenes of outbuildings of plantations

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:34.110
that Carnegie sent her down
to do all of the south.

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:37.720 position:73%
And many, many of these buildings are gone now.

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.260 position:58%
I know. I've tried to replicate some.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.090
And look at this.

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:44.000
You can see this one's almost gone.

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:48.690
Thank goodness that Francis
Benjamin Johnston recorded these.

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:52.640
Thank goodness she recorded them.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:57.670
And see, now, she moved on in age.

00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:00.750 position:70%
But she worked almost all the way to the end.

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:05.070 position:63%
She lived in New Orleans during her 80s.

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:12.960 position:75%
And believe it or not, she is buried about ten
minutes from where I live now in Washington D.C.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.230
&gt;&gt; Carol, this is Helena again.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:17.760
You should also tell them about
Miss Johnston's sense of humor.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:26.690 position:61%
In her 80s she called herself the
octo-geranium, a woman of great energy.

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:28.450
&gt;&gt; She was a character and a half.

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:29.830
She really was.

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:36.670 position:66%
But, you know, we should be indebted to
her for all she did for the United States,

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:40.320 position:59%
capturing our history the way she did.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.350
It just changed my life.

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:43.030
It really did.

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:49.490 position:59%
And seeing these images, I decided
that I should follow in her footsteps.

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:56.270 position:66%
You know, it's interesting, I could never
do what she did because much of it's gone.

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:58.970
But she couldn't do what I've done.

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:05.970
I photograph Washington [inaudible]
places from the air.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.390
I do aerials.

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:13.530 position:56%
I carry around a camera that's
lighter than what she lugged around.

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:19.440 position:61%
So now this is the Library of Congress.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:25.040
I was very fortunate that the
Library of Congress, library staff,

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:31.320
allowed me to go into the iconic
Thomas Jefferson Building.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.610 position:66%
It was such an experience for me to go in,

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:38.860
and it had never really been
photographed correctly because,

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:45.940 position:64%
I was able to go up on scaffolding and on
gurneys and get high up and show the art.

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:52.190 position:69%
Because my cameras were lighter and smaller,
and not the bulky eight by ten camera

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:55.120 position:63%
that Francis Benjamin Johnston had used.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:59.250
I was able to take in lighting
that was smaller and lighter.

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:08.860 position:72%
And so this beautiful building was captured in
a way that it had never been captured before.

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:13.340
And I'm just thrilled, I was
thrilled for the opportunity.

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:17.250
And it was just at the time that
digital photography was starting

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.500
to really make its mark.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:24.290 position:64%
So at the time I photographed the Library
of Congress I was using a digital camera

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:27.260
that it was actually 39 megapixels.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:33.660 position:58%
Now most digital cameras were maybe
5, 10 maybe at the most at that time.

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:34.960
And I was on 39.

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:40.000
So we were able to really
capture with fine quality.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.920
The cameras that I use today
are actually double that amount.

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:48.440
I'm working with the largest
megapixel camera made.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:51.820 position:63%
That it, in the commercial realm anyway.

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:57.110 position:72%
And so the quality is just eye-popping almost.

00:15:57.110 --> 00:16:03.700 position:59%
So it's really an adventure for me to
be able to work with these fine tools.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:10.110 position:72%
But because I was able to photograph the
Library of Congress Thomas Jefferson Building,

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:15.720 position:58%
I learned so much about photography
and digital photography at that time.

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:22.770 position:72%
&gt;&gt; Carol, I've also enjoyed talking with you
about how you've branched out from the library

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:26.260 position:64%
to many, many community public libraries.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:32.870 position:64%
One of the great symbols throughout our
John Adams building was actually the owl.

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:35.470
I hope is a sign of wisdom.

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:39.350
And [inaudible] we were looking
at her mosaic earlier.

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:43.810
But here we have the Frederick
County Public Library.

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:47.370
And talk just a little bit
about how you find libraries

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:51.260 position:63%
in different communities in the country.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:55.690 position:61%
&gt;&gt; You know, because the Library of
Congress, the staff, and you of course,

00:16:55.690 --> 00:17:02.580 position:72%
are so interested in me capturing small towns,
and every town that I can possibly get to.

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:05.910 position:73%
There always seems to be a sign to the library.

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:13.720 position:63%
And I always try to go there because our
libraries are so varied and interesting.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.010
Everything from, of course,
the Library of Congress

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:19.980 position:56%
and the magnificent Thomas Jefferson
Building, to what they have now,

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:24.720 position:59%
which are little teeny weeny libraries
that if you walk in a neighborhood,

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:30.160 position:63%
a lot of times you can see these little,
you know, birdhouse almost libraries.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.670
Where people just go and
put books that they've read,

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:36.830
and then you can take them and
add books that you've read.

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:39.380
So it's so fun.

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:44.360 position:69%
But also, the other thing about libraries
that I love, and remember I've seen them all

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:49.830 position:66%
over the United States, is that oftentimes
it's where people go to get on computers.

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:54.600
It's more than just books
now, which is wonderful.

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:58.380
It's a community gathering spot.

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:05.900 position:67%
And I've seen, you know, buildings, old
store buildings that have become libraries.

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:11.940
I've seen how towns have
adjusted their, you know,

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.290 position:67%
their downtowns to what fits the community.

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:17.510 position:64%
And of course, everybody loves a library.

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:18.890
Everybody does.

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:29.630 position:70%
&gt;&gt; Carol, we're going to talk next about what
you've been doing, not just since the days

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:33.920
of Willard and individual buildings
at the Library of Congress.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.970
Oh this is a great picture.

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:38.840 position:66%
So everyone, that's Carol Highsmith today,

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:43.280
ready for her 50th high school
reunion, believe it or not.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:48.490 position:61%
And California was certainly one of
the states Carol traversed many months,

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:52.180 position:64%
up and down coast, interior and the west.

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:55.920
Carol, I'll go ahead and start
the slides in this section.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:02.940 position:70%
And the kinds of things I wondered about is
how do you decide which scenes to photograph?

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.350 position:75%
Because there are millions of choices of course.

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:09.640 position:69%
And then what kinds of things you've learned
from the experience or even just tell us,

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:13.620
what's it like, life on the road.

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.150
&gt;&gt; Well, I love life on the road.

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:16.510
I think I'm a Nomad.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:22.280 position:75%
I think it's because all my young life we used
to travel down to see my grandmother and granny,

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.720 position:63%
down in North Carolina from Minneapolis.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:28.900
And so I just, you know,
I learned to love America.

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.640
It's gorgeous.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.880
I mean look at this wooden barn.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.450
Look at these cattle.

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:35.840 position:58%
You know, things are going to change.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.930
Wooden barns could be gone someday.

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:44.310 position:73%
What do I decide, and you know, what's so great
is I haven't really been given much dictate.

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:46.590 position:58%
So it's kind of like, just go for it.

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:51.020
So, but my problem is I have
trouble curbing myself.

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:54.770
If I go into a state, I really
want to get everything.

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:57.960
If I'm in Pennsylvania, I want
to show the Amish community.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.770
I want to show the farmers.

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:05.530
But I also want to do the big city
neighborhoods, the vegetable man.

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:07.400
And I can't stop.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.750
I don't know how to stop.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:10.610 position:58%
I want to show the different seasons.

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:15.630
I want to, if we race, we
race as fast as we can.

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:17.910
We work 13 hour days.

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:22.270 position:58%
And then when it rains, we'll stay
inside to make sure we have metadata.

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:25.620
My husband goes with me on the
road, so that really is helpful.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:29.430
And he writes the metadata,
and I take the images.

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:32.490 position:61%
But it's, everything is so fascinating.

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:34.160
I mean, look at New Orleans.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.050
I can't stop.

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:37.540
I need to go out every day.

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:39.790
And if you go into the French
Quarter in New Orleans,

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:44.290
you're always going to be
entertained and surprised.

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:48.240
And it's so much fun because
I'm now working with equipment

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.220 position:56%
that can handle just about anything.

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:52.550
It can handle low light.

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:59.630 position:64%
It can handle, I can leave my camera open
for an hour and catch the stars at night.

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:05.040
Look at Route 66 in America,
or just a big football game.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:09.440 position:64%
Or, you know, it's a never ending thrill.

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:14.160 position:56%
This is taken, this image was taken
when I studied the state of Alabama.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:21.470 position:69%
That was the first day that I really went
into and studied very, very, very seriously.

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:24.720
This man knew Martin Luther King.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.280
There he is a barber.

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.310 position:58%
He knew Martin Luther King very well.

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:31.480 position:56%
Wow. I couldn't stop talking to him.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:35.760
Of course, I've been to the
cherry blossoms a million times.

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:36.920
I can never get enough.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:42.070 position:64%
I always have to run down there if I'm
in town during the cherry blossom season.

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:46.730 position:70%
This is infrared camera, believe it or not,
a black and white infrared camera that I use.

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:49.420
It kind of makes everything dreamy.

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:52.930
But I like to shoot in black
in white sometimes just

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:57.400
because it's something different,
and it's kind of artistic.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:04.320
I try to not do too much art
because my task is to show America.

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:10.890 position:66%
And to show it clean and clear so that 100
years from now, or a 1,000 years from now,

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:17.870 position:73%
when digital is maybe gone, or certainly a lot
of the cell phone images we're taking are gone.

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:19.180
We can see America.

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:20.950
What America looked like.

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:26.160 position:70%
This is, believe it or not, a replication of
an image that Francis Benjamin Johnston took.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.530
I took this.

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:29.650
She was there also.

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:34.590 position:61%
So I had to go right back to the scene.

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:39.120
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Carol.

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:43.780 position:59%
I think we'll all be grabbing our
cameras and wanting to be on the road.

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:50.500 position:64%
The next section of, I've picked on
everyone's, the education outreach folks.

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:55.010 position:72%
They helped us choose one state to hone in on.

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:59.390
We've had a taste of Alabama,
the man who knew Martin Luther.

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:02.070 position:61%
Of course football for the Crimson Red.

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:09.830 position:72%
But let's start in a little deeper, Carol, and
talk a bit more about not just how you come

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:19.200 position:75%
up with an individual photo but how you're
thinking through this whole scheme of 50 states.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:27.490 position:73%
&gt;&gt; Well my scheme is, first of all, I want to
absolutely during my lifetime do all 50 states.

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:29.000
No question on it.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.060 position:56%
But, you know, when I'm in a state,
all I can think about is that state.

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:34.580
What is important here?

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:40.160 position:66%
It's the nuances, along with the
historic images, along with the big scene.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.490
So this is Alabama.

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:46.830
As I'm traveling, let's say
I want to do Birmingham,

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:50.750
and then I go to a smaller
scene, something like this.

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:54.320 position:66%
I will oftentimes catch things on the way.

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:58.100
So I keep my eyes peeled
for everything, anything.

00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:00.590
Animals are important.

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:02.280
Foliage is important.

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:08.310 position:59%
All of our historic properties are
highly important, so I look for those.

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:10.440
This is an old Civil War scene.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:16.440
It was the last Civil War
battle, the last one period.

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:19.410
They didn't get the word,
and they were still fighting.

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:21.220
The Civil War was over.

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:23.500
So it's a gravesite.

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.990
This is the Selma.

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:29.440
I went to the march.

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:33.600
So I look for important events
that have happened in the states.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.990
I'm interested in teeny tiny towns.

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:38.510 position:64%
I'm interested in big city neighborhoods.

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:40.840
I'm interested in landscapes.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.740 position:75%
Obviously in Alabama the Civil War was very big.

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:45.940
This was a reenactment.

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:52.030
So I just open my mind to
what is that state all about?

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:58.440 position:66%
And the beautiful race cars at Tuscaloosa.

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:05.880 position:64%
How important, I'm sorry, not Tuscaloosa,
but how important the various events are.

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.630
That's incredible.

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:13.560
&gt;&gt; From my notes, Carol, it says
Talladega, so that may be the word.

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.380
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean Talladega.

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:16.570
Yeah that's the [inaudible] word.

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:19.780 position:58%
&gt;&gt; It's at Talladega, super-speedway.

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:20.000
Supposing.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:20.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:22.810 position:58%
&gt;&gt; Supposing that the teachers wanted

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:27.490 position:67%
to have their students do a little
community preservation through photography,

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:30.550
I'll keep rolling through
some more scenes from Alabama.

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:34.810
But what advice might you give them
if they wanted to become creators

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:38.090 position:58%
of primary source research documents?

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:41.670 position:75%
&gt;&gt; Okay, so maybe you want to follow my mindset.

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:44.520 position:69%
And that is, how are things going to change?

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:49.470
Will football still be around,
let's say, during your lifetime?

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:52.700
If you have a 13-year old
student, and you say to him,

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.510 position:69%
well let's go out and shoot a football game.

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:57.490 position:75%
You know, it's been around for a very long time.

00:25:57.490 --> 00:25:59.110
Now it's changed some.

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:03.460 position:73%
But will it be around when you're 90 years old?

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:07.130
And what is it that's fascinating
about football?

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:09.420
Or theater?

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:10.840
What's fascinating about it?

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.610
How has it changed?

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:14.390
How will it change?

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:19.550
So everything will become
historic during your lifetime.

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:25.040 position:72%
Just a little class of what do they look like?

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:28.140
You know, I remember these look
like they might be girl scouts,

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.240 position:61%
and I remember when I was a girl scout.

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:36.700 position:61%
So I think I would say to students, why
don't you just put on your thinking cap

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:43.460
and see what you can capture
that you think might change.

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:47.730 position:61%
And then we'll talk about it, you know.

00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:52.110
I photograph everything because
I think everything will change.

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:53.560
Because it did.

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:57.610
IT changed from Francis Benjamin
Johnston's time.

00:26:57.610 --> 00:27:00.140 position:72%
But I think students need to think about that.

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:04.520 position:58%
That they're in the here and now,
and maybe they're not thinking about.

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:08.270 position:61%
They're probably thinking the cellphone
images they take, for instance,

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:10.730
the selfies, will always be there.

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:12.530
Will they?

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:16.160
So maybe they need to think
about, and then to maybe think

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.740 position:72%
about their small towns or wherever they live.

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:23.680 position:61%
What might disappear even in ten years?

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.270
Or fifteen years?

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:28.970 position:72%
This Hillcrest Motel, probably is gone by now.

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:42.850 position:58%
And then sometimes just photographing
things that might be important

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:45.710
to them and why they're important.

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:48.540
Why is a city scape important?

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:54.090 position:64%
Why is it important, have the water, have
the city scape reflect into the water?

00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:58.430 position:59%
Water, will that be forever available?

00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:03.700 position:58%
I mean look at California and some of
the difficulties it's had, and Texas.

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:07.290
Well, it's always fun to
do any kind of carnival.

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:09.080
I love carnivals.

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:11.220
And I think kids would too.

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:19.200
And to, you know, to do creative
things, do photography at night.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:23.400
And now, of course, cellphones
can capture almost anything.

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:30.200
So I think kids would, I would just
advise them to see things, see,

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:36.200 position:70%
look around their communities and take
images of everything, just for interest sake.

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:42.780
Things they're interested in
or maybe not interested in.

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:45.760 position:67%
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Carol, those are real good tips.

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:50.470
We're going to take a shift
now a little bit and think

00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:53.950 position:70%
about one aspect of what you already covered.

00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:58.160 position:59%
The phrase is often vanishing America.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:05.140 position:75%
So photography as primary source documents can
be really important for seeing change over time.

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:06.890
You spoke about that.

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:13.540 position:67%
But then there's also the challenge of some
things are going to completely disappear.

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:23.930 position:75%
And how do you go about, the word capture is in
my mind, but your photographs are special to me,

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:29.220 position:56%
Carol, because you managed to get an
entire story within a single frame.

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:36.890 position:72%
What you said about documentary value, as much
as artistic composition, clarity of color.

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:41.310
And so, again, back to that,
there are millions of choices

00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:44.060 position:59%
about what you could be photographing.

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:49.920 position:66%
The thing in this section here will be the
vanishing America and what it means to you

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:54.380 position:56%
that it will be your photograph that
is all that is left of say a barn,

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:58.650 position:75%
like a Mail Pouch, with a Mail Pouch tobacco ad.

00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:04.190 position:59%
&gt;&gt; You know, when I take a photograph,
I am clueless as to what I'm taking,

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:09.040
whether or not what I'm taking
will be here a year from now.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:13.150 position:63%
Unfortunately, I've seen things
disappear that didn't, I didn't want to,

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:17.010
and that was I took photographs
of the World Trade Center

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:20.800 position:70%
from the air, and a month later, it was gone.

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:24.350 position:63%
But I use the word disappearing America.

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:28.650 position:67%
I've done a great deal of time on Route 66.

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:35.420 position:61%
I photographed a lot of old motels and
two-lane highways and old gas stations.

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:37.800
I did a pure station the other day.

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:42.740
This is, believe it or not,
a scene from Katrina.

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:48.340
It wiped out the Waffle House
and left four seats.

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:52.600 position:56%
But it is really not for me to know.

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:58.390 position:63%
I am interested in everything, but as
I'm traveling through the United States,

00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:02.820 position:75%
there's a lot of kind of, you know, small towns.

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:05.280 position:58%
Some of them are not doing that well.

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.830
Some are doing very well.

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:11.710 position:63%
But, you know, barns, old railroad cars.

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:17.400
Old cars. They're just fascinating.

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:20.490 position:69%
And you know, I can't travel across America.

00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:23.120
Oh and by the way, I don't fly.

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.570
We only drive.

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:25.740
That's all we ever do.

00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:26.790
This is Big Tex.

00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:27.870
Guess what.

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:35.690 position:63%
This image, I took, and two weeks later,
it had been standing for 60 years.

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:39.030 position:56%
Two weeks later it burnt to a crisp.

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:40.080
Burnt down.

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.970
So there we go.

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:43.570
There we go again.

00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:45.970
I took an image, and it's gone.

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:50.010 position:56%
So how wonderful that at least it
exists, and the Library of Congress,

00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:52.910 position:70%
there's nothing like the Library of Congress.

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:57.900
They, the Library of Congress
is all about preservation.

00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:59.520
That's what it stands for.

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:01.250
And that's what I stand for.

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:06.090 position:59%
And there's no better place to have my
images than the Library of Congress.

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:08.010 position:59%
But, you know, look at this old place.

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:10.120
Look at phones.

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:13.890
You know, I see them every once in
a while, I still see pay phones.

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:15.750
And I take photos of them.

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:17.560
Because they're just about gone.

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:21.530
So technology is changing our life.

00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:23.520
Old lighthouses.

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:27.020 position:69%
We have about 900 left in the United States.

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:30.960 position:72%
So, I am, I consider myself a preservationist.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.210
I am taking historic properties.

00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:39.220 position:69%
I'm taking photographs of cities, states,
regions, tiny towns, whatever, I don't care.

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:41.220
Everything's America.

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:47.400 position:72%
But I have great satisfaction in the fact that
they're going to be preserved in a place that,

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:53.790 position:63%
there's no better place than the Library
of Congress to have them preserved.

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:57.970
Because that's what the Library of
Congress stands for, preservation.

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:02.160
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much, Carol.

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:07.510 position:66%
Having had a good look at buildings,
whether it's Big Tex standing for 60 years

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:11.010 position:61%
and all of a sudden, catastrophic fire.

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:13.420
He's disappeared.

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:20.440 position:75%
Or the gradual of operation of pay phones from
our, [inaudible] our new technology comes about.

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.940
The pictures are rich.

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:27.020
Lots of detail to look at and think
about and reflect on with students.

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:32.800 position:75%
But as interesting as the built environment is,
we're going to turn now to the wonderful people,

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:36.770 position:56%
the heart of communities, and the
photographs you've made in that way.

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:41.130
Tell us something about each
of these pictures please.

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:42.570
&gt;&gt; Well, this was in New Orleans.

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:45.650
I just happened by these women,
and they were having so much fun.

00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:48.270
So I had fun with them.

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:51.060 position:72%
And I just photographed them and their babies.

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:53.390
We just had a ball.

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:55.190
I said guess what.

00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:59.440 position:58%
I said when your babies are 90 years
old, they can look at this photograph

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:06.060 position:69%
and see what they looked like when they were
babies on the Library of Congress website.

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:14.330
Oh and little of, you know, county
fairs and animals and young people.

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:19.050
And everybody, families, and
people just having a good time.

00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:21.840 position:61%
Oh man, America is just filled with it.

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:26.530
And look at this little lemonade
stand, you know.

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:28.750
Francis, I wish you would
have been with me that day.

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:31.240
I think she would have loved it.

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:36.840 position:59%
And this was a place where they make
quilts, believe it or not, in Alabama.

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.900
And her children were helping
her make this quilt.

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:43.720
And oh, it just meant a great
deal for me to be with them.

00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:48.380 position:56%
And just somebody just doing a
little skateboarding, and, you know,

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:53.230
murals are all over America,
in every town just about.

00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:55.470 position:73%
And so it's just fun to kind of capture people.

00:34:55.470 --> 00:34:57.710
And look at these reenactors.

00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:03.470
This was right outside, right next
to the White House, is Lincoln,

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:05.870 position:56%
Jefferson and Washington reenactors.

00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:08.600
The kids must have loved it.

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.340 position:66%
And this is a little scene in New Orleans.

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:12.480
I've spent a lot of time
in New Orleans, by the way,

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:16.310
because Francis Benjamin Johnston
lived there, and I love it so much.

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:23.940
This is a little jazz band in one
of the places on Bourbon Street.

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:27.870
And this is an ice cream vendor.

00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:30.370
Snow cones they call them.

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:31.560
And just kids.

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:36.970
And this is a little scene I
caught in Texas, believe it not.

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:39.490 position:69%
This man was a veteran, and he was homeless.

00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:42.620 position:64%
And he was with his daughter and his dog.

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:48.140 position:72%
And I treated them to a little meal afterwards
because they were so wonderful for me.

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:52.030
And they let me, they posed for
me for about a half an hour.

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:53.870
And it just meant the world to me.

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:59.200
And this is a football game, yay.

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.590 position:73%
I think this might have been Alabama or Auburn.

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:03.230
I don't know.

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:04.480
I just loved it.

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:11.720
And this is chess players in
New York City believe it or not.

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:12.870
I mean look at America.

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:14.320
Look how rich it is.

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:14.850
Look how fun.

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:15.950
&gt;&gt; So Carol.

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:17.090
&gt;&gt; Yes mam.

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:22.120
&gt;&gt; I was going to say let's go
ahead and take 30 seconds and look

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:24.310 position:69%
at that picture, but it's disappeared on us.

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:26.290
So we'll pick the next one.

00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:27.530
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:31.490
&gt;&gt; Back to that idea that
photos are rich in information,

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:35.430
multi-purpose can be used
all kinds of different ways.

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:40.620
Our final section.

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:44.650
Yeah our section focuses
on the natural landscape.

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:47.550 position:69%
The people pictures were great and glorious.

00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:54.130 position:61%
You often say, Carol, it's our choice
to focus on a brighter side of America.

00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:57.340 position:56%
You're showing the homeless veteran,

00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:01.220
young children who knows how
their lives will turn out.

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:04.550 position:72%
The destruction of Katrina and September 11th.

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:09.770
And yet, photographs almost
always have a purpose and a point.

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:15.560 position:66%
And yours is to make sure that people see
an optimistic or positive side of America.

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:20.500 position:64%
So as we look at these photographs that
sometimes have me ready to sing the song,

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:26.320 position:70%
Oh Beautiful for Spacious Skies, if you could
talk just a little bit about how you came

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:30.740 position:58%
to your philosophy of photography and
how that is such an important part

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:34.150 position:58%
of understanding the primary sources.

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:37.000
&gt;&gt; Well, you know, America is vast.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:43.410
And you really get that when
you stand in a national park.

00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:49.100 position:58%
We're about to celebrate our national
parks next year, our centennial year.

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:51.940
And, you know, it's just gorgeous.

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:55.780
Now this is a windmill way
out in the middle of nowhere.

00:37:55.780 --> 00:38:04.080 position:56%
But just, you know, you look across
our land, and it's just magnificent.

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:05.840
It's huge.

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:14.160 position:70%
And I think everybody even from overseas
gets that, that America is an enormous place.

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:20.690 position:63%
You know, I just came from Wyoming where
you just, the landscape is just forever.

00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:28.490 position:66%
You can look across it, and there seems to
be just no ending to what you're seeing.

00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:30.400
This is just a sand dune.

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:31.980
We have many sand dunes.

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:33.940
We have sand dunes in Wyoming.

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:35.270
We have them in Colorado.

00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:37.210
We have them in many states.

00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:38.780
This is the California coast.

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:41.500
Now that's another place where
you can look out over the ocean.

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:46.210 position:67%
And it seems like you can just see forever.

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:50.900
It's all-inspiring is what it is.

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:53.190
And how lucky we are.

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:55.160
These are our redwoods.

00:38:55.160 --> 00:39:00.380 position:66%
I didn't know what to do when I got to the
redwoods because you can't capture them

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:05.310
in one photograph, no matter
how tall your camera is.

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:07.310
Because they're huge.

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:11.710 position:59%
This is just a little scene in Hawaii.

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:16.650 position:69%
Just a little, you know, near a lake almost.

00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:19.960
Everywhere you go, it's scenic.

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:24.680 position:61%
Even in small towns, believe it or not.

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:32.030 position:73%
We have all of our, certainly on the east
coast, and in the Midwest, we have our seasons.

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:36.310 position:58%
So that is a whole other scenic view.

00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:42.770 position:67%
This is very near my house in Washington
D.C. And then you go to the time of tulips.

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:47.100
Well tulips last maybe a
week or two, and that's it.

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:49.460
So you run around to get
them everywhere you can.

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:54.060 position:67%
Our botanical gardens are just magnificent.

00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:57.190 position:56%
And then we have all the structures.

00:39:57.190 --> 00:40:02.610
This is in Arizona, Utah.

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:09.220
They're called slot canyons because
little slots of sun come through.

00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:10.830
They're gorgeous.

00:40:10.830 --> 00:40:15.130
They're absolutely magnificent.

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:17.250
[ Inaudible ]

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:18.060
Yes, I'm sorry.

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:19.560
&gt;&gt; No that's alright, Carol.

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:26.460 position:64%
I thought you had the perfect tagline for
bringing our slideshow to a conclusion.

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:28.220
Magnificent America.

00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:34.740 position:64%
We're going to take the rest of the time
to hear some questions from the teachers,

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:42.030
and we'll try to convey them
to you as clearly as we can.

00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:44.780
&gt;&gt; Hi, this is Cheryl from
the Library of Congress.

00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:48.700
I've been collecting questions
as they've shown up in the chat.

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:52.370
And if you haven't put a question
in the chat, go ahead and do that,

00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:54.590
and we'll get to as many as we can.

00:40:54.590 --> 00:41:01.360 position:66%
One of the questions that you had that I
saw was about digital and around the phase

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:04.070 position:61%
that Carols said when digital was gone.

00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:11.540 position:75%
And one of the participants was wondering if she
expects that our digital images will disappear.

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:13.570
&gt;&gt; Well, you know, that's
an interesting question.

00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:17.050 position:66%
I don't know, and it's not for me to know.

00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:22.610
But isn't it fascinating to
you that film is almost gone?

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:28.460
So does that say to you that maybe
it might be 500 years from now,

00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:32.830
that maybe digital will maybe
not be gone but may change.

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:38.550 position:67%
That listen, during my lifetime, there have
been many things that have come and gone.

00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:45.160
Cassettes, video used to
be on huge two inch tapes.

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:48.140 position:69%
Super eight movies that my dad used to take.

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:52.950 position:58%
So things are changing, have changed,
have changed greatly in my lifetime.

00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:54.910
So I don't know.

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:59.340
And I'm not one to know, and I
don't think anybody really knows.

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:00.640
But they may.

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:02.420
Things may change.

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:04.910
&gt;&gt; Thanks Carol.

00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:08.090 position:66%
Somewhat related question was a follow up.

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:12.490 position:63%
You mentioned that your husband collects
metadata, and somebody was interested,

00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:17.970 position:58%
a couple of people were interested
in what kind of metadata he collects.

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:23.580 position:61%
&gt;&gt; Well what I meant by that is there's
no way that I can give Helena an image

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:25.210
that doesn't have metadata on it.

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:31.390 position:73%
If I take an image, and I just submit it to
the Library of Congress without anything on it,

00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:36.430 position:70%
how will you who, hopefully, are going to use
this collection, have any clue what it is.

00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:44.070
So every image I take has
GPS on it and has metadata

00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:49.150 position:66%
so that we can convey to you what this is.

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:50.970
What is this scene?

00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:56.700
&gt;&gt; Terrific.

00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:59.460
Let me process.

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:04.480 position:69%
&gt;&gt; Cheryl, I'll jump in just to add, in
terms of preserving the digital photographs,

00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:10.690 position:69%
the Library of Congress is very fortunate to
have skillful staff who are deeply committed

00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:16.090 position:59%
to migrating these digital images from
one type of storage media to another.

00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:21.970 position:75%
So we'll be working hard to preserve them longer
than the contents of the scene will ever survive

00:43:21.970 --> 00:43:26.230 position:58%
in the same way we've done a great
job with preserving film photography.

00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:28.300 position:66%
And on that metadata front, Carol's right.

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:30.070
I'm pretty fierce about it.

00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:36.180 position:73%
But we like to have a title, the date the photo
was taken, the place where she was standing.

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:40.750
If things go well, we'll also have
latitude-longitude, so geospatial,

00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:43.380 position:58%
very precise recording in the future.

00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:48.110
Carol is a master of keeping up
with the latest of new technology.

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:54.890 position:56%
And so, while we have a basic idea
of content, subject, when and where,

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:58.840
we're also open to adapting if
she can bring in more metadata

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:00.740 position:58%
and information into each photograph.

00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:01.940
Thank you.

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:12.070 position:67%
&gt;&gt; Yes. And let me just say one more thing
to that, and that is that, that is correct.

00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:16.270
That is the reason that I had to
go to the Library of Congress.

00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:20.390 position:67%
There's no better place because of the fact

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:24.230
that that's what the Library
of Congress is all about.

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:26.970 position:56%
Being able to preserve our heritage.

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:35.130
&gt;&gt; Fantastic.

00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:39.070
The next question coming
in is about your process.

00:44:39.070 --> 00:44:43.020
Again, how do you decide what angle
to capture and what story to tell?

00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:44.540
I guess that's two questions.

00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:47.480
So tackle that how you like, Carol.

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:53.390
&gt;&gt; Well I'm always looking for the
sun on my back so that if I'm out,

00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:55.900 position:59%
I want that sun behind me if possible.

00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:59.480 position:61%
Because I want the scene very well lit.

00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:01.830 position:75%
The other thing is, you know, after you've done.

00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:04.770
I mean I'm 35 years on this.

00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:10.510 position:66%
So after a while you really kind of become
almost second nature at capturing things.

00:45:10.510 --> 00:45:15.200
Because this is what I do, and
I do it every day, all day.

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.280
I mean every weekend, always.

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:18.110
I love it.

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:20.160
I can't say that enough.

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:25.510 position:72%
And so therefore, after a while, you just kind
of, it becomes very, very, very second nature.

00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:33.270 position:69%
But well-lit is important, so that
everyone can see the scene and understand it

00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:36.970
and see how beautiful it is or not.

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:53.470 position:66%
&gt;&gt; Carol, what state will you tackle next?

00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:57.470 position:75%
I think I saw a question go by wondering if you
were coming towards New Hampshire any time soon.

00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:58.790 position:63%
&gt;&gt; You know, I've been to New Hampshire.

00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:03.600 position:56%
I actually had a book on the Mount
Washington Hotel, believe it or not.

00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:08.010
And yes, I did capture old man
in the mountain, before it fell.

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:10.100 position:64%
That's the other thing is that, you know,

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:12.700
even our natural landscapes
sometimes can have disasters.

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:15.420
But I don't think I'm up in
New England any time real soon.

00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:19.420
But I certainly have it on my
radar screen, that's for sure.

00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:22.920
&gt;&gt; Then tell us a little about the
states you're traveling in today.

00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:29.220
Because I know we got a great
bunch of photos from you recently.

00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:32.830
&gt;&gt; I just spent about four
and a half months on the road.

00:46:32.830 --> 00:46:35.050
I was in Wyoming.

00:46:35.050 --> 00:46:36.860
Beautiful Wyoming.

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:38.230
Wild Wyoming.

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:42.860 position:58%
Gorgeous Wyoming with Yellowstone and
the Teton, and all that it offers.

00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:51.050 position:63%
And then Colorado and its, the mountains
and the, again, it's breathtaking.

00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:55.010 position:69%
That's why I have to kind of catch my breath
talking about either one of those states.

00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:58.550
And then I just spent about
two weeks in West Virginia,

00:46:58.550 --> 00:47:01.720
trying my very best to get
into a working coal mine.

00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:06.290 position:66%
It looks like I'm going to get in, but it
might be a few weeks before I can do that.

00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:13.710 position:75%
But so, and of course, you know, traveling back
and forth through these states, to these states.

00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:15.120
So I go through the Midwest.

00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:19.070
I'm going to be working some
in the Midwest next year.

00:47:19.070 --> 00:47:22.550 position:58%
So I have a very full year next year.

00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:27.730 position:61%
I think I'll be in most of the American
states next year, believe it or not.

00:47:27.730 --> 00:47:30.240 position:69%
Well I just, I'm going to go back to Wyoming

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:33.820
and Colorado during the winter
months and the spring months.

00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:39.750 position:63%
&gt;&gt; Carol, to wrap up, it looks, I think
Cheryl may have just two more questions.

00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:41.700
Do you ever miss working with film?

00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:50.790 position:67%
&gt;&gt; No, you know, I'm so, well first of all,
I'm working with camera equipment that's

00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:58.190 position:69%
so iconic I can hardly deal with it when I
look at it on my computer, it's magnificent.

00:47:58.190 --> 00:48:01.060
So no, I really don't.

00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:04.580
So what I'm capturing is
what we call born digital.

00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:09.060
And that is that if I worked in
film I would have to come back,

00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:13.200 position:64%
scan it, get the dust off, which is huge.

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.970 position:58%
And then do the metadata and the
color correcting and everything else.

00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:18.390 position:58%
Now I come back and it's ready to go.

00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:21.400 position:70%
Now, I still have to do some color correction

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:25.870
and some adjustments, but
it is so much easier for me.

00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:30.190 position:70%
And also, it is a four by five piece of film.

00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:37.490 position:59%
The cameras that are working, that I'm
working in now are five times the size

00:48:37.490 --> 00:48:40.610 position:63%
of a scanned four by five piece of film.

00:48:40.610 --> 00:48:47.450
So, you know, how can I, it's
just fantastic where I am headed.

00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:52.750 position:64%
Now, it's a lot of money, but it is worth
for the Library of Congress collection.

00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:58.360
It is worth having fine equipment
so that you all can use it.

00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:01.220
And by the way, what's so
wonderful about the Library

00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:06.060
of Congress is they put these
images on in various sizes.

00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:09.600
So if you just want a small
size, you can have one.

00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:11.890
It's fantastic.

00:49:11.890 --> 00:49:13.960
&gt;&gt; Carol, we're out of time.

00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:20.970 position:64%
It's 4:50, and I think you may have found
the perfect ending, the word fantastic.

00:49:20.970 --> 00:49:23.040 position:67%
I've really enjoyed talking with you today.

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:28.040 position:67%
Even though we've had many conversations
before, I always learn new things from you.

00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:32.470
I will keep that phrase, the
sun at my back, closely in mind.

00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:37.030 position:59%
And it's been great for all of you who
participated, watching your questions

00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:39.630 position:67%
and comments and observations come through.

00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:43.500 position:61%
Thank you for being so engaged with us.

00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:48.240
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Helena, and thank
you, Carol, for joining us.

00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:52.950 position:56%
This was a fascinating discussion,
and I can't thank you enough for all

00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:55.730
of your time, energy and efforts.

00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:58.410
And sharing your resources with us.

00:49:58.410 --> 00:50:02.560 position:75%
A couple of housekeeping items for our audience.

00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:05.370 position:72%
You can take, we'd love to hear your feedback.

00:50:05.370 --> 00:50:07.570
There is a link to a survey monkey.

00:50:07.570 --> 00:50:11.440 position:61%
Please make sure that you click
through that and give us some feedback.

00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:12.660
It's three questions.

00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:15.800 position:70%
Shouldn't take you more than a minute or two.

00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:20.060
You will receive information
within the next five business days

00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:23.600
about receiving your certificates
for one instructional hour

00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:25.470
after completion of this session.

00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:30.440
And that goes for the folks who
are listening to the recording too.

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:34.720 position:70%
We are recording all the sessions for our
online conference, and they will be available

00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:40.230 position:58%
through the teacher's page at
loc.gov/teachers, starting next week.

00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:44.930
And we will send you an update as
to when everything gets updated.

00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:46.650
And continue the conversation.

00:50:46.650 --> 00:50:49.280
Lots of great ideas were
shared in the chat today.

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:54.050
So please, feel free to keep the
conversation going via Twitter.

00:50:54.050 --> 00:51:00.140
Our handle is at TeachingLC,
and the hashtag is LCTeachConf.

00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:05.440 position:56%
So again, I can't say thank you
enough to Carol Highsmith and Helena

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:10.580
for the great conversation today.

00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:14.450
