00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.480
Get your bucket of water balloons ready, because
we're gonna need them. In this project

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.160
we're converting our rocket rifle into a high
power water balloon launcher.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.530
For this project, I stopped by the dollar
store and picked up a pack of 100 water balloons

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.739
for a buck. These are the small ones, and
we only need to fill them up to about a 2"

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.539
diameter. We'll also need to use these pre-made
cannon wads that we formed in the "Candy Cannon"

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.940
project. These wads are made out of cheap plastic cups prevent the water balloons from bursting during the

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:52.229
launch. If you don't have plastic cups, I
found that 2" water balls can work pretty

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:55.280
well as a substitute. Ok, to make a water
balloon cannon let's grab our rocket launcher,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.960
and unscrew the barrel, because this will
act as our ramrod. With the rocket barrel

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.780
removed, it's time to attach the "cannon adaptor".
This is made with a 2' length of 2" PVC pipe,

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.210
and some reducer fittings. The plastic wad
goes in, and gets pushed all the way to the

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.590
bottom, then we can add a little water, or
vegetable oil, for lubrication just prior

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.079
to inserting a purple water balloon. Alright,
it's ready for a test, so I'll hook up my

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:24.590
air hose, and set the compressor to 65 PSI.
Holding the launcher at about a 45 degree

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.149
angle, let's get ready to fire. You'll probably
notice the plastic wads falling away to the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:33.829
side, and the balloon is really out there.
So far, in-fact, that nobody can keep it in

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:39.109
sight. It easily clears the white fence over
300 feet away. Well I'm pretty happy about

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:43.340
that, so let's see what else it can do. One of my little boys is gonna try out 3 balloons

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.049
at once, and with the help of a friend, it's
a great shot. Let's try this out with the

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:53.859
Candy Cannon! It's already got a 2" barrel
so no modifications are necessary. Just lock,

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:58.960
and load. The air hose is attached, and the
valve opened so it's ready to go. All it takes

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.649
now is a press of the detonator button, and
we've got a gorgeous array of liquid projectiles!

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.789
If you're loading a balloon that's a little
too big, just give the barrel a little shake,

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.350
and it should slide on down. If you want to
go portable, just close the manual valve and

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.680
disconnect the air hose. Your system is still
charged and ready to fire. These balloon blasters

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.000
are intense. If you want a real challenge,
try shooting the balloons straight up and

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.740
catching them on the way back down. This is working great, so let's go bigger.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.440
I've just loaded 13 water balloons to see what happens. Aaah, that was a little weak. Let's bump the pressure

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.330
up to about 90 PSI and see if that makes a
difference. Yeah, that's working much better.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.560
So for multiple balloons we just need higher
pressure, and look at this, now we've got

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.140
ourselves a water balloon shotgun! I'm gonna push the envelope just a little and fill

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.739
this barrel all the way to the top. I counted
17 water balloons in there, and rather than

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.730
just shoot them, I'm gonna target my neighbors house! Hopefully they'll understand this is

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.980
friendly fire. But to even things up, I'd
better hit my own house as well. So there

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.780
you go! That's how to modify your Rocket Launcher
and Candy Cannon into high power water balloon

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.060
launchers. If you liked this project, perhaps
you'll like some of my others. Check them
