00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.280
&gt;&gt; Announcer: From the Library
of Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.510
&gt;&gt; Marisa: Please join me in
welcoming Kathleen Glasgow.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:16.650
[ Applause ]

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.640
&gt;&gt; Kathleen: Thank you so much
for coming to see me today,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.470
and I'd like to thank the National
Book Festival and the Library

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.350
of Congress for putting on this
great event and inviting me.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.050
I want to also thank
the city of Washington,

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.900
DC because without Washington,
DC, I literally would not exist.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.580
My parents met when
they were at Georgetown.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.420
So that's my tie to the city.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.770
I used to visit here a lot.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.730
I grew up in Pennsylvania, and we
used to come up a lot in the 70s

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.490
and go see some of their
old college friends and go

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.500
to what they called rent parties.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.220
Does anybody know what
a rent party is or was?

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.870
And it's when you can't pay your
rent, so you throw a big party

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.560
and your friends all come and they
give you like a couple of bucks

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.910
at the door towards your
rent, and my siblings

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.130
and I probably should not have
been going to those parties,

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.580
but it was the 70s and I remember
it as being like a lot of fun,

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.150
and maybe that's partly
what made me a writer.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.350
A lot of people ask me how I
came to write "Girl in Pieces,"

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.360
which is the story of Charlie
Davis who uses self-harm to cope

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.930
with her intense emotional trauma.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.000
Does everybody here
know what self-harm is?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.550
I'm not going to explain it to
you because I don't know who's

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.260
in the audience, but it is
the act of hurting yourself

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.780
to release emotional pain,
and I often tell people

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.590
that I gave Charlie my scars, but
I gave her her own story, too,

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.990 position:56%
and the story in this book takes her
from Minnesota to Tucson, Arizona,

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.290
where she learns how to
take care of herself.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.920 position:56%
She's homeless when the book begins.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.680
She's briefly in a hospital.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.050 position:56%
She's kicked out because she doesn't
have insurance, and then she's put

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.840
on the bus by her mother
to go to Tucson to stay

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.560
with her old college friend, or
her old high school friend, Mikey,

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.950
and it's there that she falls
in with a group of people

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.760
at a coffee house that she
ends up working at and sort

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.420
of learns what kind of
life she wants to lead,

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.850
and the book is filled
with some very hard topics,

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.960
and as I've been traveling the
states this year talking to people

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.160
about the book, I've met a lot
of people who have read the book

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.200
and said, "You know, I don't know

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.720
if that really qualifies
as a young adult novel.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.250
There's addiction in the book.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.550
There's abuse.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.160
There's assault," and
they say, "You know,

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.670
I'm not sure I want my kids
reading that," and I respect that,

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:01.970 position:56%
but my answer to that is, "Don't you
remember high school and growing up

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.220
and how hard it could be?"

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.630 position:56%
And my answer to that is, "You know,

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.520
suicide is the number one
cause of death for teenagers.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.250
Why wouldn't you let them read a
book about it so they could learn

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.500
about it and process their
feelings if they had those thoughts

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.070
or if they knew somebody in their
school who had committed suicide?"

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:33.870
How can you tell a 15-year-old
girl who suffered assault

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.340
that she's old enough to go
through it but she's not old enough

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.140
to read a book about it so that
she can process her feelings?

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.200
Books like these need to be on the
shelf, and they need to be talked

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.180
about because kids who
suffer this stuff need a way

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.950
to process their feelings and
to heal, and they need to know

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.750
above all that they're not alone.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.540
So I say that I write this
story-I wrote this story for a girl

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.130
that I met on the bus when I was
leaving my job at the University

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:14.110
of Minnesota, and she had
fresh scars on her arm,

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.120
and I didn't say anything to her,

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.760
and I always think I
should have talked to her,

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.390
and I should have told her,
"I'm where-I used to be

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.220
where you are right now, and
you're not alone, and I understand,

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.680
and you can talk to me, and
there is hope," but I didn't.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.240
Instead I went home and I thought
about it, and I wrote a book

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.860 position:56%
to that girl, and ever since I wrote
this book, I get letters from kids.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:49.900
I got this letter from a girl named
Lily, and Lily said, "I'm Lily,

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:58.630
and I attend school in Illinois,
and in 2017 I will be 13 1/2 ,"

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.040
and Lily goes on to say, "In
the first grade I started

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.950
to notice the bullying
that was happening to me.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:13.680 position:56%
I got called 'heavy,' 'fat,' and I
felt stupid because it was horrible,

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:22.230 position:56%
and it made me feel dumb," and later
in the letter she tells me that

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:27.320
"Sixth grade was when the big black
depression cloud started to form,

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.930
and I have never come out of that,"
and the first time that Lily tried

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.300
to commit suicide, she
was in the first grade,

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.550
and she tried to drink hair
gel, and she says in the letter,

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.780
"I didn't know how to do it.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.080
It was gross.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.380
Don't try it.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.960
It tastes bad," and we might
think that's kind of funny,

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:52.020
but she was in the first
grade, and now she's 13 1/2.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.550
She doesn't have any other
book that talks to her

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.550
about how she feels except for this
book, and at the end of the letter,

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.950
she tells me she's on her
third hospitalization,

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.620
but her mom got her this book

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.530 position:56%
because she didn't have anywhere
else to turn, and her mom had no way

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.840
to talk to her about
what was going on,

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.200
and they read this book
together, and now they're

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.520
in counseling together, and
that's why difficult books

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.870
that might make you as
a parent or an educator

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.150
or a librarian feel a little big
uncomfortable, that's why books

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.830
like these actually matter to
kids because they want to talk

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.280
about that stuff that is
making them feel alone

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.720
and uncomfortable and marginalized.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:45.560
When I was younger, this is the
story of how I became a writer,

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.390
and it has to do with my
mother who went to Georgetown.

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:53.120
There were four other kids in my
family, and they were much older

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.200
than I was, and they
were all in school,

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.920
and my mother was rightfully tired
after doing all that mothering

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.560
and getting them off to school and
giving them cereal and whatnot,

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.370
and so as soon as they
left, she would, you know,

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.630
light up a cigarette, get on
the couch, and open up a book,

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.930
and she was a voracious reader,
and I realized very early on that

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.480
if I wanted my mother
to pay attention to me,

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.380
I was going to have
to learn to read.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.990 position:56%
So I taught myself to read when I
was three by watching Sesame Street,

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.990
which I'm still an advocate of.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.820
I love that show, and my mother
looked at me one day and said,

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:28.540
"Okay, it's on," and from
that day on, every day we went

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:32.550
down to the central public library
in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania,

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.110
and we spent hours there until my
brothers and sisters came home,

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:40.130
and she let me pick out whatever
book I wanted to pick out.

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:44.420
She didn't care if it was meant for
adults or if it was meant for kids.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:45.770
She just wanted me to read,

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.730 position:56%
and we talked about reading together
all the time, and I read things

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.150
that I probably shouldn't have
been reading, like maybe some books

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:54.970 position:56%
that were like a little too sexy for
a 10-year-old, but I like to think

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:59.450
that those, you know, gave
me an education as well.

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:02.980
When we moved to Tucson, my
mother took a job in an office,

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.430
and I was really lonely, and it
was a huge difference from being

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.820
in Pennsylvania, and I didn't
have any friends, and I was 11.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:14.380 position:56%
So it was right about that age where
things start to happen for you,

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:19.340
but every weekend, my mother, all
90 pounds and five feet of her,

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:25.700 position:56%
would lug home this giant IBM
Selectric typewriter from her office

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:29.080
and set it up on the
dresser in her bedroom

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.660
and let me write my
stories all weekend.

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:36.490
Every weekend she did that,
and then during the week,

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:38.590
she would let me read
them aloud to her,

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:42.220
and she would always
say, "That's great.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.670
I love that.

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:46.450
How did you come up with that?"

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:51.500
And if you can be that person for
a kid where you have no judgment,

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.840
where you let them be
who they want to be,

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.540
you can literally save their life.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.010
I would not have made it
through my adolescence

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:03.200
if I didn't have an
outlet like writing

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:08.230
and if I didn't have the support
that I had from my mother.

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:12.170 position:56%
So if you can be that person who
brings that IBM Selectric typewriter

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:16.710
to a kid in your life, I hope
that you decide to be that person

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:21.250
because it really matters, and if
you're an educator or a librarian

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:25.660 position:56%
who can put that book on a shelf for
a kid who maybe doesn't talk a lot

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.660
or seems like they
maybe don't have a place

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:33.430
to sleep that's consistent every
night, you should be that person.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:36.890
One of the best conversations
I ever had with a librarian was

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:39.180
when I said, "Oh, I'm
really kind of sad now,"

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.410
because when I was growing up,
you went to check out books,

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:45.160
and you had to check them out with
the librarian, and you could talk,

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.920
and it had like a little cardboard
think inside that they would stamp,

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.220
and I said, "It's kind of sad now

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.160
because everything is
self-checkout," and she said,

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.270
"Actually, it's really good
that it's self-checkout

00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:01.850
because now people and kids can go
pick out the books that they want

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:04.050
to pick out without feeling
embarrassed about bringing it

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:07.200
up to the counter," and
they said, "And also,"

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.760
this was the school
librarian, she said,

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:14.020
"I can tell which kids are checking
out which book multiple times,

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:17.070
and then I know that they need
that book and they need other books

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:20.770
like them and I know to order more
copies, and sometimes at the end

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:25.720
of the year if I see a kid that
has checked out a book 13 times,

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:29.750
I just tell them to take it home,
and I'll order another copy.

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:33.190
So it's actually a really
good thing that you can check

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:36.520
out books privately now as kids,"
and she said, "It's a good way

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:40.440
for me to keep track of what's
going on in their lives as well

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.010
because I see what they're reading,

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:45.860
and I know what we should be
concerned about in our school."

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:53.130 position:56%
I'm going to read a brief section
of "Girl in Pieces," if that's okay,

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:54.430
and it's the beginning of the book,

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:59.370
and the book is told,
not in chapters.

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:02.410
It's told in three
sections, and partly that's

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:07.300
to reflect Charlie's psychological
makeup at the beginning

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.910
of the book having been
on the street for so long,

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:13.000
and then as the book goes
on, the sections get longer

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.780
and a little bit more
expansive as she learns to start

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.320
to feel comfortable in the world.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:23.580
"Like a baby harp seal,
I'm all white.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:28.070
My forearms are thickly
bandaged and heavy as clubs.

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:31.850
My thighs are wrapped
tightly, too; white gauze peeks

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:34.930
out from the shorts Nurse
Ava pulled from the lost

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:38.380
and found box behind
the nurses' station.

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:42.160
Like an orphan, I came
here with no clothes.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:46.410
Like an orphan, I was wrapped in
a bedsheet and left on the lawn

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:50.790
of Regions Hospital in the
freezing sleet and snow,

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:53.930
blood seeping from
the flowered sheet.

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:58.630
The security guard who found me
was bathed in menthol cigarettes

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:02.070
and the flat stink
of machine coffee.

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:06.860
There was a curly forest of
white hair inside his nostrils.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:13.010
He said, 'Holy Mother of God,
girl, what's been done to you?'

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:15.850
My mother didn't come to claim me.

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:18.430
But, I remember the
stars that night.

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:20.890 position:56%
They were like salt against the sky,

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:25.290
like someone spilled the
shaker against very dark cloth.

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:29.210
That mattered to me,
their accidental beauty.

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:32.840
The last thing I thought
I might see before I died

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:36.690
on the cold, wet grass.

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:40.490
The girls here, they
try to get me to talk.

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:43.690
They want to know, 'What's
your story, morning glory?

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:46.260
Tell me your tail, snail.'

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:50.890
I hear their stories every day
in Group, at lunch, in Crafts,

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:55.210
at breakfast, at dinner, on and on.

00:12:55.210 --> 00:13:00.840
These words that spill from them,
black memories, they can't stop.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:05.220
Their stories are eating them
alive, turning them inside out.

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:06.520
They cannot stop talking.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.740
I cut all my words out.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:13.270
My heart was too full of them.

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:15.400
I room with Louisa.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.870
Louisa is older and her hair is

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:22.080
like a red-and-gold noisy
ocean down her back.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.530
There's so much of it,
she can't even keep it

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:27.850
in with braids or buns
or scrunchies.

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:31.010
Her hair smells like
strawberries; she smells better

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:32.690
than any girl I've ever known.

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:36.520
I could breathe her in forever.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:40.980 position:56%
My first night here, when she
lifted her blouse to change for bed,

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:44.990
in the moment before that
crazy hair fell over her body

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:50.380
like a protective cape,
I saw them, all of them,

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:52.970
and I sucked in my breath hard.

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:56.490
She said, 'Don't be
scared, little one.'

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:59.200
I wasn't scared.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.880
I'd just never seen a
girl with skin like mine."

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:07.610
So the book I'm working
on now is a book

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:12.320
about a 16-year-old girl
named Tiger Toliver who lives

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.780
in a little town outside
Tucson, Arizona,

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:19.340
and her mother dies unexpectedly.

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:22.880
Now my own mother was sort
of the impetus for the story

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.490
because when she was seven,
her mother died unexpectedly,

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:33.250
and her father put my mother
and her brother in an orphanage

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:37.720
and sent a baby sister to live
with relatives in California,

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.900
and my mother never saw
her baby sister again,

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:44.830
and she lived in that orphanage for
three years until she was adopted

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:48.280
by a lovely couple that she
considered her parents for the rest

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:52.060
of her life, but I often
thing about the memories

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:56.250
that my mother would relate to me
about her time in the orphanage

00:14:56.250 --> 00:15:00.560
or the things that she remembered
of her own mother and her father

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:05.090
and of growing up, and I just
started thinking about the stories

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:07.320
that our parents tell us
about the way that they used

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.920
to be before they were
parents and the things

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:14.830
that maybe they don't tell
us because-and I am a parent.

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:16.840
I have a 9-year-old
and a 4-year-old.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.590
So I'm thinking really
hard about these things.

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:21.810
What things do you
really tell your kids?

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:24.420
How much of your past
do you want them

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:29.400
to know before maybe it might
be a little bit too heavy

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.270
for them to bear?

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:34.240
Because my mother telling me
about her past and her life

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.100
in the orphanage was really sad.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:42.050 position:56%
Maybe in some ways that was a little
too sad for me to know at that age

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:46.470
because my perception of my
mother shifted just a little bit.

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:50.860 position:56%
Like, I felt like I needed to
almost take care of her in a way now

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.550
that I knew this little bit
of information about her.

00:15:54.550 --> 00:16:00.010
So I started thinking about
Tiger Toliver and a girl

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:04.800 position:56%
who loses her mother at the age of
16 and who's never known her father,

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:10.080
and how that death might spur her
to learn more about her mother,

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.910
and she might discover things about
why her mother was the way she was,

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:18.640
maybe like over protective, things
like that, but it's also a story

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:23.470
about building family from the
ground up because Tiger discovers

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:27.130
that she has an older half-sister
who has her own problems,

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:31.010
who maybe isn't going to be
the best mother or caretaker,

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:33.450
but comes out to take
care of Toliver anyway,

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:39.940
and the book also examines the
role of foster care in our society

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:44.030
and kids who are on the margins,
kids whose parents are unable

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:49.110 position:56%
to take care of them because of
addiction, which is huge in Arizona.

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:54.100
Like the opioid addiction in Tucson
alone is just, it's out of control,

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:58.780
and almost 42 percent of the school
age kids in Tucson alone are living

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:04.750 position:56%
in shelters or in their cars because
of the ravages of drug addiction,

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:07.930
and it's something we really
need to start thinking about.

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:10.420
So that's what that
book is about in part,

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:14.660
and it's also about the concept
of motherhood and mothering

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:17.540 position:56%
and about a girl who is very lonely,

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:21.410
who is going to undergo an
incredible transformation

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:22.860
through the death of her mother.

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:27.180
Part of it is based on how I felt
when my own mother passed away.

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:29.530
You become a different person.

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:32.550
So it's a book about grief told

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:37.880
from Tiger Toliver's
16-year-old point of view.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.460
I would love to take questions
at this point if anyone has any.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.820
I will answer any question.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:56.220
I can't really see back there.

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.120
&gt;&gt; Audience: How did you
get started as an author.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.640
What was the impetus?

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:04.840
What was the idea and
thinking at the time?

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:07.670
&gt;&gt; Kathleen: Do you mean like
more or less how I decided

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:11.490
to send something out to see
if it would get published?

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:15.390
Well, I liked writing in school
a lot, and I never thought

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:19.290 position:56%
that I would be a published
author, and I got a degree in poetry

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:23.040
because I didn't-I didn't, you
know, I never really thought

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.640
about writing fiction or,
you know, big, long books.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.510
I liked writing my short snippets
of poetry because that appealed

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:33.310
to my darker nature, and when
I started writing this book,

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:36.910
I started writing it
using that poetic voice,

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:39.900
and it took me nine
years to write this book

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:43.040
and thirteen drafts
because I had two kids.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.340
I lost my mother and my sister.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:49.510
So I stopped writing for about a
year after that, which I also want

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:54.480
to say if you're a creative person,
things take as long as they take.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.250
You know, sometimes life happens.

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:58.550
People will die.

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:00.090
You will have kids.

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:03.410
Wait it out and then go back
to work when you're ready.

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:04.710
Don't pressure yourself.

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:06.960
That's the most important
thing you need to know.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:11.310
Whatever it is, whatever story
you're trying to tell, it can wait.

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:13.570
People will still be
there to read it.

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:15.770
You need to take care of yourself.

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:22.560 position:56%
I met a literary agent and an editor
at the Taos Writers' Conference,

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:25.870
which I would recommend if you're
thinking about being a writer,

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:28.380 position:56%
and that was-that was the first time

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.750
that I'd really had some
interest in the story.

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:34.450
I didn't have any friends who
were writing fiction at that time.

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:36.000
I'd been out of school
for quite some time,

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.180
but they were really interested
in it, and I spent a lot of time

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:43.760
with one agent revising the book
in many, many different ways

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:48.910
until I found a different agent and
actually she ended up selling it

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:52.500
like quite quickly, I
think within like a week.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:57.330
So, it got very, very crazy,
but in terms of the process

00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:00.960
of writing the book and taking nine
years, you know in the beginning

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:06.130
of writing the book, Charlie had a
twin, and everything that happens

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:12.390
in this book had happened before
that story actually started,

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:15.720
and after a couple of
years, I realized, you know,

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.740
I'm not telling the story
I really want to tell

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.160
because it's making
me uncomfortable,

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:25.410
and so gradually you lose things
in the process of writing.

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:28.270
I was like, I don't
need Charlie's twin.

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:31.360
She has this best friend
who's way too supportive.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.740
The best friend goes.

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:36.450
Another best friend comes in who's
maybe a little bit more competitive

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:38.390
with Charlie.

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:42.300
Charlie had an okay
family in early drafts.

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:48.670
I eventually got rid of her family
because I needed Charlie to be

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:54.540
as alone as possible if readers,
especially the teen readers

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:58.970
that I wanted to reach, were
going to believe in her story

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:01.070
because they feel completely alone,

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:04.780
and I needed to have
Charlie be completely alone,

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:09.110
and it was through that whole
process that the story changed.

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:10.900
Other things happened.

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:15.260
There's a house early in the
book that Charlie ends at up

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:18.880
in the Minnesota winter where the
kids are being trafficked for sex,

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:23.490
and that house was based on
a house that I lived near,

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:26.220
a couple of blocks away from in
a neighborhood in Saint Paul,

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:30.040
Minnesota that's called Frog
Town, and I lived in Frog Town

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:34.970 position:56%
for 13 years, and it's one of the
poorest neighborhoods in Minneapolis

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:39.710
and Saint Paul, and it turned out
that there was a house a couple

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:45.530
of blocks from me, and they
were keeping mung girls there

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:49.170
and selling them through
the back pages of magazines,

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:53.770
and the mung girls were afraid to
go back home because of the shame,

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:58.730
and so they stayed there, and
I never forgot about that story

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:04.300 position:56%
and the fact that none of us in the
neighborhood knew what was going on.

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:07.820
Winters are long and
cold in Minnesota.

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:09.770
They last like seven months.

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:14.440
Nobody leaves their house except
to go to work and come back home.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.870
We had no idea what was
going on in that house,

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:18.800
and I thought about
that for a long time.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.830
I never forgot those girls feeling
alone and being afraid to go home

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:25.640
or wanting to run away
somewhere else, but they couldn't

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:29.970
because it was too cold, and so
I put part of that in this book,

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:33.920
and that's a way that real life
sometimes creeps into your fiction.

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:41.010
&gt;&gt; Audience: Yes, can you explain
the cover of the book, the concept,

00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:45.400
and what it means and
including with your name.

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:52.190
Is that like erased and then so the
title could also-your name looks

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:54.770
like something's going on there?

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:56.070
Thank you.

00:22:56.070 --> 00:23:00.110
&gt;&gt; Kathleen: So, Charlie Davis,
very early on you learn in the book

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:04.230
that one of the things
that gives her hope

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:09.630 position:56%
and helps her feel better is art,
and she draws comics of her friends,

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:13.240 position:56%
and she also does charcoal sketches,
and throughout the book she goes

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.770
to a library that really
exists in Tucson, Arizona.

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:19.190
All the places in the
book in Tucson are real.

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:22.370 position:56%
She goes to the downtown Joel Valdex
Library, and she takes out books

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:26.460
on the Old Masters, and
she tries to copy them,

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:30.990
and when your editor sends
you a cover copy of your book,

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:34.410
they always say things like,
"It's fabulous, and we love it,"

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:38.630 position:56%
and your job is really to say,
"Yeah, that's great," but, you know,

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:42.050
I will say honestly that I had some
hesitations on this cover because,

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:45.150
you know, those are cut
marks, right, and I was like,

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:49.630 position:56%
"I don't want to upset people," but
then the longer that I looked at it,

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:54.320
the more I liked it because the
smudges are Charlie's charcoal

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:57.470
on the paper, and if you
buy the book in a bookstore,

00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:59.560
you'll feel the texture
of the paper,

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.080
which feels like sketch paper.

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.040
So they did a really nice job.

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:06.020
So that's Charlie's
charcoal with the smudges,

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:08.830
and then they cut pieces
going through the name.

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:13.320
I think they did a fabulous job,
and it actually won a couple

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:19.480
of design awards, which I think is
great, but the cover also serves

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:24.620
as a way for readers to know
exactly what that book is about.

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:29.730 position:56%
I don't think you could look at that
book and think that that's going

00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:32.760
to be a roller coaster ride.

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:35.630
A reader who needs that book is
going to look at that book and say,

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:38.260
"Okay, this book is going to
talk about something painful,

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:41.110
and I'm going to read that
because I need to read that."

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:44.600
It tells girls who cut that
this is a book that they need.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:49.230 position:56%
It tells adults who have scars, like
me, "I'm going to read about that

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:52.780
because that's going to talk
about my experience in the world,"

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:56.160
and so I think that they
did-they had just a brilliant idea

00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:00.190
when they came up with that cover,
and I asked my agent, "You know,

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:03.540
when they do the paperback, do you
think they will change the cover?"

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:06.660
And she said, "No, it's
an iconic cover now.

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:07.960
It's the pink book.

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.630
They're never going to change
that cover," and I have come

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:14.220
to love that cover a lot.

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:17.750
&gt;&gt; Audience: Hi.

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:21.120
I came here late, and I didn't
read your book, and I apologize.

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.680 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Kathleen: Are you here for David
Baldacci because he'll be here soon?

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.010
&gt;&gt; Audience: Actually,
no, I'm here for you.

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:26.980
My daughter was like, "Whoa,
I've heard of that book.

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:29.870
I really want to go visit,"
and so, and I'm a mother

00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:33.020
of a teenage daughter
who's 14 and a mother

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:35.650
of a soon-to-be teenage
daughter who's 11,

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:39.630 position:56%
and I found your personal story very
compelling about how long it takes

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:44.880 position:56%
and it takes what it takes in order
to be creative, but-and also the bit

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.580
that you just read from your book
and the story that you just told

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:50.400
about the girls in
Minnesota, and whew.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:57.470 position:56%
So my question for you is as a
mother who's anticipating, you know,

00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:59.910
growing girls, what do you
recommend for those of us

00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:05.730
who have teenage daughters in
this very complicated world?

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:08.340
&gt;&gt; Kathleen: One, don't
forget what you felt

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:11.390
like as a teenage girl ever.

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:12.890
Like, don't forget that.

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:14.430
You need that.

00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:17.210
Two, listen.

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:20.020
Whatever they have to say, listen.

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:21.830
If they call you at
2 am and they ask

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:24.360
for a ride home, just go get them.

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:25.660
Don't' ask questions.

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:26.960
Don't lecture.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.260
Just go get them.

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:31.900
You remember exactly how hard
it was, and the thing is is

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:34.360
that you're trying to think,
"I want to protect you

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.190
so you don't feel those
feelings that I felt."

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:38.620
That's impossible.

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:40.910
All you can do is stay
by their side.

00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:42.210
That's it.

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:46.550
I wrote this book partly because
I want people to start talking

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:50.480
about why our girls are trying
to make themselves smaller.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:53.490
More than a million girls
harm themselves every year.

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:56.040
Why are they trying to
make themselves disappear?

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.260
Why? Why are we letting them?

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:02.180
The best thing that I think that
you can do if you really want

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:05.690
to be active is to go to
your daughter's school,

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:08.370
talk to her counselor or
a teacher that she likes,

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:12.320
and start a girls' club after
school or during school hours.

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:15.820
I visited a girls' empowerment
group at Tucson High School,

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:19.540
and this was the only
place that these girls felt

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:22.670
like they could get support,
sitting in this little space

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:26.660
in the band room at 9:30 am and
talking about their feelings

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:28.190
with the school counselor.

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:31.150
Like literally I think that
that group was saving some

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:32.700
of the lives of those girls.

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.020
They were in bad spots.

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:37.300
I felt honored to be sitting there
with them sharing their stories

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:41.420
with me because it's bad, and
I don't mean to get political

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:47.150
on everybody, but the person that's
in the White House, that's bad.

00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:51.690
That person is not a friend to
women, and for girls to see that,

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:56.340
that you can get elected to
that is so painful and damaging,

00:27:56.340 --> 00:28:00.080
and for girls to try to tell
people when they've been assaulted

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:03.670
and not be listened
to is so damaging,

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:07.080
and all I can tell you is
that you need to listen.

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:10.760
Try to get girls together so that
they can talk about their feelings

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:14.540
in a safe and supportive
atmosphere and just never forget

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:19.750
that even though you want their
life to be different than the life

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:23.280
that maybe you led as a
teenager, you can't control that.

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:27.710
All you can do is stick by
her side and be her parent

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:29.560
and her friend and her listener.

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:39.910
[Applause] One of the-one of the
things that I have thought a lot

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:43.100
about this year, particularly

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:45.980
because I will probably
always write difficult books

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:49.530
about difficult subjects
is the responsibility

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:54.160
of the young adult author for
teenagers who read your books,

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:59.470 position:56%
and if you're going to talk about
this stuff, it's your responsibility

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:02.630
to put hope in that book.

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:08.590
There has to be a glimmer of
hope at the end of the story.

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:12.440
A door has to be cracked, and
light has to come through,

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:15.280
or you haven't done your job.

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:18.460
You can read as many books
marketed to adults as you want,

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:21.340
and the story can end with
[inaudible] or looking

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:24.320
at the sunset, and you don't know
what happens to the characters.

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:28.280
It might turn out to be a
little dark, but for teenagers

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:33.000
who have a whole possibility
of a life in front of them,

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.510
you absolutely must have hope.

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:38.950
Hope has to be in your book, and
I give Charlie that at the end,

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:44.760
and it's a hope that she works for
on her own through trial and error

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.920
because not everybody
has access to therapists

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.110 position:56%
or has a supportive school counselor

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:53.030
or a supportive family
group that they can talk to.

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:56.620
Sometimes you have to do it on
your own, and sometimes you slip

00:29:56.620 --> 00:30:00.400
and fall, but you have to
learn that that's okay, too,

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.870
and I think that that's one of the
things that I have loved the most

00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:08.630
about the response to this book
is the fact that people feel like

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:12.200
and teenagers feel like
their story has been told

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.890
and that they have hope now

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:20.070
because I gave this character
some hope at the end of the book.

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:22.560
Do we have any more questions?

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:26.480
&gt;&gt; Audience: I just wanted to
thank you for the Writers' Almanac.

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:29.090
That got me through my
first years of teaching.

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:34.220
It aired right before I went into
the building, and I would sit

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:37.980
and wait, drink my hot
chocolate, and listen to poems,

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:39.420
and it would set me for my day,

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:42.900
and I've used them many
times in the classroom.

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:44.200
&gt;&gt; Kathleen: Right.

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.500
&gt;&gt; Audience: And in
particular remember one

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:50.970
about a-describing a dog with
cancer, and my mother had died

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:57.660
of cancer about a year prior
to that and just crying

00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:00.190
in my car before work
in the morning.

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:03.000
Anyway, it's wonderful, and I'm
glad that it's still out there

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.100
and it still exists, and do you
know Garrison Keeler personally?

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:07.520
&gt;&gt; Kathleen: I do.

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:12.340
He's a, you know, it's actually a
great character writing tool doing

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:15.160
the research for these because
he'll send you the topics.

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:16.880
They've been doing it for
a couple of years now,

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.200
and he'll send you
the topics over email,

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:22.990 position:56%
and they-it's literary biography and
history, and you have to write them,

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:26.770 position:56%
you have to research them like super
quickly and send him the material,

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:29.820
but you also have to read it
out loud kind of in his voice

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:31.420
because then he's going
to go record it,

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:34.630
so you don't really have
a lot of room for editing.

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:38.320
So I read something, and then I
have to say to myself in the corner

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:43.460
of my room surrounded by
Legos, "Today's the birthday

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:49.740
of Ludwig von Beethoven,
whose 'Ode to Joy,'" you know,

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:54.480
you have to do it in his voice,
and he's a terribly nice man,

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.830 position:56%
and I hope that he keeps doing it
for a long time, and there are three

00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:59.380
of us who do research for him.

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:02.400
So it's literally-I
learn something new

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:06.640
like literally every
day, but I like it.

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:11.680
&gt;&gt; Audience: Thank you.

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:12.980
&gt;&gt; Audience: Hello.

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:14.280
Hello.

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:15.580
&gt;&gt; Kathleen: Hi.

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:16.880
&gt;&gt; Audience: I have
a technical question.

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:18.180
&gt;&gt; Kathleen: Okay.

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:19.480
Is it about the microphone
because I can't answer that?

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.780
&gt;&gt; Audience: No, it's very nice.

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:23.050
[Laughter] My question is you
seem to be one of the few authors

00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:25.220 position:56%
that does not have a Wikipedia page.

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:26.520
&gt;&gt; Kathleen: I don't.

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:27.820
Are you offering?

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:29.120
I don't know how to do that.

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.420
&gt;&gt; Audience: Can you
explain your choice?

00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:32.390
&gt;&gt; Kathleen: [Laughter]
It's not my choice.

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:36.390
I don't know who sets that up.

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:38.710
&gt;&gt; Audience: On my way here I did
a lot of research, and [laughter]-

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:40.710
&gt;&gt; Kathleen: You can do it.

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:44.640
Make sure that you say I'm 6'2"
and that I'm willowy and blonde.

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:45.940
[Laughter]

00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:48.580
&gt;&gt; Audience: I don't know how
the other authors got it done.

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:51.190
&gt;&gt; Kathleen: I think that-I
think anybody can just go on

00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:53.280
and make a page for
anybody, can't they?

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.580
I don't know.

00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:55.950
There's only so much I can do.

00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:59.310
[Laughter] I have these kids, and
they want me to take care of them,

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:01.500
and I have to read to them,
and they're getting older.

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:02.800
&gt;&gt; Audience: Thank you.

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.100
&gt;&gt; Kathleen: Thank you.

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:05.400
That's a good question.

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:06.700
I'll tell my agent.

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:08.620
Julie, I don't have
a Wikipedia page.

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:09.920
Okay.

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:13.680
&gt;&gt; Audience: So our
15-year-old read the book,

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.530
and she kept on telling
my husband and I,

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:20.170
"You have to read this
book," and it's so gripping.

00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:23.730
It's just, it's amazing,
and I'm really surprised

00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:26.010
that the room is not overflowing.

00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:27.310
I expected-

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:28.610
&gt;&gt; Kathleen: I think this
is a pretty good crowd.

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:33.150
&gt;&gt; Audience: Yeah, but I
really expected-My question is,

00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:37.360
it might sound a bit weird,
but is there-I really feel

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:41.780
like there's a movie in the book,
and the movie is a good one.

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:43.570
Have you thought about it?

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:45.540
Has anybody approached you?

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:46.840
&gt;&gt; Kathleen: You know, I
haven't been approached,

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.990
but I would feel fine
if there was a movie.

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:50.290
I think that would be great.

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:51.790
Like I'm not one of
those writers who's like,

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:54.660
"Oh, movie, my precious gem."

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:56.520
I think that would be awesome.

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:58.000
Do you know what I mean?

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.490
Like I would watch that movie.

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:01.050
I think that could be a good movie.

00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:02.350
I would be totally excited.

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:05.770 position:56%
You know, I like all this stuff that
comes along with being an author,

00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:07.450
I love getting these letters.

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:10.300
I like people coming up to me
in the bookstore and saying,

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:12.640
"Are you the person who wrote that
book on that child [inaudible]?"

00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:15.120
I like meeting people.

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:17.840
Movie? Sounds like a
good brass ring to me.

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:20.030
I'll take it, you know.

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:22.940
So that would be great, and so you
said your husband read this book,

00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:24.240
too?

00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.540
&gt;&gt; Audience: Yeah, we're
reading it together.

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:26.840
&gt;&gt; Kathleen: You know I
think that's really great.

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:29.160
I think that brings up a good
point that if there are books

00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:30.650
that you're a little worried

00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:34.280
about your teenagers
reading, read them together.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:38.370
You know, it might like help
you as much as it helps them,

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:39.900
and it gives you something
to talk about.

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:43.600
Like your teenagers, they're
not just people you forget about

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:46.350
and say, "Go watch TV by yourself,
and you go to school every day

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:50.050
for eight hours and I see you
at night for like 35 minutes."

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:51.360
Read the book with them.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:53.640
Just like you watch a movie
or talk about a TV show

00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:56.610
because that can be a great
way to open up a conversation

00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:59.350
that maybe before you were a
little afraid-you were afraid

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:03.360
of how you'd start it, and it can
create a lot of, I think, empathy

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.440
and communication between parents
and their kids reading together.

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.030
I love reading with my kids.

00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:10.960
We end up talking about
some really great stuff.

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:17.210
So, I'm sorry there's not a
bigger crowd, but I like it.

00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:19.090
[Laughter] Some people are
here for David Baldacci,

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:20.490
and they are just like,
"What am I watching?

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:25.410
This is not what I came for."

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:26.710
So, you know-

00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:28.010
&gt;&gt; Audience: I have
a second question.

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:29.310
&gt;&gt; Kathleen: Oh, sure.

00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:31.210
&gt;&gt; Audience: I just wanted
to know a little bit more

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:36.690
about the-what happened for
you when you did connect

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:38.630
with a literary agent and-

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:39.930
&gt;&gt; Kathleen: Like when I connected?

00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:43.080
&gt;&gt; Audience: Yeah, how that
all played out and just sort

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.940
of what the process was, yeah.

00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:47.790
&gt;&gt; Kathleen: Well there's
no-the process, you know,

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:50.200
if you want to find an agent,
one of the ways you can do is go

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:53.360
to a writers' conference
and pay extra

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:56.390
to have a little private manuscript
consultation, and they'll look

00:35:56.390 --> 00:36:00.520
at like 20 pages and offer you
advice, and sometimes in my case

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:02.770
with that agent, she
offered to represent me.

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:06.140
I didn't know anything about
that process at the time.

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:07.760
I was like, "Oh, this sounds great.

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.060
Of course, love me.

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:11.370
I may not ever get an agent
again," and I signed with her,

00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:13.040
and it turned out in
the end her vision

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:16.960
for the book was not
my vision for the book.

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:21.760
She really wanted to steer the
book in a more adult direction,

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.550
and I didn't want to go there
because I had a young character

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:28.960
and I was a young person, and so
we parted ways like very amicably,

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:34.010
and then I simply got on my
computer, and I looked up agents,

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:36.860
and I saw what books they had
represented that might be similar

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:40.000 position:56%
to mine, and I will tell you no lie.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.150
One of the reasons that I sent a
query to my agent, Julie Stevenson,

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:49.440
was because she looked
really nice in her picture.

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:52.320
[Laughter] She had a good
bio, but looking at her,

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:55.890
I just felt this connection like,
"I bet she would like my book,"

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:59.130
and I can't-I cannot
explain it, but she did.

00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:00.890
She really championed this book.

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:03.510
She got it right away.

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:07.550
She sent me notes on that
book and how she would edit it

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:10.480
and where she was going to
send it and what her vision was

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:13.490
for it before I even
signed with her.

00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:16.130
So if you're looking for an agent,

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:19.050
make sure that you find
someone who's enthusiastic

00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:21.910
about that process
and about your book.

00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:24.880
First and foremost, they
should really love that book,

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:26.790
and they should want
to work with you.

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:30.810 position:56%
You know, don't find someone who has
maybe like a whole stable of writers

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:34.870
because maybe you'll feel, you
know, lost amid all those writers.

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:36.680
I found somebody who
was committed to me,

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:39.490
and I made the right decision.

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:40.820
&gt;&gt; Audience: Congratulations.

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:42.120
&gt;&gt; Kathleen: Thank you.

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.560
It's been a great year.

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:45.860
Hi.

00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:47.160
&gt;&gt; Audience: Hi.

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:49.150
I was wondering what would
you say your favorite book

00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:52.150
or author would be and why?

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:54.480
&gt;&gt; Kathleen: When I was
growing up or right now?

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.780
&gt;&gt; Audience: Both.

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:58.140
&gt;&gt; Kathleen: So when I was
growing up, the first book

00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:03.130
that I truly loved that I felt like
was speaking to me was "Catcher

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:07.450
in the Rye," and it was my
mother's old paperback from 1952

00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:10.210
where Holden Caulfield is wearing
what they call in the book,

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:14.050
you know, his people killing head,
but he was depressed and suicidal,

00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:17.230
and I hadn't read that in a book
yet, and I was like, "My God,

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:20.910
that's me," and as I read
that book as an adult,

00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:23.440
I can see that there were
problems with Holden's character,

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:26.810
but as a teenager, I loved
that book, and I still love it,

00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:29.210
and I reread it every year.

00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:36.670
I'm also wearing my "Wrinkle
in Time" t-shirt because I love

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:39.660
that book, and I am
so looking forward

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:41.430
to seeing the movie, aren't you?

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:44.150
Oprah is in it.

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:45.450
That's right.

00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:47.570
I would like Oprah to
play Charlie Davis.

00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:48.870
I would watch that.

00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:53.200 position:56%
Some of the books that I've recently
read that I really liked were

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.760
"The First Time She
Drowned," by Kerry Kletter,

00:38:55.760 --> 00:39:00.150 position:56%
which is a young adult novel, "Girls
in the Moon," by Janet McNally,

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:01.450
which is a young adult novel

00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:05.140
about a girl whose mother
was an Indy pop musician

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:07.590
in the 90s, and I love that story.

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:09.700
It's a lot, it's about
finding yourself and finding

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:13.790
who your parents are and
forging a life for yourself.

00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:20.440
&gt;&gt; Audience: Okay, well, I'm
one of those people who came

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:22.150
for the next talk,
so I just got here.

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:23.450
&gt;&gt; Kathleen: Oh, hi.

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:24.750
Thanks for coming.

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:26.050
Thanks for staying.

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:27.350
I hope it was informative.

00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:29.270
You want to see-you
can see my book cover.

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:30.800
&gt;&gt; Audience: Who's the artist?

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:37.930
My other question is, you know,
you may have answered this already

00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:43.790
in your talk, so one
is how do you overcome

00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:48.250 position:56%
like when you don't get inspiration
anymore, like you run dry generally?

00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:50.090
And the second question
is do you ever,

00:39:50.090 --> 00:39:53.950
ever like ponder how people
will interpret, you know,

00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:56.790
what you're saying, and
how do you handle it

00:39:56.790 --> 00:40:00.230
when people misinterpret
what you wrote

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:03.790
in your email feedbacks
or snail mail?

00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:05.090
Thank you.

00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:06.450
&gt;&gt; Kathleen: Oh, you
mean like if I respond

00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:08.730
to a person who writes me a letter?

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:11.660
&gt;&gt; Audience: Well, like,
let's say like you're writing,

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:14.540
and you have one interpretation.

00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:15.840
&gt;&gt; Kathleen: Oh.

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:17.140
&gt;&gt; Audience: But like
have you ever had people

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:20.360
like either misunderstand
you or give

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.220
like a totally different
interpretation

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:25.420
than you really liked, and could
you describe some of those?

00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:26.920
&gt;&gt; Kathleen: Well, first,
I think that, you know,

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:30.290
everybody who reads a book is going
to come away with different things

00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:33.390
about that book, and you
could have like ten people

00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:36.650
who have read the same book,
and all ten of them are going

00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:39.230
to have a different opinion of
it, and all ten of them are going

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:41.820
to find something in that
book that really touched them

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:44.390
that might be different
from the other ten people.

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:46.960
So that's the reason I
love novels and writing

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:52.790
because there isn't just one
yes or no, and in the new book

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:55.700
that I'm working on right now,
Tiger Toliver really loves to read,

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:58.360
but she doesn't call
herself book smart.

00:40:58.360 --> 00:40:59.660
She just likes the act of reading.

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:03.100
She doesn't like sitting
in her English Lit class

00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:05.190
because every time she really
wants to talk about something

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:09.780
that happened in the book, the
teacher says, "Well, actually,

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:13.670
no" because they're more interested
in telling her about literary terms

00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:17.060
and what she should be thinking
and how to dissect a book and not

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:20.630
about how a book makes you
feel, and I'm more in that camp.

00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:22.200
I like how a book makes you feel.

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:25.850
I like thinking about craft,
too, but if somebody comes

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:28.930 position:56%
up with a different
interpretation of my book, you know,

00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:30.230
I'm not going to argue with them.

00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:31.530
I think that's interesting.

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:34.510
I would probably say, "Well,
where did you see that?

00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:35.810
Where did you find that?"

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:39.460
And as for inspiration, and I will
end because I only have one minute,

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:41.530
and I know like you're
waiting for David Baldacci

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:43.050
and he's probably here [laughter].

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:49.810
It's like "Get her off," but
so last night, they, you know,

00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:52.420
they gave this really great
award to Dennis Johnson,

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:55.750
who is a great fiction writer
who passed away, right,

00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:59.830
and I was telling my agent that he
visited this program that I used

00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:01.520
to work for at the
University of Minnesota,

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:05.390
and one of the graduate students
asked him, "So, you know,

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:10.380
like what do you do like if you
don't know what to write and you're

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:12.270
like you have writer's block?"

00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:13.990
And he was like, and I don't know

00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:17.830
if this is true what he said
or if he just, you know.

00:42:17.830 --> 00:42:19.130
I like to think it's true.

00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:22.110
He was a really funny
person in person.

00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:24.340
I really liked meeting him.

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:28.940
He said, "[Sigh] You
know, I watch a lot of TV.

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:34.260
I just-I got this cabin that
I-you know, I watch a lot of TV,

00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:40.480
and then my wife comes over to me,
and she says, 'We need a new roof,

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:45.100
and I get up and turn off the TV,
and I go write, and I sell a book,

00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:48.260
[laughter], and I go out to her,
and I do some teaching gigs,

00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:53.230
and then I come back, and I turn
the TV on, and then a couple

00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:57.580
of years later she says, 'We've
got to pay the electric bill,

00:42:57.580 --> 00:42:59.480
and I get up, and
I turn off the TV,

00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:01.690
and then I go write
something, and I sell it."

00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:03.220
And you know what?

00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:04.640
That's inspiration.

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:09.250
Sometimes you just get up and
turn off the TV and put your butt

00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:11.880
in the seat, turn off
your iPhone, your iPad,

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:15.890 position:56%
your i-Whatever and write the story.

00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:17.190
That's it.

00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:18.990
Thank you so much.

00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:23.210
[Applause]

00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:24.870

been a presentation

00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:26.870
of the Library of Congress.
