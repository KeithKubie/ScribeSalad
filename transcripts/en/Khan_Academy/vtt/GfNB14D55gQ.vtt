00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's do some scale and indirect
measurement problems.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.060
So they say use the scale
diagram to the right to

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.180
determine-- I think this is
the scale diagram they're

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.540
talking-- it's really
above the question.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.770
And they want to determine--
let's see first, the length of

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:16.460
the helicopter.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.080
When they say the scale diagram,
you notice this

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.380
helicopter looks pretty small.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.080
I don't know how big your screen
is, but looks maybe,

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.680
one or two inches, depending
on what resolution you're

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.090
watching this video on.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.250
But they're saying this
helicopter is

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.170
much bigger than that.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.420
They're saying just this little
distance right here--

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.720
just that little distance, that
little white box there--

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.195
that's actually a foot on
the real helicopter.

00:00:37.195 --> 00:00:40.380
So what they're able to do is to
draw a small version of the

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.860
helicopter and essentially give
us a ruler and tell us

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.920
that that little distance
is equivalent to a foot.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.200
And this whole distance right
here, that whole distance

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.895
right there, is equivalent to
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 feet.

00:00:53.895 --> 00:00:54.780
Did I get that right?

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.060
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.660
So this thing is equal
to 7 feet.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.850
So given that, let's try to
answer their question.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.760
So the first one, the length
of the helicopter.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.860
So that's from cabin to tail, is
that distance right there.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.480
Let's see how many of
these things it is.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.970
So if I take that right there,
let me see if I can copy and

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.650
paste that.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.880
So if I-- let's see, if I copy
it and then I paste it,

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.160
there's one right there.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.870
One.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.800
Edit, paste.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.050
Two right there.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.080
Edit, paste.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.770
And then we get not
quite three.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.480
Almost three, but not quite.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.530
We get about that far.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.890
So it looks like about-- so
this right here is-- this

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.500
right here is 7 feet.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.520
That right there is
another 7 feet.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.380
And I know that, because
that is 7 feet

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.530
according to the scale.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.130
And then this looks like
we got about that far.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.370
So it looks like this is
maybe another 5 feet,

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.410
if I were to estimate.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.540
Actually, if we went to go all
the way to the end of the

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.210
tail-- if we went to the end
of here-- it actually looks

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.300
like another 7 feet.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.470
We actually complete
three 7 feets.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.500
So I would say that part a,
I would go it's 27 feet.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.430
Sorry, not 27.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.390
21 feet.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.940
7 feet times 3 is equal to 21.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:23.910
I'd go part one.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.650
Because if you go all the way
to this tippy, tippy of the

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.370
rear rotor right there, then
you're going to get 21.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.450
And you're going to get three
of these lengths.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.180
Let's do part b.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.680
The height of the helicopter.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.700
Floor to rotors.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.360
So from here-- from
floor to rotors.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.060
Well, I'll go from down
here to the rotors.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.870
They might be talking about
this floor, but who knows?

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.400
So what is this distance
right here in feet?

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.030
What is that distance?

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.530
We could just eyeball
a little bit.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:54.900
They didn't give us
a vertical scale.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.350
We could just-- this scale looks
like about that high.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.020
So that would be about 7 feet.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.510
Let me copy and paste that.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.650
So let me copy it.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.630
Let me paste it.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.920
So that would be 7
feet right there.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.900
Then if I were do another one,
we're getting about another

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.270
1/2 of 7 feet.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.190
So that'd be another
3 and 1/2 feet.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.655
So I would say that this
is 7 right there.

00:03:30.655 --> 00:03:33.190
And then we get about
3 and 1/2.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:39.110
So 7 plus 3 and 1/2
is 10.5 feet.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.340
The length of one main rotor--
and I think the main rotor--

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.300
they're talking about this
length right there.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.370
That length right there.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.400
That is the length of
one main rotor.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.890
Or actually, this length
right here.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.010
That is the length of
one main rotor.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.140
And let's compare it to
this scale over here.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.750
So let's compare it.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.770
That's 7 feet.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.240
So let's copy it.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.530
And then let's paste it.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.360
I lost it.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.890
So let me copy it.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:20.510
Let me copy and then paste.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.690
So that's one length.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.390
So we want one rear rotor.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.260
So that's 7 feet right there.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.540
7 feet right there.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.860
And we can do another one.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.930
The important thing is to
get the idea of it.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.400
You don't have to get the
exact measurement.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.010
We're not about to go out there
and build a helicopter.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.380
So what is this length?

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.140
We have 7 feet.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.740
And then we have 1, 2, 3,
about another 4 feet.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.560
So I would go with part c, I'd
go with 11 feet for one rotor

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.970
if we're getting to see
this actually head on.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.980
Maybe it's a little bit longer
if it's at an angle.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.630
But that gives us our
general idea.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.700
Actually it looks a little
bit longer than that.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.990
But the idea is as long as you
understand how I'm using the

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.840
scale is the main thing.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.090
The width of the cabin.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.750
So here-- that's the cabin
width right there.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.690
This distance.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.110
That distance right there
is the cabin width.

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.880
And if we compare it to this
right here, we already said

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.850
that this right here
is 7 feet roughly.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.500
Edit, copy, edit, paste.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.990
So that is 7 feet.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.130
That looks like about the
width of the cabin.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.140
It's a good estimate.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.090
So the width of the cabin,
I would say, is 7 feet.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.790
And then find the diameter
of the rear rotor system.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.290
The rear rotor system
is this right here.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.650
That is the rear rotor system.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.610
So if we were to copy and paste
our 7 foot lengths--

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.310
actually, let me copy and
paste the actual ruler.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.745
So this is our actual ruler.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.840
So how long is the rear
rotor system?

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.590
Let's look at our ruler.

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:59.490
Looks like 1, 2, 3, 4 feet
is my best estimate.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.690
So I'd say the diameter of the
rear rotor system is 4 feet.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.600
So you might have already known
how to do this, but now

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.550
you have a good sense.

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.090
Look, this is telling us that
this little distance on the

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.000
picture is actually equivalent
to a foot.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.440
And you just compare it to the
actual picture, and you know

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.680
how big the actual
helicopter is.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.700
That's all that's
going on there.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.890
Let's do another scale and
indirect measurement problem.

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.530
So it says on a Sunday morning,
the shadow of the

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.370
Empire State Building
is 600 feet long.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.910
At the same time, the shadow
of a yard stick, which is 3

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.900
feet long, is 1 foot
5 1/4 inches.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.990
How high is the Empire
State Building?

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:46.800
So we could say height of Empire
to length of shadow.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:59.210
So length of the shadow of
Empire should be equal to

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:05.690
taking the length of a yard
stick, so height of yard

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.710
stick-- I'm assuming that
they're pointing up the yard

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:12.610
stick like a skyscraper-- height
of yard stick divided

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:22.240
by length of shadow
of yard stick.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.040
Now this problem looks a little
bit hairier because we

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.140
have feet here, and then we
have 1 foot 5 1/4 inches.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.310
And you do everything
in inches.

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:30.460
And you do everything in feet.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.795
And the interesting
thing is here.

00:07:31.795 --> 00:07:33.370
You can look at the units.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:37.900
As long as we calculate this in
feet and we calculate this

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:41.580
in feet down here, these units
are going to cancel out.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:46.590
If you have x feet divided by
600 feet, in this case, the

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:47.490
feet are going to cancel out.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:49.230
You'll have a unit-less
quantity.

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:51.520
So it's really just going
to be a pure ratio.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.290
Same thing here.

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:53.490
You can do it in feet.

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:54.940
Or you can do it in inches.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.600
And you could actually do this
in feet and do this side in

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.960
inches, because you get
feet divide by feet.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:00.920
The feet cancel out.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.090
The inches cancel out.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:03.435
So they stay unit-less.

00:08:03.435 --> 00:08:06.060
So it actually becomes a lot
easier when you can keep the

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.160
right side in inches and
you can keep the

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.790
left side in feet.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:12.790
So let's say the height of the
Empire State Building is x.

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:18.250
So we could say x feet over
the length of the shadow.

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:20.110
The shadow of the Empire State
Building is 600 feet.

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:26.590
Over 600 feet is equal to the
length of a yard stick

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:27.220
standing up.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.500
Or the height of a yard stick.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.220
Let's do it in inches.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.980
3 feet long is 36 inches.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.080
36 inches.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.270
And I want to show you that
the units work out.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:38.750
36 inches divided by the
length of its shadow.

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.460
1 foot 5 1/4 inches.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:42.030
What's that?

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:43.840
One foot is 12 inches.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.760
12 plus 5 1/4 is 17 1/4.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:52.780
Or 17.25 inches.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.000
And notice the units
cancel out.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.700
Feet divided by feet.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:57.970
Inches divided by inches.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:59.900
So they just become
pure ratios.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:05.270
x/600 is equal to 36/17.25.

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:07.630
The reason why I could use feet
here and inches here is

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:08.940
because the units cancel out.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.270
I want to make that very,
very, very clear.

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:15.140
Now we can just cross multiply,
which is essentially

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:19.200
just multiplying both sides of
the equation by 600 and 17.25.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:35.940
So 17.25 times x is going to
be equal to 36 times 600.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:43.200
And then we can divide
both sides by 17.25.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:49.600
So x is equal to 36 times
600 over 17.25.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.010
And let's get the
calculator out.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:58.350
So x is equal to 36 times
600 divided by

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:03.690
17.25 is equal to 1,252.2.

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:05.400
Let's just round it.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:13.220
So x is equal to 1,252.2 feet,
which is almost 1/4 of a mile.

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.300
So the Empire State Building
is pretty high.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.120
But this is pretty neat, because
this is something that

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.820
you could actually do.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:24.230
You could actually measure the
shadow of a skyscraper and

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:26.250
then you could actually
measure the

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.900
shadow of a yard stick.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:32.180
And then doing that, you can
actually figure out the height

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.330
of a skyscraper.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.920
Which is pretty neat, because
if you didn't know how to do

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.910
this math, you'd have to get
into a helicopter, and drop a

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:40.940
huge-- I mean it'd be a much
harder thing to do.

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:43.620
So hopefully, you found that
pretty interesting.
