00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.530
- [Instructor] The first
long-term English colony

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.710
in North America was established
at Jamestown in 1607.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.070
No one expected that it
would last very long.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.480
It was intended to be a get rich

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.270
quick scheme for its investors,

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.900
who hoped they would find gold
in the swamps of Virginia.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.560
They didn't, but they did
find that they could grow

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.060
a valuable cash crop in tobacco.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.160
Over the next century more and more

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.060
English settlements began
haphazardly popping up

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.240
along the Atlantic
seaboard of North America.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.740
Some founded as religious refuges,

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.600
some as proprietary colonies,
some as joint stock companies.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.110
Compared to the Spanish
Empire in the New World,

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.020
which had clear goals and
unified colonial systems,

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.860
the English Empire was
pretty disorganized.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.290
Internal strife like the English Civil War

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.150
and the Glorious Revolution,

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.570
meant that the government
kept changing hands,

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.560
and some monarchs took
a more hands on approach

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.220
towards the colonies than others.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.740
This benign neglect of
the American colonies

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.800
left them to develop self-government

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.600
and a sense of independence.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.400
But even in the early 1770s
most American colonist

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.270
thought of themselves as English citizens

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.000
who were part of the British Empire.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.640
They read the same books,
spoke the same language,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.230
drank the same tea, and
fought the same enemies

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.420
as their counterparts
on the British Isles.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.250
Nevertheless, there was
something clearly different

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.870
about the 13 colonies in North America.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.740
After all, there were more
than 30 British colonies

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.570
in the Caribbean and
North America by 1776.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.460
So why did those 13 in
particular unite and rebel?

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.190
So that leaves us with a question.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.290
During this period of
colonial development,

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.710
how British were the American colonists?

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.880
What aspects of society brought them

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.580
closer with the mother country,

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.520
and what aspects brought on
resistance to Britain's control?

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.780
Let's take a look at the major political,

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.810
social and economic
exchanges that took place

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.400
between the British Empire
and the 13 colonies,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.400
and compare whether they either brought

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.950
the colonies in the mother
country closer together

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.450
or created resentment that
drove them further apart.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.880
Okay, first let's look at
the political exchanges

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.570
between the colonies and England.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.750
One thing that they shared
was a political culture.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.030
A shared sense that all citizens,

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.870
both at home and in the colonies,

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.930
enjoyed the rights of Englishmen.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.060
So I would say that the political
culture that the colonies,

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.910
and later the United States,
inherited from England

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.930
was a factor that united them with Empire.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.500
But because the colonies were far away

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.280
from the mother country and because

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.520
the mother country was
often too distracted

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.930
by its own problems to take an
active role in managing them,

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.910
the colonies also developed their own

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.070
local representative governments.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.110
This led to a tradition of
self-rule and self-taxation,

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.160
and the colonists were irate any time

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.950
the British colonial governors attempted

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.730
to interfere with their
representative bodies.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.990
So I would say this tended to divide

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.620
the colonies from England.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.960
What else happened politically?

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.870
Well, during this time
period there was also

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.420
a lot of warfare against competing

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.490
colonial powers in North America,

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.040
particularly France and Spain,

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.840
who were supported by
Native American allies.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.440
For the colonists warfare
against a common enemy

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.980
strengthened their sense that they

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.430
belonged to the British Empire.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.840
But they also felt
frustrated when they didn't

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.520
receive enough help
defending their settlements

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.310
or when British regulars
insulted their colonial militias.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.030
So these conflicts were probably both

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.870
a source of unity and division between

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.210
the colonists and the British Government.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.760
Next, let's look at some of the social

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.680
and cultural exchanges that happened

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.140
between the colonies and
England during this period.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.760
A big area of cultural
exchange was in religion.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.440
America became the destination

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.520
of choice for religious dissenters

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.990
since most of the colonies
were fairly tolerant

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.730
of a broad range of religions.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.780
The established Church of England

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.820
was pretty weak in the colonies.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.970
So religion in general
didn't tie the colonies

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.470
together with the mother country.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.770
But in the early 1700s both
England and the colonies

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.960
experienced a shared religious

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.150
revival with the Great Awakening.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.610
One of the most popular
preachers throughout the colonies

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.140
was the English parson George Whitefield.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.640
So we might put religion down as

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.310
something that both united and divided

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.930
the colonies from Great Britain.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.340
Another shared cultural
experience was the Enlightenment,

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.480
which spread ideas about
reason and self-government

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.930
through books and pamphlets that

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.040
were read all over the Atlantic world.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.040
Ben Franklin, the American
printer and scientist,

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.720
was as famous in England
as he was in the colonies.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.730
So the shared ideas of the Enlightenment

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.700
brought the Empire together,
at least at this point.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.480
Another aspect of cultural exchange

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.080
was fashion and consumer goods.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.950
The elite American colonists dressed

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.480
like the English gentry, built
homes in the English style,

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.730
imported luxury goods from England,

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.510
and drank tea like the
fashionable British.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.240
So these cultural exchanges
definitely were a force

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.700
uniting the colonies
with the mother country.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.440
Last, let's examine economic exchanges.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.430
One thing that the colonies had in common

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.800
with the rest of the British Empire was

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.760
their dependence on slave
labor to produce cash crops.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.130
British investors and
the owners of slave ships

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.050
and plantations in the Caribbean

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.720
were deeply involved in
the system of slavery.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.120
And so were the 13 American colonies,

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.970
which produced food for enslaved laborers,

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.080
turned slave produced molasses into rum,

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.690
and shipped enslaved
people across the Atlantic,

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.310
not to mention the American
slave owners in the South.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.920
Slavery was central to the united

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.720
economic prosperity of the British Empire.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.310
Another central aspect of the

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.950
British Empire's economy was mercantilism,

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.130
an economic philosophy that championed

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.580
using colonies as sources of raw materials

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.950
and as markets for finished goods.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:58.320
Mercantilism both helped and
hindered the American colonies

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.300
by making sure that their raw materials

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.250
got preferential treatment in England,

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.870
but also by preventing them from

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.850
developing industries of their own.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.680
So I would say that mercantilism both

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.080
united and divided the
colonies from the Empire.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.970
Along with mercantilism
came the Navigation Acts,

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.880
a series of laws passed by Parliament

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.610
that attempted to prevent
the American colonies

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.520
from trading with other countries.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.030
Basically a way to
enforce that the benefits

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.230
of mercantilism went to England alone.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.050
But there were two major problems
with the Navigation Acts.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.100
First, the British Government
rarely enforced them,

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.510
especially when it was
occupied with other matters.

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.100
The other problem was that even when

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.310
efforts were made to
enforce the Navigation Acts,

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.000
American merchants responded by

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.890
smuggling and bribing officials,
not by obeying the law.

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:46.740
So the Navigation Acts worked to

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.740
divide the colonies from the Empire,

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.820
both because they didn't work and because

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.840
they hampered American's
belief in free trade.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.900
Taking a look at these
three categories as a whole,

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.970
you can see that the
colonists had mixed feelings

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:01.960
about their role in the British Empire.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.750
In terms of social and cultural exchanges

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.790
it seems like the colonies were tied into

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:10.220
a greater world of ideas that
spanned across the Atlantic.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.810
But both politically and economically

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.590
there were developments
that bonded the colonies

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.420
closer together with Great Britain

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.570
and developments that had the colonies

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.170
tugging at their leashes
and trying to run free.

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:23.820
These mixed feelings might help

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.070
to explain why in 1754 the colonies

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.670
had not yet pursued their independence.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.440
But are there some things
that I've identified here

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:37.250
as promoting unity that might
not be so unifying by 1776?

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.870
What changed between this
point and the signing

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.630
of the Declaration of Independence

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:45.553
that pushed the colonists off
the fence and into revolution?
