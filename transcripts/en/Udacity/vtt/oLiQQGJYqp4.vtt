00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:06.440
We have organized the materials in this course, into eight major units,

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:13.040
this chart illustrates those eight units. So starting from the top left,

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.600
the first unit has to do with Fundamentals of presentation and recent, Panning,

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.870
Common Sense Reasoning. Analogical Reasoning, Metacognition that we just talked

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:29.200
a little about, Design &amp; Creativity, Visuospatial Reasoning, and Learning.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.020
Now let's look at each of these circles, one at a time. So in the first part,

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.820
dealing with the Fundamentals of this course. We'll be dealing with certain,

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.740
knowledge representations, and reasoning strategies. Two of the major

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.330
knowledge representations that we'll discuss in the first part of this course,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.960
are called Semantic Networks, and Production Systems. Three of

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.980
the reasoning strategies, are called Generate and Test, Means-End Analysis, and

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.850
Problem Reduction. Note that, the arrows here imply an ordering.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.190
There is an ordering. In that, when we are discussing our Production Systems,

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.470
we might allude to things that we are discussing in the Semantic Networks.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.790
Similarly, when we discuss Means-End Analysis, we might allude to things that we

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.220
are discussing in Generate and Test. However. It is important to note also,

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.640
that these three methods are completely independent from each other.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.750
It's just that we are going to discuss them, in the order shown here.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.090
Similarly these two knowledge representations, are independent from each other.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.380
It's simply that in this course, we'll discuss them in this order.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.110
So the second major unit in this course. Pertains to Planning. Planning is

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.910
kind of problem solving activity whose goal is to come up with plans, for

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.200
achieving one or more goals. Before we discuss Planning, we'll

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.540
discuss Logic as a knowledge representation. This knowledge representation,

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.620
will then enable us to discuss Planning in a systematic way. The third

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.260
major unit in this course is common sense reasoning. Common Sense Reasoning,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.700
pertains to reasoning about every day situations in the world. As an example,

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.880
I may give you the input, John gave the book to Mary. Note the input,

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.919
does not specify who has the book at the end. But, you can draw that

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:16.160
inference easily. That is an example of Common Sense Reasoning. In our course,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.840
we'll discuss both knowledge representations like frames, as well as methods for

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.790
doing Common Sense Reasoning. As we discussed earlier,

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.890
when we were talking about the architecture of a cognitive system,

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.540
Learning is a fundamental process within deliberation. And therefore, we will be

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.390
visiting the issue of Learning many, many times throughout this course. However,

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.860
we also have a unit on Learning, which has several topics in it. There are other

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.350
topics in Learning, that do not show up in this particular. Circle here but

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.200
are distributed throughout the course. Another major unit in our course is

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.340
Analogical Reasoning. Analogical Reasoning is, reasoning about novel problems or

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.040
novel situations, but, analogic to what we know about familiar problems, or

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.390
familiar situations. As I mentioned earlier, Learning is distributed throughout

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.580
this course. Therefore Learning comes here in Analogical Reasoning also. In fact

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.010
Learning by recording cases appeared in the Learning topic as well as here, and

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.120
you can see explanation based Learning occurring here. Visuospatial Reasoning is

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.280
another major unit in our course. Visuospatial Reasoning pertains to

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.020
reasoning with visual knowledge. As an example, I might draw a diagram and

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.530
reason with the diagram. That's an example of Visualspatial Reasoning.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.190
In the context of Visualspatial Reasoning, we're talking both about

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.695
Constraint Propagation, and using that to do Visualspatial Reasoning. Design

00:03:38.695 --> 00:03:44.010
&amp; Creativity is the next topic in our course. We want to build AI systems,

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.760
that can deal with novel situations, and come up with creative solutions.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.570
Design is an example of a complex task which can be very, very creative,

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.920
where we are discussing a range of topics in the context of Design &amp; Creativity.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.250
So in the next topic in our courses Metacognition,

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.310
we have already come across a notion in Metacognition,

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.780
when we were talking about the architecture of the cognize system. Metacognition

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.940
pertains to thinking about thinking. And we'll discuss a range of topics and

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.920
then, we will end the course by talking about Ethics in Artificial Intelligence.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.040
This figure illustrates all the eight major units once again, as well as

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.920
the topics within each major unit. I hope this will give you mental map

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.190
of the organization of the course as a whole. In preparing this course, we came

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.300
up with a ordering of the topics, which will interleave many of these topics. So

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.340
we will not do the entire first unit, before we go to the entire second unit and

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.060
so on. Instead, we will do some parts of first unit, then go to

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.150
some other part that follows conceptually from it, and so there will be

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.620
some interleaving among these topics. And one aspect of the personalization is,

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.322
that you are welcome to go through these topics in your own chosen order.

00:04:59.322 --> 00:05:03.360
You don't have to stay, with the kind of order that we'll be using.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.990
This is an exciting agenda. I hope you are as excited as I am.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.920
There are very few, opportunities where we can talk about exotic topics,

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.700
like Analogical Reasoning, and Creativity, and Metacognition. And,

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.800
in this particular course, we'll talk about all of them together.
