look at the post-war and cross some of

look at the post-war and cross some of
 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.650
look at the post-war and cross some of
the common discursive divides that

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660
the common discursive divides that
 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.899
the common discursive divides that
genuinely reproduce the political

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909
genuinely reproduce the political
 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.230
genuinely reproduce the political
divides of the Cold War and I know that

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240
divides of the Cold War and I know that
 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.990

you know just just before me Reinhold

the suggested that you know post-war is

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729
the suggested that you know post-war is
 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.210
the suggested that you know post-war is
maybe not the most important topic to

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220
maybe not the most important topic to
 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.429
maybe not the most important topic to
connect to the architecture in state and

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439
connect to the architecture in state and
 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.260
connect to the architecture in state and
that may be true but what I think is

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270
that may be true but what I think is
 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.170
that may be true but what I think is
interesting is that in Reverse the

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180
interesting is that in Reverse the
 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.429

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.640
attaching architecture in the state to a

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650
post-war topic actually does open up
 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.920

something really interesting and so just

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689
topic and I don't know if this is just a
 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.510

now when it comes to the topics you're
 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.979
now when it comes to the topics you're
going to see here that the state was one

going to see here that the state was one
 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.990

organized if that is even when you know
it employs all of the architects that

and you know i'm going to set up a few

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510
and you know i'm going to set up a few
 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.900
and you know i'm going to set up a few
things that are for me interesting about

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910
things that are for me interesting about
 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.330
things that are for me interesting about
these topics so there is a self-serving

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340
these topics so there is a self-serving
 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.970
these topics so there is a self-serving
framework for the panel but i like

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980
framework for the panel but i like
 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.070
framework for the panel but i like
holding on to the notion of the second

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080
holding on to the notion of the second
 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.020
holding on to the notion of the second
world even though that's not a term

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030

that's been consistently used to

that's been consistently used to
 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.979
that's been consistently used to
describe this geopolitical context that

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989
describe this geopolitical context that
 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.870
describe this geopolitical context that
we're going to deal with in all the

we're going to deal with in all the
 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.660
we're going to deal with in all the
papers but I like holding on to it

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670
papers but I like holding on to it
 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:33.830
papers but I like holding on to it
because it highlights the real

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840
because it highlights the real
 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.430
because it highlights the real
structural that is economic discursive

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440
structural that is economic discursive
 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.949
structural that is economic discursive
and even cultural difference from the

and even cultural difference from the
first and the third world and which in

first and the third world and which in
and that difference inevitably

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820
and that difference inevitably

highlights to me the fact that we have

highlights to me the fact that we have
not yet developed a real interpretive

not yet developed a real interpretive
 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.220
not yet developed a real interpretive
framework that is specific to that

even basically as each a historian of
the Second World material may have

the Second World material may have
 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.320
the Second World material may have
developed in their own work and attitude

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330
developed in their own work and attitude
 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.690
developed in their own work and attitude
and even a theory about what it means to

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700
and even a theory about what it means to
 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.540
and even a theory about what it means to
do history or write history of these

public discussion about methodological

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380
public discussion about methodological
 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.550
public discussion about methodological
and interpretive specificity of this

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560
and interpretive specificity of this
 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.540
and interpretive specificity of this
context now so as as I'm happy that

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550
context now so as as I'm happy that
 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.600
context now so as as I'm happy that
we have a conference that allows us to

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610
we have a conference that allows us to
 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.999
we have a conference that allows us to
cross the political boundaries that

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.009
cross the political boundaries that
 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:34.490
cross the political boundaries that
general divide the discourse I'm also

happy that we actually have a panel
 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:38.059
happy that we actually have a panel
that's going to concentrate on some of

that's going to concentrate on some of
 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:39.770
that's going to concentrate on some of

in some way the kind of the change in

creative intelligentsia so if there is

01:13:26.689 --> 01:13:26.699
creative intelligentsia so if there is
 

01:13:26.699 --> 01:13:28.040

than we're again used to in
 

01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:31.120
than we're again used to in
architectural history so how do you

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:31.130
architectural history so how do you
 

01:21:31.130 --> 01:21:32.750
architectural history so how do you
evaluate you

01:21:32.750 --> 01:21:32.760
evaluate you
 

01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:36.820
evaluate you
or maybe there's evidence evidentiary

01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:36.830
or maybe there's evidence evidentiary
 

01:21:36.830 --> 01:21:41.570
or maybe there's evidence evidentiary
dilemma if I can respond again I mean

01:21:41.570 --> 01:21:41.580
dilemma if I can respond again I mean
 

01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:44.720
dilemma if I can respond again I mean
that's for me that this kind of problem

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:44.730
that's for me that this kind of problem
 

01:21:44.730 --> 01:21:46.640
that's for me that this kind of problem
between directive and respondents and

01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:46.650
between directive and respondents and
 

01:21:46.650 --> 01:21:48.650

01:21:48.650 --> 01:21:48.660
execution is part of this instability
 

01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:51.760
execution is part of this instability
that that I'm trying to highlight that

01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:51.770
that that I'm trying to highlight that
 

01:21:51.770 --> 01:21:54.820
that that I'm trying to highlight that
yes I mean as as documents these

01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:54.830
yes I mean as as documents these
 

01:21:54.830 --> 01:21:57.470

directive has a different status and

01:21:57.470 --> 01:21:57.480
directive has a different status and
 

01:21:57.480 --> 01:21:59.180
directive has a different status and
trying to try to work out what that

01:21:59.180 --> 01:21:59.190
trying to try to work out what that
 

01:21:59.190 --> 01:22:02.420
trying to try to work out what that
status is is a complicated process but

01:22:02.420 --> 01:22:02.430
status is is a complicated process but
 

01:22:02.430 --> 01:22:04.550
status is is a complicated process but
this is one of the reason this is one of

01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:04.560
this is one of the reason this is one of
 

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:08.210
this is one of the reason this is one of
the reasons why i think it's it's

01:22:08.210 --> 01:22:08.220
the reasons why i think it's it's
 

01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:11.690
the reasons why i think it's it's
interesting at least two tests yeah as a

01:22:11.690 --> 01:22:11.700
interesting at least two tests yeah as a
 

01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:14.120
interesting at least two tests yeah as a
kind of experiment you know what did a

01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:14.130
kind of experiment you know what did a
 

01:22:14.130 --> 01:22:16.430
kind of experiment you know what did a
number of different subjects a number of

01:22:16.430 --> 01:22:16.440
number of different subjects a number of
 

01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:18.950
number of different subjects a number of
different individuals do in response to

01:22:18.950 --> 01:22:18.960
different individuals do in response to
 

01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:21.230
different individuals do in response to
a directive you know how and so for that

01:22:21.230 --> 01:22:21.240
a directive you know how and so for that
 

01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:23.440
a directive you know how and so for that
reason like being very precise and

01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:23.450
reason like being very precise and
 

01:22:23.450 --> 01:22:26.120
reason like being very precise and
looking at this problem with biography

01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:26.130
looking at this problem with biography
 

01:22:26.130 --> 01:22:29.330
looking at this problem with biography
and really individual agency the agency

01:22:29.330 --> 01:22:29.340
and really individual agency the agency
 

01:22:29.340 --> 01:22:31.820

of the architect or the team of

01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:31.830
of the architect or the team of
 

01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:35.150
of the architect or the team of
architects in responding to say the

director that you know the modernism is

01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:38.490
director that you know the modernism is
 

01:22:38.490 --> 01:22:41.110

not satisfactory for example or that

not satisfactory for example or that
 

01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:44.230
not satisfactory for example or that
excess is no longer valid you know

01:22:44.230 --> 01:22:44.240
excess is no longer valid you know
 

01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:48.580
excess is no longer valid you know
there's a range of positions and I think

01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:48.590
there's a range of positions and I think
 

01:22:48.590 --> 01:22:51.310
there's a range of positions and I think
they're still yet to be explored but i

01:22:51.310 --> 01:22:51.320
they're still yet to be explored but i
 

01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:54.140
they're still yet to be explored but i
think i would probably support the idea

01:22:54.140 --> 01:22:54.150
think i would probably support the idea
 

01:22:54.150 --> 01:22:55.970
think i would probably support the idea
that there are different these

01:22:55.970 --> 01:22:55.980
that there are different these
 

01:22:55.980 --> 01:22:58.570
that there are different these
directives and these statements do

01:22:58.570 --> 01:22:58.580
directives and these statements do
 

01:22:58.580 --> 01:23:02.150
directives and these statements do
occupy a particular furthermore the we

01:23:02.150 --> 01:23:02.160
occupy a particular furthermore the we
 

01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:03.770
occupy a particular furthermore the we
talked about intentional limit in the

01:23:03.770 --> 01:23:03.780
talked about intentional limit in the
 

01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:05.960
talked about intentional limit in the
last panel but the idea that when you

01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:05.970
last panel but the idea that when you
 

01:23:05.970 --> 01:23:07.400
last panel but the idea that when you
get an architect describing their

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:07.410
get an architect describing their
 

01:23:07.410 --> 01:23:09.740
get an architect describing their
intention in a journal so forth it's

01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:09.750
intention in a journal so forth it's
 

01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:13.370
intention in a journal so forth it's
always like how you treat that is a

01:23:13.370 --> 01:23:13.380
always like how you treat that is a
 

01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:16.850
always like how you treat that is a
really specific question it goes beyond

01:23:16.850 --> 01:23:16.860
really specific question it goes beyond
 

01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:18.320
really specific question it goes beyond
even sort of looking at the particular

01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:18.330
even sort of looking at the particular
 

01:23:18.330 --> 01:23:20.540
even sort of looking at the particular
product that comes out of their

01:23:20.540 --> 01:23:20.550
product that comes out of their
 

01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:21.920

01:23:21.930 --> 01:23:24.020
interpretation
and the rest of the dance but sort of

01:23:24.020 --> 01:23:24.030
and the rest of the dance but sort of
 

01:23:24.030 --> 01:23:26.600
and the rest of the dance but sort of
what is a statement what is the value of

01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:26.610
what is a statement what is the value of
 

01:23:26.610 --> 01:23:28.450
what is a statement what is the value of
that statement even I think is a

01:23:28.450 --> 01:23:28.460
that statement even I think is a
 

01:23:28.460 --> 01:23:32.210
that statement even I think is a
question for me it was important to

01:23:32.210 --> 01:23:32.220
question for me it was important to
 

01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:36.530
question for me it was important to
think about how this director directives

01:23:36.530 --> 01:23:36.540
think about how this director directives
 

01:23:36.540 --> 01:23:38.870
think about how this director directives
are changeable how they are in stable

01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:38.880
are changeable how they are in stable
 

01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:41.450
are changeable how they are in stable
how they contradict each other and try

makes sense to me I mean I mean I've

01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:11.070
makes sense to me I mean I mean I've
 

01:25:11.070 --> 01:25:13.550
makes sense to me I mean I mean I've
encountered many of the tropes I'm sure

that's the thing that

01:25:15.229 --> 01:25:15.239
that's the thing that
 

01:25:15.239 --> 01:25:18.560
that's the thing that
is that you've all basically described

01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:18.570
is that you've all basically described

here of sorts which I think actually

01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:31.679
here of sorts which I think actually

actually let us rework it a little bit

01:25:35.810 --> 01:25:35.820
actually let us rework it a little bit
 

01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:37.399
actually let us rework it a little bit
and now it's going to look different

01:25:37.399 --> 01:25:37.409
and now it's going to look different
 

01:25:37.409 --> 01:25:39.709
and now it's going to look different

he sounds like a break actually it's

01:25:41.629 --> 01:25:41.639
he sounds like a break actually it's
 

01:25:41.639 --> 01:25:45.890
he sounds like a break actually it's
just a step on top of that yeah can I

01:25:45.890 --> 01:25:45.900
just a step on top of that yeah can I
 

01:25:45.900 --> 01:25:48.739
just a step on top of that yeah can I
ask you questions in responses and he

01:25:48.739 --> 01:25:48.749
ask you questions in responses and he
 

01:25:48.749 --> 01:25:51.500
ask you questions in responses and he
said i think what what's always floating

01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:51.510
said i think what what's always floating
 

01:25:51.510 --> 01:25:54.229
said i think what what's always floating
behind these statements and i think some

01:25:54.229 --> 01:25:54.239
behind these statements and i think some
 

01:25:54.239 --> 01:25:55.549
behind these statements and i think some
of your line of questioning is really

01:25:55.549 --> 01:25:55.559
of your line of questioning is really
 

01:25:55.559 --> 01:25:58.220
of your line of questioning is really
the question of commitment and the

01:25:58.220 --> 01:25:58.230
the question of commitment and the
 

01:25:58.230 --> 01:26:00.200
the question of commitment and the
status of these directives and we're

01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:00.210
status of these directives and we're
 

01:26:00.210 --> 01:26:02.359
status of these directives and we're
talking about control and the question

01:26:02.359 --> 01:26:02.369
talking about control and the question
 

01:26:02.369 --> 01:26:04.279
talking about control and the question
is you know why would you do this you

01:26:04.279 --> 01:26:04.289
is you know why would you do this you
 

01:26:04.289 --> 01:26:06.350
is you know why would you do this you
know why would architects actually make

01:26:06.350 --> 01:26:06.360
know why would architects actually make
 

01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:08.540
know why would architects actually make
these statements why would they why

01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:08.550
these statements why would they why
 

01:26:08.550 --> 01:26:11.629
these statements why would they why
would they not try to update in some

01:26:11.629 --> 01:26:11.639
would they not try to update in some
 

01:26:11.639 --> 01:26:14.180
would they not try to update in some
ways and not a thats not necessarily an

01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:14.190
ways and not a thats not necessarily an
 

01:26:14.190 --> 01:26:16.310
ways and not a thats not necessarily an
option but I feel like that's kind of

01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:16.320
option but I feel like that's kind of
 

01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:17.689
option but I feel like that's kind of
what I mean for me the questions are

01:26:17.689 --> 01:26:17.699
what I mean for me the questions are
 

01:26:17.699 --> 01:26:19.970
what I mean for me the questions are
actually on our love at this table it's

01:26:19.970 --> 01:26:19.980
actually on our love at this table it's
 

01:26:19.980 --> 01:26:21.830
actually on our love at this table it's
like how do we deal with this fact but i

01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:21.840
like how do we deal with this fact but i
 

01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:24.020
like how do we deal with this fact but i
think you know in the in the second what

01:26:24.020 --> 01:26:24.030
think you know in the in the second what
 

01:26:24.030 --> 01:26:25.879
think you know in the in the second what
what all of these contexts shares that

01:26:25.879 --> 01:26:25.889
what all of these contexts shares that
 

01:26:25.889 --> 01:26:27.799
what all of these contexts shares that
there is no way out this is the

01:26:27.799 --> 01:26:27.809
there is no way out this is the
 

01:26:27.809 --> 01:26:30.049
there is no way out this is the
situation so then how do you you know

01:26:30.049 --> 01:26:30.059
situation so then how do you you know
 

01:26:30.059 --> 01:26:32.390
situation so then how do you you know
clearly they're having to find ways to

01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400
clearly they're having to find ways to
 

01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:35.029
clearly they're having to find ways to
work within it but the sort of the

01:26:35.029 --> 01:26:35.039
work within it but the sort of the
 

01:26:35.039 --> 01:26:37.279
work within it but the sort of the
development from story for me is it is

01:26:37.279 --> 01:26:37.289
development from story for me is it is
 

01:26:37.289 --> 01:26:38.540
development from story for me is it is
important i think it is actually

01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:38.550
important i think it is actually
 

01:26:38.550 --> 01:26:41.060
important i think it is actually
something that talks about the kind

01:26:41.060 --> 01:26:41.070
something that talks about the kind

socialism timeline or relationship to
 

01:26:45.389 --> 01:26:50.270
socialism timeline or relationship to
time before it but i would just clarify

01:26:50.270 --> 01:26:50.280
time before it but i would just clarify
 

01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:51.830
time before it but i would just clarify
one thing from my perspective there's a

01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:51.840
one thing from my perspective there's a
 

01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:54.620
one thing from my perspective there's a
profound break at the moment of

01:26:54.620 --> 01:26:54.630
profound break at the moment of
 

01:26:54.630 --> 01:26:57.229
profound break at the moment of

Khrushchev in a sense that is the RT is
infallible it's like the Pope says women

01:27:00.439 --> 01:27:00.449
infallible it's like the Pope says women

the notion of infallibility and I think

01:27:12.690 --> 01:27:12.700
the notion of infallibility and I think
 

01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:15.150
the notion of infallibility and I think
that's a really profound moment in this

01:27:15.150 --> 01:27:15.160
that's a really profound moment in this
 

01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:17.910
that's a really profound moment in this

cruise ship transformation I mean I I
 

01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:20.400
cruise ship transformation I mean I I
think so too in some sense but I also

01:32:28.090 --> 01:32:28.100
particular example of public space were
 

01:32:28.100 --> 01:32:32.830
particular example of public space were
just given a little space for people to

01:32:32.830 --> 01:32:32.840
just given a little space for people to
 

01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:34.930
just given a little space for people to
do what they want when in the situation

01:32:34.930 --> 01:32:34.940
do what they want when in the situation
 

01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:37.690
do what they want when in the situation
when they couldn't throw out the rest of

01:32:37.690 --> 01:32:37.700
when they couldn't throw out the rest of
 

01:32:37.700 --> 01:32:39.730
when they couldn't throw out the rest of
their lives basically I mean to do what

01:32:39.730 --> 01:32:39.740
their lives basically I mean to do what
 

01:32:39.740 --> 01:32:41.320
their lives basically I mean to do what
they want within certain extent of

01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:41.330
they want within certain extent of
 

01:32:41.330 --> 01:32:44.770
they want within certain extent of
course but it's it's a relief place I

01:32:44.770 --> 01:32:44.780
course but it's it's a relief place I
 

01:32:44.780 --> 01:32:49.510
course but it's it's a relief place I
think yeah I I yeah I don't I think

01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:49.520
think yeah I I yeah I don't I think
 

01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:53.440
think yeah I I yeah I don't I think
I saw it related to well I like the

01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:53.450
I saw it related to well I like the
 

01:32:53.450 --> 01:32:55.360
I saw it related to well I like the
argument of the paper you know people

01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:55.370
argument of the paper you know people
 

01:32:55.370 --> 01:32:58.060
argument of the paper you know people
are somehow people's daily life is

01:32:58.060 --> 01:32:58.070
are somehow people's daily life is
 

01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:59.650
are somehow people's daily life is
somehow taken into account actually

01:32:59.650 --> 01:32:59.660
somehow taken into account actually
 

01:32:59.660 --> 01:33:01.600
somehow taken into account actually
maybe even in that your trajectory of

01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:01.610
maybe even in that your trajectory of
 

01:33:01.610 --> 01:33:03.960
maybe even in that your trajectory of
the paper they want or they are winning

01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:03.970
the paper they want or they are winning
 

01:33:03.970 --> 01:33:06.910
the paper they want or they are winning
against the education agenda I also

01:33:06.910 --> 01:33:06.920
against the education agenda I also
 

01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:08.350
against the education agenda I also
think there's an aspect to that like

01:33:08.350 --> 01:33:08.360
think there's an aspect to that like
 

01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:10.570
think there's an aspect to that like
happiness and satisfaction of the mass

01:33:10.570 --> 01:33:10.580
happiness and satisfaction of the mass
 

01:33:10.580 --> 01:33:12.580
happiness and satisfaction of the mass
is that this particular point are proof

01:33:12.580 --> 01:33:12.590
is that this particular point are proof
 

01:33:12.590 --> 01:33:17.170
is that this particular point are proof
that the system works and so I think

01:33:17.170 --> 01:33:17.180
that the system works and so I think
 

01:33:17.180 --> 01:33:18.820
that the system works and so I think
that is actually really important just

01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:18.830
that is actually really important just
 

01:33:18.830 --> 01:33:20.950
that is actually really important just
like we have arrived that the new way of

01:33:20.950 --> 01:33:20.960
like we have arrived that the new way of
 

01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:23.110
like we have arrived that the new way of
life or at least we finally meet the new

01:33:23.110 --> 01:33:23.120
life or at least we finally meet the new
 

01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:25.510
life or at least we finally meet the new
way of life because feminism is imminent

01:33:25.510 --> 01:33:25.520
way of life because feminism is imminent
 

01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:30.070
way of life because feminism is imminent
yeah I don't feel that I mean in

01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:30.080
yeah I don't feel that I mean in
 

01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:32.320
yeah I don't feel that I mean in
ideological terms i think there's fairly

01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:32.330

01:33:32.330 --> 01:33:35.130

that's there's very little that's

01:33:35.130 --> 01:33:35.140
that's there's very little that's
 

01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:38.320
that's there's very little that's
unmediated in socialist realist beauty

01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:38.330
unmediated in socialist realist beauty
 

01:33:38.330 --> 01:33:42.040
unmediated in socialist realist beauty
so you bet your essential phrase I think

01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:42.050
so you bet your essential phrase I think
 

01:33:42.050 --> 01:33:42.970
so you bet your essential phrase I think

understanding beauty that you arrive at
an unmediated moment it's not that's how

01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:47.840
an unmediated moment it's not that's how
 

01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:50.290
an unmediated moment it's not that's how
it's going to work because I mean beauty

01:33:50.290 --> 01:33:50.300
it's going to work because I mean beauty
 

01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:54.160
it's going to work because I mean beauty

are trying to you know come up with

are trying to you know come up with
 

01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:43.180
are trying to you know come up with
solutions as you said that they were

trying to understand the first part what
is it that was one

01:34:46.549 --> 01:34:46.559
is it that was one
 

01:34:46.559 --> 01:34:48.229
is it that was one
from that program and that's one of the

01:34:48.229 --> 01:34:48.239
from that program and that's one of the
 

01:34:48.239 --> 01:34:49.759
from that program and that's one of the
problems you have an ideology that

01:34:49.759 --> 01:34:49.769
problems you have an ideology that
 

01:34:49.769 --> 01:34:52.489
problems you have an ideology that

that is can I just kind of follow up on
