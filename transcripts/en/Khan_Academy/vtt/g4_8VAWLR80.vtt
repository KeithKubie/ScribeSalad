00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.710
- With my students, a lot
of them have not had a lot

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.570
of academic success.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.828
They've faced a lot of obstacles.

00:00:07.828 --> 00:00:10.360
(chiming)

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.070
That's what's great about Khan Academy is

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.030
they have success.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.540
So I think that really builds them up.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.840
They're all working on the same program,

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.870
but they're working on
very different things

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.960
and the great thing about that is,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.423
there's no judgment.

00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:29.200
(cheering)

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.050
They actually love Khan
Academy so much that they

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.360
approached me to start a club that was

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.656
specifically doing Khan Academy.

00:00:38.656 --> 00:00:42.303
They're asking to do math work

00:00:42.303 --> 00:00:44.420
outside of the regular school day,

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.410
like totally their own motivation.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.940
These kids are creating social connections

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.950
and boosting their self esteem

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.870
and just feeling great about themselves

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.988
all through the connection
of doing Khan Academy.

00:00:57.988 --> 00:01:00.488
(light music)
