1
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.980
Okay.
So we're going to finish up on nucleus Phillips substitution,
the sn two,

2
00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:09.570
where we're spending so much time looking at how you prove a mechanism and then

3
00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:13.110
look at the,
that,
the elimination,
that second order,

4
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.730
and then the substitution and elimination that our first order kinetically.

5
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.320
So we've looked at that proving mechanisms that is disproving mechanisms by

6
00:00:24.781 --> 00:00:28.410
stereochemistry,
by rate,
law,
by rate,
constant,
varying,

7
00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:32.700
all the different components of the reaction.
And finally,
there's another way,

8
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.770
which is to look at structure,

9
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.080
which you can do either with quantum mechanics or,
uh,
by X-ray.

10
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.580
Uh,
and the problem,
remember,
is this really subtle distinction.

11
00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:50.010
One that probably doesn't make much difference,

12
00:00:50.011 --> 00:00:53.850
but if you're really looking carefully at mechanism and want to understand them,

13
00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:58.350
it's an interesting question,
which is,
is there an energy minimum at the top?

14
00:00:58.351 --> 00:01:02.760
Is there an intermediate in the concerted sn two reaction,

15
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.880
or is it just the transition state?
And of course,

16
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.870
they blend into one another as the,
as the,
uh,

17
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.770
stability of the pentavalent intermediate.
If there were one,
uh,
gets,

18
00:01:13.771 --> 00:01:18.570
uh,
less and less.
So the,
the interesting thing is,

19
00:01:18.571 --> 00:01:22.320
is when you have the nucleophile leaving group and the carbon in the middle try

20
00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:25.800
Vaillant carbon,
is it actually a pentavalent carbon?

21
00:01:25.801 --> 00:01:28.290
Is there some stability associated with that?

22
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.330
So you could imagine a ranging groups like oxygen's with their unshared pairs on

23
00:01:33.331 --> 00:01:38.160
the left and right and a planar carbon cad I and in the middle and see whether

24
00:01:38.161 --> 00:01:41.040
there's a bond there.
How are you going to get them?

25
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.250
Things that remember that the,

26
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.300
the non bonded distances between Adams when they're in contact is about twice as

27
00:01:48.691 --> 00:01:53.580
big as bonded distances.
Right?
So if the thing is,

28
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.630
is only marginally stable,
what's going to keep it from flying apart?

29
00:01:57.631 --> 00:02:00.750
How will it last long enough for you to look at it?
Well,

30
00:02:00.751 --> 00:02:04.830
you can put other things in a molecule that hold those pieces in place.

31
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.540
Like this set of three aromatic rings of the anthropocene system.

32
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.351
Okay,

33
00:02:10.351 --> 00:02:14.610
now we've got the groups up there on top where we want and the question is going

34
00:02:14.611 --> 00:02:17.640
to be,
well first,
how do we get them there?

35
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.630
The thing in the middle is started as an Ester,
right?

36
00:02:21.631 --> 00:02:25.650
But we want it to be a cad ion with a vacant p orbital in the middle.

37
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.610
So what you do is react it with the molecule we talked about before,

38
00:02:29.611 --> 00:02:33.690
mayor vines reagent,
which is a way of giving methyl groups.

39
00:02:33.691 --> 00:02:37.800
It's got a great leaving group on it.
A dye methyl ether is the leaving group.

40
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.050
So we can have,
uh,
a substitution reaction and put a methyl group on.

41
00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:45.180
And now the carbon has a positive charge.

42
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.800
Although if you want to be careful about not all the positive charges on carbon,

43
00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:53.940
because the unshared payers on the knee on the adjacent oxygen's,
of course,

44
00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:57.360
they're mixing with that vacant orbital.
Okay?

45
00:02:57.361 --> 00:03:01.450
So we've got our tribal carbon cad,
I in the middle,
uh,

46
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.740
there we see it and uh,
on,
there should be this,
this,

47
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.030
an eye on that was left from the original mayor vine salt.

48
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.500
And the people who did the ex-ray work were surprised to find that it was not BF

49
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:15.430
four minus,

50
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.730
but B to f seven minus it had it had gotten together with another BF three.

51
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.090
So that's neither here nor there,
but it's what was there in the crystal.

52
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.980
So now they have the oxygen's next to the central carbon.

53
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.490
And to remember calculated when you had a cat ion with waters on both sides of a

54
00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:39.750
travail and carbon.
Was that at the uh,

55
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.290
symmetrical pentavalent quote geometry?
Uh,

56
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:48.960
it was a transition state.
Okay.
So we don't,
they,
if you believed in,

57
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.690
in the theory,
you wouldn't expect there to be stability here.
Now,

58
00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:56.710
how do you know if there's stability?
How do you know if there are bonds there?

59
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.000
Well,
you can look in the paper that's cited down there on the bottom right,

60
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.160
and it shows a picture and you can see that indeed there are bonds there,
right?

61
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.520
That's supposed to engender a laugh.
I see Chris smiling.
Why do you smile?

62
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.250
They just drew the bonds,
right?
How do you know there are bonds there?
Well,

63
00:04:18.251 --> 00:04:22.750
there's one interesting thing.
This,
the structure is symmetrical,
has drawn.
Okay.

64
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.000
And you noticed these funny shapes of the atoms have what they are are ellipses

65
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.040
with uh,
uh,
octa cutout of them to show the size of the axes.

66
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.010
And one thing you major in X-ray is how much?
The eye,

67
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.890
the Adam's vibrate.
Okay.

68
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.080
And those show how much it vibrates in the three principal directions for

69
00:04:44.081 --> 00:04:46.990
vibration.
Right.
And if we look at that,

70
00:04:46.991 --> 00:04:49.510
see 19 the central carbon there,

71
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.680
notice it's not a long gated,
right?

72
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.630
It would be a long gated if it,

73
00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.280
if it vibrated with great amplitude back and forth.
Right.

74
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.060
It would move a lot in that direction.
So it could be,

75
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.830
remember in ex-ray what you see is the average structure over many molecules.

76
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.290
It could have been that one of them is like this.

77
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.810
Another one is like this and other ones like this.

78
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.160
I know there's like this and the average would appear to be in the middle.
Right?

79
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.360
But it would have a long displacement on the average.
You see?

80
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.370
But that's not what you see there.

81
00:05:24.371 --> 00:05:27.070
It could be like this bell clap or sometimes they're,

82
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.890
sometimes they're but on average in the middle.

83
00:05:29.891 --> 00:05:34.150
But it's not because it's not stretched out that way.
Okay.

84
00:05:34.151 --> 00:05:37.120
But that still doesn't answer the question whether their bonds there,

85
00:05:37.121 --> 00:05:40.810
it couldn't be in the middle,
but no bonds.
Okay.

86
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.840
So let's look right edge on at the,

87
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.410
at the central carbon and ask the question,

88
00:05:47.411 --> 00:05:50.920
how far apart are those two oxygens?
If the,

89
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.830
if the interaction is repulsive,

90
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.280
then they should move apart if it's attractive,

91
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.370
should move together compared to what?
Well,

92
00:06:01.371 --> 00:06:05.990
the authors compared it with the two carbons they were attached to,
hey,

93
00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:08.270
what's your 5.02 Ostrom's apart?

94
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.900
And the white is 4.86 so they'd been drawn together.

95
00:06:14.301 --> 00:06:19.250
The distance is shortened by 0.1,
six songs,
drums as if they're being sucked in,

96
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.740
right?
So,
uh,

97
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.550
that looks like there's a pentavalent carbon that's actually attracting those

98
00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:29.210
adjacent oxygens.
So this was published in a distinguished journal,

99
00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:31.190
the Journal of the American Chemical Society.

100
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.310
And notice that it's not only that distance,

101
00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:37.310
but you can see also that the angles are distorted.

102
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:42.530
The w instead of those being hundred 20 degree angles out on the left there,
uh,

103
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.800
one of them is larger and one of them is seven degrees smaller.

104
00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:49.820
It's bent in as if it's being sucked by the central carbon so that there's a

105
00:06:49.821 --> 00:06:54.020
bond there.
So pentavalent seem to be a safe inference.

106
00:06:54.021 --> 00:06:55.760
And that was the subject of this paper.

107
00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.440
But if they did compared to what,

108
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.430
and just had hydrogen in the middle,
instead of that positive carbon,

109
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.820
it turned out they were sucked in even further.

110
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:13.160
So instead of being 4.84 or whatever it is,
it's for,
it's a,

111
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:16.370
it's 4.75 songs.
Drums,
right.

112
00:07:16.371 --> 00:07:21.200
So much for that proof that the,
that these groups are being sucked in,
right?

113
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.700
With nothing in the middle,
just the hydrogen,
they're sucked in.

114
00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.650
Now notice that that wasn't all that was on.

115
00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.680
There wasn't just that positive carbon.
There were,
there were these other things,

116
00:07:34.681 --> 00:07:35.920
the oxygen's in the methyls.

117
00:07:35.921 --> 00:07:40.560
So there was some space to that which could have pushed things apart.
Right?

118
00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:45.930
So now lacking that push apart,
they come together closer.

119
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:50.130
So from one point of view,
that's reasonable,
but why should they come together?

120
00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:55.050
It's not a pull to the central carbon.
It seems to be a push.

121
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.110
Where is the push coming from?
Can anybody see

122
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:08.530
what pushes those methoxy groups?
The oxygen's toward the center.

123
00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:13.560
<v 1>Helen,
this screen,</v>

124
00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:19.760
<v 0>one of the methyls being pushed by.</v>

125
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.393
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

126
00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.040
<v 0>it must be some push to bend those ankles in.</v>

127
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:35.140
Anybody got an idea,
Chris,
with the hydrogen?
Ah,
the hydrogens,

128
00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:36.440
right?

129
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:41.440
There's a clips and there's repulsion there that causes them to bend in right

130
00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:46.190
now.
You can put it,
you can put instead of a positive carbon,

131
00:08:46.191 --> 00:08:50.750
you can put oxygen in the middle with this extra group on it and that you see

132
00:08:50.751 --> 00:08:53.300
does push them further apart,

133
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:58.470
but still they're bent in a little bit,
right as compared to the carbon.

134
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:03.930
But the central oxygen is only slightly repulsive compared to the carbon.

135
00:09:03.931 --> 00:09:07.380
So the carbon is not pulling things in at all.
It's pushing them out,

136
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:11.970
trying to fight against that hydrogen pushing into the methyl out on the side.

137
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.080
Now if you have BF three in the middle,

138
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:21.380
which clearly has the vacant orbital on Boron has very small other things on the

139
00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:26.340
Boron,
so they're not pushing apart and those other things are flury.

140
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:28.080
So not only are they're small,

141
00:09:28.081 --> 00:09:31.140
but they're withdrawing electrons and making that be orbital,

142
00:09:31.141 --> 00:09:32.730
especially low in energy.

143
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:38.150
Then you can see them generally genuinely being sucked in right further than in

144
00:09:39.301 --> 00:09:44.190
any of the other cases.
Okay.
As compared there to the,

145
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.230
to the positive carbon in the middle.

146
00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:51.950
Now if you try to make the things on the outside more willing to give up their

147
00:09:52.651 --> 00:09:56.820
electrons diet,
that is higher homos to make stronger bonds.
Right.

148
00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:01.470
And make it oh minus rather than ch three.
Oh,

149
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.230
so we have the minus charge raising those homos,

150
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.460
then indeed it forms a bond,
but not to bonds.

151
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:10.650
It's unsymmetrical.
Right.

152
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.060
So one of them is a,
is a reasonable bond.

153
00:10:15.061 --> 00:10:19.680
The other one is just a non bonded interaction.
Right.
And in fact,

154
00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:22.980
it turns out that this is assault.
It's an anti on.

155
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:27.930
So there's a positive,
uh,
cat die in nearby a potassium,

156
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:31.860
which makes it a little bit unsymmetrical so that it's better to have the minus

157
00:10:31.861 --> 00:10:35.700
charge on the right near the potassium cad I,
and then on the left.

158
00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:37.320
So that also helps distort it.

159
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:43.650
Now I remember that as compared to the,
uh,
an eye and that was calculated,

160
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:48.000
which again was said to be by calculation,
the transition state.

161
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:50.821
Okay.

162
00:10:50.821 --> 00:10:54.090
So here are the whole bunch of things they studied and I don't want to spend the

163
00:10:54.091 --> 00:10:57.450
time going through this in great detail,
but compared to what?

164
00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:00.900
Compared to just having a hydrogen in the middle,
right,

165
00:11:00.901 --> 00:11:02.520
to see what these distances are.

166
00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:06.150
And then in the case where c plus was in the middle,
right,

167
00:11:06.151 --> 00:11:08.400
they made the c plus that that way,

168
00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:12.800
but it's not such a great c plus because of the,
of the,
uh,

169
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:17.580
vacant orbital on the carbon being mixed with the unshared pairs on the adjacent

170
00:11:17.581 --> 00:11:21.490
oxygen's a,
but if you have,
uh,
uh,

171
00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:23.460
if you have a bow,

172
00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:27.180
if the central atom is bonded to oxygen or sulfur,

173
00:11:27.181 --> 00:11:31.920
which has these extra electrons,
that seems to use up the vacant orbital.

174
00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:35.400
So it's not so good at bonding and therefore sucking things in.

175
00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:40.350
If you have fluorine on Boron,
then the,
as we said,

176
00:11:40.351 --> 00:11:42.600
the electron withdrawal lowers the energy.

177
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:46.510
And indeed it does seem to suck it in to give a pent availa data,

178
00:11:46.511 --> 00:11:47.344
but in the middle.

179
00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:52.610
But if you have a higher homos on the neighbor of the Boron giving their

180
00:11:53.501 --> 00:11:55.690
electrons to the,
to the Boron,

181
00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.830
then that's a better source of electrons for the Boron than the neighboring

182
00:11:59.831 --> 00:12:03.070
atoms are.
And you can see in these cases,
okay,

183
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:07.390
so if you'll look up this whole bunch of things plotted in this particular way,

184
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.070
you can see,
for example,

185
00:12:09.071 --> 00:12:14.071
there's a boron with two chlorine in the middle and meth oxides on both sides.

186
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:19.360
And the,
the bar then shows the two different bond distances.

187
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:24.190
So it's unsymmetrical,
one is short,
one is long,
it's not a pentavalent carbon,

188
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:26.950
right?
So there's some that are like that on the right,

189
00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.960
very different and unsymmetrical.

190
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:33.100
Then there's some on the left that are about equal bond distances,

191
00:12:33.101 --> 00:12:36.340
right and left that are symmetrical.
Right?

192
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:40.150
And there's our reference with hydrogen in the middle,
right?

193
00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:45.340
And it's pressed in to give somewhat short distances by that,

194
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:49.870
by the hydrogen.
Pushy on the methyl is,
as we spoke about before,

195
00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:54.910
if you have bore on,
on the middle,
it's not sucked in very much,
right?

196
00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:59.200
Unless you have that case with fluorine on the Boron.

197
00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:03.220
And then it attracts enough that you can make a pentavalent Adam in the middle.

198
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:08.620
Right?
But most of the Boron are tetra coordinate.

199
00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:12.460
That is unsymmetrical,
not,
uh,
not a single minimum,

200
00:13:12.461 --> 00:13:16.870
but a double minimum day.
And if you look at the two cases of carbon,

201
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:20.920
the one with,
uh,
with oxygens on each side there,

202
00:13:20.921 --> 00:13:22.900
on the left is,
uh,

203
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:27.190
is a symmetrical but not short,
right?

204
00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:32.140
And the one on the right is,
is a short,
one of them is short,

205
00:13:32.141 --> 00:13:34.270
but the other,
as long it's not symmetrical.

206
00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:39.450
So there's no sign from this exercise for a pentavalent intermediate of the sn

207
00:13:41.471 --> 00:13:45.880
two sword being stable,
it seems genuinely to be,
uh,

208
00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:50.800
to be just a maximum on the way across.
Okay.
That's a,

209
00:13:50.801 --> 00:13:54.160
so it's a transition state as calculated by quantum mechanics.

210
00:13:54.161 --> 00:13:59.050
So that should give us a little more confidence perhaps in the reliability of

211
00:13:59.051 --> 00:13:59.861
quantum mechanics,

212
00:13:59.861 --> 00:14:04.861
which of course can't take into account all the neighbors around the molecule.

213
00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.160
Okay.
So that's as far as we're going to go.

214
00:14:09.161 --> 00:14:13.420
Looking at the mechanism of the sn two now we're going to look at alternative

215
00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:16.360
paths of reaction.
That elimination reaction,

216
00:14:16.361 --> 00:14:18.310
which we already mentioned last semester,

217
00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:23.640
and also first order nuclear affiliate substitution and elimination first e two

218
00:14:25.361 --> 00:14:30.250
or Beta elimination.
Now we,
this is from last semester.

219
00:14:30.251 --> 00:14:35.140
You remember you can attack here with a high homo anti-bonding here anti-bonding

220
00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:36.610
here you break off fluoride,

221
00:14:36.611 --> 00:14:40.810
you break off hydrogen and formed the carbon carbon bond is shown by the curved

222
00:14:40.811 --> 00:14:45.400
arrows here and we said last semester that that's the two elimination mechanism.

223
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:49.330
Now what influences the rate?

224
00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:55.100
The rate is influenced by the base,
right?
That's what makes it second order.

225
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:59.540
It depends not only on the concentration of the substrate but also on the

226
00:14:59.541 --> 00:15:01.760
concentration of hydroxide.

227
00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:07.060
So the two must be getting together in the rate limiting step or before the rate

228
00:15:07.461 --> 00:15:11.360
limiting step in approval,
luminary equilibrium that God gets drawn off.

229
00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:16.070
So that's the same thinking it was we had on the sn two that both things are

230
00:15:16.071 --> 00:15:19.640
involved in the rate limiting or before the rate limited step.

231
00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.430
It depends on the nature of the leaving group.

232
00:15:22.431 --> 00:15:24.740
A better leaving group reacts faster,

233
00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:29.980
so that means that the fluoride is leaving and the rate limiting step or before

234
00:15:30.711 --> 00:15:34.370
the rate limiting step.
In a pre equilibrium,

235
00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:40.330
there's a hydrogen isotope effect called a kinetic isotope effect.

236
00:15:40.611 --> 00:15:44.630
If you change hydrogen for deuterium,
you change the rate,

237
00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:48.680
and this has,
this has special implication as you can see here.

238
00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:53.930
These others only meant it was at the transition state or before the transition

239
00:15:53.931 --> 00:15:57.620
state that something was happening.
But if this makes a difference,

240
00:15:57.621 --> 00:16:02.270
it shows that that bond is been breaking during the bead broken during the

241
00:16:02.271 --> 00:16:05.450
transition state.
So we know the leaving group is leaving,

242
00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:10.160
we know the base has coming in either before or those two things,

243
00:16:10.161 --> 00:16:12.440
either before or at the transition state.

244
00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:16.640
And now we know the hydrogen is leaving at the transition state and let's see

245
00:16:16.641 --> 00:16:19.070
how that works.
Okay,

246
00:16:19.071 --> 00:16:23.780
so we saw an Arab and meets Goldie locks that you have a of vibrational

247
00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:28.840
potential surface and you'd have also a vibrational potential surface for the

248
00:16:29.241 --> 00:16:31.940
hydrogen that's being transferred after it's transferred.

249
00:16:31.941 --> 00:16:36.680
It stuck first place to the carbon in the second place to the oxygen and in
both,

250
00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:41.780
but it halfway across when the bond is being broken,
it's between the two.

251
00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:45.410
So it's not being bound to either.
It's a very low,

252
00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:49.550
it's easy to move back and forth when it's halfway between.
Okay.

253
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:54.910
Now what implication to this have for the kinetic energy of that hydrogen?

254
00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:58.850
Remember there's a lowest possible kinetic energy,

255
00:16:58.851 --> 00:17:03.320
the one that gives no nodes and the wave and it'll be,
uh,

256
00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:07.130
it'll be here in that case here and the oxygen case.

257
00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:12.310
But when it's very easy to move that you can stretch the wave way out.

258
00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:16.130
Very little curvature,
very little kinetic energy.

259
00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:21.290
So you could have much lower minimum kinetic energy at when the hydrogen bond

260
00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:22.250
has been broken.

261
00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:26.000
That when it's either attached to the carbon or attached to the height,

262
00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:30.020
to the oxygen.
Okay.
Now,
what's the implication of that?

263
00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:33.560
What when you do the reaction,
you have to get to the transition state.

264
00:17:33.561 --> 00:17:38.180
So you have to put in that much energy.
Okay.
Now,

265
00:17:38.181 --> 00:17:42.440
what's the implication if we change from hydrogen to deuterium?

266
00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:51.190
You remember what happens when you have changed the mass in Arabic meets

267
00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.880
goldilocks to the lowest energy.

268
00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.770
If you make the mid to do pterygiums,

269
00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:04.130
then you have a wave that looks like this.

270
00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:08.150
But the bigger mass means it has lower energy.

271
00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:11.673
<v 1>Hi.</v>

272
00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:16.910
<v 0>So we have lower energy here,
lower energy here,
and lower energy here,</v>

273
00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:18.830
but it can't be lower than the minimum.

274
00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.300
So there's hardly any change in the energy here when you go from hydrogen to

275
00:18:23.301 --> 00:18:27.620
deuterium.
But there's a substantial change here and a substantial change here,

276
00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:33.350
right?
So now,
if,
if you look at the energy that's required for the reaction,

277
00:18:33.351 --> 00:18:37.490
it's more energy is required for the deuterium because it started lower.

278
00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:42.050
If you were talking about an equilibrium between here and here,

279
00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.600
then that difference would cancel out.

280
00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:49.490
It's only at that transition state,
which has the very low potential,

281
00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:54.110
right?
That means that there's something special about the deuterium,

282
00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:58.820
or perhaps you should say something not special about the deuterium,
right?

283
00:18:58.821 --> 00:19:03.290
When it's bonded,
it's unusually low in energy,
but when it's not tightly bonded,

284
00:19:03.291 --> 00:19:06.320
then it has the same energy as hydrogen,
right?

285
00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:10.940
So because you have more,
uh,
more of a barrier for deuterium,

286
00:19:10.941 --> 00:19:15.890
the reaction should be slower.
So hydrogen is faster than deuterium.

287
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:19.100
If that is the rate limiting step,

288
00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:23.170
if that's not the rate limiting step,
if it happens,
uh,

289
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:27.050
before this or after this,
right,

290
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:30.080
then you don't have the difference between hydrogen to deuterium.

291
00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:31.670
It's only when the rate,

292
00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:36.140
when the hydrogen is being broke broken away during the transition state,

293
00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:39.590
during the rate determining step that you can see it.
So,

294
00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:44.720
so you get that difference in rates only that so-called kinetic isotope effect

295
00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:49.430
only if bond is being weakened in the rate determining transition state.

296
00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:50.661
Okay.

297
00:19:50.661 --> 00:19:55.640
So now there's another interesting implication as there was an sn two,

298
00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:57.860
which is stereochemistry.

299
00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:02.540
So we have a hydrogen and a leaving group that are going to come off,
right?

300
00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:05.360
And if we look at that from the end with the Newman projection,

301
00:20:05.361 --> 00:20:07.040
we see them Auntie to one another.

302
00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:11.510
So we can imagine pulling the two off and forming a bond by what's left.

303
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:16.400
They could have been sin to one another in an eclipsed confirmation now,

304
00:20:16.401 --> 00:20:17.600
which should be better.

305
00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:22.640
Should we pull them off anti to one another or sin to one another?

306
00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:28.540
Well,
of course the,
the top con formation would in,
in,
uh,

307
00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:31.190
involve eclipsing,
right?

308
00:20:31.191 --> 00:20:35.420
So that would be higher in energy than the ante.
And furthermore,

309
00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.840
it turns out,
although we don't have time to talk about it right now,

310
00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:44.050
that anti orbitals overlap with one another better than sin or bottles,

311
00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:47.170
which seems to me that seems counterintuitive.

312
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:48.640
You'd think though they are like this,

313
00:20:48.641 --> 00:20:50.530
they'd overlap better than when they're like that,

314
00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:55.180
but in fact they overlap better when their auntie.
So by both accounts,

315
00:20:55.181 --> 00:21:00.100
one would expect,
uh,
the ante to be the preferred mode for,

316
00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:05.440
for elimination.
But is it true?
How could you test that experimentally?

317
00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.740
How could you tell whether they were being,

318
00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:12.430
they had been pulled off or we're being pulled off from the same side or from

319
00:21:12.431 --> 00:21:17.270
opposite sides?
Well,

320
00:21:17.271 --> 00:21:20.300
if you look at the title of this slide,
you use stereo chemistry.

321
00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:22.803
<v 1>Okay.</v>

322
00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:26.850
<v 0>Okay.
So notice then,</v>

323
00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.170
<v 1>uh,
what's happening here?</v>

324
00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:36.470
<v 0>There we go.
That if we put our groups on here,</v>

325
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:41.300
right?
Then when we lose h and l here,
these two,

326
00:21:41.301 --> 00:21:45.380
ours will be on the same side,
but if it's rotated into this form,

327
00:21:45.381 --> 00:21:48.860
then there'll be on opposite sides of the new double bond that's being made

328
00:21:48.861 --> 00:21:50.630
across the middle.
Right?

329
00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:56.200
So we could start for sin elimination of this particular compound where notice

330
00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:01.400
this configuration is s and that went also his ass and it's rotated into a

331
00:22:02.211 --> 00:22:06.620
confirmation where the leaving groups or sin to one another.
Okay.

332
00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:11.150
Now of course it could rotate and they could be anti to one another and the

333
00:22:11.151 --> 00:22:14.930
question is which one really happens?
Okay.

334
00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:20.290
So we can look at the product and find that the two methyls are on the same side

335
00:22:20.451 --> 00:22:23.720
of the double bond as they are here,
both in back.

336
00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:27.290
Whereas here one's in front of the other is in back.
Right.

337
00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:32.510
So this suggests that the fact of that one gets the isomer of the,

338
00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:37.540
of the owl keen that it was the anti form that gave rise to it.

339
00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:42.350
So stereochemistry showed that it's anti elimination in this case.

340
00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:46.010
Of course,
there could have been another reason for anti elimination.

341
00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:50.930
It could have been that this product is more stable than the one where the

342
00:22:50.931 --> 00:22:54.830
federal group is near the methyl,
right?

343
00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:59.840
So how can we discriminate whether it's just that it's the preferred

344
00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:03.380
confirmation and Auntie is good for the reasons shown here,

345
00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:07.070
or whether the only reason you get that one is because it's more stable.

346
00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:09.320
Can anybody see how you can test that?

347
00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:19.970
You could use a different stereo chemistry of the starting material and see if

348
00:23:19.971 --> 00:23:22.340
it still gives that one.
Okay.

349
00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:27.680
So maybe he is just more stable than the Z isomer.
Okay.

350
00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:32.390
So here we can change the configuration on the right to make it are right.

351
00:23:32.391 --> 00:23:36.500
The methyl is now in back and the hydrogen in front here,
right?

352
00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:41.770
So now the sin is the one that should give the isomer and the Auntie should give

353
00:23:43.221 --> 00:23:47.990
the Z.
Right?
And in fact,
you see it is Izzy.

354
00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:50.180
So no matter which way,

355
00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:55.460
it can't be just because this one is more stable,
because if you change it,

356
00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:57.410
you've got that one,
right?

357
00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:02.740
So it has to be that it favors the ante con formation for the elimination.

358
00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:08.600
Okay,
so there's Auntie stereochemistry,
right?

359
00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:12.980
But nature is not dogmatic about this.
If there's,

360
00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:17.930
if you can't do the,
the uh,
anti,
then the sin is,
is a,

361
00:24:17.931 --> 00:24:21.500
is still okay.
And here's an example of that,
uh,

362
00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:26.660
taken from the Jones Textbook.
Uh,
notice that in this case,

363
00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:31.880
the treatment with base to eliminate hydrogen or deterioration from this side

364
00:24:31.881 --> 00:24:36.881
and tousled each from that side removes the deuterium leaving two hydrogens and

365
00:24:37.851 --> 00:24:41.210
gives that a 98% yield.
Even those two,

366
00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:45.980
even though those two are required to be sin to one another,
because again,

367
00:24:45.981 --> 00:24:50.240
this by cyclic framework,
the say one used by Bartlett and knocks,

368
00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:55.300
that idea of holding things in place that way doesn't require,

369
00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:58.490
doesn't allow confirmational change around here.

370
00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:01.790
So these have to be sin to one another,
right?

371
00:25:01.791 --> 00:25:03.890
So it loses d ots,

372
00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:08.270
not h o t s despite the kinetic isotope of factor.
Remember,

373
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:13.070
hydrogen is eliminated and preference to do Tyrian other things being equal,

374
00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:16.400
but other things are equal as you can look here.

375
00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:20.240
If you do a sort of semi Newman projection along this bond,

376
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:25.430
you can see that d and Ots,
their bonds are in the same plane.

377
00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:30.620
So in this rigid eclipsed case,
the overlap of Sigma Star here,

378
00:25:30.621 --> 00:25:34.070
which is losing its electrons,
right?
Uh,

379
00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:36.680
that is as the ots minus leaves,

380
00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:41.390
this vacant orbital is able to overlap well and stabilize the sigma orbitals and

381
00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:45.830
in this,
uh,
bond.
So it takes away those electrons and deep plus leaves.

382
00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:50.140
So the Eclipse d is better than age,

383
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:53.090
which would would be better if it could be anti,

384
00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:55.970
but this framework doesn't allow it to be anti.

385
00:25:55.970 --> 00:26:00.200
There's not good overlap between the h and the ots.
It's anticline UL.

386
00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:05.690
And notice in this case that you don't have to pay a penalty for having the

387
00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:09.050
starting material for the sin elimination eclipsed.

388
00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:14.240
It's required to be eclipsed by the nature of the linkage among the carbons.

389
00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:19.310
Okay.
Now there's,
that's a question of Stereo Chemistry,

390
00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:23.420
whether you get E or z Isomer,
right?

391
00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:26.630
There's also a question of what's called Riggio Chemistry.

392
00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:28.820
Where does the double bond appear?

393
00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:32.990
So if the leaving group is here on the second carbon and you treat it with base

394
00:26:32.991 --> 00:26:35.160
to remove h and l,
uh,

395
00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:39.770
then you can get the double bond either in this position or in this position,

396
00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:42.770
right?
And that that one can both be both CIS and trans.

397
00:26:42.771 --> 00:26:46.830
I draw only the Trans isomer right now.

398
00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:50.550
So you could remove a blue hydrogen or red hydrogen.
Right?

399
00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:55.140
And this is the kind of thing where before people knew anything about mechanism,

400
00:26:55.500 --> 00:27:00.500
people tried to figure out how you can get a certain product and these at

401
00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:05.010
different pathways,
this was just lore,
right?
This would do this,

402
00:27:05.011 --> 00:27:08.280
this would do this.
And there were two kinds of rules.

403
00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:13.200
One was the rule do to Hoffman,
the other was the rule do to site sef,

404
00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:16.860
right?
So there was the site's f rule,

405
00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:21.840
which said you should take off the blue hydrogen and there was the Hoffman rule

406
00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:25.170
that you should take off the red hydrogen.
Okay.

407
00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:28.830
And some cases did one and some cases did the other.

408
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:32.150
And it was your business if you are a synthetic chemist,

409
00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:33.780
to know which ones did which.

410
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:37.800
So you had no what kind of leaving group to choose or what kind of bass to

411
00:27:37.801 --> 00:27:42.801
choose to do your particular to get the particular product you are desirous of.

412
00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:47.820
So if you have the leaving group of the halogen,
Ziad and bromine,
chlorine,

413
00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.470
you see their site,
Seth,

414
00:27:49.471 --> 00:27:54.030
the dominant Ice Library you get is in the second position,

415
00:27:54.031 --> 00:27:58.560
not the terminal position,
right?
But notice as we go,
I had and bromine,

416
00:27:58.561 --> 00:28:03.270
chlorine and it gets less and less sites.
F and in fact,
if you go to flu ride,

417
00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:07.890
it turns around and it becomes Hoffman and its orientation.
Right?

418
00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:12.150
And the same is true for the leaving group being uh,

419
00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:13.460
trimethylamine.

420
00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:18.180
So the trimethyl ammonium starting material loses that this,
uh,

421
00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:22.840
this,
uh,
uh,
trimethylamine and,
and uh,

422
00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:27.420
and this proton.
So it's 98% of Hoffman orientation.

423
00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.190
So,
uh,

424
00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:34.220
so this big group seems to be Hoffman a iodide seems to be sites f but look,

425
00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:39.750
let's look a little bit about the energetics that are involved here.
Okay.

426
00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:43.890
So this is a ratio of about four to one.
This is about one to 50.

427
00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.510
So the whole range,
which is very important,

428
00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:50.010
which what you're going to be getting,
uh,

429
00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:54.540
is only a factor of 200 between four to one and one to 50.

430
00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:58.230
So 400 means a factor of 10 to the 2.3,

431
00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:04.040
which means that it's about three kilocalories change and energy that makes it

432
00:29:04.141 --> 00:29:08.820
from going four to one,
one way to 50 to one the other way,

433
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.890
a change of just three kilocalories.

434
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:16.190
And remember that a hydrogen bond is not a particularly strong hydrogen bond is

435
00:29:17.011 --> 00:29:18.420
worth three kilocalories.

436
00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:23.160
So you can see that subtle things are going to enter into this,
not it's,
it's,

437
00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:28.210
it's not surprising that there are not a hard and fast rules that sometimes that

438
00:29:28.921 --> 00:29:31.260
sites sef and sometimes it's,
uh,

439
00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:34.590
it's Hoffman because this is a very subtle thing.

440
00:29:34.591 --> 00:29:37.850
It's important for synthesis,
but it does,

441
00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:41.800
but it's not a big factor that you could be confident that you put your finger

442
00:29:41.801 --> 00:29:45.450
on it and say,
that's the reason that went that way.
Okay,

443
00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:50.460
now you can have e two versus asset too.

444
00:29:50.461 --> 00:29:55.230
You can have the High Hobo come in,
either attack a carbon or take a hydrogen.

445
00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:59.850
How well do we understand which,
what,
what does that,
well,

446
00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:02.550
suppose we take ti Butyl,
uh,

447
00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:06.990
w to do an sn.
Two reaction you'd have to attack there,

448
00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:10.950
but we've seen this picture before and you know that that sterically hindered,

449
00:30:10.951 --> 00:30:12.000
you can't get in there.

450
00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:17.300
So steric hindrance tends to favor to disfavor sn two pro processes,

451
00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:24.290
but it's much easier to get to the neighboring hydrogen and pull it off.

452
00:30:24.721 --> 00:30:26.550
It's on the surface of the molecule.

453
00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:31.200
So steric hindrance favors he too over sn two.

454
00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:35.880
It doesn't by disfavor in sn two.
So if you have very hindered center,

455
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.950
you tend to get elimination,
not substitution.
Right.
That makes perfect sense.

456
00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:42.530
And furthermore,

457
00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:46.720
remember when we looked at nucleo Felicity and tried to how,

458
00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:49.680
how good things are at attacking carbon,
we,

459
00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:53.790
we tried to see whether it would be the same as attacking hydrogen and there

460
00:30:53.791 --> 00:30:55.950
wasn't such good parallelisms.

461
00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:01.160
Some things were more dramatic in their PKA in attacking hydrogen than they were

462
00:31:02.161 --> 00:31:04.920
in attacking carbon.
So that,

463
00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:09.950
that obviously means that if you take something that's a fairly weak nucleophile

464
00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:13.950
compared to how basic it is,
right?
The PKA though,

465
00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:16.950
if you look at those which are grossly out of whack,

466
00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:20.310
then they could be ones that would,
that would,
uh,
prefer that,

467
00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:24.720
the attack and the hydrogen.
So for example,
hydroxide is of that case.

468
00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:29.700
It's a strong base but not as good a nucleophile as you would expect for such a

469
00:31:29.701 --> 00:31:30.534
strong base.

470
00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:35.720
So hydroxide or alk dockside tends to do elimination rather than substitution.

471
00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:40.560
But always these are a balancing act and it could depend on other factors as

472
00:31:40.561 --> 00:31:41.394
well.

473
00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:43.533
<v 1>Now</v>

474
00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:51.690
<v 0>I've given the title to these next things a synthesis games because,</v>

475
00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:56.440
uh,
synthesis is,
is for many people,

476
00:31:56.441 --> 00:32:01.441
the real goal of organic chemistry is how to make new molecules or to make old

477
00:32:01.781 --> 00:32:06.220
molecules and better ways.
And there are certain,
uh,

478
00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:11.530
uh,
one of the best ways is to follow lore,

479
00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:16.090
right?
But we,
but it's also guided by understanding and there've been big,

480
00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:17.363
uh,

481
00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:22.980
lots of progress made in the last 50 years because of people having studied

482
00:32:23.291 --> 00:32:25.630
mechanism that if something isn't going right,

483
00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.600
you have some idea what you might change in order to make it,

484
00:32:28.601 --> 00:32:30.430
not just looking up in the,

485
00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:33.970
in the literature to see what people did before.

486
00:32:33.971 --> 00:32:36.790
Although that remains a very important procedure.

487
00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:41.510
But we saw all these different nuclear fillic a substitution reactions.

488
00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:42.710
And the question then,

489
00:32:42.711 --> 00:32:46.970
if you're trying to apply somebody else's work to yours is how general they are.

490
00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:52.280
For example,
the Williamson ether synthesis,
how general is it?
So for example,

491
00:32:52.281 --> 00:32:55.640
here's the compound Mtb e,
have you ever heard of that?

492
00:32:56.450 --> 00:33:01.400
I bet you've seen the word
or the acronym.

493
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:03.740
It's methyl t butyl ether.

494
00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:08.510
Have you ever seen MTBE where did you see it?

495
00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:15.110
On the gasoline pump,
right?
This is an additive to,
to,
to tig gasoline.

496
00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:19.070
So it's made in enormous quantities right now.

497
00:33:19.071 --> 00:33:22.910
So here you want to make this ether.
Okay,
so here's the way to do it.

498
00:33:22.911 --> 00:33:27.470
You could start with methanol,
treat it with sodium hydride.

499
00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:32.650
So there is a high hobo which can attack the Proton and take it away as h two

500
00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:36.800
leaving the sodium,
salt of meth oxides.
So we have a nuclear file.

501
00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:39.710
Now if we want to make this bond here,

502
00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:42.440
the one between the oxygen or the tertiary carbon,

503
00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:46.580
then we would react it with tea.
Beautiful Bromide.
Right?

504
00:33:46.581 --> 00:33:50.750
Are you going to get rich in the petroleum industry making Tbe that way?

505
00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:53.210
Are there any problems?

506
00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:06.640
What did we just been talking about?

507
00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:13.180
The competition between substitution and the elimination.

508
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:18.690
Right?
And what are the factors that favor he two over sn.

509
00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:22.930
Two Amy steric hindrance,
right?

510
00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:27.490
Crowded here.
It's hard for this option to get out the carbon.
And what else

511
00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:33.210
did,
if you have an I have an eye on right,
or a nuclear file,

512
00:34:33.211 --> 00:34:35.910
that's even better as a base taking hydrogen.

513
00:34:36.450 --> 00:34:38.880
So here we have the worst of all possible worlds.

514
00:34:38.881 --> 00:34:42.210
We have something that wants to take hydrogen and something that wasn't,

515
00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:46.740
doesn't want to be attacked at the carbon,
right?
So you get elimination.

516
00:34:46.741 --> 00:34:50.760
It's too hindered for sn two and the strong base favors he too.

517
00:34:50.970 --> 00:34:54.760
So all you get is,
is,
uh,
is the,
uh,
the,
uh,

518
00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:57.780
double bond compound.
You don't get methyl TV.
It'll ether.

519
00:34:58.470 --> 00:35:01.890
So does the Williams since synthesis then not work,

520
00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:05.310
you just throw up your hands if you're a synthetic chemist.

521
00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:09.750
We said we wanted to make,

522
00:35:09.751 --> 00:35:13.500
to make Mtbe we wanted to make that oxygen carbon bond.

523
00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:15.930
Can you see any alternative?

524
00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:18.070
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

525
00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:20.020
<v 0>Do you use to make this either</v>

526
00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:29.110
you could make that oxygen carbon bond.
Okay.

527
00:35:29.111 --> 00:35:33.070
There's more than one way to skin this kind of cat.
Okay.

528
00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:35.770
So that one won't work.
Right?

529
00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:40.530
But if we do it the other way around and make this an ion right,

530
00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:45.660
which again would prefer to eliminate rather than substitute.
Right?

531
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:48.720
But you attack methyl bromide,

532
00:35:48.721 --> 00:35:52.440
which can't eliminate because it doesn't have a hydrogen on the other carbon

533
00:35:52.441 --> 00:35:55.370
because it doesn't have another carbon.
Right?

534
00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:58.170
So now you get the MTBE and high yield,

535
00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.780
although nobody makes it that way.

536
00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:04.140
The stuff that's made for petroleum has made a different way.

537
00:36:04.141 --> 00:36:07.350
And we'll talk about that a little later on.
But anyhow,

538
00:36:07.351 --> 00:36:11.220
this illustrates that often there are different ways of choosing,

539
00:36:11.221 --> 00:36:15.570
putting the reagents together and one will work and one won't work for reasons

540
00:36:15.571 --> 00:36:20.310
that you can understand mechanistically.
Or here's another interesting,

541
00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:21.990
uh,
synthetic intermediate,

542
00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:27.650
which is if you start with a compound that is o h and chlorine on adjacent

543
00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:32.700
Adams,
and notice it has one in the front and one in the back,

544
00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:37.080
right?
And you treat this with base,
right?

545
00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:41.670
It gives this funny ether at ether.
That's a three membered ring,

546
00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:46.800
right?
And it does.
So in pretty good yield,
right?
How does it do it?

547
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:50.010
Well,
hydroxide takes off this proton

548
00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:53.250
and can you see what happens next?

549
00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:03.560
It's a reaction that's familiar to you.

550
00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:06.853
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

551
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:08.840
<v 0>We want to make this bond.</v>

552
00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:12.710
How do we make that second box,

553
00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.590
the new bond and the three membered ring?

554
00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:20.960
It's an sn two reaction,
right?

555
00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:26.030
This hobo attacks sigma star backside,

556
00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:32.980
so it's an in trob molecular sn two reaction and chloride leaves degenerate.

557
00:37:34.901 --> 00:37:36.470
Generate this three membered ring,

558
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:40.640
the three membered ether is called sometimes at Parkside,

559
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:45.650
sometimes oxirane.
Some people call it one,
some call at the other.

560
00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:49.780
And in fact,
ETP oxides,
uh,

561
00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:54.560
are very useful synthetic intermediates because,

562
00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:58.940
uh,
that,
uh,
although aro minus is,

563
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.850
is a crummy leaving group,
right?

564
00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:06.530
In this case it's helped by losing the ring strain.
So you,

565
00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:11.240
it's spring loaded to open up,
right?
So you can,
so you can,
uh,

566
00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:15.380
you say you can attack here with some nucleophile break the bond.

567
00:38:15.381 --> 00:38:20.381
The old binus comes away and this gives away of adding CCO to a nucleophile.

568
00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:27.760
So you bring some nucleophile in and it adds to the nucleophile two carbons and

569
00:38:28.011 --> 00:38:32.600
then an oxygen.
So synthetic chemists often think,
what is it?

570
00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:35.470
If I,
if I want to get this product,

571
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:40.720
that's something plus CCO,
how could I do that?

572
00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:44.890
Ethylene oxide,
right?
That epoxide can do it.

573
00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:46.691
And in fact,

574
00:38:46.691 --> 00:38:50.350
we're going to talk more about that as a synthetic intermediate later.

575
00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:55.420
For example,
that's the stuff from which you make a crown.
Ethers does,

576
00:38:55.421 --> 00:38:58.870
it has,
remember at CCO,
see COO CCO,

577
00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:03.130
but we'll talk about that a few lectures further on now.

578
00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:08.490
First synthetic purposes of particularly useful set of nuclear files is cyanide.

579
00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:10.830
A satellite,

580
00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:16.030
the thing you get by losing proton from a settled lead and this other type of

581
00:39:16.031 --> 00:39:20.560
anti which has an Alpha,
uh,
an Alpha and I,

582
00:39:20.561 --> 00:39:23.160
and it's lost the proton adjacent to carbon units.

583
00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:25.270
We talked about that one before.

584
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:30.250
And the reason these are interesting is because they are nuclear files that form

585
00:39:30.251 --> 00:39:35.110
carbon carbon bonds.
Most of the things we talked about,
uh,

586
00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:40.180
replace one functional group by another alleving group goes away.

587
00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:41.410
The new one comes in,

588
00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:46.450
the new one is typically some something like oxygen or nitrogen,
right?

589
00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:51.780
But these anti ions have carbon coming in and that means you make a new carbon

590
00:39:52.721 --> 00:39:53.421
skeleton.

591
00:39:53.421 --> 00:39:57.760
So that's something that's very important in putting together a organic

592
00:39:57.761 --> 00:39:59.950
molecules.
Now notice that this,

593
00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:03.400
that these two both have a PK of nine.

594
00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:08.560
So you put the starting material that is the protonated forums have a PK of
nine.

595
00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:13.120
So you put them in with Bass and you get the anti and it does its trick,
right?

596
00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:16.480
But a satellite is PK of 25,

597
00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:18.910
so you can't use that in water.

598
00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:22.120
It would immediately take the proton away from water,
right?

599
00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:27.120
So it's a base and it actually tends to do elimination sometimes rather than

600
00:40:27.701 --> 00:40:29.530
substitution,
right?

601
00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:33.820
So you need a stronger base if you want to pull off a proton and do that.

602
00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:36.970
So you can do it with sodium amid.

603
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:42.510
Notice that this is the anti and coming from Nh three is the acid and Nh three.

604
00:40:43.001 --> 00:40:47.080
Then as the product after it's pulled off this proton,
and it is a much,

605
00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:50.380
a much stronger base,
a much weaker acid,

606
00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:54.910
but nine powers of 10 than the acetyl ideas.
So you can make it that way.

607
00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:58.810
So these could be important in synthesis and we'll see later on in the course

608
00:40:58.811 --> 00:41:00.520
how very important,
uh,

609
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:04.300
nuclear files that are carbon are in putting molecules together.

610
00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:10.380
Now if we look at the rate of the reaction of sodium hydroxide with an

611
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:15.280
[inaudible] bromide for different r groups,
and look at the,

612
00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:18.430
uh,
we're going to look at in a log scale.

613
00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:20.920
So we can cover five powers of 10 and the rate,

614
00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:26.520
and it's how much of our br gets converted to Hor per minute.

615
00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:31.150
Okay?
And we're going to do it in ethanol water,

616
00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:33.280
four to one at 55 degrees.

617
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:39.370
And we see a 1% about 10 to the minus two is of,

618
00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:42.260
of,
of uh,
of uh,

619
00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:47.320
methyl bromide is converted to this ether our apartment until the alcohol per

620
00:41:48.201 --> 00:41:52.160
minute.
1% per minute,
right?
If we make it,

621
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:57.350
uh,
ethyl bromide,
it's only a 10th of a percent per,

622
00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:02.000
uh,
per minute.
Right?
What would you expect for ice approval?

623
00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:06.860
Right?
Looks good.
What do you expect for t butyl?

624
00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:13.120
So there's something funny.

625
00:42:13.121 --> 00:42:17.530
Something has changed where we went from Methyl Ethyl Eissa propyl butyl

626
00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:19.183
<v 1>right</v>

627
00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:21.991
<v 0>now.</v>

628
00:42:21.991 --> 00:42:26.850
This was done with 0.01 molar sodium hydroxide getting these rates.

629
00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:31.890
But it turns out that the rate of these depends on how much hydroxide there is.

630
00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:33.990
That doesn't surprise you.
It's sn two.

631
00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:39.240
Depends on how much of the nuclear file their eyes,
right?
Uh,
and in fact,

632
00:42:39.241 --> 00:42:42.720
if you look at the,
at the second order rate constant,

633
00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:46.590
which takes into account the concentration of base,

634
00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:51.870
then you'll see these fall on a nice curve and it slowed down by crowding the

635
00:42:51.871 --> 00:42:55.860
steric hindrance that we talked about before.
But you'd expect t beautiful,

636
00:42:55.861 --> 00:43:00.300
they'll be down here someplace.
In fact,
it's up there.
Right?

637
00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:04.740
And that's because that one is not dependent on hydroxide,

638
00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:08.140
right?
It's not sn two.
It doesn't,

639
00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:12.420
the rate doesn't depend both on how lied and the hydroxide.

640
00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:15.870
It depends only on the Halide,
right?

641
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:20.100
So at the rate determining step,
the base hasn't gotten involved yet.

642
00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:25.710
Right?
So,
and notice that it's accelerated by crowding.

643
00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:30.360
When you get to the most crowded one,
that mechanism goes really fast,
right?

644
00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:33.210
It,
it happens by a,

645
00:43:33.211 --> 00:43:38.211
and it could happen because the cad ion is more stable when it's more

646
00:43:38.881 --> 00:43:43.410
substituted,
right?
It's also accelerated by a polar solvent.

647
00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:48.600
If you try a solvent that stock polar,
it's harder to make ions in it,
right?

648
00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:53.220
But the ethanol and water is,
is a reasonably polar solvent.

649
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:59.390
So this is the sn one reaction as opposed to sn two and this a categorization

650
00:44:01.711 --> 00:44:06.711
was was a formulated sn one sn two in England and in London and uh,

651
00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:10.380
in the 1930s by Hughes,
an end goal.

652
00:44:11.850 --> 00:44:15.210
That rate actually wasn't measured at that temperature.

653
00:44:15.211 --> 00:44:18.240
They've measured at a lower temperature and figured out what it would be at this

654
00:44:18.241 --> 00:44:19.770
temperature.
Okay.

655
00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:23.280
This is how much is converted to Hor,

656
00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:27.050
but some of the starting material is not converted to Hor.

657
00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:31.950
Some of it undergoes elimination.
So at this stage,

658
00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:33.720
19%,

659
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:38.990
so about one fifth of the product is in fact the elimination product,

660
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:42.420
e to the base of tax,
the adjacent hydrogen,

661
00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:44.790
rather than waiting for it to ionize.

662
00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:50.480
And we know it's e two because the amount you get depends on how much hydroxide

663
00:44:50.701 --> 00:44:54.930
you put in there,
the amount,
the rate of forming the alcohol,

664
00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:59.160
the rate of the substitution doesn't depend on the hydroxide,

665
00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:03.390
but the rate of farming the alkene does depend on the hydroxide.

666
00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:04.770
So you change the rate,

667
00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:08.550
the ratio of the products by changing the hydroxide concentration.

668
00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:14.130
So now you can have sn one and d one as well.

669
00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:17.430
Now in that case,
in the case we just talked about,

670
00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:22.260
if you put more hydroxide in the starting material goes away more rapidly,

671
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:27.090
right?
Because that the elimination is dependent on hydroxide.

672
00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:31.500
But in the case here where it's cyanide that's doing,
that's the High Hobo,

673
00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:32.760
it's doing the attacking.

674
00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:36.390
You find that you get not only the cyanide substitution,

675
00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:40.920
but you also get substitution by water.
Right?

676
00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:47.490
Now,
this the product ratio depends on how much cyanide you put in.

677
00:45:47.530 --> 00:45:49.860
That doesn't surprise you.
You put in more cyanide.

678
00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:53.220
The formation of this product is faster,
right?

679
00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:55.530
But the rate doesn't change.

680
00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:02.690
The rate of destroying the starting with Daryl doesn't change when you do this.

681
00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:05.900
Can everybody see how that could be?

682
00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:10.400
How could you change the products but not change the rate?

683
00:46:15.830 --> 00:46:16.663
<v 1>Matt,</v>

684
00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:29.760
<v 0>let's try it here.
So we have this starting material and these two products.</v>

685
00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:31.440
So we're going to draw a reaction,

686
00:46:31.441 --> 00:46:35.580
coordinate diagram to get from the starting material to other products.
Okay.

687
00:46:35.581 --> 00:46:39.670
Here we formed as an sn one intermediate cad I on.

688
00:46:40.290 --> 00:46:42.360
All right?
And then it goes on.

689
00:46:42.450 --> 00:46:47.040
If there's cyanide around to give that product or with water to give that

690
00:46:47.041 --> 00:46:50.970
product.
Well,
what determines the rate of the process?

691
00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:56.160
What's the rate determining step?
The Red One,
right?

692
00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:59.580
That happens before you decide which product you'll get.

693
00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:04.200
Now if you have more cyanide in there,
more of it,
we'll go this way,

694
00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:05.581
right?

695
00:47:05.581 --> 00:47:10.581
So you can change the products without changing the rate if you have this cat

696
00:47:11.621 --> 00:47:12.570
high and intermediate.

697
00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:17.430
So if the product is determine after the rate by competition for the short lived

698
00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:21.090
and I cad I am.
So that's evidence that you have a cat.

699
00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:23.610
I ended RBD yet in this substitution.

700
00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:26.590
Now here's a,
uh,

701
00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:31.330
silver nitrate helping to pull off the levy group,
uh,
iodide.

702
00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:35.230
But notice what's funny in this case.
Whoops.

703
00:47:35.530 --> 00:47:39.940
What's funny is I've talked my head off here.
Okay.
So,
um,

704
00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:44.560
there are a few more slides that I think it would be helpful to have to make
the,

705
00:47:44.561 --> 00:47:48.310
uh,
the exam,
uh,
coherent.

706
00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:51.040
So since the exams are going to be on Friday,

707
00:47:51.041 --> 00:47:53.760
why don't we put a few more of one to the next than,

708
00:47:53.761 --> 00:47:56.110
I apologize and let you go now.

709
00:47:56.470 --> 00:48:00.550
So we'll do a few more slides next time and then kind of for the exam,

710
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.520
and there'll be a review session on Wednesday.
