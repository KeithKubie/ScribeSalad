00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:06.820
This right over here is a, I guess you could say it's a

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.820
Side view of a human brain and I probably don't have to tell you that the brain is a

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.820
fascinating organ

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.139
It's what makes you you and me me everything that you are I

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.060
Think about, that

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.510
we're doing, we're seeing it's really all occurring in the brain. Even this

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.459
reality that you see around you, that you think is external to your brain. It's really a

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:34.558
simulation that your brain constructs for itself based on sensory input from the outside world, and so you could imagine is this incredibly

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.200
complex and you could even say

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:44.849
mysterious organ. And even though we don't understand everything about how the human brain works and I could imagine we will be exploring

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.750
how the brain works and learning more about it for decades if not centuries

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.889
to come there are things that we do know about the human brain.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.840
We do know for example that it's made of it's made up of the estimates

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.529
I've seen of anywhere, or is roughly 80 to 100

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:04.079
billion -- let me write that in caps

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.890
billion

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.119
billion neurons and neurons are

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.890
the cells that

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.250
essentially do all of the

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:19.499
processing of our brain so this right over here is a is a if you were to kind of really

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.869
zoom in on the brain on a very, very small level. This right over here is a

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.409
blow-up of what a neuron looks like. There are other Khan Academy videos that go in much more depth on the anatomy of a neuron

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.899
and the functions of a neuron, but you see here that you have a you you have

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.299
it's a cell with a nucleus

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.629
just like other cells and what it does is essentially it receives input it receives signals from other neurons

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.879
and then when it's stimulated accordingly

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.180
it'll send signals to other neurons and this

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.390
stimulation and inhibition and sending signals from one neuron to another and through kind of chemic

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:05.040
chemoelectrical signals this is the stuff of our thoughts. Our thoughts are these these continuous

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.670
stimulations and inhibitions from one neuron to

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.429
another from one neuron to another neuron

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.260
It's not you know when when you're thinking a thought or you're looking at a dog or you're trying to solve an algebra problem,

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.269
it's not just one or two neurons that are firing; we're talking on the order of of

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.660
thousands or millions or maybe even billions of neurons firing and you have kind of these

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.739
impulses that are traveling through your brain depending on the connections that you're forming, the associations that you're

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.259
forming in the concept that you're looking at and these connections usually I'd say hey 80 to 100 billion

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.920
that's a huge number that's on the order of the number of stars in a Milky Way sized galaxy. That's an

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:55.049
unimaginably large number but to kind of blow your mind even more in the human brain in the human brain

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.160
there are

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.160
approximately 100

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.450
trillion

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.450
trillion synapses

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.470
synapses, and another way to think about them is -- let me write synapses

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.069
synapses or another way to think about these are kind of the connections between

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.940
these hundred billion neurons or these 80 to 100 billion neurons

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:22.199
So you're thinking each neuron roughly has a thousand connections to other neurons so it's an incredibly incredibly complex thing

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:29.100
So one question that you might say it's okay. Well, how do neurons relate to something

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.390
like

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.130
intelligence? Your ability to solve a problem or to

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.949
reason through things and what we do know if you look at the animal kingdom

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.569
is that the amount of neurons and the level of connections between the neurons is a

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:52.319
reasonable indicator if you go from species to species for intelligence, so for example?

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.370
jellyfish

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.630
jellyfish

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.519
Have eight hundred

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.519
eight hundred neurons

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.399
while human beings have eighty to a hundred

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.760
billion neurons

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:10.560
That human beings are kind of at the at the top of the food chain at least when it comes to how many neurons there

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.359
Are and the number of synapses, etcetera, kind of go with that.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.820
But what about within a species, is intelligence something

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.099
intelligence that is something that is fixed are you just kind of born with a certain number of neurons?

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.940
And a certain number of connections between them

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:35.320
Or is it or is it something that can somehow change over time because of the environment that you're in? And this is the interesting

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.790
thing and this is something that I am I'm always thinking about it, and it's fascinating and I always think about it whenever I'm

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.169
Alone I'm thinking about things around what I'm trying to tackle a new subject

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:49.120
Is that there's actually a lot of research here on the fact that you can change?

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:57.159
you can change the structures in your brain through training the structures in your brain, so you can change it, so

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.580
This is this is changeable

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.520
Changeable or maybe ourselves

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.559
You can change it can

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.760
you can

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:13.330
change your intelligence based on essentially training your brain. And

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.840
the analogy that you can have here and you know you could say it's a metaphor

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.959
But in some ways it's a very direct metaphor

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.300
We all know that you can train your muscles; that if you lift weights if you strain your muscles

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.130
that then your muscle kind of

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.809
Your body recognizes that it needs to be stronger in that part of your body

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.929
And it will build that part of bodies as more you strain it the more

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.330
You stress it you give it a little time for repair

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.330
And then your muscle will come back stronger

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:45.189
And what a lot of the researchers have found over the last few decades is this is also true of the brain. You

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:52.929
see it as a child develops. This is some imagery that I got from Mindset Works

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:58.030
this is a site run by Carol Dweck was one of the researchers who really thinks about how the

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:05.770
How when you struggle, and when you try to tackle things more how that affects your ability to actually process it

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:12.939
actually affects your intelligence and what this imagery right over here is this is a an image of a

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:21.840
Child's I guess you could say neuron density or the synapsel

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.090
and the word density at birth, and we see that as a child learns languages,

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:32.769
they explore the world around them, as they struggle as a persevere as they try to emulate those around them, their brain actually gets

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:38.319
denser the more that a child uses tries to kind of form connections

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:45.109
Struggle stresses their brain the connections between the neurons become more numerous you see that here and they can also become

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:50.718
stronger so you might you actually might have a a once again more connections form and

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:56.960
They can become more active and when you think about the brain as you know when you have a thought

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.449
It's all of these associations between these different neurons

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:04.429
and they're all firing and stimulating each other what when you build those new connections is those new

00:07:04.619 --> 00:07:11.299
Associations and a lot or those those new synapses it allows you to form new communication in your brain you new associations

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:16.639
It'll essentially allow you to think faster and better and to reason in ways that you couldn't have done before

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:18.199
And you might say okay?

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:20.359
Well that just happens from you know child to birth

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.719
but what about later on in life is this something that I can change now if I'm

00:07:23.849 --> 00:07:28.878
10 years old or 20 years old or 50 years old and all the research says. Yes

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:32.058
You absolutely can and the key is how do you stimulate?

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:37.188
your brain just as someone of any age can stimulate their body and

00:07:37.379 --> 00:07:40.549
Allow their muscles to grow by lifting weights by stressing them

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:47.359
There's been there been many studies that have shown it for example in animals that if you have an animal living in an unstated

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:51.529
Environment you actually don't have that many connections form you don't have that much much

00:07:53.219 --> 00:08:00.799
Density of the Brain especially the synapse density but but then if you have an animal that's in a stimulating environment an environment that's constantly

00:08:00.959 --> 00:08:08.509
challenging an environment where it's interacting with each others, and it's solving problems, then you actually have a higher density of of

00:08:09.839 --> 00:08:17.419
Neural connections you have you essentially the animal has become smarter so what I find really interesting about this and I always

00:08:17.789 --> 00:08:23.239
Remembered in my brain is it's very easy. You know a lot of us it's it's tempting to say okay?

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:27.169
I got what I got that's what my brain is and you know I'll just have to deal with it

00:08:27.319 --> 00:08:30.588
But what all the research tells us is that is not the case the more you?

00:08:30.749 --> 00:08:36.888
Stimulate the brain the more you struggle the more you kind of try to tackle new things you can actually train

00:08:37.709 --> 00:08:41.719
Train yourself. Let me see if you can actually train yourself to

00:08:42.269 --> 00:08:49.159
Be to be smart or whether you're smart or not smart is not something that you were just born with you can actually train yourself

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.670
And the best way to train yourself and this it's it's very analogous

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:57.830
and there's a lot of research is very similar to the way that you would train if you're lifting weights if you're lifting weights if

00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:59.339
You can lift five

00:08:59.339 --> 00:09:04.969
Pounds a lot you're not just gonna keep lifting five pounds you want to push yourself you want to try lifting with without you know

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:06.649
Consult your doctor or your trainer

00:09:06.649 --> 00:09:08.240
You don't want to blow out your back or anything

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:14.029
But you want to keep lifting heavier and heavier weights and essentially making your muscle fatigue making your muscles struggle

00:09:14.029 --> 00:09:18.259
It's not always an easy thing, but it pays off and the when you train your brain

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.289
It's essentially the same thing you want to tackle new problems

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:23.209
You don't want to tackle problems that are easy

00:09:23.209 --> 00:09:24.959
But that's just like lifting the two-pound weight

00:09:24.959 --> 00:09:29.659
over and over again you want to lift the 10-pound weight the 20-pound weight to eventually get to the

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:36.440
100-pound weight and so that means tackling problems doing problems that are going to be difficult. Where you you might make a mistake

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.640
But making that mistake is just like you know this picture of arnold where maybe he's not able to lift this weight

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.429
But then as his mom as his body kind of adjusts

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.299
It won't take too much time before he is able to lift that

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:52.729
to lift that weight so the important Takeaway is you you can completely change your intelligence by

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:58.309
Challenging yourself by putting yourself in a stimulating environment and your brain really is like a muscle

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:02.930
The more you train it the more you struggle. The more you stimulate it the smarter you'll get
