00:00:01.872 --> 00:00:04.455
(upbeat music)

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.910
- It's a great pleasure to be allowed

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.510
to introduce professor Lewontin.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.820
He is an old friend and my former

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.650
post doctoral supervisor from my time

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.203
at the University of Chicago.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.883
Professor Lewontin,

00:00:43.883 --> 00:00:46.200
as you heard yesterday Professor Lewontin

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.210
received his undergraduate
degree from Harvard

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.600
and then a master's and PhD
from Columbia University

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.363
where he was a student
with Theodosius Dobzhansky.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.080
He then held faculty positions

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.100
at North Carolina State University,

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.330
the University of Rochester,

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.530
and then the University of
Chicago before moving to Harvard

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.053
to become Alexander Agassiz
Professor of Zoology.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.210
In addition to the great many honors

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.690
that were mentioned yesterday,

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.080
Professor Lewontin was elected

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.540
to the National Academy of Science in 1967

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.613
and then resigned the
National Academy in 1973.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.070
Now Dick Lewontin has
really had two careers,

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.740
one career as an evolutionary geneticist

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.070
and another as a public
spokesman for science.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.990
As an evolutionary geneticist
he's made major contributions

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.410
to both the theory of
evolutionary genetics

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.283
and to its experimental study.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.730
He was among the first to use computers

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.000
as tools for simulation.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.960
He was among the first to use the tools

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.570
of modern molecular
biology to study genetic

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.020
variation in natural populations.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.440
In 1974, he wrote a book entitled

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.480
The Genetic Basis of Evolutionary Change

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.830
which really defined the research program

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.913
in evolutionary genetics ever since.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.110
As a public spokesman for science,

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.550
he has entered I think
every major controversy

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.540
involving genetics and evolution.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.620
If he hasn't, it was only an oversight.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.690
(audience laughing)

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.080
As a result he

00:02:30.662 --> 00:02:33.790
entered the controversy over sociobiology,

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.320
over the use of genetically
modified organisms,

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.160
over race and IQ, over
large-scale genomic projects,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.610
and many other controversies.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.200
In these areas he has
always been provocative,

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.763
controversial, and stubborn.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.480
And it's a great pleasure today

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.130
to introduce him to speak
on one of these topics.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.510
His title is, The Concept
of Race: The Confusion

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.550
of Social and Biological Reality.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.383
Dick.

00:03:06.383 --> 00:03:09.448
(audience applauding)

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:15.810
- Thanks very much, Monty.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.670
I only want to make one
correction to your introduction

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.980
and that is the notion
that I ever supervised you

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.027
is a very extraordinary one.

00:03:23.027 --> 00:03:25.280
(audience laughing)

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.270
We worked together for a while

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.120
but I certainly never supervised him.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.513
The lecture today is rather different

00:03:35.513 --> 00:03:38.440
from the one I gave yesterday.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.150
The one I gave yesterday
was largely impressionistic,

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.550
if you like, and heuristic.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.250
Today I'm gonna bombard you with numbers.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.830
I'm sorry about that.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.330
Those of you who hate numbers,

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.710
perhaps you should leave now.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.310
But the subject of race
as a biological concept

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.840
cannot be dealt with except numerically.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.720
Quantitatively, that is to say,

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.300
and the best way I know
to do it is with numbers.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.812
So I should warn you about that,

00:04:06.812 --> 00:04:11.110
that it may in some ways
be a disappointment to you,

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.600
and I regret that, but I
don't know how else to do it

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.900
with intellectual honesty.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.543
The question of race is a curious one.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.830
The classification and
denomination of others

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.650
as belonging to different races

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.540
is, of course, not a uniquely American

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.893
or European phenomenon.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.080
The Japanese have their
notions about race.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.480
Indeed, the word race
has had many meanings.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.420
We speak, for example, of someone being

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.280
the last of his race, and what we mean

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.920
is the last member of his family.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.420
Or the human race at the other extreme,

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.550
which means the entire species.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.293
So that race, which
comes from the root root,

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.600
means what that person sprang from.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.600
And the notion that we
understand who we are

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.230
and others belong to a different kind,

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.390
a different race, seems
to be if not universal,

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.030
because I don't know
enough about what everybody

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.860
in the world or every culture thinks,

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.930
seems to be extraordinarily widespread.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.275
And I've tried to understand that

00:05:30.275 --> 00:05:33.530
and I think we should
all try to begin with

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.840
to ask ourselves why is it
that the concept of race,

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.230
the division of the world
between us and them,

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.940
whoever us happens to be
and them happens to be,

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.580
why that is so common historically

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.593
and culturally and geographically.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.110
I would like to make a
couple of suggestions.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.423
They're only suggestions.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.060
One is, of course,

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.299
that one is constantly,

00:06:03.299 --> 00:06:06.630
certainly in the history
of the human species

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.000
and in the early history
of the human species

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.500
but still true, there is a kind of

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.120
if I may call it nationalism
or localism or villagism

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.350
or tribalism, whatever you wanna call it.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:23.350
That is to say, a group that
has solidarity living together

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.370
which deals with other groups

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.270
that have their own solidarity

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.520
often in a hostile and contradictory way,

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.520
and so there's the constant reiteration of

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:42.170
the within our group as
opposed to as against those,

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.910
and that occurs at the village level

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.840
in people in the Amazon.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.190
It occurs at the national level in Europe

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.050
and everything in between.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.020
So that constant struggle
between the group

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.480
of which you are a member,

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.760
in which you have some
economic, social, marital,

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.140
other kinds of religious ties

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.460
as against somebody else

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.113
already creates a separation
between them and us.

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:12.860
That seems obvious.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.260
But the other thing which is
perhaps not quite so obvious

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:21.070
is that the concept that
there exists other races

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:25.667
comes in great part from our perception

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.060
of the variation among people in the world

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.860
and the variation that we know

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.383
among those people with
whom we are brought up.

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:38.490
To illustrate that I'll tell a story

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.650
which my wife will tell
me is not quite accurate

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:43.980
but it's what we call
(speaks in foreign language).

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.300
I mean, it's close enough.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.660
She and I were in in Egypt, upper Egypt,

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:52.436
years and years ago, and
we were in a large hotel

00:07:52.436 --> 00:07:55.140
and a man came up to her and started

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:59.660
to talk to her volubly
about something in Egyptian.

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.030
And she kept saying, no, no,

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:02.520
you've got the wrong person.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.440
I mean, I'm sorry, I really don't know

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.645
what you're talking about.

00:08:05.645 --> 00:08:06.478
I don't know what this incident is.

00:08:06.478 --> 00:08:07.870
And he kept at it and kept at it

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:11.280
and she kept insisting that
no, no, he'd made a mistake.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.030
And finally he stepped back and said

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:16.123
oh, I'm terribly sorry, but
you all look alike to me.

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:20.150
And this notion that you all look alike

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:24.680
but we all look different is a consequence

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.270
of our acculturation, our
walking down the street,

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:30.800
our understanding of who is whom.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.300
I mean, again, to make it personal

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:35.280
my wife and I often play a game.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.550
We walk down the street in Cambridge,

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:38.350
which is a very cosmopolitan community,

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.102
unlike Berkeley, of course.

00:08:40.102 --> 00:08:41.500
(audience laughing)

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:46.500
And we walk behind people
and I put my elbow there

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.750
and I say, French.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:51.260
And she'll say, German.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.360
And then we walk a little faster

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.420
in order to catch up with them
to hear what they're saying

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.670
and one of us is right
usually, or the other.

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:03.340
That is to say, the very
motions of their bodies,

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:06.070
the way in which they move their faces

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:10.890
and lips and hands, their
total physical appearance

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:14.170
tells us that they are not Americans

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:16.100
and even gives us hints
about what they are.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.960
My greatest triumph in this respect,

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.560
which I'm very proud of, is that once

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.520
we were in the desert in California

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.700
and on the top of a knoll very far away,

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.240
I mean, twice as far as
the back of this room

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.240
was a group of young people

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.460
who were talking to each other volubly.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:35.070
You couldn't hear a syllable
that they were saying.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:37.949
And I said they are
French, and I was right.

00:09:37.949 --> 00:09:38.910
(audience laughing)

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:42.600
So you you must take account of the fact

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:47.600
that there are local differences
in every aspect of culture

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:51.690
including body appearance
and carriage and so on

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:53.830
of which we are not ordinarily conscious

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:57.580
until we confront people who
come from someplace else.

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:59.360
And the result of that has been

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:04.030
that you all look different
but they all look alike.

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:06.970
And that is a consequence
of that acculturation.

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:09.040
Now the question I wanna talk about today

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:13.700
is really what is it we
know in some objective sense

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.840
about the variation among human beings

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.690
that corresponds or does not correspond

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:24.030
to that perception that
we all look different

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:25.980
and we recognize each other instantly

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.690
but they all look alike.

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:29.290
And what can we say about that?

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:33.080
Because, of course, it has
immense political consequences.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.340
Once you agree that we are all different

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:37.480
but they are all alike,

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.870
you also have a way of
handling the problem

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:46.143
of colonizing them, enslaving them,

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.660
dealing with them in
all kinds of demeaning,

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:53.090
and ways of asymmetric power

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:54.890
because they're all alike anyway.

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:57.630
And that, in a sense, dehumanizes them.

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:00.000
But part of that dehumanizing process

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.890
is not just that they don't look like us

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:04.320
but they are all alike.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.350
They can be objectified.

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:08.604
They belong to a race,

00:11:08.604 --> 00:11:11.580
and once I know that
I know all about them.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:13.190
That's all I need to know.

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:15.080
Whereas, of course, if
I say they're Europeans

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.420
or Americans or something

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:17.720
then that doesn't help me much

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.470
because, after all, we're all different.

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:23.780
So the reason this talk
will be so numerical

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.800
is precisely because we
need to ask the question

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.650
how variable are human
beings within groups

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:33.860
and between groups,

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.720
within those people who speak Swedish

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:39.383
as opposed to those who
are Kikuyu or whatever.

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:44.280
How much objective reality is there

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:48.100
to the claim that I just discussed

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.460
about differences within
and between groups?

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:55.204
And, of course, to say
objective means obviously

00:11:55.204 --> 00:12:00.024
to ask about genes, because
nothing else is objective, so...

00:12:00.024 --> 00:12:01.020
(audience chuckling)

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.770
Well, I mean, I have to apologize for that

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:07.650
because the last lecture
downplayed the importance of genes

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:09.550
but genes have one advantage to us,

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:12.230
and that is we can actually characterize

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:16.920
without any prejudice the
DNA sequences of organisms

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.000
and we can ask questions like

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.230
how much of the variation in DNA sequences

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:27.137
exists among the people
who live in Denmark

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.190
as opposed to the
difference on the average

00:12:32.129 --> 00:12:33.229
between Danes and Ewe.

00:12:34.885 --> 00:12:36.430
I mean, we can ask that question

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:39.910
and that question has some relevance.

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:42.130
Although it's not completely probative,

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:44.763
it has some relevance to
asking questions like,

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.570
do we expect that all
the people in Denmark

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:51.993
will be smarter than all
the people in South Africa.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.810
And that's because we
believe that genes tell us

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:57.130
something about people.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:00.220
So I want to deal with this
issue on a quantitative basis.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.663
I want to ask the question,

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.840
putting perception aside

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.550
and the way in which we
learn to distinguish people

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:09.390
one from another,

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:13.060
what can we say about
actual genetic differences

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:15.220
between individuals, between groups,

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.530
within populations, between populations,

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:21.210
what do we know about the geography

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:23.650
of human biology and what does that tell

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:25.430
us about the concept of race

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:27.240
and how do we have to cope with that

00:13:28.123 --> 00:13:31.020
when we deal with what is a reality?

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:32.950
Race is, look, I want to make it clear

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:34.870
and I tried to make it clear in my title.

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:36.423
Race is a reality.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:40.270
It is a social reality and everybody knows

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:41.620
it's a social reality.

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.290
The issue is what is the relationship

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.020
between that social reality,

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:48.010
that social allocation
of individuals to groups,

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:50.280
and anything we can say
about their biology.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:54.850
So I speak as a biologist
rather than a sociologist,

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:55.730
because there's no question

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:57.380
about the social reality of race.

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:01.130
Now what I wanna do is to go through

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:03.680
some evidence about how many,

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.960
how much difference there is
within and between human groups

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.210
and then discuss what the processes are

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:11.410
that modulate that variation

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:12.850
and why it looks the way it,

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:15.560
probably looks the way it does,

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:19.283
and what we might expect even
in the future in that respect.

00:14:20.921 --> 00:14:23.830
So I guess, Ellen, you gotta help me here.

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:25.280
I can't get on without Ellen.

00:14:26.915 --> 00:14:30.550
I wanna show you a slide
which is sort of typical.

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:31.860
It's gonna take me a minute to explain it,

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:33.333
it but you're stuck with it.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:39.060
This is a diagram having to do
with human ABO blood groups.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.420
You all know your ABO blood group.

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:42.310
You probably know what group you are

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:44.320
whether you're AB, or B, or O.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.060
And this is a so-called trilineal diagram,

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:53.060
and it gives the proportion
of the gene allele A,

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:58.000
the proportion B, and the proportion O

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.363
at the genic level,

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.960
so they add up at 100%.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.150
And it gives the proportion of that

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:05.890
in a particular population.

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:07.450
And what I have done is plot

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:09.870
on this little triangular diagram

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:13.640
the location in this kind of
funny three-dimensional space.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.350
Although it really looks
like two dimensions,

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:17.010
it's really got three dimensions in it.

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:20.460
Frequency of I, frequency of the O allele,

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.310
the A allele and the B allele,

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:24.660
plot various human populations.

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:29.660
And then I've drawn little
circles around clusters.

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.970
This is a cluster here.

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:33.160
There's a cluster here.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.120
There's a cluster here.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.810
And the first question I wanted to ask is,

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:38.830
I mean, this is just
typical of what we'll see.

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:43.830
Is there any geographical or
racial meaning to the clusters?

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:48.180
Let's say if you belong
in the same cluster

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:50.140
is it because you're all Europeans

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:51.600
or you're all Africans?

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.790
So these are different populations.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:55.860
And let me give you an example.

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:59.850
This cluster here consists
of population two,

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:02.600
eight, 10, 13, and 20.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.433
Population two is an African population.

00:16:06.505 --> 00:16:10.680
Eight and 13 are Asian
populations, 20 are Europeans.

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:12.870
So Europeans, Asians, and Africans

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:17.090
all clustered together in
this one little cluster here.

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:20.033
Here's another cluster made
of three, four, and five.

00:16:21.121 --> 00:16:23.540
And number three are Africans,

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:26.770
and four and five are Native Americans.

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:30.130
So this kind of thing
is disturbing already.

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:31.530
I'm just trying to give you an example.

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:33.230
Genetically disturbing to the notion

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:37.533
that there are clear
differences between populations.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:44.057
Okay, this is just an introduction
to the general question

00:16:44.057 --> 00:16:45.330
and the general approach.

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:47.263
No, I don't need the next one quite yet.

00:16:48.832 --> 00:16:52.487
We need to know a few facts
about the human species

00:16:52.487 --> 00:16:56.110
and its genetics which are relevant.

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:58.860
First of all, human beings

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.733
are immensely variable genetically.

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:06.290
The people in this room, one from another,

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:08.600
the person next to you differs

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:12.220
by about three million
nucleotides from you.

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:13.340
Three million.

00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:14.750
Now that's not very many considering

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:16.750
that you have three billion nucleotides,

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:19.350
but nevertheless there are
three million nucleotides

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:22.660
on the average between any
two people in this room.

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:24.610
And by the way, that's
true whether the person

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:26.440
sitting next to you you think belongs

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.040
to the same race as you or not.

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.440
There isn't much difference,
as it'll turn out,

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.730
but three million nucleotides different.

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:37.730
Something like 25% of all
genes of known function

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:45.610
that produce known
enzymes of various kinds

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:48.280
are what we call polymorphic in humans.

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.230
That is to say, there
exists more than one form

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:54.230
of that gene, like the ABO blood groups,

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:56.300
which there is A, B, and O.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.170
So about a quarter of all the genes

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:02.390
that anybody's ever looked
at are variable in this way,

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:05.370
so that some percent of the
population has one variant

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:07.000
and another percent of
the population has another

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.640
and another and another.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.693
So 25% of your genes belong
to the variable class.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.640
Third, something on the order of 10%

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.180
of all your genes

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.720
you got a different form
of it from your mother

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:21.910
than from your father.

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:23.580
You're what is called a heterozygous.

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.770
You've got two different allelic forms.

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:28.291
So about 10% of your genes

00:18:28.291 --> 00:18:31.350
are already different from one another

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:33.680
in the two copies that your got from.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:37.650
And that makes humans pretty
typical of species in general.

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:40.540
I mean, for fruit flies
that I know more about,

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:43.093
the numbers are a third
of them are polymorphic,

00:18:45.085 --> 00:18:47.660
12% are polymorphic, or
you got a different one

00:18:48.979 --> 00:18:50.440
from one parent and the other.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:52.640
But human beings are
sort of typical animals

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:53.610
in this respect.

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:56.330
They're very variable genetically,

00:18:56.330 --> 00:19:00.330
and every one of you is very different

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:01.920
in 10% of your genes,

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.170
or different in 10% of genes

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:06.048
of the gene you got from
your mother and your father.

00:19:06.048 --> 00:19:08.930
Now that's the first thing
we have to understand,

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:11.310
this huge amount of genetic variation.

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:12.810
Now because there is this huge amount

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:14.320
of genetic variation,

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:18.770
we are able to ask a question, which is,

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:23.770
if you are different from the
person sitting next to you

00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:29.980
because of these variable genes,

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:32.280
how much more different are you

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.860
if you have ancestors from completely

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:36.350
different parts of the world

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:38.230
than if you have ancestors who came

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:39.750
from the same part of the world?

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:42.756
If both your ancestors were Swedes,

00:19:42.756 --> 00:19:45.440
does that mean you're much more similar

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:48.830
than if one of your ancestors

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:52.180
was a Swede and the other one was Chinese?

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:55.520
That's a question we can ask objectively.

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.900
The second, and one thing we do know

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.700
and I wanna make this
clear from the beginning,

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.500
we do not know of any gene,

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.540
no one has ever found a gene,

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:08.520
I'm not saying they don't exist,

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:12.630
but in all the searching no
one has ever found a gene

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:16.040
in which one so-called race

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.510
has 100% of one form of the gene

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:22.340
and some other race has 100%
of another form of the gene.

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:26.900
There are no single
genes that differentiate

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:30.390
Africans from Asians,
Asians from Europeans,

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:35.260
Europeans from from Australian
Aborigines, and so on.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:36.970
And the second slide I want to show you

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:41.740
are the most extremely
different genes that we know of

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.067
between the classical races.

00:20:43.067 --> 00:20:44.800
And by the way, for a lot of the time

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.660
when I talk about race

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.910
I'm going along with a gag.

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:52.520
Asians are one race,
Africans are another race,

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.700
Europeans are another race,

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:55.590
Australian Aborigines are another race,

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:57.165
Polynesians are another race.

00:20:57.165 --> 00:20:59.890
I'm gonna talk a lot about that problem,

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:01.620
how you decide, because you can't ask

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.600
how much difference there is between races

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.390
until you tell me how
you know what a race is

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:07.540
and who's in it.

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.720
I mean, do the people of India belong

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.490
to the same race that we do?

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:13.860
If they don't then the
answer will be different

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:15.913
than if they do, so we have that problem.

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:20.250
Here are three genes,
the Duffy blood group,

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:24.574
the Rhesus blood group, and the P factor

00:21:24.574 --> 00:21:27.690
for which there are greater differences

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:29.570
between the classical races.

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:31.340
They even have these classical names,

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:34.760
Caucasoid, Negroid, and
Mongoloid, whatever.

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:37.583
What they mean is white,
yellow, and black, I guess.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.740
What they mean is people from
Africa, people from Europe,

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:44.412
and people from the mainland of Asia.

00:21:44.412 --> 00:21:46.920
And you see that there
are huge differences

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.410
in the frequency of the
three forms of this gene,

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:51.110
the Duffy blood group.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:53.650
Caucasoids only have 3% of FY

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:57.127
and roughly 50/50 numbers of these two

00:21:57.127 --> 00:22:01.010
whereas people from Africa are 94% FY

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:03.610
and that's gonna turn out
to be very useful to us

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:06.853
in asking some questions,
and only 6% of FYA.

00:22:10.727 --> 00:22:13.079
And the Mongoloids are only 9% of this

00:22:13.079 --> 00:22:13.912
and 90% of this.

00:22:13.912 --> 00:22:18.150
So you see huge differentiation
in this particular gene

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:20.420
between these major groups, okay?

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:21.730
That's a maximum.

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:24.300
But notice it is not the case

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:27.020
that Africans are 100% of one thing

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:29.110
and Mongoloids are 100% of another.

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:30.370
There's always overlap,

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:32.370
and that's an extreme
point I want to make.

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:35.593
We don't know of any gene
which is race distinguishing.

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:41.690
Here are three genes
which, on the contrary,

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:43.290
show extreme similarity

00:22:44.271 --> 00:22:47.000
in frequencies of the variant types.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000
The Auberger factor, 62 to 38, 65 to 35.

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.640
I don't have the data for for Asians.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:59.640
XG, 2/3 to 1/3, 55 to
45, 55 to 40, and so on.

00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:03.570
So I put these up to give
you the outside limits

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:04.940
of what we know.

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:08.120
Some genes you can't
distinguish by frequency at all

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.410
between major groups,
but there are a few genes

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:12.163
in which there are big differences.

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:15.870
But that's about all you can say.

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:17.020
But I do want to emphasize,

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.610
again, I've said it three times
but I'm gonna say it again.

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:22.770
We do not know of any gene which,

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:25.000
if you've got it you're certainly,

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.410
I mean, that distinguishes you 100%

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:29.423
from some other so-called racial group.

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:34.853
Okay, now we could dispense with that.

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:39.380
Now what I wanna do is to ask the question

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:41.900
which I began with, how much variation

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:46.240
between individuals lies
within local populations,

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.400
how much of it lies between populations

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.500
belonging to the same what
we call classical race,

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:56.060
and how much of it comes between races.

00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.647
Now to ask that question

00:23:57.647 --> 00:24:00.780
you have to define these
races to begin with.

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:01.750
I can't ask how much genetic difference

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:04.070
is there between races until I decide

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:05.393
who's in what race.

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:09.080
And that turns out to be not so easy.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:13.350
For example, are the
Turks Asians or Europeans?

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:15.970
Well you see, they speak
a Central Asian language

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.330
but they look like Europeans to me.

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:26.590
Are the Urdu and Hindi-speaking people

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:28.780
of the Indian subcontinent,

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:30.850
are they belong to the Caucasians

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:34.080
or should they have their
own group or are they Asians?

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:36.940
What about the people of the Pacific,

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:39.770
the Islanders of the Pacific, and so on.

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:43.200
Each one presents certain
contrasts linguistically

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.640
and physically.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.140
The Finns are a real pain in the neck

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:47.730
because nobody could look

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:50.460
more washed out European than a Finn,

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:53.630
but they, alas, speak a Turkic language,

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:55.500
a language they got from Central Asia.

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:57.800
So maybe we ought to throw
them in with the Chinese.

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:02.540
You see the problem, that the
definition depends in part

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:04.900
on those a priori
perceptions you already have

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:07.960
of what race are and in part
on knowledge about linguistics

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.740
and in part on knowledge
about movements of people.

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:12.920
I'm gonna show you the result of a study,

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.630
the first one that I know
of that was done about this,

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:18.460
in which racial decisions were made

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:21.590
and essentially the world was divided up

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:24.650
into yellows, blacks,
browns, reds, and whites,

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:25.833
with a few extras.

00:25:27.979 --> 00:25:31.290
The people of Southeast Asia were put

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:32.710
in a separate race.

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:35.920
The Oceanians of the Pacific
were put in a separate race.

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:38.593
I mean, something had to be
done, so that was what was done.

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:40.960
We have less problem deciding

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:45.290
whether people belong in
the same national group

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:47.630
or local group within
races, local population,

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:52.400
because we have linguistic definitions.

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.650
I mean, there are some
people who speak Italian,

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:58.030
some Irish, some English, some French,

00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:00.660
and each one of those
linguistic groups is consistent.

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:03.580
We have Ewe and Kikuyu and and so on.

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:05.650
Those are put in separate groups.

00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:06.900
And now we can ask the question,

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:10.960
how much of the known genetic variation,

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.273
of which there's a lot,

00:26:13.161 --> 00:26:16.530
falls between two individuals both of whom

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:20.253
came from Isle de France?

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:24.720
How much of it falls
between French people,

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:28.230
Italians, Germans, Swedes, and so on,

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:32.770
and then how much of it is
between Europeans on the one hand

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:35.480
and Africans, sub-Saharan
Africans on the other.

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.110
So we can break down the variation

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:39.583
to within local populations,

00:26:39.583 --> 00:26:43.060
between populations belonging
to the same so-called race,

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:44.690
and between races.

00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:46.470
And when that study was done,

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:49.093
the result looked like the next slide.

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:52.410
At the time this study was done,

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:55.080
worldwide information existed.

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:57.120
I mean, this study had to depend

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.890
on the literature of science.

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:02.220
Worldwide information existed
for these bunch of genes.

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:04.500
They're a mixture of human blood groups

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:07.490
and various enzyme proteins.

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:10.260
We needn't concern
ourselves of what they are.

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:11.710
And then the question was asked

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:15.850
of all the variation
within the human species

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:19.350
for a particular gene, like the HP gene,

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:21.670
how much of it, what
proportion of that variation

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:24.530
occurs within local populations,

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:29.530
within Zulu, within Italians
within Han Chinese, and so on.

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:33.920
How much of it is between populations,

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:36.132
between Japanese and Chinese,

00:27:36.132 --> 00:27:38.330
between Ewe and Kikuyu,

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:40.210
between Toba and bloods,

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:44.440
between Sioux and Yakuts, and so on.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.350
And the answer, for example, for HP

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:50.990
was that 89% occurred within populations,

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:55.940
5% occurred between populations

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:57.623
within what we would call a race,

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:01.360
and only 5 1/2% percent
occurred between black,

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:04.190
white, yellow, brown, red and the others.

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:06.330
Is this clear to people
what's being done here?

00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:08.640
The total variation is being divided up

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.150
in these three categories.

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:12.617
And if you do that for all the cases,

00:28:12.617 --> 00:28:14.040
and I won't go through all these,

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:16.260
they're just a bunch of
numbers, the grand average,

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:18.771
which you may not be able to
see in the back of the room,

00:28:18.771 --> 00:28:23.400
is that 85.4% of all
human genetic variation

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:26.860
then known by these genetic techniques,

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:31.610
85.4% occurs among individuals belonging

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:34.630
to the same linguistic local group

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:37.303
on the average overall groups,

00:28:38.454 --> 00:28:42.340
within the Yakuts, within the English,

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:45.490
within the Icelanders,
within the Zulu, and so on.

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:46.460
Is that clear?

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:48.490
85%.

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:52.570
A further 8% in this study fell between

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:54.950
linguistic groups within
what we would call a race,

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:56.950
between Italians, French, Germans,

00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:59.490
between Zulu and Ewe and Kikuyu.

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:04.330
And only 6% fell between
these major races.

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:07.810
Now you do appreciate that
although this number here

00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:10.020
doesn't depend on how you define races,

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:11.840
the split between these two does depend

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:13.543
on how you define races,

00:29:13.543 --> 00:29:15.120
which group you put in which race

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.420
and which group you don't.

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.173
But 85% of that variation falls within.

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:26.090
Now this study comes from
the Pleistocene of science.

00:29:27.778 --> 00:29:29.800
I mean, it was done when we knew nothing

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:32.963
about DNA sequences and so on,

00:29:33.924 --> 00:29:38.924
and it's entirely conceivable
that when the thing is updated

00:29:39.082 --> 00:29:41.440
and people actually look at DNA sequences

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.970
that the answer will be quite different.

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:47.700
I want to show you the
result of the studies

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:52.700
of Dr. Barbujani on
DNA sequences in humans

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.630
which are not identified
by any particular genes.

00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:57.610
We don't know what they do,

00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:01.760
they're just chunks of DNA
plunked for various reasons

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.450
out of the human genome.

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:05.360
A huge number of numbers.

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:06.740
Ignore 'em.

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:07.870
Forget the details.

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:09.699
Just believe what I tell you.

00:30:09.699 --> 00:30:11.160
(audience laughing)

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:13.250
Here's the name of all
of these little bits

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:15.660
and pieces of DNA which are recognized

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:18.250
by the techniques of DNA hybridization.

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:19.320
Forget about what they,

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:20.570
nobody knows what they do anyway.

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:22.950
They don't do anything,
they're just genetic variation.

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:27.560
And here is his list of the
percent of the variation

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:31.140
for these different ones
that fall within groups,

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:34.110
and these are not the same as
the genes I just showed you.

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:36.223
The total answer comes out to be 84 1/2%.

00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:40.350
That's pretty close.

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:42.080
In fact, that's closer than any scientist

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:44.400
is entitled to expect.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:48.250
Remember the previous result was 85.4.

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:50.980
Barbujani's result is 84.5.

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:54.223
He got the two last numbers confused.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:59.790
But when he then asked how much is within,

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:01.300
he called it within continents

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:03.100
and that meant that he
had a particular way

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:05.810
of dividing populations
belonging to the same

00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:07.480
or different races which was different

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.873
from the previous study.

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:14.850
He only got 4% between
groups within a race

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:19.040
and 11.7, about 12% between races.

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:22.050
So his between races
was about twice as much

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:23.810
as the previous study,

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:26.079
but the within group variation

00:31:26.079 --> 00:31:28.260
as opposed to the between group variation

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:29.710
was identical with the previous study.

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:32.620
85% within and 15% between,

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:35.620
and depending on how you
decide who goes in what race,

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:38.653
you get more or less these two categories.

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:43.730
In fact, a number of such
studies have been done,

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:46.633
and let me show you all of them.

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:49.140
That's the next slide.

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:52.700
The number of studies being four. (laughs)

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:55.644
It's pretty remarkable, it really is.

00:31:55.644 --> 00:31:58.350
I've never seen a scientific
result as clear as this,

00:31:58.350 --> 00:32:01.050
a numerical scientific
result as clear as this.

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:02.780
Here are the four studies,

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:04.510
the first one based on proteins

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:06.170
is the one I showed you originally.

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:08.630
There's another one by Barry Latterton,

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:11.130
and then one on proteins and a DNA study.

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:15.330
And look at that, 85.4, 83.8, 86.

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:18.450
But you know, the point is
made, thank you very much,

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:22.490
that 85% of the variation
is already present

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:25.940
in all the people who are like us.

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:30.520
And only 15% are someplace else,

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:35.520
and some fraction of
that, between 3% and 8%,

00:32:36.196 --> 00:32:39.900
is people who we think are like us anyway.

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:42.730
I mean, sure, they might
be Swedes and we're Danes,

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:44.640
but we don't make that distinction,

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:45.900
or between French and Irish.

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:50.330
And only something on
the order of 6% to 10%

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:55.173
lies between them, the ones
who all look alike, and us.

00:32:56.169 --> 00:32:58.144
Now that's a fact of life,

00:32:58.144 --> 00:33:00.870
and that's a fact with
which one has to cope,

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:05.440
that there is a strong
contradiction or disagreement

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:10.270
between our perception of
a lot of variation with us

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:12.180
and no variation in them,

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:15.300
with the observation that they're
just as variable as we are

00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:17.390
and the differences between us and them

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:19.663
are pretty small on the
average genetically.

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:27.870
I want to depart from
these results for a moment

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:32.340
to say that doesn't mean
that there are no genes

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:35.099
which are found in some mutations

00:33:35.099 --> 00:33:37.820
which are found in high
frequency in some groups

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:38.930
and not in others.

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:40.740
We all know that Tay-Sachs disease

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:44.070
is in very high frequency
among Ashkenazi Jews

00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:47.320
and is essentially missing
in many other groups.

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.770
That's a special mutation
which has risen in frequency

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:51.910
for some reason we don't understand.

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:54.372
We have guesses about it
but we don't really know.

00:33:54.372 --> 00:33:57.370
Or the famous case of sickle cell anemia

00:33:57.370 --> 00:33:59.880
which is essentially unknown in Finland

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:02.070
but is very common in
Mediterranean groups,

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:03.710
not just African groups, by the way,

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:08.220
but Mediterranean and and
East Indian groups as well.

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:10.760
Various forms of abnormal hemoglobin

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:12.700
are spread through the Mediterranean

00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:14.250
and West African groups.

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:15.810
So it doesn't mean

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:18.550
that because there's 85% variation within

00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:22.160
that you can't find occasional
genes which really do,

00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:24.170
as I showed you in the very first slide

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:27.120
or second slide, the genes which are

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.320
highly differentiated between groups,

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:30.520
but they're not typical.

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:35.170
And we don't need all this
fancy data to know that

00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:39.370
because we identify people of other races

00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:42.950
by things that are genetic.

00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:45.613
You know, skin pigment
differences are genetic.

00:34:46.795 --> 00:34:49.080
What I'm trying to say
is that the differences

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.830
between those groups are only skin deep,

00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:52.904
if I can put it that way.

00:34:52.904 --> 00:34:55.950
And therefore any claim, and
this is the important point,

00:34:55.950 --> 00:35:00.710
any claim that because
there are patent differences

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:02.700
in skin color or height or hair form

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.110
or eye shape or something

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:06.200
between groups in different
parts of the world

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:09.650
that that implies that there are likely

00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:12.960
to be differences in genes that matter

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.490
to any sensible person,

00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:16.540
genes that contribute to our ability

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:19.430
to solve mathematical equations

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:23.510
or to be nice to other people
or something like that,

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:25.130
if such genes exist.

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:27.880
But that carryover cannot be made

00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:31.100
because the genes that are very different

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:32.880
are the exception rather than the rule.

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:35.614
That doesn't prove, and I have to say

00:35:35.614 --> 00:35:38.200
to avoid a question that
someone will ask me,

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:41.200
that doesn't prove that
there isn't a gene someplace,

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.980
nobody's ever found it,

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:47.980
that might influence your
charitable instincts,

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:51.020
and that maybe people in Africa

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:52.660
have a much higher frequency of that gene

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:55.350
than people in England.

00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:58.020
That could be, but nobody's ever found it

00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:01.023
and there's no reason to
think that such things exist.

00:36:03.491 --> 00:36:08.491
So those are the facts about
human genetic variation,

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:09.513
that tremendous variation,

00:36:09.513 --> 00:36:14.213
almost all of it within any local group.

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.730
And the question we have to ask is

00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:20.270
how come how does that come to be

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:22.940
in the face of the fact
that there are some obvious

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:24.400
physical differences between people

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.050
in different parts of the world,

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:29.283
skin color for example,
hair form, and so on.

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:34.520
And that means we have
to ask about the forces

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:38.960
that operate on genetic differences

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.673
between and within groups.

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:46.750
The first thing I want to show you

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:51.750
is that most of the extreme
differences that we know of

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:55.990
where there's a very low
frequency of one form

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:58.500
of a gene in one group
and a very high frequency

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:01.020
of another form in another group,

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:05.500
most of them are between
small isolated populations,

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:09.130
hunters and gatherers or
people living in jungle regions

00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:10.190
or something like that.

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:13.950
They're not between the
main body of West Africans

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:16.080
and the main body of Europeans.

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:18.530
That's not true for
everything, but this is a list,

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:20.650
and we're not gonna go down the list

00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:24.010
but notice that, for example,

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:26.160
for this gene phosphoglucomutase

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.790
the lowest frequency of that gene

00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:29.470
is known among Habana Jews

00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:32.100
and the highest, which
is a very small group,

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:34.750
and the highest frequency
among the Yanomami Indians.

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:37.943
Take another one.

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:45.620
Here's NS, it's a blood
group type and secretor type.

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:49.060
5% is the extreme low value in the Navajo

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:50.973
and 65% in Palawans.

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:54.623
Zero in Luo, 96% in Papuans.

00:37:56.962 --> 00:38:00.902
Ainu appear, Basques appear,
Blood Indians appear,

00:38:00.902 --> 00:38:04.730
Chenchu, Eskimo, Dyaks,
people of the Yucatan,

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:06.680
people on Tristan da Cunha, and so on.

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:09.710
Over and over again the
names of these groups,

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:13.660
which are at one extreme or
another of the genetic variation

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:18.270
are names of small groups
living in out-of-the-way places

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:20.830
fairly isolated from other groups.

00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:23.580
And that's a very important observation,

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:26.470
that most of the genetic differences

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:29.360
are differences at the extreme.

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.970
If you think of all the
frequencies of genes

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:33.900
as sort of being clustered in a space,

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:35.810
then the ones on the outside of the ball,

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:37.470
the ones that are oddball

00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:40.250
are these very small populations

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:43.930
isolated from one another, and
we have to understand that.

00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:44.960
It's not always true.

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:48.633
You can find exceptions here,
but it is the general rule.

00:38:49.598 --> 00:38:52.330
And the question is, why is that?

00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:56.270
How come my list contains
all these oddball,

00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:59.310
I mean, oddball in the
sense of of small groups

00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:01.050
outside of our experience.

00:39:04.486 --> 00:39:06.100
Part of the reason,

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:09.310
probably an important part
of the reason, we don't know.

00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:11.500
By the way, we don't know the answer

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:12.930
because we don't know for example

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:15.980
how natural selection might
operate on these genes

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:18.430
to make Papuans have one form

00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:21.500
and Luo have another form.

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:24.210
But probably the answer
has to do with the fact

00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:26.870
that they are very small in numbers,

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:29.960
and when populations are
very small in numbers

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:32.280
then they differentiate from one another

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:35.540
in the kinds of genes
they have by sheer chance.

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:38.760
Let me show you one of the
most extreme cases I know.

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:41.163
This is really a very striking case.

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:46.460
This is a genetic type that people use

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:48.760
in forensic uses of DNA.

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.470
They say, oh, your honor,

00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:53.420
the probability that the person on trial

00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:56.583
did not commit the crime
is one in 4,327,256

00:39:58.139 --> 00:40:02.240
because we know that because
we looked at his DNA.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.970
This is one of those DNA differences

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:05.570
that are used for that,

00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:06.850
and I wanted to call your attention

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:09.500
to the frequency distribution of the nine

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:13.800
different kinds known in two populations,

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:18.800
the Karitiana which are 97% number one

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.290
and 3% number six and don't
have any of the others

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:25.820
as compared to the Surui who

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:30.500
have 56% of one and 14%
of two 14% of seven,

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:31.970
ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:34.890
Who are the Karitiana and the Surui?

00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:39.185
They are two Brazilian
Indian forest-dwelling groups

00:40:39.185 --> 00:40:42.240
living within 500 miles of each other

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:45.841
and they are as extremely
different as you can get

00:40:45.841 --> 00:40:47.540
with respect to this gene.

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:48.540
How did that happen?

00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:52.210
They're even linguistically
separated from one another.

00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:55.570
So somehow in the history of the evolution

00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:59.340
of these groups they have become
extraordinarily divergent.

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:02.260
It's be hard to make the case, I think,

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:05.500
that natural selection favored number one

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:08.510
in the Karitiana and number,

00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:09.980
and something else in the Surui,

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:11.730
but I suppose it's possible.

00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:13.340
But the answer is almost certainly

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:17.690
a consequence of the small
size of the breeding group,

00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:20.210
and the way it works is as follows.

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:21.500
You have a very small number of people

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:23.820
who represent the breeding population.

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:25.730
Some of those people have no children,

00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:28.810
some have one, some have
two, some have three.

00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:32.610
Moreover, if I have two
different forms of a gene,

00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:34.210
half of my sperm have one form

00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:35.890
and half of 'em have the other,

00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:38.620
and if I only have one
kid that kid will have

00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:41.730
one or the other but it
can't have both of them.

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:44.470
So the result of that
is that every generation

00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:46.670
there's a kind of sampling process,

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:48.800
like tossing a coin by chance.

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:51.170
And that means if you
start out a population

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:53.270
with 50/50 of two forms,

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:56.870
the next generation made up of 27 people

00:41:56.870 --> 00:42:01.870
or 420 or even a 1,000 will
not have exactly 50/50.

00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:06.514
They may be 48 to 52 or even 45 to 55.

00:42:06.514 --> 00:42:09.340
Well, what about the
generation after that?

00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:10.810
Well, they don't tend to go back.

00:42:10.810 --> 00:42:12.520
There's no law of averages,

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:14.960
because they started
out with 45% of one type

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:17.470
and 55% of the other
so the next generation

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:19.640
makes a sample from that,

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:23.060
and it's what's known in our
field as a drunkards walk.

00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:26.580
That is, say, what happens
if the frequency of the gene

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:28.910
goes from zero over
there to one over there,

00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:31.070
then the frequency of the
thing every generation

00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:34.830
takes random steps back
and forth like this,

00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:37.460
and if you wait long enough
it falls off the platform

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:38.860
on one side or the other.

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:41.870
That is, say everybody
has one kind or the other,

00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:43.460
but some groups will have one kind

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:45.510
and other drunkards will fall over there.

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:48.150
And that's what's known as the process

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:50.220
of random genetic drift.

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:54.105
And all populations and all genes

00:42:54.105 --> 00:42:56.380
are subject to this phenomenon,

00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:59.210
but a very small population is obviously

00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:02.080
much more subject to it
than a very big population.

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:05.950
So we expect indeed that
very small populations

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:07.870
will tend to be outliers.

00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:09.610
They will be more drunken, if you like,

00:43:09.610 --> 00:43:11.610
in this random walk, and will be closer

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:13.730
to one of the edge points than others.

00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:16.460
And that is a very important factor

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:18.680
in the differentiation of groups.

00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:23.660
So even though it's
true that a fair amount

00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:26.580
of genetic variation
occurs between populations

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:28.459
and between major groups,

00:43:28.459 --> 00:43:30.400
that is not the same as saying

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:33.340
that those differences
arose for functional

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:35.240
and natural selective reasons

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:36.967
because this population ought to have that

00:43:36.967 --> 00:43:39.260
and the other population
ought to have that.

00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:41.900
A good part of that
variation between groups

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:43.243
is sheer chance,

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:47.273
and I must emphasize that

00:43:47.273 --> 00:43:49.841
because you don't want to make too much

00:43:49.841 --> 00:43:52.341
of the variation of the
differences that do exist.

00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:56.140
The other feature which we
have to take into account,

00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:58.730
the very important feature
we have to take into account

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:03.500
in trying to understand
the origins of variations

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:06.930
have to do with the fact
that human populations

00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:10.943
have been migrating, slave-taking, raping,

00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:15.813
carrying off other populations

00:44:15.813 --> 00:44:17.690
presumably in prehistoric time

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:19.720
and certainly in all historical time.

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:22.140
Let me say a brief word
about the Icelanders.

00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:25.750
Some of you have heard
that some people in Iceland

00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:28.910
claim that Icelanders are
more genetically homogeneous

00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:31.750
than anybody else in the
world, and why is that?

00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:36.112
Because Iceland was founded
by a few hardy Vikings

00:44:36.112 --> 00:44:39.680
and after that all the breeding
occurred within Iceland

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:42.380
and no foreign genes came
in, and therefore Iceland,

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:44.270
everybody is related to everybody

00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:46.360
and therefore that would be very good for,

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:49.110
I don't know, some medical
purpose that I can't fathom.

00:44:50.110 --> 00:44:51.730
But the reason I haven't
tried to fathom it

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:54.060
is because it happens to be untrue.

00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:57.320
If you look at these data
about genetic variation

00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:59.730
of all these kinds for Icelanders,

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:01.700
they turn out to be, roughly speaking,

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:06.050
as variable as Norwegians,
English, Scottish,

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:08.610
Danes, and so on, and indeed they fall

00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:11.110
right down in the middle of all Europeans.

00:45:11.110 --> 00:45:13.510
I mean, they're far from
being the most homogeneous

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:14.660
of all Europeans.

00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:16.120
They are sort of in the middle someplace.

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:17.160
They're nothing special.

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:18.880
And why is that?

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:22.420
Because if you, and as every geneticist,

00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:24.050
human geneticist should do,

00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:27.420
if you read the Sagas,
the Icelandic Sagas,

00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:30.940
you will discover that the
Icelanders made a living

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:32.980
exactly, the Icelandic Vikings

00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:34.050
made a living exactly the way

00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:36.450
the classical Greeks made a living,

00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:38.940
namely they were farmers half the year

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:41.220
and the other half the
year they were pirates.

00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:45.870
They got on their boats
and they went off raiding.

00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:50.010
And when you raided, you just
didn't take money and things,

00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:51.890
you took girls, too.

00:45:51.890 --> 00:45:53.610
And there were slaves in Iceland.

00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:56.910
Those slaves came from Russia,
they came from Scotland,

00:45:56.910 --> 00:45:59.540
they came from all over the North Sea.

00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:00.817
There was a tremendous
amount of slave-taking

00:46:00.817 --> 00:46:03.980
and a tremendous amount
of the sort of thing

00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:06.190
you expect from pirates.

00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:09.840
And the consequence of that is
that the Icelandic population

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:12.520
is as heterogeneous as any,

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:15.220
genetically heterogeneous
as any population in Europe.

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:17.640
Indeed, you can trace that.

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:21.370
I should take a cultural detour here.

00:46:21.370 --> 00:46:23.813
I do urge you, those of
you who are interested

00:46:23.813 --> 00:46:24.810
in the subject, to read the Sagas.

00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:26.850
They're a real eye-opener.

00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:30.669
If you look at place names

00:46:30.669 --> 00:46:33.533
around the northern border of Scotland,

00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:38.350
the northern 1/3 of the Scottish coast,

00:46:38.350 --> 00:46:40.010
you will discover a lot of place names

00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:43.381
that have the word ness
in them like Lochness

00:46:43.381 --> 00:46:45.335
and Inverness and so on.

00:46:45.335 --> 00:46:48.100
Ness is the Icelandic word for cape,

00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:54.220
and it's the capes on
which these pirates landed

00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:58.470
and set up little settlements.

00:46:58.470 --> 00:47:02.400
So northern Scotland is as
Icelandic as it is anything else.

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:04.690
And it's extremely
important to understand,

00:47:04.690 --> 00:47:06.700
I tell the story in some detail

00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:10.534
because this is the
story of human movement

00:47:10.534 --> 00:47:14.020
and mating and so on,
a lot of moving around,

00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:16.790
a lot of taking of captives, of slaves,

00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:18.487
of rape, of all that kinda,

00:47:18.487 --> 00:47:20.783
and it's gone on all over the world.

00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:24.820
I mean, you might like to think

00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:27.563
that Europeans invented
slavery, but they didn't.

00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:31.383
Now I want to show you, for example,

00:47:32.310 --> 00:47:37.310
the effect of cross group
mating in the United States.

00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:45.450
We have a fairly good idea
from this FY blood group

00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:48.470
that I showed you, which
is highly differentiated

00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:52.910
between Africans and Europeans,

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:56.632
of how much mating has occurred

00:47:56.632 --> 00:48:01.550
between Africans in North
America brought over as slaves

00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:03.270
and their European masters,

00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:06.940
or more recently between
Africans in urban areas

00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:09.360
and Europeans in urban areas.

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:12.190
There's a history of
mating that's occurred

00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:13.310
between these two groups,

00:48:13.310 --> 00:48:16.283
and we have a fairly good
notion of how much that is.

00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:20.650
Our estimate based on this gene

00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:22.140
that happens to be highly differentiated

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:23.640
between Africans and Europeans

00:48:24.718 --> 00:48:28.600
is that among people
who classify themselves

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:30.570
as Afro-Americans or Blacks,

00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:32.613
at that time they were
classified as Blacks,

00:48:33.526 --> 00:48:37.353
the proportion of their
European ancestry was 19%.

00:48:38.850 --> 00:48:42.580
Among those who live
in Detroit it was 26%.

00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:46.090
Among those in Oakland,
California it was 22%.

00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:48.350
Among the people in
Charleston, South Carolina

00:48:48.350 --> 00:48:50.053
it was only 4%.

00:48:52.064 --> 00:48:54.990
And in Evans and Bulloch
counties in Georgia,

00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:57.630
rural counties, it was 11%.

00:48:57.630 --> 00:49:00.137
So that gives you some notion of how much

00:49:00.137 --> 00:49:01.920
intermixture has gone on.

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:04.310
Various people who are
classified as Afro-American

00:49:04.310 --> 00:49:05.810
have various amounts of European

00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:08.780
and American Indian
ancestry, but on the average

00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:12.450
in the larger cities of the United States

00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:16.900
people have something like
20% to 25% European ancestry.

00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:20.840
And that's only been
going on in large amount

00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:26.273
presumably since the
beginning of the 19th century,

00:49:27.550 --> 00:49:29.113
or perhaps a little earlier.

00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:33.570
So the rate of infiltration of genes

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:35.350
from one group into another

00:49:35.350 --> 00:49:38.420
where the groups themselves still maintain

00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:41.460
some kind of arbitrary
racial classification,

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:42.293
and that's important.

00:49:42.293 --> 00:49:44.130
Look, this is an underestimate

00:49:44.130 --> 00:49:46.410
because it's only the
people who report themselves

00:49:46.410 --> 00:49:47.830
as being African American.

00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:49.190
How about all the people in this room

00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:52.406
who don't report themselves
as being African American,

00:49:52.406 --> 00:49:55.890
but like Pushkin have
an African grandfather

00:49:55.890 --> 00:49:56.820
or great-grandfather.

00:49:56.820 --> 00:49:58.700
Pushkin was a great guy.

00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:00.570
Alexander Pushkin's great-grandfather

00:50:00.570 --> 00:50:03.330
was a famous general, Russian general,

00:50:03.330 --> 00:50:05.180
who was, in fact, an African,

00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:08.600
who was a kind of Russian Othello.

00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:12.413
He became a very important
person in the Russian military.

00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:16.270
Pushkin would not have
reported himself as black,

00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:19.963
but 1/8 of his genes came from Africa.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.073
And that's important to understand that.

00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:26.190
Okay, you don't have to see the numbers.

00:50:27.610 --> 00:50:31.250
So you have fusion of populations

00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:35.450
but you also have, on
the the other face of it,

00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:40.330
a tremendous amount of local marriages

00:50:40.330 --> 00:50:43.000
and staying where you are,

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.770
and you also have the effect of migrations

00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:50.970
and of conquests like the Icelanders

00:50:50.970 --> 00:50:54.050
which leave their genetic trace in places

00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:56.578
where they came in.

00:50:56.578 --> 00:50:59.443
And we could look at the next picture,

00:51:00.350 --> 00:51:03.950
that first map which is supposed to be

00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:05.740
of the British Isles.

00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:06.640
It is.

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:08.290
You will notice that migration also occurs

00:51:08.290 --> 00:51:10.670
by continental drift because in the north

00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:13.321
of the British Isles is Kyushu.

00:51:13.321 --> 00:51:14.370
I don't know.

00:51:14.370 --> 00:51:16.950
I don't know how Kyushu got
just to the north of Scotland.

00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:18.840
but there it is.
(audience laughing)

00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:19.680
Please ignore it.

00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:21.970
You'll see Kyushu on another slide.

00:51:21.970 --> 00:51:26.970
This is a map of the frequencies
of the blood group, A,

00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:30.390
ordinary blood group A,

00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:33.520
in different parts of
England and Scotland.

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:35.130
I don't know if you can see
it at the back of the room

00:51:35.130 --> 00:51:37.010
but the average frequency
in northern Scotland

00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:39.270
is 31% of type A.

00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:43.570
It gets down to be 35%, 39%,
down to greater and greater.

00:51:43.570 --> 00:51:48.570
And just off the east
coast of England it is 46%.

00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:55.646
Now England, as you
know, is one of the most,

00:51:55.646 --> 00:51:59.350
as they used to say, bastardized
countries in the world.

00:51:59.350 --> 00:52:02.590
It is a consequence of invasions

00:52:02.590 --> 00:52:07.590
from Denmark and Saxony, from France,

00:52:09.370 --> 00:52:12.260
from the north of Vikings and so on,

00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:16.800
and what has happened is
that where the invaders land

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:20.060
they leave their genes, quite locally,

00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:24.110
and even though those
invaders no longer arrived

00:52:24.110 --> 00:52:26.070
after the 11th century,

00:52:26.070 --> 00:52:30.590
the last time there was
serious invasions of England

00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:35.590
was the 11th century, their
genes have stayed around.

00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:40.540
And if you look, this part
of England which is called,

00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:41.690
I don't know how you
pronounce it in English,

00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:43.855
Dane-law or Dan-a-law,

00:52:43.855 --> 00:52:47.060
Danelaw, which has a lot of
Danish place names and so on,

00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:49.053
has Danish blood group frequencies.

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:51.720
And this part has Pictish

00:52:52.930 --> 00:52:55.320
and Gaelic blood group frequencies.

00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:57.920
And Ireland, which is not shown
in here, is quite different.

00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:02.920
However you notice 37.6 right
here, that's like Ireland.

00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:04.073
Why is that?

00:53:04.073 --> 00:53:05.840
Because that's where Liverpool is

00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:08.770
and that's where large
numbers of Irish immigrants

00:53:08.770 --> 00:53:11.690
arrive still into Britain.

00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:13.570
So despite the fact,

00:53:13.570 --> 00:53:15.350
and I was talking to
Monty Slatkin about this,

00:53:15.350 --> 00:53:17.090
I was puzzled by it but he, I think,

00:53:17.090 --> 00:53:18.520
gave me the right answer.

00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:23.230
Despite the fact that England
has, since the 17th century,

00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:26.090
since the acts of enclosure,
the first acts of enclosure,

00:53:26.090 --> 00:53:28.290
had a huge amount of migration of people

00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:32.463
into cities from the countryside,

00:53:32.463 --> 00:53:35.520
the ones that are left behind,

00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:39.240
see, Liverpool does influence this

00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:41.330
but London apparently not much.

00:53:41.330 --> 00:53:43.570
The ones that are left
behind in the country

00:53:43.570 --> 00:53:46.640
are the descendants of those invaders

00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:49.210
or the Picts who were pushed north

00:53:49.210 --> 00:53:51.620
or the Danes who came in
and so on and so forth.

00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:56.210
So still to this day Britain shows

00:53:56.210 --> 00:53:59.280
the history of invasions

00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:02.331
of more than 1,000 years ago.

00:54:02.331 --> 00:54:04.640
Now that's not only true of Britain.

00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:06.940
The other extremely industrialized country

00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:09.810
for which this is true is Japan.

00:54:09.810 --> 00:54:14.270
There's Hokkaido, Honshu,
Shikoku, and Kyushu

00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:16.220
and here's the Korean Peninsula,

00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:19.430
and this is the frequency of
the blood group A in Japan

00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:23.400
which is about 24% in Hokkaido

00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:26.760
among the Ainu and Japanese in Hokkaido,

00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:31.120
and reaches a maximum
of more than 30% here.

00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:35.102
This cline in frequencies is maintained

00:54:35.102 --> 00:54:38.080
despite the fact that Japan
is highly industrialized

00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:39.620
and that great deal of movement

00:54:39.620 --> 00:54:41.353
because of people who stay behind.

00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:45.830
But this is much more ancient in some ways

00:54:45.830 --> 00:54:49.170
and more recent in others
than the English situation.

00:54:49.170 --> 00:54:52.320
I call your attention to this cluster here

00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:55.803
across the Straits of Tsushima from Korea,

00:54:58.350 --> 00:55:00.380
which has this gene frequency

00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:02.370
which is like the Korean gene frequency.

00:55:02.370 --> 00:55:06.273
People living across the
Straits of Tsushima from Korea,

00:55:07.251 --> 00:55:10.826
in Kyushu and and southern Honshu,

00:55:10.826 --> 00:55:13.440
have gene frequencies like the Koreans.

00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:14.490
Why is that?

00:55:14.490 --> 00:55:17.130
Because there were repeated invasions

00:55:17.130 --> 00:55:19.950
of the Japanese archipelago from Korea

00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:22.760
over and over again by the Chinese,

00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:24.700
by the mainland Chinese.

00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:29.700
And the last of those
invasions occurred in the,

00:55:30.350 --> 00:55:31.840
somebody's gonna tell
me I'm wrong about this

00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:33.593
but I'm gonna say the 15th century,

00:55:35.469 --> 00:55:37.920
and that last attempted
invasion was in the 15th century

00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:39.350
but it didn't work.

00:55:39.350 --> 00:55:40.183
Why?

00:55:40.183 --> 00:55:41.710
Because the invasion fleet

00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:43.950
which was leaving Korea to arrive in Japan

00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:48.950
was blown away by a huge tropical storm

00:55:50.090 --> 00:55:55.090
which was called the wind of the gods,

00:55:55.550 --> 00:55:58.370
which in Japanese is kamikaze.

00:55:58.370 --> 00:56:03.370
So the first famous
kamikaze got rid of that

00:56:03.583 --> 00:56:06.530
and the Chinese never tried it again.

00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:09.850
Nevertheless, since the 15th century

00:56:09.850 --> 00:56:12.440
that differentiation has remained

00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:14.640
and is probably the historic,

00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:16.920
the longtime history of Japan

00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:20.030
with northern Aborigines here

00:56:20.030 --> 00:56:23.390
and mainland Asians here fusing together

00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:25.570
to form the modern Japanese population

00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:27.253
and the cline still shows.

00:56:28.170 --> 00:56:30.980
So what I'm trying to emphasize to you

00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:32.490
is if you want to understand

00:56:32.490 --> 00:56:34.710
the genetic differentiation between people

00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:37.320
you have to understand that
a constant feature of it

00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:41.130
has been invasions from
one place to another,

00:56:41.130 --> 00:56:42.900
cross mating, and the world

00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:44.387
is a kind of hodgepodge made of that.

00:56:44.387 --> 00:56:46.050
And the last picture I'm gonna show

00:56:46.050 --> 00:56:48.820
is a very abstract picture which I cannot

00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:51.543
possibly explain to you correctly.

00:56:51.543 --> 00:56:55.560
It's an attempt to
summarize everything we know

00:56:55.560 --> 00:57:00.063
about gene frequency
differences all in one number.

00:57:01.293 --> 00:57:04.130
It's called a principal component,

00:57:04.130 --> 00:57:06.630
and maybe a few of you, like Leo Goodman,

00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:09.210
know what that means, but I'm
not gonna try to explain it.

00:57:09.210 --> 00:57:12.440
It's a way of combining the numbers

00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:16.370
from all the different
genes in an optimal way.

00:57:16.370 --> 00:57:21.370
And what this shows is the
value, roughly speaking,

00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:24.610
of that principal component
of human variation

00:57:24.610 --> 00:57:28.330
in Africa, Europe, coming
across Europe this way,

00:57:28.330 --> 00:57:30.150
getting smaller and smaller and smaller

00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:33.150
and being smallest in Asia.

00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:34.910
That's the so-called
first principal component.

00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:39.640
And what it reveals is the
big picture of migration

00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:42.570
in the Eastern Hemisphere.

00:57:42.570 --> 00:57:44.173
Well, in the world, in fact.

00:57:45.210 --> 00:57:50.210
You had a northward spread
from Africa into Europe

00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:52.120
so the European gene,

00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:53.570
the European gene frequencies

00:57:53.570 --> 00:57:56.130
in their principal component
are most like Africa.

00:57:56.130 --> 00:57:58.270
I know that'll be very
alarming to some Europeans,

00:57:58.270 --> 00:57:59.263
but there it is.

00:58:00.170 --> 00:58:03.350
The Slavs are somewhat less Africanized,

00:58:03.350 --> 00:58:05.380
and then when you get into Central Asia

00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:06.920
it changes somewhat,

00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:10.360
and then you get into central, the steps,

00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:12.820
when you get into Central
Asia it moves again.

00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:15.260
Australian Aborigines
are off by themselves,

00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:16.750
and then these Asians,

00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:19.610
these Siberians moved into the new world

00:58:19.610 --> 00:58:21.540
and moved south and so on.

00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:26.340
This is a picture of the general migration

00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:29.440
of people from prehistoric times

00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:33.053
perhaps, from the origin
of humans in Africa.

00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:36.740
So if you want to understand,

00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:38.300
and now you have to tell me,

00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:40.180
where are the racial boundaries?

00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:42.410
Well, if I use principal components

00:58:42.410 --> 00:58:44.490
then of course all the Africans

00:58:44.490 --> 00:58:47.953
and their English and French
masters belong to one race.

00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:52.805
The people of Central
Europe belong to another

00:58:52.805 --> 00:58:54.260
and so on and so forth.

00:58:54.260 --> 00:58:55.093
Which doesn't, of course,

00:58:55.093 --> 00:58:57.133
correspond to what you ordinarily think.

00:58:58.735 --> 00:59:03.735
So my final point is that
human genetic variation,

00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:07.483
we can get rid of that last slide, Ellen.

00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:12.070
The human genetic variation
is the consequence

00:59:12.070 --> 00:59:14.750
of a long history of migration,

00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:19.110
of cross mating, of
piracy, of slave-taking.

00:59:19.110 --> 00:59:22.450
You know, by the way, I'll just
make a parenthetical remark.

00:59:22.450 --> 00:59:26.909
If you read Henry M. Stanley's journal

00:59:26.909 --> 00:59:29.573
of how he found Livingstone in Africa,

00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:34.120
you find that as he moved
across from the coast

00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:38.240
to Lake Victoria, he
passed through one town.

00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:40.260
He didn't hack his way
through any jungles.

00:59:40.260 --> 00:59:41.570
He walked on a road,

00:59:41.570 --> 00:59:43.943
and that road passed
through a lot of towns.

00:59:45.279 --> 00:59:47.180
And the chief in those
towns was always called

00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:51.310
the Sheikh because, of course, the Arabs

00:59:51.310 --> 00:59:52.910
had been there long since

00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:56.120
and they had left behind not only culture

00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:57.950
but genes as well.

00:59:57.950 --> 01:00:01.649
East Africa is very much Arabized,

01:00:01.649 --> 01:00:04.140
at least in Henry M. Stanley's time.

01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:05.330
So the picture you have to have

01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:09.480
is of a mobile species
moving from its origin

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.220
throughout the world, occupying the world,

01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:15.400
and in the process by mercantile movement,

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:18.110
by slave-taking and so
on, mixing things up,

01:00:18.110 --> 01:00:20.880
leaving behind some variation

01:00:22.830 --> 01:00:25.290
whose origin we don't really understand.

01:00:25.290 --> 01:00:28.170
I mean, I don't know why
people in West Africa

01:00:28.170 --> 01:00:31.540
have dark skins and people
in Finland have light skins.

01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:33.340
Don't believe the stories.

01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:35.760
And I wanna end this,
don't believe the stories

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:39.538
that, well, it's because if you're in,

01:00:39.538 --> 01:00:42.300
in the far north you don't get much UV.

01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:44.350
If you don't get enough
UV you'll have rickets,

01:00:44.350 --> 01:00:46.160
so it's better to have
the lightest possible skin

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:48.870
so you get as much
ultraviolet as possible.

01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:50.933
Whereas if you live in darkest Africa,

01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:54.860
why, you might get skin cancer

01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:56.990
if you didn't filter
out all that sunlight,

01:00:56.990 --> 01:01:00.107
so natural selection's
made your skin dark.

01:01:00.107 --> 01:01:03.930
Those stories don't work
for a variety of reasons.

01:01:03.930 --> 01:01:08.890
One is because even
the most avid sun lover

01:01:08.890 --> 01:01:13.710
of the Los Angeles beaches
who finally gets skin cancer

01:01:13.710 --> 01:01:16.150
from constantly being irradiated

01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:20.173
generally gets that skin cancer
after reproductive years.

01:01:21.426 --> 01:01:24.570
It's not a serious issue
in reproductive rates.

01:01:24.570 --> 01:01:28.790
And as far as UV is
concerned in the far north,

01:01:28.790 --> 01:01:32.020
it's not clear to me that
if some people got rickets

01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:34.740
that had any effect on the
reproductive rate at all.

01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:36.870
The most fertile mouse I ever worked with

01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:38.700
when I used to work with mice

01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:41.010
was a so-called paralytic mouse,

01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:44.000
a male who could barely
get himself around.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.030
So those stories are easy to tell

01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:49.170
but we have no evidence about them.

01:01:49.170 --> 01:01:52.650
My best guess is that the
differences in skin color,

01:01:52.650 --> 01:01:55.270
hair form, eye shape and so on

01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:57.720
are a consequence of Darwin's notion,

01:01:57.720 --> 01:01:59.230
a notion that Darwin had

01:01:59.230 --> 01:02:01.610
and that of so-called sexual selection,

01:02:01.610 --> 01:02:05.920
that for one accidental
historical reason or another

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:09.701
the person who was darkest
in skin in your place

01:02:09.701 --> 01:02:12.140
seemed most powerful and most attractive

01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:14.130
and became the model for beauty,

01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:19.130
whereas someplace else
it was some other oddball

01:02:19.277 --> 01:02:20.940
morphological feature.

01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:22.450
And the consequence is that

01:02:22.450 --> 01:02:24.770
there is by reduplication of that

01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:28.090
a buildup of differentiation based on

01:02:28.090 --> 01:02:31.020
who wants to have, mate with whom.

01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:32.080
Now that's just a guess.

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:32.913
I don't know.

01:02:32.913 --> 01:02:36.030
But none of those natural
selection stories work,

01:02:36.030 --> 01:02:39.940
and I think you should abolish
them from your notions.

01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:43.727
We do not know why the
skin-deep, superficial,

01:02:43.727 --> 01:02:46.095
minority differences in genes

01:02:46.095 --> 01:02:50.350
that do exist between major
geographical regions exist.

01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:53.200
We don't even know where the
genes for skin color are.

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:54.480
Nobody's ever found them.

01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:56.770
I mean, they're there
somewhere, but we don't know.

01:02:56.770 --> 01:03:00.760
Okay, so let me then end by saying that

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:04.073
although race is unquestionably a reality,

01:03:04.073 --> 01:03:07.520
a social reality in
every place in the world,

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:10.700
it is not a very good biological reality.

01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:12.740
It doesn't make sense biologically.

01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:15.120
It's not the way a systematist would want

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:19.230
to divide up the species,
if they are sensible.

01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:24.230
It is rather an excuse
for a social reality

01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:28.550
and an attempt to prove
that that social reality

01:03:28.550 --> 01:03:32.550
must also correspond to deep
and important differences,

01:03:32.550 --> 01:03:34.350
some of which are appearing on the surface

01:03:34.350 --> 01:03:36.230
but most of which are
inside and important,

01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:38.083
and the evidence is against that.

01:03:39.328 --> 01:03:42.980
And so I think you need
to reject the notion

01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:47.131
that race is a sensible
biological concept for humans.

01:03:47.131 --> 01:03:48.105
Thank you.

01:03:48.105 --> 01:03:51.272
(audience applauding)

01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:00.173
And again, I apologize
for all the numbers.

01:04:01.248 --> 01:04:03.747
If there are questions,

01:04:03.747 --> 01:04:06.920
Ellen has said that you must
come up to this microphone

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:08.273
and ask the question.

01:04:10.610 --> 01:04:12.100
- [Audience Member] So
what is the latest status

01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:16.190
of Out of Africa theory and
multiregional hypothesis?

01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:18.715
Which one has more evidence?

01:04:18.715 --> 01:04:21.203
- The latest status of
the Out of Africa theory.

01:04:22.608 --> 01:04:25.370
Well, there's a general
consensus that that's right

01:04:25.370 --> 01:04:29.170
and this components
analysis that I showed you

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:35.170
underpins that, so I'd say that's right.

01:04:35.170 --> 01:04:37.430
It's a big difference between saying

01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:38.730
that's the general consensus

01:04:38.730 --> 01:04:40.240
of people who work in the field

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:43.930
and saying that it's somehow
proven as the night, the day.

01:04:43.930 --> 01:04:47.493
That's another issue, but
that's the general status, yes.

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:50.720
To answer about Out of Africa,

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.433
I should make a remark.

01:04:53.450 --> 01:04:57.210
I believe that human ancestors originally

01:04:57.210 --> 01:04:59.320
differentiating came out of Africa,

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:02.020
but I haven't the faintest
idea what they looked like.

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:05.330
Look, it's very important.

01:05:05.330 --> 01:05:06.910
They may have come Out of Africa

01:05:06.910 --> 01:05:09.050
but that doesn't say they were black.

01:05:09.050 --> 01:05:10.580
For all I know they looked like Arabs,

01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:12.400
or they looked like
something we've never seen.

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:14.260
I mean, we don't have the faintest idea

01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:16.170
what they looked like,
because if the theory

01:05:16.170 --> 01:05:18.560
of sexual selection is right,

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:21.580
this differentiation of skin
color and hair form and so on

01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:23.600
is something that occurred subsequently

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:26.270
or during the process,
and tells us nothing

01:05:26.270 --> 01:05:28.700
about what our Aboriginal
ancestors looked like.

01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:31.073
But they did apparently
come Out of Africa, yes.

01:05:31.950 --> 01:05:32.840
- [Audience Member] One more.

01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:36.440
I was watching Journey of
Man by Dr. Spencer Wells.

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:37.273
- Yeah.

01:05:37.273 --> 01:05:39.653
- [Audience Member] So according to him

01:05:39.653 --> 01:05:42.920
there is this group of Kalihari Bushmen

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:46.070
who are supposed to be the original group.

01:05:46.070 --> 01:05:48.325
So what do you think,
what's your take on that?

01:05:48.325 --> 01:05:51.357
- Well, I don't have a
professional opinion on that.

01:05:51.357 --> 01:05:53.950
I should confess that Spencer Wells

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:55.750
was my graduate student,

01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:58.540
and therefore I'm not perhaps capable

01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:00.633
of giving an objective opinion.

01:06:00.633 --> 01:06:02.230
(audience laughing)

01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:03.830
I'll say nothing more than that.

01:06:05.890 --> 01:06:07.550
Don't get the wrong idea.

01:06:07.550 --> 01:06:12.003
But the Kalahari people
are a special case,

01:06:12.003 --> 01:06:13.570
are a kind of special case

01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:15.420
which we have to be very cautious of.

01:06:16.575 --> 01:06:19.421
Most of the people like the Kalahari

01:06:19.421 --> 01:06:23.890
are people who apparently
have been pushed out

01:06:23.890 --> 01:06:27.280
by more powerful groups from
a different sort of life,

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:30.080
and marginalized, and
live a marginal existence.

01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:31.260
That was almost certainly true

01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:32.683
for the people of Patagonia,

01:06:33.895 --> 01:06:37.120
of the extreme south around Cape Horn,

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:39.850
of the Kalahari, indeed of the Berbers,

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:45.880
the desert-dwelling, pastoral
people of the Near EAst

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:49.560
who, if one believes Ibn Khaldun,

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:53.168
were repeatedly extruded
and then conquered

01:06:53.168 --> 01:06:54.940
and then extruded and conquered.

01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:58.180
So I'm rather loath to come to conclusions

01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:00.470
about evolution from groups

01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:04.280
who have been somewhat recently,

01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:06.170
we don't know how recently,

01:07:06.170 --> 01:07:08.100
were originally part of another population

01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:11.563
and then shoved out in small numbers.

01:07:12.544 --> 01:07:14.430
I think it's dangerous to make

01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:17.842
too many conclusions from that, okay?

01:07:17.842 --> 01:07:20.580
- [Audience Member] Thank you.

01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:22.030
- [Audience Member] In your final slide,

01:07:22.030 --> 01:07:24.660
the upper map was principal component one

01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:27.290
that is consistent with the
Out of Africa hypothesis,

01:07:27.290 --> 01:07:28.920
but the lower map, I'm wondering

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:30.470
if that's principal component two.

01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:31.303
- It is.

01:07:31.303 --> 01:07:32.410
- [Audience Member] And I'm wondering that

01:07:32.410 --> 01:07:34.300
there was a line across
Africa at the Sahara,

01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:36.730
there's a line across
Eurasia at the Urals,

01:07:36.730 --> 01:07:39.410
and that would seem to suggest
that the primary signal

01:07:39.410 --> 01:07:41.940
in human genetics is out of Africa

01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:43.650
and the colonization of the planet.

01:07:43.650 --> 01:07:45.050
But the next strongest signal

01:07:45.050 --> 01:07:46.980
is the regional differentiation?

01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:49.530
- Absolutely, I mean you're
quite right about that.

01:07:50.450 --> 01:07:53.731
For this particular
purpose I can't go into

01:07:53.731 --> 01:07:54.927
the difference between the first

01:07:54.927 --> 01:07:56.530
and the second principal component,

01:07:56.530 --> 01:07:59.810
but what you say I think
people should listen to.

01:07:59.810 --> 01:08:01.240
- [Audience Member] All right.

01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:03.950
(audience laughing)

01:08:03.950 --> 01:08:04.900
- [Audience Member] You may be familiar

01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:07.460
with the Affymetrix GeneChip platform.

01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:09.830
Are you familiar with any new studies

01:08:09.830 --> 01:08:12.010
that look at gene expression analysis

01:08:12.010 --> 01:08:14.500
on top of just gene differentiation?

01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:16.850
- No, I'm not, I'm sorry.

01:08:16.850 --> 01:08:19.790
I mean, I'm familiar with
the Affymetrix GeneChip

01:08:19.790 --> 01:08:21.630
but perhaps you want to
say something about that.

01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:23.800
- [Audience Member] No, do you feel

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:25.230
knowing about that technology,

01:08:25.230 --> 01:08:27.340
do you think that that may reveal

01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:30.988
more information about this subject?

01:08:30.988 --> 01:08:32.988
- Well, the trouble with gene expression

01:08:33.872 --> 01:08:37.943
is that expression patterns are embedded

01:08:39.230 --> 01:08:43.110
in a network of signaling,
of expression signaling

01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:44.730
which would be very difficult

01:08:44.730 --> 01:08:47.930
to interpret in the way we need to.

01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:50.660
That is, say, we might have a
different expression pattern

01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:51.950
in one group than another

01:08:53.477 --> 01:08:56.470
because one gene is being
expressed differently

01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:58.120
and that's having a downstream effect

01:08:58.120 --> 01:08:59.653
on the expression of others.

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:04.746
So I'm not saying that expression patterns

01:09:04.746 --> 01:09:06.600
will not be of any interest,

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:10.750
but I think their
interpretation is subject

01:09:10.750 --> 01:09:13.550
to the serious complexity

01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:17.460
of the patterns of expression induction.

01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:22.460
And I don't know exactly
how to interpret them

01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:24.390
is the problem.

01:09:24.390 --> 01:09:26.520
For example, I don't know,

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:28.910
somebody can tell us
because they could look,

01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:30.930
what the effect on gene
expression patterns

01:09:30.930 --> 01:09:33.240
of all kinds is of people who have,

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:36.380
say, sickle cell anemia as opposed

01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:37.990
to not sickle cell anemia.

01:09:37.990 --> 01:09:39.730
Does that have consequences in other parts

01:09:39.730 --> 01:09:40.830
of the gene expression pattern?

01:09:40.830 --> 01:09:41.800
I don't know the answer.

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:42.763
You could find out.

01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:45.550
But I think one has to do that

01:09:45.550 --> 01:09:47.260
because of the epistatic interactions

01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:50.200
between gene expression patterns.

01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:51.500
That's the best I can say.

01:09:52.710 --> 01:09:55.300
- [Audience Member] Hi, I thought
the sexual selection story

01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:56.990
that you gave at the end
was very interesting.

01:09:56.990 --> 01:09:59.910
I had never heard that before with people.

01:09:59.910 --> 01:10:02.140
And I was wondering what you think

01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:06.150
would be an ideal test to test
the sexual selection story

01:10:06.150 --> 01:10:09.840
versus a non-sexual
natural selection story

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:11.710
such as the one that you mentioned

01:10:11.710 --> 01:10:15.789
about vitamin D and cancer,
short of time travel.

01:10:15.789 --> 01:10:18.560
- I don't know the
answer to that question.

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:20.650
Monty, have you got an answer to that?

01:10:20.650 --> 01:10:22.380
How I could distinguish sexual selection

01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:24.580
from what we usually
call natural selection?

01:10:26.110 --> 01:10:27.560
It doesn't seem obvious to me

01:10:28.512 --> 01:10:30.320
because the difference
is not a statistical

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:31.740
or mechanical difference,

01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:34.090
it's a difference in causation

01:10:34.090 --> 01:10:36.030
which has the same influence on the fact

01:10:36.030 --> 01:10:38.990
that some types have more
offspring than others

01:10:38.990 --> 01:10:42.110
and the various statistical tests one does

01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:44.340
doesn't ask why do some types

01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:45.630
have more offspring than others,

01:10:45.630 --> 01:10:47.070
it only presents evidence that some types

01:10:47.070 --> 01:10:48.820
do have more offspring than others.

01:10:49.670 --> 01:10:51.160
The differentiation natural selection

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:53.610
and sexual selection is
in the engineering story

01:10:53.610 --> 01:10:56.740
you'd tell, and that's
a physiological story

01:10:56.740 --> 01:10:59.420
which is not revealed by
patterns of gene frequency.

01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:01.510
So I guess the reason that even Monty

01:11:01.510 --> 01:11:04.223
can't answer it is because
it doesn't have an answer.

01:11:05.170 --> 01:11:06.230
No, no, I'm serious about that.

01:11:06.230 --> 01:11:08.900
I mean, you have to understand
that sexual selection

01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:13.900
does not differ in its dynamics from,

01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:16.100
or kinetics from other kinds of selection.

01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:18.460
It's just a different
kind of causal story.

01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:20.280
It still lines up that some people

01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:21.740
have a lot more offspring than others,

01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:24.440
and certain genotypes have
more offspring than others.

01:11:28.370 --> 01:11:29.260
- [Audience Member] Two questions.

01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:32.430
First, what is your
perspective on hybrid vigor?

01:11:32.430 --> 01:11:35.310
And secondly, what do you think about

01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:37.993
this whole idea of they're not,

01:11:38.935 --> 01:11:43.680
the surface meaning does
not have this deeper meaning

01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:45.310
and what are the implications for--

01:11:45.310 --> 01:11:47.350
- I'm sorry, what was the second question?

01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:48.280
- [Audience Member] The whole idea about

01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:50.460
the surface differences really don't have

01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:53.220
these deeper meanings that we sometimes

01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:55.420
in the lay public apply to them,

01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:58.145
and how do you speculate your information?

01:11:58.145 --> 01:12:00.490
What effect do you think it will have

01:12:00.490 --> 01:12:03.460
on the lay public, which sometimes care,

01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:06.250
want to perpetuate this notion

01:12:06.250 --> 01:12:09.940
of racial prejudice and so forth?

01:12:09.940 --> 01:12:11.410
- Well, the answer to the first one

01:12:11.410 --> 01:12:13.473
as far as hybrid vigor is concerned,

01:12:15.570 --> 01:12:17.473
there's no evidence of hybrid vigor.

01:12:19.426 --> 01:12:22.310
Indeed, there's no evidence
of hybrid vigor in corn.

01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:23.690
I mean, I could give a whole lecture

01:12:23.690 --> 01:12:26.380
on the nonsense about
hybrid vigor in corn.

01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:28.540
The hybridization in corn is a gimmick

01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:31.143
to guarantee property
rights to seed companies.

01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:34.710
We could produce corn as productive

01:12:34.710 --> 01:12:36.800
as hybrid corn by mass selection.

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:38.800
That's well known, that's not a problem.

01:12:39.810 --> 01:12:42.560
So to try to carry over
the claim of hybrid vigor

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:45.290
from corn to people, if
that's what you're asking,

01:12:45.290 --> 01:12:47.340
whether people who are
the result of matings

01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:49.963
between distant groups
will somehow be better,

01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:54.560
we have no proof it couldn't exist

01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:56.130
but we have no evidence for it.

01:12:56.130 --> 01:12:58.650
Now one thing that does
happen is if you mate

01:12:59.690 --> 01:13:04.080
between people who have as differentiated

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:05.994
gene groups as possible,

01:13:05.994 --> 01:13:10.994
you may cover up certain
deleterious recessive genes.

01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:13.400
That may happen, but I don't think

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:15.530
that's what you're really asking.

01:13:15.530 --> 01:13:17.928
And one more.

01:13:17.928 --> 01:13:20.463
No, no, let me finish my answer to her.

01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:26.610
As far as what effect
this has on the attitudes

01:13:26.610 --> 01:13:29.573
of people toward superiority
of one race or another,

01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:32.810
it's not clear it has any effect

01:13:32.810 --> 01:13:37.810
because, as I said, the fact
that 85% of the variation

01:13:38.010 --> 01:13:40.720
is within a local group
and so little of it between

01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:44.261
doesn't prove that the
genes that really matter

01:13:44.261 --> 01:13:46.500
are highly differentiated between groups.

01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:47.940
I could always say, yeah but what about

01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:48.923
that small percent?

01:13:49.810 --> 01:13:52.000
You haven't told me
about the genes for IQ,

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.768
the genes for charity, and if I want

01:13:54.768 --> 01:13:57.580
for some ideological reason to claim

01:13:57.580 --> 01:14:00.773
that there are those, I haven't
proved they don't exist.

01:14:01.952 --> 01:14:04.270
So I think data like these

01:14:06.050 --> 01:14:11.010
in large part predispose
one toward an understanding

01:14:11.010 --> 01:14:13.910
of the situation, but if
you're a hardcore racist

01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:15.883
they're not gonna have any effect at all.

01:14:17.310 --> 01:14:19.486
- [Audience Member] Thank you very much.

01:14:19.486 --> 01:14:22.653
(audience applauding)

01:14:26.132 --> 01:14:28.715
(upbeat music)
