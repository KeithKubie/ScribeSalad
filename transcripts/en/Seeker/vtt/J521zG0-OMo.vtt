00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.980
When it comes to space colonization, Mars
is at the forefront of modern exploration.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.080
Meanwhile, our nearest celestial neighbor
- the Moon - is seemingly overlooked.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:17.130
And that's, in part, because the Moon isn't
exactly a haven for humanity.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.120
The lunar surface is covered with dead volcanoes,
massive craters and potentially poisonous dust.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.840
It's also constantly bombarded by space rocks
raining down on its surface due to its very

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.880
thin and weak atmosphere known as an exosphere.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.700
On top of that, this ultra thin layer of gases

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.360
doesn't provide any protection from the sun's radiation.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.040
But some scientists believe this wasn't always the case.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.820
Recent NASA findings show that there might
have been a time when the Moon had a prominent

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:53.170
atmosphere, and it could make the Moon a stronger contender for colonization.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.400
Billions of years ago, after the formation
of the inner solar system, it's believed,

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.320
that the young planets and the moon were pummeled
by space rocks

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.840
and other leftover planet-building material.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.109
The period known as the Late Heavy Bombardment
or LBH is thought to have lasted millions

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:13.189
of years, and damage from this violent period
was seen in craters on some of the inner planets

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:14.579
and the Moon.

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:19.159
There, the LBH triggered a series of volcanic
eruptions.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.860
Lava filled the lunar craters, creating seas
that stretched

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.980
for hundreds of kilometers across its surface.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.279
During this period, it's thought that the
lunar lava emitted gas components or volatiles

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.440
like carbon monoxide, sulfur, hydrogen and
oxygen.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.679
As the lava spread, the volatiles accumulated
and formed a transient atmosphere.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.060
The ancient atmosphere was believed to be
much thinner than Earth's current atmosphere,

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.080
but 1.5 times thicker than Mars' current atmosphere.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.689
The eruptions lasted for about 70 million
years, and it's estimated that trillions of

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:56.270
gallons of water was released during this period.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.130
As the atmosphere started to thin out, the
volatiles were either lost to space or became

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.659
part of the surface of the Moon.

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.570
Researchers believe it's possible that a significant
amount of water may have made its way to the

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.489
lunar poles and could be trapped in permanently
shadowed regions.

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.349
In fact, NASA's new analysis quantifies a
source of volatiles based on lunar samples

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.790
collected during the Apollo missions.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.940
And these volatiles could provide key resources
- like water, air and fuel

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.920
- for extended moon missions and beyond.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.500
So while Mars is still a frontrunner when
it comes to colonization, revelations about

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.689
the Moon's past and its potential presence
of water continue to prove that there is still

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:40.400
a lot more lunar exploration needed before
we count the Moon out.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.780
