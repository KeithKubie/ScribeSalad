00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:04.250
Let's review what we went over
in the last video, and one of

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.010
you all actually commented that
it would be a good idea

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:06.950
to draw a timeline.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.780
So I'll draw a timeline.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.080
Short.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.740
So we're learning about
short selling.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.150
And in the last example-- let
me do the timeline where

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.060
things work out well for
the short seller.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.910
So let me draw the stock
price of IBM.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.410
Let me make this its--
OK, here we go.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.970
So let's say that this is-- that
could be our timeline,

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.000
it's by day.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.170
Let me draw the stock of IBM, it
could look something like--

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.030
that's my y-axis.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.800
Let's say the stock right now
is at $100, it's trading

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.260
someplace like that.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.900
And let's say it does
that later, right?

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.910
But we're sitting at this
point right here-- we're

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.980
sitting at, let's
call this day 0.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.130
So what does the short
seller do?

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.870
So let's say the short seller,
right now-- let me see if I

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.270
can draw his balance sheet.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.959
So right now, the short seller,
he has assets and

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:06.209
liabilities.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.100
His assets-- I won't worry about
collateral requirements

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.050
and all of that right now.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.560
But usually he already has to
have some assets ahead of time

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.890
for him to be able
to borrow shares.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.400
But, actually-- let
me give him some

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.250
collateral ahead of time.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.430
So let's say that he already
has $60 in his account.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.320
He has $60 of assets on day 0.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.210
And then this is the day that
he says, you know what?

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.560
I've done my analysis and I
think IBM-- he doesn't see

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.400
this part of the stock price,
I mean, it would

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.200
be great if he did.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.710
Then you could short
with conviction.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.440
But all he sees is
the past, right?

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.450
If he did a stock chart he would
just see-- let me switch

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.220
colors-- he would just see this
green part right here.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.000
He wouldn't see all the stuff
that's in the future.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.480
But he has a lot of conviction
that IBM is going to go down.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.230
So what he does is, he borrows
a share of IBM on that day.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.690
So then on this day he
borrows one share.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.480
So he has-- let's call
that IBM-- one IBM.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.970
And he also owes one IBM.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.890
Right?

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.070
Right after you borrow it,
before you do anything into

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.810
it, you have it as an asset,
and you also owe it back.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.900
And if you wanted unwind the
borrowing of it, you could

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.070
just give it back.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.440
But what he does at this point
is he sells this IBM.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.530
He sells that share and
he gets $100 for it.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.880
Because that was just
the market price.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.010
That's what people were willing
to trade IBM shares

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.660
for at that point in time.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.350
That's day 0.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.690
Then let's say IBM reports
its earnings, and

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.880
they're really bad.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.750
And that happened on, I
don't know, probably

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.230
happened on this day.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.480
IBM reports.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.710
And the stock tends to
go down, down, down.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.300
People take a long time
to realize how

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.380
bad the report was.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.200
And here at this day, once the
stock has reached $50, our

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.150
short seller says OK,
that's enough.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.140
I don't think the stock's going
to drop a lot more.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.640
So on day-- let's call
this day 10.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.360
10 days have gone by.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.740
Day 10, he decides to cover.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.710
So going into day 10, this
is his balance sheet--

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.630
let me redraw it.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.630
So going in to day 10,
what does he have?

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.900
He has $160.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.290
The $60 he had before, just
by actually working.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.330
And he owes-- this is his asset,
and his liabilities is

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.010
he owes one share of
IBM to the broker.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.560
And the broker really owes it to
one of the shareholders of

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.760
IBM who happened to be keeping
the share with the broker.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.170
And he wants to cover.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:55.510
So what he does is, he takes
$100-- no, no sorry, he

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.360
doesn't take $100.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.630
Now shares of IBM only
cost $50, right?

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:05.220
So he takes $50 to buy a
share, to buy one IBM.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.200
So instead of $160, he
now has $110 and he

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.510
has a share of IBM.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.650
And then what he does is, he
takes this share of IBM and

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.480
then gives it to the brokerage
to pay off his liability.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.430
So then he's done.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.090
He's left with no liabilities,
and just $110 of assets.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.620
So he made $50.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.730
So hopefully that clarifies it
up a little bit, in that he

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.530
sold here, and bought here.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.770
It's the reverse of a lot of
stock, it's almost like you're

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.290
acting in reverse time.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.020
But this was a very good
scenario for the short seller.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.630
But he very easily could
have made a blunder.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.790
Let's see what could have been
a blunderous scenario.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.610
Let me draw a different
stock chart for IBM.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.390
So let me draw the stock up to
the day in question, and we

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.570
said it was looking something
like this, where it was

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.640
trading right at around $100.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.906
And this is the day that our
short seller decides to short

00:05:02.906 --> 00:05:04.280
it, and this happens.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.820
Right?

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.380
He essentially borrows
a share of IBM.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.730
So he has a one IBM
share liability.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.980
He sells that share and
he collects $100.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:20.805
And then let's say IBM reports
on this day, so this is day 0.

00:05:20.805 --> 00:05:23.010
Now IBM reports, and it's
actually great.

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.700
They did way better than anyone
could have expected.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.370
So then the IBM shares
skyrocket, and

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:29.565
they go to this level.

00:05:29.565 --> 00:05:33.290
And at this point this-- and
I'll talk more about short

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.680
psychology and short squeezing,
and all that-- but

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.640
maybe here he's like, oh no,
this is just a temporary blip,

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.260
let me keep holding
my position.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.680
But then the stock keeps going
up and up and he says oh, this

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.250
is just temporary, it's
going to go back down.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.240
But at some point, his tolerance
for pain has been

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.060
tapped out.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.790
And let's say IBM
gets to $150.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.730
He says, I can't handle
this anymore.

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:54.820
And I think you're already
noticing a very negative

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.570
dynamic or a highly risky
dynamic that occurs with

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.630
shorts, is that you can lose an
arbitrary amount of money.

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:01.690
Because what's happening now?

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.450
Let's say he wants to
cover it right now.

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:08.090
This is day 10 in this
alternate universe.

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.690
So now, what are his assets
and his liabilities?

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:17.910
Going in to day 10, his asset,
we said, was $160.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.690
Because he had short
sold, he had $160.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.660
But he owes one share of IBM.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.000
For him to unwind this, to pay
back the share of IBM, what

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.390
does he have to do?

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.670
He has to go out into the market
and buy a share of IBM

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.790
at this higher price, at $150.

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:41.000
So when he goes out, instead of
$160 he has to use 100-- so

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.640
he has $10-- and then he uses
$150 of that to go buy-- $150

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.520
of the $160 to buy
a share of IBM.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.920
So then he gets a
share of IBM.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.520
And then he can pay that share
back to the broker and cancel

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.600
out his position.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.250
And he's left with just $10.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:05.080
So in this scenario when
the stock price rose by

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.840
$50, he lost $50.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:15.850
So he sold low and then
he bought high, right?

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.390
And the really risky thing that
maybe is apparent to you

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.640
now about short selling
is that his loss

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.280
could have been infinite.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.030
What if IBM, instead of going to
$150, what if went to $200?

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:28.060
Then he would have lost $200--
if it went to $200, he would

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.900
have lost $100.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.230
If it went to $300, he
would have lost $200.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.220
So his loss isn't just
the amount of the

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.370
original short position.

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:40.620
It isn't just the $100 or
whatever the original

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:41.730
price of IBM was.

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:45.190
It can be an infinite amount,
so it really can kill your

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:45.730
balance sheet.

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.180
Or really make you broke.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.190
While when you go in the long
side of things, if I were to

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.130
buy IBM here.

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:55.910
Let's say I'm the guy that
bought this share from the

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:56.900
short seller.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.260
What's my worst case scenario?

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.740
Well the worst thing I can have
happen is that the share

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:01.890
of IBM goes to 0.

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:04.800
So my loss is really,
I can just go to 0.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.480
I won't end up owing someone an
infinite amount of money.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.870
So short selling, inherently,
because of this infinite, you

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.880
could say downside to the
short seller, right?

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.070
They can lose an infinite
amount of money.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:19.370
They have to be really careful
about how they make their

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:22.760
positions and how they protect
themselves from this

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:23.740
eventuality.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.610
And we'll talk a little bit
about things like margin

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.100
requirements and things like
that in the future, that

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:33.260
essentially make sure-- are
the broker's way of making

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:39.080
sure that the short seller can
actually-- is good to buy back

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.039
the shares.

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:42.419
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
