00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.550
again I don't know if I needed something
to push him to do it because that was

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560
to push him to do it because that was
 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.839
to push him to do it because that was
the one thing I was like wait why is he

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:00.849

suddenly talking to him again why is he

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449
suddenly talking to him again why is he
 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:07.110

you have when he was given the silent

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740
you have when he was given the silent
 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.270
you have when he was given the silent
treatment for so long uh but I'm not

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280
treatment for so long uh but I'm not
 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.020

that bothered I think the reason is that

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030
that bothered I think the reason is that
 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.219
that bothered I think the reason is that
why do people give the silent treatment

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:17.229
why do people give the silent treatment
 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:20.610
why do people give the silent treatment
to begin with because well it's one of

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620
to begin with because well it's one of
 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.620
to begin with because well it's one of
two reasons one either the person giving

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630
two reasons one either the person giving
 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.029
two reasons one either the person giving
the silent treatment is very emotional

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039
the silent treatment is very emotional
 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:26.520
the silent treatment is very emotional
and just can't talk to them or they're

and just can't talk to them or they're
 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.800
and just can't talk to them or they're
doing it because they know the other

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810
doing it because they know the other
 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.890
doing it because they know the other
person needs that they need and I think

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900
person needs that they need and I think
 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.050
person needs that they need and I think

I I can't get this right and he has to
know that he really has gone too far to

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110
know that he really has gone too far to
 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.469
know that he really has gone too far to
a point where he won't even respond but

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479
a point where he won't even respond but
 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:49.140
a point where he won't even respond but
and he has to sit with himself he has to

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150
and he has to sit with himself he has to
 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.120
and he has to sit with himself he has to
sit with his thoughts and he has to

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130
sit with his thoughts and he has to
 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.490
sit with his thoughts and he has to
really analyze what is going on and what

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500
really analyze what is going on and what
 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.879
really analyze what is going on and what
does he want and what does he need and I

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:56.889
does he want and what does he need and I
 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.010

think before where the uncle did give

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020
think before where the uncle did give
 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.560
think before where the uncle did give
him a little bit of space he still

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570
him a little bit of space he still
 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.779
him a little bit of space he still
followed we they met up again in the

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:03.789
followed we they met up again in the
 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:08.060
followed we they met up again in the
chase episode and there's a very

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070
chase episode and there's a very
 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.890
chase episode and there's a very
possible chance maybe that wasn't the

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:10.900
possible chance maybe that wasn't the
 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.560
possible chance maybe that wasn't the
right thing to do and I think the uncle

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:13.570
right thing to do and I think the uncle
 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.899
right thing to do and I think the uncle
might have realized that so I think he

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:15.909
might have realized that so I think he
 

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:17.310
might have realized that so I think he
knows here that he wants to give him a

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320
knows here that he wants to give him a
 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.020
knows here that he wants to give him a
little bit more distance and he has to

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.030
little bit more distance and he has to
 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.200
little bit more distance and he has to
be alone with his pain because he made a

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210
be alone with his pain because he made a
 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.129
be alone with his pain because he made a
really tough bad choice that he has to

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:26.139
really tough bad choice that he has to
 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:27.420
really tough bad choice that he has to
live with it for a bit

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:27.430
live with it for a bit
 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.120
