[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:07.690
SACHIT EGAN: I'm
really excited today

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.840
to introduce a new friend
of mine, Carine McCandless.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.170
She's the sister of literary
icon Christopher McCandless

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.360
and she consulted
closely with Jon Krakauer

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.250
on his bestselling
book, "Into the Wild,"

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.630
which came out in 1996.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.270
I'm sure a lot of you have
heard of it or read it.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.940
She also worked as a direct
adviser, writer, and script

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.730
contributor to Sean Penn
on his film adaptation

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.450
of "Into the Wild," which
was released in 2007.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.060
Carine wrote her own
memoir about the experience

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.160
called "The Wild Truth."

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.810
That was released
in November 2014

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.480
and very quickly became
both a New York Times

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.420
and national bestseller.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.530
And it was followed by
international publications

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.150
in seven countries
and still counting.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.500
"The Wild Truth" was
selected for many best books

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.310
of 2014 lists, including those
chosen by readers and editors

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.580
at "Newsweek," "Vanity
Fair," Amazon, and Indy Next.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.146
So it's a pleasure
to introduce Carine.

00:00:59.146 --> 00:01:02.074
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.390
CARINE MCCANDLESS: I thank you
all for hosting me here today.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.510
I'll keep things pretty casual.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.890
I've got my journal.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.560
Everyone should always write
in a journal every day.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:22.300
I had to put markers in
mine of the Google color

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.460
and your logo to remind
me where in the journal

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.840
I needed to go back to.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.440
So anyway, I'm used to
doing very, very long

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.344
and formal presentations
so I've got my journal here

00:01:32.344 --> 00:01:34.510
to help me stay on point
because I really would like

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.022
to get some time at the
end of this to get into Q&amp;A

00:01:38.022 --> 00:01:38.605
with you guys.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:48.000
So when I was 21, I
lost my best friend.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.860
He was also my brother.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.010
He was 24 when he died.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.860
And many of you know the story.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.980
His name was Chris McCandless.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.630
He had graduated with
honors from Emory University

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:15.230
and that was the last time
that I had ever seen him alive,

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.530
it was the last time I'd spoken.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.620
He had written me letters,
but I hadn't spoken to him

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.590
since seeing him at graduation.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.542
Two years later,
his body was found

00:02:30.542 --> 00:02:32.000
in this abandoned
bus in the middle

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.590
of the Alaskan wilderness.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.382
There was a lot of
mystery surrounding

00:02:37.382 --> 00:02:39.840
his death and everything that
had happened during those two

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.340
years.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.490
And the story of that time
and all of the adventures

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.510
that he had during
that time became

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.260
known as "Into
the Wild," as such

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.940
summarized the incredible
book written by Jon Krakauer.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.660
And then it was also developed
into a film by Sean Penn.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.970
And Chris' story really became--

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.160
I mean, John's book
was so popular it's

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.340
published in over 30 languages.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.300
Sean's movie, also so
beautiful, and Chris' story

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.020
reached even more of
a global audience.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.930
But it wasn't the whole story.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.790
So to give you a
little back story,

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.580
this is Chris with the
Shenandoah behind him.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.710
We used to hike a lot--
this is my hiking hat--

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.990
in that area.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.940
And he loves to
be out in nature.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.700
Chris always said
to me that nature

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.770
may be harsh in its honesty,
but it never lies to you.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:53.490
And he felt--

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.120
I don't know, he felt
whole, he felt real

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.340
when he was out in nature.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.070
And I just remember it was
always his favorite place

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.680
to be.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.160
It was always an escape for
him, even at this young age.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.700
Chris and I were very close.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.920
He was always my protector.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.250
It's a cute picture, right?

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.750
All right.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.000
This picture tells a story.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.590
This picture was taken
on a typical morning.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.640
Our house was on an
everyday basis filled

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:45.740
with domestic violence and this
day was not unlike any other.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.770
The violence had erupted
over the breakfast table

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.520
and continued on until
my parents realized

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.700
that it was time for church.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.774
It was Easter Sunday so
we were put into our best

00:04:55.774 --> 00:04:57.190
suit and dress and
we were marched

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.930
into the backyard for pictures.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:13.910
And pictures, they catch
an image in time, right,

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.230
but you don't really
know what's going on.

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.050
You don't know the whole
story behind the image.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.730
And whenever we
would have to pause

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:31.310
for the perfect little
family pictures,

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.430
our dad would behind the
camera screaming at us smile.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.250
Smile.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.820
So what we had just been
through in the household,

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.440
really not in the mood
but you had to do it.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.390
And if you didn't, I knew
what was coming next.

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:48.540
Now, look closely at our
expressions in these pictures.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:53.640
So I'm being compliant,
I've got a smile on my face.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.230
I've got my hand
behind his back,

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:01.470
I'm trying to convince Chris
smile, let's get this done.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.490
And look at the look on his
face if you really look closely.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.310
He's only about
six years old here,

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.560
but he's already
older than that.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.910
He already understands.

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.910
Now, what's really important
about this picture--

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:17.379
I've got it on the
cover of my book

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:19.420
because people look at
that and they're like, oh,

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.280
that's such a sweet picture.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.710
But again, it's the point of
the story behind the images

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.360
that we see, right?

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.220
That's what this whole
talk is going to be about.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:38.030
And I can remember it
like it was yesterday.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:41.510
You have this image that
you're going to portray out

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:45.230
to society, but sometimes
it's so very different

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.420
from what is actually going on.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:56.750
So Chris just, even at that age
he wasn't going to accept that.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:02.270
He was already planning.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.840
He was already at
that young age making

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.510
a determination of what's
right and what's wrong.

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:12.260
When you grow up in a
household of domestic violence,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.090
you become acclimated to it.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:16.940
You don't know at this
age that every household

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.650
isn't like that.

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.120
You don't understand.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.260
So when your environment
is saturated with that,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.590
you become completely
desensitized to it.

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:30.590
Chris understood
something was wrong.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:38.420
Now, as we grew up,
in a lot of ways

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:40.970
Chris was your typical
kid, but in other ways

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.310
there was just
something about him

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:47.750
that I don't know you could
say was deeper than most people

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:49.080
at that age.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.830
And sometimes we would
just be having typical kid

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:56.730
conversations or we would be
fighting over that's my space

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:00.130
or don't come in my room,
but other times we'd

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:03.210
be having these conversations
about an author or something

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:07.980
that he just read that he wanted
me to read or big questions

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.440
and I was more interested
in the stuffed animals

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.140
at that age or makeup
at a later age.

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.250
Chris was different.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.650
At this age, he was
already thinking

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:24.380
a lot about who he
wanted to be and probably

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:27.290
most importantly, who
he would not become.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:36.304
So John's book became
required reading.

00:08:36.304 --> 00:08:37.929
"Into the Wild" became
required reading

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:40.330
at about 3,000 high
schools and colleges

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.549
across the United States.

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:44.450
John doesn't like to
do public speaking

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:47.320
so he would suggest me.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.770
And it took me a very,
very, very long time

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:55.780
to get to the point where I felt
comfortable going and speaking

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:59.550
to people about Chris' story.

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:04.910
And when I did, I would
be talking to students

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:06.570
who are about this age.

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:10.130
This is Chris' typical senior
picture in high school, right?

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:13.520
And when I came
to the school, you

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.020
would see a change
in these students

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:19.510
because it became real to them.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:21.190
It was no longer
just an assignment,

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:23.890
it was this lesson because
this is a real flesh and blood

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:26.400
sister of this person.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:32.000
And it wasn't just that
I could see that they

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.377
were inspired by Chris.

00:09:34.377 --> 00:09:35.960
There's usually two
camps, some people

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.330
admired him for what he did,
some people admonished him.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:39.788
That's part of the
reason that it's

00:09:39.788 --> 00:09:42.290
something that's assigned,
right, because they want people

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:44.570
to get into that
critical kind of thinking

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:46.710
and think outside of themselves.

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:54.085
But what hit me more was that
I never left one school--

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:59.196
first of all, they always
asked about the back story,

00:09:59.196 --> 00:10:01.570
right, which at first I wasn't
necessarily talking about.

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:04.337
But in the Q&amp;A, that's always
what the questions were--

00:10:04.337 --> 00:10:05.920
why was he so angry
with your parents,

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.140
why did he leave the way
he did, why didn't he

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:11.830
talk to anybody for those
years after he left college?

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:15.340
And when I opened up in the
safety of the intimate walls

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:20.850
of a classroom where things
weren't recorded yet,

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:24.270
I saw this change come
over the students,

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:25.470
and some in particular.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:29.087
Because I never left one
school, and still to this day

00:10:29.087 --> 00:10:30.670
all the years that
I've been speaking,

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:34.800
I've never left one school, one
university a corporate event,

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:39.060
I've never left anywhere where
at least one person didn't

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.282
come up.

00:10:40.282 --> 00:10:42.840
And in this case, it was
these high school students

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:47.240
that didn't come up and ask for
help for the very first time

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.950
because they were going
through a similar experience

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:54.400
and here was someone
talking about it.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:11:02.720
So after years of doing this and
seeing this everywhere I went,

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.926
I realized what a disservice
I had done to my brother--

00:11:06.926 --> 00:11:09.300
and not just to Chris, but
those who would read about him

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:10.350
and be inspired by him.

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:12.660
Because Chris always
said there is nothing

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.200
more important than the truth.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.770
And John did an job
writing "Into the Wild."

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:21.140
and what was left
out of it is my fault

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:24.800
because I wanted
John to understand,

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.700
but I wouldn't let
him write that.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.300
I wasn't ready.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:33.920
And I realized
later on, wow, what

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.230
a disservice I had done to
such an incredible writer

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:38.105
and someone with that
journalistic style, Jon

00:11:38.105 --> 00:11:40.687
Krakauer, to give
them information

00:11:40.687 --> 00:11:43.020
but tell him beforehand, I'm
going to tell you something

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:46.010
but my condition is you're
not allowed to reveal this.

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:47.510
I just need you to know.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:51.770
I didn't think anybody was
going to read "Into the Wild,"

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:58.220
so it's kind of Jon's
fault. So anyway, I

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:01.320
realized what a disservice I had
done by not talking about this.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.820
And here 20 years has passed.

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:07.240
So as I mentioned earlier,
I journal all the time.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.580
Chris was the one that
taught me to journal

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:11.840
and we'll get a little
bit more into that.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:15.300
But I just started writing.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:20.860
And all of those journal
entries turned into a book.

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:31.270
And what I didn't
expect was for my book

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:34.750
to start a new conversation
about domestic violence.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:36.910
There were all these
blanks in Chris' story

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:39.730
and people, rightfully
so, had filled

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:43.270
in those blanks with
their own answers

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:44.890
as to why he had
left the way he did

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:48.270
or what had happened
with the family.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:53.030
And when my book came out, or
long before the book came out--

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:57.560
just when I was in these rooms
of 50 people, 500 people,

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.060
it didn't matter--

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:01.640
when I would talk about
the rest of the story,

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:05.930
it forced people to take
another look at Chris' story.

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:08.360
Not in defense of him,
because in all fairness,

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.549
he didn't live his life worried
about what anyone else was

00:13:11.549 --> 00:13:12.590
going to think about him.

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:15.262
He was concerned about what
he thought about himself.

00:13:15.262 --> 00:13:21.460
But now that people had
the rest of the answers,

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:24.630
a lot of their
perspectives changed

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:28.860
and that was not
something that I realized

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:33.150
when I was 21 years
old and he was gone

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:40.050
and I was having to tell
this journalist why he left.

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:50.480
So people not only would take
another look at Chris' story,

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.430
but they started taking
another look at story

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:53.471
in their own communities.

00:13:53.471 --> 00:13:55.290
And I started doing
the same thing.

00:13:55.290 --> 00:14:03.230
So whenever I was
at these schools--

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:06.430
and for the most
part, these are--

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:09.780
if they're hiring
a speaker to come.

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:11.630
these schools are
filled with kids

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:15.860
who have a certain amount
of privilege, right?

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:18.620
They're all wearing pretty
nice clothes, when I pull up

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:21.277
to speak there's tons of
cars in the parking lot

00:14:21.277 --> 00:14:23.360
so pretty much all these
kids have access to cars,

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:30.960
they drive for school; they all
have phones, right, computers

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.040
and tablets.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:35.310
So they all want to connect
with me on social media

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:38.340
and I've never really been
big on having a social media

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:38.850
presence.

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:45.230
My publisher is so incredibly
kind and patient with me

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:49.640
for you're really supposed
to be on a lot and I'm not.

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.670
But I do try and make an effort.

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:55.490
And for the most
part, it's when I'm

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:57.414
connecting with these
students because I want

00:14:57.414 --> 00:14:58.580
to stay connected with them.

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:00.097
I want to see what
they're doing.

00:15:00.097 --> 00:15:02.180
I want to see what they're
doing with their lives.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:05.007
I want to hear what
they're doing next.

00:15:05.007 --> 00:15:06.590
Because they'll tell
me their stories.

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:08.548
They'll tell me how they
were inspired by Chris

00:15:08.548 --> 00:15:10.350
and what they want to do.

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:16.230
But as I am looking at the
social media of these kids

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:18.520
that I've connected with--

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.950
and these are good kids--

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:26.500
I'm also seeing all these other
stories, right, also good kids

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:30.340
but all these other pages and
connections that populate,

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:30.910
right?

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:32.320
So I don't have to tell you--

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.952
I'm at Google-- but you're
looking at social media

00:15:34.952 --> 00:15:36.410
and then someone
else has commented

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:37.960
and then that's curious so
I'm going to click on that,

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:38.650
I'm going to look at that.

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:40.816
And I think that kid might
have been at the lecture,

00:15:40.816 --> 00:15:41.890
let me look at that.

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:48.780
So I started to connect more
and more into the social media

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:51.270
and with this age group.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:53.430
And in paying more
attention to what

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:58.620
I saw through them, their
friends, their classmates,

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:03.480
I really began to see
something that concerned me.

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:11.190
There was a lot of good, but
there was also a lot of bad.

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:14.080
And to me, it appeared
that what I considered

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:19.610
to be a negative influence
and negative stimuli,

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:23.790
it was quite out of whack
i you look at the balance.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:31.300
And what I could see was there's
so much stimuli and reality

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.400
becomes a blur.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.990
There's just so much going on.

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:40.964
And that's what I
want to get into.

00:16:40.964 --> 00:16:43.130
Some of the things that I
started to see-- so I just

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:44.280
grabbed some screen shots.

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:48.832
I would look at
pages of students

00:16:48.832 --> 00:16:50.540
that I connected with
across the country,

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:53.630
but I also took a closer
look in my own community.

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:55.590
So I started looking at easy--

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:59.750
search the name of your
kid or your kids' friends

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:04.547
or all these kids go to the
high schools around the area.

00:17:04.547 --> 00:17:06.380
And these are some of
the things that I saw.

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:12.859
So here is one that's
got a few pictures

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:17.869
and it says, grab your
girl like this, right?

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:21.740
It's got I don't know what emoji
that is, a funny crying face

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.390
and then it's got
the hearts, right,

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:24.710
smiley face with the hearts.

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:28.700
It's got to have a name, I don't
know what that emoji is called.

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:32.100
But now let's take a closer
look at these four photos

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:33.570
that they have.

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:37.030
So no big deal, right-- don't
be an overprotective mom,

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:39.010
that's not a big deal, right?

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:39.900
It's just a little--

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:41.460
nothing graphic.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:42.960
So there's three of these shots.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.811
I guess it's cool that they
have cigarettes, whatever.

00:17:46.811 --> 00:17:47.310
All right.

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:48.643
And then this is the fourth one.

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.800
When I saw that, I
found that shocking.

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.840
Grab your girl like this.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:02.407
What I found more shocking was--

00:18:02.407 --> 00:18:03.990
and let's go back,
maybe it's on here.

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:07.490
OK.

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:08.250
Let's see.

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:11.840
There's 14-- now I'm watching
these things in real time.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.240
So this goes up and
then I'm watching it

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.820
over a matter of that day.

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:20.130
There's 1,400-- kind
of sucks getting old.

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:21.340
I need my reading glasses--

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:29.330
1,400 retweets and,
what, 1,372 likes.

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:32.840
What is there to
like about this?

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.680
What is there to
like about that?

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.460
All right.

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:40.210
So then I started
looking at more things.

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:46.400
And I saw this theme
and this pattern that

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.690
caused me a lot of concern.

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:52.840
So here's just another one.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:53.560
OK.

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.570
So this is a meme, right?

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:57.010
They call it a meme.

00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:01.830
So here's a skeleton getting
ready to punch a baby.

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:07.450
And it says, this is how infants
are killed during an abortion.

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:09.420
Now, I'm not here to talk
about abortion rights

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:10.890
or anything like that.

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:13.420
That's a whole
other topic, right?

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:17.530
But I think it's fair to say
that both sides of that issue

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:22.340
could agree that this
is inappropriate.

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:24.400
This is a skeleton
cold cocking a baby.

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:36.580
And again, you've
got 2,300 retweets,

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:39.860
almost 3,500 favorites.

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:41.260
Now, majority of
what I'm seeing,

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:45.520
these are school aged kids,
right, these are teenagers.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:50.110
This meme mentality
to me, they're

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:52.330
so separated from reality.

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:56.380
it's like everything's
a cartoon, not real.

00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:00.700
But that's a real issue, right?

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.970
And they don't know the
intent of the person that drew

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:06.380
this meme or posted it, right?

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:09.430
Are they saying that this is--

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:12.390
do they think abortion
is fair, it's all right,

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:13.860
are they're against it?

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.670
They don't know.

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:18.070
I started to interview
these kids, right?

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:20.620
I started talking to
the kids in groups.

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:26.400
And I'd show these things
and I would say, why?

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.900
Why would you show this?

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:29.484
And they literally
would like-- they

00:20:29.484 --> 00:20:30.900
know it's supposed
to be bad, they

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:37.090
have to cover their face like
they just thought it was funny.

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:39.570
What about that is funny?

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:44.670
And I would say, OK, and I
would name the person that I

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:46.230
had blocked out that said this.

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:47.920
Do you know who that person is?

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:50.310
No.

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:53.870
So you don't know what
their intent is behind this.

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:56.460
Is this a real picture?

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:57.840
I don't know.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.780
How would you like it
if that was your sister?

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:02.790
They're horrified.

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:05.580
That's someone's sister.

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.860
You don't know
what the intent is

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:10.650
of the person that posted
this, yet you are readily

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:11.320
reposting it.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:14.220
And that's what I mean by
this just constant stimuli.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:17.940
They see something, oh
ha-ha and it's peers,

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:19.830
everybody's retweeting,
everybody's liking

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:20.580
so they do it too.

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:22.944
They don't even know
why they're doing it.

00:21:22.944 --> 00:21:24.360
They don't think
about the effect,

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:25.776
they don't think
about the intent.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:37.650
The messages that society
spreads are so important.

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:44.340
And through social media, we
are willingly and incessantly

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.560
spreading messages
without knowing what

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.090
the intent of that message is.

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:56.390
So it's like that
noise of society.

00:21:56.390 --> 00:22:03.140
And when you talk about purpose
in everything that you do,

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:06.590
that intent is so important.

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:10.980
So when you aren't
listening to yourself

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:14.540
and you lose that
self-awareness,

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:17.450
you lose that accountability
for what you're

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:19.200
doing with your own actions.

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.880
So up to this, it leads me
to contradiction, right?

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.530
A lot of times
you're not thinking

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:26.154
about what you're
doing, a lot of times

00:22:26.154 --> 00:22:28.010
you do contradictory things.

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:31.040
This is a 17-year-old
girl that posted this.

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.370
Right?

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:34.124
Am I just an overprotective
mother, right,

00:22:34.124 --> 00:22:35.540
am I just like
someone who thinks,

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:38.300
oh my god, if that
was my daughter.

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:39.860
It's not graphic, right?

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:41.840
I mean, there's
ads for underwear

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:45.110
that aren't that
different than that.

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:49.380
But look what it
says, if we date

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:53.010
with the emoji with the tongue.

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:55.050
But look at-- this is
her favorites-- look

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:56.520
at the post right before it.

00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:02.610
The new Steven Universe episode
was about sexual harassment.

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:04.130
This show was so important.

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:09.770
So she's telling people
this is so important

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:13.630
and let's see, there's
five likes of that.

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:18.990
Yet the very next thing she
favorites is this photograph.

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:21.330
And she writes, if we date.

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:27.430
And there's 349
retweets and 562 likes.

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:28.900
It's completely contradictory.

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:37.160
And I have to say that
it's not that untypical.

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.350
Here's another one.

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:41.120
If she sucks your
fingers, keep her.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.850
She nasty.

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:46.690
I mean-- and oh,
yeah, there's a hell

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:51.190
of a lot to retweets
and likes of that one.

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:54.670
So these are just your
typical teenage kids.

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:56.680
These are not these
troublemaking kids

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.630
and oh, my kid
would never do that.

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:02.730
I know who these kids
are, they're good kids.

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:06.570
But it's they become
desensitized to this, right?

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:10.650
And it leads to more and
more and more problems.

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:12.950
And while I'm
picking on the kids,

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:17.790
I've got to say adults too
oftentimes are no better.

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:22.380
So we will have
an NFL player that

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:26.130
gets filmed in an elevator
hitting a woman, right?

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:29.850
We will have a politician
that gets caught

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:35.070
for sexual harassment, we will
have news anchors, celebrities,

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:36.390
same thing happens.

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:39.600
And sometimes they get away with
it, sometimes the hammer falls,

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.520
they lose their jobs, right?

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:45.150
And so women, we as women
stand up and we say,

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:48.190
we are not going to
accept this behavior.

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:48.960
This is wrong.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:54.480
It is wrong for women to not
be treated fairly, right?

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.040
We want to demand
fair treatment,

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:58.710
we want an end to
sexual harassment,

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:04.900
we want an end to an abuse
of power and control.

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:07.754
Did you "Fifty
Shades of Gray" yet?

00:25:07.754 --> 00:25:09.420
Let's read it for our
book club and then

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:11.930
we'll all go see
the movie together.

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:15.370
It's a total contradiction.

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:17.010
It's a complete contradiction.

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:25.680
This is the message that
we're sending to our daughters

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.270
and to the boys
that they will date.

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:35.950
So this leads me to did
anybody read this book yet,

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:39.450
Jon Krakauer, "Missoula?"

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:41.221
Heard of it before?

00:25:41.221 --> 00:25:41.720
OK.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.160
How many of you have heard
of "Fifty Shades of Gray?"

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.800
OK.

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:52.300
So if you have a child
going to college,

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.280
you have got to make
them read this book.

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:58.870
This should be the FYE book
for every student going

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:00.790
into college.

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:03.250
Jon does not need my
help to sell any books

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:05.010
and I'm not doing that for this.

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:06.370
This because I believe in this.

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:07.930
My 18-year-old will
not go to college

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:11.380
without reading this
book, college or not,

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:12.410
wherever they go.

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:15.580
So "Missoula," John in
his journalistic style

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:17.920
investigates the
campus rape culture.

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.680
And I am not asked to
go speak to any colleges

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:25.660
anymore without addressing
the issue of sexual violence.

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:31.670
Every college I go to, they want
me to merge that into my talk.

00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:34.430
It is a huge issue.

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:38.320
But look at some of the things
we just saw on social media

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.930
and it goes back
to self-awareness

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:42.250
and accountability.

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:50.650
In Jon's book, the overwhelming
majority of these cases

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:54.510
are you have a young
man and a young woman

00:26:54.510 --> 00:27:00.220
and in the
overwhelming majority,

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:05.210
they were highly intoxicated
when this event happened.

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:09.710
So there's interviews
and intercourse happened

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:11.510
and somebody thought
that it was consensual

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:12.890
and the other
person didn't think

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:14.840
it is but they know
that they blacked out

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:16.670
and the other person
blacked out, too.

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:20.287
And so piecing that all
together is difficult.

00:27:20.287 --> 00:27:22.370
And it goes back to what
I try to talk to students

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:25.240
about is self-awareness.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.110
It's not just what's
my purpose in life

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:29.510
and what am I going
to do with my career?

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:34.640
It's being aware of your space
and your time right now where

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:37.600
you are, what you're
doing, and if you

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:41.950
have control of your
intent and do others around

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:43.180
you have control of theirs?

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:51.285
To me, so much goes back to--

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:56.080
and this is like this.

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.800
There's this controversy
of truth, right?

00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.940
What's the truth?

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:05.004
And there will be
controversy about that,

00:28:05.004 --> 00:28:06.420
but is it getting
enough attention

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:09.352
for the right reasons?

00:28:09.352 --> 00:28:10.810
It brings me back
to the influences

00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:13.405
surrounding these students that
are on their way to college.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.460
Let me give you a
little bit of levity.

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:24.010
As I was on my book tour not
long after Jon's book had come

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:29.140
out, I go into a bookstore.

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:32.807
And I'm always looking to
see what books are out there.

00:28:32.807 --> 00:28:34.390
And I'm looking at
Jon's books and Jon

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:36.400
has several bestsellers.

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.950
And you usually
see a few copies.

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:42.790
And then I also happened to
see Charles Krauthammer's book

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:43.690
and I like him.

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:47.230
And I picked it up and I'm
on a long layover in Chicago

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:49.960
so I'm reading the
chapter that he entitles,

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:53.392
"In Defense of the F Word"--
which is brilliant, by the way.

00:28:53.392 --> 00:28:54.350
So I'm looking at that.

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:57.340
But as I'm reading, I'm
standing there reading

00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:59.410
and I'm distracted.

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:01.150
I'm like there's
something that's

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:02.660
catching my eye peripherally.

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:04.540
And it was boobs.

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:05.905
It was a big set of boobs.

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:10.790
Everyone knows who
that is, right?

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:14.589
So there's like three copies
of Jon's book, "Missoula,"

00:29:14.589 --> 00:29:16.505
there's a few copies of
Charles Krauthammer's.

00:29:16.505 --> 00:29:20.690
There's like 50
copies of this book

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:23.960
and this is Kim
Kardashian's book entitled--

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.310
it's her book of selfies.

00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:30.360
And no, I'm not trying to
harp on Kim or anything.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.600
I'm just saying, let's
use this as an example

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.599
because she certainly doesn't
mind putting it out there.

00:29:35.599 --> 00:29:37.640
There's like 50 copies of
this book on the shelf.

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.110
The book's entitled "Selfish."

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:44.480
And why does the bookstore
have so many of her copies?

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.800
It's a big book, too.

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:49.280
I mean, you're in an airport
bookstore, it's heavy.

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:51.696
Why are there so many
copies on that shelf?

00:29:51.696 --> 00:29:53.570
Because they know they're
going to sell them.

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:54.111
It's society.

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:00.230
And while I was looking
up to find this cover,

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:04.160
I found this one, which
I thought was hilarious--

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:07.170
Kim Carr-Dachshund, "Shellfish."

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:10.200
I thought that was brilliant.

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:10.859
All right.

00:30:10.859 --> 00:30:11.900
Let me bring things back.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:12.399
OK.

00:30:12.399 --> 00:30:16.880
So this just brings me
back to the influence

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:20.730
surrounding teenagers, right?

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:28.140
And not just kids of
this age, but little kids

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:30.870
because the little brothers
and sisters of kids these age

00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:32.010
want to be just like them.

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:35.440
They can't wait to get their
iPhones, their androids.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:38.767
They can't wait to get
their phones, right?

00:30:38.767 --> 00:30:40.350
And that's what they
see all the time.

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:43.170
They are very aware of what
the teenagers are doing.

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:52.100
Does anyone know-- this
is someone in particular.

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.166
Does anyone know who this is?

00:30:54.166 --> 00:30:57.270
Does anybody recognize?

00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:57.770
OK.

00:30:57.770 --> 00:30:59.210
And I take this around to--

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:01.160
I've taken this around
to a lot of students

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.980
in different schools
all over the country.

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:06.650
Almost nobody knows
who this person is.

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:11.861
Lately, though, everybody
knows who this person is.

00:31:11.861 --> 00:31:12.360
Right?

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:14.030
I know some of you are--

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:18.270
which is-- but now what if
I said, catch me outside,

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:20.180
how about that?

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:20.770
Right?

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:24.700
You know who that is because
it's all over the internet.

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:28.530
So I didn't know who it
was, but on Saturday I

00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:32.600
had my littlest girl,
my youngest daughter,

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:34.740
at ukulele lessons.

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:37.392
And he said, you're speaking at
Google on Tuesday, aren't you?

00:31:37.392 --> 00:31:38.100
And I said, yeah.

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:39.810
And I told them what
the title of my talk

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:44.730
was going to be, "The
Socialization of Domestic

00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:49.060
Violence: Diluting a
Devastating Influence."

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:52.420
And he says, oh, yeah.

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.261
He teaches at the
Academy of Rock

00:31:54.261 --> 00:31:55.760
and so he's got a
group of students.

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.640
He goes in one day and
they're all joking and saying,

00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.170
catch me outside,
how about that?

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:00.280
And he says, are you
speaking English?

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:01.420
What are you saying?

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:02.380
So then they tell him.

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:04.254
They pull out their
phones and they show him.

00:32:04.254 --> 00:32:06.220
Look at this girl,
it's hilarious.

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:09.010
And he's thinking, oh my gosh.

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:11.330
Well, so he starts telling
me about this person

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:16.150
and come to find out
she on "Dr. Phil."

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:20.470
And I watched the video on
YouTube and during the video,

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:22.515
she threatens to
beat the audience up.

00:32:22.515 --> 00:32:23.890
That's what the
catch me outside,

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:26.230
how about that is-- she's
going to beat the audience up.

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:27.990
Her mother translated.

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:32.980
And and then she got up and
she got up in her mother's face

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:36.380
and she was threatening
to beat up her mom.

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:40.070
This girl apparently now
has endorsement deals,

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:43.490
she's signed a contract
for a reality show.

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:45.800
Let's see how many
views are on this?

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:50.620
5.5 million views, right?

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:56.100
This is the other picture.

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:58.600
This is Jack Andraka, I hope
I'm saying the last name right.

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:02.890
I met him-- he probably
won't remember me,

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:04.240
but I definitely remembered him.

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.890
I met him at an NYU conference.

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:09.900
Both of our books
were featured as books

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:12.970
to use as required
reading at colleges.

00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:14.770
And he presented.

00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:18.560
And this is a young
teenage genius--

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:20.770
he's now at Stanford,
class of 2019--

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:25.110
who invented an early--

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:26.635
he invented a--

00:33:26.635 --> 00:33:30.410
I don't even have the to
explain it all properly.

00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:35.510
But he developed a
very economical test

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:38.025
sets an early detector
for pancreatic cancer

00:33:38.025 --> 00:33:39.670
because he lost
someone in his life

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:42.080
to pancreatic cancer that
was very dear to him.

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:46.254
He's also invented a
water bottle that--

00:33:46.254 --> 00:33:48.670
not these expensive ones that
we buy at the sports stores,

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:52.540
but something that can be
manufactured for pennies

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:55.300
on the dollar compared
to others and can

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:57.850
be sent to these
third world countries

00:33:57.850 --> 00:34:00.250
where people don't have
access to clean water.

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:03.760
And they can go and scoop up
this water that's not drinkable

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:04.400
and they drink.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:07.030
So he's saving lives,
he's changing the world.

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:08.821
None of the teenagers
know who this is.

00:34:11.469 --> 00:34:13.840
Here's jack Ted talk.

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:15.550
It's got 304,000 views.

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:17.840
That's pretty good.

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:22.449
She's got 5.5 million views.

00:34:22.449 --> 00:34:24.520
It doesn't mean that
they are approving of it,

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:27.110
but that's saturation.

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:29.000
That's influential.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.639
Because whereas some of these
kids might kind of laugh at her

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:34.969
and talk about how much,
they also are thinking,

00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:38.614
wow, she's made all that money.

00:34:38.614 --> 00:34:39.530
I mean, they're human.

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:41.530
That's the kind of things
that they think about.

00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:43.100
Kids think about
shoes and they want

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.090
the Range Rover like
somebody else has.

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:52.679
So let's see, here's
her, Danielle Bregoli,

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:53.909
I guess is her name.

00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:56.850
Here's her Twitter page.

00:34:56.850 --> 00:35:03.660
She's got 243,000
followers and she just

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:07.689
joined February of 2017.

00:35:07.689 --> 00:35:10.230
So in just a couple of months,
she's got that many followers.

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:12.510
Here's Jack's page.

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:16.160
He joined in July of 2011.

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:21.330
He's got just under
22,000 followers.

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:23.850
Here's his Instagram page.

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:26.560
He's got 3,400 followers.

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:29.560
He's probably had it
up for several years.

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:35.000
Here's her Instagram
page, 9.2 million.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.780
9.2 million
followers, which means

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:41.900
when these kids go and scroll
the latest video that she

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:44.750
posted bragging about
bullying people and beating up

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:50.880
kids and stealing cars,
there's only 3,400

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:53.520
that are learning about
Jack's latest invention that's

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:57.970
going to change this world.

00:35:57.970 --> 00:36:00.490
But what did we as a society--

00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:00.990
why?

00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:03.690
Why does everybody
not know who this is?

00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:07.320
Why do they know who she is?

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.750
You don't have to be
intentionally searching

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:13.110
for something negative,
but it's so saturated

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:14.460
that that's what's out there.

00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:20.970
Now, I'm not saying that
there isn't also good

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:23.640
that comes with the
exposure, right?

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:27.250
I mean, technology has
been a wonderful thing.

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:29.760
So here's an organization,
nomore.org, right?

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.300
They've been fantastic.

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:33.292
I've spoken all around
the country at groups

00:36:33.292 --> 00:36:35.250
and a lot of times they
are related in some way

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:36.930
to this group in support.

00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:41.490
I've spoken at New Beginnings
in Seattle, Center for Women

00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:47.190
in Transition in Michigan,
the Women's Home in Texas,

00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:52.170
Samaritan House where I
live in Virginia, Shelter

00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:54.210
House, The Barn outside of DC.

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:57.360
There's organizations
all over the country

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:02.760
that are working to prevent
domestic and sexual violence.

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:04.530
And they're out there.

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:10.440
But this group has
55,000 followers.

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:14.220
55,000 followers
compared to nine--

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:15.750
well, let's be fair.

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:18.220
That was her Instagram page.

00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:24.230
Instagram, they have almost
30,000 followers compared

00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:26.440
to what was hers, 9.2 million?

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:32.840
There's something
wrong with that.

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:34.270
And I don't have
all the answers,

00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:37.990
but I know there's
something wrong with that.

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:42.460
This is the kind of
thing that concerns me

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:45.040
because it's out of balance.

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:55.690
I care about it because I'm
worried for these kids who

00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:57.640
see domestic violence
every day and they

00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:00.490
have become acclimated to it
and don't understand it's wrong.

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.590
I worry for these kids.

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:08.117
These are my girls,
Heather and Christiana.

00:38:08.117 --> 00:38:08.950
I love that picture.

00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:11.740
They're bigger now so they don't
like when I show that picture.

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:14.319
Heather thinks that she doesn't
look good without makeup

00:38:14.319 --> 00:38:15.610
and that her hair is too curly.

00:38:15.610 --> 00:38:17.151
So here's another
picture of Heather.

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:23.340
So I worry about
this as a mom, I

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:25.110
worry about this
as an advocate, I

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:27.750
worry about this as
a community member.

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:34.790
But I also worry
about this as a sister

00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:41.000
because I am desperate to
know that as a human race

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:48.070
that we have learned something
in the past 25 years.

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:49.500
It's been 25 years.

00:38:57.110 --> 00:39:00.600
But I don't have the power and
I don't have all the answers,

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:01.420
right?

00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:02.110
I'm one person.

00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:04.193
There are a lot of advocates
all over the country.

00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:09.430
Who does have the power?

00:39:12.037 --> 00:39:13.370
I think you guys have the power.

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:19.590
We're at freaking Google, right?

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:20.640
What's a Google?

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:23.760
Google is like the highest
number you can get, right?

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:24.739
10 to 100th power.

00:39:24.739 --> 00:39:26.280
I'm not a mathematician,
I Google it.

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:34.145
These pages that populate, these
recommendations that come up,

00:39:34.145 --> 00:39:35.770
somebody is programming
all that stuff.

00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:38.020
Somebody is creating that.

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:41.980
Some of the most brilliant
minds are in this 100 plus

00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:45.370
set of buildings.

00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:49.990
Why can't we come
up with a way that

00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:52.270
helps with a better balance?

00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:53.770
I'm not talking
about censorship,

00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:55.060
I'm talking about balance.

00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:57.705
I'm talking about educating
these young people.

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:03.760
There's got to be
a way to do it.

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:08.520
And I challenge you guys to
come up with those answers.

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:11.910
So I think that can
bring us into the Q&amp;A.

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:15.840
You guys have everyone's
attention every day.

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:18.870
You and companies like yours
have everyone's attention

00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:25.018
every day, so what can you
do to help with this balance?

00:40:25.018 --> 00:40:27.413
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:32.660
SACHIT EGAN: So what I take
away from hearing you talk

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:36.890
and reading your book
is that in his own way,

00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:40.289
Chris in his time when he was
coming of age was frustrated

00:40:40.289 --> 00:40:42.080
by a lot of the things
you just mentioned--

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:44.429
maybe not Instagram and
Twitter back then, but--

00:40:44.429 --> 00:40:45.470
CARINE MCCANDLESS: Right.

00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:46.895
It didn't exist back then.

00:40:46.895 --> 00:40:48.590
That's one of my points.

00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:51.350
Students will say to
me, weren't you just

00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:53.760
pissed that he didn't
send you a text?

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.400
You didn't hear from
him for two years.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:57.050
He didn't even
send you an email.

00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:59.020
And I hold up my
phone and I say,

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:00.360
we didn't have these back then.

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:02.660
And they think, she
looks amazing for being

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:03.950
200 years old.

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:06.130
I mean, they don't--

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:08.522
it's-- they can't comprehend it.

00:41:08.522 --> 00:41:10.730
That's like trying to explain
to someone that there's

00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:12.290
no oxygen in the air.

00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:14.150
They can't comprehend that.

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:18.860
That's why to me, all
these things aren't

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:21.290
necessarily real to them.

00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:23.449
They're clicking and
favoriting and reposting

00:41:23.449 --> 00:41:25.490
without really thinking
about what they're doing.

00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:26.010
Sorry.

00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:28.135
SACHIT EGAN: So if I may,
that's a great transition

00:41:28.135 --> 00:41:29.810
to what I was getting at.

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:31.760
In both Jon's book
and in your book,

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:34.300
you do a great job of talking
about how Chris was just--

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:36.716
you began this talk with how
Chris was a little different,

00:41:36.716 --> 00:41:37.920
even at age 6.

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:38.420
Right.

00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:40.819
CARINE MCCANDLESS: He
was more aware than most.

00:41:40.819 --> 00:41:41.610
SACHIT EGAN: Right.

00:41:41.610 --> 00:41:44.820
He cared about authenticity,
he had principles.

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:47.720
And you describe him as
being unique in that way.

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:49.724
In your book you say
even friends would say,

00:41:49.724 --> 00:41:51.140
your brother is a
little intense--

00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:52.820
not in a bad way,
but he's intense.

00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:55.820
So what I wonder is if
you fast forward to today,

00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:59.930
it is still the norm for people
to click on catch me outside,

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:01.580
how about that
instead of the book--

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:02.996
CARINE MCCANDLESS:
How about that?

00:42:02.996 --> 00:42:04.130
SACHIT EGAN: Thank you.

00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:04.940
CARINE MCCANDLESS:
Let's be fair.

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:05.960
SACHIT EGAN: Fair enough.

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.160
It's still the norm
for people to be

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:09.160
attracted to that and not
to stand up in the way

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:10.520
that Chris did.

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:14.450
So what I wonder is do you
have thoughts for students

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:16.340
that you speak to around the--

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:18.010
like, how and why can
be more authentic?

00:42:18.010 --> 00:42:20.551
CARINE MCCANDLESS: I mean, some
of it's entertainment, right?

00:42:20.551 --> 00:42:23.630
You have students who are going
through these calculus classes

00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:28.940
and do they necessarily
want to think that much?

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:33.140
And so part of
it's entertainment.

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:35.790
But there has to be
some responsibility

00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:37.400
then and accountability.

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:40.310
Because you can't tell
me that seeing that

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:42.380
and that being so saturated--

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:45.980
and not just that, it's
being rewarded by adults.

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:53.770
It's not other kids that gave
her a reality show, right?

00:42:53.770 --> 00:42:56.860
So kids see that.

00:42:56.860 --> 00:43:01.030
That's what I'm talking about
is that kind of responsibility

00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.822
and accountability.

00:43:01.822 --> 00:43:03.446
I probably didn't
answer your question.

00:43:03.446 --> 00:43:04.505
SACHIT EGAN: No, no, no.

00:43:04.505 --> 00:43:07.150
There's no easy
answer to how do you

00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:09.790
solve this truth of society.

00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:12.670
But I think one thing you
talk a lot about is parenting

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:14.202
and how Chris and you both--

00:43:14.202 --> 00:43:15.910
it's beautiful in your
book, you describe

00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:17.286
the lessons you
learned about how

00:43:17.286 --> 00:43:18.660
you want to do
things differently

00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:20.400
than your parents
did, for example.

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:20.530
CARINE MCCANDLESS: Yeah.

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:21.880
And my parents weren't all bad.

00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:22.790
I mean, they weren't.

00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:25.120
And I talk about that and
I flush it out in my book.

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:28.870
They taught us some
hard work ethics

00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:30.280
and a lot of good things, too.

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:33.327
But you have to decide what
you're going to emulate

00:43:33.327 --> 00:43:34.160
and what you're not.

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:36.550
And specifically on the
issue of domestic violence,

00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:39.520
breaking that cycle is
a very important thing

00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:41.460
and it's not easy to do.

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:45.250
SACHIT EGAN: And so
in that same vein,

00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:47.440
you talk about some examples
with your own daughters

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:52.660
of how you try to embody
authenticity, positive thoughts

00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:55.360
around relationships and around
the relationship with the self.

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:57.490
I know a lot of parents
are either in this room

00:43:57.490 --> 00:43:58.980
or watching on livestream.

00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:00.745
Do have any thoughts
or tips around how

00:44:00.745 --> 00:44:02.680
to embody these values
in your own family?

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:03.680
CARINE MCCANDLESS: Sure.

00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:09.160
And I'm not standing up here
like, hey, I'm doing it right

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:10.720
and everyone has
got to get on board.

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:11.710
No, no, no, no.

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:13.750
My 18-year-old, I love her.

00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:15.199
She is such a good kid.

00:44:15.199 --> 00:44:16.990
I have an 18-year-old
daughter that's never

00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:20.900
rolled her eyes at me in my
presence or slammed a door,

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:21.670
right?

00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:22.180
Miracle.

00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:24.640
Is it because I'm such
an amazing parent?

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:25.690
I'd like to think so.

00:44:25.690 --> 00:44:28.450
She's probably not
going to say that.

00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:30.910
But let's take that for example.

00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:35.200
I take my kids to my events
and sometimes things sink

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.330
in and sometimes they don't.

00:44:37.330 --> 00:44:40.082
My oldest, she came up
from the basement one night

00:44:40.082 --> 00:44:42.040
and I was sitting working
at the kitchen table.

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:43.831
And she came up and I
might get off tangent

00:44:43.831 --> 00:44:45.150
and you can reel me back in.

00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:49.660
But she came up from watching
a TV show just blubbering.

00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:54.620
I mean, she was crying so
hard that she couldn't speak.

00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:55.120
And

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:56.710
I'm like oh my God,
Heather, what's the matter?

00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:57.293
What happened?

00:44:57.293 --> 00:44:58.120
What's wrong?

00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:00.495
I can't-- I can't--

00:45:00.495 --> 00:45:04.260
I don't remember
the name, Glenn--

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:06.685
[SOBBING SOUNDS]

00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:15.042
She just-- I'm like, oh, she's
watching "The Walking Dead."

00:45:15.042 --> 00:45:16.250
I've never watched that show.

00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:18.360
I don't-- maybe I shouldn't
be letting my kids watch that

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:18.859
show.

00:45:18.859 --> 00:45:19.950
I don't know.

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:26.790
But she is beyond herself
with grief, genuinely.

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:27.990
She's a smart kid.

00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:32.520
And I say, Honey first
of all, he didn't die.

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:34.980
I hear you talk about
this guy all the time.

00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:36.540
I know people that
write scripts,

00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:37.830
this guy didn't die, OK?

00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:40.790
This is the last show
of the season, trust me.

00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:41.820
He didn't die.

00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:44.940
They just want you to think so.

00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:49.800
But she could not connect--

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:54.210
she's smart, but they're so
disconnected from reality.

00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:57.450
It affected her so much.

00:45:57.450 --> 00:45:59.970
And it's easier to connect
to things like that.

00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:02.190
Now, when I talked to her
about real things that

00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:06.300
are happening in the world
and these terrible tragedies,

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:08.040
she doesn't have
the same reaction.

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:12.280
I mean, maybe part of it
is a defense mechanism.

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:15.000
It's not that she isn't
concerned about those things,

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.220
but it's--

00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:20.280
that is-- that's not
good that that happened.

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:22.570
But it's not this--

00:46:22.570 --> 00:46:26.550
and so it bewilders
me sometimes.

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:28.140
But when it comes
to parents, right, I

00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:30.056
say maybe I shouldn't
let her watch that show.

00:46:30.056 --> 00:46:32.807
Now, I think it's OK for
her to watch that show.

00:46:32.807 --> 00:46:34.890
It's probably something I
should have watched so I

00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:37.420
could make that determination.

00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:39.540
But I talk with other
parents about these issues

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:42.194
and I'll mention how I found
Heather posting something

00:46:42.194 --> 00:46:44.610
inappropriate and so I took
her phone away for six months.

00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:50.254
And I get this, you took
your daughter's phone?

00:46:50.254 --> 00:46:51.170
I could never do that.

00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:52.378
Oh my God, she would hate me.

00:46:52.378 --> 00:46:53.266
My kid would hate me.

00:46:53.266 --> 00:46:55.450
I'm like, well, your kid's 12.

00:46:55.450 --> 00:46:57.200
I mean, and I'm not
judging other parents.

00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:59.100
Everyone has their
own things going on.

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:01.400
But it goes back to
this accountability

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:02.660
and responsibility.

00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:05.690
I mean, you have
to be willing to--

00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:07.190
my advice to parents,
you have to be

00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:08.900
willing to not be
their best friend

00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:11.211
because you have to
be their parent first.

00:47:11.211 --> 00:47:12.710
And later in life,
hopefully they'll

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:15.127
realize that you were
their best friend

00:47:15.127 --> 00:47:16.460
and really looking out for them.

00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:21.064
But we all survived without
phones and computers

00:47:21.064 --> 00:47:21.980
when we were that age.

00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:23.490
And so you have to--

00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:28.520
and my advice to the
students, every time I'm

00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:32.361
talking with students, I
always hold up my journal

00:47:32.361 --> 00:47:33.860
and I ask them, how
many of people--

00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:36.930
how many people in
this room journal?

00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:37.460
OK.

00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:39.150
I always say, everybody
should journal,

00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:40.570
even if it's one or
two sentences a night.

00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:41.820
And I don't do it every night.

00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:44.210
Sometimes I'm too exhausted.

00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:46.940
But the good thing
about journaling,

00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:49.790
I always say you do it with
a real paper and a pen.

00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:53.180
Why do you think it's
with a real paper and pen?

00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:54.950
They want to go
to their devices.

00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:56.690
But if you go to
your device, you're

00:47:56.690 --> 00:47:59.030
going to be bombarded by
all this stuff-- some good,

00:47:59.030 --> 00:48:00.450
a lot bad.

00:48:00.450 --> 00:48:03.110
And that's the noise,
this noise of society.

00:48:03.110 --> 00:48:04.770
What are your thoughts?

00:48:04.770 --> 00:48:06.440
What are you thinking?

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:09.500
Get away from all the
influence and figure out

00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:12.064
what your place is in this
world, what you want to do.

00:48:12.064 --> 00:48:12.980
SACHIT EGAN: For sure.

00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:15.500
You talk about your brother
being your protector all

00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:17.940
the time and you see
it in the pictures,

00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:19.940
you see it in stories,
you share it in the book.

00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:22.610
And I wondered if
his inclination

00:48:22.610 --> 00:48:25.670
to think about these deep
things at a younger age

00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:28.520
was in part because he
was a protector for you.

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:31.040
He was, in a way, I think
trying to self parent a bit

00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:33.920
and provide some positive
influence in your life

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:35.270
and help you, as well.

00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:38.390
And so he was taking that
responsibility at a young age,

00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:41.420
younger than most
people are comfortable.

00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:43.220
And now you're encouraging
kids to journal

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:45.345
and do what Chris did in
taking some accountability

00:48:45.345 --> 00:48:47.420
and responsibility
for their own selves.

00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:49.240
But you also talk
about parents and I

00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:51.440
think what I hear you
saying is, parents,

00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:54.620
it might suck if your
daughter hates you for a day,

00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:55.610
but that's your kid.

00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:56.270
CARINE MCCANDLESS:
Well, she might

00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:57.520
hate you loner than a day.

00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:58.940
But however long it takes.

00:48:58.940 --> 00:48:59.930
SACHIT EGAN: Right.

00:48:59.930 --> 00:49:01.070
But I hear you
saying to parents,

00:49:01.070 --> 00:49:03.570
take some responsibility to
have that difficult conversation

00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:06.077
instead of just batting your
eye or looking another way.

00:49:06.077 --> 00:49:07.535
We all need to be
more responsible,

00:49:07.535 --> 00:49:09.410
is that what you're saying?

00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:10.451
CARINE MCCANDLESS: Right.

00:49:10.451 --> 00:49:14.540
And I'm not stellar
at all of this myself.

00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:18.050
We, I put we in
this including me.

00:49:18.050 --> 00:49:21.060
It's tough for parents of--

00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:24.710
I'm 45 years old and I updated
some apps the other day.

00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:27.770
I have no clue how the hell
they use these things now,

00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:29.480
but my 11-year-old
could pick up my phone

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:32.240
and intuitively
just figure it out.

00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:36.440
So a lot of times, when I talk
to parents about social media,

00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:39.840
they, oh, I don't even
understand how all that works.

00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:41.840
Some of them have the
attitude of you know what?

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:43.970
You've just got
to trust your kid.

00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:46.460
But they aren't aware of
a lot of the things that

00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:50.030
are happening and the things
that those kids are exposed to.

00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:51.410
So you have to be
willing to have

00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:52.970
the uncomfortable
conversations, you

00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:55.070
have to be willing
to take the phone,

00:49:55.070 --> 00:49:57.140
you have to be,
unfortunately, willing

00:49:57.140 --> 00:50:00.950
to learn how Snapchat works.

00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:01.460
You do.

00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:03.530
If you're going to give
them the access to it,

00:50:03.530 --> 00:50:04.340
you've got to be willing to--

00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:06.260
but let me make a
point here about Chris.

00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:09.080
You said that I encourage
kids to do it Chris did.

00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:11.397
Chris died out in the
middle of the wilderness.

00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:17.710
So I encourage-- people tell
me, I get messages to people

00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:20.650
all over the world and people
say that your brother changed

00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:22.380
my life.

00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:28.980
And I see where Chris inspires
people to make positive changes

00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:30.090
in their lives.

00:50:30.090 --> 00:50:32.004
But when someone tells
me and they come to me

00:50:32.004 --> 00:50:33.420
and they're in
tears and they say,

00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:39.190
your brother saved my
life, I say to them,

00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:42.890
Chris died in 1992.

00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:45.090
He couldn't do that for you.

00:50:45.090 --> 00:50:48.440
Now, he can be a spark
that lights a fuel in you

00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:51.380
to do that for
yourself, but own it.

00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:53.810
You did that for yourself.

00:50:53.810 --> 00:51:00.410
And so yeah, I want
people to be influenced

00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:08.540
by Chris' desire to have
a purpose in life, right?

00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:12.470
He died so young, but he's
influenced so many people

00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:17.280
without even trying to,
and for the most part

00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:18.920
in very positive ways.

00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:22.140
But Chris was also accountable.

00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:26.650
He knew that he put himself
in a very difficult situation

00:51:26.650 --> 00:51:30.130
and he didn't blame
anybody else for it.

00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:34.810
I talk a lot about our childhood
and my parents in my book,

00:51:34.810 --> 00:51:37.960
but I don't blame
them for his death.

00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:42.950
Chris put himself out in
the wilderness unprepared.

00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:46.370
I do hold him accountable
for his disappearance,

00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:48.970
and that's a very
different thing.

00:51:48.970 --> 00:51:50.910
So one of the greatest
lessons that people

00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:57.390
can learn from Chris and kids
of that age is to be accountable

00:51:57.390 --> 00:51:58.770
and to have that self-awareness.

00:51:58.770 --> 00:52:02.700
Because at the end, I don't
know if we have time for it,

00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:06.650
but Chris--

00:52:06.650 --> 00:52:09.670
I put some more slides up
here simply because there's

00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:13.240
a lot of things-- that's
me hiking to the- us,

00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:14.270
Chris on the road.

00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:23.990
So just very quickly,
at the end of the movie,

00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:26.750
they show this note.

00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:29.750
So this is the note
that Chris wrote

00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:32.049
when he knew he was dying,
I have had a happy life

00:52:32.049 --> 00:52:32.840
and thank the Lord.

00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:34.340
Goodbye and may God bless all.

00:52:38.090 --> 00:52:44.740
So he had taken that page
out of one of his books

00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:49.000
and on the opposite
was this excerpt

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.550
from a poem by Robinson Jeffers
from "Wise Men in the Bad

00:52:52.550 --> 00:52:53.050
Hours."

00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:55.260
It reads, "Death's
a fierce meadowlark,

00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:57.100
but to die having
made something more

00:52:57.100 --> 00:52:59.080
equal to the centuries
than muscle and bone

00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:00.235
is mostly to shed weakness.

00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:04.660
The mountains are dead stone.

00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:07.350
The people admire or
hate their stature,

00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:09.420
their insolent quietness.

00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:12.250
The mountains are not
softened nor troubled

00:53:12.250 --> 00:53:15.730
and a few dead men's thoughts
have the same temper."

00:53:15.730 --> 00:53:18.660
Chris didn't do anything
without a purpose.

00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:20.610
He didn't just randomly
pull this one page

00:53:20.610 --> 00:53:22.795
and decide to write the
last words that he's

00:53:22.795 --> 00:53:24.790
going to write in his life.

00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:26.380
And he also didn't
do it for us, he

00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:27.630
didn't do it for anybody else.

00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:28.580
He didn't know that
anybody was ever

00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:29.795
going to find this or care.

00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:34.680
When the students
take pictures, what's

00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:38.220
the first thing we all do
now when we take a picture?

00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:39.949
SACHIT EGAN: Uploaded it.

00:53:39.949 --> 00:53:42.240
CARINE MCCANDLESS: Maybe you
since you work for Google.

00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:44.350
I haven't uploaded
pictures in a long time.

00:53:44.350 --> 00:53:45.250
I'm so behind.

00:53:45.250 --> 00:53:45.750
No.

00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:48.892
The first thing we do is
we look at the picture.

00:53:48.892 --> 00:53:49.850
We look at the picture.

00:53:49.850 --> 00:53:52.850
Did we get the images that
we're looking for, right?

00:53:52.850 --> 00:53:56.150
But Chris, these pictures that
people see online of Chris,

00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:59.310
Chris never saw these pictures.

00:53:59.310 --> 00:54:01.939
That was back in the day where
you had this thing called film

00:54:01.939 --> 00:54:03.980
on a roll and you had to
take it to the drugstore

00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:05.820
and get it developed and
you don't even know what

00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:06.510
the images--

00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:10.325
but Chris, there aren't five
of these pictures, there's one.

00:54:10.325 --> 00:54:11.950
He didn't take it,
let me make sure I'm

00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:13.060
getting the right shot.

00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:15.820
And Jon writes
about, which is not

00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:19.270
a picture I have up here because
it's too difficult for me,

00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:21.250
and I read it at the
end of my Ted Talk,

00:54:21.250 --> 00:54:25.450
I believe, but he writes
about this photo of Chris,

00:54:25.450 --> 00:54:28.880
the last photo that
Chris takes of himself,

00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:30.760
and he talks about
how he's standing

00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:33.080
beneath the
highlights of the sky

00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:38.920
and if he feels betrayed that
his body has let him down.

00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:43.440
I'm totally-- Jon wrote it
so beautifully and I just--

00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:44.190
I have it here.

00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:49.070
Let me just do service to this.

00:54:49.070 --> 00:54:50.028
It just takes a minute.

00:54:56.310 --> 00:54:59.760
So he talks about this and
he quotes Jeffers' poem

00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:03.901
and he says, "One
of his last acts

00:55:03.901 --> 00:55:06.150
was to take a picture of
himself standing near the bus

00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:09.304
under the high Alaska sky, one
hand holding his final note

00:55:09.304 --> 00:55:10.970
toward the camera
lens, the other raised

00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:13.280
in a brave beatific farewell.

00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:18.060
His face is horribly
emaciated, almost skeletal.

00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:21.380
But if he pitied himself in
those last difficult hours

00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:25.250
because he was so young,
because he was alone,

00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:26.740
because his body
had betrayed him

00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:29.210
and his will had
let him down, it's

00:55:29.210 --> 00:55:32.020
not apparent from
the photograph.

00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:34.870
He is smiling in the
picture and there is no

00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:37.570
mistaking the look in his eyes.

00:55:37.570 --> 00:55:43.880
Chris McCandless was at peace,
serene as a monk gone to God."

00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:48.160
That picture that Jon's talking
about, it's not this one,

00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:52.900
is both the hardest and
the most wonderful picture

00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:53.830
for me to look at.

00:55:53.830 --> 00:55:57.557
It's a good pain, I call it,
because I see he's dying,

00:55:57.557 --> 00:55:58.140
he's skeletal.

00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:03.420
But he does have
this genuine smile.

00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:05.280
And there's one shot.

00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:08.192
He didn't take a bunch hoping,
oh, am I going to get it right?

00:56:08.192 --> 00:56:09.900
Am I going to put the
right thing across?

00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:12.240
He's not thinking
about anybody else.

00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:14.910
That's just pure emotion
coming out of him and it's real

00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:17.782
and it's genuine and it happens
to be because of his faith.

00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:25.690
But for any of us, whether we
live a young number of years

00:56:25.690 --> 00:56:28.240
or whether we live
into our 80s and 90s,

00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:31.570
to have that peace at
the end of our life,

00:56:31.570 --> 00:56:37.940
whenever that time comes, to
me that's what it's all about--

00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:39.630
to be at peace with
the past you've

00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:43.602
chosen in life in the way
you've lived your life, what

00:56:43.602 --> 00:56:44.810
the purpose of your life was.

00:56:44.810 --> 00:56:49.550
And although Chris'
life was short

00:56:49.550 --> 00:56:51.560
and although he
was so devastated

00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:54.020
to be losing his life
at such a young age,

00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:59.430
and I know this from reading
his journal, he was at peace--

00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:02.250
not because he was dying,
but because he had lived

00:57:02.250 --> 00:57:04.270
and the way he had lived.

00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:08.800
And to me, that's my advice for
students is use those journals,

00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:12.940
figure out who you are,
figure out what you want to be

00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:14.500
and what you want to do.

00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:16.240
And when that day
comes for you, and it's

00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:18.156
going to come for all
of us unless you guys at

00:57:18.156 --> 00:57:19.480
Google here figure out--

00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:22.360
I mean, it might be coming,
I'm sure you're working on it--

00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:24.130
better find us to
some other planets

00:57:24.130 --> 00:57:26.009
because it's getting
a little crowded.

00:57:26.009 --> 00:57:27.550
SACHIT EGAN: Talk
to Elan about that.

00:57:27.550 --> 00:57:28.550
CARINE MCCANDLESS: Yeah.

00:57:28.550 --> 00:57:30.480
We'll talk to Elan about it.

00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:32.797
But that's my point.

00:57:32.797 --> 00:57:35.380
SACHIT EGAN: Do you see any of
Chris' traits in your children?

00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:41.180
CARINE MCCANDLESS: Well, yes.

00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:48.860
So Heather isn't
biologically my child.

00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:49.670
I adopted her.

00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:55.610
So as far as traits if you
mean that have traveled down

00:57:55.610 --> 00:57:57.500
biologically.

00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:04.340
Christiana, my youngest,
she is named after Chris.

00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:07.230
She has Down syndrome.

00:58:07.230 --> 00:58:08.820
Doesn't matter.

00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:11.850
Nothing is going
to stop this kid.

00:58:11.850 --> 00:58:14.430
Things that remind
me of Chris in her

00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:17.009
are why can't I go
climb a 100-foot oak

00:58:17.009 --> 00:58:18.300
tree to play with the raccoons?

00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:20.130
I don't understand
why that's a problem.

00:58:20.130 --> 00:58:25.470
I mean, but there's also
just this purity in her.

00:58:25.470 --> 00:58:29.480
Obviously, she doesn't have--

00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:31.740
I don't know, she's only
11, I guess we'll see.

00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:35.660
But I mean, her deep thoughts
right now are about princesses.

00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:42.840
But there's a light
and a pureness in her

00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:45.521
that I definitely recognize.

00:58:45.521 --> 00:58:46.020
Yeah.

00:58:48.814 --> 00:58:49.772
SACHIT EGAN: Very cool.

00:58:49.772 --> 00:58:52.547
Anybody else?

00:58:52.547 --> 00:58:54.380
CARINE MCCANDLESS: Did
I talk so much that I

00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:56.079
answered all of your questions?

00:58:56.079 --> 00:58:57.120
SACHIT EGAN: That's fair.

00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:59.300
I'll ask you a final one then
and we can go to book signing.

00:58:59.300 --> 00:58:59.900
CARINE MCCANDLESS:
Are you guys going

00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:02.410
straight to a conference room
to figure out this whole issue

00:59:02.410 --> 00:59:03.331
after this?

00:59:03.331 --> 00:59:04.580
SACHIT EGAN: We've got a book.

00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:06.954
CARINE MCCANDLESS: How to
populate good influences coming

00:59:06.954 --> 00:59:07.970
into people's pages.

00:59:07.970 --> 00:59:09.180
SACHIT EGAN: This is
one you and I have

00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:10.263
talked about a little bit.

00:59:10.263 --> 00:59:14.530
But when I went and
visited the bus in 2012,

00:59:14.530 --> 00:59:18.680
there's some supplies and
things and notes and journals

00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:21.080
that people leave behind
for future visitors.

00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:23.000
And what was amazing
when I visited was

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:26.266
there was in a plastic bag
one of Carine's journals.

00:59:26.266 --> 00:59:28.640
And I think it's the one that
you had taken with you when

00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:31.680
you first visited the bus and
you'd left it there for people,

00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:33.980
I think, to write in.

00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:35.540
And getting to the
bus is not easy.

00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:37.850
It's 40 miles round trip.

00:59:37.850 --> 00:59:40.160
You have to cross two
rivers, it's the middle--

00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:44.300
the mosquitoes are insane.

00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:45.860
And I remember
we'd gotten there,

00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:47.660
we'd done a 20-mile
day that day to get

00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:49.201
to the bus and the
first thing that I

00:59:49.201 --> 00:59:52.310
see on the cover of this
journal is a Buddhist quote that

00:59:52.310 --> 00:59:54.170
said, "There is no
way to happiness,

00:59:54.170 --> 00:59:56.120
happiness is the way."

00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:58.370
And it occurred to me that
I'd taken this journey

00:59:58.370 --> 01:00:01.820
to find something at this
bus, as it did by the graffiti

01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:05.120
there hundreds, maybe
thousands of people,

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:06.860
all seeking something.

01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:09.200
But this quote talks
about it being within us.

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:11.180
Can you talk about it
all that has resonated

01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:12.740
with you in your life?

01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:15.260
CARINE MCCANDLESS: That's
it, self-awareness.

01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:17.870
If you don't get away from
that noise of society sometimes

01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:20.060
and you don't have
that self-awareness.

01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:23.510
I mean, it breaks right down
to kids going to college

01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:26.210
or they don't go to college,
they go into a career.

01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:27.710
Are they doing that
they want to do,

01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:30.206
or are they doing what
they were told to do?

01:00:30.206 --> 01:00:31.580
Are they following
their own path

01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:34.880
or are they following a path
that was laid out for them?

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:39.035
It's not just academics,
it's also socially.

01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:45.530
All of these influences that
are all over the internet

01:00:45.530 --> 01:00:48.920
are determining these
paths and these choices

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:52.737
that we all make all the time
and the kids are watching it.

01:00:52.737 --> 01:00:54.570
SACHIT EGAN: A round
of applause for Carine.

01:00:54.570 --> 01:00:55.611
Thank you for being here.

01:00:55.611 --> 01:00:57.920
[APPLAUSE]
