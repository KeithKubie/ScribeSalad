00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:09.440
In July 1945, scientists detonated Trinity,
the world’s first nuclear bomb.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:16.279
At the time, no one was sure what was going
to happen.

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:21.780
But the test was a terrifying success, and
it led to an international arms race.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.860
The United States conducted over 200 atmospheric
weapons tests for two key reasons: grandstanding

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.550
and fine tuning.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.910
They wanted to prove their military might,
and make better, more powerful nuclear weapons.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:41.570
So, they tested out new designs in the air,
on the ground, and at sea.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.940
All of these massive fireballs were captured
by strategically placed cameras around a test

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.510
site, and then analyzed by scientists.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.590
The big number they were all after?

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.430
The yield, or the amount of energy released.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.450
These films hold the best scientific data
we have of our nuclear potential.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.969
That is, until a weapons physicist decades
later found out the data from these films

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.500
might be off a bit.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.080
About 10 years ago, I was asked by my boss
to write this computer code that would predict

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.420
nuclear fallout, and I couldn't seem to get
the answer to agree no matter what I did.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.380
That’s Greg Spriggs, a weapons physicist
with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.909
I kept saying, "I'm not doing anything wrong
in my computer code."

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.869
Typical scientific answer right, it's always
somebody else's fault, not yours."

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.300
For weapons physicists like Greg, computer
codes are everything.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.880
They’re used to verify the thousands of
thermonuclear warheads on standby all across

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.880
the country.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.650
And the original data for those codes came
in part from these films.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.610
That's the benefit of the data.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.640
It provides ground truth to us , the reality,
and it gives everybody a warm fuzzy feeling

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.220
back in Washington.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.140
If it ever comes to a point that we have to
use a nuke, it better work.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.011
So Greg is working on a special project to
scan and reanalyze all of the old films, and

00:01:58.011 --> 00:01:59.869
make sure the data is up to snuff.

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.110
To do that, he had to track down thousands
of Cold War era film canisters.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.061
They’d been sitting in high security vaults
for decades and hadn’t been seen by the

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:09.590
public.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.549
Some of the films had decomposed to the point
where they had turned to dust.

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:17.620
The only way to accurately study these films
is to digitally scan them.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.430
And Greg needed an expert in film preservation.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.169
So he brought in Jim Moye.

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:25.069
For Jim, each film is a mini time capsule.

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.889
It's kind of cool to be opening something
and having no idea what's there.

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:33.829
Jim processes each nuclear film with this
Hollywood-style scanner.

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.810
So far, they’ve digitally scanned over 4,000
films.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.749
Then came the work of analyzing them.

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:44.340
There are four major effects.The first one
I'll call prop radiation.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.939
Greg spends a lot of time watching bombs explode.

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:49.980
These are the prop neutrons or the prop gammas
that are coming off of the fission process.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.440
We’re looking at Housatonic 120256, the
last nuclear shot before all atmospheric testing

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.739
came to a complete stop in 1962.

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.799
The next major effect is what's called the
shockwave//a big, high-density air region

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.790
that is moving through the atmosphere at very
high speed.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.999
Measuring the size of a shock wave over time
can reveal how much energy a bomb releases.

00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:20.400
So this shockwave is moving very, very fast.
and when it hits something ... You could imagine

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.540
standing in a hurricane, having that wind
blowing at you at 200 miles an hour, well

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.680
this is much higher speed.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.879
Back in the 1950s though, the shockwave was
calculated by hand using a device called a

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:32.879
kodagraph.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.569
They projected the film onto a grid and advanced
it frame by frame.

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.790
Scientists we’re doing this manually and
very quickly, a process prone to human error.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.529
we found that some of those yields could be
off by as much as 20% or 30%.

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:50.400
But now, with these films digitized, Greg
can analyze every single pixel in the fireball’s

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.400
edge.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.329
This means for the very first time, we’re
able to get a more accurate sense of a bomb’s

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:56.329
yield.

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:57.859
The next effect was the thermal blast.

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:04.339
When the shock wave moves through the atmosphere
it also heats the air, and that hot air then

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:06.729
starts to radiate thermal energy.

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:08.359
Two pulses emerge from a fireball.

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:14.420
The first pulse happens within 81 milliseconds
and has 0.6% of thermal radiation.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.571
The second carries about 99% of total thermal
radiation energy from the blast.

00:04:19.571 --> 00:04:23.349
Then the fourth major effect, of course, is
nuclear fallout.The films can’t measure

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:27.860
nuclear fallout, but measuring the cloud height
can give experts a sense of the extent of

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:28.860
the damage.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.169
I found that those cloud heights could be
off by as much as 10% or 15%, which makes

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:34.840
a big difference in nuclear fallout.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.189
By pinpointing more precise yields, Greg can
update computer models to estimate the damage

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:41.190
from a bomb in different scenarios.

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.340
Ultimately, they’re perfecting data for
nuclear weapons that will hopefully never

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.530
be used.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.599
Still, the pursuit is worth it.This is something
new, this is what scientists live for, is

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:55.740
to kind of push the frontier forward just
a little bit.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.720
There’s something unnerving about watching
these mushroom clouds.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.090
And while we aren’t testing nuclear weapons
anymore, these films stand as a terrifying

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:25.009
reminder of our nuclear past 
and potential.
