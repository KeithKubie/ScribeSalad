00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.340
So, we found a bunch of huge sci-fi satellite
dish things...on the top of a mountain...in

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.420
Alaska...and they look like this!

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:18.810
And we just figured out why they’re there
and what they do...and it’s really weird!

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.550
Hey everyone, Amy here.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.460
Our friends at Seeker went on a shoot to Alaska
recently, and they came back with a story

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.230
that we just had to tell on DNews.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.529
It’s about a huge, ambitious military project
called White Alice.

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.940
By now the whole thing is barely a footnote
in the history of the Cold War...but 60 years

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.930
ago, it was revolutionary for the military,
and for Alaska.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.410
In order to get why White Alice was so important,
you have to understand a few things about

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.410
Alaska.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.190
First: it’s huge, it’s empty, and it’s
wild.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.190
In the mid 1950’s, it was home to just 215,000
people, spread across an area that’s twice

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.970
the size of Texas.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.940
That made modern communication a pretty big
hassle.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.230
Stringing telegraph or phone lines between
cities meant crossing hundreds of miles of

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.350
rugged, usually frozen terrain.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.210
The huge distances made radio communication
flaky; even high-frequency signals fritzed

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.219
out when the Northern Lights appeared!

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:15.780
This was all a big problem because, during
the Cold War, the US military needed good

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.689
comm networks in Alaska.

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.420
Pearl Harbor was still fresh in everyone’s
mind, and the government feared a far-North

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.450
sneak attack from the Soviets...remember,
Alaska and Russia are 53 miles apart at the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.450
Bering Strait.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.280
It’s such a narrow divide that the region
became known as the “ice curtain”.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.620
The US and Canadian air forces set up a series
of radar listening posts along the Arctic

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.759
Ocean, but they needed a way to relay information
across the state, and fast.

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.709
And that is where White Alice came in.

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:47.380
Beginning in 1955, the Air Force and Army
built a network of communications hubs that

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.650
used a very new technology to connect with
one another.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.220
Phone calls and other data were transmitted
via microwaves, beamed into the air, bounced

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.689
off the Earth’s upper atmosphere, and back
down to a receiving site.

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:03.380
Each hub had two sets of dishes: one set for
receiving a signal, and another for broadcasting

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.979
it back out to the next hub.

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.670
The process, called “tropospheric scattering”,
had (and still has) a lot of advantages over

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.009
other technologies.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.170
First, bouncing signals off the upper atmosphere
means that hubs don’t need a clear line

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.680
of site to communicate...which is a useful
thing in a mountainous place like Alaska.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.000
This way, White Alice sites could be 200 miles
apart.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.370
The signal could also support multiple phone
calls at the same time, something few other

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.920
systems could manage.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.930
And, crucially for the military, it was secure.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.400
Once a signal is beamed out, it can only be
received at one exact spot - making it next

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.700
to impossible to intercept the signal along
the way.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.690
All in all, the military built 22 tropospheric
scattering sites across Alaska, eventually

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.440
spending around $300 million dollars.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.780
And it wasn’t alone.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.829
Similar networks sprung up around the world
- the US even connected Hawaii to the Philippines

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:56.080
through the Pacific Scatter System.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.220
But it might have had the biggest impact on
Alaska, uniting the new state in ways that

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.140
no other technology could have.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.550
But...before White Alice was even complete,
a new technology arrived to replace it.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.219
In 1957 the Soviets launched Sputnik 1, the
world’s first artificial satellite.

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:17.300
US development of satellite communications
ramped up, and by 1967, just 8 years after

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.939
the network’s completion, the government
began to divest from the very system it built.

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:26.640
Interestingly, White Alice remained in use
until the late ‘70s as a civilian phone

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.640
network.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.319
And today, the military still uses tropo scattering
networks here and there...because they’re

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:32.609
still really secure.

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.709
But this remains the era of satellites.

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.579
Now, the reason we have all this footage is
that the White Alice hub outside of Nome still

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:45.859
stands today...it’s one of the last tropo
scattering sites in Alaska to escape demolition.

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:50.430
The electronics there are long dead, but the
structures themselves still serve a final

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.430
purpose: they’re unmistakable landmarks,
visible for miles.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:02.409
And they still help hunters and travelers
out on the tundra find their way home to Nome.

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:06.260
Like I mentioned earlier, this story came
out of a much larger trip to the Bering Strait

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.140
- and the Seeker Daily team has a great video
about how the whole world might need the Strait

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.140
soon.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:24.780

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.240
And as always, thanks for watching.
