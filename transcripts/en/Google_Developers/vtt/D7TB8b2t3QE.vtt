00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:02.690
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Hey, Vic, I’ve got a really
cool event for you.
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Sergey!

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.140
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: How are you doing?

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:11.140
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Guys, we -- we're going to
-- we're going to do something pretty magical

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:14.669
here. And we have a special surprise for you.

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:17.360
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: We have something pretty special
for you. It's a little bit time-sensitive,

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.790
so I apologize for interrupting. You've seen
some really compelling demos here.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:28.210
They were slick, they were robust. This is
going to be nothing like that.
[ Laughter ]

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.329
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: This can go wrong in about
500 different ways. So tell me now, who wants

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.329
to see a demo of Glass?
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:47.920
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: So we've been really excited
to test it for a few months. The unit I actually

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:55.010
really want to show you, I lent to a friend,
and he's going to be here momentarily. My friend's J.T.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:01.690
He does a lot of skiing, base jumping, wingsuiting,
all sorts of crazy things. And he's actually

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.120
pretty close by. He's just about a mile overhead
right now.
[ Laughter ]

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.300
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: -- with his buddies they have
a few Glass units. If you guys can maybe afford

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.500
to wait that couple of minutes.
[ Applause ]

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.810
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Maybe they'll bring them down.
&gt;&gt;&gt; They're cheering for us.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.930
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: All right. We're about to get
into a Hangout here with J.T.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.150
Hey, J.T., J.T., can you hear me?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.000
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Hello, hello. We might have
a few technical issues.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.820
&gt;&gt;&gt; Can you hear me?

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.460
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Yeah, yeah. Hey, we're just
down here in Moscone. I’ve got a few thousand people here.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.250
I was hoping to maybe get that unit that I
lent you down here. And I thought maybe you

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.980
guys could show us a fun time on the way down.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.730
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you can hear me down there. I've
been listening to your speech through the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.320
Hangout. It's pretty cool.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.930
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Cool, cool.
I see you and friends are in a plane close-by there.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.250
Any chance we can get a view out the window?

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.270
&gt;&gt;&gt; Heck, yeah. It's beautiful, we had a visual
on Moscone a minute ago.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.740
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: All right. This is a Hangout from Glass.
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.840
&gt;&gt;&gt; Look at that!
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.990
&gt;&gt;&gt; Coming a little closer. I think we're
going to get you that device pretty quickly, actually.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:26.300
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: I see the roof of Moscone there.
So if you guys can, you know, be safe, but

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.440
get it down here in a hurry for us, we'd love
to watch that.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.260
&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah, you'll have to standby. We've
got our wing suits. So we've got a pretty

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.510
good range. It's kind of interesting. People
have watched us fly many times before.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:48.510
But I don't think that the world's ever tagged
along live for a ride. I mean, we're --

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.629
nobody really knows the outcome of this jump. We're
feeling really confident about it.
[ Laughter ]

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.060
&gt;&gt;&gt; How are you feeling, Pete?

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.660
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: We're all rooting for you.
What do you guys think, should they go for it?
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.349
&gt;&gt;&gt; Not in position yet. About one minute,
Sergey. Maybe you've got to entertain the crowd a little.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.560
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: That looks like the view down,
that looks like a long way down.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:23.730
&gt;&gt;&gt; Turn it sideways.
&gt;&gt;&gt; There's the ballpark.
&gt;&gt;&gt; This is good. Stop here.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, Moscone center. I've got a visual on you.
[ Laughter ]

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.390
&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: So this is one of the things,
as we've been experimenting with Glass, just

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.770
the ability to really share. And we've posted
some pictures.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:38.050
But as we start to experiment, being able
to share what you're seeing live is really amazing.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.989
And, you know, we're not -- we don't know
what's going to happen here. These guys are

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:48.830
all really good. They're trained. And I have
great confidence. But this is -- this is a demo that --
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.070
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: All right. Door's open. Door's
open.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:00.680
&gt;&gt;&gt; Let's -- we've got time.
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: All right. Happy flight!

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.680
&gt;&gt;&gt; You know what? We can jump.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Let's do it. It's going to be beautiful.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.690
&gt;&gt;&gt; It's going to be perfect.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah! Look at that!
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: All right.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:18.690
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yooo! San Francisco!
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:26.340
&gt;&gt;&gt; All right. Everybody's super happy.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Nice and close-in there.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:33.230
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: They've got to get to the right
place so they can hit the roof.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.030
&gt;&gt;&gt; Three, two --

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:41.940
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: I'm going to take a few pictures
to record this for posterity. And they're off!
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:48.940
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: All right. And they're flying.
Look at that, look at that. You can see Moscone

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.060
right below there.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:03.060
Live Hangout, through Google Glass. Four skydivers.
And they're under canopy. Chutes are open.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.820
Woo-hoo!
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:27.710
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Okay. Where's Vic. Vic, hey,
look, this is a Hangout On Air.
[ Laughter ]

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.930
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: So it's a little bit tricky
landing on a building, as you might imagine.

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.169
I don't know if you have ever tried this kind
of thing before.

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:42.669
But you can see all their perspectives now.
They're going to have to line up one after

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:47.479
another to get down to the roof here.

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:54.479
It's a little bit of a -- it's a pretty big
roof, actually, which is great for their landing.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:01.360
And you can see there's -- there's a little
yellow arrow they're aiming for.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.310
It's pretty exciting. Hopefully, they land it.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:13.310
All right. And they're coming in. First one's
coming in.

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:15.860
&gt;&gt;&gt; Woo-hoo!

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:22.860
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: All right.
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:34.229
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Yeah!
[ Applause ]

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:41.229
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: So, okay, folks, thank you.
Woo-hoo!

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:49.870
Hey, so the roof is a little bit big there,
so it would take a while to run down the length of it.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:54.360
So we got, actually, a few bikers up
there for this eventuality.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:01.360
We’ve got them wearing Glass, too. And there's
our little package. Let's see if we can --

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.330
let's see if we can get it here in a hurry.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:11.330
Here we go. First person with Glass, here
are the bikers.

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:19.830
Yeah! Woo-hoo! Here they come down.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:26.590
And, you know, there's only one good way down
the side of a building.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:34.720
&gt;&gt;&gt; Have fun.
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: It's pretty high up there if
you haven't been there before. Don't try this

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.310
at home, kids. These are trained professionals.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:41.660
&gt;&gt;&gt; All right. Now we've got to get down there.
Wanna unplug me?

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:48.550
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: All right, they're going.
Wait, wait wait wait, whoa, whoa, whoa! No,

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:54.229
we’re on the third --
Okay. Close call.

00:07:54.229 --> 00:08:00.650
Sorry about that.
So this is pretty wild.

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:07.400
I've never seen that perspective before.
And --

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.020
&gt;&gt;&gt; Special delivery. Bring that to Sergey.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:15.840
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: We still have a couple of bikes.
Its a little bit of a long way. I apologize.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.880
[Laughter]

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.100
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Don't run anybody over!
[ Cheers and Applause ]

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:28.100
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: All right. Please stay in your
seats, folks. Don't get into the aisles.

00:08:34.649 --> 00:08:39.789
Please keep the aisles clear. Here they come up.
[ Cheers and Applause ]

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:43.060
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Yeah! Woo-hoo!
[ Cheers and Applause ]

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:49.140
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Yeah. That was awesome.
All right. That was pretty amazing.
[ Applause ]

00:08:49.140 --> 00:09:01.570
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: All right. A big round of applause
for our bikers.
[ Cheers and Applause ]

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:08.570
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: I'll get a little picture of
you there with my Glass.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:17.640
All right. We've got -- I just wanted to -- some
of our athletes who are performers I wanted

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.600
to give them another big round of applause.
We have the rappellers in the back. And --

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:20.850
[ Applause ]

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:27.730
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: It takes a little while.
And we've got the -- let's see.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:42.420
And the skydivers should be close behind them. Thank you so
much. That was amazing.
[ Applause ]

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:54.420
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Okay. All right. Thanks, guys.
[ Cheers and Applause ]

00:09:55.620 --> 00:10:09.019
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: All right. Now maybe we should
-- well, all right. Come on up, guys. You're
already here. Come on up, take a bow.
[ Cheers and Applause ]

00:10:09.019 --> 00:10:16.019
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: These are the rappellers, all
the bikers you saw up there.

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:24.430
And there's the sky diving crew coming down the aisle.
[ Cheers and Applause ]

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:34.450
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Hey, J.T., that was amazing.
We were worried about you. That was awesome.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:42.640
All right, thank you all so much.
Now maybe we should tell you a little bit about Glass.
[Laughter]

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.370
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: All right, guys, have fun.
You can meet them.

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:50.480
They'll be out and around if you want to chat with them.
Thank you so much.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:56.200
Now, here's what -- no, no. This is the wrong
one.
[Laughter]

00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:00.269
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: I think we have to do it again.
[Laughter]

00:11:00.269 --> 00:11:01.750
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd be happy to.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:05.360
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: We'll find the time. We actually
might have the time.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:12.350
If you want to see behind the scenes and maybe catch some of that activity
on -- through Hangout, tune in tomorrow.

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:17.790
But now I just want to tell you a bit about
how we made that happen and why we're so excited

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:21.449
about Glass, and to tell you that I have Babak
and Isabelle. Please welcome them aboard.

00:11:21.449 --> 00:11:25.699
[ Applause ]
