00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now we want to put numbers to gravitation.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Do this in 2D, which means we need to have vectors.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Let's place the earth at the origin.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The moon sits at a vector xm.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The spacecraft sits at a vector xs, and we need the distance of the spacecraft from the moon.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Let's call that dms,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and we need the distance of the spacecraft from the earth.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Let's call that des.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Now we can put both of Newton's laws together.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The mass of the space craft times its acceleration, as a vector now,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
equals the force that is exerted on the spacecraft.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And this force stems from gravity.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
It has two components.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
One is the force that is exerted by the earth.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The other is the force exerted by the moon.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So, the force exerted by the earth would be gravitational constant times

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
the mass of the earth times the mass of the spacecraft divided by the distance

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
between them squared times a unit vector, that is, vector of length one

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
pointing to earth -- something like this.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And for the moon, we get the gravitational constant times the mass of the moon

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
times the mass of the spacecraft divided by the distance between them squared

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
times a unit vector pointing to the moon.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So how do we get these two vectors?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
For the first one we can take minus xs --

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
that's a vector that takes us from the spacecraft to earth --

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and divide by the length of xs, which is nothing but des.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000
For the second one, we can take the difference vector xm mines xs --

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
that's the vector that has its tail at the spacecraft

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and its tip at the moon -- and we divide by the length of that vector,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
which is the distance from the moon to the spacecraft.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Now, let's forget about the force.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Then we see that the mass of the spacecraft cancels.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.364
What we need to know are the mass of the earth and the mass of the moon.
