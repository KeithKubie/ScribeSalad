00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:04.620
 In the film Self / Less, which will be shown on July 10, Mr. Ben Kingsley moves his consciousness 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.230
 To the body of Ryan Reynolds in an attempt to stay alive forever and become virtually immortal. 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.470
 In a process called 'projection' which looks really wonderful 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.600
 I mean who does not want extra time to realize his dreams with a young body of his choice? 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.310
 Try to become a professional athlete or solve the biggest dilemmas of the world. 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.470
 But is the projection process realistic? Can you become immortal in this way? 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.869
 First, you must understand how memories are stored. Your brain is a mass of 3 lb (1.5 kg) 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.880
 Of a lipid tissue containing 86 billion brain cells called neurons. Electricity 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.390
 Or chemicals between them, neurons can send signals to each other. Most neuroscientists believe 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.930
 That memory is stored as a network of neurons that form connections between them. 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.140
 They all work at the same time. Every time memory is recalled, that network of neurons works together. 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.910
 In fact, scientists have shown that some parts of the brain are electrified, 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.309
 It is possible to make someone remember some memories 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.000
 For example, the smell of toast. 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.950
 To carry a memory, we can simply follow the path of the neurons that are activated when you think about them. 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.310
 As we explained in the previous video, scientists have done so. 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.799
 Using computers to simulate these patterns of activated neurons with real images 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.549
 Or scenes, we can read people's minds to a limited degree. 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.650
 Many scientists believe that someday it will become possible 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.710
 Find a map of all the neurons in the brain and the links that connect them. This map will be called Connectedum. 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.390
 The United States and the European Union have launched massive research programs 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.880
 This particular goal is taken into consideration, such as the organizations in Self / Less. 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.869
 This task will probably take decades, but when it ends, scientists will be able to build 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.470
 A working computer model, you can consider it as a virtual brain that allows signal transmission 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.140
 Between neurons through artificial nerve clamps. 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.720
 If downloading memories is possible, what about introducing them? This also comes close to being a fact 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.259
 With a technique called photoreceptor. This involves injecting certain neurons 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.619
 With a nucleic acid of algae that produces a light-sensitive protein on the surface of its cells. 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.009
 When the brain is highlighted, the protein stimulates and activates only the neurons involved. 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.979
 In this way, scientists can artificially activate cells to group neurons 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.540
 Associated with specific memories. 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.049
 This all sounds really scary, and it may make you think that a scenario like this is the one that's introduced in 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:20.219
 A Self / Less film may not be out of reach. But there are some reasons to make you comfortable. 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:25.150
 Our brains are incredibly complex, perhaps so complex that you can not copy. 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.609
 The number of clamps is 1,000 times greater than the number of stars in the Milky Way galaxy. 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:35.379
 Above all, your brain is constantly reworking itself, creating new and active links 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:40.439
 The old ones are gone. It is the reflection of you at this moment of time, 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:42.889
 It took the time of your whole life to be found. 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:48.120
 A copy of your mind will be just a tradition. And the moment it begins 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.029
 By incorporating ideas, memories and experiences, he will become someone else. Which helps us in some way 

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:58.010
 How much we are unique. But with increasingly sophisticated technology, 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.299
 Who knows what the future holds for us! Perhaps such a world in Self / Less is not too far away. 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.859
 Be sure to watch the movie that will be on July 10 - we will be there 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:07.980
 We will be excited to hear your opinion.
