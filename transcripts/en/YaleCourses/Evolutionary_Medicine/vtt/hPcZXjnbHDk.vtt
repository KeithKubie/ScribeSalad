00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:06.710
The aspect of pathogen evolution that probably has the most serious consequences

2
00:00:08.221 --> 00:00:12.090
for clinical medicine is the evolution of antibiotic resistance.

3
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.190
Pathogens very rapidly evolve resistance to antibiotics resistant infections are

4
00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:22.440
killing thousands of people every year.

5
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.910
Modern surgery depends on having effective antibiotics so that people can

6
00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:33.510
recover from surgery.
The drug pipeline is drying up,

7
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.680
so it's serious.
This is a major issue,

8
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.540
so first resistance evolves very rapidly.

9
00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:47.541
Here are the timelines of introducing various antibiotics.

10
00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:50.370
The year introduced the year that resistance was observed,

11
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.910
penicillin introduced in 1943 resistance observed in 1945 chloramphenicol

12
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.140
introduced in 1949 resistance observed in 1950 arithromycin introduced in 1952

13
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.460
resistance observed in 1956 you can read down the rest.

14
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.330
The point is that resistance evolves rapidly every time a new antibiotic is

15
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:21.210
introduced.
Now to put things in perspective,

16
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.240
this is the mortality rate per hundred thousand people per year in the United

17
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.293
States.

18
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.570
Starting in 1900 and going through to about 1990 there's a big spike here from

19
00:01:33.271 --> 00:01:38.271
the 1918 influenza epidemic and you can see that mortality was actually dropping

20
00:01:39.481 --> 00:01:44.481
quite a bit before penicillin was introduced in 1943 so if we lost our ability

21
00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:52.170
to treat infectious disease with antibiotics,

22
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.520
mortality levels might rise back up to about here,

23
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.260
but they would not go back to here.
So it is serious,

24
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.380
but it won't take us back to the 19th century.

25
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.730
It will take us back to the 1940s
now,

26
00:02:08.731 --> 00:02:10.440
what are antibiotics?

27
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.580
They are actually quite a heterogeneous class of molecules that interfere with

28
00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:21.570
the growth and reproduction of bacteria.
Many of them occur naturally.

29
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.020
Many of them are in the soil and they are isolated from bacteria and fungi,

30
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.720
which evolved them for purposes of co-evolutionary interaction and competition,

31
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.410
mostly in the soil naturally occurring.

32
00:02:37.411 --> 00:02:41.010
Antibiotics are then often modified to make them more effective.

33
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.660
Some of them are synthetic and they may have no natural counterpart,

34
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.670
so how do they work and what is their objective?

35
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.670
They work by mimicking a critical molecule or by blocking an active site by

36
00:02:56.671 --> 00:03:01.671
binding to it irreversibly and competing with a naturally occurring molecule for

37
00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:04.420
binding passage or pet or transport.

38
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.590
Their objective is to kill or to slow the growth of the target organism and to

39
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:14.230
do so with minimal toxicity to the patient.

40
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.930
So antibiotics are designed to target a unique feature of the pathogen that is

41
00:03:21.121 --> 00:03:22.620
not shared by the host.

42
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.330
This is much easier to do if the pathogen is a pro karaoke than if it's a

43
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.213
eukaryote.

44
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.850
<v 1>Okay.</v>

45
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.830
<v 0>It's hard to do this for helmets,</v>

46
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.220
and that is why anti helminthic drugs are often toxic to humans is because warm

47
00:03:38.691 --> 00:03:40.890
cells are fairly similar to human cells.

48
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.100
Now,

49
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.100
bacteria can acquire resistance genes through any of three mechanisms of

50
00:03:50.551 --> 00:03:55.380
horizontal transfer.
They can also acquire resistance by mutating,

51
00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.890
but more often they acquire resistance by getting the genes from a huge library

52
00:04:01.141 --> 00:04:03.300
of genetic information that's already out there.

53
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.290
One of the ways of doing it is through transformation,

54
00:04:07.291 --> 00:04:10.860
so they take up free DNA here.
A,

55
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.870
B R is standing for antibiotic resistance determinant and they can recode,

56
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:22.050
incorporate it into their circular chromosome so they can actually eat DNA and

57
00:04:22.231 --> 00:04:26.340
the environment,
often they would just use it as it is a nutrient,

58
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.640
but sometimes they can incorporate it into their circular chromosome.

59
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.750
The second way that they can get information is by transduction.

60
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.880
That's done when a virus that attacks bacteria,
bacteria,

61
00:04:38.881 --> 00:04:43.200
phage picks up some of the bacterial DNA,

62
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.290
incorporates it into its own DNA,

63
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.830
brings that antibiotic resistance determinant along with it and inserts it by

64
00:04:53.311 --> 00:04:57.090
transposition into the bacterial chromosome.

65
00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.260
So it's using all of the genetic machinery that it has evolved to transport its

66
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.600
own genetic information and it uses it to bring along some of the bacterial

67
00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:14.040
information with it.
The third way is through conjugation.

68
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.230
So in this case,

69
00:05:16.231 --> 00:05:20.790
the antibiotic resistant determinant is encoded in a plasmid,

70
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.340
which is a little piece of circular DNA,

71
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.790
which is in the bacterial cell and the plasmid induces conjugation so that so

72
00:05:30.271 --> 00:05:33.120
that it can be horizontally transferred.

73
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.660
So plasmids contain other jeans besides the antibiotic resistance determinants

74
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.100
that tell the bacteria to turn on the bacterial equivalent of sex,

75
00:05:44.101 --> 00:05:45.270
which is conjugation,

76
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.500
and to transmit the plasma is horizontally into another bacterium.

77
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.963
There,

78
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.350
there can be transposition and recombination and the antibiotic resistance

79
00:05:55.351 --> 00:05:59.600
determinant can move from the into the bacterial circular chromosome.

80
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.320
So there are actually three fairly well developed mechanisms by which bacteria

81
00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:10.310
can move information on antibiotic resistance horizontally.

82
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:18.550
This horizontal transfer has produced things that look like this multidrug

83
00:06:18.741 --> 00:06:21.840
resistance complex in Salmonella typhimurium.

84
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.780
So here there you can see there is an integrate,

85
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:31.190
which is part of the transposon on facility.
That's how the

86
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.410
whole complex gets integrated into the circular chromosome.

87
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.800
That's a recombination site in a common promoter.

88
00:06:39.801 --> 00:06:44.690
And then in the complex we have substrates for a number of different antibiotic

89
00:06:44.691 --> 00:06:47.090
resistance determinants.
We,

90
00:06:47.091 --> 00:06:51.380
there is a a marvelous thing called Quacky Delta,

91
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:56.710
which actually is a general membrane pump that pumps toxins out of the bacterial

92
00:06:56.871 --> 00:07:00.380
cell.
It will even pump soap out of the bacterial cell.

93
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.100
And here's a gene that provides resistance for so fundaments.

94
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:09.670
So this entire battery of genetic information can be moved on a plasmid and

95
00:07:10.131 --> 00:07:12.500
incorporated in a new bacterium.

96
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:15.660
Now,

97
00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:20.660
one of the really important ideas coming from evolutionary biology into the

98
00:07:22.471 --> 00:07:25.980
study of antibiotic resistance is on this slide,

99
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.830
bacterial genetics have important implications for therapy.

100
00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:33.560
The critical issue is this,

101
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:39.160
do the genes for drug resistance exist in the pathogen population prior to the

102
00:07:39.681 --> 00:07:44.681
infection or do they originate through mutation after infection begins?

103
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:50.390
And here's why it's important.
If the former,
that is,

104
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:55.070
if the genes for drug resistance are there at the beginning of the infection,

105
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:59.540
then strong,
prolonged antibiotic treatment rapidly selects for resistance

106
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.050
if the ladder,
in other words,

107
00:08:03.051 --> 00:08:05.630
if they're not there at the beginning and they're going to evolve through

108
00:08:05.631 --> 00:08:06.464
mutation,

109
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:11.630
then treatment reduces the size of the pathogen population and the probability

110
00:08:11.631 --> 00:08:13.730
that a resistant mutation will occur.

111
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:20.470
So it's really critical to hit to know whether or not the genes for resistance

112
00:08:20.871 --> 00:08:25.760
or there in the bacterial population at the start or whether the evolve by

113
00:08:25.761 --> 00:08:26.660
mutation later

114
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:32.330
traditional therapies assume that resistance arises through mutations.

115
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.780
They are wrong.
They are at least often wrong.

116
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:41.810
That assumption is the basis for recommending that patients finish their

117
00:08:41.811 --> 00:08:43.970
prescriptions.
However,

118
00:08:43.971 --> 00:08:48.971
evidence suggests that most infections already contain pathogens with resistant

119
00:08:49.941 --> 00:08:50.774
genes.

120
00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:56.100
And in that case we could slow the evolution of resistance by using enough

121
00:08:56.101 --> 00:08:59.550
antibiotic to control the infection rather than buying,

122
00:08:59.551 --> 00:09:02.820
trying to eliminate it by trying to eliminate it.

123
00:09:02.821 --> 00:09:07.821
We are essentially taking out the susceptible clones and we are leaving the

124
00:09:08.791 --> 00:09:10.500
resistance strains to multiply.

125
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.970
We're clearing out the competition and making it actually a more comfortable

126
00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:18.360
environment for the resistant strains to exist in.

127
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.650
So by letting the immune system then finish the job,

128
00:09:22.651 --> 00:09:25.470
we could slow or avoid the evolution of resistance.

129
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:31.700
So the idea is just to keep the infection under control long enough to allow the

130
00:09:32.431 --> 00:09:33.780
immune system to knock it out.

131
00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:41.410
Much antibiotic use is unnecessary,
inappropriate or questionable.

132
00:09:41.411 --> 00:09:44.950
And that's why antibiotic resistance evolves so quickly.

133
00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:48.190
There are unnecessary prescriptions,

134
00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:53.770
all antibiotic prescriptions for the common cold or unnecessary.

135
00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:55.053
They do no good.

136
00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.010
80% of prescriptions for bronchitis or unnecessary,

137
00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:06.150
50% of prescriptions for sore throat are unnecessary and 50% of prescriptions

138
00:10:07.751 --> 00:10:09.850
for sinusitis or unnecessary.

139
00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:15.390
So antibiotics don't work for viral infections.

140
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:17.220
And they are often misprescribed.

141
00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.580
That's also the case for 30% of ear infections.

142
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:27.170
Then there's questionable use.

143
00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:32.240
50% of antibiotics are used in agriculture.

144
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:37.630
That's 25 million pounds of antibiotics each year used in agriculture.

145
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:45.430
80% of it is either prophylactic or growth promoting and all of that enhances

146
00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:48.230
resistance evolution.

147
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:53.350
There's simply an awful lot of antibiotic out there in the environment causing

148
00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:56.390
the evolution of resistance that doesn't need to be there.

149
00:10:57.930 --> 00:10:58.520
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

150
00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:02.840
<v 0>so to avoid or delay the evolution of resistance,
what can we do?</v>

151
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:07.460
We can reduce the infection rate by avoiding undercooked eggs and meat by

152
00:11:07.461 --> 00:11:09.860
washing our hands to slow disease spread.

153
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:16.060
Those are fairly straight forward and actually most hospitals now have very good

154
00:11:16.071 --> 00:11:18.530
protocols in place for hand washing.

155
00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:24.090
We can limit the use of antibiotic bacterial soaps and cleaners.

156
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:28.800
They are not usually necessary and they simply provide another opportunity for

157
00:11:28.801 --> 00:11:31.530
selection to act to select resistance.

158
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:32.950
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

159
00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:37.950
<v 0>we can avoid prescribing antibiotics for viral infections that actually will</v>

160
00:11:38.141 --> 00:11:43.141
require both physicians and patients to realize that antibiotics don't do any

161
00:11:44.231 --> 00:11:46.360
good if the infection is a virus.

162
00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:48.160
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

163
00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.250
<v 0>we can eliminate antibiotic use in animal feed,</v>

164
00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:55.620
and all of these approaches are only partially effective.

165
00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.320
They don't really solve the problem completely.

166
00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:01.460
<v 1>So to summarize,</v>

167
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:05.200
<v 0>microbial pathogens rapidly evolve resistance,</v>

168
00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:10.300
especially in emergency rooms and intensive care units where they are used

169
00:12:10.301 --> 00:12:11.134
frequently.

170
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:12.950
<v 1>Okay.</v>

171
00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:13.290
<v 0>No,
sir.</v>

172
00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:18.290
Camiel infections of multiply resistant pathogens kill more patients each year

173
00:12:18.831 --> 00:12:21.380
than breast cancer and HIV combined.

174
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:24.020
Those are infections where people went into the hospital,

175
00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:26.330
they acquired the infection in the hospital

176
00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:27.660
<v 1>and they were killed by it.</v>

177
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:34.340
<v 0>The genes for resistance often evolved long ago and far away from any</v>

178
00:12:34.341 --> 00:12:35.960
interaction with human beings.

179
00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:38.210
They have been recovered from the bones of mammoths.

180
00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:42.920
They have been recovered thousands of miles from any medical center in wild

181
00:12:42.921 --> 00:12:43.754
animals.

182
00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:45.540
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

183
00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.870
<v 0>Every new drug becomes ineffective within a few years,</v>

184
00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:51.120
and the drug pipeline is drying up.

185
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:53.000
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

186
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.470
<v 0>Resistance strains have become increasingly prevalent due to unnecessary,</v>

187
00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.410
inappropriate and questionable use of antibiotics

188
00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.900
<v 1>in both medicine and in agriculture.</v>
