diseases and the interface between
infectious disease and immunology so you

00:07:24.079 --> 00:07:24.089
infectious disease and immunology so you
 

00:07:24.089 --> 00:07:26.869

what we're thinking about now in the

what we're thinking about now in the

vaccine which I hope we will it will be
 

01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:48.970
vaccine which I hope we will it will be
one of the combinations importantly is

01:01:48.970 --> 01:01:48.980
one of the combinations importantly is
 

01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:51.730
one of the combinations importantly is
this treatment as prevention so every

01:01:51.730 --> 01:01:51.740
this treatment as prevention so every
 

01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:54.550
this treatment as prevention so every
time you treat an HIV infected

01:01:54.550 --> 01:01:54.560
time you treat an HIV infected
 

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:57.829

a potential spreader of infection so the

01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:01.680
a potential spreader of infection so the
 

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:03.859
a potential spreader of infection so the
days of the tension between treatment

01:02:03.859 --> 01:02:03.869
days of the tension between treatment
 

01:02:03.869 --> 01:02:06.519
days of the tension between treatment
and prevention should be put behind us

01:02:06.519 --> 01:02:06.529
and prevention should be put behind us
 

01:02:06.529 --> 01:02:10.339
and prevention should be put behind us
so this is a picture of me last week at

01:02:10.339 --> 01:02:10.349
so this is a picture of me last week at
 

01:02:10.349 --> 01:02:13.839

01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:29.490
too much to affect that no that's
 

01:08:29.490 --> 01:08:30.890
too much to affect that no that's
actually my interrupt is just for a

01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:30.900
actually my interrupt is just for a
 

01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:33.440
actually my interrupt is just for a
second that treatment as prevention is

01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:33.450
second that treatment as prevention is
 

01:08:33.450 --> 01:08:36.620
second that treatment as prevention is
when you treat an infected that's right

01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:36.630
when you treat an infected that's right
 

01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:39.320
when you treat an infected that's right
that was from that Co identify soil I

01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:39.330
that was from that Co identify soil I
 

01:08:39.330 --> 01:08:41.060
that was from that Co identify soil I
don't understand what you mean that it

01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:41.070
don't understand what you mean that it
 

01:08:41.070 --> 01:08:42.770
don't understand what you mean that it
doesn't work any treated person

01:08:42.770 --> 01:08:42.780
doesn't work any treated person
 

01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:44.690
doesn't work any treated person
regardless of who that person is if you

01:08:44.690 --> 01:08:44.700
regardless of who that person is if you
 

01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:46.040
regardless of who that person is if you
treat them you're gonna decrease their

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:46.050
treat them you're gonna decrease their
 

01:08:46.050 --> 01:08:47.599
treat them you're gonna decrease their
chance for sure but you'd have to

01:08:47.599 --> 01:08:47.609
chance for sure but you'd have to
 

01:08:47.609 --> 01:08:49.700
chance for sure but you'd have to
blanket the entire hiv-positive

01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:49.710
blanket the entire hiv-positive
 

01:08:49.710 --> 01:08:51.500
blanket the entire hiv-positive
population including those who are of

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:51.510
population including those who are of
 

01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:53.990
population including those who are of
course no no you're absolutely right if

01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000
course no no you're absolutely right if
 

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.840
course no no you're absolutely right if
you wanted in and of itself to decrease

01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:56.850
you wanted in and of itself to decrease
 

01:08:56.850 --> 01:08:58.700
you wanted in and of itself to decrease
the epidemic we don't have the resources

01:08:58.700 --> 01:08:58.710
the epidemic we don't have the resources
 

01:08:58.710 --> 01:09:01.520
the epidemic we don't have the resources
to blanket the entire population so

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:01.530
to blanket the entire population so
 

01:09:01.530 --> 01:09:03.620
to blanket the entire population so
that's not gonna work alone sure I'm

01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:03.630
that's not gonna work alone sure I'm
 

01:09:03.630 --> 01:09:07.090
that's not gonna work alone sure I'm
just saying that as a scientific fact

01:09:07.090 --> 01:09:07.100
just saying that as a scientific fact
 

01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:11.329
just saying that as a scientific fact
when you treat an infected person you

01:09:11.329 --> 01:09:11.339
when you treat an infected person you
 

01:09:11.339 --> 01:09:15.110
when you treat an infected person you
make that person extremely unlikely to

01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:15.120
make that person extremely unlikely to
 

01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:17.990
make that person extremely unlikely to
infect someone else so whether we have

01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000
infect someone else so whether we have
 

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.180
infect someone else so whether we have
the resources to penetrate entire

01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:20.190
the resources to penetrate entire
 

01:09:20.190 --> 01:09:22.670
the resources to penetrate entire
populations is an entirely different

01:09:22.670 --> 01:09:22.680
populations is an entirely different
 

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:25.610
populations is an entirely different
question yeah I was just addressing the

01:09:25.610 --> 01:09:25.620
question yeah I was just addressing the
 

01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:28.880
question yeah I was just addressing the
scientific credibility of that approach

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:28.890
scientific credibility of that approach
 

01:09:28.890 --> 01:09:31.310
scientific credibility of that approach
great I just have but I actually have a

01:09:31.310 --> 01:09:31.320
great I just have but I actually have a
 

01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:33.020
great I just have but I actually have a
question I wonder which is which is

01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:33.030
question I wonder which is which is
 

01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:35.780
question I wonder which is which is
really I didn't mean to get sidetracked

01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:35.790
really I didn't mean to get sidetracked
 

01:09:35.790 --> 01:09:38.360
really I didn't mean to get sidetracked
on that of course it works you reduce

01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:38.370
on that of course it works you reduce
 

01:09:38.370 --> 01:09:40.340
on that of course it works you reduce
viral load you reduce transmission we

01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:40.350
viral load you reduce transmission we
 

01:09:40.350 --> 01:09:41.599
viral load you reduce transmission we
know that we know that we've known that

01:09:41.599 --> 01:09:41.609
know that we know that we've known that
 

01:09:41.609 --> 01:09:44.329
know that we know that we've known that
since about mother to child transmission

01:09:44.329 --> 01:09:44.339
since about mother to child transmission
 

01:09:44.339 --> 01:09:47.030
since about mother to child transmission
which works the same way of course no

01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040
which works the same way of course no
 

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:50.740
which works the same way of course no
question about that but we do know that

01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:50.750
question about that but we do know that
 

01:09:50.750 --> 01:09:53.690
question about that but we do know that
there are now nine studies using genetic

01:09:53.690 --> 01:09:53.700
there are now nine studies using genetic
 

01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:55.280
there are now nine studies using genetic
linkage and other techniques that show

01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:55.290
linkage and other techniques that show
 

01:09:55.290 --> 01:09:57.230
linkage and other techniques that show
that multiple concurrent partnerships in

01:09:57.230 --> 01:09:57.240
that multiple concurrent partnerships in
 

01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:58.790
that multiple concurrent partnerships in
other words most infections or a

01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800
other words most infections or a
 

01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:00.560
other words most infections or a
significant fraction of infections in

01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:00.570
significant fraction of infections in
 

01:10:00.570 --> 01:10:03.410
significant fraction of infections in
Africa are actually happening in clearly

01:10:03.410 --> 01:10:03.420
Africa are actually happening in clearly
 

01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:05.360
Africa are actually happening in clearly
defined couples that we actually have

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:05.370
defined couples that we actually have
 

01:10:05.370 --> 01:10:12.290
defined couples that we actually have
this but that multiple concurrent

01:10:12.290 --> 01:10:12.300
this but that multiple concurrent
 

01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:14.230
this but that multiple concurrent
partnerships in particular are

01:10:14.230 --> 01:10:14.240
partnerships in particular are
 

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:16.100
partnerships in particular are
responsible for a large amount of the

01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:16.110
responsible for a large amount of the
 

01:10:16.110 --> 01:10:17.810
responsible for a large amount of the
spread and yet there are very few

01:10:17.810 --> 01:10:17.820
spread and yet there are very few
 

01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:19.880
spread and yet there are very few
interventions which actually address

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:19.890
interventions which actually address
 

01:10:19.890 --> 01:10:23.030
interventions which actually address
this particular behavior when you talk

01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040
this particular behavior when you talk
 

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:24.590
this particular behavior when you talk
about targeting this is extremely

01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:24.600
about targeting this is extremely
 

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:26.780
about targeting this is extremely
important and there have been no with

01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:26.790
important and there have been no with
 

01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:28.520
important and there have been no with
one except there have been no randomized

trials of interventions that address
 

01:10:30.690 --> 01:10:32.480
trials of interventions that address
this behavior except for one which is as

this behavior except for one which is as
yet unpublished and actually reduced

01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:34.350
yet unpublished and actually reduced
 

01:10:34.350 --> 01:10:36.920
yet unpublished and actually reduced
rates of genital warts in this country

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:36.930
rates of genital warts in this country
 

01:10:36.930 --> 01:10:39.450
rates of genital warts in this country
in a small trial by about fifty percent

01:10:39.450 --> 01:10:39.460
in a small trial by about fifty percent
 

01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:42.240
in a small trial by about fifty percent
and I just wondered you know it would be

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:42.250
and I just wondered you know it would be
 

01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:43.920
and I just wondered you know it would be
great if there was some scientific

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:43.930
great if there was some scientific
 

01:10:43.930 --> 01:10:45.479
great if there was some scientific
attention to this because we do know

01:10:45.479 --> 01:10:45.489
attention to this because we do know
 

01:10:45.489 --> 01:10:47.370
attention to this because we do know
that behavior change works historically

01:10:47.370 --> 01:10:47.380
that behavior change works historically
 

01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:49.890
that behavior change works historically
it's saved millions of lives in this

01:10:49.890 --> 01:10:49.900
it's saved millions of lives in this
 

01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:52.530
it's saved millions of lives in this

01:10:55.989 --> 01:10:58.920
Africa and in Thailand and elsewhere in
the past and and it needs more

the past and and it needs more
 

01:10:58.930 --> 01:11:01.680
the past and and it needs more
scientific attention and I hope that NIH

01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:01.690
scientific attention and I hope that NIH
 

01:11:01.690 --> 01:11:04.740
scientific attention and I hope that NIH

everything you've kind of laid out a

01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:42.640
perspective woody what is the plan so
 

01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:45.690
perspective woody what is the plan so
what my question is it makes sense for

01:11:45.690 --> 01:11:45.700
what my question is it makes sense for

kind of an accepted playbook of what's

01:11:58.140 --> 01:11:58.150
kind of an accepted playbook of what's
 

01:11:58.150 --> 01:12:00.390
kind of an accepted playbook of what's
going to be so we don't have to make all

01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:00.400
going to be so we don't have to make all
 

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:02.430
going to be so we don't have to make all
the mistakes that we've done in the past

01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:02.440
the mistakes that we've done in the past
 

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:03.930
the mistakes that we've done in the past
and in the absence of not understanding

and in the absence of not understanding
 

01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:05.640

of disease or something that's newly
 

01:12:05.650 --> 01:12:10.760
of disease or something that's newly
emerging yeah the playbook is really a

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:10.770
emerging yeah the playbook is really a
 

01:12:10.770 --> 01:12:14.130
emerging yeah the playbook is really a
sign if you look at the science that has

you know you've clearly shown that

wondering if you can speak to the

history of that we now know that works
 

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:02.990

but we didn't know that in 2001 we

that treatment as prevention worked and

so lessons learned for others I think
the biggest lesson and I don't mean to

01:24:19.319 --> 01:24:19.329
the biggest lesson and I don't mean to
 

01:24:19.329 --> 01:24:22.680
the biggest lesson and I don't mean to
be simplistic about it the lesson is

01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:22.690

every other virus combined total that's
 

01:24:49.719 --> 01:24:52.109
