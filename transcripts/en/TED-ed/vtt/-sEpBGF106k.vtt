00:00:06.946 --> 00:00:08.464
One fine day,

00:00:08.464 --> 00:00:11.997
when Charles Darwin was still 
a student at Cambridge,

00:00:11.997 --> 00:00:16.118
the budding naturalist tore some
old bark off a tree

00:00:16.118 --> 00:00:19.403
and found two rare beetles underneath.

00:00:19.403 --> 00:00:24.034
He’d just taken one beetle in each hand
when he spotted a third beetle.

00:00:24.034 --> 00:00:27.917
Stashing one of the insects 
in his mouth for safekeeping,

00:00:27.917 --> 00:00:30.058
he reached for the new specimen –

00:00:30.058 --> 00:00:34.866
when a sudden spray of hot, 
bitter fluid scalded his tongue.

00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:38.013
Darwin’s assailant 
was the bombardier beetle.

00:00:38.013 --> 00:00:40.355
It’s one of thousands of animal species,

00:00:40.355 --> 00:00:41.210
like frogs,

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.217
jellyfish,

00:00:42.217 --> 00:00:43.075
salamanders,

00:00:43.075 --> 00:00:44.118
and snakes,

00:00:44.118 --> 00:00:47.150
that use toxic chemicals 
to defend themselves –

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.465
in this case, by spewing poisonous liquid 
from glands in its abdomen.

00:00:52.465 --> 00:00:57.921
But why doesn’t this caustic substance,
ejected at 100 degrees Celsius,

00:00:57.921 --> 00:01:00.364
hurt the beetle itself?

00:01:00.364 --> 00:01:05.524
In fact, how do any toxic animals 
survive their own secretions?

00:01:05.524 --> 00:01:09.123
The answer is that they use one 
of two basic strategies:

00:01:09.123 --> 00:01:11.412
securely storing these compounds

00:01:11.412 --> 00:01:14.572
or evolving resistance to them.

00:01:14.572 --> 00:01:17.417
Bombardier beetles use the first approach.

00:01:17.417 --> 00:01:21.154
They store ingredients for their poison 
in two separate chambers.

00:01:21.154 --> 00:01:24.736
When they’re threatened, the valve 
between the chambers opens

00:01:24.736 --> 00:01:28.250
and the substances combine 
in a violent chemical reaction

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.922
that sends a corrosive spray 
shooting out of the glands,

00:01:31.922 --> 00:01:36.212
passing through a hardened chamber that
protects the beetle’s internal tissues.

00:01:36.212 --> 00:01:39.956
Similarly, jellyfish package 
their venom safely

00:01:39.956 --> 00:01:43.249
in harpoon-like structures 
called nematocysts.

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:48.159
And venomous snakes store their
flesh-eating, blood-clotting compounds

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.885
in specialized compartments
that only have one exit:

00:01:51.885 --> 00:01:55.644
through the fangs 
and into their prey or predator.

00:01:55.644 --> 00:02:01.782
Snakes also employ the second strategy:
built-in biochemical resistance.

00:02:01.782 --> 00:02:06.846
Rattlesnakes and other types of vipers
manufacture special proteins

00:02:06.846 --> 00:02:11.864
that bind and inactivate venom 
components in the blood.

00:02:11.864 --> 00:02:17.383
Meanwhile, poison dart frogs have also
evolved resistance to their own toxins,

00:02:17.383 --> 00:02:19.221
but through a different mechanism.

00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:24.214
These tiny animals defend themselves 
using hundreds of bitter-tasting compounds

00:02:24.214 --> 00:02:25.879
called alkaloids

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:32.032
that they accumulate from consuming 
small arthropods like mites and ants.

00:02:32.032 --> 00:02:35.714
One of their most potent alkaloids 
is the chemical epibatidine,

00:02:35.714 --> 00:02:39.834
which binds to the same receptors 
in the brain as nicotine

00:02:39.834 --> 00:02:42.340
but is at least ten times stronger.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.505
An amount barely heavier than 
a grain of sugar would kill you.

00:02:47.505 --> 00:02:51.071
So what prevents poison frogs 
from poisoning themselves?

00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:55.094
Think of the molecular target 
of a neurotoxic alkaloid as a lock,

00:02:55.094 --> 00:02:57.826
and the alkaloid itself as the key.

00:02:57.826 --> 00:03:00.118
When the toxic key slides into the lock,

00:03:00.118 --> 00:03:04.113
it sets off a cascade of chemical 
and electrical signals

00:03:04.113 --> 00:03:05.872
that can cause paralysis,

00:03:05.872 --> 00:03:07.202
unconsciousness,

00:03:07.202 --> 00:03:08.939
and eventually death.

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:12.341
But if you change the shape of the lock,
the key can’t fit.

00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:17.217
For poison dart frogs and many other
animals with neurotoxic defenses,

00:03:17.217 --> 00:03:21.895
a few genetic changes alter
the structure of the alkaloid-binding site

00:03:21.895 --> 00:03:26.972
just enough to keep the neurotoxin 
from exerting its adverse effects.

00:03:26.972 --> 00:03:28.888
Poisonous and venomous animals

00:03:28.888 --> 00:03:31.833
aren’t the only ones that can develop 
this resistance:

00:03:31.833 --> 00:03:34.155
their predators and prey can, too.

00:03:34.155 --> 00:03:37.968
The garter snake, which dines 
on neurotoxic salamanders,

00:03:37.968 --> 00:03:40.946
has evolved resistance 
to salamander toxins

00:03:40.946 --> 00:03:45.351
through some of the same genetic changes 
as the salamanders themselves.

00:03:45.351 --> 00:03:49.728
That means that only the most toxic 
salamanders can avoid being eaten—

00:03:49.728 --> 00:03:53.669
and only the most resistant snakes
will survive the meal.

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:58.146
The result is that the genes providing 
the highest resistance and toxicity

00:03:58.146 --> 00:04:02.506
will be passed on in greatest quantities 
to the next generations.

00:04:02.506 --> 00:04:05.831
As toxicity ramps up, resistance does too,

00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:10.875
in an evolutionary arms race 
that plays out over millions of years.

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:14.171
This pattern appears over and over again.

00:04:14.171 --> 00:04:18.516
Grasshopper mice resist painful 
venom from scorpion prey

00:04:18.516 --> 00:04:21.295
through genetic changes 
in their nervous systems.

00:04:21.295 --> 00:04:24.629
Horned lizards readily 
consume harvester ants,

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:29.253
resisting their envenomed sting 
with specialized blood plasma.

00:04:29.253 --> 00:04:32.530
And sea slugs eat jellyfish nematocysts,

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.911
prevent their activation 
with compounds in their mucus,

00:04:35.911 --> 00:04:39.063
and repurpose them for their own defenses.

00:04:39.063 --> 00:04:42.186
The bombardier beetle is no exception:

00:04:42.186 --> 00:04:43.784
the toads that swallow them

00:04:43.784 --> 00:04:48.010
can tolerate the caustic spray 
that Darwin found so distasteful.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.880
Most of the beetles 
are spit up hours later,

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.254
amazingly alive and well.

00:04:53.254 --> 00:04:56.147
But how do the toads 
survive the experience?

00:04:56.147 --> 00:04:58.556
That is still a mystery.
