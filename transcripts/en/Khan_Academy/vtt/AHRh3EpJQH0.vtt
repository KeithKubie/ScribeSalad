00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.470
SAL KHAN: I'm here with our
exercise guru, Ben Eater--

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:04.330
BEN EATER: Hi, Sal.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:05.960
SAL KHAN: --who made this
exercise, and now we're

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.293
going to try to work through it.

00:00:07.293 --> 00:00:07.950
So let's see.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.460
It says what are
the factors of 9?

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.615
You can re-size this box
with 9 dots-- the box

00:00:13.615 --> 00:00:15.819
has 9 dots-- to help
you find the factors.

00:00:15.819 --> 00:00:17.360
BEN EATER: So what
you're looking at,

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.540
is you've got these
9 dots on the screen.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.970
And right now, there are
just 1 row of 9 dots.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.430
And if you grab
that little thing

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.390
on the right side of the box and
move that around to the left--

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.120
SAL KHAN: Oh, that's neat.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.578
BEN EATER: --you
still have 9 dots,

00:00:29.578 --> 00:00:31.040
but they're arranged
differently.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.550
SAL KHAN: I see.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.350
BEN EATER: And so what you
can see is, try to get them

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.050
so you have the same
number in each row.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.830
SAL KHAN: I see, so this one.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.660
So if you have-- let's
see, not the same number.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.660
BEN EATER: There you go.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:41.576
SAL KHAN: Oh, 3 there.

00:00:41.576 --> 00:00:43.880
And so you could get
to 9 by literally

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.441
multiplying 3 rows
times 3 columns.

00:00:47.441 --> 00:00:48.440
BEN EATER: That's right.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.565
SAL KHAN: And you get to 9.

00:00:49.565 --> 00:00:51.200
BEN EATER: So 3 is a factor.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.620
SAL KHAN: And then we would
write that in this box right

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.530
over here.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.238
BEN EATER: Mm-hm.

00:00:54.238 --> 00:00:57.280
SAL KHAN: So we'd write 3--
do we have to write 3 twice,

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.690
because we have-- or is
just writing 3 once--

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:00.240
BEN EATER: 3 is the factor--

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.360
SAL KHAN: 3 is a factor.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.430
BEN EATER: --so you
just put it once.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.090
SAL KHAN: We don't
have to write it.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.390
If we wrote it twice
would it be wrong?

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.019
BEN EATER: Uh-huh,
yes, actually.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:05.430
SAL KHAN: It would?

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.870
OK, so--

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:06.990
BEN EATER: We do
mark that wrong.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.000
SAL KHAN: --you actually
do mark that wrong.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.220
OK, so there's 3 and 3.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.720
But there was also, right when
you started, you had 9 and 1.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.920
BEN EATER: That's right.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.690
Both of those are factors.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:14.650
SAL KHAN: And I
don't have to write

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:15.910
these in any special order?

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:16.660
BEN EATER: No, no.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:17.400
SAL KHAN: 1 and 9.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.899
BEN EATER: Just got
to get them all.

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:21.200
SAL KHAN: And I believe
that's all there is.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.700
And we could look
at the other ones,

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.817
and we can see, look
2 and 8 definitely--

00:01:25.817 --> 00:01:26.400
BEN EATER: No.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.170
SAL KHAN: No, that's
not working out.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.670
It's interesting
for people to think

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.900
about why these
aren't working out.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.608
BEN EATER: Right.

00:01:31.608 --> 00:01:33.340
Yeah, you can't divide 2 into 9.

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:38.300
SAL KHAN: And this just
gets us to 1 and 9 again,

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.510
and we don't want to repeat it.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.180
BEN EATER: Those are
the same factors.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.640
SAL KHAN: Exactly.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.690
So let's check our answer.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.360
Let's see how we're doing.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.230
BEN EATER: OK.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.230
SAL KHAN: Let's see.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.907
There we go.

00:01:44.907 --> 00:01:45.740
We got it all right.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.577
Let's do one more.

00:01:46.577 --> 00:01:47.160
BEN EATER: OK.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.410
SAL KHAN: Let's do one more.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.910
Correct.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:49.660
The next question.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.900
You can resize this
box with 16 dots

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.650
to help you find the factor.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.690
It's 1 and 16.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:57.710
BEN EATER: 1 and 16
are factors, sure.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:58.600
SAL KHAN: So me write those.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.840
BEN EATER: Those
are all its factors.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.630
SAL KHAN: So 1 and 16.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.030
So let's play with
this box here.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.820
That's not working.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.340
That's not working.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.500
So I'm trying to figure
out-- so this is essentially

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.470
going 2 times-- 2 might be
a factor if I could just--

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.120
oh look, it is.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.860
BEN EATER: There it is, yeah.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.600
2 is a factor

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.600
SAL KHAN: 2 is a factor.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.810
BEN EATER: And so is 8.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:19.935
SAL KHAN: Exactly, exactly.

00:02:19.935 --> 00:02:21.200
2 rows of 8 works.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.959
And so we could say
2 and 8 are factors.

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.500
BEN EATER: And if
you think about it,

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.975
2 and 8 both divide into 16.

00:02:27.975 --> 00:02:28.850
SAL KHAN: Absolutely.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:29.840
BEN EATER: 2
divides eight times.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.130
SAL KHAN: Yes.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.360
BEN EATER: Or 8
divides two times.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.690
SAL KHAN: Yes, you can that.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:32.440
You can construct.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.148
BEN EATER: Right.

00:02:33.148 --> 00:02:35.800
SAL KHAN: 16 dots, you can
divide them into 2 groups of 8.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.010
BEN EATER: That's right.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.620
SAL KHAN: And I suspect
also 8 groups of 2.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.700
BEN EATER: Well,
you can see that.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.325
SAL KHAN: Let's see,
so that's 2 groups

00:02:40.325 --> 00:02:41.950
of 8, really, or 2 rows of 8.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.550
Let's see, or oh, look at that.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.380
4 times 4.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.770
BEN EATER: 4 times 4.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:46.800
SAL KHAN: And I'll
just write the 4 once.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.966
BEN EATER: So 4 is a factor.

00:02:47.966 --> 00:02:49.160
SAL KHAN: 4 is a factor.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.500
And then I can-- and I've
probably-- well, I've

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.620
already gotten 8 and 2.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.700
BEN EATER: Already got that.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.780
SAL KHAN: Now I have 8 groups
of 2 instead of 2 groups of 8,

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.071
but they're still both factors.

00:02:58.071 --> 00:02:59.970
Then you go back to 16 and 1.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:00.230
BEN EATER: That's right.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.120
SAL KHAN: So I think we're done.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.640
BEN EATER: I think so.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.630
SAL KHAN: Let's
check our answer.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.890
Oh--

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:03.210
BEN EATER: Very good.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:04.040
SAL KHAN: --very
good, very good.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.950
Well, thank you.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.070
That was fun.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.340
BEN EATER: Thank you.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.740
SAL KHAN: This was very
neat, very fun to play with.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.290
BEN EATER: Well, thanks.
