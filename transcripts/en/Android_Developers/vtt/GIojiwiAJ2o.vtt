IGNACIO MONEREO:
So hi, everyone.

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.530
I'm Ignacio, or Nacho.

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.950
I am based in London, and I
work with many game developers

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.720
across the Western
Europe region.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.470
So many of you-- in fact, I
see a lot of familiar faces.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.673
So thanks for coming
after the break.

00:00:13.673 --> 00:00:14.590
Thanks for being here.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.920
And today, we're going to
talk about old games, which

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.050
in some cases, in
some instances,

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.120
might be your first success.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.100
And we are going to
understand whether these,

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.190
they age better or worse.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.010
And the goal of this
session is basically--

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.220
whoa, that was a
strong introduction.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.810
So the goal of this
session is essentially

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.130
to understand, what are
the different strategies?

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.480
So if these games are becoming
a burden or a technology debt

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.030
or if these are actually
the new opportunity

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.410
that you can actually follow.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.410
And to do that, I will have on
stage two fantastic speakers,

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.860
so Erik, CEO of
Dodreams, and, as well,

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.470
Anette, VP of Business and
Marketing from Dirtybit.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.800
So I wanted to start
with a very easy example.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.230
Because when we're thinking
about old games, then

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.900
I thought, all right,
let's look at old games

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.950
and how they look like today.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.460
So we have two games
here, both of them

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.820
by the Russian
developer Game Insight.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.570
I don't know if you're
familiar with them,

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.530
but "Tribez" was published
six years ago in 2012.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.760
And we have, as well, "Transport
Empire," published in 2014

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.930
four years ago.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.330
And there is a big difference
among these developers.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.860
I don't know if
maybe you can guess.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.690
If you are obviously working for
Game Insights, you would know.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.230
OK, so I'm just going to--

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.180
so essentially, what
happens with these games

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.300
is that one of these games
is actually a priority today.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.510
Still it represents a
big part of the revenues.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.050
So when I was
looking at old games,

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.080
we basically identified that
some of these old games, they

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.880
became an evergreen title.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.210
And even though it's been a long
time since they were published,

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.730
they still represent a
very important source

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.320
of revenues for the developer.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.920
And as well, this translates
into having these resources

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.850
into the game.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.910
And "Transport Empire" would
be part of that back catalog.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.820
So the first thing to
consider is this one.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.020
If we look at another
two examples here,

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.009
both of them, in this
case, are top priorities

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.040
for both developers.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.670
However, if we look
at the right side,

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.450
we might think that this
game is-- it looks classier

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.640
or at least slightly older.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.630
And in fact, "RuneScape
Old School" by Jagex

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.180
was published in PC for the
first time 17 years ago,

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.160
so it makes sense.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.190
While "Respawnables,"
Digital Legends,

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.620
was published five
years ago only.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.470
However, if you are a fan
of "RuneScape Old School,"

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.590
you would know that the game
hasn't been launched yet

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.110
in mobile.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.830
It's in fact, launching in two
weeks, the 2nd of November.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.450
So when we are talking
about, why is a game old,

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.100
or how is an old game--

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.450
how do we define these?

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.430
Is it by the launch
date, by when

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.130
the game was released in PC,
in the case of "RuneScape?"

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.640
Or maybe it's just one year,
five years, or two years.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.000
So this is two things that
we need to have in mind,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.910
and then we were trying to
figure out how these games are

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.100
performing nowadays in Play.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.140
And we had to take
two assumptions, which

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.940
are very big assumptions.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.943
And the first case was when
the game was published.

00:03:13.943 --> 00:03:15.860
And so we are going to
look at games that were

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.320
published four years or older.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.990
And then also if this game
represents a top priority

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.920
for the company--

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.200
if the game is driving
most of the revenues,

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.580
then in this case, we
will consider an outlier.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.420
So we're making the
assumption of less than 50%

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.980
of the overall portfolio
of the developer.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.680
So if we look at these and
we take these into account,

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.510
and we look at the top games
by revenue and downloads

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.380
in the Play Store, we will see
that, in fact, old games are

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.320
very much alive and kicking.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.140
And what it means is that--

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.140
so first of all, old games--

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.520
these games with these four
years old and, as well,

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.570
less than 50%--

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.660
they represent 17%
of those top revenue

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.390
games in the Play Store.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.490
And as well, they receive
new users every day.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.470
17.5% of the downloads
in the past six months

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.960
were going to these titles.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.000
From an engagement perspective,
it's something similar.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.430
We see that these
old games-- they

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.760
seem to have very engaged
communities and fans that they

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.050
keep playing and, on average,
59% of daily active users

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:21.692
more than the newer games.

00:04:21.692 --> 00:04:23.650
On the other hand, the
design of the games-- it

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.160
seems to be shorter
[? terms, ?] so shorter times.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.600
And we see that,
on average, they

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.550
spend less time per daily
active users, so 29% less.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.590
Also, we take into
account monetization,

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:36.490
within-app purchases.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.980
In particular, we will
see that old games,

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.600
they tend to monetize
slightly less better.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.500
And we see minus 18% in ARPDAU.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.190
And last but not least, as
everything old in this life,

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.720
it tends to have some issues.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.340
We see that, also, from
a vitals perspective,

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:58.720
they have, on average, 50% more
crash rates and 20% more ANRs.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.430
So in a nutshell, these games,
these four-year-old games,

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.730
they have a lot of
new fresh installs,

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.380
new users coming every day.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.990
They still make a lot
of significant revenue,

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.000
although might be
slightly lower.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.350
And they have some issues
in terms of, for example,

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.680
vitals and crash rates and ANRs.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.810
Now, the question here
is, is this a burden?

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.360
Do we consider these
games as technology debt,

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.870
or do we consider
it an opportunity?

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.560
And so there's two
very clear ways,

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.320
but there is three routes.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.810
So there's three common ways
that developers are following.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.120
So if you go to the very much
I consider this as a burden,

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.735
the ultimate case is
to unpublish the game.

00:05:42.735 --> 00:05:44.110
And this is the
case that we will

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.880
hear from Dirtybit later on.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.560
If you go on the
other hand, I consider

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.460
this as my biggest
opportunity, then why not

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.980
I put more resources into
this game and try to revamp it

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.290
and become again one of
my top drivers of revenue?

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.610
And this is the case
from Dodreams later on.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.180
And when we ask developers, we
found out that majority of you,

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.360
that you go into what we
call the back catalog mode

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.980
or long tail or status quo.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.330
And so we ask, how do
games end up in this mode?

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.690
So there's a couple
of common factors.

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.320
So many times, we see that
LiveOps, new content updates--

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.000
they don't have the same effect.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.090
As well, the ROI campaigns,
they try to stabilize.

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.670
LTV is very similar to CPIs.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.500
Other factors could
be also affecting,

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.500
for example, cannibalization
between your own games.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.140
You launch a new game,
and you see a lot of users

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.470
from the previous one
go into this title

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.060
and, as well, external
factors, such as competitors

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.290
or new genres that
are appearing.

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:44.860
And does this mean
that the game is dead?

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.200
Well actually, no,
and that's for sure.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.840
We still have very
engaged communities.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.900
And as Game Insights
was sharing with us,

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.330
brand perception is very
important, and keeping alive

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.640
this game is critical for them.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.687
But also, generally,
they're very profitable.

00:07:00.687 --> 00:07:02.770
So if we look at the games
[? instance ?] as well,

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.140
we see that old games,
or long-tail games,

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.810
generate 14% of
the total revenues.

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.810
And on average, they
have 50% more profits

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:13.190
than the newer ones.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.670
So what are the key challenges?

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:17.170
So I put three key challenges.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.260
There might be more.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.160
But the main ones would be
first is spaghetti code.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.790
So some problems with
the-- as the case

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:26.560
we've seen that they have some
issues with technical problems

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.480
like ANRs and crash rates.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.120
Also as well, monetization
is hard to keep up

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.340
with the [? CPNs ?] updating
the mediation platforms as well.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.370
Sometimes you might
see that your game

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:38.440
is using agencies that
they do not [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.210
or networks that
they are not anymore.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:41.860
And last, team.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.450
Every developer
is looking forward

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:46.480
to work in the next title,
in the next big hit.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.960
And convincing then, motivating
the users or the developers

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.400
to actually work in these
games might be hard.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:58.680
So just to finalize this,
some very few recommendations

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:03.960
from another developer here
today with us, Oh BiBi.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.780
So we have-- to tackle
these precise challenges,

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.960
we can think about the ways
to optimize a target SDK,

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.780
how we can keep updating
the game or the versions

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:16.860
of the engine in a efficient
way, maybe outsourcing.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.750
Another way, also,
of thinking is,

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:21.240
how do we keep an
efficient monetization

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.300
by updating automatically
the CPMs or by,

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.880
for example, automatizing
the customer support

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.580
whenever the players are
using in-app purchases?

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:34.350
Another very interesting
example, automatizing LiveOps.

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:38.220
So for example, the Halloween
sales or the Halloween LiveOps

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.780
that you are running
this year might

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.730
be the same as the last year.

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:43.530
But users, they might not know.

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:46.140
The players might not know
that this is exactly the same,

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.600
and that keeps the
game fresh and alive.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.510
And last but not least, we've
seen today a number of examples

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:55.890
of how can you improve your
conversion via store listings,

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.610
for example, country targeting.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:58.590
We have it now.

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:01.500
And this will help you to
drive and continue driving

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.270
those users to your game.

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.580
And with this, I would
like to invite to the stage

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.830
Anette Staloy, who
is going to talk

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:11.040
about a different way,
which is, in this case,

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.454
to actually go unpublishing.

00:09:12.454 --> 00:09:13.496
ANETTE STALOY: Thank you.

00:09:13.496 --> 00:09:14.975
IGNACIO MONEREO: You're welcome.

00:09:14.975 --> 00:09:18.426
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:20.583 --> 00:09:21.750
ANETTE STALOY: Hi, everyone.

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.250
Thank you for coming.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.030
It's my first time
at the Playtime event

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:29.210
and my first time
in Berlin, actually.

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:32.390
So I joined the games industry
in the Norwegian studio

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:34.495
called Dirtybit three years ago.

00:09:34.495 --> 00:09:35.870
And I work in the
management team

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.490
together with the founders.

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:39.350
So working for a
small company means

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:41.480
that I work with both
management, business

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.460
development, marketing, ad ops.

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:48.870
Dirtybit was founded
in 2011, and I've

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:50.790
been part of the
company since we were

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:54.630
8 and to a team of 18 today.

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:57.900
We're based in Bergen on
the west coast of Norway.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.390
Anyone who has been
in Bergen here?

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.630
Oh, quite a few, cool.

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.700
So we're owned by the founders.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:10.080
And us employees, we make and
publish free-to-play games,

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.260
and we monetize on
in-app purchase and ads.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.050
Two of the founders grew
up together in Bergen,

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:19.060
and they had many fond
memories of beating

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.800
each other in "Mario Kart."

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.308
So when they started
making games,

00:10:22.308 --> 00:10:24.100
they could find a lot
of multiplayer games,

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.780
but they were all turn-based.

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:28.890
So they took on the challenge of
making a real-time multiplayer

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:29.390
game.

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:33.940
And remember, this was in
2011, so this was quite unique

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:34.660
at the time.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:35.650
This is how it looked.

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:39.200
Have anyone played it?

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.130
Nice.

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:43.040
So the game started spreading
in schools in the US,

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.790
and it went viral
in social media.

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:49.760
It trended on Twitter, and
it reached the top charts

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.330
overall in the US and many
other countries-- not bad

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.880
for a very small,
young team from Norway.

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.460
So in April this year,
we had three games live,

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:03.100
all in the "Fun Run" series.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.670
As you can see,
"Fun Run" that was

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:09.440
launched in 2012,
the next one in 2014.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.050
So even if we had
all these games live,

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:13.820
all games were still
getting downloads

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.440
and had significant user bases.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.110
But most of our
efforts were into what

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:23.020
I call the new game, which
was launched in 2016.

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:26.230
So what we saw was that even if
it brings most of our revenue,

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:29.620
it only gets about
half of our downloads.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:32.690
So fast-forwarding a few months,
this is how it looks today.

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:35.200
So now we can see that
the new game, newest game,

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.230
has more than 99%
of our downloads

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:41.632
and is also bringing
in most of the revenue.

00:11:41.632 --> 00:11:42.340
So what happened?

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.770
Last year, our current
strategy, as it

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:54.190
had been for several years,
was to grow the user base.

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.180
And we actually reached
100 million downloads,

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:59.700
all organic, no paid UA.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:03.240
That's pretty cool, right?

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.850
So as our network in the
industry grew and many of you

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:09.690
started sharing numbers with
us and we got a little help

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:11.790
from app [INAUDIBLE]
premium, we realized

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:17.550
that we had a lot to improve
when it comes to monetization.

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.520
We hired a full-time
analyst, and that

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:23.570
helped us transitioning from
basing most of our decisions

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:27.110
on gut feeling to really
diving into the numbers.

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:29.960
We started doing some UA,
and it became more clear

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.850
that we need a new strategy
to increase our revenue.

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:35.910
So that's what we've
been doing this year is

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:38.670
focusing on the numbers,
analyzing everything.

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:44.170
And our analyst introduced this
term of MMM, Making More Money.

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:48.380
Maybe you do that
the same as well.

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:51.030
We have been very
careful, scared

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:53.590
of harming the user experience.

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:57.300
So we have been trying to
enhance our monetization,

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:59.550
and it's been well-received.

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:00.990
And everybody's happy.

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:03.760
The analyst is happy,
and we're happy.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.370
We've been working
more focused with ASO,

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:08.280
and I brought this example here.

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:11.370
When we first launched
"Fun Run 3 Arena,"

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:12.930
we didn't even call
it "Fun Run 3."

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:15.420
We called it "Fun Run Arena"
because our gut feeling said

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.350
that that was the
right thing to do.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:20.580
So this was the icon,
also based on gut feeling.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.830
A year after launch,
we did an experiment

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:26.440
in Google Play just
adding the number 3.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.070
And as you can see the
results, it became clear to us

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:34.580
that we should update both
the title and the icon.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:37.190
So "Fun Run 3" was
clearly our star.

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:42.340
But what's the challenge?

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.360
The monetization,
when we compared it

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:48.470
to the older titles, two to
four times better ARPDAU.

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:50.890
Retention was
clearly a lot better.

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:53.240
Technology-- we
built the newest game

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:57.690
in Unity, which made it
easier for us to maintain.

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:00.480
This is the game where
we had the dedicated team

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.510
and want to deliver the
best gameplay and best user

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:05.120
experience.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.353
And I know that
Nacho and [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:07.353 --> 00:14:09.020
if you have seen their
talks before, you

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:10.603
might have heard
them talking about we

00:14:10.603 --> 00:14:12.650
live in a post-launch world.

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:14.720
And we agree, and we
plan to do LiveOps

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.610
for this game to
improve it, make

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:19.550
it even better for a long time.

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:22.150
So the challenges, as
can see from some numbers

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:26.080
from AppAnnie showing our
most important keyword.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.292
The users searching for our
game found the old titles,

00:14:29.292 --> 00:14:31.750
and they were a bit confused
it seemed to what to download.

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:36.520
We even got a big
featuring for "Fun Run 2,"

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.030
and thank you very much.

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:44.220
We appreciate that, but it
didn't help us grow "Fun Run 3"

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.987
We tried to un-optimize.

00:14:45.987 --> 00:14:47.320
I don't know if you've tried it.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:50.310
It can be pretty tricky when
you have millions of downloads

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:53.740
with a lot of historical data.

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:59.050
When we launched "Fun Run 1"
and 2, we had organic growth.

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:01.150
The games went viral,
hit the top charts.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:03.100
We couldn't do that the same.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.470
And we were competing not
only with all the games

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:09.290
in the market but
also ourselves.

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:13.000
So here, you can
see what happened

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.060
when we started testing
removing "Fun Run 1" from Turkey

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:18.760
where we had a
significant user base.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:23.060
People started downloading
"Fun Run 2," not "Fun Run 3."

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:25.870
So when we removed "Fun
Run 2" from the market,

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:30.160
finally people were starting to
download "Fun Run 3" as well.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.370
And it started to grow.

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:37.890
So we decided to unpublish,
like Nacho talked about.

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:41.100
We saw from the test that
we expected the new game

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:44.260
to absorb 90% of the downloads.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.440
"Fun Run 3" was the game we
wanted our users to download.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.400
The monetization was better.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.430
We wanted to be open
with our community

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:53.040
and inform them
that we were going

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.940
to focus on "Fun Run
3" going forward,

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.365
and we expected a backlash.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.880
We were right.

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.890
"Fun Run 3" absorbed
most of the downloads,

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:06.460
and it's been growing since.

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:09.670
So we increased our user
base in "Fun Run 3."

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:11.890
Overall, we lost
users, but that was

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:16.570
because we removed older games.

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:18.730
We managed to
increase our revenue.

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:21.190
This is from April to August.

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:22.600
And August and
September has been

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.760
looking pretty nice as well.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.710
We have been able
to free up resources

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:30.830
to do the great LiveOps we
want to do for "Fun Run 3."

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:34.010
So our key learnings is
we tested in a market

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:36.300
where we had a
significant user base.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:40.520
We knew what
numbers to look for,

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:43.350
and we made decisions
based on the key metrics.

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:45.930
And we were prepared to
let the first game go

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:49.860
even if there is a lot of
nostalgia there as well.

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:53.020
We planned for the best and
the worst-case scenario,

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:57.570
and we had a plan B.
Do not underestimate

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:00.040
the impact on your community.

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:03.210
And I brought this example
today because we still

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:06.270
have a very active
"Fun Run 2" community.

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:10.349
They even made a petition to
make us bring the game back.

00:17:10.349 --> 00:17:13.079
Every time we post
something in social media,

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:18.329
like I did today from
here, first reply

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:20.505
is, please remember "Fun Run 2."

00:17:20.505 --> 00:17:24.690
And they made a very
touching video with music.

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:27.130
So this happens every time.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:29.340
So even though
some of our players

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.830
rated "Fun Run 3" with
one star because they

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:34.680
want us to bring them back, we
have a very active community

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:38.010
playing "Fun Run 3,"
creating content, and helping

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:39.640
us grow organically.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:43.140
So for us, the right
decision was to divest.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:47.100
So I have the honor of
inviting my good friend, Erik,

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:50.320
to the stage to talk
about their approach,

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.630
which was a bit different.

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:52.130
Thank you.

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:54.044
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:54.044 --> 00:17:55.294
ERIK PONTISKOSKI: [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:55.294 --> 00:17:56.502
ANETTE STALOY: There you are.

00:17:56.502 --> 00:17:58.480
ERIK PONTISKOSKI:
Thank you very much.

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.820
Hello, everyone.

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:05.550
My name is Erik, and
I'm the CEO at Dodreams.

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:09.000
It's really exciting to be
here in Berlin at Playtime

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.480
and honor to share the stage
with my dear friends, Nacho

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.000
and Anette.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.950
I will present today or talk
about our portfolio strategy.

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:23.670
I will present what
kind of choices we made,

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:27.720
explain what was the logic
behind those choices,

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:32.175
and then present what kind of
impact it had on our business.

00:18:34.925 --> 00:18:39.640
At Dodreams, we make games
where players do stuff

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.300
that dreams are made of.

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.580
So we are Dodreams.

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:47.800
And we are the makers of
this "Drive Ahead!" portfolio

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.270
of games.

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:53.000
This key art is for
our game "Drive Ahead!"

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.750
"Drive Ahead!" is a
gladiator car fight game.

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:57.400
what that means
is you get points

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:01.190
by hitting your friend
in the head with a car.

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:03.730
And thank you for that
reaction because that's

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:08.050
what 100 million people
all around the world

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:11.500
think also when they decided
to download the game.

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:14.750
So it's a really fun
and simple premise.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:17.080
And in our vision,
"Drive Ahead!" games

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:23.270
are the best way to play, share,
and watch fun gaming content.

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:26.620
So we have a very large
and active community built

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:28.330
around video for the game.

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:30.370
And thanks to this
community, we're

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:37.310
getting 100,000 new
downloads every single day.

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:41.200
And this is what the game
originally looked like.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:46.100
So it was developed for a sauna
party by one of our employees.

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.260
So he was having some
beers with his friends,

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:51.007
and they came up
with this idea that,

00:19:51.007 --> 00:19:52.840
hey, what would it look
like if a tank would

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:55.210
be battling a lorry truck?

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:57.620
And let's put a
garbage truck there

00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:00.770
against a go-kart or
something like that.

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:03.490
So even today, the game
looks pretty much the same.

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:05.290
In the core gameplay,
of course, we've

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:09.400
brought a lot of
other stuff to it.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.700
So the first game
went live in 2015.

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:16.480
And then in 2016, we decided
that, let's have a portfolio

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.740
strategy.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:21.640
Business logic there is that
we'll do cross promotion,

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:24.400
we're going to get the higher
number of daily active users,

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.860
and then we're going
to make more money.

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:31.450
And then also, we had
realized that when

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:34.990
we made the first game, maybe
we weren't so experienced

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:36.180
or we made some mistakes.

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:38.980
So instead of going
through the trouble

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:42.010
of updating the first game,
let's just fix everything

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:44.680
that we did wrong at one go.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:48.560
And we were quite
experimental with it.

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:52.990
So we decided that instead of
just making the second game,

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:55.070
let's experiment a little bit.

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:56.560
So we had an idea
for "Drive Ahead!

00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:00.760
Sports," so you can play soccer
and other sports with cars.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:04.630
So we made it first an
event in the original game.

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:07.580
And when we told fans
that summer is over,

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:09.730
soccer is going away,
then they started

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:11.782
begging us to bring it back.

00:21:11.782 --> 00:21:13.240
And we said, well,
you can play it.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.540
But it's going to be
a standalone game.

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:21.220
And in 2016, actually it
had significant contribution

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:22.585
to the studio revenue.

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:31.300
In 2017, we realized that
this portfolio approach

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:33.610
isn't working perfectly for us.

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:35.260
So "Drive Ahead!

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:38.230
Sports" turned out to
be even more a skill

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:42.730
game than the
original game, so it's

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:45.190
reaching a more niche audience.

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:50.020
We were able to be better
in the free-to-play design

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:50.630
of the game.

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:54.820
So for example, ARPDAU
was 2.5 times higher.

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:58.060
But that doesn't really help
when you're reaching only 20%

00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:01.060
of the players from
the original title.

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:04.450
And the really ugly
thing we did in 2017

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:06.940
was that we tried
to fix everything

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:09.880
once again at one go.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.580
So we made a major
change where changed

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:16.990
the UI, UX, added a saga
map, and tons of other thing.

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:18.910
And everybody hated it.

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:21.580
So we lost half of the
players and revenue,

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:24.160
and retention was
almost destroyed

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.290
and nearly killed the game.

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:30.310
And then we also
went all in with AR.

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:32.110
So we made a game
called "Drive Ahead!

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:33.250
Minigolf."

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:35.530
So if we have car
gladiators, this

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:37.750
is what they do in
their free time.

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:41.140
And it turned out that we were
there a little bit too early

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:45.160
and were doing fancy motion
controls with the device.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.440
People were playing
minigolf like this,

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.940
and it didn't work out either.

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:55.600
So we discovered that this is
a bit risky as an approach.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:59.130
So the decision was that let's
focus on the original title.

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:03.000
It's getting that 100,000
new players a day.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.420
Good things are that there's
high engagement and virality

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:08.190
through the community.

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:13.140
We realized that
we've only scratched

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:16.810
the surface with
monetization potential there.

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:20.010
So that's a picture of our team
there with our head of studio

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:20.980
talking to them.

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:23.580
And this is the group
that was given the task

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:26.790
to revamp the game.

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:29.520
Our approach was the following.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:32.370
We realized that it's
too much risk changing

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:35.620
things in the game, like
making too big changes.

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:37.860
But we had started
doing LiveOps,

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:41.400
which is a really great place
to change the rules of the game.

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:45.240
And we see what
works there and then

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:48.700
bring it into the actual game.

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.480
And so what happened
next was that we

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.260
started doing these iterations.

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:56.880
So first, we redid the
first-time user experience

00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:01.380
to teach the players how to
watch ads as a daily habit

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:05.340
and show the value of growing
your collection in the game.

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:10.050
And then in the second iteration
was our LiveOps events,

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:13.800
where we gave the
players the feature

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:17.550
that they could
build a deck of cars

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:19.470
that they use in a boss fight.

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:25.670
So both experiments increased
ad engagement rate by 50%,

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:30.250
and ad engagement is
one of our key KPIs.

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:32.200
So the lessons we
learned here was

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.800
that when you launch a
new game in a portfolio,

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:38.140
you have to very
clearly define, what

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:39.990
is the positioning
of that product,

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:43.660
and why should it exist
as a standalone game?

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:46.330
And what has worked
really well for us

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:49.750
is validating new
features, content, even

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:53.050
new games with the community.

00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:55.690
We found that when we
openly say that this

00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:57.460
is the good stuff
of our game and this

00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:59.980
is what we're trying
to fix, it actually

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:02.980
attracts new talent,
then, and ignites

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:04.660
the passion of the team.

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:07.420
So we've had really senior
people join the studio

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:10.660
because they say that the
problems you guys have

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.920
are fun problems to solve.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:17.290
So let's fix monetization
when you have a big community.

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:19.930
And you might wonder what
happened to "Drive Ahead!

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:20.740
Sports."

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:23.230
So we still have it live.

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:26.710
We empowered a fresh,
young, talented team

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:29.110
to take ownership of the game.

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:31.000
And they're doing
a really good job

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.180
and really battling against
the "Drive Ahead!" team.

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:38.590
So that's all for me.

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:41.760
So now I'd like
to invite Nacho--

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:45.900
[STUTTERS] Mr. Money
Oreo back on the stage

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:47.120
to do his conclusions.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.140
IGNACIO MONEREO: Thank
you, Mr. Pontiskoski.

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:50.046
[LAUGHS]

00:25:50.046 --> 00:25:52.770
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:55.432
All right, so to
conclude, I'm going

00:25:55.432 --> 00:25:56.640
to take a couple [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:59.780
So first of all, remind that--
and this is a quote from Erik,

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:03.590
in fact, which is if a player
has downloaded the game and is

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:05.720
a new player, he doesn't know--

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.700
or he or she doesn't
know that the game

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:10.140
was published five years ago.

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:12.500
So this is something really
important to remember,

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:16.070
to keep it fresh and
have that in mind.

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:18.740
And so just to
conclude, so we've

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:21.590
seen that old games still
receive a big number

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:23.550
of downloads nowadays.

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:26.840
So this is incredibly
interesting for you

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:29.150
to think about, like, how
do you explore and to test?

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:31.760
Also that they have
engaged communities

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.750
and then they can
be very profitable.

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:37.040
So what you can do, and I
think some of the insights

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.040
that we've learned--

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:41.240
so first of all, take
decisions based on metrics

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:45.320
and be ready to let the
first success, your baby, go.

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.720
Well, that was the
case of Dirtybit.

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:49.160
As well, consider the community.

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.760
We've seen that the community
always is going to be a problem

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.230
or is going to
react in some way.

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:57.020
So how do you plan
before unpublishing

00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:58.240
if you take that route?

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:00.740
And if you decide
to revamp the game,

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:04.440
I think Erik mentioned
some managerial lessons,

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:08.600
his insights on his experience
with exciting the team,

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:11.750
motivating the developers in
order to really work together

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:13.310
to grow the game again.

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:16.750
And with this,
thank you very much.
