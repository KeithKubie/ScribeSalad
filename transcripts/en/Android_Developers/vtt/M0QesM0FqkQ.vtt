00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:06.770
IAN NI-LEWIS: Hello, everyone.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.490
My name is Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.550
RETO MEIER: And I'm
Reto Meier.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.360
And on today's "App Clinic,"
we'll be looking at apps

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.864
people while they're
traveling.

00:00:14.864 --> 00:00:16.280
IAN NI-LEWIS: [COUGHS]

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.950
That's an excellent idea.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.190
And I just swallowed coffee
down my lungs.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.620
Why don't you take
the next line.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:22.940
RETO MEIER: That is the
wrong place to be

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.010
drinking your coffee.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.180
Gone are the days of badly
folded maps, guidebooks, and

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.210
laminated holiday itineraries.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.860
Today you can keep everything
you need in the

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.300
palm of your hand.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.850
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's right.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.480
No longer will you look like a
bumbling tourist standing on

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.370
the corner of Oxford Street and
Charing Cross Road with

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.000
your London street map
unfolded before you,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.975
fruitlessly trying to figure
out which direction is--

00:00:45.975 --> 00:00:47.600
you know, I never
even do that.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.180
RETO MEIER: No?

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.410
What's your plan?

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.250
IAN NI-LEWIS: My plan is,
I'm always looking

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.190
at the curb in London.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.570
Because it tells me which way
the traffic is flowing.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.510
RETO MEIER: That is very true.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.410
Keeping your eye on the road
is probably wise for an

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.830
American in London if
you don't want to be

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.300
murdered by a black cab.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.800
IAN NI-LEWIS: In any case,
let's face it.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.290
When you're in a foreign city,
foreign country, there's a lot

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.680
to keep in your mind.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.104
And I don't think my mind
is big enough to

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:11.800
encompass it all.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.360
RETO MEIER: Well, you want to
be able to use your mind for

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.030
things like appreciating the
sights and sounds of the new

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.390
city that you're visiting, not
trying to remember exactly

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.750
where you need to be and how
you're going to get there.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.070
IAN NI-LEWIS: And you certainly
do not want to be

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.267
unfolding a paper map because
that's just like a sign that

00:01:25.267 --> 00:01:25.830
says "mug me."

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.090
RETO MEIER: Yeah, please
steal my stuff.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.970
I have stuff.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.010
I probably have three weeks'
worth of money in my pocket.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.985
Please, rob me.

00:01:31.985 --> 00:01:33.780
And that is not the message you
want to be sending out.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.220
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's funny,
because you do get different

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.480
reactions in every city.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.110
For instance, in London, I think
they just try and sell

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.820
you a three-card Monte.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.800
In New York, they kill you.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.025
In Beijing, they want to
take you to tea, and

00:01:46.025 --> 00:01:47.760
then you pay for it.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.680
And in Shanghai, they want to
introduce you to your sister--

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.030
their sister.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.780
RETO MEIER: Well, introducing
them to my sister would be

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.350
interesting.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.840
IAN NI-LEWIS: Eh, that too.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.320
RETO MEIER: Particularly as
I don't have a sister.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.710
Anyway, so today we're going
to be looking at four apps

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.820
that the viewers have nominated
as must-have travel

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.990
assistance apps.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.870
So we're going to be looking
at social venue discovery

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.330
classic Foursquare--

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.949
IAN NI-LEWIS: The ultimate
in travel management--

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:11.910
TripIt.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.550
RETO MEIER: --and one-click
location-sharing widget, Share

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.960
Where location widget.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.320
IAN NI-LEWIS: Excellent.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.470
We'll be taking a closer look
at each of these apps and

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.100
using them as a kicking off
point to explore the

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.820
technologies and the best
practices that you need in

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.550
order to create a must-have
travel app.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.680
RETO MEIER: All that
and more on--

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.520
IAN NI-LEWIS: "The
App Clinic."

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.380
RETO MEIER: So a travel
assistant is a pretty broad

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.530
category, and that's being
reflected in the three apps

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.580
that we'll be looking
at today.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.060
IAN NI-LEWIS: As part of the
Developer Relations team at

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.320
Google, travel is a big part of
our job-- or it used to be

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.830
before we got this boss video
studio, the video studio that

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.140
puts that thing in back of us.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.720
Hey!

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.460
So this is a category that we
are intimately familiar with.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.870
I've been traveling
for work for what?

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.880
10 years now, and it
can be a nightmare.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.800
RETO MEIER: It's also one of
the more popular groups of

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.060
apps in Google Play.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.380
And the popular apps in this
category tend to have very

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.210
loyal and passionate uses.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.100
Take, for example, Foursquare.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.170
So let's have a look.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.450
Boy, look at that.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.090
IAN NI-LEWIS: Beautiful.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.660
Now this isn't a travel app per
se, but it's definitely

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.060
useful as a travel app.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.540
I think you had some insights
into that recently.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.870
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.432
Let's see.

00:03:32.432 --> 00:03:34.330
We want to put that in front.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.350
In fact, yeah.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.910
I remember how this was
supposed to work now.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:39.340
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yes, indeed.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.660
RETO MEIER: Excellent.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.060
So when I was growing up in
Australia, Foursquare was the

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.010
name of an independent group of
supermarkets whose TV ads

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.170
implored me to come in
for a square deal.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.600
So every time I look at this
app, I hear the jingle playing

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.700
in my head.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.150
Leaving that aside, I'm a big
fan of Foursquare, both for

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.240
the service and the features
that they offer as well as

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.880
their passion for creating a
really great user experience,

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.560
which is a really
important thing.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.670
We can see that over the course
of the years, the

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.820
Foursquare app has really
progressed.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.490
As each version of Android
has come out, they've

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:12.510
refreshed the UI.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.610
They've taken advantage of some
of our best practices.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.589
So this is an app that I'm
a really big fan of.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:19.760
Now, strictly speaking, you
don't need to be traveling for

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.000
Foursquare to be useful.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.970
In a lot of ways, it's most
useful when you're close to

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.400
home, doing your
daily routine.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.740
I know a lot of people whose
coffee shop loyalty is based

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.340
around fierce competition to
maintain their status as mayor

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.600
of Pete's Coffee Shop on the
corner of El Camino and San

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.980
Antonio roads.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.630
Now, a big part of Foursquare's
success is also

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.990
around the social elements of
its use, as indicated by this

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.150
screenshot.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.040
It's a way to share where you
are, let you know where your

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.750
friends are hanging out, and
all those sorts of things.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.490
But for today, we're going to
be focusing on its use while

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:52.690
you're on the road.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.670
And that's where I found it
to be the most compelling.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.540
When I'm away from home on a
trip, there's really no chance

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.800
I'm going to become the mayor
of anything except for maybe

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.170
the hotel that I'm saying at.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.700
So the app's primary use case
switches is from consistent

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.505
use of the same venues to
discovery and exploration.

00:05:07.505 --> 00:05:09.210
IAN NI-LEWIS: Now, this is the
part that I really wanted to

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.060
hear about because I have
avoided Foursquare forever.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.490
First, because it was a hipster
app, and second,

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.510
because I just couldn't see
the use in being a mayor.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.060
I'm the kind of person who's
so ultra-competitive that I

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.330
avoid competition just so
I don't have to lose.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.220
RETO MEIER: That's
pretty hard core.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.650
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.840
RETO MEIER: I like it.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.690
So when I lived in London, I'd
visit the mother ship here at

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:31.930
Google every three
months or so.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.390
And as soon as I landed in
SFO and checked in to the

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.310
terminal, it was game on--

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.730
coffee shops, hotels,
restaurants, hot dog stands,

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:39.980
pretty much anything.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.290
I used to travel with--

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.730
well, I think only once or twice
with Nick and Richard.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.230
And those guys would be on the
Cal train checking into each

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.540
Cal train stop as they
went past it.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.750
So as far as competition
goes, those guys

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.360
are pretty hard core.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.540
So the thrill of rocketing
up the leaderboard is a

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.940
short-term gain, although what
really makes this app a travel

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.040
assistance powerhouse is its
discoverability features.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.485
So back in--

00:06:02.485 --> 00:06:03.810
I can't even remember
when it was--

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.140
2009, 2010, whenever the Nexus
One came out I went on a

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.330
10-day European road show where
we hit something like

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.050
nine cities in 10 days, stayed
in each one just long enough

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.710
to get a good night's sleep,
hand out a couple Nexus Ones,

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.000
and grab a meal.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.800
So suddenly--

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.390
IAN NI-LEWIS: We don't do that
anymore, by the way.

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.850
We do not hand out
phones anymore.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:23.650
RETO MEIER: Which is sad.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:24.480
That was a lot of fun.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.600
It was an easy way to make
friends in foreign cities.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.060
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right?

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.550
It's like being those GIs in
World War II with their

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:30.420
chocolate and cigarettes.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.880
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:31.240
They loved me.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.220
Everywhere I went,
they loved me.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.460
I'm sure it had nothing to
do with the giveaways.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.750
So suddenly, having an app that
tells you where you can

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.860
get a good meal and rewards you
with points for doing so

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.910
really becomes very appealing.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.760
So I'm going to go into more
detail as to how the social

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.370
discovery service on
Foursquare works a

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:49.620
little later on.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.290
But first, let's take
a look at TripIt.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:54.860
IAN NI-LEWIS: Indeed.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:55.920
Oh wow.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:56.780
It's totally covered up.

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:57.725
OK.

00:06:57.725 --> 00:06:58.450
Oh, right.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:59.360
We're supposed to
do it this way.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.960
RETO MEIER: Yeah, clever, huh?

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.730
IAN NI-LEWIS: I love TripIt.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.980
By the way, I should
mention that Reto

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.570
fracking loves TripIt.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:06.910
RETO MEIER: I do.

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.160
I love it a lot.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.140
IAN NI-LEWIS: But I don't
fracking love it, because it's

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.280
not 2008 anymore.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:12.760
RETO MEIER: Burn!

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.620
IAN NI-LEWIS: When I started
going on business trips, I

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.740
didn't even have a cell phone,
much less a smartphone.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.470
I had to manually create my
own version of TripIt with

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:22.690
printouts of bookings, and
receipts, and flight

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.920
itineraries, and maps
to my apartment,

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.380
and maps to the train.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.600
And I kept doing
this for years.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.540
When I worked for Microsoft, I
tried to do it with a Windows

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:32.400
mobile phone.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.400
That didn't work out so well.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.410
Nothing against--

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:37.170
well, OK.

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:41.150
Anyway, later on, I switched to
an iPhone, and then when I

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:42.960
came here, I switched
to an Android phone.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.090
But honestly, the experience
was still unsatisfying.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.830
And the most important problem
was that my itineraries would

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.360
be in my email.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.690
And I'd have to make sure, A,
that it was synced to the

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:58.670
right folder in my email, and
B, that it synced and remain

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:03.190
synced and didn't get tossed out
by the time I needed it.

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:07.470
So I would frequently find
myself in line for, let's say,

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:11.310
a rental car, frantically
charging my phone off of my

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:16.000
laptop battery pack, just so I
could bring up an email that

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.420
told me where and when
I was supposed to be

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.250
at a certain place.

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.260
At this point, though, I don't
have to do any of that.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.950
With TripIt, I can just set it
up to go through my email and

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:31.490
find all of the travel-related
stuff, although it turns out

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:33.559
that the security guys at
Google don't like that.

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:34.830
So I had to stop that.

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:36.799
But fortunately, what you can
do is set up an email

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:38.130
forwarding rule.

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:41.280
Just take everything that you
get from Expedia or Carlson

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.100
Wagonlit or the other places
that we use to book travel and

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.480
just forward it on to TripIt.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.460
And TripIt will actually
figure out

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.850
what the email means.

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:53.650
It'll pull out all of the
details about you hotel and

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:55.290
about your flights.

00:08:55.290 --> 00:09:00.680
And then it will store that
and send you reminders

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.690
whenever you need them.

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:05.145
So by the time I'm sitting in
the taxi to go to the airport,

00:09:05.145 --> 00:09:08.190
I've got my entire trip right
in front of me-- hotels,

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:13.540
weather, cars, directions, even
information about what

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.480
friends of mine that use TripIt
are going to be in the

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.120
same place at the same time.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.710
But for me, the most exciting
part about TripIt is just the

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:22.470
way it seems to work
like magic.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:24.360
Everything just appears.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.790
It comes up when it should.

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:28.680
It lets me know what time
I need to be where.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.630
It figures out where I am
and where I need to be.

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:35.070
And it works offline without
having to connect up to an

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:36.850
internet, which is really,
really important as you're

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:40.300
traveling, because a lot of
times, internet access is

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:43.600
either unavailable or incredibly
expensive.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.170
It also does some clever
things with intents.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:49.360
And Reto's going to be going
over that a little bit later.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.460
But before we do that, it's time
to take a quick look at--

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:55.820
RETO MEIER: We're going
to take a look

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.380
at Share Where widget.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.020
IAN NI-LEWIS: Nice handoff.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:09:59.670
That was beautiful.

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:00.820
RETO MEIER: I thought
it was really clean.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:02.940
So I'm going to start to move
over to this side, because I

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:03.800
know that we're going
to be in frame.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.270
Now, I just want to take a
moment to comment on the

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:10.580
Google Play landing page for
Share Where location widget.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.160
I really love the icon here.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.490
It's got that distinctive shape
that provides really

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:17.640
strong branding and even a hint
as to what the app does

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.050
without resorting to that square
with rounded corners

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:21.530
that you see so much.

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:22.230
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.740
They have a great icon, and it
doesn't have a background.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:25.490
Love it.

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:25.930
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:28.560
It's also great to see that
they've got a feature graphic.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.260
But here I think they could
take another pass at this.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.950
The feature graphics are
really used in a lot of

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:36.350
different places, including on
the phone, not always at this

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:39.200
massive size and resolution
that you can see here.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.980
So a graphic like this that
includes a lot of text is

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:44.240
going to be pretty illegible
when it gets shrunk down into

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.160
the smaller sizes.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.250
So I'd suggest it you rely on
the description field, which

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:51.140
is just below it, to detail the
functionality of the app,

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:52.760
and really make the
feature graphic

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:53.820
a little more stylized.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:57.270
In the same that you've got this
great logo icon, make it

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:01.403
more like that so that you're
giving an idea of the app

00:11:01.403 --> 00:11:03.460
rather than trying to explain
everything within a small

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:03.950
feature graphic.

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:04.670
IAN NI-LEWIS: You know
what this feature

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:05.680
graphic says to me?

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:06.580
RETO MEIER: What does it say?

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:09.440
IAN NI-LEWIS: It says, they
hired a great designer, and he

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.990
made a great icon.

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:14.790
And then the CEO put together
the feature graphic.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:16.170
RETO MEIER: We've got
everything we need.

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:18.210
We don't need to pay another
guy a couple of grand to

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:19.360
create the feature graphic.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:19.980
IAN NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.040
I've got Photoshop.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:21.660
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.580
So yeah, maybe make it look
like a designer did the

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:25.650
feature graphic as well.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:27.270
I think that's really going
to help you out.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:30.490
It just gives you that much
more professional feel.

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:33.270
And now if we actually look at
the app itself, in terms of

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:36.090
functionality, this is
a much simpler--

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:39.160
maybe you would even say tighter
focus than either of

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.725
the other apps we're
looking at today.

00:11:40.725 --> 00:11:42.450
So the idea here is a
pretty simple one.

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:44.710
It lets you create a home screen
widget or a number of

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:48.340
home screen widgets which will
send preset messages to one or

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.230
more recipients.

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:52.090
And those messages can go out
via SMS, email, or actually

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:54.750
using any app that you
like using intents.

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:56.980
It's a simple concept, and one
which I actually considered

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:01.760
writing a while back, an app I
called one-click SMS, which

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:02.820
had a very similar idea.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.020
So if I just wanted to always
tell my wife I'm on my way

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.760
home when I was on my way home
without having to try and do

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.790
all the swipey stuff,
just press a button.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.020
And that's exactly what
this app does.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.870
So I love the idea of having a
one-touch emergency widget on

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:18.640
my home screen to let friends
and family know that I've

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.690
survived the inevitable
San Francisco

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:24.300
earthquake, or that I'm--

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:25.080
I'll try that again.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.120
And that I'm OK.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:30.080
Or that I'm not OK and having
my location embedded within

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.070
that message so that they know
where in the rubble to dig

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:34.880
through I think would be really
useful, as well as

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.150
things like I've arrived safely,
my flight's just

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:40.790
landed, I'm on my way home, any
of those sorts of things.

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:42.740
So being able to do all of that
really quickly without

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:45.630
having to scroll through
contacts lists or try and type

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:49.050
in a keyboard while I'm walking,
half-asleep with jet

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.340
lag, is really a plus.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.530
There's some UI work
that could be done

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:54.460
to improve the UX.

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:56.860
And I'll go into a little bit
more detail on that later.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.740
But they've done some great work
in terms of keeping the

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:01.450
functionality simple and using
intents to make the app even

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:04.270
powerful without having
to do much extra work.

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:06.915
So the best thing that they've
done is keep it simple in an

00:13:06.915 --> 00:13:10.370
app that does one thing, and
it does it very well.

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:11.840
IAN NI-LEWIS: Love it.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.570
So each of these apps offers
some valuable features to help

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:16.500
you when you're traveling.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.040
Taking a step back, let's take
a look at the key features

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:22.150
we're looking for in a pure
Android travel assistance app.

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:28.190
RETO MEIER: OK, so the feature
set of each of these apps are

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:29.000
kind of orthogonal.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.610
They're all really useful
for travelers.

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:33.760
But there's very
little overlap.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:34.430
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:38.170
So that's handy, because it
helps focus on how they're

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:41.470
achieving some of that magical
feature set rather than

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:43.420
debating the relative merits
of each feature.

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:44.400
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.610
So each of these apps needs to
work when I'm away from home,

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:49.450
because they're travel apps.

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:50.050
That's whole point.

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:52.560
And so that means that I'm
likely to be charging my phone

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:53.180
less often.

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.410
So battery life and battery
consumption

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.570
becomes really important.

00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:59.260
Data transfer is likely
to be slower.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:00.450
It's probably going
to be roaming.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:01.940
So it's probably going
to be expensive.

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:03.400
So back home, I may not care.

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.060
Suddenly, I'm in Italy.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.900
I'm paying a lot more for
my roaming costs.

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.830
So I care about that
data transfer.

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:10.550
And frankly, I'm probably going
to be turning it on and

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:12.100
off, depending on when
I need stuff.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.190
IAN NI-LEWIS: At the same time,
a lot of times when

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:17.950
you're traveling, you will get
great data every now and then,

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:19.220
like when you've got Wi-Fi.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:19.760
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.005
IAN NI-LEWIS: So in Italy, for
instance, they have Wi-Fi on

00:14:22.005 --> 00:14:22.550
the trains.

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:23.060
If you can hook up to that--

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:25.280
RETO MEIER: No, no-- they have
"wiffy" on the trains.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.200
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.860
RETO MEIER: In Italy,
it's all "wiffy."

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.320
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.050
(AUSTRALIAN ACCENT) Shrimp
on the barbie.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:32.850
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:35.450
IAN NI-LEWIS: Anyway, the point
is that you're not just

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:38.040
having nonexistent data or
expensive data, you're having

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:38.990
very intermittent data.

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:43.490
So when you do have Wi-Fi, or
"wiffy," or "wah-foe," or

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:47.190
whatever it is, you probably
want to take the most

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:47.890
advantage of that.

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:48.360
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.420
And of course, location
is key.

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:51.910
It's particularly important
because you want to

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:52.870
know where you are.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:56.250
But this has to balanced around
the fact that you don't

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:57.980
want to be draining the battery
getting those location

00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:58.830
updates all the time.

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:02.080
So it's really a balancing act
of wanting to have fresh data,

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:05.210
having constant data, working
offline, accurate location,

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:07.640
without draining the battery
when, chances are, you're

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:08.360
going to have your phone.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.880
You're going to be using it a
lot, but you're only going to

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.260
be charging it at the
end of every day.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.440
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:15.830
RETO MEIER: So the final result
really does emphasize

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:21.140
the efficiency of apps
serving this market.

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.100
IAN NI-LEWIS: So at last year's
I/O, Reto spent a bunch

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.660
of time talking about how to
ensure your app is always

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.630
fresh, which is extremely
important for apps.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:31.200
Is that an Android
using deodorant?

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.680
RETO MEIER: It is, to
maintain freshness.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:34.220
IAN NI-LEWIS: Silly person.

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:35.820
Androids don't smell.

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:37.270
RETO MEIER: I'm just going to
put that in front so everyone

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:40.510
can see the link to the
presentation as well.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:42.560
IAN NI-LEWIS: Indeed.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.660
RETO MEIER: Yeah, so it was all
about freshness, not just

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:48.230
about Androids using deodorant,
but also--

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:50.050
this is really important
for apps like

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:52.420
Foursquare and TripIt.

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:54.580
In these sorts of situations,
latency is your enemy,

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:58.020
particularly if you're late for
a train, or you're just

00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:59.950
tired after a long day of
sightseeing, and you just want

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:01.060
to find somewhere to eat.

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:02.870
What you don't want to do is
spend a lot of time waiting

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:05.640
for your phone to refresh, to
find a connection, to download

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:05.895
information.

00:16:05.895 --> 00:16:08.200
You just want to have everything
at your fingertips

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.270
so that you can glance at it and
keep running, basically.

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:17.452
So Let's take a look
at Foursquare in

00:16:17.452 --> 00:16:20.830
a little more detail.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:24.280
All right, so let me bring
up the giant phone.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:27.580
IAN NI-LEWIS: Giant
fake phone, wooo!

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.160
RETO MEIER: Perfect.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:33.090
So you can see that Foursquare
has done a fantastic job on

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:34.100
pretty much everything.

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:37.010
They've created something that's
really engaging, really

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:38.330
interesting, really
great to look at.

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.600
They've got a modern-looking
UI.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.022
You can look at it straightaway,
and you can see

00:16:42.022 --> 00:16:45.740
that it feels like a modern
Android phone.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:49.820
It's all using Holo theming,
all of that good stuff.

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:53.220
And what's really useful here
is that what Ian is

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:55.850
experimenting with here is the
local search feature, which we

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:56.760
were discussing beforehand.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.710
And that's kind of
the key here.

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:00.140
So you can see as we
go through here,

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:00.765
it's got the map.

00:17:00.765 --> 00:17:02.580
It's showing where
your friends are.

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:04.230
So if you're traveling in a
group, which is something we

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:07.239
used to do a lot of for things
like Google Developer Days and

00:17:07.239 --> 00:17:09.609
DevFests, you can see where
other people that you're

00:17:09.609 --> 00:17:11.270
traveling with are at.

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:13.930
Where's everyone going out for
a drink after the conference

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:14.530
is finished?

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:15.920
You can track them all down.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.150
You can find places that other
people have rated, perhaps on

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:19.010
previous trips.

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:22.099
So it's really a way for you to
be able to get some idea of

00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:25.060
confidence as to where
should I go?

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:26.069
I just want to grab a meal.

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:28.359
I'm in a place that I'm
not familiar with.

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:29.520
What's a good place?

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.290
Is there anywhere where it's
recommending in the nearby

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:35.000
neighborhood that you would
agree or disagree with?

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.500
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, absolutely,
Cafe Blaze.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.140
RETO MEIER: Blaze is great.

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.770
IAN NI-LEWIS: Excellent cafe.

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:41.770
RETO MEIER: So that's a good
choice that they've selected

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:42.870
there, actually.

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:45.450
And you can go through, and this
sort of consistent, clean

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:48.360
UI is pervasive throughout
the entire app.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:49.920
It shows you the information
that you want--

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.980
address, details, who's checked
in, photos, all of

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:56.540
that sort of information, and
does it in a really clean,

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:58.230
natural way.

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:00.620
Again, what I really like about
this is the simplicity.

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:03.060
It keeps everything
really simple.

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.840
It shows you the information
that you need without making

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.440
an overly complicated UI.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.610
So it really is something that's
easy to use and quite

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:11.870
addictive, I think.

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:13.900
You don't have this mountain
of information.

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.715
I think that's a challenge for
a lot of apps like this is

00:18:16.715 --> 00:18:18.440
that there are a lot
of venues around.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:22.650
So there's this tendency to just
drop 1,000 pins on the

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:23.870
screen at any given time.

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:25.560
And that's not actually
really useful.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.010
What you want to know is,
where do I want to go?

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:30.160
And this is somewhere where
choice can be a problem.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.670
If I'm standing on Castro
Street, I know there's a bunch

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:34.250
of restaurants around.

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:36.340
I want to know which one I
should go to based on the

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:38.650
things that I like, that my
friends have checked in to,

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:39.490
and those sorts of things.

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:40.364
And that's something which
I think they do a

00:18:40.364 --> 00:18:41.410
really good job of.

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:42.110
IAN NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:44.890
And just as a side note, you can
see that the design here

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:45.660
is really beautiful.

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:46.710
And they've done some
of the things that

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:48.880
we've talked about--

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:52.550
putting your media front and
center, making sure that you

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:53.970
make good use of space.

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:58.870
Every time something is blank,
it's for a reason, but mostly,

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:01.510
just bringing up these
beautiful, beautiful pictures.

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:01.990
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:03.240
I mean, that's what
this is all about.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:06.500
I mean, what Foursquare has ,
which a lot of other apps

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.600
which are offering similar
services don't, is a huge

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.710
community of people which
are contributing to the

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:12.500
information here.

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.210
So we have lots of pictures
contributed by users which you

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:18.070
can trust, because it's not the
picture that the owner has

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:21.360
taken on the day where he's
cleared out everyone and given

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:22.800
everything a spic-and-span
clean.

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.720
It's pictures which people have
taken while they've been

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:25.820
hanging out there.

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:27.860
So they've done a
really good job.

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:30.790
So what I want to talk about a
little bit is use this as an

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:35.810
excuse to talk a little bit
about how Foursquare have done

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:38.260
the job that they have done.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:42.870
It's simple enough to get
location updates for Android.

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:45.950
But what Foursquare have done a
really good job of is making

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:48.920
sure that location updates are
as low latency as possible.

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.930
So there's a few tricks you
can use to maintain your

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:54.110
location freshness without
draining the battery

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:55.140
completely.

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:57.200
So you can significantly
reduce the battery--

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.760
sorry, you can significantly
reduce the latency for getting

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.860
your first location fix by
retrieving the last known

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.220
location from the location
manager each

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:07.360
time the app is resumed.

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.020
So if you have a look at
this code snippet--

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:11.980
I'll just pop that in front as
well so you can perhaps read

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:14.300
that a little bit more easily.

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:16.870
So in this snippet, we're going
to iterate through each

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:19.580
location provider on the device,
including those that

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:21.100
aren't currently available.

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:24.320
And we're going to seek out
the most timely and most

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.320
accurate last known location.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.210
So if there's one or more
locations available from

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:31.900
within the allowed time frame,
then we can return the one

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:33.470
which has the most
accurate result.

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:35.060
And if there isn't,
then we return

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:36.580
the most recent results.

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:38.850
Though if we're just doing
that-- the most recent result,

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:40.760
but it's kind of beyond
our latency window--

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:43.300
it's pretty good practice to
request a single location

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:47.130
update from every available
provider to try and get a more

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:48.050
recent result.

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:50.950
At this point, it doesn't even
matter which is the more

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:51.670
accurate result.

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:54.850
You just want to get something
that's a little more timely so

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:56.620
that you get something
which is in the

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.100
vaguely correct location.

00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:59.940
And then obviously, you can
continue to do your location

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:03.540
updates to try and get something
even more useful.

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:04.780
IAN NI-LEWIS: So one thing that
I've always wanted to ask

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:06.565
you, Reto, about location,
because I know you're kind of

00:21:06.565 --> 00:21:07.500
the location guy.

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:08.010
RETO MEIER: Sure.

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:10.250
IAN NI-LEWIS: So I remember
when I first started

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:12.450
traveling, and this was way back
in the Dark Ages when we

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:15.830
didn't have offline maps and
we didn't have really good

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:16.700
location providers.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:20.080
And I found out an app called
Maverick that was mostly for

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.520
geocaching.

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:25.670
And so they made it work
in the wilderness.

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:26.070
RETO MEIER: Nice.

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:28.100
IAN NI-LEWIS: And it turned
out that for me, anyway,

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:30.850
coming from the US, London
was the wilderness.

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:31.550
RETO MEIER: Effectively.

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:34.960
IAN NI-LEWIS: So what it did was
it allowed me to download

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.800
a bunch of map tiles,
which may or may not

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.280
actually been legal.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.630
RETO MEIER: It downloaded
them regardless.

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:40.720
IAN NI-LEWIS: Indeed.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:45.850
And then it would find GPS, but
it also kept track of my

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:49.370
location through
dead reckoning.

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:52.660
Do any of the phones we have
now do that automatically?

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.450
Is that part of the
location provider?

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:55.400
RETO MEIER: Not that
I'm aware of, no.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.300
I think the location providers
that we're using at the moment

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:00.400
are fairly simplistic
in that it's just

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.225
GPS or network location--

00:22:03.225 --> 00:22:03.870
what do we call it?

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:07.870
NLP, Network Location
Provider.

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:11.910
So using cell ID and Wi-Fi
rather than momentum and dead

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:14.140
reckoning and those sorts of
things, although I think

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:16.250
that's something which the
industry is heading towards.

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:16.800
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.530
RETO MEIER: So it would be
fantastic to see more and more

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:21.930
of those sorts of features
become part of the location

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:23.010
providers available.

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:24.560
IAN NI-LEWIS: Wouldn't
that be great?

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:27.670
Now, what implications does that
have for power, though?

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:29.430
RETO MEIER: Well, I guess that's
kind of the question.

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:31.980
And that's one of the important
reasons why within

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:34.290
Android, you shouldn't be
specifying a particular

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:35.300
location provider.

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:38.110
So at the moment, it's just
assumed that GPS is going to

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:40.530
drain your battery, and the
network location provider is

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:42.950
going to be relatively
low-power.

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:46.070
But these days, it's actually
becoming a point where a lot

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:48.450
of the GPS chips are becoming
more and more power efficient

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:51.790
and getting built into the
hardware itself so that the

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:54.260
actual location drain is
significantly lower.

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:57.310
By comparison, the network
location providers are using a

00:22:57.310 --> 00:23:01.100
lot more features, things like
gyroscopes, things like

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:04.720
momentum, all of those things
which can comparatively

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.730
increase its battery drain.

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:09.140
So what it then means is it's
kind of up to the system to

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:12.430
figure out how to balance those
things and provide you

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:14.800
with as accurate a result
as you can without

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:15.570
draining the battery.

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:18.380
And so for us right now, that
means using things like

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:22.700
criteria to specify a location
provider based on the power

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:26.240
drain or the accuracy you need
rather than saying, hey, I

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.410
think that this implies that,
so I'm going to use that

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:30.040
particular provider.

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:32.570
IAN NI-LEWIS: So as with many
things Android, you really

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:36.540
don't want to go too low-level
yourself, because you know

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:37.790
that things are going
to get better.

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:40.000
And they're going to get better
in a very unpredictable

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.860
way, where on some devices
they're much better in terms

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:44.230
of power, for instance.

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:47.190
And other devices, they haven't
made those changes.

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:51.040
So you're always safest going
with the basic system.

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:54.910
And then if you absolutely
have to tweak things for

00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:57.160
specific classes of devices,
maybe you want to do that.

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:57.830
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:00.500
A good example is if you're
creating a device which lets

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:03.520
you understand how many GPS
satellites you've got in

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.340
view-- and we looked at a couple
of these apps a little

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:07.210
while ago, some of
these GPS apps.

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:09.310
Clearly they want the GPS
provider, whether it's

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:11.335
accurate or draining the battery
or whatever, they

00:24:11.335 --> 00:24:12.010
don't really care.

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:13.140
That's not the point.

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:14.290
For everything else,
you want to be as

00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:15.400
high-level as possible.

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.790
And then trust that as the
framework team are able to

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:20.360
make improvements to these APIs,
that suddenly your app

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.280
will get better and more
efficient and more accurate

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.520
without you actually having
to do anything.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:24.130
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:25.830
Yeah, I think this
is a good area.

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:29.020
If you're doing a location app,
stay tuned and make sure

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:32.220
you follow not only Android,
but the different chipset

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:34.730
vendors and see what kind of
changes they're making,

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:36.220
because I know there's
a lot of active

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:37.280
research in this area.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:37.500
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:40.430
I think we've been hearing a lot
about things like passive

00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:41.650
background location updates.

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:45.310
And you can see apps like Google
Now, in fact, being

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:48.190
able to give you these really
cool hints about how far

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:53.710
you've walked or suggesting
things based on your location

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:54.460
and those sorts of stuff.

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:55.320
So that's kind of cool.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.080
I'm going to talk a little bit
about how you can do some of

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.790
those things in just a minute.

00:24:58.790 --> 00:24:59.160
IAN NI-LEWIS: Great.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:24:59.530
Let's do that.

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:01.960
RETO MEIER: So generally, I
prefer to use pending intents

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.160
rather than location
listeners when I'm

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.410
making my location requests.

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:07.560
And that's because it offers the
flexibility of registering

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.420
receivers in multiple activities
or services or even

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.240
directly in a manifest.

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.910
In fact, by doing that, you
can make your app silently

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:17.040
update your location, just like
what we mentioned, and

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.700
potentially even update the
list of nearby venues.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.950
So an app like Foursquare can
passively listen for these

00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:26.270
location changes, and then in
the background every once in a

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:28.660
while actually pull down
nearby locations.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:31.680
So when you open the app, you're
not waiting for that

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.770
feeling like it's
interminable.

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:34.440
Come on.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.955
Yeah, I was there half
an hour ago.

00:25:35.955 --> 00:25:36.960
I'm here now.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.910
Just give me something
more reasonable.

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:41.280
IAN NI-LEWIS: And let's
remember, too, that while

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:44.010
you're doing this, it's very,
very important to persist that

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:44.600
information.

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:49.210
Because you're pending intents
and any listener of this type

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:51.450
is going to be running in the
background, which means that

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:54.730
if the user, let's say, boots up
a game or starts to run out

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:57.230
of battery, you're going to be
on the list to be killed.

00:25:57.230 --> 00:26:00.940
And if you're keeping that
information in memory, then

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:01.800
it's just going to go away.

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.200
And essentially, you've
just wasted a bunch

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.040
of power for nothing.

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.940
So make absolutely sure that
that gets persisted out to

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:10.140
either a content provider or
your own file system database

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:11.220
or whatever.

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:12.040
RETO MEIER: Share preferences
can be a good

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:12.490
one for that as well.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:15.330
IAN NI-LEWIS: There
you go, exactly.

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:15.730
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:19.425
So now requesting locations
updates, particularly if

00:26:19.425 --> 00:26:21.610
you're using something like GPS,
anything which is high

00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:23.970
power while your app isn't
in the foreground, is

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:25.000
kind of a bad idea.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:25.940
It's going to drain
the battery.

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:28.240
It's going to make
people angry.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.440
So what you're going to do
instead is use a passive

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:33.680
location provider to piggyback
your location updates when

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:35.820
other apps are requesting
them.

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:38.780
So again, I'm going to pop
the code in front.

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:41.310
So you can see in this code
snippet, we request location

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:43.850
updates using a passive
provider, this thing in a

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:46.590
broadcast, of pending intent
whenever it receives any of

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:48.030
those changes.

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:50.940
And it includes a receiver
definition as well down at the

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:54.160
bottom, which is what you put
in your manifest, which is

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:57.560
then going to listen for those
broadcast intents in order so

00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.630
that you can then do something
with them.

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:02.060
So within our receiver
definition, we can choose what

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:04.565
to do when those new locations
coming in, which may be store

00:27:04.565 --> 00:27:07.440
the location for later use,
though often, that's going to

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.050
be duplicating the work that
you can do just by querying

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:12.580
the get last known location.

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:14.710
Or you can do other things
like pre-fetching nearby

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:16.700
locations when certain
conditions are met.

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:18.890
So you may want to do that much
less frequently than the

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:20.830
updates that you
are receiving.

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:22.100
IAN NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:24.375
Now, the door has just opened,
and Billy is sticking is head

00:27:24.375 --> 00:27:25.890
in, so there's something
wrong with the show.

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:27.550
What's wrong, Billy?

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:27.870
No?

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:29.226
BILLY: All good.

00:27:29.226 --> 00:27:29.680
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:30.310
RETO MEIER: Outstanding.

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.810
IAN NI-LEWIS: Beautiful.

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:31.980
RETO MEIER: He's just
making sure we're

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:32.900
actually doing work.

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:34.380
We're not just sitting
in here drinking.

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:35.440
IAN NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:39.000
RETO MEIER: I respect his
confidence in us.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.320
IAN NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.630
RETO MEIER: Let's move on.

00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:47.820
That's an entirely blank screen,
very disconcerting.

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:49.100
IAN NI-LEWIS: Mike Winton,
don't ever stick

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:49.890
your head in again.

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:53.430
You screwed up everything.

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:55.370
RETO MEIER: So this technique
of pre-fetching

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:56.670
can be really powerful.

00:27:56.670 --> 00:27:59.300
But it's also inherently risky,
as you're introducing

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:02.410
battery and bandwidth cost by
downloading data that may

00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:03.670
never actually be necessary.

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:06.590
So if you're looking at a travel
assistance app, that

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:07.890
can be kind of touch and go.

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:09.310
And that's something which
I think Foursquare are

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:11.460
really aware of.

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:15.040
And this is an app, where again,
that balance between

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:17.440
being an app that you use a lot
at home and an app that's

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:20.240
really useful when you're away
becomes an interesting balance

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.750
of how do you maintain that
freshness without draining the

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:25.070
battery and becoming something
which people don't want to

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:26.700
have running when they're
overseas.

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.440
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, I think this
actually starts to get

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:33.950
into the secret sauce of what
makes an app truly amazing and

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:34.930
what it means--

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:36.460
for instance, we've talked
about this with the video

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:40.500
apps, where everybody and their
brother uses some form

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:46.590
of media player on any platform,
Flash player on the

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:47.780
web, for instance.

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:49.820
But where the secret sauce comes
in is how do you make

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:53.720
something start really fast and
play at a good bandwidth

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:55.420
and switch bandwidth easily.

00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:59.040
And in location apps, it's
really, how do you know when a

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.460
person's going to
try and use it?

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:03.210
If you look at what we've done
with Google Now, it really

00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:06.340
tries to predict based on your
past behavior, what you're

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:08.510
going to need at a
particular point.

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:10.820
And I think that when you look
at Foursquare, you're seeing

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:12.750
some of the smarts and some
of those intelligences.

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:15.970
You could probably even go
further and make it into

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:18.240
something where you kind
of know when the

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.160
app's going to be needed.

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:23.830
Because you can see where the
user is, and even how fast

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:27.890
they're going and what time of
day it is, and predict what

00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:29.260
kind of information they're
going to need.

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:30.440
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:33.450
So another useful best practice
is monitoring the

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:35.010
state of your providers.

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:36.400
So this is kind of important.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.910
When you make a location update
request, even when

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:41.320
you're using criteria, the
location manager is just going

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:44.390
to choose one of those providers
whose updates it's

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:45.050
going to monitor.

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:48.730
So whatever provider happens to
be active, whether the user

00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:53.170
has GPS ticked or the network
location provided ticked, it's

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:54.500
going to try make
a determination

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:55.380
based on what's available.

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:57.600
But that can change
in real time.

00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.820
So again, I'm going to
stick this code--

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:01.790
yeah, I'm going to stick
this in front.

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:05.100
Then I can move around
a little bit more.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:07.100
So this snippet is monitoring
two conditions.

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:09.690
It's checking to find out the
location provider that we're

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:12.170
using to see if it's
being deactivated.

00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:13.720
So a user can turn
these on and off.

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:16.210
So it's checking to make sure
that, OK, we've decided to use

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:19.880
GPS, and the user goes
and turns off GPS.

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:23.410
We're going to be able to then
find another provider.

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:25.340
And likewise, we're going to
check to see if there is

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:26.930
another provider that
becomes available.

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:29.260
So maybe we would have used GPS,
but it was disabled, and

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:30.090
then it gets turned on.

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:32.720
We want to switch without the
user having to exit the app

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:35.690
and come back in or manually
do something that way.

00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:37.880
It should all happen
dynamically.

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:39.630
In either case, we're just going
to re-run the process

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:43.270
used to determine which provider
that is currently

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:46.490
available is best for
our current needs.

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:48.390
And this technique ensures
that we can continue to

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:51.400
receive location updates without
interruption even if

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.440
the user is totaling
GPS and network

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.690
location provider details.

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:02.090
That's interesting.

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:04.040
I'm sure that there was
a picture behind us.

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:06.940
Nonetheless, you can find all of
these tips in great detail

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:10.320
in the "Deep Dive into Location"
blog post that is

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.990
actually on the next page.

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:13.040
IAN NI-LEWIS: I am so sorry.

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:16.310
I fixed almost all of those
typography errors.

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:18.290
And this one, I guess
I didn't see it.

00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:20.370
RETO MEIER: That's OK, but
nonetheless, so this is a blog

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:22.570
post I wrote mid-last
year, I think.

00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:25.950
I even created a sample project
that includes the

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:28.115
basic Foursquare
functionality--

00:31:28.115 --> 00:31:29.770
let's see, I have
to do two jumps.

00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:30.680
There we go--

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.490
for finding nearby venues.

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:34.940
So this is displaying them in
a list that allows you to

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:39.820
check in using Google Places
API, which you can find here.

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:41.440
Basically, its all of the sorts
of things that we were

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.970
talking about, all those best
practices around using passive

00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:48.490
location provider, monitoring
location provider changes, and

00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:50.170
being able to make sure that
you're doing everything in the

00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:53.030
background in an intelligent way
that hopefully isn't going

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:54.280
to drain your battery.

00:31:57.692 --> 00:32:00.050
IAN NI-LEWIS: Now with TripIt,
the need for freshness is a

00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:01.300
little more different.

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:05.850
The important thing
about TripIt is--

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:08.055
and let's bring up the giant
fake phone, shall we?

00:32:08.055 --> 00:32:10.150
RETO MEIER: Oh, of course.

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:13.930
IAN NI-LEWIS: So with TripIt,
you're going to have--

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:16.660
you don't have any actual plans
in here, but I notice

00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:17.990
that some of your friends do.

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:19.725
RETO MEIER: I was going to go
back to a trip that I did.

00:32:19.725 --> 00:32:21.650
I think that's probably going
to be the easiest.

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:24.130
In fact, let me navigate
through that.

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:25.500
Let me go to past trips.

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:27.660
IAN NI-LEWIS: The idea with
TripIt is that it's all of

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:29.970
your travel information
in one place.

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:34.110
And it's going to show you the
most relevant thing first and

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:36.710
try and remove all the
irrelevant nonsense.

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:39.980
So it needs to know what time
it is, and it needs to know

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:41.270
where you are.

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:46.220
So in this particular case,
for instance, knowing that

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:50.290
we're going from Melbourne to
Perth is only important if we

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:51.740
are not in Perth.

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:52.590
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:54.160
IAN NI-LEWIS: And you
could find that in

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.930
two different ways.

00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:59.400
You could find that out either
through location or by time.

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:01.875
But probably location is a
little safer because the

00:33:01.875 --> 00:33:03.380
flight may have been delayed.

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:04.640
RETO MEIER: Or I may have
missed the flight.

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.060
IAN NI-LEWIS: Indeed.

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:08.340
Same thing with the hotel, same
thing with everything.

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:12.150
The idea is, once you've got
there, you don't need to see

00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:12.710
it anymore.

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:17.640
So it doesn't need to be updated
perhaps as frequently

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.690
as Foursquare does.

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:25.460
But it does need to update at
least in time to be able to

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:28.130
show and hide this
information.

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:29.570
RETO MEIER: And one of the other
things which I think is

00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:32.890
really important is it needs
to be able to update--

00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:34.120
there's sort of this balance.

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:36.540
Because if something does
change, if my flight time

00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:39.500
changes or my hotel booking
changes, I need to see that

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:40.830
updated straightaway.

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:42.770
And that needs to be as low
latency as possible.

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:46.030
But the frequency of that
is pretty rare.

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:48.990
Once the travel is booked,
you're going to be lucky if

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:51.066
there's a change once
a day, if that.

00:33:51.066 --> 00:33:51.550
IAN NI-LEWIS: Indeed.

00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:54.030
You certainly don't want to be
checking every five minutes to

00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:55.130
see if your flight's delayed.

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:58.050
Instead, what you really want
is to know exactly when your

00:33:58.050 --> 00:33:59.710
flight's delayed and
then never worry

00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:01.440
about it again, right?

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:04.630
So if I was doing this with just
my airline, my airline is

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:07.340
going to send me an SMS
to let me know that

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:08.190
the flight's delayed.

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:10.570
Now I don't want TripIt to send
me an SMS because there's

00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:12.550
a better way to do
that, right?

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:14.270
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:15.480
You would want to--

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:17.310
yeah, exactly.

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:19.900
IAN NI-LEWIS: In fact, I think
what we want is to--

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:22.080
hopefully what it
does is use GCM.

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.100
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:26.770
So let's have a look at some of
the things which you should

00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:29.280
be able to do and
do really well.

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:30.699
So knowing where we
are is important.

00:34:30.699 --> 00:34:35.320
But it's much more important
that I get my itinerary

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:37.179
changes as quickly
as possible.

00:34:37.179 --> 00:34:38.280
And as I mentioned--

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:41.140
let me see if I can drop
this behind us.

00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:42.600
It's neater.

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:44.100
Ah, that looks a bit weird.

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:48.380
Nonetheless, but this does
set up a conflict.

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:53.340
And like we said, it's that
idea of we want things to

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:54.909
happen straightaway, but we
don't want to have to do these

00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:56.440
manual updates.

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:59.990
And so what that does
is that we--

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:01.400
IAN NI-LEWIS: I love these
graphs that you make.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:05.561
Because they're complete
nonsense, but they do get the

00:35:05.561 --> 00:35:05.885
idea across.

00:35:05.885 --> 00:35:08.120
RETO MEIER: It goes up
and to the right,

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:09.570
up and to the right.

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:11.790
So it's a good graph.

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:14.750
Do the obvious graphs, people.

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:18.830
So again, it's this how do we
reduce the latency but not

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:19.880
have that increase
in battery life?

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:22.520
And that's genuinely what
happens, is that the fresher

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:25.330
the data is, the more
battery cost.

00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:27.010
And where you actually want to
be is somewhere down here,

00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:30.870
where you zero latency and
maximum battery life.

00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:31.713
Interesting.

00:35:31.713 --> 00:35:34.726
I think that was
my microphone.

00:35:34.726 --> 00:35:36.070
You have to dance while
I fix this.

00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:37.320
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:40.430
RETO MEIER: Nice.

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:42.000
IAN NI-LEWIS: Dance,
monkey, dance.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.180
The reason I'm dancing instead
of sharing technical

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:46.160
information is because
I was sick yesterday.

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:49.290
So Reto had to script this
whole show himself.

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:51.730
And he's only been a little
bit bitter about it.

00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:54.400
RETO MEIER: Only a little.

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.810
So even if you're not
downloading anything every

00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:58.740
time you do the poll, you're
still potentially

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:00.000
draining the battery.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.750
And that's because of the way
that the battery life cycle

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:07.050
model works-- or I should say
the cell network life cycle.

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:09.750
Or the cell radio, which is
going to say on high power for

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:13.600
around 10 seconds and around low
power for up to a minute

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:14.950
every time you ping a server.

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:18.150
Even if the server is
going, it's cool,

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.860
nothing you need to do.

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:20.740
It's still going to
drain the battery.

00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:23.620
So if you're doing these updates
every minute, then

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:25.480
you're just leaving the cell
radio on permanently, which is

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:27.620
going to destroy your
battery life.

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:29.960
And so this is compounded by
the typical update rates of

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:32.780
apps like TripIt, where if my
itinerary changes, I want that

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:36.290
update, like, now, like
as soon as it happens.

00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:38.100
But it's not going to
happen that often.

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:41.390
So how can we optimize
those updates and

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:43.920
minimize the latency?

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:44.930
Well, in fact--

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:47.280
and the most important
the answer is to use

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.530
Google Cloud Messaging.

00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:50.840
Like, seriously, use Google
Cloud Messaging.

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:53.560
It is going to solve most
of these problems.

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.080
It's something which
TripIt, as far as I

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.070
can tell, has done.

00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:58.740
Because there is that option to
choose manual slash push.

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:01.140
And I had a look in their
manifest, and they are using

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:01.700
those things.

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:03.550
But they still have the
options for those more

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:04.410
frequent updates.

00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:08.200
So I want to hear from the guys
at TripIt and find out,

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:09.510
are you using it exclusively?

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:10.970
If not, why not?

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:13.390
And is there a reason for still
having that option to do

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:15.120
the manual polling, which
is just going

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:16.270
to drain the battery.

00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:18.560
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, there was
a time when Google Cloud

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:26.440
Messaging was C2DM, and
there was a cap.

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:28.050
You could only send so
many messages a day.

00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:29.690
Now, that's not in
place anymore.

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:30.240
RETO MEIER: That's true.

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.800
IAN NI-LEWIS: So it may be
that in the past it was

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:34.850
difficult for them to guarantee
that they wouldn't

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:35.790
hit their C2DM limit.

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:37.060
RETO MEIER: That could
well be the case.

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:40.020
IAN NI-LEWIS: Now, of course,
Google Cloud Messaging isn't

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:40.930
doing anything magical.

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:43.200
It's just taking advantage of
the fact that a lot of apps

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:44.400
want to do this sort of thing.

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:48.090
So it makes a lot more sense to
coalesce that into one ping

00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:51.950
that's done intelligently with
battery life in mind rather

00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:55.360
than having everyone ping their
servers at whatever time

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:56.020
they feel like.

00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:56.490
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:58.550
So it's a way that you can send
a message to a particular

00:37:58.550 --> 00:38:02.290
device or set of devices used
by a particular user,

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:04.760
informing the app running on
that device that there's

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:06.390
updates which they
need to retrieve.

00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:08.980
So the result is near-instant
updates with none of the

00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:09.620
battery drain.

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:12.410
Or at least your app doesn't
get blamed for any of the

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:15.050
battery drain caused by--

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:16.790
which you would normally get
with regular poling.

00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:20.110
So you get to blame it all on
Google, which is much cooler.

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:21.920
If anyone's going to get blamed
for battery drain, it

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.330
may as well be the system
rather than

00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:24.960
your app, if you can.

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:27.010
So that's kind of
a no-brainer.

00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:28.570
Similarly, you'll want
to pre-fetch as

00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:29.890
much data as possible.

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:31.220
And it's particularly important

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:31.990
for an app like TripIt.

00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:34.530
And it's something that they do
really well, in that I had

00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:36.370
to think about whether or not
they did, which made me

00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:37.310
realize that they must.

00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:38.122
Because otherwise, I
would have thrown

00:38:38.122 --> 00:38:39.425
it through a window.

00:38:39.425 --> 00:38:41.440
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:43.460
RETO MEIER: Offline access
here is absolutely vital.

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:45.970
For a lot of travel,
particularly when we were

00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:48.480
jumping from country to country,
you don't have the

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:51.590
opportunity to buy a local SIM
just for the data, which you

00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:53.410
often do if you're going to
be there for a week or so.

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:55.860
If you're going to spend 12
hours, you're just going to

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:58.230
have your core global roaming
SIM, and you're going to

00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:59.970
disable data a lot.

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:00.560
Airports--

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:02.700
it often takes a long time once
you get out of flight

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:04.890
mode for the data connection
to start back up.

00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:07.740
And I want to know where to
tell the taxi driver to go

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:11.730
without having to wait half an
hour for my phone to turn on

00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:16.010
or to find Wi-Fi in order to be
able to get those updates.

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:18.300
So for apps like Foursquare,
though,

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:19.840
pre-fetching can be tricky.

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:23.280
Because there's no knowing which
places a user is going

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:25.560
to want to check into, or what
areas, what categories they're

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:26.400
going to want to explore.

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:29.120
And you can't pre-fetch
everything because that would

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:32.480
just be a huge battery drain
and a huge bandwidth drain,

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.010
particularly if you're
roaming.

00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:36.490
So pre-fetching can be kind of
a cat and mouse game between

00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:39.390
trying to get the right details
without wasting too

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:40.770
much bandwidth.

00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:43.490
So for apps like TripIt, where
the information users want is

00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:46.230
relatively small,
well-encapsulated around a

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:48.886
trip, and entirely
predictable--

00:39:48.886 --> 00:39:50.570
you even know when they're
going traveling.

00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:52.540
So you can wait to do the
pre-fetching until the day

00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:55.320
before, pull it all down, stick
it on the device, and

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:56.740
then it's just there, and
it's just working.

00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:58.770
So you can go into offline
airplane mode, and it all

00:39:58.770 --> 00:40:00.980
still works.

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:03.320
So in that instance, I think
pre-fetching can be really,

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.230
really powerful.

00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:08.060
On the same lines, it's really
important that you limit

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:09.380
bandwidth as much as possible.

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:12.030
And that means caching results,
particularly images,

00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:14.500
or anything that's likely
to remain static.

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:17.730
Better still, your server should
specify the lifetime

00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:19.970
and update time stamps
of its responses.

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:23.712
And that's what you can see in
this piece of code, which I'm

00:40:23.712 --> 00:40:26.150
just going to step back from it
rather than go full screen.

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:28.590
So in this code snippet, we're
just checking the server

00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:30.960
response headers to see if we
actually need to bother

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:32.730
downloading the rest
of response body.

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:35.000
So this is still going to cost
you in terms of hitting the

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.480
server to see whether there's
anything to get.

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:39.375
But at least you're not then
downloading extra data that

00:40:39.375 --> 00:40:41.780
you already have or that hasn't
changed since the last

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:42.840
time you pinged the server.

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.530
IAN NI-LEWIS: If it's possible
to look ahead, too, and

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:48.100
determine how fresh each
piece of data is,

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:48.880
that's really useful.

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:53.000
Because in a lot of apps, I
would much rather know that a

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.070
piece of data is stale than to
not see it all and see a

00:40:57.070 --> 00:40:58.760
loading bar or a progress
bar instead.

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:00.650
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:03.940
So it's probably also worth
mentioning that network state

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:07.690
and the type of network that
you're connected to you can

00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:10.710
also be really important in
determining the frequency of

00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:12.760
your data transfers and the
aggressiveness of your

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:13.340
pre-fetching.

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:15.220
So you can actually monitor
all of that.

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:17.560
As you can see in this code
snippet, where we're checking

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:22.040
the server response headers,
that doesn't seem true.

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:25.620
So in this snippet, what we're
doing is modifying the size of

00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:27.460
the pre-fetching
cache depending

00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:28.420
on the network speed.

00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:30.810
So we're going to increase it
when we're on Wi-Fi or on 4G,

00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:33.870
or we're going to drop it down
when we're on slower networks.

00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:35.970
And so again, what we're doing
here is trying to find a

00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:40.260
better balance between battery
drain and latency reduction.

00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:49.070
I do go into much more detail on
this, on how to create apps

00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:51.880
that are more efficient in my
I/O talk from earlier this

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:53.640
year, which is the link here.

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:56.460
It's bit.ly/protips2.

00:41:56.460 --> 00:42:01.190
And there are more details on
creating efficient download

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:04.300
patterns in this Android
training class as well.

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:06.660
IAN NI-LEWIS: I love that pro
tips picture, by the way.

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:08.000
Did JJ Abrams make
that for you?

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:08.795
RETO MEIER: He did, yeah.

00:42:08.795 --> 00:42:09.230
IAN NI-LEWIS: Nice.

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:09.430
RETO MEIER: Yeah, yeah.

00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:12.020
I know a guy.

00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:15.470
So finally, let's take a closer
look at Share Where,

00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:17.350
which is our third app.

00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:19.020
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's
Share Aware, of

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:21.580
course, not just Shareware.

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:23.110
It could be Shareware.

00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:24.450
RETO MEIER: I think it's
just Share Where.

00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:25.400
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, it
is Share Where.

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:28.310
RETO MEIER: Because it's "where"
with, like, "where."

00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:29.440
Homonyms for the win.

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.870
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's Share,
Where, not shareware.

00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:33.010
RETO MEIER: Not shareware.

00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:33.580
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:34.020
RETO MEIER: No.

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:34.840
Don't share this app.

00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:35.720
That would be piracy.

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:36.680
And that would be bad.

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:37.300
IAN NI-LEWIS: Wonderful.

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:38.860
RETO MEIER: Now unlike Fes--

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:39.740
unlike Fairsquare?

00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:43.030
Unlike Foursquare and TripIt,
Share Where, which is what

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:46.130
I've written there, was
self-nominated and isn't yet

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:47.520
an editor's choice
on Google Play.

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:49.660
And so we're going to try and
be a little bit more--

00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:51.730
IAN NI-LEWIS: We can
go nuts on this.

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:55.540
RETO MEIER: So we were going
to try and be a little more

00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:56.510
constructive.

00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:57.090
Let's say constructive.

00:42:57.090 --> 00:42:57.760
IAN NI-LEWIS: There you go.

00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.150
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:00.510
Because you know, you put
your app up here.

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:02.725
I'm going to assume that you
want to have our feedback, or

00:43:02.725 --> 00:43:03.590
you wouldn't have
asked for it.

00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:06.290
But our goal is to still set
it up-- to bring it up to a

00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:09.680
standard where we can show it
off to everyone else in our

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:10.870
pure Android collection.

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:13.680
So that's pretty much the goal
for any app that we look here.

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:15.380
We want to bring it up to
something which we can show

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:17.050
off to everyone else as a
great example of an app

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:18.650
IAN NI-LEWIS: Like you said
earlier in your morbid

00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:21.825
preamble, this is an app that
has great functionality.

00:43:21.825 --> 00:43:22.200
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.700
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's something
that we really want to own,

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:27.890
but maybe not in this
exact form.

00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:29.040
RETO MEIER: Yeah, exactly.

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:31.190
So we're going to give the
developer a chance to share

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:32.810
their experiences in
implementing some of our

00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:35.375
suggestions and even explaining
some of the choices

00:43:35.375 --> 00:43:38.070
that they've made in later
episodes of "Developers Strike

00:43:38.070 --> 00:43:40.250
Back." So stay tuned for that.

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:42.555
But let's have a look
at the app.

00:43:42.555 --> 00:43:44.930
IAN NI-LEWIS: Let's do.

00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:46.840
RETO MEIER: So thinking behind
this app is pretty

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:48.100
straightforward.

00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:50.790
Let's just bring the
giant phone up.

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:53.260
So the idea here is that you're
going to create a bunch

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:55.760
of home screen widgets, which
all have predefined messages

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:58.450
which you can set to a
predefined audience.

00:43:58.450 --> 00:44:02.490
So in case of emergency, or I've
just come home, I've just

00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:04.170
landed, any of those things,
you can do it

00:44:04.170 --> 00:44:05.780
all ahead of time.

00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:08.280
Now, what happens when you load
the app up the first time

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:10.990
is you get this massive
screen of options.

00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:12.580
Now, it is a widget app.

00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:14.730
And there is a challenge
associated with widget apps in

00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:19.220
that you can't just have the
main launcher icon launch the

00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:20.660
app widget selector.

00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:24.990
So you have to find a way to add
meaningful value in that

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:26.550
when you first open
up the app.

00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:28.710
And that's a challenge that we
see a lot of widget apps do.

00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:31.180
And so a lot of them will do
this, go straight into the

00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:33.710
configuration screen, which
isn't a bad idea.

00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:35.980
Except as you can see,
it's kind of a

00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:38.660
complicated options menu.

00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:40.410
There's a huge number
of options.

00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:42.450
There's some information
in there as well

00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:43.690
as some actual settings.

00:44:43.690 --> 00:44:46.625
There's Help, About, Contact Us,
little tech fields which

00:44:46.625 --> 00:44:48.330
just explain what
the app does.

00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:50.720
It becomes a little bit
overwhelming for

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:51.420
a first-time user.

00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:53.020
IAN NI-LEWIS: You know what it
feels like this needs more

00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:55.300
than anything is a tutorial.

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:56.270
RETO MEIER: Sure, yeah.

00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:58.040
IAN NI-LEWIS: It really does
need a little animated

00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:59.720
tutorial with little
Back and Next

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:01.950
buttons and a Skip button.

00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:02.680
RETO MEIER: Yes.

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:04.730
IAN NI-LEWIS: You know, little
pictures of fingers

00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:06.970
and things like that.

00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:09.100
Because you need to help
people understand.

00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:12.440
This is an incredibly useful
piece of functionality that a

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.860
lot of people are going to want,
especially people who

00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:16.960
are not particularly
computer literate.

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:18.980
So they may or may
not know where to

00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:20.150
find widgets in Android.

00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:22.570
But they certainly
know how to--

00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:24.450
they'll certainly know what
they want the app to do.

00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:24.700
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:26.740
IAN NI-LEWIS: And they just need
to be told how to do it.

00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:27.180
RETO MEIER: That's right.

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:30.680
And so what you can see on the
home screen here is the end

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:32.060
result of placing
these widgets.

00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:34.050
So you can see that
we've got a--

00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:35.400
we've got different-sized
widgets.

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:36.470
So this is a one by one.

00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:39.250
And we've got a two by
one here as well.

00:45:39.250 --> 00:45:39.680
If we click on--

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:40.960
IAN NI-LEWIS: So these aren't
resizable widgets?

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:43.050
RETO MEIER: They do have a
resizable one as well.

00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:44.930
So there's a third option, which
I actually thought I'd

00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:48.240
dropped on here, but maybe I
hadn't, which lets you do a

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:49.170
resizable one.

00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:53.260
In fact, we can bring it
up on widgets here.

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:55.090
IAN NI-LEWIS: I just smelled
another business opportunity.

00:45:55.090 --> 00:45:57.840
I could do home screen launcher
widgets like this and

00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:59.530
go full metro.

00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:00.470
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:02.340
So you can see here actually,
so this is the four by one,

00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:04.340
which is actually resizable.

00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:07.450
And you can see, again, this
is the configuration screen

00:46:07.450 --> 00:46:09.230
for each of the widgets.

00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:12.360
Now, straightaway, the
UI is a little--

00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:13.840
it could use a little
work, let's say.

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:15.760
It looks kind of gingerbready.

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:17.350
It's got the black theme,
which I think in this

00:46:17.350 --> 00:46:18.560
instance, doesn't really work.

00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:20.970
Because you've kind of-- it just
feels like it's blending

00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:21.750
into the background.

00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:22.720
Because it is--

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:24.160
and it isn't full
screen either.

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:26.680
And I can kind of see why they
haven't gone full screen.

00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:28.970
Because they want it
to look like it's a

00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:30.060
configuration dialog.

00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:32.400
But I think in this instance,
you could actually benefit

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:35.040
from actually launching a full
activity, which just, you go

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:39.660
into, you set things up, you hit
save, or OK, or whatever,

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:42.150
and your configuration
is complete.

00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:45.300
IAN NI-LEWIS: And even if you
are going to do a full screen

00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:49.330
or not full-screen dialog, it
should be prettier than this.

00:46:49.330 --> 00:46:51.100
You know, part of this
is on us, right?

00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:55.640
Orange on black was cool for
like five months back in 2010.

00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:56.800
RETO MEIER: So it's claimed.

00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:58.060
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's over.

00:46:58.060 --> 00:46:58.990
Yeah.

00:46:58.990 --> 00:47:00.110
RETO MEIER: We all
like blue now.

00:47:00.110 --> 00:47:00.650
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:01.720
RETO MEIER: And you
can see, I mean--

00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:03.540
IAN NI-LEWIS: We liked blue
before, actually, too.

00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:03.960
RETO MEIER: That's true.

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:04.920
IAN NI-LEWIS: Nobody
likes orange.

00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:05.860
RETO MEIER: No one
likes orange.

00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:08.300
You can see straightaway why
this kind of creates issues.

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:10.840
Straightaway, it looks
kind of weird.

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:12.580
And then if I click this-- so
they've done the right thing

00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:15.970
here in that it does launch the
contact picker to let you

00:47:15.970 --> 00:47:18.890
choose which contact you
want to include.

00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:20.105
But this is all Holo themed.

00:47:20.105 --> 00:47:21.350
IAN NI-LEWIS: I love how
Reto has two friends.

00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:23.060
RETO MEIER: Well, this
is Daniel's phone.

00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:26.520
One of Daniel's friends
is Daniel.

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:27.910
Awkward.

00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:30.750
So you can get this cognitive
dissonance of like, well, I'm

00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:32.620
definitely not in the
same app anymore.

00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:34.570
So I don't know what's
going on here.

00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:36.320
But if you click
through, then--

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:40.770
and again, you're bringing up
this kind of weird non-Holo,

00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:42.500
non-modern UI.

00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:43.960
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's a really
strange mix of styles.

00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:44.420
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:46.870
So you really want to try and
find a way to use the default

00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:49.980
themes so that you're keeping
up with whatever style is

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:51.170
prevalent at the time on

00:47:51.170 --> 00:47:53.430
whichever device it's installed.

00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:54.990
IAN NI-LEWIS: It also
feels like this just

00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:57.280
could use more graphics.

00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:00.240
It could use something that's
sort of explanatory, like--

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:04.460
I would even imagine maybe a
little view pager or something

00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:08.570
that chooses different types of
widgets with graphics that

00:48:08.570 --> 00:48:10.760
represent each of them.

00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:11.780
RETO MEIER: The thing that
you're going to want to do.

00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:13.075
Maybe even have a bunch
of presets.

00:48:13.075 --> 00:48:14.440
That could be interesting.

00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:16.270
There are certain use
cases which you've

00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:17.120
probably got in mind.

00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:19.960
And whether or not anyone will
ever actually use them, it

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:22.070
gives you that, like-- because
this is the first screen

00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:23.060
you're going to see,
basically, when

00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:23.670
you open this app.

00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:26.040
If you know how widgets work,
you're not going to click the

00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:26.590
launcher icon.

00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:28.400
You're just going to go
Add Widget, drop your

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:29.670
two by one on there.

00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:31.120
And this is the screen
you're going to get.

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:33.940
So this really needs to welcome
users, tell them what

00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:35.890
the app does, how they're
supposed to use it, which

00:48:35.890 --> 00:48:39.260
check box they're supposed to
have checked by default, and

00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:40.720
make it as simple as possible.

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:41.730
IAN NI-LEWIS: I have
to reemphasize

00:48:41.730 --> 00:48:42.710
what you just said.

00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:46.660
Widgets should have presets, and
this one, in particular.

00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:51.300
I mean, I think you'd cover 99%
of all possible cases for

00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:54.930
this widget by just providing
five or 10 presets.

00:48:54.930 --> 00:48:55.580
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:57.120
From here, basically
everything works

00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:58.150
as you would expect.

00:48:58.150 --> 00:49:00.840
If you hit any of these
problems, it brings up a

00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:02.690
confirmation dialog,
which you can skip.

00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:04.100
So you can say, you know what?

00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:07.340
If I want to send an emergency
message, I don't want to have

00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:08.070
to do two clicks.

00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:09.260
I just want to do one.

00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:10.090
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, and
once again, this

00:49:10.090 --> 00:49:12.840
is a confusing dialogue.

00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:14.710
I've just gone out of something
that's beautiful,

00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:17.060
which is the Android home screen
with the very nice

00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:20.410
widget, and now I'm looking
at this thing that--

00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:24.240
it almost looks like, oops,
some pirated app just took

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:25.275
over my screen.

00:49:25.275 --> 00:49:25.530
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:49:25.530 --> 00:49:27.080
And so you want this to
be small as well.

00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:29.070
We've got a whole bunch
of empty space here.

00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:32.230
So if you're not going full
screen, go as small as you can

00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:34.520
and make this-- it is just
a confirmation dialog.

00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:36.490
I've already selected
all this stuff.

00:49:36.490 --> 00:49:39.500
So you almost want to be able to
have a big Send button and

00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:41.740
then maybe an ability to edit
as well if you want to.

00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:42.080
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:43.470
You want the Send button
to be big.

00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:46.090
You want the information to be
there, but not editable.

00:49:46.090 --> 00:49:48.780
Then you want to have
a way to go edit it.

00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:52.890
Because by bringing up the edit
boxes as it is now, A,

00:49:52.890 --> 00:49:54.820
you're introducing possible
error, where somebody

00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:57.790
accidentally hits a key that
they didn't intend to.

00:49:57.790 --> 00:50:01.420
And B, you're making it seem
like I have to edit it, like

00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:03.200
that's my job now
is to edit this.

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:06.740
But no, I'm just trying to tell
Lassie where to dig to

00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:08.035
get me out from underneath
the rubble.

00:50:08.035 --> 00:50:08.810
RETO MEIER: Precisely.

00:50:08.810 --> 00:50:10.670
IAN NI-LEWIS: I don't
need all this.

00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:13.360
RETO MEIER: And again, what
I really like here is this

00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:14.540
ability to set a timer.

00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:17.610
So you can say, set it five
minutes into the future.

00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:18.560
IAN NI-LEWIS: That would be
great if they had used the new

00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:19.590
control for that, though.

00:50:19.590 --> 00:50:20.230
RETO MEIER: It kind of would.

00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:21.970
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's
intensely horrible.

00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:22.270
RETO MEIER: It is.

00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:24.700
And it's a really useful
function, so I would actually

00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:27.480
want to have that as
the main thing.

00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:30.080
So the two main things here are
I want send it now, send

00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:32.870
in a few minutes, and
edit also, maybe.

00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:35.510
So you almost want to flip the
importance of those things, so

00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:38.410
that the editing functionality
is up on the top right, and

00:50:38.410 --> 00:50:40.930
the being able to set a
timer is right there.

00:50:40.930 --> 00:50:43.750
Also note that there's no way to
cancel here as well, which

00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:44.760
is interesting.

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:46.770
So I'm done, but I
changed my mind.

00:50:46.770 --> 00:50:47.570
Do I just want to send it now?

00:50:47.570 --> 00:50:49.550
I kind of can't, which
is again--

00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:50.850
it's just that user flow.

00:50:50.850 --> 00:50:53.590
You want to make everything as
simple and easy as possible,

00:50:53.590 --> 00:50:55.500
and make it impossible for
a user to do it wrong.

00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:57.190
It's never the right answer
to say, oh, you're

00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:58.940
using the app wrong.

00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:00.500
That should never even
be an option.

00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:02.510
They should only ever be
able to use it right.

00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:04.780
One thing that they have done
nicely here is that one of the

00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:07.566
recipients you can set is, share
with other app, which is

00:51:07.566 --> 00:51:08.340
what we've got ticked now.

00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:12.690
So if we do that, we can see
it's set up an ongoing

00:51:12.690 --> 00:51:15.470
notification, which is--

00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:16.460
time is set to an hour.

00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:17.100
Interesting.

00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:19.080
I'm going to cancel that
one and set off

00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:22.280
another one really quickly.

00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:25.530
Now, what it's going to do is
find my current location.

00:51:25.530 --> 00:51:27.780
So now, all that information
we have it earlier on about

00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:29.720
being able to find a location
really quickly

00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:31.030
becomes really important.

00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:33.650
Because I don't want to sit here
waiting for it to find my

00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:35.050
GPS signal.

00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:36.860
Anything is good enough
right now.

00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:38.760
So you can by all means check
to see whether you can get

00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:39.800
something really accurate.

00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:41.970
If it doesn't happen within
5 seconds, screw it.

00:51:41.970 --> 00:51:43.920
Go with what you had
last and send that.

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:45.040
Maybe send a second message.

00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:46.410
Maybe make that an option.

00:51:46.410 --> 00:51:49.155
So that's going to keep doing
its thing, retrieving current

00:51:49.155 --> 00:51:51.660
location, for a while.

00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:54.860
Interestingly, the app comes up
when that happens as well.

00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:56.680
So I think you've probably done
something weird with your

00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:58.500
intent receivers there.

00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:00.050
So this shouldn't be getting
triggered from

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:00.810
clicking on the widget.

00:52:00.810 --> 00:52:02.900
That's not a great
user experience.

00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:04.780
So you want to make sure that
doesn't end up on the activity

00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:07.490
stack associated with your
activity when you're entering

00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:09.540
it from the widget.

00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:12.010
So once that's happened, it
will actually then let you

00:52:12.010 --> 00:52:14.460
send that message via any of the
other apps that you've got

00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:18.640
on the system, which is a nice
way of doing things.

00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:21.440
And in fact, I guess, maybe take
that as an opportunity to

00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:23.010
talk a little bit about
exactly what

00:52:23.010 --> 00:52:26.110
they're doing there.

00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:28.620
Oh, there it is.

00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:29.710
It's now got the location.

00:52:29.710 --> 00:52:32.010
And we can share it using any of
the apps which are capable

00:52:32.010 --> 00:52:33.790
of sharing text,
which is nice.

00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:41.940
As we were saying, perhaps even
more so than Foursquare,

00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:44.560
low-latency location detection
is absolutely

00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:46.090
critical for this app.

00:52:46.090 --> 00:52:47.740
So I'd be interested to know
from the developers what

00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:49.940
techniques they're using to get
that quick and accurate

00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:52.920
location fix, particularly
because it's not that quick.

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:55.320
So I'd like to see them doing
some work to improve that.

00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:58.810
But one of the things they have
done well is this sharing

00:52:58.810 --> 00:53:01.420
using any app dialog, which I
really like, and which is

00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:04.000
something that TripIt has done
pretty well as well, making

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.060
use of intents to add more
functionality to their apps

00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:10.230
without having to do
any extra work.

00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:11.010
IAN NI-LEWIS: We're running
out of time.

00:53:11.010 --> 00:53:14.060
But let's quickly go over what
you'd need to do to add the

00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:15.500
sort of share intent
to your app.

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:17.360
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:19.630
Let's see.

00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:22.352
So the details for what I'm
describing here are all on

00:53:22.352 --> 00:53:24.700
this Android training class
on sharing content.

00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:27.520
But the basics are actually
pretty straightforward.

00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:28.680
You can create--

00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:30.170
IAN NI-LEWIS: You know, all that
typography looked right

00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:30.960
on my laptop.

00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:32.250
RETO MEIER: That's
they all say.

00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:32.760
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yes, I know.

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:34.820
RETO MEIER: It was fine
on my machine.

00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:36.410
So you create a new intent.

00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:39.760
You set the action to send and
then populate the text extra

00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:41.490
with the text you want
to transmit.

00:53:41.490 --> 00:53:43.870
Then you just start an activity
using that intent.

00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:47.940
Now, in this example here, I'm
actually forcing the activity

00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:50.170
chooser to be displayed
every time.

00:53:50.170 --> 00:53:53.800
That's because users will often
choose a default app for

00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:55.410
handling a lot of content.

00:53:55.410 --> 00:53:58.930
And for an app like this, you
actually want to give the user

00:53:58.930 --> 00:54:01.650
a chance to say, well, which
specific thing do you want?

00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:04.110
Because you've actually ticked
a box to say, send using

00:54:04.110 --> 00:54:04.590
another app.

00:54:04.590 --> 00:54:07.080
It kind of makes sense to give
them an opportunity to say

00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:10.250
which app that they want.

00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:12.880
So given that we are just about
out of time, I think

00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:15.840
happily, we're just onto the
prescriptions for each of the

00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:17.040
apps that we want to look at.

00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:19.890
So let me pop all of this behind
us, and we'll bring

00:54:19.890 --> 00:54:21.290
each of these up.

00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:22.610
So I think this is the--

00:54:22.610 --> 00:54:24.660
these are the prescriptions
for Foursquare.

00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:25.760
IAN NI-LEWIS: Indeed.

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:27.100
RETO MEIER: We didn't have a
lot because they've done a

00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:27.880
pretty good job.

00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:29.320
IAN NI-LEWIS: No, they
really have, yeah.

00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:30.000
RETO MEIER: I'm pretty
impressed.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.780
I mean, the Foursquare team have
spent a lot time really

00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:35.800
refining and honing their
app to try and make

00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:36.730
it as good as possible.

00:54:36.730 --> 00:54:38.620
They're really passionate about
creating a pure Android

00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:41.780
experience, something that is
really user friendly, that

00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:44.633
makes the phone work better,
that is always a positive and

00:54:44.633 --> 00:54:46.290
not a negative, so
hats off to them.

00:54:46.290 --> 00:54:46.740
IAN NI-LEWIS: Indeed.

00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:49.750
But as with any app that was
designed almost exclusively in

00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:53.050
the Bay Area, it simply assumes
too much about your

00:54:53.050 --> 00:54:53.740
network connection.

00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:57.760
It needs to be better offline
and also better during

00:54:57.760 --> 00:54:58.810
changing network conditions.

00:54:58.810 --> 00:55:00.870
RETO MEIER: And so for me, I
guess the key thing-- and I

00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:02.440
have brought this up with
the Foursquare team.

00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:05.230
And I know they have good
reasons for not doing this,

00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:07.100
but I'm going to mention it
anyway for anyone else who's

00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:10.030
doing an app which does
something similar, is support

00:55:10.030 --> 00:55:12.420
for being able to check
in when I'm offline.

00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:16.010
So in the Bay Area, going inside
ends up having better

00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:18.550
network access because everyone
has free Wi-Fi.

00:55:18.550 --> 00:55:22.270
Not the case in London, and A
lot of the good venues are all

00:55:22.270 --> 00:55:25.400
three stories underground so
that they don't get bombed in

00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:28.090
the Second World War, but it
also means they have really

00:55:28.090 --> 00:55:31.240
bad network coverage and no free
Wi-Fi, because nothing is

00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:32.560
free in London.

00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:35.570
So being able to check in, and
then just have all of that get

00:55:35.570 --> 00:55:37.980
cached in a queue that then will
check me into all these

00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:40.055
places once I do get network
access would be

00:55:40.055 --> 00:55:41.870
a really nice feature.

00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:43.230
So I'm going to take this
opportunity to ask the

00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:44.300
Foursquare guys to do that.

00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:44.640
IAN NI-LEWIS: I would
love that.

00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:45.660
RETO MEIER: Again.

00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:47.040
TripIt--

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:49.870
we had a couple more suggestions
for them.

00:55:49.870 --> 00:55:52.010
Again, this is an app
that we really love.

00:55:52.010 --> 00:55:54.450
And this is one of those apps
which does everything right in

00:55:54.450 --> 00:55:56.390
terms of the service
that it provides.

00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:59.290
Absolutely love it, totally
indispensable, would use it

00:55:59.290 --> 00:56:01.760
even if it was a terminal
prompt.

00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:04.280
So that means that a lot of
what we're actually saying

00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:06.050
here is-- in a way,
it's nit picky.

00:56:06.050 --> 00:56:08.270
But it's also something which
can make the app that much

00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:10.120
more appealing, that much
more fun to use.

00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:12.960
And I think the key thing here
is it would be great to see

00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:15.450
them take another pass at the
design, another pass at the

00:56:15.450 --> 00:56:19.530
UI, now that we've had these
changes to Holo, so kind of a

00:56:19.530 --> 00:56:23.430
UI overhaul would be kind
of nice to see.

00:56:23.430 --> 00:56:25.710
So we've got all the
details there--

00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:29.560
things like getting rid of the
menu button; not having to

00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:32.450
click to load more lists, just
having that automatically fill

00:56:32.450 --> 00:56:35.630
as we scroll; more use of
C2DM; better copying and

00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:38.150
pasting; and overall
cleaner navigation.

00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:42.440
And our third contender, the
Share Where location widget.

00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:45.530
Again, I think the key here is
really a simplified workflow.

00:56:45.530 --> 00:56:47.840
Everything should be easier,
particularly the first time.

00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:50.230
It should just be click,
click, that's my wife's

00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:52.200
contact, done.

00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:54.360
IAN NI-LEWIS: We have talked
about this many times, that a

00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:57.190
lot of apps are just difficult
to get into.

00:56:57.190 --> 00:56:59.370
And what you need do is just
figure out what the most

00:56:59.370 --> 00:57:01.270
common use case is,
and Just fill that

00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:02.710
stuff in for the user.

00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:03.640
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:05.440
It seems kind of
counterintuitive in a lot of

00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:08.400
ways to say, we want you to
remove some of the options

00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:09.410
from your app.

00:57:09.410 --> 00:57:11.390
But it kind of works,
particularly for something

00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:14.360
like this, which is really
focused, is figure out what is

00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:16.150
it that people are downloading
this app to do.

00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:18.730
And you can use analytics for
that to find out what are the

00:57:18.730 --> 00:57:20.280
most common settings that
they're choosing?

00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:22.610
What are the most common options
that they're clicking?

00:57:22.610 --> 00:57:25.340
And make that not only the
default, but maybe the only

00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:26.320
thing that you can do.

00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:29.040
And then worry about expanding
those features in a way that's

00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:31.180
consistent with the app usage
and easier to use

00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:31.940
as time goes on.

00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:33.840
IAN NI-LEWIS: And definitely
ditch the gingerbread.

00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:34.460
We're sorry.

00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:36.160
We're sorry we ever
put it out.

00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:36.740
Go to Holo.

00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:37.370
RETO MEIER: It happens.

00:57:37.370 --> 00:57:40.110
But yeah, make a UI that's
consistent with the rest of

00:57:40.110 --> 00:57:42.540
the framework, preferably
something that's Holo, but

00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:44.240
definitely something which
doesn't feel like it's been

00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:46.520
yanked out of an earlier
phone and stuck in the

00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:47.230
middle of your app.

00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:49.090
And that's, again, particularly
important for

00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:50.730
anything which is
widget-based.

00:57:50.730 --> 00:57:53.230
Because users aren't going
to be in your app much.

00:57:53.230 --> 00:57:56.460
But when they are, you don't
want to make it feel jarring.

00:57:56.460 --> 00:57:58.430
So that's kind of an
important step.

00:57:58.430 --> 00:58:00.710
And also the widget, the widget
is what you're doing.

00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:02.230
So make sure the widgets
are really beautiful.

00:58:02.230 --> 00:58:07.580
They look kind of jaggy and
blurred on the Galaxy Nexus.

00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:10.440
So make sure you've got the
right assets, nice scalable

00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:12.490
assets, so that everything
looks really beautiful.

00:58:12.490 --> 00:58:13.870
Because if it's going to live
on the home screen, it needs

00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:14.590
to look nice.

00:58:14.590 --> 00:58:17.370
People want their home
screens to look nice.

00:58:17.370 --> 00:58:23.650
So I think that just about takes
us to the end of today's

00:58:23.650 --> 00:58:28.140
"App Clinic." So two, both
Foursquare and TripIt of the

00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:29.940
apps that we looked at, are
already featured in Google

00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:32.020
Play's Editor's Choice category,
which makes them a

00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:33.990
good chance to join the pure
Android collection,

00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:36.920
particularly Foursquare, which,
having looked at again

00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:39.050
today, just continues
to impress.

00:58:39.050 --> 00:58:41.460
So wherever possible in the
future, we're going to

00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:43.370
prioritize reviewing
apps by people who

00:58:43.370 --> 00:58:45.400
self-nominated them.

00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:48.970
So to be sure, please be sure
to head over to Trello to

00:58:48.970 --> 00:58:50.000
nominate your apps.

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:53.100
And in fact I'll stick that
in the background as well.

00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:54.350
I don't know if you
can read that.

00:58:54.350 --> 00:58:55.440
I don't think that I can.

00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:56.030
IAN NI-LEWIS: You might want
to bring that to the

00:58:56.030 --> 00:58:56.750
foreground.

00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:57.570
RETO MEIER: Why not?

00:58:57.570 --> 00:58:59.510
Let's bring it to the front.

00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.670
Boom.

00:58:59.670 --> 00:59:00.330
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yes!

00:59:00.330 --> 00:59:03.720
RETO MEIER: So that's
bit.ly/appclinictrello.

00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:06.760
That's where you going to go
to nominate the categories

00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:08.760
that you'd like us to review and
to nominate your apps in

00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:12.110
particular for us to
take a look at.

00:59:12.110 --> 00:59:15.450
So next week, what are we
looking at next week?

00:59:15.450 --> 00:59:18.180
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, if I knew,
I'd be a genius.

00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:19.800
What are we looking
at next week, Dan?

00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:21.220
RETO MEIER: I'm going to read
off the screen and say--

00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:23.070
DAN: You guys are going
instant messenger.

00:59:23.070 --> 00:59:24.220
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, it's
on the screen.

00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:25.630
RETO MEIER: I wouldn't have
asked you if I hadn't given

00:59:25.630 --> 00:59:27.004
you the answer.

00:59:27.004 --> 00:59:27.790
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, dear.

00:59:27.790 --> 00:59:28.500
RETO MEIER: So we're going
to be choosing

00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:29.580
that later this afternoon.

00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:31.470
So if you have an instant
messaging app that you would

00:59:31.470 --> 00:59:34.430
like us to check out, please
make sure that you've got it

00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:37.690
nominated there so that we
can bring it up and talk

00:59:37.690 --> 00:59:39.280
about it next week.

00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:40.390
IAN NI-LEWIS: Indeed.

00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:43.580
So, instant messaging, should
we narrow that down at all?

00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:44.710
RETO MEIER: If you like.

00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:47.300
IAN NI-LEWIS: So these
are apps like

00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:48.820
Google Talk, or like--

00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:49.310
I don't know.

00:59:49.310 --> 00:59:52.010
Is AOL Instant Messenger
still a thing?

00:59:52.010 --> 00:59:53.730
Or like Skype--

00:59:53.730 --> 00:59:54.530
RETO MEIER: ICQ.

00:59:54.530 --> 00:59:55.170
IAN NI-LEWIS: ICQ, yeah.

00:59:55.170 --> 00:59:56.460
RETO MEIER: You're going
to go old school?

00:59:56.460 --> 00:59:56.830
IAN NI-LEWIS: Sure.

00:59:56.830 --> 01:00:01.130
So something that's going to
allow you to type and/or voice

01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:01.940
to each other.

01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:02.810
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

01:00:02.810 --> 01:00:05.060
IAN NI-LEWIS: I'm particularly
interested in looking at what

01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:06.690
they call the push-to-talk
apps.

01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:09.590
RETO MEIER: Absolutely So
that'll be interesting one, an

01:00:09.590 --> 01:00:11.670
interesting one to try and
demo the apps as well.

01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:13.080
So we may need to get
someone in another

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:14.200
room to help us out.

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:14.860
IAN NI-LEWIS: Indeed.

01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:16.610
Oh, that will be interesting.

01:00:16.610 --> 01:00:18.770
RETO MEIER: So that's it for
today's episode of "The App

01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:22.310
Clinic." But be sure to tune in
next Tuesday for "Android

01:00:22.310 --> 01:00:24.880
Design in Action" with Roman,
Nick, and Adam, live from our

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:25.570
New York studios.

01:00:25.570 --> 01:00:29.040
Now, before we sign off, I do
want to ask our producer Dan

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:32.440
if we have any questions which
we should answer in the

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:35.090
negative 13 seconds
that we have?

01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:37.490
DAN: I didn't see anything
that is worth your time.

01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:39.630
We just have the normal
quality YouTube

01:00:39.630 --> 01:00:41.330
comments going on.

01:00:41.330 --> 01:00:41.890
IAN NI-LEWIS: Awesome.

01:00:41.890 --> 01:00:43.120
DAN: Maybe better
luck next week.

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:44.290
IAN NI-LEWIS: Keep
it up, haters.

01:00:44.290 --> 01:00:47.300
RETO MEIER: So yeah, we would
love to answer any questions

01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:49.526
you guys have during the show
about the apps or about any of

01:00:49.526 --> 01:00:52.240
the technical content, or
indeed, just the structure of

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:54.380
the show, given that we're
trying things a little bit

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:54.780
differently.

01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:57.810
So do be sure to send your
comments through on Google+,

01:00:57.810 --> 01:00:58.722
in particular.

01:00:58.722 --> 01:01:00.600
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:03.650
If you happen to be looking at
this later on, remember, we've

01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:07.680
got comments open on Google+
that you can take a look at.

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:09.646
And all you need do is mention
one of our names, and we'll

01:01:09.646 --> 01:01:10.890
see it and look at it.

01:01:10.890 --> 01:01:11.900
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:13.970
So we'll be back again next
week at the same time.

01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:15.630
And in the meantime, we're going
to be taking a look at

01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:18.450
some of our past "App Clinic"
patients to see if any of them

01:01:18.450 --> 01:01:20.700
have attained the status
of pure Android.

01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:23.080
So if you have had your app
reviewed and you've made some

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.250
changes and you'd love for us
to take a look at those

01:01:25.250 --> 01:01:27.500
improvements, do let us know.

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:28.980
My name is Reto Meier.

01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:29.720
IAN NI-LEWIS: I'm
Ian Ni-Lewis.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:30.890
RETO MEIER: And thank
you for watching.

01:01:30.890 --> 01:01:32.140
IAN NI-LEWIS: Cheers.

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:44.133
