close to the edge in terms of falling
 

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:43.529
close to the edge in terms of falling
into poverty and we're just not having

into poverty and we're just not having
 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:45.599
into poverty and we're just not having
those conversations we're talking about

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:45.609
those conversations we're talking about
 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:49.229
those conversations we're talking about
things that matter but when we talk

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239
things that matter but when we talk
 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:50.790

about building a society where all

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800
about building a society where all
 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.149

talking about the issues that will make
 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:59.099
talking about the issues that will make
the difference for them we don't talk a

00:00:59.099 --> 00:00:59.109
the difference for them we don't talk a
 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.369
the difference for them we don't talk a
lot about white poverty and I think we

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379
lot about white poverty and I think we
 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:03.989
lot about white poverty and I think we
should because I think if we talked a

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:03.999
should because I think if we talked a
 

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:06.360
should because I think if we talked a
lot more about the way poverty impacts

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.370
lot more about the way poverty impacts
 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.209
lot more about the way poverty impacts

different groups I think we would not
 

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:12.330
different groups I think we would not
see it as an issue that's out there and

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340
see it as an issue that's out there and
 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.429
see it as an issue that's out there and
doesn't impact me or it's a black issue

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439
doesn't impact me or it's a black issue
 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:17.190
doesn't impact me or it's a black issue
or a Latino issue we would see it as an

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200
or a Latino issue we would see it as an
 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.679
or a Latino issue we would see it as an
issue of lack and people not having the

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689
issue of lack and people not having the
 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:24.330
issue of lack and people not having the
resources that they need to be able to

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340
resources that they need to be able to
 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.660
resources that they need to be able to
live the quality and productive life

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670
live the quality and productive life
 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.630
live the quality and productive life
what we know though is that black and

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640
what we know though is that black and
 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.550
what we know though is that black and
Latino people are more likely to live in

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560
Latino people are more likely to live in
 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.020
Latino people are more likely to live in
poverty and white people are also poor

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030
poverty and white people are also poor
 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.270
poverty and white people are also poor
but we're not again we're not talking

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280
but we're not again we're not talking
 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.679
but we're not again we're not talking
about those conversations and we're not

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689
about those conversations and we're not
 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:45.330
about those conversations and we're not
even writing about those conversations

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340
even writing about those conversations
 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.730
even writing about those conversations
so when we're not talking about rural

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740
so when we're not talking about rural
 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.739
so when we're not talking about rural
communities and rural White's

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:48.749
communities and rural White's
 

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:51.359
communities and rural White's
those people are invisible in media and

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369
those people are invisible in media and
 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.099
those people are invisible in media and
culture when we're talk about poverty

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:53.109
culture when we're talk about poverty
 

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:56.489
culture when we're talk about poverty
and so until we can really wrap our

00:01:56.489 --> 00:01:56.499
and so until we can really wrap our
 

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:59.669
and so until we can really wrap our
minds around the magnitude of who's

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679
minds around the magnitude of who's
 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:01.830
minds around the magnitude of who's
living in poverty and what poverty the

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840
living in poverty and what poverty the
 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.300
living in poverty and what poverty the
face of poverty and what it really looks

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310
face of poverty and what it really looks
 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.620
face of poverty and what it really looks
like we're not really going to be able

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630
like we're not really going to be able
 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.400
like we're not really going to be able
to make policies that will reach the

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410
to make policies that will reach the
 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.080
to make policies that will reach the
people who are really impact

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090
people who are really impact
 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.869
people who are really impact
are affected by it one of the things I

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879
are affected by it one of the things I
 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:14.820
are affected by it one of the things I
think is unique about American poverty

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830
think is unique about American poverty
 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.040
think is unique about American poverty
is the gap between the wealthiest and

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050
is the gap between the wealthiest and
 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.720
is the gap between the wealthiest and
the poorest in our society and that gap

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730
the poorest in our society and that gap
 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.449
the poorest in our society and that gap
continues to widen and there are no

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459
continues to widen and there are no
 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.059
continues to widen and there are no
efforts to close the gap to make sure

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069
efforts to close the gap to make sure
 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.460
efforts to close the gap to make sure
that the people at the the bottom of the

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470
that the people at the the bottom of the
 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.589
that the people at the the bottom of the
economic ladder have the resources and

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599
economic ladder have the resources and
 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.570
economic ladder have the resources and
they need to just have a basic standard

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580
they need to just have a basic standard
 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.150
they need to just have a basic standard
of living there are no efforts so for

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160
of living there are no efforts so for
 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.059
of living there are no efforts so for
example you can work 40 hours a week get

example you can work 40 hours a week get
 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.930
example you can work 40 hours a week get
up every day go to work and still need

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940
up every day go to work and still need
 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.820
up every day go to work and still need
other resources and supports to be able

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830
other resources and supports to be able
 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:42.569
other resources and supports to be able
to make ends meet

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579
to make ends meet
 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.190
to make ends meet
whether that's housing whether that's

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200
whether that's housing whether that's
 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.500
whether that's housing whether that's
Food Stamp whether that's medical

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510
Food Stamp whether that's medical
 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.390
Food Stamp whether that's medical
insurance and that shouldn't be the case

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400
insurance and that shouldn't be the case
 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.509
insurance and that shouldn't be the case
here I think that we really need to pay

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519
here I think that we really need to pay
 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.160
here I think that we really need to pay
attention to what's happening to the

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170
attention to what's happening to the
 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.410
attention to what's happening to the
most vulnerable and the fragile middle

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420
most vulnerable and the fragile middle
 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.580
most vulnerable and the fragile middle
class who are sometimes a paycheck away

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590
class who are sometimes a paycheck away
 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.150
class who are sometimes a paycheck away
from living in poverty or being in

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160
from living in poverty or being in
 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.069
from living in poverty or being in
poverty themselves what frightens me is

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079
poverty themselves what frightens me is
 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.710
poverty themselves what frightens me is
that there's not enough more

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720
that there's not enough more
 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.280
that there's not enough more
responsibility for others in our society

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290
responsibility for others in our society
 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.030
responsibility for others in our society
and so we can just turn our back we can

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040
and so we can just turn our back we can
 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.800
and so we can just turn our back we can
say hey that's not me that doesn't

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810
say hey that's not me that doesn't
 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.870
say hey that's not me that doesn't
impact me or that's happening to them

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.849
impact me or that's happening to them
and not to me and not seeing the

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859
and not to me and not seeing the
 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:26.220
and not to me and not seeing the
connection between us all if I support

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230
connection between us all if I support
 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.900
connection between us all if I support
programs that make sure that the the

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910
programs that make sure that the the
 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.059
programs that make sure that the the
most vulnerable in our society have what

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069
most vulnerable in our society have what
 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.670
most vulnerable in our society have what
they need to have a basic standard of

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680
they need to have a basic standard of
 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.140
they need to have a basic standard of
living that somehow takes away from me

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150
living that somehow takes away from me
 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.610
living that somehow takes away from me
if we can get away from that idea and

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620
if we can get away from that idea and
 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.349
if we can get away from that idea and
that sort of thinking then I think we'll

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359
that sort of thinking then I think we'll
 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:42.360
that sort of thinking then I think we'll
be able to get to a place where we can

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370
be able to get to a place where we can
 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.789
be able to get to a place where we can
say this is not an us then problem it's

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799
say this is not an us then problem it's
 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.470
say this is not an us then problem it's
a problem that we all need to be working

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480
a problem that we all need to be working
 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.290
a problem that we all need to be working
together to solve
