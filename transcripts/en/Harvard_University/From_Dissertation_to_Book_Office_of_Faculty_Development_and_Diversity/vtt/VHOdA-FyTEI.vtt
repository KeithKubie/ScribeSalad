JUDY SINGER: I'm Judy Singer.

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:02.970
I'm the Senior Vice Provost
for Faculty Development

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:03.553
and Diversity.

00:00:03.553 --> 00:00:07.850
And I want to welcome you all to
this event on book publishing.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.980
We have a great panel here,
both from the publishing end

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.120
and from the
faculty end, to help

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.230
provide insights in how
you go from having written

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.640
a dissertation, which I
presume everybody in this room

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.690
has done, and writing a book.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.980
Some of the people
who are here are

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.449
people who have historically
been book people.

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.490
In other words, when you
wrote your dissertation,

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.330
you actually thought about
framing it in terms of a book.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.590
Others are making a transition
from having written more

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.520
on the paper side,
and are thinking

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.170
about how you could convert
those ideas into a book length

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.160
manuscript.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.530
I've written three books.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.240
I fall in the second camp.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.240
I'm a statistician, so I'm
primarily a paper person.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.270
But the task of writing
a book is a daunting one.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.530
There's something about being a
faculty member where everybody

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.880
assumes that somehow, when you
turned in your dissertation

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.950
and you got the sign off from
your advisor and other people

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.370
on your committee, you
magically knew everything

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.290
that you needed to know
about academic publishing.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.740
And I think one of the things
you're going to hear today

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.820
is, that's not the case.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.200
And so, for those of you who
are in the midst of writing,

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.970
I think you're probably
confronting that spot on.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.970
And we hope that this
gives you an opportunity

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.340
to learn from a
distinguished panel about how

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.189
to take those next steps.

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.730
To introduce the
panelists, I'm going

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.438
to introduce my
colleague, Amy Brand, who

00:01:29.438 --> 00:01:31.740
is the Assistant Provost
for Faculty Appointments.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.420
Thank you.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.570
AMY BRAND: Good
afternoon and welcome.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.940
First and foremost, I just
want to say that I'm really

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.060
delighted to have this
panel and, also, to have--

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.029
I think for the first
time in our events

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:54.695
within the office of
faculty development

00:01:54.695 --> 00:02:01.790
and diversity-- some colleagues
from MIT as well, which

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.910
is my alma mater.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.700
We have very limited
time, and we really

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.450
want to encourage discussion.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.080
So you'll notice that we
have the panel being filmed,

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.820
but when it comes to the
time of asking questions

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.280
during the Q&amp;A, we're
going to turn that off.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.820
So feel free to
ask any questions

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.140
you like of the panel.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.320
In the handouts, you'll
see that we've put

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.070
in bios of all of our speakers.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.850
So, rather than give lengthy
introductions, which they all

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.540
do deserve, I will start
with Elizabeth Knoll who's

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.110
Senior Editor for the behavioral
sciences, education, and law

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.389
at Harvard University Press.

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:43.930
ELIZABETH KNOLL:
I'm going to start--

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.304
and I hope you can hear me--
by talking about how to turn

00:02:46.304 --> 00:02:48.610
your dissertation into a book.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.280
Generations of
dissertation writers

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.620
have been paralyzed,
at least for a while,

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.580
by the philosopher Moore's
comment at Wittgenstein's

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.100
dissertation defense, "It is
my opinion that Mr. Ludwig

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.910
Wittgenstein's Tractatus
Logico-Philosophicus is

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.920
a work of genius that
will completely change

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.000
all future work and philosophy.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.180
But be that as it
may, it is well up

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.820
to the standards of a
Cambridge PhD degree."

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.550
Probably no one said this
about your dissertation.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.510
But there is an
immense liberation

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.630
in realizing that you are
probably not a genius, at least

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.940
not yet, and that your
dissertation doesn't

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.300
have to show that you
are-- or change the world.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.880
A dissertation, as a
rule, is a demonstration

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.640
of professional competence.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.770
It shows that you have mastered
the literature in your field,

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.530
that you can do
research according

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.280
to the standards
of your discipline,

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.660
and that you can make a
persuasive and well-supported

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.760
argument, at least to that
very essential audience,

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.030
your committee.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.090
A handful of senior faculty
advisors, here and there,

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.370
and some academic
programs now encourage

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.950
people to write their
dissertations as books from the

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.459
get go.

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.000
But for the most
part, a dissertation

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.450
is quite a different
creature from a book.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.550
So how do you turn the
one into the other?

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.340
The answer is threefold.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.030
At the most obvious and basic
level, there are the mechanics.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.550
More deeply, there's
the authorial voice.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.720
And finally, perhaps
least obviously--

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.300
but I think most
fundamentally-- there's manners.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.490
And I don't just mean by
manners addressing people

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:22.660
by the correct name
or not insulting them,

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.500
though that's
certainly important.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.050
I mean the kind of
manners that makes

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.890
a conversation a real
conversation and not just

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.800
alternating monologues.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.960
Good manners means recognizing
another person's position,

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.110
constraints, and feelings
and caring enough about them

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.660
and respecting them so
that you don't ignore them.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.300
In the case of book writing,
the obvious first people

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.220
you need to consider are your
editor and the reviewers.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.370
But the really important other
people to be thought about

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.640
are your eventual readers.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.940
So let me start with the easiest
part, which is the mechanics.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.090
Most editors will tell
you just about everything

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.790
I'm going to say, and I
owe a lot of this talk

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.250
to some notes given by Kathleen
McDermott, the Senior Editor

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.170
of Harvard Press in history.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.990
First of all-- get
out your pencils-- aim

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.440
for a final manuscript
of about 100,000 words

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.570
and absolutely not
more than 120,000 words

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.540
all inclusive, meaning
including the notes.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.590
Now, assuming 335 words
per page in a 12 point font

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.320
with 1 inch margins,
100,000 words

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.520
is about 300 manuscript pages.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.200
Second, keep the manuscript
as sleek as possible.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.630
Limit the apparatus-- the
tables, the chart, the figures,

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.320
all illustrations.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.270
The more illustrations you
have and the more complicated

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.880
they are, the less
appealing the manuscript

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.760
may be to a publisher.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.110
Now many people wonder
why this is true,

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.410
if art-- that is,
black and white art--

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:55.480
is not more expensive
to print than text.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.970
The answer is that
art is a complication,

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.770
and complication is
always expensive in terms

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.940
of people's time, your
own and the publisher's.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.780
Art has to be a
publishable quality.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.090
It has to be the right size.

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.930
All the permissions for the
art that you don't own yourself

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.340
have to be sought, granted,
and paid for by you.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.070
All legends have to be supplied
and unambiguously linked

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.560
to the correct piece of art.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:27.100
And everything has to come
in together and on time.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.939
I think you can probably see why
this can create complications.

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:34.230
Then there are the elements
in the text that you should

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:38.010
reduce or remove completely.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.620
The first, the
literature review.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.010
Discussions of
other author's work

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:48.030
need to be integrated with
your argument or in the notes.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.960
Second, the use
of other author's

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.190
characterizations of
problems or events or ideas.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.440
Speak in your own voice.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.350
Third, limit quotations.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:02.040
Often quotations
are used to allow

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.370
you to invoke an authority.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.890
Use only quotations
that say something

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:11.570
in a memorably pungent
or eloquent or funny way.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:12.550
And keep them short.

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.690
Use quotations to vary
the voice in the text.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.480
Limit the number of notes,
especially the discursive

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.820
notes.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.030
I have an author right
now whose manuscript

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:31.010
is 103,000 words of text,
which is basically fine,

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:36.200
and 89,000 words of notes,
which is a lot less fine.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.710
This is not a model
that you should follow.

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:40.590
And I'm not allowing
him to either,

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:42.810
but it's very painful
for him to have

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:47.410
to cut his 90,000 words of notes
down to approximately 10,000

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:50.110
or 15,000.

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:54.400
Avoid chapter opening
abstracts and chapter summaries

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:59.390
that essentially repeat the
chapter opening abstracts.

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:03.120
And you know who you are.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:09.140
In this chapter, I will
discuss the nautical and legal

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.580
maneuvering that
led to the Norman

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:17.630
conquest between the
years of 1025 and 1035.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:21.110
I will show A, B, and C. And
then at the end of the chapter,

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:22.320
you say the same thing.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.140
Please don't do this.

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:27.950
Try to avoid using
a lot of subheads

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.430
and a lot of subdivisions
within chapters.

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:36.130
Let the chapters flow as
a continuous statement

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:38.750
and a continuous argument.

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.780
Avoid using subtitles in the
chapter titles or quotations

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:44.270
in chapter titles.

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:46.942
They often just get too
long and hard to read.

00:08:46.942 --> 00:08:49.400
And try to make sure that all
the chapters are more or less

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.740
the same length.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.200
Avoid the extremes of many short
chapters or a few very long

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.370
chapters.

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:58.440
15 typed pages is
probably too short.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.180
70 typed pages is
probably too long.

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:04.937
I have a manuscript
right now of about-- it's

00:09:04.937 --> 00:09:05.770
a reasonable length.

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:08.100
But it has only four
chapters, and each chapter

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.760
is 75 pages long.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.059
It's un-digestible.

00:09:13.059 --> 00:09:14.600
One can at least
see what it's about,

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.170
but it's very hard for readers
to sort of make their way

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.680
through chapters that long.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.870
Now these are some of
the most essential, basic

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.610
mechanical changes.

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.360
As you revise and
rewrite though,

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.110
you'll need to mull
over matters that

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:29.730
are more ambiguous
and more arguable

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:31.690
and that are more of a
judgement call, which

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:35.260
gets us to the questions
of voice and style.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:40.060
Now editors like me will always,
always, always say, avoid

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.820
jargon and insider lingo.

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:46.880
The line between jargon
and a technical term

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.470
with precise and useful
meaning for people in the field

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:53.710
is, admittedly, a
hard one to draw.

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:55.630
What is jargon?

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:58.230
It can follow Justice
Potter Stewart's famous line

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:01.970
on pornography, "I
know it when I see it."

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:05.400
More often though with jargon,
it's more likely to be the case

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.700
that your friends know
it when they hear it.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:13.160
If they can't understand
a chapter or a passage

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.710
or worse, if they start to
laugh when you read some of it

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:21.030
aloud to them, you might want
to think about rewriting.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:24.150
A highly theatrical editor whom
I used to work with sometimes

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:27.350
tells his postdocs,
"Take your work home

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.260
and read it to your husband.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.170
Read it to your dog.

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:33.260
That will help you turn
this manuscript, which

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:37.650
is 28,000 times too long,
into something neat and crisp

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:40.080
and what people
would want to read."

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.020
If you absolutely need
the insider language,

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:46.000
and you don't want to
unpack it or explain it,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.420
then keep it, and be prepared
to make the case for it.

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.330
But bear in mind that that
will come with a cost.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.470
Insider language may
mean-- almost certainly

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:58.060
will mean-- a smaller
market for your book.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:01.760
And that may limit the eventual
publisher's enthusiasm,

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.450
or at least the degree of
enthusiasm for the book.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:10.000
Take some thought with
your table of contents.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.310
Remember that it will
be the very first thing

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:15.640
that any reader sees
after the title page.

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.670
Susan Boehmer, who's the Editor
in Chief at Harvard Press,

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:22.100
says that a table of
contents should be a poem.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:26.540
Now poetry may be asking a
lot, but your table of contents

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.730
can be clear,
immediately digestible,

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:32.880
and it will outline the
book's argument and scope.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.520
It should fit on one
page, and a reader,

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:40.900
in scanning it should be able
to see what this book is about.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:44.770
Write a real introduction
and a real conclusion.

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:50.410
In the introduction, say what
is the book's central argument.

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.830
What is it contributing
to the field?

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.650
What important
puzzle is it solving?

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:58.790
What previously unknown
story is it telling?

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:02.400
What piece of conventional
wisdom are you overturning?

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:06.690
And in the conclusion, tell
us what the consequence is.

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:09.520
What difference does it
make if you're right?

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.470
How might your argument,
or your discovery,

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:15.020
or your approach
help make more sense

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:18.440
to some other current
significant work or problems

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.525
in your field?

00:12:20.525 --> 00:12:22.900
These questions about the
introduction and the conclusion

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:24.733
take us to the big
picture of the difference

00:12:24.733 --> 00:12:27.050
between a dissertation
in a book and why I make

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:29.920
a point of emphasizing manners.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.679
A dissertation is an exercise.

00:12:32.679 --> 00:12:34.970
Part of the reason writing
a dissertation can sometimes

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:37.440
be so painful is
that, on one hand,

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.000
it matters so much to
your academic progress

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.350
and your career, and
on the other hand,

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:46.420
it matters not at all
to the wider world.

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:50.520
You probably already know
this from Thanksgiving,

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.240
when your aunt Debbie asked
you to explain, again,

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:58.070
exactly what it is you do.

00:12:58.070 --> 00:12:59.990
In fact-- and this is
an important point--

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:03.840
the larger world is so
wary of dissertations

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.520
that you should scrub the
very word dissertation

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.830
from the final manuscript that
you turn into the publisher,

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:13.660
because some library
wholesalers will not

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.420
buy any books that
can be recognized

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.240
as revised dissertations.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.160
But a book is different
from a dissertation,

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.360
and it's much, much
more satisfying to read

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:25.890
and to write.

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:29.160
With a dissertation, you
have something to prove.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.140
With a book, you have
something to say.

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:36.030
The purpose of a dissertation
might be, in part--

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:39.480
realistically-- to
show how much you know.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.070
The purpose of a book
is to make an argument

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:45.950
and join or create
a conversation.

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:47.830
As a potential book
author, you already

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:50.570
have some academic authority.

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:52.690
You have that PhD.

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:55.820
You're at Harvard, which
is a name to conjure with.

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:59.380
You have given conference talks,
and you published articles.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.400
Your purpose now is
not to prove yourself

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.780
so much as it is to prove
your case to the people who

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.400
care about it.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.370
That will probably not be
a huge group of people.

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:12.990
Just as your dissertation is
probably not the Tractatus,

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:14.850
your first book is
probably not going

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:18.640
to win a Pulitzer Prize,
unlike, say, Paul Starr's Social

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.130
Transformation of
American Medicine.

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:23.510
That's probably just as
well, because what would you

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:25.730
do for an encore in
your second book?

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:29.420
You need to have something to
strive for after you're 30.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:31.290
But you do want
your book to be read

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:33.070
and to be readable
by all the people who

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:34.990
care about what you care about.

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:38.380
That's why editors will plead
with you to keep it short,

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:42.140
make it clear, omit
the unnecessary words.

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:45.500
What editors are really doing
is asking you to put yourself

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.330
in your reader's place.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:50.260
Think about them as real people.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.920
They probably are real people.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:56.060
In fact, you probably
already know some of them.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.590
They will be, in
the grand scheme

00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:01.190
of things, people who
are a lot like you.

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:04.830
Busy, intermittently impatient,
with their own interests

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:08.040
and their own turf to defend,
but essentially curious,

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:11.750
intelligent, imaginative,
and as impassioned as you

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:13.037
are about the subject.

00:15:13.037 --> 00:15:15.620
Otherwise, they wouldn't read a
review of your book, let alone

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.470
the book itself.

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:21.890
But life is short, and attention
spans are getting shorter.

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:26.720
The secret truth, which I
hereby reveal free of charge,

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.700
is that even the senior
people in your field

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.930
would rather not read more
pages of jargon laden academic

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:34.900
writing than they have to.

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.372
They've already read
quite a lot of it.

00:15:37.372 --> 00:15:39.580
What they and other people
in your world want to know

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.690
is what you have to say,
how you're backing it up,

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:44.340
and why it matters.

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:46.760
And they want you to say
it as strongly but also as

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.670
straightforwardly as you can.

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:52.200
Here's a story that
I think is helpful.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.840
The great physicist
Murray Gell-Mann

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:58.140
is famous for knowing not
just everything about physics,

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:00.430
but everything else, too.

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:03.820
He always pronounces the
names of people in places

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:08.200
as native speakers of the
languages would or should.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.180
In fact, he has been said
to correct native Ukrainians

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.180
on their pronunciation
of Ukrainian.

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:17.030
There is a story that he
once told Richard Feynman,

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:20.810
also a great physicist-- a
colleague of his at Caltech--

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:24.850
that he had just returned
from "Moe-rhay-ah."

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:27.490
When Feynman finally
established that Gell-Mann

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:31.560
meant the city known to most
English speakers as Montreal,

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.300
he said, "Hey, Murray.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:38.580
Do you believe that the purpose
of language is communication?"

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.130
It's a kind of
parlor game to argue

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:42.620
about who is the greater
physicist, Feynman

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.930
or Gell-Mann, and it's almost
certainly a silly question.

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:47.650
But every editor
and most readers

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:51.200
would put an extra couple of
flowers on Feynman's grave.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.990
The purpose of language
is communication.

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:57.860
The purpose of your book
is to talk to other people.

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.170
And now, Phil will
tell you about talking

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:03.100
to the first round of
other people, which

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:05.869
is the publishers.

00:17:05.869 --> 00:17:07.400
PHIL: Thank you.
