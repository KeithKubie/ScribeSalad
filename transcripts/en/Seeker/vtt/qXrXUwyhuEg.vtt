00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.699
The placebo effect is so weird.

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:04.420
How does the power of placebo work?

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:05.710
Is it all in your head?

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.219
Well new research suggests it might all be
in your genes.

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.369
Hey guys!

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:15.629
Julia here for DNews

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:18.050
The placebo effect fascinates me.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.750
How can a sugar pill heal someone just with
the power of belief?

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.710
This effect is probably the basis for a lot
of ancient medicine.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.660
Where spells, powders, and rituals ruled the
day.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.840
A lot of pomp and circumstance would certainly
convince most people of the power of the medicine.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.930
But it’s not just in the past.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.040
Even today, most doctors admit to prescribing
a placebo… i mean, antibiotics for a cold!?

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.870
REALLY!? but doctors aren’t dumb, they are
just trying to make you feel better.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.500
Maybe just going to the doctor, being in a
doctor’s office, the whole shebang can make

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.329
you feel better, just like a healing ritual
would have done thousands of years ago.

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.210
Even if it’s just all in your head.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.160
But in some cases even knowing it’s a placebo
doesn’t change the outcome.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.149
One study published in PLOS One found that
even if researchers say “this is a sugar

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.229
pill” and write placebo on the bottle, the
patients reported improvement in their symptoms!

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.690
So it really does seem like the doctor-patient
relationship has a lot to do with it.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.190
But while placebos might seem like a magical
cure, not everyone is susceptible to the effect.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.240
In a review published in the journal Trends
in Molecular Medicine, researchers from Beth

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.620
Israel Deaconess Medical Center and from Brigham
and Women's Hospital introduce the idea of

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.700
a placebome.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.159
Or the idea that your genes affect whether
or not the placebo effect will work on you.

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.210
This could explain decades of strange results
with placebos.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.909
Not everyone responds to them.

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.920
Most research suggests that placebos improve
health in both subjective and objective measures

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.480
in 30-40% of people.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.270
While that’s still not most people, that’s
a pretty large percentage.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.229
One of the first studies to suggest a genetic
link, was published in 2008, in the journal

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.229
Neuroscience.

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.759
The study found that placebos, in this case
a sugar pill, worked in treating anxiety in

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.979
40% of the trial participants who got it.

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.400
The researchers found those who took the sugar
pill had decreased activity in the amygdala,

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.920
suggesting that the placebo worked through
the same mechanisms as the active drug in

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.920
the trial.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.920
The study also analyzed genes that regulate
serotonin in the brain.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.090
The researchers found that only people with
certain alleles or types of genes had that

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.150
regulation of activity in the amygdala.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.540
In another study in 2012, one of the researchers
from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.820
found a specific gene which acts on dopamine
in the brain.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.069
She found that people with a different version
of the gene responded differently to placebos.

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.700
Maybe because people with the different gene
have different levels of dopamine available

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.660
in the prefrontal cortex.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.490
Dopamine has been implicated in the “confirmation
bias” feeling.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.410
So maybe people with this gene expect the
drug to work, so they look for confirmation

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.890
of this expectation.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.290
So even if they are getting a sugar pill,
the soothing words of the doctor confirms

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.160
their expectation that the drug will work.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.290
It’ll certainly be an interesting area of
research to keep an eye on.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.879
And it raises a lot of issues like, it suggests
that placebos run through the same neurotransmitters

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.300
as drug responses.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.180
Which could have a huge impact on the way
we research drugs.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.040
Do placebos and drugs interact?

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.680
Should drug trials always include a “no-treatment”
group?

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.680
So what do you think?

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.310
If placebos work, are they really that bad?

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:11.730
