00:00:06.828 --> 00:00:08.654
You probably know the feeling.

00:00:08.654 --> 00:00:12.509
Your phone utters 
its final plaintive "bleep"

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.917
and cuts out in the middle of your call.

00:00:14.917 --> 00:00:18.802
In that moment, you may feel more
like throwing your battery across the room

00:00:18.802 --> 00:00:20.855
than singing its praises,

00:00:20.855 --> 00:00:24.683
but batteries are a triumph of science.

00:00:24.683 --> 00:00:28.027
They allow smartphones 
and other technologies to exist

00:00:28.027 --> 00:00:32.484
without anchoring us 
to an infernal tangle of power cables.

00:00:32.484 --> 00:00:35.769
Yet even the best batteries
will diminish daily,

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:39.717
slowly losing capacity 
until they finally die.

00:00:39.717 --> 00:00:41.101
So why does this happen,

00:00:41.101 --> 00:00:45.571
and how do our batteries even store
so much charge in the first place?

00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:50.249
It all started in the 1780s
with two Italian scientists,

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:53.655
Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta,

00:00:53.655 --> 00:00:55.356
and a frog.

00:00:55.356 --> 00:00:58.596
Legend has it that as Galvani
was studying a frog's leg,

00:00:58.596 --> 00:01:02.233
he brushed a metal instrument 
up against one of its nerves,

00:01:02.233 --> 00:01:04.674
making the leg muscles jerk.

00:01:04.674 --> 00:01:07.403
Galvani called this animal electricity,

00:01:07.403 --> 00:01:12.225
believing that a type of electricity
was stored in the very stuff of life.

00:01:12.225 --> 00:01:13.854
But Volta disagreed,

00:01:13.854 --> 00:01:17.834
arguing that it was the metal itself
that made the leg twitch.

00:01:17.834 --> 00:01:22.463
The debate was eventually settled
with Volta's groundbreaking experiment.

00:01:22.463 --> 00:01:27.858
He tested his idea with a stack
of alternating layers of zinc and copper,

00:01:27.858 --> 00:01:32.486
separated by paper or cloth
soaked in a salt water solution.

00:01:32.486 --> 00:01:38.947
What happened in Volta's cell is something
chemists now call oxidation and reduction.

00:01:38.947 --> 00:01:42.796
The zinc oxidizes,
which means it loses electrons,

00:01:42.796 --> 00:01:48.587
which are, in turn, gained by the ions in
the water in a process called reduction,

00:01:48.587 --> 00:01:50.966
producing hydrogen gas.

00:01:50.966 --> 00:01:53.736
Volta would have been shocked 
to learn that last bit.

00:01:53.736 --> 00:01:56.369
He thought the reaction 
was happening in the copper,

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.359
rather than the solution.

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:01.206
None the less, 
we honor Volta's discovery today

00:02:01.206 --> 00:02:05.967
by naming our standard unit 
of electric potential "the volt."

00:02:05.967 --> 00:02:11.680
This oxidation-reduction cycle creates
a flow of electrons between two substances

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.301
and if you hook a lightbulb 
or vacuum cleaner up between the two,

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:17.066
you'll give it power.

00:02:17.066 --> 00:02:21.369
Since the 1700s, scientists have improved
on Volta's design.

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:26.621
They've replaced the chemical solution
with dry cells filled with chemical paste,

00:02:26.621 --> 00:02:28.389
but the principle is the same.

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:32.006
A metal oxidizes, 
sending electrons to do some work

00:02:32.006 --> 00:02:35.969
before they are regained 
by a substance being reduced.

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:38.500
But any battery has a finite 
supply of metal,

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.355
and once most of it has oxidized, 
the battery dies.

00:02:42.355 --> 00:02:46.559
So rechargeable batteries give us 
a temporary solution to this problem

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:50.823
by making the oxidation-reduction 
process reversible.

00:02:50.823 --> 00:02:53.683
Electrons can flow back 
in the opposite direction

00:02:53.683 --> 00:02:56.181
with the application of electricity.

00:02:56.181 --> 00:02:59.614
Plugging in a charger draws 
the electricity from a wall outlet

00:02:59.614 --> 00:03:02.799
that drives the reaction 
to regenerate the metal,

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:07.577
making more electrons available 
for oxidation the next time you need them.

00:03:07.577 --> 00:03:10.377
But even rechargeable batteries 
don't last forever.

00:03:10.377 --> 00:03:14.228
Over time, the repetition of this process
causes imperfections

00:03:14.228 --> 00:03:19.530
and irregularities in the metal's surface
that prevent it from oxidizing properly.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.940
The electrons are no longer available
to flow through a circuit

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.836
and the battery dies.

00:03:24.836 --> 00:03:27.021
Some everyday rechargeable batteries

00:03:27.021 --> 00:03:31.348
will die after only hundreds 
of discharge-recharge cycles,

00:03:31.348 --> 00:03:36.687
while newer, advanced batteries
can survive and function for thousands.

00:03:36.687 --> 00:03:39.410
Batteries of the future 
may be light, thin sheets

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.173
that operate on the principles 
of quantum physics

00:03:42.173 --> 00:03:45.908
and last for hundreds 
of thousands of charge cycles.

00:03:45.908 --> 00:03:49.276
But until scientists find a way 
to take advantage of motion

00:03:49.276 --> 00:03:51.968
to recharge your cell battery,
like cars do,

00:03:51.968 --> 00:03:54.697
or fit solar panels 
somewhere on your device,

00:03:54.697 --> 00:03:56.815
plugging your charger into the wall,

00:03:56.815 --> 00:03:59.798
rather than expending 
one battery to charge another

00:03:59.798 --> 00:04:03.875
is your best bet to forestall 
that fatal "bleep."
