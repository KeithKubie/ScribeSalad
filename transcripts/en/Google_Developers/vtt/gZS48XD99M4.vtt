JOHN: Hi, guys, I'm
John [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:03.950
I'm here from the
YouTube marketing team.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.290
I'm so excited to be here with
Leap Motion CEO and co-founder

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.006
Michael Buckwald.

00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:10.380
And before we get
started, I just

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.440
want to explain what
this space is all about.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.860
Obviously we're in
the distribute section

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.470
of the sandbox, and we're
all about talking about

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.000
once the product is
designed and developed,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.180
how do you get it out there?

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.840
How do you distribute it?

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.870
And Michael in here on hand,
after building an amazing piece

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.480
of technology, to talk about
how he did that, the struggles

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.530
he faced, and what advice
we could get out of that.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.575
So Michael, I'm super
excited to have you here.

00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:35.010
MICHAEL BUCKWALD:
Very happy to be here.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.593
JOHN: Awesome.

00:00:35.593 --> 00:00:38.050
I got to tell you, when
I heard we confirmed you,

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.577
I feel like my inner like
science fiction fan came out,

00:00:40.577 --> 00:00:42.660
because, like, the technology
that you're making--

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.910
and I'll let you talk about
instead of me [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.618
I feel like you're
bringing that to life,

00:00:46.618 --> 00:00:48.280
and just breaking all frontiers.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.230
So why don't you
tell us a little bit

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.864
about what Leap
Motion is all about.

00:00:50.864 --> 00:00:51.530
What does it do.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.988
MICHAEL BUCKWALD:
Well, Leap Motion

00:00:52.988 --> 00:00:56.710
is about tracking hands
and fingers in space

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.660
very accurately,
and in a way that

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.310
can be applied to anything
that has a computer.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.239
So we want people
to feel like they

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.290
are reaching through
their computer screen,

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.800
reaching into the digital
world, and doing things

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.050
like molding a piece of
clay with their fingers,

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.730
grabbing a ball and throwing it.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.250
All the things that
we're able to do

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.050
with the physical
world around us,

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.110
making those possible in the
same easy, accessible way

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.250
than we have interacted
with the physical world

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.097
our entire lives.

00:01:27.097 --> 00:01:27.680
JOHN: Awesome.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.820
Awesome.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.980
And let's just talk about
how it looks tactically.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.220
It's a physical, little device
that goes below-- it plugs

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.930
into your USB.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.676
Can you talk about
how the looks, so we

00:01:35.676 --> 00:01:37.550
get just a clear idea
of what Leap Motion is?

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.383
MICHAEL BUCKWALD: Yeah,
so the first product

00:01:39.383 --> 00:01:42.030
based on the technology is
the Leap Motion controller,

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.750
which we're selling for $79.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.910
And it's a small lighter
or pack-of-gum sized device

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.080
that connects via
USB to a computer

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.860
and turns the area
around the computer

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.680
into a 3D interaction space,
so that you can use your hands

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.415
and fingers above the device
to control the computer.

00:02:03.415 --> 00:02:04.860
JOHN: Yeah, it's fascinating.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.110
And I'm just curious-- how
many people in the audience

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.631
and heard about
Leap Motion before?

00:02:08.631 --> 00:02:09.130
Awesome.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.130
Awesome.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.370
So new technology is
really pushing the ground.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.580
Some people say that it may make
the keyboard, the mouse a thing

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.239
of the past.

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.780
I know perhaps you're
trying to think

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.664
about it as a
complementary, or thinking

00:02:21.664 --> 00:02:22.830
about those things evolving.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.880
But have you ever had a
moment where you thought

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.160
that the product was
perhaps [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.916
ahead of what
consumers are used to?

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:31.290
And how have you
adapted to that?

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.090
MICHAEL BUCKWALD: I think the
way that we think about it is,

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.580
in terms of a five
or ten year journey.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.800
So our goal has always been to
transform how people interact

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.250
with computers, and for us that
means not just the PC, but also

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.545
transforming how people
interact with their car,

00:02:52.545 --> 00:02:57.660
or their TV, their VR
headset, their mobile device,

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.000
and computers and form factors
that don't exist today at all.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.602
And we're starting with
the PC, and for the PC,

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:07.810
it isn't about replacing
the mouse or keyboard-- it's

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.990
about doing all the
things that you just

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.350
can't do well with
the mouse or keyboard.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.090
But we don't really think of
ourselves as early or late,

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.370
it's about bringing
a motion control

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.880
to the world, one
market at a time,

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.210
over a significant
period of time.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.740
Probably five or ten years.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.440
JOHN: And what-- I know you
mentioned those pain points.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.330
What do you think Leap
Motion is helping push past?

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.020
What is Leap Motion
helping to made easier

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.965
by changing the form factor of
interacting with your computer?

00:03:42.965 --> 00:03:45.830
MICHAEL BUCKWALD: Yeah, the
inspiration for the technology

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.670
goes back to a problem
that my co-founder David

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.530
Holz-- he's our CTO-- realized
six or seven years ago.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.310
Which is that even though a
small child can build something

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.730
out of Play-Doh that kind
of looks like a coffee

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.790
cup in minutes, a professional
3D modeler takes a half hour

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:06.770
to do the same thing.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.000
Or an hour to the same thing.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.450
And that wasn't because
computers aren't powerful,

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.110
because everyone
in this room has

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.160
a processor in
their pockets that's

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.630
more powerful than a
supercomputer was 15 years ago.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.310
It's not because
people aren't creative.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.510
It's because there's
a barrier between us

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.530
and our computers,
and technology.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.270
And that barrier
are input devices,

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.990
like mice and
keyboards, which are

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.940
binary-- you are
pushing the x button

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.510
or you're not
pushing the x button.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.920
You're clicking the
left mouse button,

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.378
not clicking the
left mouse button.

00:04:37.378 --> 00:04:42.280
And if you compare that to an
action, like grabbing a cup

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.490
and drinking from it, that's
incredibly complex action,

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.720
but we do things like that
thousands of times a day.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.726
We're successful
100% of the time.

00:04:50.726 --> 00:04:52.350
And it's completely
thoughtless for us.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.990
And because we've evolved
an almost magical ability

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.660
to use our hands and
fingers to interact

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.660
with the physical world.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.580
And that's what we want
to bring to computers.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.050
So that someone can see a piece
of clay, see a physical object,

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.720
reach in, and because they
already know how to do that,

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.420
they can be doing
something like 3D model

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.190
that they never would
have been able to do

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.310
with the keyboard, and
mouse, and drop-down menus,

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.726
and instruction books,
and keyboard shortcuts.

00:05:14.726 --> 00:05:15.495
JOHN: Right.

00:05:15.495 --> 00:05:16.120
That's awesome.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.770
And I think a lot
of developers have

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.270
seen the value of what you're
trying to do with Leap Motion.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.345
I know we were touching
on it the other day,

00:05:21.345 --> 00:05:24.300
and you mentioned that there's
over 100,000 developers

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.380
currently trying to build
on the Leap Motion platform.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.019
How do you get to the
community around the product,

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:31.810
and did you have that
mindset from day one,

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.110
or is that just
something that evolved?

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.070
MICHAEL BUCKWALD: Yeah.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.210
We've always wanted developers
to be on the platform.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.810
And we have to focus on making
great tracking technology

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.950
and building great
tools for developers,

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.280
but we can't possibly create
all of the experiences

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.650
or tackle all the problems
where Leap Motion is valuable.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.100
Because the technology
this has implications

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.130
that are as diverse
as casual games

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.540
to surgeons in
the operating room

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.180
and professional engineers.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.500
And so we absolutely have always
wanted to empower developers

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.900
to do great things
with platform,

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.200
and today as you said, there
are about 100,000 developers

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.490
in over 100 countries that
are using the device to

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.510
and do really,
really interesting--

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.820
that makes us feel great.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.590
JOHN: And can take me
through, because I'm trying

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.540
sit in the shoes of a
lot of I/O attendees,

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:30.460
maybe you have a
product out there,

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.120
maybe you have a
platform where developers

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.203
are trying to build on it.

00:06:33.203 --> 00:06:36.570
How did you, from day
one, go from one developer

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.510
to 100,000 developers?

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.720
Like, how did you-- did
you reach out to them,

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.715
did they hear about the product
and were so passionate about it

00:06:43.715 --> 00:06:44.756
and wanted to develop it?

00:06:44.756 --> 00:06:46.901
How did that process
happen for somebody

00:06:46.901 --> 00:06:49.400
who's trying to get their first
developer on their platform,

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:49.803
let's say?

00:06:49.803 --> 00:06:51.719
MICHAEL BUCKWALD: Yeah,
it's a great question.

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:55.030
And I think that the
biggest thing was the fact

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:59.480
that people are excited about
and really care about this.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:04.330
And like you said, the reason
that so much of science fiction

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.330
for such a long time
has talked about

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.680
and depicted new
interfaces-- I think

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.960
it does reflect this sort
of subconscious realization

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.480
that-- or conscious
realization-- that we need more

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.945
with computers, and that it
is the input and the interface

00:07:19.945 --> 00:07:21.130
that is holding us back.

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.470
And I think that developers,
more than most people,

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:25.440
realize that as well.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.120
So I think there is just
this intrinsic excitement

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.210
to being able to build
something truly new,

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:35.890
and solve problems
that are fundamental.

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:39.239
Like, what is the best way
to build an application where

00:07:39.239 --> 00:07:41.280
someone is interacting
with the 3D model of Leap?

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.700
What's the best way to
build an application where

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.520
an elementary school child
learns by dissecting an animal?

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.020
What's the best way to build
something like a shooting game,

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.800
with motion control?

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.750
Those sorts of problems are not
tackled on a daily basis when

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:00.310
developing for other things, and
for some developers, that's not

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:03.950
attractive, but for many,
it's exciting and challenging,

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:06.250
and they get to be a part
of building foundations

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.400
that will help other
developers, as well.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.380
But there are also little, but
very important things we do.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:15.850
We work with developers
very closely,

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:18.760
and we attend events
all over the world

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.650
and show the
technology to people.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:23.740
And we've devoted a lot
of energy to the SDK

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.740
and making it really easy
for people to develop.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.750
And that's an ongoing journey.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.560
There are many things
we are doing today,

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.059
and an infinite number of
things we can do in the future

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:36.059
to make it easier and
more accessible to people.

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:38.939
JOHN: Absolutely and in addition
to showcasing Leap's technology

00:08:38.939 --> 00:08:40.480
at events around
the world, it sounds

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.771
like you're hosting events
at Leap Motion headquarters,

00:08:42.771 --> 00:08:44.894
and bringing developers
in month by month

00:08:44.894 --> 00:08:46.560
to help them interact
with your product.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.580
Can you talk a little bit
about what these events are,

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.920
and how what exactly
happens at then

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.760
with the company
and the developers?

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.840
MICHAEL BUCKWALD:
One thing that I

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.780
think has been very successful
for us, besides attending

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:03.070
outside events, has been
to host our own meet-ups,

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:05.830
bring developers in, and
that gives us a chance

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:08.470
to speak a little bit
more informally with them

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:11.220
than we would at
big public events.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.560
Or do things like blog
posts on social media

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.510
to show them what
we're working on

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:19.300
before we release
it to the public.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:24.330
And we also do pretty
often bring developers

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.710
into our office
on a casual basis,

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:29.430
if we have a feature we want to
test, if we just want to talk,

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:32.294
or have a round table about the
SDK, or something like that,

00:09:32.294 --> 00:09:33.210
we'll do that as well.

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.370
And that's really,
really helpful.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:39.350
Ultimately, the people
whose entire lives-- or even

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.940
they're sort of a more amateur
or part-time developer--

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:45.040
the people who are
passionate about developing

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.130
on top of a platform,
they have so much

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:48.660
expertise from that focus.

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.550
So it's really important.

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:51.930
JOHN: That's fantastic.

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:54.140
So can you talk a little
bit more about your journey?

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:55.890
Are there any things
you wish you would've

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:59.280
done differently in distributing
Leap Motion technology doing

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.020
your early days?

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:01.840
Any mistakes that
we could learn from,

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.870
to avoid in and move on from?

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:07.740
MICHAEL BUCKWALD: Yeah, I mean
we've made a lot of mistakes,

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.870
we probably make
mistakes every day.

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:13.550
And what we're
trying to do, and I

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.330
think what anyone
trying to build

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:20.490
a platform and a fundamentally
new interface has to do,

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:23.440
is such a broad
challenge, that there

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:27.580
are countless ways they
will make mistakes.

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.080
Countless ways
we've made mistakes.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.730
But I think the
most important thing

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:35.920
is to be really, really
focused on the core value

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.670
that technology brings.

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:44.440
And in our case, that is
the tracking and developers.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:48.210
And making sure that you have
really strong relationships

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:49.930
with those developers.

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:54.360
And I think that as long
as people have that focus,

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.040
they will overcome
and sort of thrive

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.970
from the inevitable
mistakes that they'll make.

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:02.035
JOHN: Awesome.

00:11:02.035 --> 00:11:03.410
Something else
that caught my eye

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:05.230
when we were talking
the other day

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:07.941
was, you mentioned that
you're in over 3,000 stores

00:11:07.941 --> 00:11:09.690
and distributing Leap
Motion's technology.

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:11.600
Can you again take me
to the early days of,

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.558
who is the first store
that you partnered with?

00:11:13.558 --> 00:11:16.904
How do you even get
that relationship going?

00:11:16.904 --> 00:11:18.320
Because I know a
lot of people are

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.100
building amazing technology.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.674
And the big thing
is, OK, I have it,

00:11:21.674 --> 00:11:23.090
but how do I get
it out in stores?

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:24.420
How do I get it in
consumers' hands?

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:26.128
And I think you've
done such a great job,

00:11:26.128 --> 00:11:28.530
both on the developer front
and the consumer front.

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:29.810
So if you could talk a
little bit about that,

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:30.360
that would be awesome.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.460
MICHAEL BUCKWALD:
That's a great question.

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.380
When we launched
about a year ago,

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.740
our only retail
partner was Best Buy.

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.570
Which is a major retail
partner, and they

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:41.200
have about 1,000
stores in the U. S.,

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.680
but we had no international
retail presence,

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:49.640
and since then, we've had to
build out our own retail sales

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:50.370
team.

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:53.750
And we have to how people
in Europe and Japan

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:56.710
and China working
with retailers.

00:11:56.710 --> 00:12:01.910
But today, we are in about
3,000 stores in '15 countries.

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:04.400
It is very challenging
to get retail.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:09.120
And I think that maybe it
should be the primary focus,

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:14.370
because even before we were in
retail, the best thing we did

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:15.940
was take pre-orders
from customers.

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.920
And whether you do that through
traditional pre-orders that you

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.730
take on your
website, like we did,

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:23.250
or through some sort
of crowd funding,

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:25.940
I think that is the
best way to demonstrate

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:29.920
real, tangible, material
interest in the product,

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:35.390
and you can then take
that to retailers.

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:36.720
And that's very powerful.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:43.070
That's probably, far and
away, the most efficient way.

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:44.950
And also, the
reality is that you

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:49.310
can build a successful business
with hardware, selling it

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:52.450
to customers through
your own website today.

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:54.329
And you could
certainly, that's how

00:12:54.329 --> 00:12:55.745
we work with the
pre-order period,

00:12:55.745 --> 00:12:57.250
but even after the
pre-order period,

00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:59.980
your own website can be a major
sales channel today in a way

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.040
it wasn't before.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.040
So even if you can't
get retail, you

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:07.760
can still build a great business
selling a product directly

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:08.480
consumers.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.230
JOHN: And so yeah, I think we've
seen a paradigm shift in how

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:13.559
commerces work, moving online.

00:13:13.559 --> 00:13:15.350
So, in closing, I want
to ask one question,

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:16.933
and then I want to
open it up you guys

00:13:16.933 --> 00:13:18.940
to be able to ask
questions of Michael,

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:20.430
any other last pieces of advice?

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:24.237
I'll preface this
with saying, no cliche

00:13:24.237 --> 00:13:26.570
answers of how somebody can
get out there and distribute

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:27.360
their product.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.510
Anything you learned
during your journey

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:30.040
that you want to share
here before we open it up

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:30.581
to the floor?

00:13:30.581 --> 00:13:33.300
MICHAEL BUCKWALD: Well, I think
that the most important thing,

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.070
I'd say, is people shouldn't
be afraid to build hardware

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:36.570
products.

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:39.604
And I say that even though
we don't necessarily

00:13:39.604 --> 00:13:41.770
think of ourselves, strictly
speaking, as a hardware

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:44.910
product, but even
today and there

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:47.440
is sort of this cloud
around hardware,

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.210
in the sense that it's too
expensive, or it's too hard,

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:52.230
or it takes too long.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:54.160
But there are a lot
of real advantages

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.300
to building a hardware
product, and I think,

00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:00.100
had we not chosen to first build
a peripheral before we tried

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.170
working with OEMs
like HP and others,

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:05.300
to embed the technology, I
think we'd still be here,

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:07.720
calling up people and trying
to convince them to embed it.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:12.260
Because other people are slow
and OEMs are risk averse,

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.260
and I'm not going
to say have to,

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:19.740
but if you decide that you have
to own it yourself, and build

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:22.720
it entirely yourself, you
shouldn't be afraid to do that.

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.970
Because there is an incredible
ecosystem that exists today

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:28.560
they didn't necessarily
exist a few years ago.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:33.420
And that makes it, not easy,
but possible for startups

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:35.445
to build hardware and
distribute it globally.

00:14:35.445 --> 00:14:36.545
JOHN: Fantastic.

00:14:36.545 --> 00:14:39.170
So it that, I think we're going
to take the mike from the back.

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:42.102
So if you guys have
questions, we can ask Michael.

00:14:42.102 --> 00:14:44.060
So does anybody have a
question to ask Michael?

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:49.290
Nobody?

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:50.120
There you go.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.250
AUDIENCE: Hi, Michael.

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:54.890
My question is, when you first
started to get the marketing

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:59.070
material out, how many
different forms of online media

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:01.170
did you use, because I
know, like, social media is

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:02.140
really important now.

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.730
So did you use all
mediums on social media,

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:08.000
or did you just use like,
content media online,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.804
like through Google search?

00:15:09.804 --> 00:15:13.360
MICHAEL BUCKWALD:
It's a great question.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:16.787
And I think we've tried
to embrace all media.

00:15:16.787 --> 00:15:18.370
I don't know if we've
quite succeeded,

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:20.870
because I think
one of the things

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:23.050
that we are still
developing, for example,

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:27.820
is having a bigger presence
in global social media.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:34.460
But at least in terms of
the English-based social,

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:37.570
we've used pretty
much all the channels.

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:39.830
And I think you have to do that.

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:44.140
The cost to integrating
another social channel

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:47.330
is pretty low,
relative to the value,

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:50.490
assuming that it has a
sufficiently big audience.

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:53.820
And I think any platform
or anything that

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.942
is sufficiently different,
needs to reach out

00:15:55.942 --> 00:15:57.150
to a lot of different people.

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:59.800
Like we want surgeons
to know about Leap,

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.880
but we want elementary school
teachers to know about Leap.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:07.050
And that requires us
to reach out broadly.

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:11.960
So I think we've tried to
do that with media as well.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.960
JOHN: So with that, I
just want to thank Michael

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.220
so much for his time, and thank
you guys for participating.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.500
Thanks so much.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:19.520
Awesome.

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.870
[APPLAUSE]
