00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.350
Hello, I'm Daven Hiskey, you're watching the
TodayIFoundOut YouTube channel.

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.310
In the video today, we're looking at whether
it's actually true that drinking alcohol is

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.250
a good way to warm yourself up on a cold day.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.480
A common remedy to stave off frigid temperatures
on festive outdoor occasions is to drink alcohol.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.360
But does drinking alcohol actually warm your
body?

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.030
In short, no, it does not.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.280
In fact, drinking alcohol helps lower the
core temperature of your body.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.040
The myth that alcohol warms you up likely
got its start thanks to the fact that drinking

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.480
alcoholic beverages will make you feel warmer
as your blood/alcohol level rises.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.890
As the Director of Clinical Pharmacology at
the University of Iowa, Dr. William Haynes,

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.010
states, "Consumption of alcohol undoes many
of the human body's healthy reflexes, one

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.160
of which is keeping the core body temperature
warm in cold weather."

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.579
It doesn't even take that much for this effect
to kick in.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.830
Even just one alcoholic drink will start the
process that results in a lowered core body

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:51.830
temperature.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.829
So how does it do this and why does drinking
alcohol make you feel warmer, even though

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:56.649
you actually are getting colder?

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.629
Alcohol is a vasodilator, meaning that it
causes your blood vessels to dilate, particularly

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.570
the capillaries under the surface of your
skin.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.290
Thus, the volume of blood brought to the skin's
surface increases, making you feel warm.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.830
As Dr. Haynes mentioned, this overrides one
of your body's defenses against cold temperatures,

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.670
constricting your blood vessels, thereby minimizing
blood flow to your skin in order to keep your

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.240
core body temperature up.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.729
While you may feel warmer from the extra blood
warming your skin (where most of your body's

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.850
thermoreceptors are located), this blood being
brought close to the surface of your skin

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.409
will be rapidly cooled if you are in a cold
environment (sometimes exacerbated by sweating

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.230
as a result of this heat flush).

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.590
The net effect is a rapid drop in core body
temperature, often without you even realizing

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.100
it as your skin will feel fairly warm, which
makes it doubly dangerous to drink alcohol

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.950
in extremely cold weather.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.159
You can observe this dilation effect when
you see people who are slightly or fully intoxicated

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.200
looking flushed.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.549
This effect is more extreme in some people
than others, so if you're one of those people

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.240
who gets flushed quickly when drinking even
small amounts of alcohol, you'll likely see

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.520
your core temperature drop even faster than
most when drinking in frigid environments.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.619
This isn't the only bad thing about drinking
alcohol when cold.

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.360
According to a study done by the Army Research
Institute of Environmental Medicine, drinking

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.659
alcohol in cold weather also reduces the body's
ability and tendency to shiver, taking away

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:13.980
yet another method your body uses to help
keep warm when it is cold.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.549
So, bottom line, the age old practice of drinking
alcoholic beverages to keep the body warm

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.659
in cold weather is the exact opposite of what
you should do in such a situation.
