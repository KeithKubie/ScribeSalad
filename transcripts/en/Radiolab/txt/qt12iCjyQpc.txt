Speaker 1:          00:00          This is Radiolab. You are Robert Krulwich and you're Jad Abumrad and today our topic on radiolab is sleep. Yep. It is something that all of us do. We can't help but do it. It's dangerous to do. It's so good and it's universal. I think about it, you know, sleep is dangerous and if sleep could have been circumvented in some way, natural selection probably would have found a way to do it. But Steve Lima again from Indiana State University. Yeah, it because it would, it just, it'd be such a great idea to not sleep, don't I know it, but there are times when you just can't sleep. Right. Maybe you're one of the 35 million Americans I am. Who has chronic insomnia. Yeah. You just can't sleep. You don't know why it just doesn't happen. Or maybe you do it to yourself and you pull all nighters for school or you have to drive long distances or, and here's what we want to turn our attention to next. Maybe it is done to you. That's the case with producer Hannah Palin. She kept this audio diary of her own experiment with sleep deprivation.

Speaker 2:          01:00          She has an 18 month old son. It's two 54 for the record.

Speaker 3:          01:18          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:18          today was my first day back at work. We were discussing budgets. I just, I just, I couldn't even articulate what it was that I was seeing on the computer screen and try to communicate that to the curator that I work for. The words didn't come down on me instead of saying, well, Nicolette, I believe that that choice was made because no, no. All that came out was like, um, honey buckets. I mean, nothing, nothing would come out. There's just no brain cells really. Wow. So anyway, that was my first day back at work.

Speaker 3:          02:13          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          02:14          where do you stop it

Speaker 2:          02:17          Dominic? Well, not sleep. I'm trying to get him to sleep and kind of at my wit's end cut. This just sucks. It totally sucks. Here's the funny thing. Everybody has a theory, and I was talking to my sister in law tonight and her theory is that he's not getting enough milk because milk has some agent in it that would help him sleep and he doesn't like milk. It's true. Other people say, Oh, if he just read exercise him, if he just gets fresh air and exercise, he'll sleep all night. If he just let him cry, would sleep all night if you just would do whatever it is we're not doing. He would sleep all night.

Speaker 2:          03:10          Okay. And there's this feeling like there's a feeling like I am doing it all wrong and that I'm a failure as a parent and I don't know how to do this. Come here sweetie. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. So anyway, I needed to record just one thing really quickly and that is that yesterday and today I've been struck by fantastic. I'm instructed by these waves of satisfaction and delight with being alive in this amazing landscape with the funny kid [inaudible] mountains and, and water. And I don't know, maybe it's just getting a little more sleep in the last couple of days, but I suddenly feel like, wow, I'm so lucky.

Speaker 2:          04:13          Okay, I've got to take my kid to play now. Here we go. Do you know the Muffin man? The muffin man? [inaudible] okay. That whole I'm loving life. Yeah. That's all gone now. And it's pretty much because Dominic won't take a nap. We came home from the beach, which I thought would wear him out. Then we sat down and read some stories, which for some reason, and I realized that an element to the sleep deprivation and an element to this whole thing is that I get angry from having my own needs subverted to the needs of this little tiny person, which when you're not sleep deprived is not a big deal. Oh, tired. I tired. I don't cry. [inaudible] I don't want to wish a minute of Dominic's childhood away cause it's so precious to me. But I, I'm looking forward to, uh, that moment when, um, I am able to say, honey, I have to go to sleep and he does it die here? No, not die. [inaudible] eyes. Your Eyes Buck. Okay. Close your eye. There's my personal take on what it's like to be sleepy and to crave sleep as much as you crave water

Speaker 4:          05:58          or breath. I crave it. Thanks to Hannah Palin and her son, Dominick and her husband Steve. I know poor Hannah, but there is a science question looking in the background, which is when you know, when Hannah was so tired, why does she feel that way? You know what? W W what? Because she's, she hasn't been sleeping. Oh yeah, but, but what makes her, you know, what is the essence of tiredness? Lack of sleep. Hello? Chemically, I'm asking you chemicals. What is it happening to her? If you were way down in herself, could you see something tired like going on? That's what I, that's a good question actually. I'm glad you think so because I know a guy who has a theory about this. Did you see Tiger yesterday? [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          06:49          of antibody. I mean, the guy is unbelievable. This is doctor gallon pack and in addition to being a rabid golf fan, he's also a rabid, but can you be a rabid biologist? Sure. At the University of Pennsylvania, he's been looking at sleep down at the cellular level and one thing that he's found over and over and over, and that's been shown in Moses has been shown in rise, been shown in fruit fly, is that inside certain cells in all those different animals, when they're sleep deprived and Shelly, what happens is you don't get proteins properly for all the,

Speaker 4:          07:20          excuse me, proteins properly folded a phenomenon called the unfolded protein response. What on Earth does that mean? Is that a good thing or a bad thing you, you're asking why do you need proteins to properly fold? Yeah, I guess that's what I'm asking. Well, you are made of proteins. Proteins are the essence of you. So if your proteins are misshapen, if they're not folded properly, don't fold the proteins properly. They don't have the right three dimensional structure, and as a result, they start accumulating inside the cell and then these different unfolded proteins can aggregate together and front clump.

Speaker 5:          07:54          Whoops.

Speaker 4:          07:59          Inside the cell and essentially clog it up and it's really quite toxic to cells. Clumpiness equals tiredness as would be his formula. Remember when Hannah was so exhausted? Yeah. God, this just sucks. Well, because she hasn't slept much inside herself. Lots of these valuable little proteins have not folded properly that he thinks is the consequence of not having enough sleep. So maybe what's going on is the cells can't do their business quite as well and things start to break down and that adds up across the whole of your body to a fueling. But when she gets to sleep, remember when she's so happy, suddenly feel like, wow, because of the sleep, I'm so lucky. A group of cleaning reppers have gone through herself, removed the toxic and misshapen proteins so that in effect, sleep is the best housemaid you've ever had in the hotel. Have you, and this idea, the, the idea of sleep as a cleaner wrapper might even explain one of the most basic things about us as humans, how we learn. That's the notion of doctor Giulio Tononi testing, testing, testing. My producer Ellen Horn and I went to visit him at his offices in Madison, Wisconsin.

Speaker 2:          09:16          What are we expecting? What does he look like? We don't know what else, like pop player, a football player, but like a quarter backer. Tight end. Not like a so big but not overwhelming. Yes. Yeah. How do you even know that website? See, but

Speaker 4:          09:37          totally wrong. Now, to be fair, he is a very attractive guy, has sandy blonde hair and glasses, so he's actually the more that sensitive guy intellectual than a linebacker. Okay. Introduce yourself. I'm Julia [inaudible]. I am a professional psychiatry here at the University of Wisconsin Madison, but when it comes to the subject of sleep, which is his specialty, he takes sleep very seriously. Like what got you didn't sleep. Sleep is the annihilation of consciousness, so it's a terrible time in which everything disappears. The universe and yourself with it. I think if people didn't sleep and didn't have the unconscious sleep, they possibly wouldn't even realize that consciousness is an enormous gift. So being awake then is wonderful, but it's what happens when you're asleep. He says that's what allows you to make very important connections in your life. And he noticed this first, you may train when he was connecting with the, I believe it was a guitar, just playing music. I used to play, for instance, I played classical guitar. I'm sure many people who play musical instruments know that you may train and train and train on a piece during the day and you get better for sure, but you're never perfect. Oh, and then you sleep over it the next day you wake up, you play it again and now it's smooth and you know it flows. Beautiful.

Speaker 2:          10:59          That happened. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          11:00          it happened to me. It happens to lots of people.

Speaker 6:          11:01          That happened to me all the time. I discovered that sometimes if I worked on a piece and put it away, I went to bed and cut some rust. I had it better learned than if I stayed up all night cramming.

Speaker 1:          11:15          Yeah, definitely. There's one story, and I hadn't thought about this for a long time, but, well first of all, Robin, I like play in a band together. The band is called the sisterhood of convoluted thinkers and we switch instruments like a lot. She's usually the bass player. I was going to play drums, I had to learn how to play drums. So we rented a cabin, we went somewhere to rehearse and at night she was really just kind of practicing and practicing and trying to get this written one in particular be like, I've worked on it like a lot. I just keep going and going and replaying that one thing again and again and again. And I finally just gave up and went to sleep and the next morning I got up and went like straight to the kid and I just played it like immediately. The bucket, the stool, she was going [inaudible] you could just do it. I thought it was magic or you could just learn stuff in your sleep.

Speaker 4:          12:08          So wait, they were showing the middle of the night somehow the things that your fingers did repeatedly and the notes that you were using to propel your fingers. All those things somehow got into that more. Got Better learned. So you learned overnight or you, I mean what does have to do with it or you remember better in the morning? No. What happens is that the next day you're a bit better off what happens during the night to make you better off. This is up for contention to nannies. Contention is that sleep helps you remember by forgetting and I don't know what that means. Let me explain to you what he, what he say. He says there's a limited amount of space in your brain. The real estate in the brain speed limit, unlimited amount and makes sense as a small little guy up there. Yup. And yet every experience you have during the day he's going to take away some space, uses up a little of what you got when you are awake.

Speaker 4:          12:58          Inevitably you learn whether you want it or not. You are going round talking to me. Okay. I was having breakfast, have a medium coffee, going to work, then yakking on the phone with the you went. Your friends pop into your mind. Very different from from the friends. Then going home, taking a bath, they'll take a bath. I get it again. Everything you do during the day, every thought you think, no matter how small, it all causes your brain to form new connections. This conversation as we're having it is reshaping my brain. A little pathways are forming that weren't there before I sat down exactly whether we recognize it or not. Lots of things I go on to change your brain by the end of the Waking Day. So if in the middle of the afternoon you sit down with your guitar and you practice the guitar intently, those two hours, you're also making connections and because you're concentrating, maybe you're making more connections than usual. These are guitar connections and all those synaptic connections made during the day. Wow. Just have a meeting [inaudible] by the time you're ready,

Speaker 5:          14:05          I'm ready for sleep up in your kitchen. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          14:16          and that is where we think sleep kicks in. Well, I'm going to guess here, but I think you think that sleep is a garbage detail that comes into is okay, you're done. You're done. You're done. It's actually even simpler than that. According to Noni, there's not really a janitor who comes in and decides, okay, you have to leave. You get to stay. Nothing like that. Instead he says, what happens? We think that doing sleep waves of electrical activity, kind of like a late evening bath wash over your head. They start at the back of your head. I mean you move to the front. These waves are called slow or salacious and the course of the night 1000 times a night, those waves wash through all the experiences of your day, all the little synaptic connections that you made all day long and every one of those connections, all of that gets just a little bit softer.

Speaker 4:          15:06          They get weaker progressively, gracefully. They get weaker even he says the things you want to hold onto like the guitar. Wait a second. Wait a second. You are the one who said you learned how to play the instrument in the afternoon. You went to sleep and you play the instrument better in the morning. Yep. Why would you wake up the next morning playing better? You should play more weekly with less confidence and less memory. Because after all, you've just given the whole place a bath. It's all relative, sir. What he means by relative is this, that that mass of new connections in your head. Some of those connections are softer. Some of those connections were louder. The random things you ordered for lunch, they're softer. Okay? But the guitar, cause you spend so much time thinking about guitar technique, you spend so much energy on it. That's louder. So we're just measuring connections here. Now imagine that sleep is a big volume na so listen to what happens when you lower the volume on the whole day and lower.

Speaker 4:          16:09          You hear how the softer stuff just falls away. You can't hear it anymore. Yeah. Bad. The Guitar, while it's getting softer too, because it was so loud to begin with, now it stands out a bit more clearly now. Yeah. The signal seems to have survived reasonably well, are heard better because the background has become more silent. So your ability to play the guitar better the next morning is not because you've learned these skills overnight that you didn't have before is because all the other stuff taken up. Your brain has gone down in volume and you're left with relatively speaking, a better guitar fingering technique. You put your finger on it. So Mr Schenone feels that sleep is a little bit like we didn't rain like the process of erosion at the end of the day, or rather at the beginning of the morning, the things left standing are the things you need to know. We should, uh, we should go to break. Okay. So coming up next for those of us who can get this leap next, our change to dream. This is radio lab. I'm Chad, I'm rod and I rapid rolling. We'll continue in a moment.
