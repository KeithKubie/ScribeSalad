00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.630
There's this popular program called “Stranger Things” on TV and

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:10.740
as a fan and as a physicist I've come up with a theory and just forewarning there's gonna be some spoilers

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.820
In Stranger Things, one of the characters, Will, gets trapped in this sort of parallel universe

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:29.009
called the Upside Down and when he's trapped there his mom is you know really worried about him

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:34.289
But she figures out that he's not missing and that actually she can communicate with him when he's in this

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:36.400
parallel universe and she does it by

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.269
Stringing up some Christmas lights on the wall and under each light bulb she writes a letter and so from this parallel universe

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.150
The kid manages to light a light bulb above a letter and spell out a message to his mom

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.699
Yeah, basically, and so I was thinking as a physicist

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.799
How is this even possible? How does one communicate from a whole other universe to our universe in 1983?

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:12.029
And so I've come up with this theory—this physics fan theory—and I think that this is possible if

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.680
this parallel universe called the upside down is quantumly entangled with our universe.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.729
I guess we’ve got to understand quantum entanglement first. First of all you've got to get rid of everything that you know about the classical world

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.219
so in the classical world this

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.849
Is a red ball, and it will always be a red ball

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:38.608
similarly, this is a blue ball, and this will always be a blue ball, and if I sort of

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:41.669
Shuffled them around and hold one in either hand

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.169
When I say to you you know, which one is the red ball, and which one is the blue ball

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.089
We know that one of them is definitely red and one of them is definitely blue and so it's only when I open my hand

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.409
And say okay, that was the blue ball

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.858
And there was the red ball that we knew all along that this was blue, and this was red

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.489
but one of them is always blue and one of them is always red.

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:04.529
If this was the quantum world and you couldn't tell which one was red or which was blue

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:08.879
they would both be red and blue at the same time.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.709
So this is like the Schrodinger's cat example—the cat is both dead and alive at the same time.

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.700
[Brady:] They both purple?

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.980
They’re both purple—yes, they are!

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.840
So there's some sort of weird linear superposition of red and blue in the quantum world

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.220
and it's only when we again we open the hand and we see that this one is blue

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.100
that we know this one is red. But before that, they were both.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.200
So if we have two quantumly entangled particles instead

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.680
in this weird quantum mechanical world these can have sort of any properties so what I was doing there was this color was

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.960
an analogy for spin, basically

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.240
or some property of the particle so spin up and spin down and that is a very fundamental

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.060
property of particles and so if we have these

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.770
Quantumly entangled particles they don't have any spin yet, they do have spin

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.209
It's just that you can't describe one without describing the other okay

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.379
So they're in this weird superposition state where they can be both spin up and spin down

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.600
But the thing about quantumly entangled particles is that as soon as you measure them and one becomes spin up

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.540
the other one immediately becomes spin down

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:17.040
so whatever one of them does, the other one has to do the exact opposite, and that’s what quantum entanglement is.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.720
Poor Will trapped in this parallel universe if this entire universe

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.110
Was quantumly entangled with our universe then anything that Will does in the parallel universe

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.089
has to be reflected in our universe as well: the particles have to do the exact opposite

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.070
so say Will could take the light bulb in the parallel universe of the upside down and

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.379
Put a battery to it and force the electrons in that light bulb to move around a circuit

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.109
he would have given them momentum in a direction and

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:51.149
Therefore the particles in our universe would have to do the exact opposite does that mean they would also have to have momentum

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.370
But in the opposite direction and therefore also

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:59.729
Move around a circuit and therefore light up a light bulb so if he lit up a light bulb in his universe the light bulb

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.730
Would also light up in our universe

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.760
Himself

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.459
Wouldn't that when he moves the battery wouldn't the

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.849
No this is where this sort of theory is a little bit like we're gonna have to think about this

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:16.959
I mean I'm also assuming

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.048
That you know these light bulbs are in parallel you know they're not in series in their in their circuit

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.629
They're in parallel. I mean this is 1983. They could be in series

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.959
I don't know. This is the kind of thing that you have to achieve all the way you go through this theory

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:38.190
The electrons in his he'll be able to manipulate electrons in the other exactly through quantum entanglement, that's my theory

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.478
Would you like to hear how this theory is absolutely rubbish so there are many problems

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:49.038
But so as a scientist. I had to think through these problems and go through them the first question

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:56.299
I had was easy even possible to make a quantum Leontine board universe okay, so that just seems ridiculous in my head

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.029
Turned out not so ridiculous

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:05.720
So I actually found a paper quantum entanglement in the multiverse and this is you know a theoretical paper

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:07.819
but they're actually talking about it as if

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.039
we could measure whether this has actually happened in our own universe so what they're saying is if

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:19.908
Our universe is one of many and the multiverse theory holds that there are many many universes then after the Big Bang

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:27.409
Ten to the minus thirty-six seconds after the Big Bang to be precise there was this period of time called inflation where the universe

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:29.280
rapidly

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.969
inflated in the space of sort of from ten to the minus

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.019
Thirty-six to sort of like ten to the minus thirty-three seconds so a very very short space of time

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:39.139
inflated very rapidly and that has like loads of

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.819
consequences on sort of how the universe is today because any sort of teeny tiny fluctuations

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:49.158
And the particles that were created just after the Big Bang were sort of locked in so density

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:53.089
Fluctuations anything like that will then spread out over these huge

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:58.399
Distances and that meant that then some areas of the universe more dense than the others and that's how you ended up getting

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:05.630
galaxies forming their eccentric cetera so they're saying if you have inflation in the multiverse and you're creating sort of child

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.109
universes from say our parent universe so lots of

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:14.538
Multiverses are sort of springing off and you have inflation then the same properties are going to be

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:19.309
Imprinted in one universe as in the child universe as well like in identical twins

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.279
So that's what inflation would do it would imprint both those things

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:27.019
And if you had two particles that work in these quantum the entanglement state in the beginning

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:32.659
Then they will be quantum entangled in these two separate universes and the really cool thing about this paper is that they suggest that actually?

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:39.919
If this was true in our universe. You'd actually be able to test whether that was true because these kind of quantum entanglement

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:48.469
Fluctuations, that would be imprinted in inflation you'd still be able to see in what's called the Cosmic Microwave Background which is this?

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:52.148
Microwave signal which is a remnant of the bang in the very early stages of the universe?

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:56.439
Where light could first escape from the early stage in the universe so I?

00:06:57.019 --> 00:07:00.489
Think that's really exciting and the fact that my crazy fan

00:07:00.489 --> 00:07:07.268
Theory could actually you know in our own universe could exist I was like that was that was one point to me

00:07:08.179 --> 00:07:12.429
That's one point. There is another problem, and it's something called quantum decoherence

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:17.258
if you have two quantum entangled particles

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:22.299
And you want to send a message between the two of them say you're doing it for like encryption or something and you move

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:26.198
One particle say you know 300 miles away and measure

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:31.239
One thing to have a certain span of momentum and therefore the other one has to do the exact opposite

00:07:31.239 --> 00:07:34.119
This is what Einstein was really concerned about you were there for

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:39.550
Sending a message faster than the speed of light because as soon as this one is measured this one

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:45.099
Automatically changes and so that is sort of this spooky action at a distance and we know that things

00:07:45.349 --> 00:07:49.509
Can't travel faster than the speed of light people have got around that now by saying well

00:07:49.509 --> 00:07:53.648
I had to physically move this 300 miles away first to send that message

00:07:53.649 --> 00:07:57.309
And I couldn't have made that travel faster than the speed of light

00:07:57.679 --> 00:08:01.958
Therefore the message itself didn't travel faster than the speed of light because if I move that you know

00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:06.939
Very very close to the speed of light say 99 percent of the speed of light over here, and then I transfer that message

00:08:07.519 --> 00:08:09.349
transfer a message back

00:08:09.349 --> 00:08:11.349
Then that has trouble fast in the speed of light

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.009
But that's not possible so as soon as I measure this one

00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:19.118
Spin up and this one it's been down that is an irreversible process

00:08:19.339 --> 00:08:23.109
And the reason for that is you've had to put energy into this system

00:08:23.319 --> 00:08:25.159
Okay, so you've had to say okay?

00:08:25.159 --> 00:08:27.188
This one has to be sped up this one has to be spin down

00:08:27.469 --> 00:08:30.759
And what you've done is you've put energy into the universe this is somehow

00:08:31.399 --> 00:08:37.119
Interacted with the environment that it's in and with the universe and you've increased the entropy of the universe

00:08:37.579 --> 00:08:43.299
So for those of you who are paying attention in school that should raise a little red flag the second law of thermodynamics

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:50.979
says that you cannot decrease the entropy of the universe so we've increased the entropy by doing that measurement and

00:08:51.709 --> 00:08:54.578
Measuring to say that yes, this one has been up and this one has been down

00:08:54.579 --> 00:09:00.339
And so you cannot reverse that process because reversing it you would have to decrease the entropy of the universe to do that

00:09:00.589 --> 00:09:04.839
so any interaction with your environment breaks quantum entanglement

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.710
So what does that mean in terms of my crazy fan? Theory as soon as?

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:12.580
Will has moved the electrons and set up a circuit in one light bulb

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:17.170
He couldn't do it again in that same light bulb so when his mum has strung up the lights

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:19.480
With a single letter under every single light

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:24.730
he won't be able to use the same letter twice so we have to get very creative with his lettering and

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:31.989
in the show he writes the words right here, so he uses e twice and

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:36.249
therefore I don't think my theory holds because

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:39.010
He wouldn't be able to use eat Weiss

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:45.610
Under our understanding of quantum entanglement and quantum decoherence. He always sees an H twice as me

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.689
Right here. Yeah, okay, okay? I'll do that again

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:07.259
So I could influence his thoughts for example

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.710
How would I influence his thoughts well I'd have to change the biochemistry

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:15.389
I was a biochemistry about it's about electrons so somehow my electrons would have to couple

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:20.220
They'd have to become strongly quantum mechanically entangled with brady's electrons
