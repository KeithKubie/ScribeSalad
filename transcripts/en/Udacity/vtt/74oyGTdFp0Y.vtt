00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:01.077
Hi Michael.

00:00:01.077 --> 00:00:02.078
&gt;&gt; Hi Charles, how are you?

00:00:02.078 --> 00:00:04.310
&gt;&gt; I'm doing fine, thanks for
asking, how are you doing?

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.980
&gt;&gt; I'm doing well, I'm exciting to be
kind of pulling the course together and

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.200
wrapping it up and putting it in a box
and sending it out into the world.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.720
&gt;&gt; Yes, me too,
it's actually been fun so far.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.600
As we tape this we
are about halfway through,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.087
I would say,
of the first iteration of the course.

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:26.730
And Michael kindly agreed to come
down Atlanta to talk to me again.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.047
So that we could mention a few other
things that we didn't get a chance to

00:00:31.047 --> 00:00:35.180
cover in the class, because we
basically just didn't have time.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.090
It's not that they weren't interesting,
but because this was a survey kind of

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.990
course, we wanted to make
certain that you had the basics.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.120
And that from there you could go off and
learn things and

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.040
really understand why
they're interesting.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.500
So, what we're going to do is just very
quickly, talk about some of the things

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.450
that are either new and interesting now,
or perhaps old that we just didn't have

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.452
time to cover, although,
may still show up on the final exam.

00:00:57.452 --> 00:00:58.075
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And plus,

00:00:58.075 --> 00:01:00.300
I believe that everyone now has
a really good background for

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.826
being able to appreciate those things.

00:01:01.826 --> 00:01:03.659
&gt;&gt; Right, I believe that's important.

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:06.780
The main goal of the course was to
give people enough of a breadth, and

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.910
just enough depth.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.296
So that they can go out into the world
and understand why something like

00:01:11.296 --> 00:01:14.040
deep neural networks are interesting or
different, or

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.440
the same, as the way we've been thinking
about these problems for years.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.102
So maybe that's a good
one to start with.

00:01:19.102 --> 00:01:22.020
So, maybe we can just talk about
some of the things we didn't cover.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.320
So, there are two big things
that are popular right now.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.720
Or that a lot of people
would have heard of.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.020
&gt;&gt; Buzz words.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.345
&gt;&gt; Buzz words but in a good way.

00:01:30.345 --> 00:01:33.620
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; As opposed to just made up stuff.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.435
Deep neural networks.

00:01:34.435 --> 00:01:35.480
&gt;&gt; Okay. Sure. &gt;&gt; Or deep learning,

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.580
which I think is how most
people talk about it.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.205
&gt;&gt; Deep learning.

00:01:38.205 --> 00:01:38.990
Sure.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.928
&gt;&gt; And big data.

00:01:39.928 --> 00:01:43.280
So, those are two kind of
things that are out there

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.860
in 2014 that people talk about.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.870
We didn't really get
a chance to mention,

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.090
how would you describe
them in 15 seconds?

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.300
&gt;&gt; So, big data is the issues that
come up when you actually have

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.220
a tremendous amount of data.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.480
So more and more now it's possible
to attach sensors to the world and

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.190
get tremendous amount of information,
either web pages or biological data.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.570
I've got a little thing that
measures my steps every day.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.570
You start to pull this data off over
enough people, there's a tremendous

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.160
resource, but also challenges in
extracting good information from it.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.100
&gt;&gt; Right.
And a lot of those challenges

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.630
are algorithmic.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.285
We talk about things like
the curse of dimensionality and

00:02:16.285 --> 00:02:18.040
now we deal with exponentially.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.540
Well, when you have big enough data,
the truth is even linear can be slow.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.810
Quadratic is unacceptable.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:24.950
&gt;&gt; Linear in the amount of data.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:25.910
&gt;&gt; Yeah, linear in the amount of data,

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.010
because you've got so
much data coming in.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.960
And, by the way, you're never
going to be able to look at it again.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.760
Because, by the time you look at
the first set of data, another day has

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.640
passed, and you've got another several
petabytes of data that are coming in.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.810
What's really nice about big data,
which is worth mentioning,

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.480
I think,
without going into too much detail.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.730
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's only been 15 seconds.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.764
So that's it.
&gt;&gt; Only been 15 seconds?

00:02:42.764 --> 00:02:43.850
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; We got another 3 or 4,

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.740
is that [LAUGH] the data,
because we have access to all this data,

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.470
it's fundamentally changed
the way science works.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.500
So it used to be people talked
about experiments and theory and

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.103
I'm sure there was something else,
about how science was done.

00:02:56.103 --> 00:02:57.706
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Something else.

00:02:57.706 --> 00:02:59.305
Like scientific method.

00:02:59.305 --> 00:03:01.570
&gt;&gt; But
now one of the new pillars of science,

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.270
which is finally agreed upon by
the scientific community is Computation.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.790
The ability to do simulation
the ability to look at the data in

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.310
order to validate models in a way
we couldn't do even 15 years ago.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.080
And that's really amazing,
it's one of the reasons why my guess is

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.760
most of the people who are looking at
this first heard about machine learning.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.280
It's one of the reasons why it's so

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.280
popular because it's applicable to these
big science problems that we care about.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.550
Okay, what about deep learning?

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.690
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so Deep Learning or
Deep Neural Nets.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.590
I think in some ways it's a reboot.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.840
Is that a word that we use now?

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.390
&gt;&gt; Reboot is a world.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.650
&gt;&gt; A prequel.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.390
No, it's a reboot.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.405
I'm going to go with reboot.

00:03:36.405 --> 00:03:37.000
&gt;&gt; Okay.
Let's go with reboot.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.240
&gt;&gt; Of neural nets, so back in the 80s,
there was this idea that you could

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.940
train up neural nets with
things like back prop.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.920
But it was not so
clear that you could do better with

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.900
multiple layers than you could
with just a single layer.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.645
Even though we know that brains are
organized into lots and lots of layers.

00:03:50.645 --> 00:03:51.900
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.240
&gt;&gt; So it kind of fell out of favor for
while, but it's back.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.270
And I think part of it is there's a new
set of techniques that can be used to

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.830
organize the computation in a way
that you can actually get valuable

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:05.330
information.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.058
Signal, coming through at each of the
different layers of the Deep Neural Net.

00:04:08.058 --> 00:04:09.190
&gt;&gt; Right.
Does it hold onto a clever

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.270
representational trick or
is there more to it than that?

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.830
&gt;&gt; I think there's a bunch
of different tricks.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.440
And one of the reasons we
didn't talk about them,

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.630
is we don't really know them.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.779
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it would take too long.

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:19.279
And.
&gt;&gt; Yes, sorry.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:20.200
It would take too long for

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:20.938
us to learn them.

00:04:20.938 --> 00:04:21.470
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Teach them.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.990
&gt;&gt; Yeah to teach them.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:25.727
It certainly would take too long,
because we understand them completely.

00:04:25.727 --> 00:04:27.540
Okay.
&gt;&gt; We have deep neural nets.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.280
&gt;&gt; We do.
Well, maybe we think we do.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.915
I guess we got things to do.

00:04:30.915 --> 00:04:32.042
Is that what we actually think we do?

00:04:32.042 --> 00:04:33.200
Isn't there a biological plausibility.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.500
I can't remember.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.510
&gt;&gt; Sure.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's go with that.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.440
Okay, so let's see.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.880
What else haven't we covered that would
be, how about semi-supervised learning?

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.540
This is something that I really wish
we could have gotten into the class and

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.970
maybe in a later iteration of
this we'll find a way to work.

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.500
&gt;&gt; We can put it half way between
supervised and unsupervised.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.150
&gt;&gt; Or we could stick it
in unsupervised learning,

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.890
like we did randomized optimization.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.750
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
it kind of fleshes it out a little bit.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.230
But anyway, the idea of semi-supervised
learning is really cool.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.974
Like it's a slightly different problem.

00:04:58.974 --> 00:05:01.410
It has elements of both supervised and
unsupervised.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.310
&gt;&gt; Like what?

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.360
&gt;&gt; So, imagine for
example, that you've got

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.930
tons of web pages that have on
them information about cities.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.870
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; And

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.610
you label them, you say this webpage
has information about this city.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.830
And this webpage has
information about this city.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.430
And you eventually you get tired
of doing that because labeling is

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:23.105
human expensive.

00:05:23.105 --> 00:05:25.800
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; So if you've got a billion web pages

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.490
and you've only have time
to label a million of them,

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.560
then there's still
a factor of a thousand.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.050
&gt;&gt; Sure let's go with that.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.781
&gt;&gt; Yeah, of pages that you
have information on them but

00:05:36.781 --> 00:05:38.540
there's no labels.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.710
And so I think in the early days people
thought since we don't have labels,

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.630
there's no really valuable
information there.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.030
The idea of semi supervised learning
is that you can actually extract using

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.280
unsupervised methods,
enough structure from the unlabeled data

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.870
that when combined with
the labelled data, its like

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.180
having the power of a lot more label
data than you actually started with.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.340
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that was a big deal in
the late 80s, early 90s in particular.
