00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:12.120
SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard was a brilliant, gloomy, anxiety-ridden, often hilarious Danish 19th century philosopher.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.620
The author of 22 books, of which 3 continue to make his name.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:22.860
He was born in an immensely wealthy family in Copenhagen in 1813, the youngest of 7 children.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.000
Death was around him constantly from a young age, and was to obsess him throughout his career.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.100
It is, in a sense, his only theme.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.320
Not only was he extremely physically frail,

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.860
by the time he was 22, all his siblings had died except for he and a brother.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.440
It drove him to furious production of books over 15 years.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.820
On a single day in 1843 he published no less than 3 works.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.280
He wasn't writing for the money; he was working to save himself, and, he thought, humanity.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.300
As it happened, he made it to the age of 42, then died of an excruciating spinal disease.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.940
In "Either/Or" and "Fear and Trembling", what Kierkegaard wants to do above all

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.880
is wake up and give up our cozy sentimental illusions.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.880
He systematically attacks the pillars of modern life: our faith in family, our trust in work, our attachment to love,

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.240
and our general sense that life has purpose and meaning.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.520
His enemies were the smug in all their guises,

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.480
particularly, the prosperous Danish haute bourgeoisie, and the members of the established Danish church.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:33.900
He tells us, "As I grew up I opened my eyes and saw the real world, and I began to laugh and I haven't stopped since.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.000
I saw that the meaning of life was to get a livelihood,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.600
that the goal of life was to be a High Court judge,

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.760
that the brightest joy of love was to marry a well-off girl,

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.520
that wisdom was what the majority said it was,

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.560
that passion was to give a speech,

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.600
that courage was to risk being fined ten dollars,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.760
that cordiality was to say "you're welcome" after a meal,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.920
and that the fear of God was to go to communion once a year.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.180
That's what I saw and I laughed."

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.680
Kierkegaard was especially caustic about the 19th century understanding of love,

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.000
and the new ideology of passionate marriage, which aimed to unite desire with prudence,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.440
and suggested that one could enjoy all the thrills of a love affair,

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.800
and, at the same time, all the stability for long-term relationship.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.860
But, Kierkegaard mocked the notion that one could ever fuse romantic laugh with marriage,

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.280
that one could have passion and sex, and, at the same time, children, stability, and routine.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.880
He respected both, he just couldn't believe you could have them both at the same time-

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.440
in a cozy marriage sanctified by the state and the neighborhoods.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.520
His belief arose out of his own tortured love life.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.820
He fell in love with a beautiful, precocious, and talented 18-year-old girl, called Regine Olsen,

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.780
only then to break off the engagement as he realized

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.700
that to try and live with her forever would also mean killing the love that had drawn him to her.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:00.080
Everywhere he turned, Kierkegaard saw intolerable incompatibilities, and impossible choices.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.620
It led him to one memorable explosion in "Either/Or":

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.720
"Marry and you will regret it. Don't marry; you will also regret it."

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.800
"Marry or don't marry; you will regret it either way."

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.540
"Laugh at the world's foolishness; you will regret it."

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.080
"Weep over it; you'll regret that too."

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.340
"Hang yourself; you'll regret it. Don't hang yourself and you'll regret that too."

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.640
"Whether you hang yourself or don't hang yourself, you will regret both."

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.160
"This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy."

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.600
The mention of laughter is not a coincidence; key to Kierkegaard's philosophy is that:

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.000
the only intelligent tactical response to life's horror is to laugh defiantly at it.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.060
Rarely has a philosopher taken humor as seriously.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.280
Kierkegaard is often described as the founder of the philosophical movement known as "existentialism",

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.240
because, in him, we find all the themes that would so interest later thinkers, like Sartre, Camus, and Heidegger.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:57.280
The book that fascinated the existentialists was Kierkegaard's, "The Concept of Anxiety", published in 1844,

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.320
in which he emphasized a new word, "angest", or "angst", as we know it in English,

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.300
a condition where we understand how many choices we face,

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.440
and how little understanding we can ever have of how to exercise these choices wisely.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.580
As Kierkegaard wrote, "Life can only be understood backwards, but must be lived forwards".

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:21.620
Our constant angst means that unhappiness is more or less written into the script of life,

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.320
as he wrote, "anyone who has given the matter any serious thought will know that I'm right when I say,"

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.000
"it's not possible for anyone to be absolutely, and in every conceivable way, completely content,"

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.120
"not even for a single half hour of his life."

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:43.220
"No one has come into the world without crying. No one asks when you want to enter the world; no one asks when you want to leave."

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:49.260
"How empty and meaningless life is; we bury a person, throw three shovels of earth over him,"

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.240
"drive out in a coach, drive back in a coach, and console ourselves that we still have life enough left to live."

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.480
"But really, how long is three score and ten; why not just get it over with straight away?"

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:07.280
For Kierkegaard there was, however, one answer that he put forward ever more stridently in his later works: Jesus Christ.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.080
Kierkegaard loathed the Christianity of the established Danish church,

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.840
but he adored the simple truths of the Gospels that his father taught him as a boy

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:22.160
For him, Christianity was a religion of extreme surrender to a theology of almost peasantlike simplicity:

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:30.240
one was to be ready to die for Christ, to give up all attachment to worldly things, and to love all humans like one's siblings.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.640
Kierkegaard wasn't interested in justifying his attachment to Christianity through rational means;

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.280
instead, he recommended a dramatic and now famous 'leap of faith',

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.520
wherein one wouldn't apply one's puny mind to attempting to prove the existence of God,

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:52.520
one would merely switch off one's faulty rational faculties, and jump into the idea of God as the total solution.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:59.200
As he put it, "To have faith is to lose your mind and to win God".

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.720
Like Marxist communism, Kierkegaard's solutions to the problems of being human

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:10.240
are far less convincing and interesting than the diagnoses of our ills; few of us now make that leap,

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:16.320
but Kierkegaard deserves our attention for the beautifully bitter, caustic look he casts on the human condition.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:22.200
He's one of the few philosophers one can turn to when the world has badly let us down, and we're in need of a friend

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:30.100
who can fully understand the dark places we're in once the sentimental illusions, that normally keep us going, fall away.
