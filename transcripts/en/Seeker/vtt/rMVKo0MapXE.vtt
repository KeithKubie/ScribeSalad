New research suggests "broken homes" may not
be broken, after all.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:14.119
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and we've
long been taught to believe that the nuclear

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:16.480
family is the key to long-term happiness.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.460
But a new study says that may not be entirely
true!

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.910
A group of researchers from the UK analyzed
data from over 12,000 7-year-old children,

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.269
and found that those living with a step-parent
or a single parent, were just as happy as

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.250
those living with two biological parents.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.160
Researchers separated the children into 3
different groups: those living with 2 biological

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.680
parents, those living with one biological
parent and one step-parent, and those living

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.320
with a single biological parent.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.719
After adjusting for factors like social class
and neighborhood affluence - researchers asked

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.850
the children to rate how happy they were,
by reporting they were either "happy all the

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.600
time" or happy "sometimes or never."

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.629
And the results were exactly the same for
all 3 groups: 36% of children said they were

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.910
happy 'all the time' and 64% said they were
happy 'sometimes or never.'

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:14.250
They even repeated the study for older children,
ages 11-15, and the results were almost exactly

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.250
the same.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.360
Jenny Chanfreau, the lead scientist on the
project, says this study proves it's not the

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.570
family composition that matters - but the
quality of the relationships at home.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.090
Factors like getting along with their siblings,
having friends, having fun with the family,

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.400
and not being bullied at school - were all
linked with a higher likelihood of being happy

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.400
all the time.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.530
I am sure this will come as a relief to some
of you single parents out there - so if your

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.510
child is unhappy - just remember.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.730
It's not all about you.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.120
And hey - while we're talking about kids,
did you know that auto accidents are the number

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.840
one killer of US teens?

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.730
It's a terrifying statistic, and that's why
Toyota is taking part in the Toyota Teen Driver

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:51.730
Video Challenge.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.660
A few weeks ago, they asked high school students
to submit short videos that promote safe driving,

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.510
and the judges have now narrowed it down to
the top 10 submissions.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:06.270
From now until April 30, you can go to toyotateendriver.com/vote
and vote every day for your favorite video.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.069
One grand prize winner will receive $15,000
and have their video re-shot by the Discovery

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.069
crew.

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.910
So head over toyotateendriver.com/vote - and
