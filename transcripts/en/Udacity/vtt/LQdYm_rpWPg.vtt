00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.990
Once you install Android Studio you can open it and check for

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:04.570
updates before proceeding.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.096
Looks like we have the latest version installed already, so

00:00:07.096 --> 00:00:08.191
we can close this dialog.

00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:11.960
We're going to be setting up a new project using Android Studio version 1.01.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.490
As you follow along, if things look differently on your computer, that's okay.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.410
It's probably because you're on a newer version of Android Studio.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.020
For the most up-to-date instructions on how to get started,

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.260
you can always check the instructor notes below.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.240
Now, let's click here to start a new Android Studio project.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.550
In the project wizard, we set the app name to be Sunshine.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.180
Then we provide a corresponding package name.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.570
The package name should be globally unique across all packages installed

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.540
on Android.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.900
To avoid conflicts,

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.970
use the reverse of the name of the internet domain that you own.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.520
This follows the Java package name conventions.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.620
We're using the combat example name space for

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.680
our Sunshine app because it's a sample.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.240
But you cannot publish an app on Google Play with that name space.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.840
Usually leaving the default package name is fine.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.270
However, this course was originally filmed with a older version of

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.110
Android Studio where the module name app was included by default.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.950
So, we'll edit the package name here, so

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.180
it matches what we had in the older version of Android Studio.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.920
For your code to match the rest of the code in this course,

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.960
you should add the dot app as well.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.800
Next, we choose our project location and then we can hit Next.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.400
Now we need to choose our minimum SDK version.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.940
In previous versions of Android Studio,

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.070
you would also have to select the target SDK.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.230
Now the project wizard automatically sets the target SDK

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.590
to the latest version of Android.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.850
Even though it's already selected for

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.480
you, it's important to know the distinction between minimum and target SDK.
