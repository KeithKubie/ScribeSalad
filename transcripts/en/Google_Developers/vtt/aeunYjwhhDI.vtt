00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.730
hi my name is Magnus I with the Google
Drive team

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.940
we're gonna look at the Asus WiFi-Go

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.199
technology which allows you to interact
with your Google Drive content

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:26.030
from anywhere and also remotely control
your computer. Let's have a look.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.680
People around the world manage their
files every day

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.310
share, store, email and collaborate

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.600
Do you carry it around with you? 
It's no longer an option

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.350
when data is so valuable. And how do you
manage backups?

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.809
Or, a real time collaboration? Recent
research shows that forty five percent

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:45.860
of the web users

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.410
use cloud storage. With so many cloud
storage options available though,

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.440
transferring files around can be a
hassle and time-consuming task

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.910
How to help users manage them is an
important topic

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.120
that developers have been working on for
some time. 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.340
Our users told us that they need a way to synchronize 
their stuff between different cloud services

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.630
we want to help them do all that and
even more

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.890
so we develop Cloud GO! as part of our
WiFi Go! package

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.979
to offer an integrated tool for both cloud
management and the media streaming

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.780
we want to make it easy, fast and reliable 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.120
and that's why Google Drive is our first
choice

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.570
Google Drive delivers the tool
that we need

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.760
to create a reliable integrated cloud storage

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.490
it also helps us to understand how Cloud Go!
is experienced by our users

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.840
so that we can continue with our passion
building the innovative features

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.870
and making them as good as they can
possibly be

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.979
In designing Asus software,

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.270
our goal was to make the behavior and interface

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.860
aw single and clean as possible. 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.810
Now we can see on the screen is our WiFi Go!
WiFi Go! is a free software utility

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.640
available on App Store and 
Google Play

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.880
We can see on the main menu here, it
includes many remote control features

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.420
such as multi-media streaming or Remote
Desktop to remote control your PC.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.610
Now let's have a look at Cloud Go!

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.100
so this is Cloud Go!'s main interface. On the
top are the basic functions, such as,

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.209
here you can browse and select files

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.830
to upload to storages.  

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.030
Download, create folders and editing which are all

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.930
easy to use. How to sync them all across

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.920
clouds or even backup? Simply click on
the files

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.739
and select the clouds you want and tick
backup to PC

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:01.470
then it's all done

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.730
Here you can see the data is also
stored in your PC at the same time

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.690
overall the application aims to provide
cloud

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.600
users an integrated platform to manage, sync

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.160
and backup files from one point to
another, providing greater benefit for you

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.459
in this new cloud storage era
