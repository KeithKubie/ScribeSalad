00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.562
I have a tendency

00:00:01.562 --> 00:00:04.094
to want to do a little bit of everything.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.320
Gymnastics,

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:06.355
music,

00:00:06.355 --> 00:00:07.349
comedy...

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:08.794
But, I'm starting to realize

00:00:08.794 --> 00:00:10.757
there are serious drawbacks

00:00:10.757 --> 00:00:13.195
to dabbling in too many hobbies.

00:00:13.195 --> 00:00:16.139
Because you get good at a bunch of random stuff,

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.350
but you don't get GREAT at any one thing.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.262
I was reading that it takes 10,000 hours,
roughly 10 years, of hard work and deliberate practice

00:00:25.262 --> 00:00:27.347
to become a master of something.

00:00:27.347 --> 00:00:28.956
And so it makes you wonder,

00:00:28.956 --> 00:00:30.348
what do you want to be great at?

00:00:30.348 --> 00:00:32.410
What do you want to be a master of?

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.578
And I decided...

00:00:33.578 --> 00:00:34.762
Storytelling.

00:00:34.762 --> 00:00:35.987
Because that emcompasses

00:00:35.987 --> 00:00:37.225
everything that I love.

00:00:37.225 --> 00:00:37.700
Acting,

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.097
Writing,

00:00:38.097 --> 00:00:38.757
Directing...

00:00:38.757 --> 00:00:40.726
I don't care, I just want to be a part of telling

00:00:40.726 --> 00:00:41.908
a great story.

00:00:42.685 --> 00:00:44.610
So, that's part of the reason

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.726
why I'm doing the minimum of 12 short films this year,

00:00:47.726 --> 00:00:49.758
not only is it a great education,

00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:51.486
but I feel like it'll really help me hone in

00:00:51.486 --> 00:00:53.227
on my focus and make me remember

00:00:53.227 --> 00:00:55.609
"No, THIS is what you wanna work on."

00:00:56.257 --> 00:00:57.141
Speaking of which,

00:00:57.141 --> 00:00:58.578
my first one came out last week!

00:00:58.578 --> 00:01:00.168
It's called "Hallucination,"

00:01:00.168 --> 00:01:01.910
and it's about a girl with schizophernia

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.486
who's stalked by a figment of her imagination.

00:01:04.486 --> 00:01:06.669
It was so much fun to film.

00:01:06.669 --> 00:01:07.519
Yeah!

00:01:07.879 --> 00:01:08.879
I'm on tape, tape!

00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:10.652
Such a great learning experience.

00:01:10.652 --> 00:01:12.324
I'm-I'm a director.

00:01:12.324 --> 00:01:15.169
And, I have this Satan-like footage

00:01:15.169 --> 00:01:16.625
for the rest of my life...

00:01:16.625 --> 00:01:20.109
(whispering)
Kill her, kill her, kill her...

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:22.078
(voice increases)
KILL HER, KILL HER, KILL HER....

00:01:22.078 --> 00:01:24.380
I will see you next week.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.986
Stay awesome, Gotham.

00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:27.589
AAAHH.
