metaphorically and I think that that's a

piece of it right i mean it's but it's
also<00:04:16.370><c> i</c><00:04:16.489><c> think</c><00:04:16.670><c> normalizing</c><00:04:17.660><c> that</c><00:04:17.930><c> piece</c><00:04:18.200><c> of</c>

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 align:start position:0%
also i think normalizing that piece of

also i think normalizing that piece of
learning<00:04:18.739><c> that</c><00:04:18.830><c> requires</c><00:04:19.190><c> you</c><00:04:19.370><c> to</c>

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 align:start position:0%
learning that requires you to

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 align:start position:0%
what's happening here i need to ask
 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:23.409 align:start position:0%
what's happening here i need to ask
questions<00:04:22.070><c> and</c><00:04:22.580><c> so</c><00:04:22.669><c> it</c><00:04:22.729><c> gives</c><00:04:22.820><c> you</c><00:04:22.970><c> a</c><00:04:23.030><c> vehicle</c>

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 align:start position:0%
questions and so it gives you a vehicle
 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:24.040 align:start position:0%
questions and so it gives you a vehicle
for<00:04:23.570><c> doing</c><00:04:23.810><c> that</c>

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 align:start position:0%
for doing that
 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.990 align:start position:0%
for doing that
and<00:04:24.379><c> it</c><00:04:24.470><c> ties</c><00:04:24.710><c> it</c><00:04:24.919><c> a</c><00:04:24.979><c> little</c><00:04:25.099><c> more</c><00:04:25.280><c> directly</c><00:04:25.699><c> to</c>

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
and it ties it a little more directly to
 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.089 align:start position:0%
and it ties it a little more directly to
what<00:04:26.900><c> you've</c><00:04:27.050><c> just</c><00:04:27.080><c> learned</c><00:04:27.379><c> right</c><00:04:27.949><c> so</c>

00:04:28.089 --> 00:04:28.099 align:start position:0%
what you've just learned right so
 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:29.469 align:start position:0%
what you've just learned right so
there's<00:04:28.250><c> that</c><00:04:28.310><c> close</c><00:04:28.550><c> relationship</c><00:04:29.240><c> to</c><00:04:29.389><c> I've</c>

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 align:start position:0%
there's that close relationship to I've
 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
there's that close relationship to I've
just<00:04:29.629><c> had</c><00:04:29.750><c> this</c><00:04:29.870><c> practice</c><00:04:30.379><c> things</c><00:04:30.919><c> unclear</c><00:04:31.250><c> I</c>

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 align:start position:0%
just had this practice things unclear I
 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.830 align:start position:0%
just had this practice things unclear I

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
can get that information out and then
 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.020 align:start position:0%
can get that information out and then
hopefully<00:04:33.349><c> benefit</c><00:04:33.710><c> from</c><00:04:33.860><c> faculty</c><00:04:34.430><c> yeah</c><00:04:35.000><c> I</c>

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 align:start position:0%
hopefully benefit from faculty yeah I
 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.779 align:start position:0%
hopefully benefit from faculty yeah I
