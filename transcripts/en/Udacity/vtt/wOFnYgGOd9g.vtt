Using the skills we've covered
in this lesson you should now be

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.550
well equipped to implement a solid
focused strategy in your application.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.740
The next step is to take all these
various interactive controls that we've

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.280
been working with and
start to infuse them with some meaning.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.850
For instance, when a screen reader
lands on your custom radio buttons,

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.230
how is it going to tell the user that
these are in fact radio buttons.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.460
And not just a bunch of divs.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.800
For that, we're going to need
to learn about semantics.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.195
And I'm going to turn it over to
Alice to tell you all about it.
