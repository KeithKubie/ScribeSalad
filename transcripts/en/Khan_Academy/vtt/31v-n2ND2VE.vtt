00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.560
We're on problem 27.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.780
And the question is, which
equation best represents the

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.210
graph above?

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.420
So before even looking at the
choices, let's see what we can

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.390
figure out about the graph.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:12.830
So what's its y-intercept?

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.070
So if we said that this is the
equation of a line, we said y

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:23.340
is equal to mx plus b where m is
the slope and y is-- and b

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.110
is the y-intercept.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.780
It's late, I'm getting
slightly muddled.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:27.780
So what's the y-intercept?

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.530
Well when x is equal to
0, y is equal to 0.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.990
So this is going to
be equal to 0.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.510
The y-intercept is 0.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.310
When x is equal to 0,
why is equal to 0.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.190
So the y intercept is 0.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.580
So we know that this has a form
y is equal to mx where m

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.840
is a slope.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.810
Let's figure out the slope.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.430
Slope is equal to change in y
for a given change in x or

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.015
change in y over change in x.

00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:54.930
So when we increase x by 1, how
much are we increase-- or

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.970
decrease y by?

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.270
Well then y increases by 2.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.650
So we could say that equals y
changes by 2, by plus 2 when x

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.610
changes by plus 1.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.430
So we get the slope is equal to
2, so the equation of this

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.740
line is y is equal to 2x.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.840
Which is choice B.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.240
Next problem.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.690
Which point lies on the line
defined by 3x plus

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.470
6y is equal to 2?

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.410
Well the best thing to do is
just probably to substitute

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.990
these numbers in for x and y
and see which one works.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.430
So here x is 0, y is 2.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.780
So let's see.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:40.660
3 times 0 plus 6 times 2
is equal to 0 plus 12.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.900
Doesn't equal 2, it equals 12.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.590
This one doesn't work.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.610
I'm just taking 3 times
x plus 6 times y and

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:47.750
seeing what it equals.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.080
In this case, we have 3 times
0 plus 6 times y.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.800
Plus 6 times 6.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.040
Well that's 0 plus 36.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.600
That doesn't equal 2.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.420
Can't be that choice.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.000
This one, we have 3,
this 3, times 1.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.789
Plus 6 times this y.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.530
6 times minus 1/6.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.260
So let's see.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.040
That's 3.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.350
That's equal to 3.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.510
And then, 6 times 1/6
is 1, but we have a

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.240
negative out there.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.340
So it's minus 1.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.170
That is equal to 2.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.210
So that works.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.690
3 times 1 plus 6 times negative
1/6 is equal to 2.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.190
So our answer is C.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.990
Problem 29.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.470
Let me see if I need to cut
and paste this one in.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.830
All right.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.390
So yeah, I think it's
a good idea.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.820
Let me see.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:45.900
Copy and paste it.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.690
Let me copy and paste the next
several problems. We could

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.820
just move-- be streamlined
about it.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.080
OK, they all fit.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.330
Good enough.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.530
What is the equation of the line
that has slope of 4 and

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.770
passes through the point
3 comma minus 10?

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.410
So if the slope is 4, we know
that the line-- so just

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.640
rewrite it in slope y-intercept
form again.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.170
mx plus b.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.930
They're telling us that
the slope is 4.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.260
So we know the equation of the
line is y is equal to 4x plus

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.760
the y-intercept.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.690
And then we could figure
out the y-intercept by

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.780
substituting in this point that
they say it goes through.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.660
So it goes through the point
3 comma negative 10.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.950
So y is equal to minus 10
when x is equal to 3.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.020
So 4 times x.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.250
x is equal to 3.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.230
Plus b.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.040
So what is that?

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.670
That's minus 10 is equal
to 12 plus b.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.660
We could subtract 12 from both
sides of this equation, and we

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.980
get minus 22.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.260
Minus 10 minus 12 is minus 22.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.710
This 12 obviously goes away.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:05.830
Is equal to b.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.920
So the equation of our line is y
is equal to 4x plus b, which

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.120
we just figured out
is minus 22.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.019
4x minus 22.

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.060
That's choice A.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:25.380
Problem 30.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.270
The date in the table show the
cost of renting a bicycle by

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.800
the hour, including a deposit.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.090
If hours, h, were graphed on the
horizontal axis-- let me

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.380
see if I can draw that.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:45.010
So that is on the horizontal
axis I have hours, h.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.160
So this is h.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.950
And costs were graphed on the
vertical axis, so let me draw

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.200
the vertical axis.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.030
So cost is on the
vertical axis.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.390
What would be the equation of
the line that fits the data?

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.970
OK, so they just want to know
cost as a function of hours.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.160
So let's see.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.210
It's a linear relationship.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.170
We could treat this just
like any other line.

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.100
So if we write it as
y equals mx plus b.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.060
I didn't even have to do this.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.300
So y is equal to mx plus b.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.450
So m, or the slope, is equal to
change in y over-- or let

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:24.890
me write it differently.

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.130
Because we want it in terms of--
so we could write c is

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.940
equal to the slope times
the hours plus b.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.580
Instead of x, we have hours, and
instead of y, we have the

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.730
cost.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.210
So what's the slope?

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.470
Slope is equal to change in the
dependent variable, change

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.840
in cost, divided by change in
the independent variable,

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.932
divided by change in hours.

00:05:49.932 --> 00:05:52.410
So let's see.

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.350
If when our hours increased
by 3, how much did our

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.450
change in c go by?

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:03.390
When we go from 2 to 5, so if
we say 5 minus 2, that's how

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.030
much we changed in hours.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.610
That's delta h.

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.100
Then how much did we
change in cost?

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.590
Well it's 30 minus 15.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.860
So it equals 15 over 3.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.780
which is equal to 5.

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.390
So we figured out the slope.

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.330
Slope is equal to 5.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.130
Now we just have to figure
out the y-intercept.

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.710
So this equation, we could
rewrite it as cost is equal to

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.700
the slope, which is 5, times
the hours plus whatever our

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:34.890
y-intercept is.

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:36.630
And then we just have to
substitute one of the points

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.460
in to solve for b, just like we
did in the previous video.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.570
So let's substitute the point
when h is equal to 2, c is

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:45.410
equal to 15.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.220
So the point 2 comma 15.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.710
So when h is equal to
2, c is equal to 15.

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:56.260
c is equal to 15 when
h is equal to 2.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.040
And now we can just
solve for b.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.000
So you get 15 is equal
to 10 plus b.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.050
Subtract 10 from both sides,
you get b is equal to what?

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.370
5.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:16.650
So the equation of this line is
cost is equal to 5 times h

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.860
plus our y-intercept, or plus
our c-intercept we could say.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.380
So plus 5.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:27.990
5h plus 5, and that
is choice C.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.200
And if you try it out
with these points,

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.940
it should all work.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.305
OK, next problem.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.410
Let me see.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:41.021
I think this cutting and
pasting works out well.

00:07:41.021 --> 00:07:43.220
I think I have time for
at least two more.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.760
OK, let me clear this.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.720
Clear this one right here.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.820
Let me paste it in.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:01.500
OK, it says, some ordered pairs
for a linear function of

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.790
x are given in the
table below.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:05.270
It's kind of like
the last one.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.400
Which of the following equations
was used to generate

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.850
the table above?

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:11.070
Well we could do the same thing
we did the last time.

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:13.500
We could say OK, this is going
to have some relation.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.750
You know y is equal
to mx plus b.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.350
It's going to be a line
and this is the

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.180
slope y-intercept form.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.670
And they tell us it's
the linear function.

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:23.280
So that's why we can immediately
say that's going

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:23.830
to be a line.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.910
There's no x squared or
anything like that.

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:30.980
So a good place to start
is just with the slope.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:37.570
So slope is equal to change
in y over change in x.

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:37.970
So let's see.

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:40.900
When x goes from 1 to 3,
what does y go for.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:44.090
It goes from 1 to 7.

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:48.830
So change in x is equal to
3 minus 1 or just 2.

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:50.980
And what's change in y?

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.230
7 minus 1.

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:58.680
So that is equal to
6 over-- oh, no.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:58.900
Sorry.

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.560
Change in x was 3 minus 1.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.140
Sorry about that.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.020
3 minus 1.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:08.290
So it's 6 over 2.

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:13.940
When x changes by 2-- that's
this 2, change in x-- y

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.090
changes by 6.

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:16.920
That's change in y.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.260
So the slope is 3.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:23.660
So the equation of our line is
going to be y is equal to 3x

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.900
plus some y-intercept.

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.660
And now we could substitute
some points in.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:28.490
Let's substitute this one.

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:29.670
This 1, 1 seems easy.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:33.530
So y is equal to 1 when
x is equal to 1.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:40.010
So we get 1 is equal
to 3 plus b.

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:44.930
Subtract 3 from both sides of
this equation and we get what?

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:48.180
1 minus 3 is minus 2 is equal
to-- obviously, this

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.280
disappears, 3 minus 3.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.450
So b is equal to minus 2.

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:54.760
So the equation of our line,
we have a slope of 3 and a

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.080
y-intercept of minus 2.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:01.840
The equation is going to be
y is equal to 3x plus b.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.960
Well b is minus 2.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.130
So minus 2.

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:06.940
And that is choice C.

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:14.730
32.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:18.870
The equation of line l is
6x plus 5y equals 3.

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:24.570
And equation of line q is 5x
minus 6y is equal to 0.

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:27.070
Which of the statements about
the two lines are true?

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:27.820
OK, let's see.

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.360
They have the same
y intercept.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.220
They're parallel.

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:33.050
They have the same
x-intercept.

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:36.510
Lines l and q are
perpendicular.

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:38.970
Well I'll tell you how you can
identify perpendicular lines.

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:41.470
They have the negative inverse
of each other's slope.

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:43.710
But I don't know if that's going
to come into play yet.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:47.960
I always find it easier to look
at these lines in kind of

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.310
the slope y-intercept form.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:49.940
So let's do that.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:57.540
So line l can be 6x plus
5y is equal to 3.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:01.160
So if we were to subtract 6x
from both sides you get 5y is

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.560
equal to minus 6x plus 3.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.300
And then you divide both sides
by 5 and you get y is equal to

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:14.160
minus 6/5 x plus 3/5.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.380
So this is line l right here.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.100
I'll do line q in a
different color.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:27.180
So q is 5x minus 6y
is equal to 0.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.580
So let's subtract 5x
from both sides.

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:35.080
You get minus 6y is
equal to minus 5x.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:39.760
If you divide both sides by
negative 6, you get y is equal

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.000
to-- minus 5 divided
by negative 6.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.010
That's 5/6 x.

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:48.470
Well, it actually looks like
D comes into play.

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:52.060
Because the slope of this
one is minus 6/5.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.110
That's the slope of line l.

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:59.620
The slope of line q is the
inverse of that made negative.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.390
At this point it's a good
thing to memorize.

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:04.580
I haven't proven
it to you yet.

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:07.670
If you want a line that has a
slope perpendicular to this

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:10.590
one, or a line that is
perpendicular to this one will

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:12.470
have a negative inverse slope.

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:16.630
So the inverse of this is minus
5/6 and the negative

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:19.030
inverse is plus 5/6.

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.650
So this is the negative
inverse of that.

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:24.520
So these lines are actually
perpendicular.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.740
So that is D.

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:29.560
See you in the next video.
