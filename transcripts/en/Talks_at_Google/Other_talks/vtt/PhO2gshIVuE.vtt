00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.920
&gt;&gt;presenter: Good afternoon, everyone. Let's
get started. It's an honor introducing, hosting

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.700
Khan Academy today, here at Google. We have
three wonderful guests here. Sal, who's the

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.400
founder, and Shantanu, who is the President
and COO, and Marcia, who is a software engineer

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.011
of Khan Academy. I learned about Khan Academy
about a year ago. I wasn't sure how, just,

00:00:27.011 --> 00:00:32.960
it also comes with a lot of comments, also
like people appreciating. I wasn't sure just

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.890
how this video is going to be theoretical
as far as personal education is concerned.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.579
So I tried it myself and I guess the first
thing that I noticed was that it almost seems

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.980
that he was having more fun teaching me than
I was having fun listening to him. [audience

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.550
laughter] He is so passionate about teaching.
And I intentionally chose a non-technical

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.940
topic, which I always hated, like history.
And I watched through all the videos and it

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.089
was just like glass and ice. At a very certain
level, I realized why it works. With that,

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:08.390
I will actually give it to Chris Uhlik. He
will formally introduce Sal. He has been working

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.620
with Khan Academy over the past year and he
has actually helped them get a $50,000 grant

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.140
from Microsoft Research and he also helped
them get two million dollars from Google,

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.189
as part of the 10 to the 100th Project. So,
with that, I'll give it to Chris.

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.420
[applause]

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:33.159
&gt;&gt;Chris Uhlik: Hey, so, I have four children,
ages eight through fifteen, and we homeschool

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.619
them. My wife is very interested in education
technology. She has a degree in education

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.649
technology and it's illegal to experiment
on humans, so she made her own.

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.649
[laughter]

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:51.799
And we've been basically educating our kids
using 100 percent online materials. Every

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.590
kid's got a computer; they spend all day at
the computers and then they go off to physical

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.979
education classes outside the home and stuff
like that. So, she's a great student of what

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:08.870
kind of education technologies are out there
in the world. We buy everything; she researches

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:13.280
everything well. Just over two years ago,
she sent me a link to this Khan Academy. She

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.391
said, "Hey, check this out. This one's pretty
cool and itís free." And I started watching

00:02:18.391 --> 00:02:24.690
a few videos. I watched the banking crisis
explanation videos. And I was like, "This

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.120
stuff is really, really good." And I had been
thinking about what are a few of the really

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.470
big, high impact projects we can do in the
world, like fixing carbon dioxide emissions,

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:43.160
educating the people in the world. These are
some of the huge problems where you can really

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:50.520
totally transform the future. And I firmly
believe that doing this for free, so that

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.420
everybody in the world has access to education
materials, by taking advantage of the leverage

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.880
that technology offers, the ability to take
one lecture given by one guy and then have

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.620
a 100,000 people watch it over the next few
months. And Sal's done 18 hundred little capsule

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.870
lectures and they have a typical number of
views--around a hundred thousand each--40

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:19.640
thousand here, a million there, give or take.
So, he's reaching, right now, about two million

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.640
people a day.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.120
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: A month, unique a month.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.620
&gt;&gt;Chris: Unique a month. The University of
California has .2 million, right? So, he's

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.190
reaching ten times the University of California
with his own efforts, a few people helping

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:40.750
him, and a free video hosting service, right?
So that's the power of technologies like YouTube

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:48.560
and AppEngine to let people build incredibly
impactful, valuable things for free. So, a

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.490
year ago, I was working on this education
project. It wasn't Microsoft Research that

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.250
gave him the 50K, by the way. It was Google
Research.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.250
[laughter]

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:08.050
And I also helped the Google 10 to the 100
team decide and figure out how to give them

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.850
one fifth of the total prize, which is two
million dollars. And I think he's gotten some

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:21.000
significant backing from the Gates Foundation
and from John and Ann Doerr, and a few others.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.790
So, he's able now to really commit full-time
and actually hire people and expand and he's

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.660
getting some serious publicity help. That
publicity has caused him to grow a factor

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:39.630
of 50 in the past year. He was getting something
like, 40,000 views a month a year ago; he's

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.370
getting two million a month right now. And
that's just incredible and it's probably going

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:50.460
to continue accelerating at that kind of pace
for a while. You can look forward to most

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.110
people on the planet having seen a Khan Academy
video in the next couple of years. That's

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:02.590
impact. So, we're gonna start the talk. There's
a Dory page at go/khanacademy. There's gonna

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.900
be a lot of kind of question and answer period
at the end. There's a microphone in the middle.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:15.560
Go up and ask your questions at the end. Don't
interject and I'd like to introduce the Linus

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.830
Torvalds of education.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:17.830
&gt;&gt; Salman Khan: [laughs]

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:18.830
[audience laughter]

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.380
He's gonna transform the operating system
of the education future. Salman Khan.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.380
[laughter]

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.680
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: Thank you, thank you.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.680
[applause]

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.410
Actually ñ I don't want to be -- how many
of you all saw the Ted talk that came out

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.890
a week or so ago? Ok, I don't wanna bore y'all,
but some of y'all haven't seen it, but there

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.540
will be a little bit of an overlap. And since
you don't know the structure of this, I'm

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.090
gonna do a quick overview and feel free to
interrupt me at any time, or ask a question.

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:47.160
And then we'll just open up to Q&amp;A cause that'll
be more fun. We'll learn things. But just

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.610
to start off, as Chris mentioned, Khan Academy
started off me making videos. So, I'll show

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.390
yíall a little bit of a video montage to
see a feel for what the videos are like, and

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.380
we'll show you what else we're up to.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.380
[pause]

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.380
[video plays]

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:07.300
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan:(speaking on video) So, the
hypotenuse is going to be five. This animal's

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.360
fossils are only found in this area of South
America; nice, clean band here and this part

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:17.500
of Africa. We can integrate over the surface,
and the notation usually is a capitol sigma.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.570
National Assembly that create The Committee
of Public Safety, which sounds like a very

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:27.540
nice committee. Notice, this is an aldehyde
and it's an alcohol. Start differentiating

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:32.440
into effector and memory cells. A galaxy.
Hey, there's another galaxy. Oh, look, there's

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:37.470
another galaxy. And for dollars is their 30
million plus the 20 million dollars from the

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:44.310
American manufacturer. If this does not blow
your mind, then you have no emotion.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:45.310
[laughter]

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:46.860
[end video clip]

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.780
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: So, that's a feel for what
we're doing. And as Chris mentioned, we are

00:06:51.780 --> 00:07:02.139
now -- there's now on the order of 2200 videos.
I made five this morning. And they're--

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:03.139
[laughter]

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:07.400
ten minutes, you know. And they now cover
everything from basic arithmetic all the way

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.023
to vector calculus and the French Revolution,
and all the rest. And we're reaching -- actually

00:07:11.023 --> 00:07:16.480
a month ago, we were reaching a million unique
students a month. Now, weíre reaching two

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:21.430
million unique students a month just with
the latest buzz. So that's kind of where we

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.740
are now, but there's a lot more that we're
up to. Yíall have very generously given us

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.540
two million dollars, so I view this as a progress
report.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:28.540
[laughter]

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:36.460
But before I go into that, I'll talk a little
bit about how I got started. And as yíall

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:40.990
know, I was a hedge fund analyst five years
ago in Boston. Then, we moved the firm out

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:45.120
here in Northern California. It was actually
a two-person hedge fund and my boss -- his

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:51.540
wife became a professor at Stanford, so he
moved to Palo Alto. And I was tutoring my

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:56.081
cousins remotely in New Orleans and started
working with one cousin, then another cousin,

00:07:56.081 --> 00:07:59.900
then another cousin. Before I knew it, I had
this cohort of cousins all over the country

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:04.270
and I was looking for a way to scale myself
up. And one of my buddies [Sulfaka Ramzana]--I

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:09.270
should give him credit--I was literally hanging
out at his house, showing him how I was tutoring

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:12.901
my cousins and all that, and he's like, "You
know, why don't you put some of your lectures

00:08:12.901 --> 00:08:16.860
on YouTube?" And I said, "Oh, that's silly.
YouTube's for dogs on skateboards. It's not

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:17.860
for--

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:18.860
[laughter]

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:26.190
It's not for a serious learning. But once
I got over the idea that it wasn't my idea,

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:27.190
I--

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:28.190
[laughter]

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:34.579
said, "I'll take a shot at it." And I remember
the first video, I think, and you can go there,

00:08:34.579 --> 00:08:38.930
literally, it's like November 6th, 2006. It
was greatest common divisor, least common

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:42.680
divisor. One of those. I wanted to teach my
cousins fractions. I was like, "Oh what do

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.930
they have to know? And the negative numbers."
And I put in like, 20 or 30 videos and this

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:50.611
has turned into a bit of a one-liner, but
it's true. The very first feedback my cousins

00:08:50.611 --> 00:09:00.530
gave me were that they preferred me on YouTube
than in person. And so, I felt like this was

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:04.730
something to do. So I kept making the videos.
I started getting feedback from people all

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:06.819
over the country, saying how it helped them.
"Hey, this helped me on my exam. I passed

00:09:06.819 --> 00:09:12.330
the exam." But some of them were like, "Hey,
I was gonna drop out of high school until

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:16.050
these videos". Or "This motivates me to go
to college and become an engineer." Or "This

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:20.350
is the only reason why I can, now that I'm
retiring from the military, I can feel comfortable

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:27.839
going back to the community college." So,
I was excited. So I kept going. And along

00:09:27.839 --> 00:09:32.149
the way, the site grew and then the other
thing that happened--actually this is what

00:09:32.149 --> 00:09:35.930
most people don't realize-- sometimes, I switch
around the story because it sounds better

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:39.839
when I started the videos. But I actually
started on the software side. If you rewind

00:09:39.839 --> 00:09:44.160
before I even wrote that first piece ñ I
recorded that first video, when I was tutoring

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:49.519
my cousins, I would just point them to random
websites. I was like, "Hey, I just found some

00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:52.769
website run by this university and there's
ten good problems on fractions. Why don't

00:09:52.769 --> 00:09:56.730
you do those problems and we'll go over them
tomorrow?" And the next day, I'd say, "Hey,

00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:00.829
now you do the problems?" She'd be like, "Yeah,
yeah, I did them." I was like, "How many did

00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:03.559
you get right?" She said, "Yeah, I think I
got them all right." I was like, "Oh, when

00:10:03.559 --> 00:10:07.439
did you do the problems?" "Oh, yeah, I did
'em like at night."

00:10:07.439 --> 00:10:08.439
[laughter]

00:10:08.439 --> 00:10:12.610
It wasn't that ñ it wasn't that informative.
So I was like, "Oh, I'm gonna write my own

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:14.889
problems." And then she would run out of problems.
There's these little worksheets that you see

00:10:14.889 --> 00:10:19.019
all over the web, like ten problems and then
you're done. So I wrote these really primitive

00:10:19.019 --> 00:10:25.189
JavaScript generate problems, as many as you
want, in adding fractions, or adding negative

00:10:25.189 --> 00:10:29.679
numbers, or multiplying fractions, or whatever.
And so that was -- the premise was, "I'll

00:10:29.679 --> 00:10:33.410
give you as many problems as you need until
you get ten in a row" and I'll show you what

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:40.180
they look like in a second, "and you'll get
hints for them." And before I even made the

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.880
first video, I thought that was the solution.
That was like, "this is all someone needs

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:49.110
to do math." Because on the exercises you
have hints and all of that. But then, once

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:54.160
the videos took off, it was just a better
use of my time to make five videos a day rather

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:59.560
than one module every five days. So, that
kind of ñ it got orphaned a little bit. And

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:03.829
actually, one thing that happened is, I left
it out there and I had this 50 dollar a month

00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:08.929
webhosting and at some point, there were too
many people using that software, so I just

00:11:08.929 --> 00:11:14.959
turned it off -- which is probably a bad idea
if you're ever starting a business. [laughter]

00:11:14.959 --> 00:11:20.180
It's probably a signal that you shouldn't.
Maybe spend a hundred dollars on your webhosting.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:26.179
So when the opportunity -- once Khan Academy
started growing, we had this viewership and

00:11:26.179 --> 00:11:29.689
it seemed like there was an organization that
we could start here. The question was like,

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:34.350
"How do you take what we're doing to the next
level?" And that's what ñ [pause] And that's

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:39.759
what I wanna show you right here. So, these
are the exercises and what I started with

00:11:39.759 --> 00:11:43.139
my cousin was a much more primitive version,
but this is the same, actually some of the

00:11:43.139 --> 00:11:48.250
same basic code. It's been fancied up a good
bit now. But the general principle is, it'll

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:51.449
give you as many--this is subtraction one--it'll
give you as many problems as you need until

00:11:51.449 --> 00:11:56.379
you get ten in a row. And it's a very simple--it
got cut off here-- but you can have the videos

00:11:56.379 --> 00:12:00.759
here, there's hints, you can see it draws
a number line for you. The Khan Academy videos

00:12:00.759 --> 00:12:04.950
can be pumped in, and itís a very simple
idea; you do it until you get ten in a row,

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:10.389
but itís--at least in our minds--completely
different than what happens right now in a

00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:14.329
traditional school. In a traditional school,
lecture, homework, lecture, homework, lecture,

00:12:14.329 --> 00:12:18.760
homework, lecture, homework, then snapshot
exam. And regardless of whether you get 80

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:22.809
percent, 90 percent, or 95 percent, the whole
class moves on. Even if you fail an exam,

00:12:22.809 --> 00:12:27.040
actually, the whole class will move to the
next topic and what was that five, twenty,

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.972
or thirty percent you didn't know? It was
probably something that you actually probably

00:12:29.972 --> 00:12:34.769
need for the next topic, or definitely something
you'll need in a few years. And there's no

00:12:34.769 --> 00:12:39.179
-- people just ignore it. They place a label
on your head; that some kind of value judgment

00:12:39.179 --> 00:12:43.620
on whether you're smart or not and then everyone
just proceeds down with those gaps. And so,

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.610
what we're saying is, "No, we're gonna have
them do the opposite." Instead on penalizing

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:50.829
you for failure and not expecting mastery,
we wanna do the opposite. We wanna allow you

00:12:50.829 --> 00:12:53.959
to experiment. If you're learning ñ if you're
learning to ride a bicycle, you would just

00:12:53.959 --> 00:12:58.341
sit on that bicycle as long as it takes to
actually learn how to ride the bicycle. And

00:12:58.341 --> 00:13:00.579
so, that's what we wanna do here. We wanna
allow you to experiment, we wanna allow you

00:13:00.579 --> 00:13:05.499
to fail, but you're not going to move on to
more advanced topics until you actually, until

00:13:05.499 --> 00:13:14.160
you actually master the topic. So this is
-- that is the subtraction one module. This,

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:21.179
right here, is trigonometry. [pause] This,
right here, is shifting and reflecting functions.

00:13:21.179 --> 00:13:29.529
And then this is how all of the exercises
are structured. So literally, this node right

00:13:29.529 --> 00:13:35.529
up there is single-digit addition. It's literally
five plus seven, or one plus one. And once

00:13:35.529 --> 00:13:41.160
you get ten in a row there, it'll move you
up to one digit and a double digit addition,

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:45.100
and then single digit subtraction and then
we call it very basic multiplication. Once

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:48.809
you get ten in a row there, it keeps moving
you down what we call this "knowledge map"

00:13:48.809 --> 00:13:54.569
and if you keep going down the knowledge map,
you start getting into some more advanced

00:13:54.569 --> 00:14:01.259
arithmetic; some pre-algebra here. Go further
down and it starts getting into algebra, a

00:14:01.259 --> 00:14:06.449
little bit of trigonometry, geometry, and
precalculus. And so, the general idea is that

00:14:06.449 --> 00:14:11.589
we want this graph to eventually cover everything.
Actually, the funding that yíall have given

00:14:11.589 --> 00:14:16.399
us, roughly half the funding is to translate
the videos into ten languages, but the other

00:14:16.399 --> 00:14:20.829
half of the funding is to build out this graph
structure to cover on the order of about two

00:14:20.829 --> 00:14:25.079
hundred or three hundred modules. So, literally
is all of K through calculus mathematics.

00:14:25.079 --> 00:14:31.019
But the goal, and it's already pretty good
coverage for K through nine, or K through

00:14:31.019 --> 00:14:36.290
ten mathematics, but the goal is right now,
it's about 107 modules. The K through calculus

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:40.389
is probably gonna be on the order of about
300 modules; totally very comprehensive. But

00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:44.009
there's no reason why you can't expand from
this into logic, into computer programming,

00:14:44.009 --> 00:14:49.939
into genetics, into probability, into finance,
into accounting, into grammar and logic. You

00:14:49.939 --> 00:14:53.620
can just keep building off of this knowledge
map, so it really covers everything that can

00:14:53.620 --> 00:15:00.879
be quizzed in this type of a form factor.
[pause] And so, this is just some more of

00:15:00.879 --> 00:15:06.069
it right over here. And so the paradigm that
we're doing -- when I started this, I assumed

00:15:06.069 --> 00:15:11.540
it would be a kind of a nice to have -- a
supplement for people. Even when we started,

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:14.790
when we formally became an organization, we
didn't assume that it would be adopted in

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:18.519
schools. But then, one thing that happened
was that teachers started adopting it on their

00:15:18.519 --> 00:15:22.299
own; just the videos. We started getting letters
from teachers saying, "Hey, you've already

00:15:22.299 --> 00:15:26.819
given the lecture, so we're using those to
flip the classroom. So instead of me giving

00:15:26.819 --> 00:15:31.139
the lecture ñ me the teacher -- , I'm assigning
your lectures as homework. And then what used

00:15:31.139 --> 00:15:36.720
to be homework, I'm having the students do
in the class." And it's a very simple concept,

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:41.119
but it really changes what a class is all
about then. Now, all of a sudden, instead

00:15:41.119 --> 00:15:45.199
of you literally have 30 people completely
silent and completely passive, most of them

00:15:45.199 --> 00:15:50.800
zoned out, a teacher having to give this one
size fits all lecture, even a great teacher,

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:56.059
they're losing probably two-thirds of the
class, now that happens at home. You don't

00:15:56.059 --> 00:15:59.139
have to be embarrassed to rewind and look
at something that you might have missed, or

00:15:59.139 --> 00:16:02.939
fast-forward if you're bored, or pause something
ten times; you don't have to interrupt the

00:16:02.939 --> 00:16:06.810
whole class. And now, when you actually go
to class, you actually have all of your peers,

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:10.710
you actually have the teacher to actually
help you out. And it's interesting. One thing,

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:17.290
and I had mentioned this is in the Ted Talk,
"that'll work for motivated students, but

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:20.529
what about the students who aren't going to
do that?" And I was like, "Well, if you're

00:16:20.529 --> 00:16:24.790
not gonna do anything at home, period, it's
still better that you're doing the exercises

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:27.730
in the classroom, because that's, frankly,
where you're gonna get most of the learning

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:31.680
in and if you didn't do it, watch the video
in the classroom, too. And so the paradigm

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.839
is, where you really learn stuff and where
you're really getting your head around something,

00:16:35.839 --> 00:16:40.129
you want other people to be around you. When
you're actually trying to solve the problem.

00:16:40.129 --> 00:16:44.709
But when you're trying to listen to a lecture,
you don't want people around you. You don't

00:16:44.709 --> 00:16:49.529
want your peer to say, "Oh my God, look how
stupid Sal is. I didn't have to pause that.

00:16:49.529 --> 00:16:52.259
He's reviewing stuff from 30 -- " You don't
want that around. So you want the lecture

00:16:52.259 --> 00:16:57.470
to be intimate, but you want the actual classroom
experience to be social. So what we're doing

00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:02.160
in classrooms now is taking that to the next
level. Los Altos, right here, they came to

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:09.140
us, they came to us actually about four months
ago. Shantanu and myself, we had a meeting

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:12.390
with their school board and said, "If you
just had carte blanche in a classroom, how

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:16.829
would you run the classroom?" And we said,
"Well, we would let every student work at

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:20.689
their own pace on those exercises on that
knowledge map we just showed you, and the

00:17:20.689 --> 00:17:23.750
teacher would walk in every day and just get
a dashboard that looks something like this."

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:29.269
And this is actually the live dashboard now
from Los Altos, just so you know how the story

00:17:29.269 --> 00:17:32.419
ends. "And the teacher would let -- everyone
would work at their own pace and only intervene

00:17:32.419 --> 00:17:37.470
on the kids who were stuck." And they said,
"Oh, that's a very radical approach." But

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:42.610
then, the next day they said, "Oh, we'll do
it." So, Los Altos, in November, they started

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:46.960
with two fifth grade classrooms and two seventh
grade classrooms, and this became ñ I would

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:51.639
say this became 50 to 60 percent of their
math curriculum, with the other forty percent

00:17:51.639 --> 00:17:55.600
being project-based learning. So they completely
gutted the traditional part of the curriculum;

00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:02.260
no more lectures, no more traditional homework,
no more of the lecture-homework-lecture-homework

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:07.269
cycle. Now, the students walk into class,
the teacher looks at a dashboard like this.

00:18:07.269 --> 00:18:11.299
Each row, here, is a student. I've blanked
them out for privacy. Each column, here, is

00:18:11.299 --> 00:18:15.820
one of those concepts you saw on that knowledge
map, and green means the students already

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:19.820
got ten in a row, blue means that they're
working on it, but no need to worry, and red

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:24.720
means that the student's stuck. So there could
be a kid working on third grade math in a

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.370
fifth grade classroom, and there is. That's
cool, as long as he or she isn't stuck. There

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:31.600
could be a kid working on trigonometry in
the fifth grade classroom, and that actually

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:36.049
is happening. And it's actually entertaining
because a reporter who asked the girl, she

00:18:36.049 --> 00:18:39.380
was literally doing trigonometry and she's
a fifth grader and she's like, "Do you think

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:46.070
this is fifth grade math?" And she's like,
"No. I think it's sixth grade."

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:47.360
[laughter]

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:52.260
But that's cool. They should both be working
on those respective concepts because that's

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:56.850
where they are. But, the teacher just works
on whoever is stuck, or even better, get one

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:59.590
of the kids who are already proficient in
that module, who've already gotten ten in

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:02.909
a row, let them be the first line of attack
and actually tutor their peers. And we all

00:19:02.909 --> 00:19:06.059
know when you actually tutor someone, there's
a whole other level of learning that's going

00:19:06.059 --> 00:19:11.190
to happen when you do that. And the teacher
only intervened -- and so, every moment of

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:16.159
a teacher's time is actually spent on being
a human; being ñ kind of interacting with

00:19:16.159 --> 00:19:20.590
the classroom. I've mentioned this in other
talks is that whenever people talk about technology,

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:26.299
they assume its like, "OK, it's probably good
for economics. It's probably good to get more

00:19:26.299 --> 00:19:29.899
bang for your buck, but it's probably gonna
dehumanize the classroom." And the one thing

00:19:29.899 --> 00:19:33.580
we keep saying is, "No, itís the complete
opposite. When you do something like this

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:36.601
in a traditional classroom, only about five
percent of a teacher's time is actually being

00:19:36.601 --> 00:19:40.590
a human being, actually sitting down next
to someone and tutoring them, mentoring them,

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:44.059
or working with them. Now, a hundred percent
of their time is." So, when you're using technology,

00:19:44.059 --> 00:19:47.200
you're actually humanizing the classroom by,
if you believe those numbers and I actually

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:55.580
think the five percent was generous, by a
factor of 20. And so, we don't want, even

00:19:55.580 --> 00:20:00.790
when I worked with my cousin, Nadia, and even
when I had the data on ---, I would ask her,

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:04.760
"Did you get this? Did you understand this?"
And she's like, "Oh, yeah, I got it. I got

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:09.100
it." There's these very painful discussions
that you have if you ever tried tutoring anybody

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:12.980
on what they do get and what they don't get.
And so, we wanted to avoid the teacher having

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:18.309
to do those really painful, awkward questions.
And so, we're trying to arm the teachers with

00:20:18.309 --> 00:20:21.730
as much data as possible. So this is like
ñ this is one of the views. A student can

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:25.750
view this about him or herself, or a teacher
or parent can see this about any of their

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:29.020
students. And this is just one of the reports;
we have a bunch of them. But this is literally

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:32.200
just the activity for the student over the
last 30 days. You could see it over the last

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:36.210
day, you could see it by hour, you can see
it over the last year. But each of these bars,

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:40.850
these are on a certain day. The light blue
is the time spent on exercises. The navy blue

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:45.820
is the time spent on videos. These are the
highest achievements achieved that day. And

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:50.399
if the student or the teacher, they scroll
over any of this, they actually see exactly

00:20:50.399 --> 00:20:54.350
the student spent 38 minutes on exercises;
they got that many energy points. These are

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:57.120
their achievements. The videos would be there
if they watched videos that day, and we're

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.610
actually even tracking when they pause the
videos, when do they repeat the videos. We're

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:03.890
gonna start using that. One, for the teacher
to know what happened, but also even for us

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:11.610
to know how can we, how can we improve our
videos. [pause] One report that teachers ask

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:13.850
us is -- they said, "Look, it looks like some
of the kids are really focused and they're

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:17.289
moving ahead, while some kids are jumping
around a lot. Can we have a report on focus?"

00:21:17.289 --> 00:21:23.360
And we said, "Sure." So, this is, this is
the focus report. The outer circle is literally

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:27.950
a pie chart of what exercises students spent
time on. This inner circle is where they spent

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:32.850
on videos. And, once again, if you scroll
over any of it, you get more detail on exactly

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:39.950
what the student was up to. [pause] This right
here just shows how granular the data is.

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:44.039
This is a student who is doing the probability
one module. So, a teacher can go and say,

00:21:44.039 --> 00:21:47.039
"OK, this is the first problem; they got it
right. That's why it's blue. They probably

00:21:47.039 --> 00:21:51.269
guessed because they spent like, four seconds
on it. And they watched the video. Then they

00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:55.650
got the next one wrong, a couple right, maybe
guessed. Wrong, wrong. It looks like whenever

00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:58.030
they actually made an effort on the problem,
they got it wrong and then they guessed a

00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:59.030
few right.

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:00.450
[laughter]

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:03.710
Then they used a hint. And if you click, if
a teacher actually, if a student, later, when

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:07.100
they see this on their report and they click
on any of these, they see the exact problem

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:10.639
that they didn't get right. And then, you
can eventually see-- and this was so funny--it

00:22:10.639 --> 00:22:13.460
got clipped off here, but you can see the
student eventually getting ten in a row. And

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:17.820
it's fun; you can almost see them thinking.
There's some deep thought going on the 99th

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:22.549
problem, where the student said, "No, I'm
gonna get my streak now." And so, he or she

00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:26.409
literally got this problem right, and then
you can actually see that they get faster

00:22:26.409 --> 00:22:29.679
and faster and then they get ten in row. So,
you can actually see the learning process.

00:22:29.679 --> 00:22:39.650
[pause] And most people ñ when you say "self-paced
learning" sounds like a good idea, but the

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:43.360
one thing that we're seeing over and over
again. And this goes back to ñ I -- there's

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.340
literally in one of the fifth grade classrooms,
in Los Altos, there's a few kids doing third

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:52.100
grade math and there's a few kids doing even
calculus. And there's a huge temptation when

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:57.470
you see that. "Oh. Gifted kids, remedial kids.
But it's cool. They can be in the same classroom,

00:22:57.470 --> 00:23:01.669
but those kids are gifted, those kids are
remedial. Those kids are not gonna be at Google,

00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:06.480
these kids are. I mean that's the -- we all
do that. When you see that, you just think

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.560
that. We're so used to labeling people. But
one thing we're seeing over and over again,

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:14.250
we've seen it at Los Altos, we're seeing it
in other summer camps we've run, is that some

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:20.940
subset of those kids--five days into it--there's
this spread. This is just days into the pilot.

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:24.711
This is the modules completed. Some days into
it, there's a group that clusters here and

00:23:24.711 --> 00:23:27.080
you can see that group here and there's a
group that clusters here. These are the gifted

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:31.429
students in a traditional system; these would
be the slow students. But you always see these

00:23:31.429 --> 00:23:35.370
students, once they spend extra time on some
module, and they get some core weakness out

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:38.889
of the way, and you don't know who they are
ñ you really don't ñ you have no idea; they

00:23:38.889 --> 00:23:43.440
just rocket forward. Everything else just
starts to click and so, in a matter of six

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.259
weeks, we've seen this flipping multiple times
of the students that you used to think were

00:23:46.259 --> 00:23:49.652
slow or remedial; they just had some basic
core weakness. And once you actually give

00:23:49.652 --> 00:23:53.350
them a change to get it out of the way, they
just rocket ahead. I mean, this kid right

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:57.039
here, literally, I think he's our number one
or number two kid in the class, and starting

00:23:57.039 --> 00:24:04.279
off, he was one of the worst. So you see this
over and over and over again. [pause] So that's

00:24:04.279 --> 00:24:11.440
the general idea of what we're up to. We can
address a lot more of it in the Q&amp;A, but our

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:17.409
goal is literally to be a free classroom for
the world; give a world-class education to

00:24:17.409 --> 00:24:21.779
anyone, anywhere. And I want to be careful.
We don't think we're doing that yet. We think

00:24:21.779 --> 00:24:27.929
we're solving parts of the problem. We have
the videos, we're doing the exercises, we're

00:24:27.929 --> 00:24:31.120
doing the data, we're doing the analytics,
we can kind of become a kind of operating

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:34.450
system for a classroom, but we think there's
a lot more and that's why itís fun to talk

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:38.139
to yíall because to some degree, we can even
brainstorm on what that would mean. But, I

00:24:38.139 --> 00:24:42.899
think it's completely possible that you can
have a reality where, in five or ten years,

00:24:42.899 --> 00:24:47.120
ideally you will have a classroom where you
will have a human being actually helping you

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:49.940
out. But there's a reality where even if you
don't have that, you can get a pretty darn

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:56.059
good education. So I'll open it up to questions.
Anyone who wants to walk up to the microphone,

00:24:56.059 --> 00:25:01.169
and if yíall, I guess there's that website
where people have ranked questions. [pause]

00:25:01.169 --> 00:25:04.309
I could ñ I'll take this one.

00:25:04.309 --> 00:25:08.159
&gt;&gt;audience #1: Hi. Thank you for coming. I
wanted to ask a question about if the model

00:25:08.159 --> 00:25:12.820
for the future is gonna be one like Wikipedia,
where you're gonna open up the creation of

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:17.779
the content, the videos, and the exercises?
And if so, how would you maintain the quality

00:25:17.779 --> 00:25:19.830
in those types of things?

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:23.940
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: Yeah. That's a great question.
The question is, will we open it up to kind

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:30.019
of be a Wikipedia of education as opposed
to -- and so, we're open to opening it up

00:25:30.019 --> 00:25:37.150
somewhat, but I think for video-based lectures,
if we just look at the video side, I think

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:40.600
the reason why I think that kind of crowd
sourcing doesn't work is because it's one,

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:44.809
your quality is gonna be all over the place.
And even if the quality is good, it would

00:25:44.809 --> 00:25:47.860
actually be very jarring. If I came and give
you -- imagine if you're in a math class and

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:50.840
I came and gave the first lecture, and then
the next day you have another good lecturer,

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:54.059
but you're like, "Who is this guy?" And then
the next day you have another lecturer. So

00:25:54.059 --> 00:25:57.309
there's actually this huge level of trust
that you have to build with the lecturer for

00:25:57.309 --> 00:26:02.350
you to be able to invest in more and more
watching. So, that's why we resist really

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:07.669
opening it up. We do suspect there's a whole
set of things that other people know that

00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:10.414
I could never know, or that would teach better
than me. Or maybe they'd teach the same thing

00:26:10.414 --> 00:26:14.429
that I'm teaching, but in a different way
that responds to other people. And so we are

00:26:14.429 --> 00:26:20.610
open to people. We're telling people, "Hey,
make 30 videos, 40 videos, 50 videos on a

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:24.570
certain topic." One, you should do it on your
own, cause you don't need us to broadcast

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:28.950
them, but if it really does feel the same,
it's consistent with our brand, we'd be open

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:29.950
to it.

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:30.950
&gt;&gt;audience #1: Thank you.

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:31.970
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: Yeah. I'll take--

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:33.010
&gt;&gt;presenter: [ ]

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:39.070
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: Top down. OK. I'll read this
first one. "With such busy schedules and varying

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:43.269
priorities, how are parents/students supposed
to identify online learning centers like Khan

00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:47.039
Academy that are legitimate academic institutes
and not just money-making schemes created

00:26:47.039 --> 00:26:53.929
to take advantage of the online trend?" One,
we're not-for-profit, so we're definitely

00:26:53.929 --> 00:26:58.049
not a money-making scheme, unless I got particularly
creative with the--

00:26:58.049 --> 00:26:59.259
[laughter]

00:26:59.259 --> 00:27:03.440
But we're not a money-making scheme. And actually,
that was, that was one of the main reasons

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:07.070
for being a not-for-profit. I mean, there's
a lot of people who talk about double bottom

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:11.070
line organizations which is an oxymoron. Bottom
line is meant to be literally the bottom line.

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:14.570
Like that's the thing that you care about.
And you can't say I care about two things

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:20.790
that are usually in opposition with each other.
So, if I was genuine, and I hope I am, about

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:24.380
-- no, the number one goal is not to become
rich, not to do whatever. The number one goal

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:30.149
is to provide an education for people; make
it a not-for-profit. And there's other realities

00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:35.090
that it actually has a better chance of becoming
a lasting institution then. If it's for-profit,

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:38.880
it'll be acquired by McGraw Hill at some point
and I'd buy a nice house, but that would be

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:43.970
the end of it. But here, there actually is
a potential to last potentially beyond me.

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:45.320
I'll take a question.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:52.360
&gt;&gt;audience #2: Yes. So one of the problems
I have is -- we run a training for our Google

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:56.419
partners -- it's technical training. We have
a classroom-based and it's like your model.

00:27:56.419 --> 00:28:00.470
We focus on getting the learning exercises;
walking around, helping them, get through

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:05.809
them covering the theory. And we have another
group of you who are ñ that can't come here

00:28:05.809 --> 00:28:06.809
for various reasons.

00:28:06.809 --> 00:28:09.190
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: Yeah. Yeah.

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:11.749
&gt;&gt;audience #2: I have problems getting them
to actually do the homework because that's

00:28:11.749 --> 00:28:18.080
where the learning, watch the tutorials, but
the homework pieces seems kind of ñ it drops

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.759
off. People are not that interested. What
kinds of things can you recommend?

00:28:20.759 --> 00:28:24.210
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: You know ñ I think ñ so -- to
get people to do the homework, I mean -- the

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:27.799
best way is just to track it. I mean, that
gives you information on whether they are

00:28:27.799 --> 00:28:28.821
or aren't doing the homework.

00:28:28.821 --> 00:28:30.769
&gt;&gt;audience #2: They're not submitting it,
so I know--

00:28:30.769 --> 00:28:33.820
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: Yeah, yeah. So, they're not
submitting it, so they're not doing it.

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:36.830
&gt;&gt;audience #2: And we have some carrots. We
have certifications and that's a big carrot

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:41.429
that we're seeing people completing the content.
But are there other, because people ñ there

00:28:41.429 --> 00:28:42.960
are competing events they have in their life.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:46.610
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: I think -- it's interesting
we had the gut sense that gamefying a lot

00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:50.730
of it, giving badges and points, and actually
I can even show you we have some of that over

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:59.721
here. We have some of these ñ we have some
of these badges right over here. So, gamefying,

00:28:59.721 --> 00:29:02.600
we thought it would be kind of a nice to have,
like it would make it kind of cool, but itís

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:04.580
amazing what's itís done. Oh -- it's not
on the screen now.

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:09.590
&gt;&gt;audience #2: Have you seen a lot more people
completing the content with the badges?

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:12.659
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: Yeah. It's great just changing
the amount of points you give for certain

00:29:12.659 --> 00:29:16.730
achievements or the wording has actually changed
like thousands of people's behaviors overnight.

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:20.659
Oh, yeah. There you go. Those are the badges.
So we just have a ton of these badges that

00:29:20.659 --> 00:29:25.649
we've set up and I was saying earlier at lunch,
in Los Altos, these are fifth graders. So,

00:29:25.649 --> 00:29:32.650
lemme show you there's a black hole badge
that right now, the black hole badge is -- we

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:37.999
have it defined. It's the most legendary badge
on the Khan Academy. It's actually impossible

00:29:37.999 --> 00:29:39.130
to get right now.

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:40.130
[laughter]

00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:45.499
Because we said no. That has to be -- once
we have three hundred modules, then you can

00:29:45.499 --> 00:29:48.370
only, if you get like, two hundred, we don't
even have that, so itís actually impossible

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:52.929
to get now. But the fifth graders became so
obsessed with getting--fifth gradersó with

00:29:52.929 --> 00:29:57.889
getting a black hole badge that some subset
of them went into our code, so itís an OpenSource

00:29:57.889 --> 00:29:58.889
project,

00:29:58.889 --> 00:29:59.889
[laughter]

00:29:59.889 --> 00:30:02.820
went into our code and figured out they had
to get 150, they told us, "Oh, we figured

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:05.649
out we have to get 150," and I'm like, "How
do you?" "The code."

00:30:05.649 --> 00:30:06.649
[laughter]

00:30:06.649 --> 00:30:13.139
So, itís amazing what, I mean, yíall should
be giving offers to those kids. I don't know

00:30:13.139 --> 00:30:14.139
what they're --

00:30:14.139 --> 00:30:15.139
[laughter]

00:30:15.139 --> 00:30:16.139
But itís amazing what this type of thing
does to motivate, especially kids. I don't

00:30:16.139 --> 00:30:17.139
know if it'll do it for employees.

00:30:17.139 --> 00:30:18.139
[laughter]

00:30:18.139 --> 00:30:20.480
&gt;&gt;audience #2: Thank you.

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:28.159
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: Yeah. Those, exactly. And I'll
take one from the -- I'll just read it. Where's

00:30:28.159 --> 00:30:35.139
the? [pause] Oh, there's not a, oh, these
are always the same. OK. "So you tend to focus

00:30:35.139 --> 00:30:39.070
on math, science, and economic concepts. What
do you think it would take to make this format

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:45.120
work for grammar, writing, or composition?"
So grammar, I think, is one that's very doable.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:49.929
I've tried to contact people who have good--I
won't name the companies--but there's a company

00:30:49.929 --> 00:30:52.440
out there that I think has a really good,
you know -- when I studied for the GMAT, I

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:55.330
used their book, and I was like, "I finally
learned grammar."

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:56.630
[laughter]

00:30:56.630 --> 00:31:03.289
And it might not be obvious, hearing me speak
now, but I just wanna find good materials.

00:31:03.289 --> 00:31:07.269
But, I think, grammar actually is perfect
for both the videos and for the exercises,

00:31:07.269 --> 00:31:13.499
because it is actually logical and very mathematical
to a large degree. And you can diagram things

00:31:13.499 --> 00:31:18.409
out. I think, one way or the other, writing
or composition, those will be interesting.

00:31:18.409 --> 00:31:21.880
I think writing and composition are much more
activity-based. You can't just have someone

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:25.529
give you a lecture on what it means. Although,
it would be probably ñ it would be interesting

00:31:25.529 --> 00:31:28.220
to have someone give a lecture. Maybe itís
me, maybe it's someone else. On what -- like,

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:32.679
this is well-written, this is badly written,
and why it is. But the more useful thing is

00:31:32.679 --> 00:31:36.990
to actually to write things and maybe get
some type of peer review. So, it probably

00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:40.539
won't fit directly into that knowledge map
structure, but I think there probably, there

00:31:40.539 --> 00:31:43.799
is something we could do to leverage the two
million students using Khan Academy right

00:31:43.799 --> 00:31:48.450
now, where you write an essay -- maybe we
have essay competitions, or people write essays

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:51.360
and then they peer-review it and the best
ones surface. I think there's something that

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:55.220
we could do, but we don't -- we haven't figured
that out yet. I'll take one right here.

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:59.251
&gt;&gt;audience #3: So I'm a huge fan. I actually
watched most of your linear algebra lectures

00:31:59.251 --> 00:32:03.390
over the winter break, and I've been trying
to tell everyone I know--

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:09.639
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: You deserve a badge.

00:32:09.639 --> 00:32:10.639
[laughter]

00:32:10.639 --> 00:32:20.940
&gt;&gt;audience #3: I thought about it; different
things to get badges and showing them to everyone.

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:25.040
So I've been telling everyone I know about
Khan Academy, but I was brainstorming with

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.040
other engineers here about how we can do -- what
can we do to help? As you mentioned, other

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:27.040
people giving lectures isn't necessarily helpful
because they might not be good lectures. So,

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:28.480
what can other individuals, or Google, do
to accelerate this process other than just

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.480
giving money?

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.490
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: Yeah. Oh you could give more
money.

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:32.490
[laughter}

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:33.490
&gt;&gt;audience #3: Well, I mean--

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:36.740
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: No, no, actually, genuinely,
geniuinely and you're right. I mean, we view

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:41.230
the ñ actually the videos are kind of what
get people into our fold, but then the real

00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:45.700
value is the exercises and the other. And
I think, eventually, the communities are gonna

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:51.570
be super valuable. So, I don't know the policies
of volunteering code for other projects and

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:57.539
things, but those modules, they're very stand-alone.
We're speccing them out and if you say, "Hey!

00:32:57.539 --> 00:33:02.840
I could write a cool or I could write a whole
set of modules on grammar." We'd love that.

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:08.610
Work with us; we're literally based on Castro
Street, so we're not too far away. But if

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:12.470
there's more sophisticated things, people
at Google, even outside of the funding, have

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:16.169
helped us move forward with some of the translations
and things like that. So, there's interesting

00:33:16.169 --> 00:33:20.759
things out there, AdGoogle, either products
that could directly benefit some of what I've

00:33:20.759 --> 00:33:24.960
talked about, or you're like, "Hey, I think
it'd be fun to crank out a couple of those

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:28.740
modules or have some neat ideas for them",
we'd love to have your help and we are hiring,

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:30.720
if any of yíall are looking for a sabbatical.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:31.720
[laughter]

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:36.820
I don't know what the policy is on things
like that. I'll --

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:38.130
&gt;&gt;audience #3: I had one more quick question,
'cause--

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:41.250
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: Oh yeah, yeah, sure.

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:42.509
&gt;&gt;audience #3: How much planning do you do
for your videos?

00:33:42.509 --> 00:33:43.509
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: How much what?

00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:44.509
&gt;&gt;audience #3: How much pre-planning do you
do?

00:33:44.509 --> 00:33:45.860
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: How much pre-planning do I
do before the videos? So, if I'm doing like

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:52.220
an algebra worked example, I literally will
like, put it up there and just do the problem.

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:55.450
Like the first -- when you see me do it, it's
usually the first time I'm looking at the

00:33:55.450 --> 00:34:03.500
problem, unless something disastrous happens.
If I'm doing, like I did some videos recently

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:08.860
on China. Actually, there's one of the ones
on the montage on how China pegs its currency

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:14.450
to the US dollar; that one is something I'm
kind of familiar with from my hedge fund life,

00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:20.991
so on my walk to work, I'll think about it
and then when I sit down I'll just do it.

00:34:20.991 --> 00:34:24.460
So, if I'm doing something that I'm really
not that familiar with, where I really have

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:29.460
to get myself re-immersed, like organic chemistry,
that I'll spend like two weeks literally just

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:34.990
immersing myself in the field, and getting
the ñ kind of living and breathing organic

00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:39.060
chemistry. And then I'll make the video. I
tell people that I try to prepare my brain,

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:43.180
but I don't try to script the lectures, because
then they come off unnatural, or scripted.

00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:52.830
[laughs] I'll alternate. How can we be sure
that great programs like this don't widen

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:57.140
the gap between the haves and have nots? Those
who need the most help are often unlikely

00:34:57.140 --> 00:35:02.260
to have a home computer or a high speed connection.
So, that's actually a really good point, and

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:06.160
I suspect, it's not something that I'd like
to admit, but I suspect that right now we

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:12.740
maybe are; that right now it is people, I
think Khan Academy's penetration is much higher

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:17.280
in Google households than it is in random
households across the country. And I think

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.470
itís definitely much higher than households
where there isn't a parent with a college

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:26.120
education. So I think right now we are, probably
in the short term, unfortunately doing that.

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:30.800
I think over the long term, though, what it
does is it--right now when everyone says,

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:34.140
"Oh, we should get one laptop per child or
we should put fiber to this school or that

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:37.700
school." There's not a tangible reason to
do it. Like people -- there's a feel-good

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:41.930
reason that maybe it'll help. It'll probably
help kids have the access, but I think once

00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:48.310
something like a Khan Academy exists and people
see that ñ we better get our act together

00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:52.460
-- this will actually be the catalyst for
getting fiber into the classroom, the catalyst

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:57.130
for getting laptops in front of kids. Then
it'll actually close the gap because the delivery

00:35:57.130 --> 00:36:04.180
cost is actually zero. One thing that we're
saying is -- Los Altos is not a needy neighborhood,

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:07.680
but they were quick to adopt it because they're
flexible and we were really impressed with

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:11.210
how they run. There's some private schools
that want to adopt it really fast and there's

00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:15.230
no bureaucracy or nothing, so they're adopting
it. But what we suspect is going to happen

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:21.370
is they're setting the best practice and then,
hopefully, around the rest of the country

00:36:21.370 --> 00:36:25.120
or around the world, all sorts of upper middle
class, middle class, lower middle class, will

00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:29.870
say, "Wait, if they're doing that at Los Altos,
or they're doing it at that fancy private

00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:33.750
school, how come our kids are not doing it?
And on top of everything, it's free. So, there's

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:38.320
no reason not to do it." So I think in the
near term, there might be a little bit of

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:42.080
that, but hopefully over the long term, it
actually serves as a catalyst to close, to

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:44.040
actually motivate the technology gap.

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:54.860
&gt;&gt;audience #4: Hi. My name is Anne, and I
should admit that both of my parents are math

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:59.860
teachers and I was a math teacher before I
came to Google. So, it's really exciting to

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:02.230
see, like, I've certainly seen a lot of times
with my family being skeptical of various

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:05.360
ways of technology trying to replace, but
it's really exciting because it's very much

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:08.570
correlated with the types of challenges. And
my mom is especially into self-paced learning,

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:11.440
which is really time intensive and people-intensive
so it's a really amazing way to let that happen

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:17.060
and let the teachers focus on the most important
place where they can add the most value. I

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:19.970
was wondering how you've seen teachers incorporate
this in terms of when they want to do deeper

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:22.950
problem solving, or group work, and how does
that, how does that classroom experience integrate

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:23.950
and --

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:27.260
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: Yeah, so the question is about
how does this integrate with what teachers

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:31.050
are trying to do with a deeper experience
and we haven't, I get a lot of anecdotal stuff

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:34.390
on emails and stuff and I said, even before
we started doing this pilot with Los Altos,

00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:38.501
there were teachers who are flipping the classroom,
lectures at home, or home and in the classroom,

00:37:38.501 --> 00:37:41.800
and then the teacher can work with them. And
what we're seeing in Los Altos is, and even

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:44.731
those teachers, is because you're freeing
up all of this time where this lecture doesn't

00:37:44.731 --> 00:37:50.250
have to happen in the classroom, it depends
on the teacher, but it frees up a ton of time

00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:55.020
so they can do the project-based learning.
There's so much debate: project-based learning

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:59.901
versus the traditional doing a lot of exercises
and seeing a lot of problems is learning.

00:37:59.901 --> 00:38:03.960
And what's cool about this is you can do both.
They're both valuable. It's actually not an

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:07.300
either/or proposition. And even a lot of people
said, "Do you teach new math or old math?"

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:12.130
I do both. You know, why not? There's no reason
ñ there's no limitation for our classroom,

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:15.410
so you can actually do every possible way
of looking at something.

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:17.340
&gt;&gt;audience #4: Awesome. Thanks again. It's
really amazing.

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:21.150
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: Yeah. Oh, thanks, thanks. I'll
take one here. Students are now truly--I'm

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:25.030
doing it like the videos, I don't know how
bad these questions are gonna be ñ they might

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:26.100
put me on the spot--

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:27.100
[laughter]

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:29.380
"Students are now truly empowered to work
through course material at their own pace.

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:33.750
How do you create meaningful cohort groupings
in this context? Age--as opposed to skill--seems

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:37.430
to be inefficient from the perspective of
maximizing learning." So, I completely agree

00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:42.070
with that. So this, even in the Los Altos
classroom, you have--it's a fifth grade classroom;

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:46.660
they're all ten or eleven years old--and there
you have that mix. Our idea would actually

00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:51.030
be a classroom of all age groups. Literally,
in the same room, you have fifth graders,

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:56.250
or you have five year-olds and you have 18
year-olds, and there's no kind of preconceived

00:38:56.250 --> 00:39:00.420
notion that if you're 13 and you're learning
this, you're stupid. It's just the pace that

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:04.150
everyone learns at. And what you get there,
I actually think everyone in the mix will

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:09.680
actually act a lot more mature when they're
around older and younger students. And then

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:18.530
you get the true benefit of the learning across
generations. So, I completely ñ I completely

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:21.250
agree with that; that it's a good comment,
I guess.

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:22.250
[audience member claps]

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:24.210
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll take--

00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:25.210
&gt;&gt;audience #5: [ ]

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:27.710
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: Oh, very good. Thank you. Go
ahead.

00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:32.440
&gt;&gt;audience #6: Great. After all these very
wonderful questions, I have a really pragmatic

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:33.440
one.

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:34.440
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: Yeah, yeah.

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:37.200
&gt;&gt;audience #6: Which is, your lectures, for
example, on the French Revolution and the

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:42.430
California High School Exit Exam, use imagery
and problems from other sources. How do you

00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:43.430
dance around copyright?

00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:47.920
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: How do I dance around copyright?
So I have a very loose interpretation of "fair

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:48.920
use".

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:49.920
[laughter]

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:58.201
No, no, no. Well, that's actually true. But
the -- so, all of this, like the French Revolution

00:39:58.201 --> 00:40:01.880
stuff, I do look on Wikipedia, I look for
stuff that's in the public domain. Most of

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:05.930
those paintings and stuff are in the public
domain. The copyrights expired. Stuff like

00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:10.530
the California or the Massachusettsís Test
for Teacher Licensing, I mean, these tests

00:40:10.530 --> 00:40:18.190
are written by government bodies and I assume
they want teachers to pass. And so, I've taken--on

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:21.710
things like that, if it's a government sponsored--
I also have stuff for like the IIT Joint Entrance

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:26.040
Exam, I have some of their problems. These
are issued by the Indian government. I didn't

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:30.961
ask their permission. But I assume, I mean,
they can sue me. It would be an interesting

00:40:30.961 --> 00:40:31.981
PR issue for them.

00:40:31.981 --> 00:40:33.480
[laughter]

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:40.870
But I ñ I ñ I ñ one -- I actually do think
it falls under fair use, but even -- I would

00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:46.640
be very surprised if they were upset. I wouldn't
take something from McGraw Hill and do it,

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:48.650
is a simple answer, or I'd ask their permission
first.

00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:49.650
&gt;&gt;audience #6: Thanks.

00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:52.320
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: And I am careful about the
Wikipedia creative commons and all that other

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:57.470
stuff, too. Yeah. Simple. So, next one." What
tools and techniques are you using to interest

00:40:57.470 --> 00:41:01.190
students who are traditionally not self-motivated
or those requiring a different learning style

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:06.062
than a standard video provides?" So, traditionally
not self-motivated. Actually, the gaming is

00:41:06.062 --> 00:41:11.261
a huge thing for the traditionally not self-motivated.
And actually, I think once -- a lot of people

00:41:11.261 --> 00:41:14.361
are just not motivated because they have these
gaps in their knowledge that the traditional

00:41:14.361 --> 00:41:18.110
model can't address and people are just talking
past each other. And if you allow them to

00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:21.481
remediate, without feeling embarrassed, and
they can do it in a game framework and they

00:41:21.481 --> 00:41:27.680
get points and badges, that, actually, I think
solves a lot, a lot of the actual motivation

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:34.950
problem. The other ñ the other -- the learning
styles, what are you doing requiring different

00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:38.700
learning style that a standard video provides?
So there's a couple of things. I mean, there's

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:42.470
the video, but I think the exercises are at
least as important and that's what we do more

00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:45.730
for the peers to be able to interact with
each other. That's as least as important.

00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:50.460
But the other thing is--this isn't Khan Academy
related--but they've actually done a lot of

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:54.950
studies, like double-blind control studies
and the learning styles is kind of a myth;

00:41:54.950 --> 00:42:00.420
that there's actually a good instruction and
bad instruction. Everyone likes to think that

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:05.320
"I'm an auditory learner, I'm a visual learner,"
but the reality is ñ no -- there's some things

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:08.310
you learn, you're learning art history or
geometry, you're a visual. If you're learning

00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:11.220
a foreign language, you're auditory, or maybe
a little bit of visual. If you're learning

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:15.190
certain things, you like to see it written.
And when they actually did double-blind, this

00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:21.010
is easy -- you can go Google it. There's a
bunch of styles; I was just reading this last

00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:26.110
week, that there's actually no evidence that
to teach people who are self-identified, or

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:31.550
somehow identified auditory learners in an
auditory way, actually is better than not.

00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:35.860
But with that said is ñ with that said, I
think there are multiple ways to teach the

00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:42.070
same thing and so, I'll make videos. I think
in the future, we'll probably have other hopefully

00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:47.280
good lecturers who will take a slightly different
take on things. Even some topics, I take five

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:51.320
different takes on it, so people see it from
a bunch of different angles. Maybe at different

00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:55.240
skill levels. Even now, there are some videos
that are very primary, a little bit more mechanical,

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:59.000
but some go a lot deeper and go into the proofs
and go into the actual intuition. So I think

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.340
itís just making sure that there's enough
material out there that it responds to every

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:05.160
type of learner. I'lló[pause]

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:12.390
&gt;&gt;audience #7: The way, the implementation,
that you've done is great, but the ideas aren't

00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:13.390
really new.

00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:14.390
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: Nope.

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:16.260
&gt;&gt;audience #7: They're 30, 40, 50, 200 years
old.

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:17.260
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: Yep.

00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:24.200
&gt;&gt;audience #7: So, I was wondering how much,
how much you've been able to tap into the

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:30.960
small bit of this kind of learning that's
been done in the past, talking about like

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:31.960
Sudbury Schools--

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:32.960
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: Yeah.

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:40.190
&gt;&gt;audience #7: or some of the very radical
educational groups, un-schoolers? How much

00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:44.730
has been able to flow back into the things
you're doing in Khan Academy?

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:50.381
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: Yeah. So the general concepts
here are not at all new and actually, I was

00:43:50.381 --> 00:43:54.510
recently looking, I mean people -- this whole
notion of actually mastering something before

00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:58.880
you move to another concept, it's called mastery-based
learning and people have been talking about

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:05.160
it for 80 years and have actually done studies
on it, like 30 years ago. The two definitive,

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:07.980
in all of the education research, the two
definitive studies, or at least the only two

00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:12.320
that I've found that are just super definitive,
are one, mastery-based learning. Every trial

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:16.040
they did, and they did this 30 years ago with
like worksheets and people walking around,

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:19.920
but it was essentially the same model had
unambiguous success. I mean, these kids were

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:24.200
learning at several fold the pace of traditional
students, with much better retention and much

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:29.360
better mastery of things. And then the other
thing, there's actually a good bit of research,

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:34.850
30 years old, definitive, never refuted, is
that when people watch a lecture, they zone

00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:39.460
out after 15 minutes. And they zone out for
about five minutes and then when they zone

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:43.060
back in, they're only able to zone in for
about nine minutes. And then they zone out

00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:46.110
for another five minutes and then when they
zone back in, they can only zone in for about

00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:50.040
six minutes. And this process goes until,
by the end of a 90 minute lecture, they can

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:52.890
only zone in for like three or four minutes.
And I think we've all experienced that. Hopefully,

00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:54.180
none of yíall are right now.

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:55.290
[laughter]

00:44:55.290 --> 00:45:04.311
But these are not ñ but to the question's
point, these are not new ideas. Even when

00:45:04.311 --> 00:45:07.580
radio came out, people said, "This is gonna
revolutionize education; get the best lecturers,

00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:14.680
put them on radio." TV came out; same idea.
VCRs came out; same idea. I think what makes

00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:19.490
it different this time is it is so easy to
get at. I mean, it is literally on demand,

00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:23.060
and you have all of the data, all of the analytics.
And I think there is something about the actual

00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:29.100
craftsmanship. This wasn't built by a bureaucracy
at the Department of Education, or a bureaucracy

00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:33.300
at a publishing company. This was built by
people who are literally looking at the learner

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:38.020
and saying, "Well, what does the learner want?
And what's useful for them?" In terms of actually

00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:40.480
leveraging some of that stuff, I think we
can leverage the spirit, I think we can leverage

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:46.350
a lot of the models. And it gives us confidence
that look, there's actually a huge amount

00:45:46.350 --> 00:45:51.130
of research, it's just nothing exists because
it wasn't practical until now. And I think

00:45:51.130 --> 00:45:57.100
that's probably the level that we can leverage
a lot of these other models. I'll take one

00:45:57.100 --> 00:46:01.320
over here. "Your program demonstrates the
role that technology can play to make learning

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:04.470
efficient and effective, yet the adoption
rate for technology in the public education

00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:09.640
system is lagging. What hurdles must we overcome
to get these tools in the classroom?" So I

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:12.760
think the technology in the public education
system is lagging for good reason. I don't

00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:18.580
know -- even when I was in school, in the
80s, we had computers in the classroom and

00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:25.210
we would go into the computer lab and we would
learn how to insert a diskette. Or, really

00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:31.410
silly stuff, like how to boot the computer.
There was no actually using the technology

00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:35.051
in the classroom. And I think that goes all
the way now where people have iPad's but they're

00:46:35.051 --> 00:46:39.490
still not really doing something constructive.
So, I think a lot of the skepticism was actually

00:46:39.490 --> 00:46:45.920
warranted. And hopefully, Khan Academy will
be a catalyst for saying, "OK, finally we

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:50.570
have something that is actually something
to do with the technology in the classroom."

00:46:50.570 --> 00:46:56.000
And so, I'm hoping it's actually going to
be a catalyst for solving that problem. Go.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.251
&gt;&gt;audience #8: I mean this is a very disruptive
approach, things like flipping the classroom

00:47:00.251 --> 00:47:04.460
and so on. Are there any stakeholders where
you've encountered strong resistance? I don't

00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:07.250
know, parents, principals, teachers, or somebody?

00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:16.160
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: Yeah, so have you encountered
any resistance? It's strange, but no. One,

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:22.100
because from the get-go, you know the way
-- it's been a very organic process. So, never,

00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:26.310
five years ago, even now, we're not saying,
"We are going to lobby the Department of Education,

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:30.630
or this state body, or this school district,
and we're going to try to sell our product

00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:33.640
to them." If we did that, we would face a
lot of resistance. What we're doing is we're

00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:37.740
literally putting stuff out there. We have
mainly the student in mind and forward-thinking

00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:43.040
schools and institutions and school districts
are coming to us and so, they've been, they've

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:48.031
been pretty amazing about doing it. I think
one interesting thing that'll happen, I think

00:47:48.031 --> 00:47:50.610
for almost everyone in this room, if you were
to be a school teacher, this would be a more

00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:54.870
fun way to teach. You get to go into a room,
you don't have to prepare.

00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:55.870
[laughter]

00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:58.430
And, and you have -- you get to be a mentor
for these students. I think what could be

00:47:58.430 --> 00:48:03.030
a little scary for some teachers is that you're
a fifth grade teacher, but there's some kids

00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:08.910
doing calculus in that room. And what we've
seen with the Los Altos students, it's actually

00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:12.670
pretty profound what they've been doing. They
walk up to those kids, cause some of those

00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:14.630
kids go red on like, the chain rule, right?

00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:15.630
[laughter]

00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:18.950
And so, the teacher's like, "I have to intervene."

00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:19.950
[laughter]

00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:25.030
She'll walk up to that student, she's like,
"You know what? I haven't seen this since

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:28.980
college and I forgot how to do it. Let's learn
about this together." And it takes a lot of

00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:32.860
self-confidence for a teacher to admit that
they aren't the know-it-all at the front of

00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:38.070
the classroom, but they are just maybe a more
mature, someone who's seen more of the world,

00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:41.710
but they're at the same level mathematically
right now but they can learn it together.

00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:46.170
So I think that's the paradigm shift that
will have to go on, but I think it becomes

00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:50.550
much more pleasant as a teacher to be able
to do that. And the kid immediately responds

00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:55.430
to the teacher. The kid immediately respects
the teacher more when he or she actually communicates

00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:56.560
in that kind of way.

00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:58.570
&gt;&gt;audience #7: And parents seem to be OK with
it, also?

00:48:58.570 --> 00:49:04.620
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: Yeah, with the Los Altos, we
had no experience actually working in a school

00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:10.310
system. The Los Altos principals and school
board, they set up some parent meetings, and

00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:12.660
the parents ñ they were all -- so that they
felt comfortable with it. They gave everyone

00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:17.540
the option to opt out; no one opted out. And
now, they're getting a lot of push to go,

00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:22.800
as you can imagine. We're gonna continue to
multiple classrooms. You can imagine there

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:28.100
are fifth graders where some of the kids aren't
doing the chain rule and their parents are

00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:29.691
getting a little paranoid.

00:49:29.691 --> 00:49:30.691
[laughter]

00:49:30.691 --> 00:49:36.220
That little gap is occurring. I'll ask a--."
The modern economy demands an increasingly

00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:40.680
educated workforce, yet higher education continues
to become more and more unaffordable. How

00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:46.620
is this situation rectified? Can 'college'
be disrupted?" So, the simple answer is yes.

00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:48.610
[laughter]

00:49:48.610 --> 00:49:51.820
And actually, I think this is something, I
mean, I don't know if I should go on the record,

00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:56.751
on video, but I said this at lunch, so no
harm saying it now. Actually, I think Google

00:49:56.751 --> 00:50:02.280
could play a big role in that. Imagine--and
the details have yet to be worked out--but

00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:06.310
imagine where all of the core academic stuff
Khan Academy takes care of. If you wanna learn

00:50:06.310 --> 00:50:11.090
electric circuits, if you wanna learn big-O
notation, if you wanna learn capital asset

00:50:11.090 --> 00:50:15.920
pricing models, Khan Academy can do those
academic things. So, imagine if there was

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:22.790
a university in Mountain Viewówe'll put it
in downtown Castro Street; it has a nice vibe

00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:26.720
and all of that-- and you literally, I mean,
we could even leverage Khan Academy. We know

00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:29.951
all of the best students are gonna be using
Khan Academy already. I think a lot of them

00:50:29.951 --> 00:50:39.060
are and so, we don't have a, if you started
an institution, you don't have this kind of

00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:43.460
recognition problem. But what you do is the
students, you say, "Look, instead of going

00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:47.570
to MIT or Stanford or Harvard, why don't you
come to this new university--whatever you

00:50:47.570 --> 00:50:53.840
call it; Silicon Valley, whatever; some name--
and the focus is you spend one year at Google,

00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:58.190
or six months at Google, six months at Apple,
six months working on a project for Kleiner

00:50:58.190 --> 00:51:03.580
Perkins, six month writing an iPhone app,
six months working at Facebook. And you do

00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:08.050
a series of projects; those projects are essentially
your transcript. We have seminars. We'll even

00:51:08.050 --> 00:51:11.750
set up a little bit of a dorm for you so you
have the nice college experience and you can

00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:15.590
walk into each otherís classrooms, each other's
bedrooms in the middle of the night and chat

00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:18.870
about things and all the rest. And instead
of you paying any tuition, we're gonna pay

00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:24.490
you. Each of those companies, instead of,
I mean, all of a sudden, when I graduated

00:51:24.490 --> 00:51:30.470
from college, all of a sudden all of these--Google
didn't exist then--but Google-like companies

00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:34.410
were like, "Oh, here's a smart guy and from
a good school. I wanna hire him." And literally

00:51:34.410 --> 00:51:39.180
four years ago, I had probably 90 percent
of the same skills and I couldn't get a job

00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:42.180
at a local supermarket. I'm serious. Like,
I literally applied to a supermarket and I

00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:45.700
couldn't get a job. And it was just the process
of going to one of these schools that was

00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:52.840
just like a big signal. So, on one side, actually
you would get these really smart 17 or 18-year

00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:57.470
olds immediately doing useful things and we
know from recent companies that started, that

00:51:57.470 --> 00:52:02.390
there's some very innovative things that 18
or 19 year olds can do, and the company's

00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:05.500
benefit. But even more important, these people
are actually getting tangible skills, but

00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:08.900
they're still getting the academic component
because a lot of that can be done self-paced,

00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:16.090
it can be done in a seminar format, and frankly,
the faculty then, it becomes all of you guys.

00:52:16.090 --> 00:52:20.120
And the management at Google and Apple and
the VCs in the areas and the entrepreneurs

00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:24.010
in the areas, and I think if you have an institution
like that, and all of a sudden, people not

00:52:24.010 --> 00:52:28.020
only do they not have to pay for school, they
can actually get paid to go to school and

00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:31.910
they finish and they're probably gonna get
a better salary and better job placement than

00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:37.970
pretty much any other university in the world.
I think just that example would pretty much

00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:42.470
disrupt education; disrupt higher education.
So, we'll have to work out the details.

00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:43.470
[laughter]

00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:49.120
&gt;&gt;audience #8: Hi. So, the mastiff actually
looks really great and I'm just really excited

00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:53.560
to see this kind of thing. My question was
how it extends to sciences, where sometimes

00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:55.380
there really isn't a correct answer--

00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:56.380
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: Yeah.

00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:59.900
&gt;&gt;audience #8: or, at least if you just write
a bunch of word problems, physics word problems

00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:04.410
aren't really physics. There's something more
deep going on there and I was wondering how

00:53:04.410 --> 00:53:06.490
you would, if you had any thoughts on how
that extends.

00:53:06.490 --> 00:53:09.880
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: Yes. How do we extend that
stuff? Maybe itís not as concrete, multiple-choice,

00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:13.300
or free answer, right answer all the time.
Well, what I think there is a lot that is

00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:16.240
that, is that kind of builds a scaffold, so
you would do the traditional kinematics and

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:23.030
Newtonian mechanics and the traditional problem
sets, you can do in this type of a form factor.

00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:28.760
And then it can be all self-paced. I think
to get to the next level of real, deep understanding,

00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:32.190
there's a couple things that we could do.
We could more simulation-based learning, where

00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:35.510
as you go through that knowledge map, at some
points these simulations unlock, or maybe

00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:39.880
they always unlock and you have to figure
out some things just by observing the simulations.

00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:44.510
I think a really interesting thing -- one
thing that people -- we talk about providing

00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:48.020
education, but one thing we don't do is we
don't credential people right now; we don't,

00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:56.590
in an authenticable kind of way. So, maybe
oral exams is the right answer. Like, you

00:53:56.590 --> 00:54:01.060
have badges and right now, you're a novice
physicist, or whatever, first level physics

00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:06.930
person, on the Khan Academy. If you want to
get to the middle level or the ninja level

00:54:06.930 --> 00:54:12.580
or whatever we end up calling it, you have
to get five other ninja level people to have

00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:16.990
a Skype oral exam with you. And only then,
if four of the five, or five out of five,

00:54:16.990 --> 00:54:21.590
say "He's ready to be a physics ninja," that's
too cheesy of a name, but then he will move

00:54:21.590 --> 00:54:25.640
up. There's actually a possibility here to
actually do the best of, I mean, the gold

00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:31.190
standard in evaluation is the oral exam. But
it has to be well done. But I think there

00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:34.400
is something here where we could go to that
level.

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.210
&gt;&gt;audience #8: Thank you.

00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:40.580
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: I'll take, "Currently, most
of the content is focused on learner-centric

00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:44.320
approach. Are there plans to incorporate content
for instructors/facilitators- more softer

00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:51.800
skills? Example: Presentation skills, facilitation
skills, adult learning theories, etc." We

00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:57.850
will. I mean, we will do, I don't know if
it'll just be for instructors/facilitators,

00:54:57.850 --> 00:55:04.520
but, I don't know -- this might ruin the Khan
Academy, but I've been tempted to give dating

00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:05.520
advice on the --

00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:06.890
[laughter]

00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:11.370
My son's two years old right now and the theory
is, when he's 17, he's more likely to listen

00:55:11.370 --> 00:55:17.130
to 34 year old Sal than 50 year old Sal. And
so, if I just record them now, it'll be like

00:55:17.130 --> 00:55:18.130
a nice time shift of--

00:55:18.130 --> 00:55:19.130
[laughter]

00:55:19.130 --> 00:55:20.130
I'm kind of serious about -- but--

00:55:20.130 --> 00:55:21.130
[laughter]

00:55:21.130 --> 00:55:26.230
we're open to it. I mean, we don't wanna do
something that's really cheesy, like "Make

00:55:26.230 --> 00:55:29.960
sure to eat five different groups of fruits
and vegetables." I mean, some people have

00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:33.360
lobbied for videos like that. We want people
where any Khan Academy video you watch, there's

00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:39.500
kind of line an "aha" moment, like "Yes. I
understand something about the world that

00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:44.640
I'm not getting from other sources." We would
want to do it so it's actually meaningful,

00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:49.670
but we're not opposed to doing softer skills
type of things. We'll see how it works. We

00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:50.670
don't know.

00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:54.970
&gt;&gt;audience #9: So, it's clear to me how this
stuff can work really well at the elementary

00:55:54.970 --> 00:56:00.920
level, but I'm more worried about what it
might do to the curriculum at the higher levels.

00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:06.870
I have helped my kids learn this stuff all
the way up and by the time you get to Euclidian

00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:12.750
geometry, a good problem might take half an
hour to an hour to solve. The answer might

00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:17.170
be half a page proof and there might be ten
different proofs that are equally valid. I've

00:56:17.170 --> 00:56:21.420
actually had some specific problems that I've
worked through with my son. So how do you

00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:26.300
cope with the fact that you're limited to
this form factor that you described to us?

00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:29.760
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: Yeah. I think some of that
can be tackled--this form factor--not all

00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:34.430
of it. I mean, if we designed the modules
right you could actually probably do fairly

00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:38.710
deep, I mean -- it would be hard to be able
to have someone actually write the proof and

00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:42.030
then do a proof check. I mean, even people
have attempted--

00:56:42.030 --> 00:56:43.550
&gt;&gt;audience #10: [ ]

00:56:43.550 --> 00:56:48.491
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: OK, so it's done. Computers
can do it.

00:56:48.491 --> 00:56:50.630
&gt;&gt;audience #9: Not as a practical matter.

00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:55.070
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: I mean seriously -- I think
we're gonna try to do, we're gonna try to

00:56:55.070 --> 00:57:00.130
tackle as much as you can do with that form
factor, but what we're hoping is if you get

00:57:00.130 --> 00:57:05.330
a lot of the blocking/tackling done this way,
it frees up a lot of time so that when there

00:57:05.330 --> 00:57:09.643
actually is human interaction, and a human
interaction might be with a parent, it might

00:57:09.643 --> 00:57:14.080
be with a teacher. We have these Meetups happening
and these Meetups might turn into spontaneous

00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:19.080
tutoring sessions, where people can work through
hard, more difficult problems, or group problems.

00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:23.190
I think some of that stuff could, I mean,
we're even entertaining, I mean, now we have

00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:26.910
enough students where we're even entertaining
Khan Academy math competitions. It's the next

00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:31.850
level where it's like human written, unique
problems and that maybe teams in different

00:57:31.850 --> 00:57:34.840
areas can try to solve it. Maybe they can
even collaborate. We haven't thought about

00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:38.290
it deeply yet, but I think it's doable. It
won't just be a hundred percent automated,

00:57:38.290 --> 00:57:39.290
though.

00:57:39.290 --> 00:57:43.090
&gt;&gt;audience #9: Right. And in a much shorter
question that perhaps has the same answer,

00:57:43.090 --> 00:57:47.780
I coached Math Olympiad for a number of years
and one of the things I really enjoyed was

00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:52.980
when the students came up with a solution
that was not the one that I was gonna suggest.

00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:56.121
You kind of cut the feedback loop here. Is
that a problem?

00:57:56.121 --> 00:57:59.980
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: Yeah, I think on Math Olympiad
type questions, I think that's going to be

00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:05.690
a completely different-- it won't be this.
It will be, so we are playing with the notion

00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:11.480
of having a question repository, human-written
questions. Although, right now, we're thinking

00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:16.190
it would still be more the right answer type
of things, not proof-based. But you could

00:58:16.190 --> 00:58:21.050
imagine, actually, that would get closer to
the peer-to-peer writing type of thing. So,

00:58:21.050 --> 00:58:24.880
there's a question, people submit solutions
and then if you have a critical mass of people

00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:29.530
on the system, they can evaluate it--kind
of a peer review-- and they can say, "Whose

00:58:29.530 --> 00:58:33.510
proof was the coolest?" or something like
that. I don't know. So, it won't be automated

00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:37.240
in the instruction but because of the Web
and the number of people you have, kind of

00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:40.240
a critical mass, you could probably get a
good peer-to-peer thing going, I think.

00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:42.290
&gt;&gt;audience #9: All right. So, one last try
at the first question.

00:58:42.290 --> 00:58:43.290
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:58:43.290 --> 00:58:46.300
&gt;&gt;audience #9: Because you didn't really answer
what scares me most. I'm worried that this

00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:50.830
will be so successful that it's gonna dumb
down the curricula. It's going to be easy

00:58:50.830 --> 00:58:55.760
enough, maybe it's gonna be so much easier
for the school to do stuff in this way, that

00:58:55.760 --> 00:59:01.160
things that aren't amenable to automation
will simply vanish from the curriculum. Is

00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:02.160
that a legitimate worry?

00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:06.390
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: I don't think so. I hope the
first part about your worry is true; that

00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:07.390
it's wildly successful.

00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:10.430
[laughter]

00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:15.270
But I think the answer is that right now what
you have in schools, you have great teachers

00:59:15.270 --> 00:59:19.930
and you have not so great teachers and you
have things in-between. What happens is, the

00:59:19.930 --> 00:59:23.480
kids who have the not so great teachers, they're
still gonna be able to do well on the SAT.

00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:28.150
They're still gonna be able to do well on
the AP Calculus. They're not gonna be math

00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:31.550
Olympiads, but they're gonna get the blocking
and tackling, so that they still have the

00:59:31.550 --> 00:59:36.080
same opportunities and all that. And the students
who have the good teachers, the great teachers,

00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:39.640
those teachers are gonna see this as "Yeah,
this is taking all the blocking and tackling."

00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:44.560
Like, if you're tutoring kids, you can say,
"Look, you need to learn how to add fractions.

00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:47.000
I know you can do that on your own, especially
if you're gonna get to the Math Olympiad.

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:51.270
You can do that part on your own. Khan Academy
has your back, but then with the time with

00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:58.840
me, we're gonna go to the next level." I think,
across the board, hopefully it'll have an

00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:03.510
upward effect on the level of discourse. I
mean, it's like a lot of people are gonna

01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:07.910
have their gaps out of the way, so just everything,
hopefully, will be more intelligent in the

01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:11.630
classroom. Hopefully I'll take -- and anyone
should feel free to leave, I'll hang out here

01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:15.270
and answer a few more questions over the next,
I think we're out of time, but, I'll do another

01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:20.950
ten minutes of this and then we can just whatever.
OK? "Do you have any ideas about how to engage

01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:25.110
parents in their child's development?" The
easiest way to do that, any parents, is actually

01:00:25.110 --> 01:00:28.700
you should log on to Khan Academy right now,
and you should start doing the math problems.

01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:33.090
Although, I suspect, many of you already know
a lot of this material. But we've seen over

01:00:33.090 --> 01:00:36.880
and over again, that that fundamentally changes
the conversation that happens at the dinner

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:41.830
table; when parents are also doing the same
mathematics as their kids. I'll take one.

01:00:41.830 --> 01:00:45.990
&gt;&gt;audience #11: Is there a chance that kids
are just kind of like figuring out the trick

01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:51.530
and sort of getting through the thing, but
there's no real retention? Like ñ do you

01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:52.530
do anything?

01:00:52.530 --> 01:00:56.300
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: No, no. Not only is there a
chance, they are doing that. The kids are,

01:00:56.300 --> 01:01:01.130
the fifth graders especially, it's amazing
how good they are in gaming things, at figuring

01:01:01.130 --> 01:01:06.870
out "Oh, that can't be the choice, that can
be the choice." And so, it's a mixed blessing.

01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:11.000
One is, we are watching them and we're saying,
"Oh, they're just gaming that module." So,

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:16.040
we either have to make that module less gameable,
make it free answer, or do something to it

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:19.021
so that it can't be gamed. Or, we have to
add other modules to make sure that they're

01:01:19.021 --> 01:01:26.490
really learning the concept. In terms of retention,
we actually do have a thing that after X days,

01:01:26.490 --> 01:01:30.460
if you haven't done a module or another module
that covers that module, intrinsically covers

01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:34.710
that same concept, it asks you to review it,
so you get extra points to go back and review.

01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:38.930
So, the model is, the ideal school would be,
you're walking down the hallway in seventh

01:01:38.930 --> 01:01:41.840
grade and all of a sudden, your fifth grade
math teacher comes up to you and asks you

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:46.190
a fifth grade math question. And so, that's
what we're trying to do. It is gaming, but

01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:49.930
it is actually interesting because we actually
saw that with the chain rule module. A couple

01:01:49.930 --> 01:01:55.850
of fifth graders just figured out mechanically
how to, even that's not easy though, but they

01:01:55.850 --> 01:02:01.660
figured out just the pattern. But it was still
cool. Well, one, I'd argue a lot of twelfth

01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:07.620
graders are also doing that, but it was cool
once they figured out the pattern. They started

01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:11.110
to teach each other. So we actually even have
this one view, you can see the cascade. Who's

01:02:11.110 --> 01:02:13.770
the first student in the class and you can
see the cascade of the other students right

01:02:13.770 --> 01:02:19.140
after that, after one person gets it. But,
with that said, is we did identify that as

01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:24.010
-- we have to add more modules to make sure
people really are understanding the concept

01:02:24.010 --> 01:02:27.420
as opposed to just learning the mechanics.

01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:36.950
&gt;&gt;presenter: So, if you just take one more
question and after that, we have to basically

01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:42.500
wrap up for the video also. But, as he said,
he'll be hanging around and you guys can come

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:43.590
over and basically chat [ ].

01:02:43.590 --> 01:02:45.300
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: OK. I'll take it right here.

01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:49.130
&gt;&gt;audience #12: So, as you said, the Khan
Academy is definitely turning things around,

01:02:49.130 --> 01:02:53.950
and how, in the classroom with this kind of
self-instructed learning, how do you try to

01:02:53.950 --> 01:02:58.930
reapply the framework of a grading system
or a testing system to give the same kind

01:02:58.930 --> 01:03:02.140
of progress feedback that people are expecting
from education?

01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:07.730
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: Yeah, so the question, how
do you do the same type of assessment, or

01:03:07.730 --> 01:03:12.980
how can we start labeling kids if we're--.
I think it's a good problem to have. Maybe

01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:22.120
we shouldn't and I think the ideal is you
take -- I actually do think it is good that

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:26.830
we do have these standardized tests, the SAT
and the AP test, but the ideal is you don't

01:03:26.830 --> 01:03:30.980
take them when you're 17, like everyone lockstep
takes them when you're 17; you take them when

01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:34.520
you're ready for it. So, there's some fifth
graders and they're doing the Khan Academy.

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:37.521
When we have the 300 modules and we're like,
"Look, statistically, it looks like if you

01:03:37.521 --> 01:03:41.140
go and take the AP Calculus test right now",
we can even give them a distribution. "We

01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:45.710
think there's an 80 percent chance you're
gonna get a five, a four or a five or something.

01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:50.280
Go take it." And if there's a 17 year old
who we think ñ "there's an 80 percent chance

01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:54.230
that you're not gonna get higher than a three,
don't take it yet. Just keep working. Wait

01:03:54.230 --> 01:04:00.310
until you're 20, wait until you're 25, whatever.
If your goal is to learn calculus". One thing

01:04:00.310 --> 01:04:05.010
I'm hoping we can do, in a non-touchy feely
way, cause a lot of people, when people say

01:04:05.010 --> 01:04:09.250
"no grades," it sounds very touchy feely.
It's the opposite. We actually want people

01:04:09.250 --> 01:04:13.530
to master; everyone should be an A+ student.
Everyone should have a hundred percent mastery

01:04:13.530 --> 01:04:18.150
if they really wanna get to some future level.
I mean, I can't tell how many, even when I've

01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:22.480
interviewed, even in my past life, people
who've gone through algebra, trigonometry,

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:28.454
geometry, calculus, blah, blah, blah, and
they still don't know when to apply algebra.

01:04:28.454 --> 01:04:32.940
What was the whole point of this non-mastery
based learning? It was just a big jumping

01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:37.780
through hoops and showing that you know how
to do homework type of exercise. So, yeah.

01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:42.910
I think it'll be a good problem that if there's
no grades, and if there's literally just,

01:04:42.910 --> 01:04:47.310
"We say you know this." And if you don't know
this at A or B level, if we say you know it,

01:04:47.310 --> 01:04:49.250
you know it at an A level. Cool.

01:04:49.250 --> 01:04:50.651
&gt;&gt;audience #11: Thank you.

01:04:50.651 --> 01:04:51.651
&gt;&gt;Salman Khan: Thank you.

01:04:51.651 --> 01:04:51.690
[applause]
