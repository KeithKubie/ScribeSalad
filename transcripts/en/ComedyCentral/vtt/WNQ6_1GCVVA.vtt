00:00:00.968 --> 00:00:02.302
- GOOD EVENING.

00:00:02.336 --> 00:00:03.871
WE'RE COMING TO YOU
FROM THE HISTORIC ELYSIAN PARK

00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:05.772
IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA.

00:00:05.806 --> 00:00:07.608
NOW, EVERY WEEK ON MY SHOW,
I CHALLENGE PEOPLE

00:00:07.641 --> 00:00:09.209
TO TAKE BIG RISKS.

00:00:09.243 --> 00:00:12.346
BUT SOME HAVE BEEN CRITICAL
THAT I NEVER TAKE RISKS MYSELF.

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:14.781
WELL, TONIGHT,
THAT'S ALL GONNA CHANGE.

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:16.383
OVER THE PAST MONTH,
I'VE BEEN LEARNING

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:19.386
HOW TO PICK THE LOCK
ON THESE POLICE-GRADE HANDCUFFS.

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:20.854
"WHY?" YOU ASK.

00:00:20.888 --> 00:00:22.789
BECAUSE TONIGHT I'M GONNA TAKE
A BIGGER RISK

00:00:22.823 --> 00:00:25.893
THAN ANYONE HAS EVER TAKEN
ON TELEVISION BEFORE.

00:00:25.926 --> 00:00:27.995
IN JUST A FEW MOMENTS,
I'M GOING TO BE HANDCUFFED

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:29.897
TO THIS SOLID STEEL FRAME,

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.766
AND I'LL HAVE EXACTLY 90 SECONDS
TO FREE MYSELF

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:35.502
BEFORE THE CLAW
ON THIS ROBOTIC ARM

00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:37.304
UNDOES MY PANTS,

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:40.974
EXPOSING ME TO AN AUDIENCE
OF CHILDREN.

00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:43.477
IF THAT HAPPENS,
AN L.A.P.D. OFFICER

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.014
IS STANDING BY TO ARREST ME
FOR INDECENT EXPOSURE.

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:50.617
WE'VE ALL SEEN ESCAPE ARTISTS
RISK DEATH BEFORE.

00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:54.655
BUT TONIGHT, I'M GOING TO RISK
SOMETHING EVEN WORSE:

00:00:54.688 --> 00:00:57.691
BECOMING A REGISTERED
SEX OFFENDER FOR LIFE.

00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:01.128
AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING
TO SEE TONIGHT IS 100% REAL.

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:03.063
WELCOME TO <i>NATHAN FOR YOU.</i>

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:06.066
THIS IS THE CLAW OF SHAME.

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.101
[dramatic music]

00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:09.670
- NOW, YOU KNOW
THIS IS CONTROVERSIAL, RIGHT?

00:01:09.703 --> 00:01:12.272
- WHAT DO I GAIN BY DOING THIS?
- NOTHING.

00:01:12.306 --> 00:01:15.075
- IF HE'S GONNA ESCAPE,
IF HE'S GONNA GO TO JAIL.

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:17.644
- I MIGHT NOT EVEN ATTEMPT IT.

00:01:17.678 --> 00:01:20.247
HE'S TAKING A BIG RISK.
