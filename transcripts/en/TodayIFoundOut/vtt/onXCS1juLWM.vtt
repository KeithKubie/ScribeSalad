00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.500
Called by some a “vagina wig,” the Oxford
English Dictionary defines the noun, merkin,

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.170
as “an artificial covering of hair for the
female pubic region.”

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.740
And although given the recent popularity of
meticulous waxing and grooming of one’s

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.951
nether regions you may think the merkin must
be a modern invention, in fact, it has actually

00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:32.059
been around for at least five centuries.

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.790
While the OED lists the word’s earliest
appearance at 1617 in John Taylor’s Three

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.600
Weekes Observer as “Mistris Minks recouer
her lost mirkin,” the Oxford Companion to

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.760
the Body dates the actual practice of wearing
a pubic wig to the mid-15th century, and it

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.590
may actually go back much further.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.660
It appears the merkin’s original purpose
was highly practical: women, particularly

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.969
prostitutes, shaved their pubic hair to combat
pubic lice and maintain better hygiene, but

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.050
then for cosmetic reasons, donned the wig
to cover up their bare bits.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.930
Such a wig had the great advantage of also
being easy to remove and clean in a much harsher

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.539
fashion than attached hair, to ensure things
stayed as hygienic as possible.

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:19.180
It’s also often suggested that prostitutes
used merkins to conceal obvious signs of venereal

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.620
disease, but there doesn’t seem to exist
much in the way of any real evidence to support

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.689
this claim.

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.299
And certainly the widely reported rumor today
that it was commonly used to cover syphilis

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.140
is highly unlikely.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.659
Signs of primary syphilis in women often present
on the cervix.

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:40.189
But even if it was covering signs around the
more visible vaginal area in a specific case,

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.950
unless the merkin was covering large portions
of the woman’s body, it wasn’t going to

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.820
be hiding secondary syphilis which can include
rashes on the trunk and extremities, among

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.189
other widespread visual symptoms that ultimately
occur roughly 2-8 weeks after primary syphilis

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.290
rears its microbial head.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:03.040
That’s not to say it’s not possible merkins
were used to hide signs of certain STDs- it

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.190
seems tangible enough, though one would think
if it was a common practice as is often claimed,

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.019
men interested in not getting diseases would
have simply taken a few seconds to check under

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.690
the merkin before doing the deed with a given
prostitute…

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.930
But either way, there doesn’t actually seem
to be much in the way of any documented evidence

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.090
to support this idea, and certainly its widespread
use in hiding syphilis, as is claimed in just

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:31.130
about every modern source we consulted on
the history of merkins, seems highly suspect.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.130
In any event, made of a variety of soft fabrics
or hair, it is also often stated that a popular

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.060
material for merkins historically was beaver
pelt, which is further widely claimed to be

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.690
the origin of the modern use of “beaver”
as a pseudonym for lady parts.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.420
In truth, however, it would seem there was
no such popularity of beaver pelts for merkins,

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.990
with documented examples made of things like
human, horse, or goat hair.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.630
But even if beaver pelts were popular for
this historically (again, documented evidence

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.600
on this is scant, but it’s always possible
beaver pelt merkins were a thing), the first

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.800
known instance of “beaver,” meaning “vagina,”
didn’t appear until 1927 in Immortalia by

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.000
“A Gentleman About Town”, where it states,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.190
There was a young lady named Eva
Filled up the bath tub to receiv-a;

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.170
She took off her clothes
From her head to her toes,

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.199
And a voice at the keyhole yelled, “Beaver!”

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:25.329
Given this is a relatively modern slang term
for lady bits, the popularity of merkins had

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:29.699
severely waned by the 20th century, and there
is no documented connection between these

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:34.400
early references and the merkin, it seems
unlikely that the “beaver” slang term

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.370
had anything to do with merkins.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.710
As for where the word “merkin,” itself
came from, this isn’t clear either.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:45.150
It has been speculated (including in the OED)
that it derives from malkin, a nickname for

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.510
women named “Mary” and “Maud”- particularly
used with lower class women- that was first

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.790
recorded in the late 13th century, but this
is noted as being just speculation.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.570
In the end, likely due to the uncouth nature
of the subject matter making it not exactly

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.290
something that was widely documented historically,
tracing the history of merkins, and even how

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:09.090
they actually attached them centuries ago,
is something of an effort in futility.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:18.470
That said, we do know merkins remained popular
through the 18th century and some, particularly

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.220
those worn by more affluent women, were even
richly decorated with ribbon, jewelry, flowers

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.910
and other embellishments, to help pretty them
up.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.070
As for today, while the merkin has long been
mostly a relic of history, they’re still

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.700
around in some circles largely because of
the trend to go bare or very closely cut.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.161
For example, it is reported that in The Reader
(2008), actress Kate Winslet was having a

00:04:41.161 --> 00:04:45.090
bit of trouble growing out her pubic hair
to the satisfactory of the filmmakers (owing

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.040
to, as she put it, “years of waxing”),
so they had a merkin made to cover “her

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.040
more modern grooming.”

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.860
Winslet, however, didn’t care for the thing
and stated in an interview she told them,

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.210
“Guys, I am going to have to draw the line
at a pubic wig, but you can shoot my own snatch

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.780
up close and personal.”

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.440
On that note, beyond trying to make the grooming
of hair down there more accurate to the era

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.660
a film might be depicting, the use of merkins
among bare actresses today is also helpful

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.160
when trying to avoid ratings like NC-17 for
a film.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.220
If the actress’ nether regions are sufficiently
concealed by hair, the MPAA will probably

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.840
look the other way and give a film a less
restrictive rating, depending on how exactly

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.780
said region is shown in the movie.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.400
If the bare lady bits are shown, however,
even briefly, getting a less restrictive rating

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.010
is much less likely.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.330
Thus, erring on the side of caution, most
directors will instruct the bare among us

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.460
to either grow it out for nude scenes or put
on a merkin.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.590
If you’ve ever seen the famed film Dr. Strangelove,
you might now have new appreciation for the

00:05:45.590 --> 00:06:10.570
name of the character of the President- Merkin
Muffley…
