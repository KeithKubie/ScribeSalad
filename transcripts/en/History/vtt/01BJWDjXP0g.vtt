00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:01.710
- How are you doing?

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:02.500
JARED: Good, how are you?

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.210
I'm pretty good.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.710
JARED: I've got something I
think you'll be interested in.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.620
"From Russia with Love," huh?

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.880
JARED: Well, that
gun that Sean Connery

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.880
held in the promotional shots--

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.880
Oh, wow.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:16.830
You mind if I check it out?

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.040
JARED: Sure.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.880
It's pretty cool, man.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.250
What do you think?

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.580
JARED: I think you
need to wear a tux.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.250
Yeah, I don't wear tuxes, man.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.420
[laughter]

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.710
JARED: I have owned
this Walther pellet

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.170
gun for about nine years.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.750
A friend of mine
that passed away,

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.420
actually, was the owner of
it, and he left it to me.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.920
Walther makes other guns,
but this, I understand,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.380
was the first pellet
gun they ever made.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.920
I'm trying to get $500
for my Walther pellet gun,

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.500
and I've kind of decided
that's the least I would take

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.330
would be $300.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.080
Yeah, this is a pretty
interesting story, actually.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.380
Sean Connery went to
the promotional shoots

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.250
for "From Russia with Love,"
and they didn't have the gun

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.000
he was supposed to shoot with.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.670
So by chance, I guess the
photographer happened to have

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.380
this Walther in his car.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.120
So he went and got
it and thus, became

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.580
the famous picture that
everyone knows from the movie.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.540
It's pretty cool, man.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.120
What do you know about it?

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.750
JARED: Well, they've resold
the one that Sean Connery

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.420
used twice that I found.
- OK.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.040
JARED: Once about
10 years ago or so,

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.620
for over a half million dollars.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.080
And they resold it last year
again for about $200,000.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.620
So I wasn't looking for
quite that much, but--

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.920
Yeah, I hope you're
not, because I'm

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.080
going to send you on your way.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.620
[laughter]

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.420
Pretty much everybody
knows about James Bond.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.790
And I know a lot of people
think Sean Connery was one

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.960
of the best bonds
of the franchise,

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.080
but we're not looking
at the golden gun here.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.920
And even though
this one is cool,

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.460
it's not the one that
was used in the movie.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.460
So how much do you want for it?

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.460
JARED: I'd like to
get $500 for it.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.830
[sighs]

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:47.620
Oh, man.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.670
I don't know.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.670
JARED: I think it's worth $500.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.290
They're pretty rare.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.290
The thing is, I just don't
think people are out there

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.830
collecting this
pistol, or they would

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.000
just be on the market more.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.920
I'm looking more like $150.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.290
Oh, I couldn't go that low.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.120
I could come down to $400.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.460
I'm going [inaudible]
my best offer at $200.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.830
I would sell it
today for $250,

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.670
but I can't sell it
for any less than that.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.790
For $200, I'd love it, but
for $250, it's just not right.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:18.960
I understand.
All right.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.080
All right.
JARED: Thank you.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.000
See ya later.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.330
JARED: I'm not
bothered a whole lot.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.460
If I can't get $250
for it, I'll just

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.210
try to sell it
myself someplace else

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.210
because I think I
can get the money.
