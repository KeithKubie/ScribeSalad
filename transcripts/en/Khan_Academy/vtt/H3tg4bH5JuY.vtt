00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:01.819
Narrator: Ever since
people have been lending

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:03.338
money to each other there has been

00:00:03.338 --> 00:00:04.654
one fundamental problem.

00:00:04.654 --> 00:00:07.151
What happens when someone can't pay back

00:00:07.151 --> 00:00:08.602
their debts?

00:00:08.602 --> 00:00:11.545
(writing) Can't pay back.

00:00:11.545 --> 00:00:13.432
What are you going to do?

00:00:13.432 --> 00:00:16.532
Before I really jump into what we do now

00:00:16.532 --> 00:00:18.426
in our modern society,
let's get a couple of

00:00:18.426 --> 00:00:21.344
the words out of the way
we're going to use a lot.

00:00:21.344 --> 00:00:22.597
These are words that you'll hear a lot

00:00:22.597 --> 00:00:25.596
in the context of debt or
in the context of loans.

00:00:25.596 --> 00:00:30.349
On one side of the transaction
you have the debtor.

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.064
This is essentially the person that

00:00:32.064 --> 00:00:33.605
borrowed the money.

00:00:33.605 --> 00:00:36.768
(writing) Borrowed money.

00:00:36.768 --> 00:00:38.263
And because they borrowed the money,

00:00:38.263 --> 00:00:40.329
they now owe money, so you can either say

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:43.433
they borrowed the money
or that they owe money.

00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:45.325
(writing) They owe the money.

00:00:45.325 --> 00:00:46.728
On the other side of the transaction

00:00:46.728 --> 00:00:50.466
you have the creditor.

00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:51.673
(writing) creditor.

00:00:51.673 --> 00:00:54.594
This is the entity or
the person that is owed

00:00:54.594 --> 00:00:58.263
the money or they lent
the money to the borrower.

00:00:58.263 --> 00:01:02.091
(writing) They lend the money.

00:01:02.091 --> 00:01:03.670
They lend the money.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.923
We have our words out of the way,

00:01:04.923 --> 00:01:07.596
but let's go back to our
fundamental question.

00:01:07.596 --> 00:01:10.195
What happens when the debtor can't pay

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:12.928
the creditor back the
money that they creditor

00:01:12.928 --> 00:01:14.673
is apparently due?

00:01:14.673 --> 00:01:18.453
If we go back through human history

00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:21.056
they've come up with various solutions

00:01:21.056 --> 00:01:23.755
to this problem, we can call it.

00:01:23.755 --> 00:01:26.265
If you go back to ancient Greece,

00:01:26.265 --> 00:01:29.001
(writing) Ancient Greece

00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:31.665
they had a very simple solution to it.

00:01:31.665 --> 00:01:34.570
The debtor, if the debtor
can't pay back their debts

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.803
well then, become a debt
slave to the creditor.

00:01:38.803 --> 00:01:41.645
(writing) They became a debt slave.

00:01:41.645 --> 00:01:44.332
If the creditor needs some gardening done,

00:01:44.332 --> 00:01:46.904
or would like his or her house cleaned

00:01:46.904 --> 00:01:49.232
more regularly, the debtor and actually

00:01:49.232 --> 00:01:51.806
probably the debtors
family would have then

00:01:51.806 --> 00:01:54.726
had to do whatever the
creditor wanted until they

00:01:54.726 --> 00:01:57.866
essentially pay back their
debt through their labor.

00:01:57.866 --> 00:01:59.489
That's how Greece handled it, if you know

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:01.729
it's kind of shocking to us now,

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:02.984
but that was their solution.

00:02:02.984 --> 00:02:04.882
You decided to borrow
money, you can't pay it

00:02:04.882 --> 00:02:06.798
anymore, this is what you've got to do.

00:02:06.798 --> 00:02:09.328
Now, if we fast forward a little bit

00:02:09.328 --> 00:02:12.123
to maybe Medieval Europe, this is even

00:02:12.123 --> 00:02:15.719
Charles Dickens' father
was even caught into this

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:20.858
kind of a bind, but until
the early or mid 1800s

00:02:20.858 --> 00:02:22.985
in Europe and the United
States you had the notion

00:02:22.985 --> 00:02:25.614
of debtors prison.

00:02:25.614 --> 00:02:30.457
(writing) Debtors prison.

00:02:30.457 --> 00:02:33.858
Frankly, when I describe this to you,

00:02:33.858 --> 00:02:35.320
you'll find that it's
even worse in my mind

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.726
then being a debt slave.

00:02:36.726 --> 00:02:39.455
In debtors prison they
would throw you in jail,

00:02:39.455 --> 00:02:42.454
they would throw you ...
they would imprison you,

00:02:42.454 --> 00:02:44.320
that's why it's called debtors prison

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.787
and you're not coming
out until your family

00:02:46.787 --> 00:02:48.986
pays off your debt.

00:02:48.986 --> 00:02:53.127
(writing) your family
or maybe your friends,

00:02:53.127 --> 00:02:56.277
if you have good friends,
pays off your debt.

00:02:56.277 --> 00:02:59.199
(writing) off your debt.

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:02.595
Just thinking about why
this is especially horrible,

00:03:02.595 --> 00:03:04.520
at least here you had
your chance to work off

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.788
your debt.

00:03:05.788 --> 00:03:10.420
Here if your family either,
in my situation right now,

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.593
if I get thrown in prison
will my 10-month-old son

00:03:13.593 --> 00:03:15.009
be able to pay off my debt?

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:17.005
No, I'm just going to
rot in prison forever

00:03:17.005 --> 00:03:18.519
or what if my family doesn't like me

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.856
or what if I have no family or friends,

00:03:20.856 --> 00:03:23.253
just for ... I might have owed someone the

00:03:23.253 --> 00:03:25.454
equivalent of now of
$1,000 and because of that

00:03:25.454 --> 00:03:27.255
I could serve a life sentence in prison.

00:03:27.255 --> 00:03:29.745
You could imagine the debtors prison

00:03:29.745 --> 00:03:31.661
could be quite harsh and, actually,

00:03:31.661 --> 00:03:35.004
Charles Dickens' dad
was in debtors prison.

00:03:35.004 --> 00:03:37.734
It can kind of tell you
a little bit about why

00:03:37.734 --> 00:03:39.595
he writes the type of books that he does.

00:03:39.595 --> 00:03:42.065
Anyway, this is the past,
we are now a civilized

00:03:42.065 --> 00:03:44.335
society and hopefully we have a better way

00:03:44.335 --> 00:03:46.936
of dealing with the
situation when a debtor

00:03:46.936 --> 00:03:49.400
owes a creditor money.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.982
That's the topic of this video.

00:03:51.982 --> 00:03:55.943
Now what we do is something
called bankruptcy.

00:03:55.943 --> 00:03:57.868
Just so you know, the first
versions of bankruptcy

00:03:57.868 --> 00:03:59.534
weren't that different
from debtors prison.

00:03:59.534 --> 00:04:01.202
They are actually more
to protect the creditor

00:04:01.202 --> 00:04:03.663
then to protect the
debtor, but now we have

00:04:03.663 --> 00:04:05.870
bankruptcy laws and for
the most part they're

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.004
to prevent this type of
craziness or for someone

00:04:08.004 --> 00:04:09.668
to spend their entire life on kind of this

00:04:09.668 --> 00:04:12.462
wacky debt treadmill.

00:04:12.462 --> 00:04:15.376
Let's talk a little bit about bankruptcy.

00:04:15.376 --> 00:04:17.786
I'm going to focus on bankruptcy as it is

00:04:17.786 --> 00:04:19.541
in the United States.

00:04:19.541 --> 00:04:22.625
Let me write down
bankruptcy in a new color.

00:04:22.625 --> 00:04:28.039
(writing) Bankruptcy, bankruptcy.

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:30.699
It's going to have a U.S. focus.

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:31.818
In general I'm going to talk about

00:04:31.818 --> 00:04:33.752
personal bankruptcy,
although a lot of what

00:04:33.752 --> 00:04:35.719
I talk about, on some level,
applies to corporations

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:36.722
as well.

00:04:36.722 --> 00:04:39.259
I've actually made videos on that as well.

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:42.260
Let's say I'm just overwhelmed with debt.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.786
I have $100,000 of credit card loans,

00:04:45.786 --> 00:04:52.009
I have a mortgage to
pay, I have a car lease

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:53.586
that was a little bit over my head

00:04:53.586 --> 00:04:54.853
what can I do?

00:04:54.853 --> 00:04:57.588
There's a couple of options
in the United States.

00:04:57.588 --> 00:05:00.391
You have Chapter 7, it
seems very complicated,

00:05:00.391 --> 00:05:02.786
these are all different,
literally, chapters of the

00:05:02.786 --> 00:05:04.908
bankruptcy code.

00:05:04.908 --> 00:05:08.058
(writing) You have chapter 7.

00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:11.652
This is called a straight bankruptcy.

00:05:11.652 --> 00:05:14.049
This is literally you
go ... it's not a simple

00:05:14.049 --> 00:05:16.095
procedure, but the gist
of it is you go to the

00:05:16.095 --> 00:05:17.911
bankruptcy courts and
you say look I can't pay

00:05:17.911 --> 00:05:18.887
back my debts.

00:05:18.887 --> 00:05:20.474
What they're going to do
is they're going to take

00:05:20.474 --> 00:05:24.332
my assets and then
whatever there is there,

00:05:24.332 --> 00:05:26.556
they're going to split
it amongst my creditors

00:05:26.556 --> 00:05:28.667
and then after all is said and done,

00:05:28.667 --> 00:05:31.886
I don't owe anyone anything,
although I've lost a lot

00:05:31.886 --> 00:05:32.926
of my assets.

00:05:32.926 --> 00:05:34.113
Some of them are exempt, they let you keep

00:05:34.113 --> 00:05:37.066
things that you need to live
like your pots and pans,

00:05:37.066 --> 00:05:40.328
and maybe one television,
and maybe a suit so that

00:05:40.328 --> 00:05:43.333
you can find a job, but
if I have a bank account,

00:05:43.333 --> 00:05:46.330
I probably don't because
I got so deep into debt.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.622
But if I have some money,
if I have a nice diamond

00:05:50.622 --> 00:05:53.472
ring or a Rolex watch,
they're going to take that

00:05:53.472 --> 00:05:56.260
from me and the trustee,
the bankruptcy court

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.133
is going to take that from me, sell it

00:05:58.133 --> 00:06:00.328
and then give it to all my creditors,

00:06:00.328 --> 00:06:02.536
but at the end of the day
after all is said and done

00:06:02.536 --> 00:06:05.196
I'll actually be free of all of my debt.

00:06:05.196 --> 00:06:08.888
It's kind of a way to
break from this cycle

00:06:08.888 --> 00:06:12.061
of always owing money
and always just barely

00:06:12.061 --> 00:06:14.549
making it or probably
not making it at all.

00:06:14.549 --> 00:06:16.064
That's a straight bankruptcy.

00:06:16.064 --> 00:06:19.065
I say why doesn't everyone
do that who's under

00:06:19.065 --> 00:06:21.666
a big heavy load of debt,
well one there's a lot of

00:06:21.666 --> 00:06:24.803
rules that make this easy
or not so easy to do,

00:06:24.803 --> 00:06:27.217
but the other thing is it
stays on your credit report

00:06:27.217 --> 00:06:29.398
for 10 years.

00:06:29.398 --> 00:06:34.874
(writing) 10 years on credit report.

00:06:34.874 --> 00:06:36.546
So, you've got to think to yourself,

00:06:36.546 --> 00:06:39.137
am I going to be better
off over the next 10 years

00:06:39.137 --> 00:06:41.207
continuing to pay off my debt?

00:06:41.207 --> 00:06:42.962
If I can pay off my debt,
if I have any chance

00:06:42.962 --> 00:06:45.070
I should probably do
that so that I don't ruin

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:46.882
my credit for the next 10 years,

00:06:46.882 --> 00:06:48.337
but if it's just a hopeless situation

00:06:48.337 --> 00:06:50.218
I might as well do it.

00:06:50.218 --> 00:06:52.212
Just so you know, this
isn't a cure for everything.

00:06:52.212 --> 00:06:55.007
If you've got ... If
you're sitting on $300,000

00:06:55.007 --> 00:06:58.005
of student loans, I say,
wow, let me just ...

00:06:58.005 --> 00:06:59.796
that's going to take me
more than 10 years to pay

00:06:59.796 --> 00:07:02.880
anyway, let me just declare
Chapter 7 bankruptcy,

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.857
it will be unfortunate to find out that

00:07:05.857 --> 00:07:09.213
student loans cannot be forgiven in

00:07:09.213 --> 00:07:10.883
a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.

00:07:10.883 --> 00:07:13.734
There's a whole set of types of loans,

00:07:13.734 --> 00:07:15.993
or I guess you could say
types of liabilities,

00:07:15.993 --> 00:07:17.403
things you owe to other people that

00:07:17.403 --> 00:07:19.732
cannot be forgiven;
certain types of taxes,

00:07:19.732 --> 00:07:23.268
student loans, child support, those won't

00:07:23.268 --> 00:07:24.340
be forgiven.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.135
This will definitely
apply to things maybe like

00:07:26.135 --> 00:07:27.541
credit card loans.

00:07:27.541 --> 00:07:29.934
This isn't just a very,
very simple process,

00:07:29.934 --> 00:07:32.003
so any of these things that I talk about

00:07:32.003 --> 00:07:35.002
you definitely want to
consult an expert on your

00:07:35.002 --> 00:07:37.737
particular situation to get
a little bit more detail.

00:07:37.737 --> 00:07:39.196
This is just an overview.

00:07:39.196 --> 00:07:41.210
That's Chapter 7 straight up bankruptcy.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.936
I don't have what it
takes to keep servicing

00:07:43.936 --> 00:07:46.382
my debt, I want a brand new start.

00:07:46.382 --> 00:07:49.550
Now, the next one, or
the next one you're going

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:54.068
to hear the most about in
the context of a personal

00:07:54.068 --> 00:07:58.086
bankruptcy is Chapter 13.

00:07:58.086 --> 00:08:01.600
(writing) Chapter 13.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.980
This is often referred
to as a reorganization.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:09.667
(writing) reorganization.

00:08:09.667 --> 00:08:13.224
Here the idea is, look, I have a salary,

00:08:13.224 --> 00:08:16.559
I have a job, but I
just have more debt then

00:08:16.559 --> 00:08:18.000
is imaginable.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.071
It might not be just because
I've been irresponsible,

00:08:20.071 --> 00:08:22.669
maybe a medical emergency
came up in the family

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:25.145
or I had some unknown expenses that just

00:08:25.145 --> 00:08:26.606
popped up out of nowhere.

00:08:26.606 --> 00:08:30.893
So, here the situation
is, look Mr. Creditors

00:08:30.893 --> 00:08:33.893
out there, I really do
want to pay you back,

00:08:33.893 --> 00:08:36.941
but what you're asking
for me to do right now

00:08:36.941 --> 00:08:38.313
is just crazy.

00:08:38.313 --> 00:08:39.834
If you ask me to do that I'm just going to

00:08:39.834 --> 00:08:41.334
end up in Chapter 7 eventually,

00:08:41.334 --> 00:08:46.132
so for both my sake, me as the debtor,

00:08:46.132 --> 00:08:48.481
both for my sake and for your sake,

00:08:48.481 --> 00:08:50.800
why don't we come up
with a plan so that I can

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.976
realistically, so that I can realistically

00:08:52.976 --> 00:08:55.533
pay you over the next 3 to 5 years.

00:08:55.533 --> 00:08:58.002
That might involve you saying, hey

00:08:58.002 --> 00:09:01.148
instead of being owed
$50,000 you now owe me

00:09:01.148 --> 00:09:03.549
$40,000 or instead of
the interest being on my

00:09:03.549 --> 00:09:06.188
credit card being 20% a
year, let's change that

00:09:06.188 --> 00:09:07.855
to 10% a year, so there
will be a little bit

00:09:07.855 --> 00:09:09.250
of a negotiation.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:11.164
You're going to have
to come up with a plan

00:09:11.164 --> 00:09:12.583
and once you come up with that plan,

00:09:12.583 --> 00:09:15.852
I've got to pay that over
the next 3 to 5 years.

00:09:15.852 --> 00:09:17.664
(writing) 3 to 5 years.

00:09:17.664 --> 00:09:19.519
Once again, you might say
hey that's pretty good,

00:09:19.519 --> 00:09:22.386
if I owe $100,000 in credit card debt

00:09:22.386 --> 00:09:24.999
and I kind of go to my creditors

00:09:24.999 --> 00:09:28.515
and look like a genuine individual

00:09:28.515 --> 00:09:31.294
and make a nice sob story
they're going to lower

00:09:31.294 --> 00:09:33.422
my debt, I'll be better
off then if I didn't do it.

00:09:33.422 --> 00:09:36.203
Here again, there's a penalty to doing it

00:09:36.203 --> 00:09:39.712
and once again it shows
up on your credit report.

00:09:39.712 --> 00:09:42.670
In general, they're going
to come up with a plan

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:45.483
for you to pay back your
creditors over 3 years

00:09:45.483 --> 00:09:47.755
and then after that it's
going to show up on your

00:09:47.755 --> 00:09:50.315
credit report for another 7 years.

00:09:50.315 --> 00:09:57.618
(writing) 7 years on credit,
on your credit report.

00:09:58.809 --> 00:10:01.042
So in general from the time you file until

00:10:01.042 --> 00:10:03.072
the time it leaves your credit report

00:10:03.072 --> 00:10:06.923
it's going to be 10 years,
just like Chapter 7.

00:10:06.923 --> 00:10:09.664
In either of these situations
these aren't things

00:10:09.664 --> 00:10:11.256
that you want to just jump into

00:10:11.256 --> 00:10:14.839
and think, wow, I've found
an easy out from my debt.

00:10:14.839 --> 00:10:16.502
These are very serious
things that will impact you

00:10:16.502 --> 00:10:21.005
for a reasonable chunk of your life,

00:10:21.005 --> 00:10:22.859
so these aren't just simple things to do.

00:10:22.859 --> 00:10:25.340
They are good to know
about just in case you do

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.728
find yourself a little bit over your head,

00:10:27.728 --> 00:10:29.925
or a little bit underwater
or you know someone

00:10:29.925 --> 00:10:32.465
who's in this situation,
at least it is an out

00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:34.672
where they can feel that,
look, if I do this or that

00:10:34.672 --> 00:10:38.055
then maybe over the next
either 3 years or 10 years

00:10:38.055 --> 00:10:41.223
depending on how you
view it, they can get to

00:10:41.223 --> 00:10:42.796
a new start.

00:10:42.796 --> 00:10:46.085
Just so you have a sense
of how often this occurs,

00:10:46.085 --> 00:10:48.858
I looked this up a little bit earlier.

00:10:48.858 --> 00:10:51.507
In the U.S., in the U.S.,
and as you can imagine

00:10:51.507 --> 00:10:53.003
we're in the middle of a recession now,

00:10:53.003 --> 00:10:55.798
so bankruptcy filings are
going through the roof,

00:10:55.798 --> 00:10:57.590
so let me write this down.

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.751
This is Chpater 7.

00:10:59.751 --> 00:11:04.789
(writing) Chapter 7 and here's Chapter 13.

00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:06.524
If you're wondering what
are all the Chapters

00:11:06.524 --> 00:11:08.989
in between, there's a Chapter 12 which is

00:11:08.989 --> 00:11:12.334
essentially Chapter 13
for farmers and fishermen,

00:11:12.334 --> 00:11:14.391
they get a few more benefits
than the rest of us get,

00:11:14.391 --> 00:11:16.062
just because we want to promote,

00:11:16.062 --> 00:11:18.388
I guess people who produce food.

00:11:18.388 --> 00:11:21.053
Then there is Chapter
11 which is essentially

00:11:21.053 --> 00:11:23.789
business reorganization,
it can apply to some

00:11:23.789 --> 00:11:26.853
individuals who are essentially big shots,

00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:29.670
their personal portfolios of assets

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:32.000
and liabilities look
a lot like a business,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.257
so for them Chapter 11
will be more appropriate

00:11:34.257 --> 00:11:35.592
than Chapter 13.

00:11:35.592 --> 00:11:37.796
Those are kind of the two other Chapters.

00:11:37.796 --> 00:11:40.105
From a personal bankruptcy point of view,

00:11:40.105 --> 00:11:43.017
Chapter 7 and Chapter
13 is what most people

00:11:43.017 --> 00:11:44.430
concern themselves with.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:46.653
Now just to give you
the numbers of how often

00:11:46.653 --> 00:11:49.386
this is occurring, just
if you find yourself

00:11:49.386 --> 00:11:51.062
in this circumstance,
just so you know that

00:11:51.062 --> 00:11:53.589
you're not necessarily
alone and also just to see

00:11:53.589 --> 00:11:55.898
that they really are increasing right now.

00:11:55.898 --> 00:12:00.244
(writing) 2007, 2008, 2009.

00:12:00.467 --> 00:12:04.470
Chapter 7 filings in the
United States in 2007,

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:10.257
413,000, in 2008 it went up to 560,000.

00:12:10.257 --> 00:12:12.877
This is a more than a 25% increase.

00:12:12.877 --> 00:12:18.327
Then in 2009 819,000
filings, essentially double

00:12:18.327 --> 00:12:22.870
of the number of Chapter
7 filings in 2007.

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:28.546
If you look at Chapter
13, in 2007 we had 277,000

00:12:28.546 --> 00:12:31.811
filings, so for every 2
Chapter 7's there looks like

00:12:31.811 --> 00:12:33.765
there's about ... well
for every 4 there's about

00:12:33.765 --> 00:12:35.006
3 of these.

00:12:35.006 --> 00:12:40.933
Then we have 334,000 in
2008 and then 370,000

00:12:40.933 --> 00:12:42.261
in 2009.

00:12:42.261 --> 00:12:44.129
You can see that the
Chapter 7 ones are ...

00:12:44.129 --> 00:12:45.503
I mean they are both
increasing really fast,

00:12:45.503 --> 00:12:47.596
but Chapter 7 is even more dramatic.

00:12:47.596 --> 00:12:49.597
You can imagine because
in a situation where

00:12:49.597 --> 00:12:52.827
people don't have jobs,
Chapter 13 really isn't

00:12:52.827 --> 00:12:55.332
that viable of an option,
they really have to

00:12:55.332 --> 00:12:57.831
do something like Chapter 7.

00:12:57.831 --> 00:12:59.827
Anyway, hopefully you found that useful

00:12:59.827 --> 00:13:03.651
and you know a little
bit about bankruptcy now.
