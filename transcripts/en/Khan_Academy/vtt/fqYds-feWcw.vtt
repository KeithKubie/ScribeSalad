00:00:00.331 --> 00:00:02.053
- [Voiceover] Let's say
that y is equal to seven

00:00:02.053 --> 00:00:05.751
to the x squared minus x power.

00:00:05.751 --> 00:00:10.176
What is the derivative
of y, derivative of y,

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:11.676
with respect to x?

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:14.225
And like always, pause this video

00:00:14.225 --> 00:00:16.542
and see if you can figure it out.

00:00:16.542 --> 00:00:19.766
Well, based on how this has
been color-coded ahead of time,

00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:21.413
you might immediately recognize that

00:00:21.413 --> 00:00:23.845
this is a composite function,
or it could be viewed

00:00:23.845 --> 00:00:25.675
as a composite function.

00:00:25.675 --> 00:00:29.842
If you had a v of x, which
if you had a function v of x,

00:00:31.581 --> 00:00:35.097
which is equal to seven to the xth power,

00:00:35.097 --> 00:00:37.750
and you had another function u of x,

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.181
u of x which is equal
to x squared minus x,

00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:44.274
then what we have right over here,

00:00:44.274 --> 00:00:47.274
y, y is equal to seven to something,

00:00:49.605 --> 00:00:53.605
so it's equal to v of,
and it's not just v of x,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.685
it's v of u of x, instead of an x here

00:00:56.685 --> 00:00:59.167
you have the whole function u of x,

00:00:59.167 --> 00:01:00.921
x squared minus x.

00:01:00.921 --> 00:01:05.807
So, it's v of u of x and
the chain rule tells us

00:01:05.807 --> 00:01:09.234
that the derivative of
y with respect to x,

00:01:09.234 --> 00:01:11.048
and you'll see different notations here,

00:01:11.048 --> 00:01:13.240
sometimes you'll see it
written as the derivative

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.907
of v with respect to
u, so v prime of u of x

00:01:18.493 --> 00:01:21.326
times the derivative
of u with respect to x,

00:01:21.326 --> 00:01:23.014
so that's one way you could do it,

00:01:23.014 --> 00:01:26.293
or you could say that this is equal to,

00:01:26.293 --> 00:01:30.907
this is equal to the
derivative, the derivative of v

00:01:30.907 --> 00:01:35.074
with respect to x, sorry,
derivative of v with respect to u,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.367
d v d u times the derivative
of u with respect to x,

00:01:44.073 --> 00:01:46.906
derivative of u with respect to x,

00:01:48.732 --> 00:01:52.081
and so either way we can
apply that right over here.

00:01:52.081 --> 00:01:55.392
So, what's the derivative
of v with respect to u?

00:01:55.392 --> 00:01:57.640
What is v prime of u of x?

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.975
Well, we know, we know,
let me actually write it

00:02:00.975 --> 00:02:04.583
right over here, if v of x is
equal to seven to the x power

00:02:04.583 --> 00:02:07.952
v prime of x would be equal
to, and we've proved this

00:02:07.952 --> 00:02:11.048
in other videos where we
take derivatives exponentials

00:02:11.048 --> 00:02:14.191
of bases other than e, this
going to be the natural log

00:02:14.191 --> 00:02:17.441
of seven times seven to the x power.

00:02:19.163 --> 00:02:22.277
So, if we are taking v prime of u of x,

00:02:22.277 --> 00:02:24.696
then notice instead of an x everywhere,

00:02:24.696 --> 00:02:26.735
we're going to have a u of x everywhere.

00:02:26.735 --> 00:02:29.310
So, this right over
here, this is going to be

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.643
natural log of seven times seven to the,

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.021
instead of saying seven to the x power,

00:02:36.021 --> 00:02:38.426
remember we're taking v prime of u of x,

00:02:38.426 --> 00:02:42.593
so it's going to be seven to
the x squared minus x power,

00:02:44.101 --> 00:02:47.518
x squared, x squared minus x power,

00:02:48.698 --> 00:02:52.094
and then we want to multiply
that times the derivative of u

00:02:52.094 --> 00:02:53.712
with respect to x.

00:02:53.712 --> 00:02:57.333
So, u prime of x, well, that's going to be

00:02:57.333 --> 00:03:00.718
two x to the first which
is just two x minus one,

00:03:00.718 --> 00:03:04.022
so we're going to
multiply this times two x,

00:03:04.022 --> 00:03:07.439
two x minus one, so there you have it,

00:03:08.602 --> 00:03:12.312
that is the derivative
of y with respect to x.

00:03:12.312 --> 00:03:14.655
You could, we could try to simplify this

00:03:14.655 --> 00:03:17.130
or I guess re-express
it in different ways,

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.909
but the main thing to realize is, look,

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:20.870
we're just gonna take the
derivative of the seven

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.385
to the this to the u of x
power with respect to u of x.

00:03:24.385 --> 00:03:26.550
So, we treat the u of x the
way that we would've treated

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.691
an x right over here, so it's
gonna be natural log of seven

00:03:29.691 --> 00:03:32.306
times seven to the u of x power,

00:03:32.306 --> 00:03:34.980
we take that and multiply
that times u prime of x,

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.064
and once again this is just

00:03:36.064 --> 00:03:38.814
an application of the chain rule.
