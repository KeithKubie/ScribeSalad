00:00:01.075 --> 00:00:02.708
Today I came to work by car.

00:00:02.768 --> 00:00:06.308
In the future, this will surely
be very different.

00:00:06.368 --> 00:00:09.784
I’ll be brought to work
by a self-driving car.

00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:12.840
My name is Alexandre Nogueira.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.664
I am a Computer Engineer,

00:00:14.724 --> 00:00:18.882
and study Self-Driving Car Engineer
Nanodegree at Udacity.

00:00:19.731 --> 00:00:24.090
My first job was at Ericsson
and I’ve been working there ever since.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.218
I worked with system development
and project management,

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:31.840
and lately with new business
development.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.431
After many years, I was working
at Ericsson as a consultant,

00:00:35.491 --> 00:00:38.278
and I became a father
to two little girls,

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:41.470
and my life changed quite a bit.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.971
When they grew up,

00:00:43.031 --> 00:00:48.179
I discovered I had
a lot of time on my hands.

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.728
I decided to fill this time
by going back to school.

00:00:52.788 --> 00:00:58.679
I was very interested in
Udacity’s Self-Driving Car program,

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.915
and I thought that it was time
to have a technical understanding

00:01:03.975 --> 00:01:10.642
of how self-driving cars work
to be part of this revolution.

00:01:10.702 --> 00:01:13.010
I haven’t stopped studying since

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.450
and have discovered that studying
is a great career booster.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.942
The knowledge I develop here
with Udacity’s Nanodegree

00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:24.974
allows me to help the company
develop new businesses

00:01:25.034 --> 00:01:27.582
in other emerging areas.

00:01:27.642 --> 00:01:30.387
I am also learning
about new possibilities:

00:01:30.447 --> 00:01:32.515
What can we provide the market

00:01:32.575 --> 00:01:35.962
that is definitely technically
grounded?

00:01:36.022 --> 00:01:40.078
When you understand something
that is very advanced and complex,

00:01:40.138 --> 00:01:43.943
it allows you to work
with simpler things more easily.

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:48.583
Self-driving cars will bring
more ease,

00:01:48.643 --> 00:01:51.022
they will provide new services,

00:01:51.082 --> 00:01:54.575
and most likely, they will give rise
to new markets

00:01:54.635 --> 00:01:57.264
that we can’t even begin
to imagine right now.

00:01:57.324 --> 00:02:00.208
With more efficiency and simplicity.

00:02:00.268 --> 00:02:03.704
This will surely improve
people’s quality of life.
