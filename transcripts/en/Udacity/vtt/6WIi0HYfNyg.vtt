00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.705
Getting back to our analysis of the variability between samples by looking at

00:00:04.705 --> 00:00:09.241
their means and comparing it to the grand mean, what conclusions can we draw

00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:16.760
after we find these deviations? The greater the distance between sample means,

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.083
the less likely population means will differ significantly. Or is it the

00:00:21.083 --> 00:00:27.380
opposite? The smaller the distance between sample means, the less likely

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.090
population means will differ significantly.
