00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.340
Input processor provides three call
backs for dealing with touches and

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.850
clicks.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.180
Touches and clicks are actually
handled in the same way and

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.300
are just referred to as touches.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.050
Actually, this program I'm drawing
on uses a very similar system

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.790
to determine when to draw the lines.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:17.730
For instance,

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.950
as my pen touches this screen,
a touched down signal is received.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.800
That means it's time to
start drawing a line.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.740
As I move the pen the program is
continually receiving touch dragged

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.330
notifications, meaning that it's time
to draw a little bit more of the line.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.280
Finally, when I reach the end
of my line and I remove the pen,

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.330
there's a touch up call that says
alright stop drawing the line now.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.970
Note that the touch or click coordinates
provided in these call backs

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.080
is always provided in terms
of screen coordinates.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.080
If you want to get the position of
a touch in your world coordinates,

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.400
you will need to convert from
screen to world coordinates.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.370
Let's check out how to do that.
