 MAX CIOCIOLA: My name is Max Ciociola. 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.940
 Is the CEO and founder of musiXmatch 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.000
 My daily work is all about music and lyrics. 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.385
 Listen to the product team's recommendations to create the ultimate experience 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.730
 This app is called musiXmatch 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.470
 Because we aim to match your music to the lyrics 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.880
 We will show you the lyrics when you play the music. 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.159
 So far, we’ve been amazed at the results of our partnership with Google Play. 

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:38.050
 Our app downloads are as high as 27 million, of which more than 16 million are from the Android platform. 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.350
 That is Google Play 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.030
 Up to 10 million active users per month 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.920
 Faster than any other platform 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.580
 The floating lyrics experience is perfectly integrated into 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.330
 Media [inaudible] logo on Android devices 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.830
 This means you don’t even have to open the app 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.530
 Play tracks whenever and where music service 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.900
 You will receive a notification immediately 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.370
 If you touch and open the notification 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.350
 Will see it immediately 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.430
 a lyric overlay that exactly matches the music and is synchronized 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.300
 This means more and more users will use our app. 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.060
 The usage time will be longer and longer, and the interaction will be more and more 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.600
 This is only possible with the Android platform. 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.990
 So far we have found 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.700
 Significant increase in engagement 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.250
 Not only has the number of active users more than doubled 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.804
 Their average time spent in the app has more than doubled 

00:01:31.804 --> 00:01:33.720
 SEBASTIANO GOTTARDO: no doubt 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.960
 Android is a true open system 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.970
 This platform is developing rapidly and well received. 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.940
 You are free to create a variety of applications and features 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.190
 Create endless possibilities 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.150
 For example, on musiXmatch we created a floating lyrics experience 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.890
 This is not possible in any other mobile device operating system. 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.830
 MAX CIOCIOLA: Compared to any other platform 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.955
 The reason why the Android platform is very important to us is 

00:01:53.955 --> 00:01:56.590
 We can respond to each user’s review 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.730
 Communicate directly with them 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.600
 This is a big advantage of the Android platform. 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.620
 Listen to the voice of the user and find a way for them 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.470
 Create a thoughtful experience 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.780
 Chromecast brings a big screen experience you can with friends 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.500
 Sitting around in my living room, watching the lyrics and singing together 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.570
 These experiences have greatly improved the level of interaction 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.100
 In addition to smartphones and tablets 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.600
 Your watch can also display lyrics directly 

00:02:24.847 --> 00:02:26.680
 SEBASTIANO GOTTARDO: Promising for Android TV development 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.920
 Because this platform is not only very useful 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.260
 And we can create a variety of different experiences. 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.630
 This is an exciting opportunity for our application. 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.660
 MAX CIOCIOLA: Our goal is to reach 100 million users 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.480
 The specific method is 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.860
 Take advantage of the technological innovation opportunities available to develop applications on the Android platform 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.220
 And we can’t get this opportunity on other platforms. 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.370
