1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,010
Happen. The Joe Rogan experience.
Do you a I used to live in, in La.

2
00:00:05,011 --> 00:00:08,370
Where are you at now? I moved back
to Hickory, North Carolina. Damn.

3
00:00:08,371 --> 00:00:11,370
I was out here 18 years. Just
couldn't do it anymore. No,

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,490
well it was a couple things.
You know,

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,020
my career has always been like a roller
coaster and good years, bad years. And um,

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,620
I actually just add miss, I miss
my family. I haven't, you know,

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,730
I missed out on a lot growing up, you
know, so, and the market was really good.

8
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:28,380
I had this condo in studio city.

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,810
I bought it for a certain amount and
then it's, it's, it gained value.

10
00:00:33,811 --> 00:00:35,220
And I thought, well, this
is, if I'm going to do this,

11
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:38,120
now's the time to pull the trigger.
And I think I saw you at the,

12
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:42,410
I'm probably not saying I'm Outta
here. I'm bouncing and I, uh, my goal,

13
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,760
the road so much. Right? Yeah.
Well that's the thing too.

14
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,400
And the industry's
changed. Like, you know,

15
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,600
I already have a manager and an agent.

16
00:00:50,601 --> 00:00:53,000
It's not like I need to be here for
every little audition, you know, I'll,

17
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:55,710
I'll put myself on tape.
I got eastbound and down on a tape,

18
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,900
I got Harold and Kumar on a
tape, you know, and then now
the second audition, yeah.

19
00:01:00,901 --> 00:01:04,530
You flop for it. But like,
you know, getting your foot
in the door to that tape.

20
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,720
But I can do that now later.
It's just changed so much.

21
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,810
That's if you want to act and you
do so much stand up on the road,

22
00:01:09,811 --> 00:01:13,140
there's really no reason to be here unless
you just want to perform at the store

23
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:16,010
all the time. That's
right. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh,

24
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:19,740
and I moved back to Hickory and I was
going to get myself a nice lake house in

25
00:01:19,741 --> 00:01:24,480
Lake Hickory. Yup. Still want to do that.
But then as soon as I get home, you know,

26
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:26,370
thanksgiving dad has a stroke.

27
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,250
So I see that happen that you ever seen
someone who had a stroke there when an

28
00:01:31,251 --> 00:01:35,970
APP, I was looking right at him and it
was weird because my dad's a funny guy.

29
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,480
Like I thought maybe because we were
going to eat Thanksgiving dinner late,

30
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,970
like it was like a 6:00 PM thing we were
doing to get other people in the house.

31
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:49,240
And so he was complaining all day about
not eating like I'm hungry. We were,

32
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,580
we were, we going to eat,
we're not going to eat.

33
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,990
And I'm looking around anatomy sitting
next to the fireplace and he just like,

34
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:59,860
he just like nose dives but just head
first right into the hardwood floor.

35
00:01:59,861 --> 00:02:03,480
And it was like pumped. You hear
like a thump. And I was like, Oh,

36
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,380
dad's making a joke. We haven't
eaten yet. It's a, you know,

37
00:02:07,381 --> 00:02:09,660
he's making the thing about like
a low blood sugar or something.

38
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,920
And I was kind of laughing at my
brother's like, no, he hit really hard.

39
00:02:13,921 --> 00:02:16,890
His head hit that floor way
too hard for that to be a jug.

40
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:21,891
And then you walk over to him and arms
curling up one eyes going like that and

41
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:26,700
it's like, this is a stroke. And we called
nine one one they came pretty quick,

42
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:31,170
but they suffered some serious brain
damage right here. And so he's paralyzed.

43
00:02:31,171 --> 00:02:35,340
Was left side now,
but I was in a weird way,

44
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,580
happy that I was at home
when this happened because
you know how was still out

45
00:02:40,891 --> 00:02:44,140
here and that should happen.
Right? Be Be hating life. Yeah.

46
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,370
But the fact that I'm there and
able to help mom out, you know,

47
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,110
going through it all of this,
this whole thing,

48
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,920
because she's got glaucoma and
she's got brittle bones, you know,

49
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,590
she can't physically
lift him up and do stuff.

50
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,980
And the fact that we were in the
house and able to help, it's crazy.

51
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,080
It was, I didn't see the drooping of the
face. I didn't see that happen. You know,

52
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:08,860
that's what people say when you see a
stroke. You see like the drooping happens.

53
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:11,690
Yeah. Like that, that fat
chicken total recall. You know,

54
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,460
let's see. We're at explodes.
Get rid of her. I was surprise.

55
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:20,860
I thought that I thought
that that was why it was,

56
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:23,410
but no,
he just hit the floor.

57
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,850
So have you toured it all since that or
have you just been small places? I can.

58
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,450
I didn't take on extra gigs. I,
but I didn't cancel the ones I had.

59
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:36,220
So the ones that I could drive
to definitely as well. Let me go.

60
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,120
I have a brother who's
there as well, so, um,

61
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,820
but I definitely didn't take
on anything for, you know,

62
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:47,170
since Thanksgiving that
wasn't already there. So yeah,

63
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,090
it's uh,
but he's,

64
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,900
he's at a skilled nursing facility now
and they showed us the X. Right. You know,

65
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:56,290
the, the, the Mri of the brain damage
that happened, he had a collided artery.

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,520
He's got,

67
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:02,520
now he's keeps getting UTI infections
because he has a catheter because it also,

68
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:07,030
it doesn't just fuck with your muscles.
It's the organs on that side too.

69
00:04:07,031 --> 00:04:09,970
So his bladder has got to
relearn how to operate.

70
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,990
So he's got a catheter,
you know, and that,

71
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,870
that that's just opens you up for
Uti infections a lot. And those,

72
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:19,300
I don't know if you know, they're
like Uti infections when you're older.

73
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:24,840
Like it really devastates you, cause you,
you hallucinate. So you see shit. Oh No.

74
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,270
Yeah. And it's weird being in there
and you know, he would like, uh,

75
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,630
I make sure that bears don't out there.
I'm like a bear,

76
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:36,580
like he keeps hearing or think there's
a bear outside the window. So yeah.

77
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,700
That, that was happening
back home for that. But um,

78
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:44,200
are there bears where you live? Not, no,
not, not the skilled nursing facility.

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,170
I mean, there might be some
tweaks. Yeah, no bears.

80
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,560
I allowed to say twink trouble.

81
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,600
He used to be able to just
make a joke about that. What's
dangerous? Yes. Yeah. No,

82
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:03,280
but uh, yeah. Hoping for the best. Still
going through Rehab, occupational therapy,

83
00:05:03,281 --> 00:05:04,150
physical therapy.

84
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,210
Do they think that he'll be able to
recover some function on this left side?

85
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,260
I think you know,

86
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:12,730
that they always want to get dangle a
little bit of light of hope at the end of

87
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:16,360
the talk. I'll Chase's but uh, you know,

88
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,870
some people recover quickly,
some people not at all.

89
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:24,140
Some people three years later can
recover. You need a, here you go. Yeah.

90
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,400
Three years later. I mean,
you know, so we're just still,

91
00:05:27,401 --> 00:05:30,310
we're still doing all of it.
John Singleton just died from a stroke.

92
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,910
That's Rad Shit. Yeah. And
he was, was 51 51. Yeah.

93
00:05:33,911 --> 00:05:37,750
It can happen to anybody at any age.
Luke Perry, same thing. 51 stroke.

94
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:41,890
That's right. Yup. Yeah. Crazy. The
lot of strokes or happened. Fuck man.

95
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,280
I wonder if those folks smoked cigarettes.
Well, my dad definitely did. Yeah, yeah,

96
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,480
yeah. They send in cigarettes,
contribute pretty heavily to strokes.

97
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:53,830
He used to smoke a lot when he was
younger and then quit, you know,

98
00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:58,280
when he was in his late forties.
Um, but that was a lot, you know,

99
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:03,440
in fact in where you'd smoke at 12
years old or something, a whole pack.

100
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:07,250
I don't know if singleton smoked, but
I do know Luke Perry did. Yeah. Yeah.

101
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:09,650
And this woman that I talked
to who is a neurologist,

102
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:12,710
was telling me that that's
a significant factor.

103
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,340
It raises your chances of stroke
pretty significantly. Yeah.

104
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,550
So I'm back in here, cream, but I came,

105
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,560
I'm going to come my
ideas to come out here.

106
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:26,150
You know how that season
keep doing it, right? Yeah.
Right. And then hit the store.

107
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,850
I was there last night was fun. It was
good seeing you, man. You too, man.
