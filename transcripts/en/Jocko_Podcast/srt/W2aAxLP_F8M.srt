1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,260
If you got

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:03,200
okay

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,290
diagnosed with a horrible disease night,

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,060
I tried to think of a better
way to ask you this question,

5
00:00:08,061 --> 00:00:10,370
which isn't like majorly
depressing because this is,

6
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:15,550
but if you got diagnosed with the disease
that was going to kill you in a year

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,350
or 18 months, what would
you do with those months?

8
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,950
I, so I role play this
all the time. Uh, not,

9
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,980
not because I want to dwell the darkness,

10
00:00:29,981 --> 00:00:32,500
but this is part of the rehearsing
the worst case scenario.

11
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,900
So not only do I rehearse this for myself,

12
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:38,170
but I try to spend time around
people who are going to die. Uh,

13
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,030
and when I get back to the bay area,

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,990
actually want to volunteer in a
hospice center to contend with that.

15
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,860
Uh, there are a few things. So I would,

16
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,960
I would get my affairs in
order relatively quickly.

17
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:54,010
They're already largely in order so
that my family would be taken care of.

18
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,430
And to be honest,

19
00:00:57,431 --> 00:00:59,560
and there aren't many points in
my life where I could say this,

20
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:04,110
I would largely keep doing
what I'm doing. Honestly. Uh,

21
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,660
I think that I stopped. For instance,

22
00:01:07,661 --> 00:01:10,480
the tech investing about two years ago,
because I felt like I was replaceable.

23
00:01:10,481 --> 00:01:14,710
I felt like if I in a
sense didn't participate,

24
00:01:14,711 --> 00:01:18,160
there were a hundred other people in
line who are going to step up and write a

25
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:18,790
check.

26
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:23,790
And that wasn't a unique opportunity
nor a unique skill that I held to

27
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:31,270
hopefully put into the world to
benefit people in some way. But, uh,

28
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,460
the, you know, all the
ludicrous experiments,

29
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:38,110
some more practical than others
and the podcasting and so on.

30
00:01:38,111 --> 00:01:41,350
I feel like I'm putting out
the best work that I can and

31
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,233
okay.

32
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,680
I think I'd keep doing
it and I'd certainly end.

33
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,400
And in the last few years I've,

34
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,760
after reading an essay,

35
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,450
I think it's called the tail
end by Tim Urban on wait,

36
00:01:55,451 --> 00:01:59,290
but why about how effectively by the
time you're 18 and leave the house,

37
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:02,830
you've spent 80% of the total hours you
were ever, ever spent with your parents.

38
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:04,241
Uh,

39
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:09,241
I've reorganized my calendar in my year
to spend a lot more time with my family,

40
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,700
meaning my parents and my brother, and

41
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,450
okay.

42
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,350
I think I'd keep doing what
I'm doing. Honestly until,

43
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,580
until I slipped in and up in a pile of
dust, which is where we're all ended up.

44
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:27,120
We were ahead. Sooner or later
I was listening. I should,

45
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:31,850
I keep wanting to do this. I want to,
when I'm listening to certain podcasts,

46
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:33,680
sometimes I want to just live tweet.

47
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,600
Like when I'm having thoughts about them
and I do it with rogue and sometimes I,

48
00:02:37,601 --> 00:02:40,880
I go, man, I should just be live tweeting
this. Cause sometimes when he had,

49
00:02:40,881 --> 00:02:44,150
who do you have on? Oh when? When
he had Sam Harrison. I was just,

50
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,180
there were so many things that they were
saying that were just hilarious to me.

51
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,410
I don't want us to to, but when you
had Shay Carl on that at one point,

52
00:02:51,411 --> 00:02:54,140
I can't remember his
quote, there was this,

53
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,710
you got to this topic and you know,

54
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,760
you know of what you would do and
it wasn't the same question it was,

55
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:02,260
but it was somewhere in the same thing.

56
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,000
Maybe it was about money
and got enough money now,

57
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:08,890
or something along those lines and kind
of at the same time, you know, he says,

58
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,450
he says something like, you know,

59
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:12,520
just imagine being able to spend
all this time with your family.

60
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,170
And then you said at the
same time, cocaine in horse.

61
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,760
I was like, I want to
be alive. That's cool.

62
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:23,810
Yeah.

63
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:28,090
Shane and I had spent a couple of days
together and dusted and which just for

64
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:29,230
those people that don't have any context,

65
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,700
he's also raised a church of Latter
Day saints, you know, Mormon,

66
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,220
Utah. And uh, so I was
like, okay. Then whores,

67
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,970
which is the nature of my
podcast. I loved that was classic.
