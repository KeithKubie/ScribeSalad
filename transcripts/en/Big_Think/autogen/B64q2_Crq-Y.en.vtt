ethical conduct the Ten Commandments are
 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.070
ethical conduct the Ten Commandments are
pretty good and that actually the

a good ethical basis for behavior

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250
a good ethical basis for behavior
 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.929
a good ethical basis for behavior
because actually in the natural state

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939
because actually in the natural state
 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.999
because actually in the natural state
human beings don't behave well they're

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009
human beings don't behave well they're
 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.740
human beings don't behave well they're
quite strongly tempted to behave badly

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750
quite strongly tempted to behave badly
 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.399
quite strongly tempted to behave badly
and we're evolved in ways that that

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409
and we're evolved in ways that that
 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.560
and we're evolved in ways that that
actually encourage bad behavior

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570
actually encourage bad behavior
 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.440

we're designed to kill strangers were

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450
we're designed to kill strangers were
 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.370
we're designed to kill strangers were
designed in fact to steal and so it's

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380
designed in fact to steal and so it's
 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.539
designed in fact to steal and so it's
very important that there should be an

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549
very important that there should be an
 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.700
very important that there should be an
ethical framework within which we live

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710
ethical framework within which we live
 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.069
ethical framework within which we live
and my dilemma is that I don't really

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079
and my dilemma is that I don't really
 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.889
and my dilemma is that I don't really

after that life payoffs but I do believe

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810
after that life payoffs but I do believe
 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.949
after that life payoffs but I do believe
that we should live well we should obey

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959
that we should live well we should obey
 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.290
that we should live well we should obey
some moral code

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300
some moral code
 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.300
some moral code

that we're not likely to invent for
 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.090
that we're not likely to invent for
ourselves so beyond that there are a

ourselves so beyond that there are a
 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.160
ourselves so beyond that there are a
number of other important things that I

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170
number of other important things that I
 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.270
number of other important things that I
believe in I think I believe in the

truth of Darwinian evolution
 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.490

free market as a superior mode of of
economic organization I'm strongly

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990
economic organization I'm strongly
 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.610
economic organization I'm strongly
persuaded by chaos theory about the

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620
persuaded by chaos theory about the
 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.930
persuaded by chaos theory about the
nature of the natural world and the

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940
nature of the natural world and the
 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.820
nature of the natural world and the
nonlinearities that are out there to

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830
nonlinearities that are out there to
 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.610
nonlinearities that are out there to
spoil the Newtonian party but I still

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620
spoil the Newtonian party but I still
 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.490
spoil the Newtonian party but I still
subscribe to Newton's laws of motion I

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500
subscribe to Newton's laws of motion I
 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.020
subscribe to Newton's laws of motion I
believe in all of these things and

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030
believe in all of these things and
 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.580
believe in all of these things and
they're my working assumptions because

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590
they're my working assumptions because
 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.310
they're my working assumptions because
as I said the son of scientists but not

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320
as I said the son of scientists but not
 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.140
as I said the son of scientists but not
a scientist myself I can't challenge

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150
a scientist myself I can't challenge
 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.720
a scientist myself I can't challenge
much of that I guess I take it on trust

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730
much of that I guess I take it on trust
 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.070
much of that I guess I take it on trust
but it does seem to me to hang together

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080
but it does seem to me to hang together
 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.690
but it does seem to me to hang together
reasonably well and for a Nestorian it

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700
reasonably well and for a Nestorian it
 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.200
reasonably well and for a Nestorian it
provides enough of a framework enough of

provides enough of a framework enough of
 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.550
provides enough of a framework enough of
a framework to understand the natural

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560
a framework to understand the natural
 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.640
a framework to understand the natural
world to enable me to focus on what I am

interested in which is the way that
humans behave within that natural world

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370
humans behave within that natural world
 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.550
humans behave within that natural world
under the constraint that it imposes on

in what I don't have strong views about
 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.650
in what I don't have strong views about
are the motivations of human beings

Hobbesian in other words I think that
 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.590
Hobbesian in other words I think that
the state of nature is pretty ugly and

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600
the state of nature is pretty ugly and

our natural impulses in I'm prepared to

our natural impulses in I'm prepared to
 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.449
our natural impulses in I'm prepared to
be argued out of that in other words if

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459
be argued out of that in other words if
 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.310
be argued out of that in other words if
somebody can persuade me that in fact

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320
somebody can persuade me that in fact
 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.810
somebody can persuade me that in fact
human beings and matronly have a

cooperation rather than killing one
 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.520
cooperation rather than killing one
another and that they're killing one

another is the exception rather than

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910
another is the exception rather than
 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.350
another is the exception rather than
norm then I will certainly listen and

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360
norm then I will certainly listen and
 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.760
norm then I will certainly listen and
and and be prepared to be convinced
