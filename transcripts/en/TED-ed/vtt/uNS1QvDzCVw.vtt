00:00:06.954 --> 00:00:09.124
Pick a card, any card.

00:00:09.124 --> 00:00:12.014
Actually, just pick up all of them and take a look.

00:00:12.014 --> 00:00:15.848
This standard 52-card deck has been used for centuries.

00:00:15.848 --> 00:00:18.098
Everyday, thousands just like it

00:00:18.098 --> 00:00:21.134
are shuffled in casinos all over the world,

00:00:21.134 --> 00:00:23.719
the order rearranged each time.

00:00:23.719 --> 00:00:26.431
And yet, every time you pick up a well-shuffled deck

00:00:26.431 --> 00:00:27.642
like this one,

00:00:27.642 --> 00:00:29.431
you are almost certainly holding

00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:30.848
an arrangement of cards

00:00:30.848 --> 00:00:33.729
that has never before existed in all of history.

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:35.764
How can this be?

00:00:35.764 --> 00:00:37.900
The answer lies in how many different arrangements

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.348
of 52 cards, or any objects, are possible.

00:00:42.348 --> 00:00:45.620
Now, 52 may not seem like such a high number,

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.035
but let's start with an even smaller one.

00:00:48.035 --> 00:00:49.932
Say we have four people trying to sit

00:00:49.932 --> 00:00:52.348
in four numbered chairs.

00:00:52.348 --> 00:00:54.460
How many ways can they be seated?

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.598
To start off, any of the four people can sit

00:00:56.598 --> 00:00:57.920
in the first chair.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.132
One this choice is made,

00:00:59.132 --> 00:01:01.466
only three people remain standing.

00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:03.262
After the second person sits down,

00:01:03.262 --> 00:01:05.219
only two people are left as candidates

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:06.680
for the third chair.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.680
And after the third person has sat down,

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.431
the last person standing has no choice

00:01:10.431 --> 00:01:12.347
but to sit in the fourth chair.

00:01:12.347 --> 00:01:15.098
If we manually write out all the possible arrangements,

00:01:15.098 --> 00:01:16.814
or permutations,

00:01:16.814 --> 00:01:18.818
it turns out that there are 24 ways

00:01:18.818 --> 00:01:22.180
that four people can be seated into four chairs,

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.991
but when dealing with larger numbers,

00:01:23.991 --> 00:01:25.532
this can take quite a while.

00:01:25.532 --> 00:01:27.848
So let's see if there's a quicker way.

00:01:27.848 --> 00:01:29.286
Going from the beginning again,

00:01:29.286 --> 00:01:31.370
you can see that each of the four initial choices

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.682
for the first chair

00:01:32.682 --> 00:01:35.999
leads to three more possible choices for the second chair,

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:37.461
and each of those choices

00:01:37.461 --> 00:01:39.847
leads to two more for the third chair.

00:01:39.847 --> 00:01:43.181
So instead of counting each final scenario individually,

00:01:43.181 --> 00:01:46.262
we can multiply the number of choices for each chair:

00:01:46.262 --> 00:01:49.096
four times three times two times one

00:01:49.096 --> 00:01:51.848
to achieve the same result of 24.

00:01:51.848 --> 00:01:53.681
An interesting pattern emerges.

00:01:53.681 --> 00:01:56.729
We start with the number of objects we're arranging,

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.098
four in this case,

00:01:58.098 --> 00:02:00.847
and multiply it by consecutively smaller integers

00:02:00.847 --> 00:02:02.902
until we reach one.

00:02:02.902 --> 00:02:04.514
This is an exciting discovery.

00:02:04.514 --> 00:02:06.449
So exciting that mathematicians have chosen

00:02:06.449 --> 00:02:08.575
to symbolize this kind of calculation,

00:02:08.575 --> 00:02:10.345
known as a factorial,

00:02:10.345 --> 00:02:12.038
with an exclamation mark.

00:02:12.038 --> 00:02:15.514
As a general rule, the factorial of any positive integer

00:02:15.514 --> 00:02:17.416
is calculated as the product

00:02:17.416 --> 00:02:18.876
of that same integer

00:02:18.876 --> 00:02:21.836
and all smaller integers down to one.

00:02:21.836 --> 00:02:23.263
In our simple example,

00:02:23.263 --> 00:02:24.596
the number of ways four people

00:02:24.596 --> 00:02:26.181
can be arranged into chairs

00:02:26.181 --> 00:02:28.052
is written as four factorial,

00:02:28.052 --> 00:02:29.975
which equals 24.

00:02:29.975 --> 00:02:31.808
So let's go back to our deck.

00:02:31.808 --> 00:02:33.598
Just as there were four factorial ways

00:02:33.598 --> 00:02:35.431
of arranging four people,

00:02:35.431 --> 00:02:37.598
there are 52 factorial ways

00:02:37.598 --> 00:02:40.014
of arranging 52 cards.

00:02:40.014 --> 00:02:43.066
Fortunately, we don't have to calculate this by hand.

00:02:43.066 --> 00:02:45.014
Just enter the function into a calculator,

00:02:45.014 --> 00:02:46.431
and it will show you that the number of

00:02:46.431 --> 00:02:47.931
possible arrangements is

00:02:47.931 --> 00:02:52.368
8.07 x 10^67,

00:02:52.368 --> 00:02:55.788
or roughly eight followed by 67 zeros.

00:02:55.788 --> 00:02:57.458
Just how big is this number?

00:02:57.458 --> 00:02:59.708
Well, if a new permutation of 52 cards

00:02:59.708 --> 00:03:01.752
were written out every second

00:03:01.752 --> 00:03:04.378
starting 13.8 billion years ago,

00:03:04.378 --> 00:03:06.344
when the Big Bang is thought to have occurred,

00:03:06.344 --> 00:03:09.094
the writing would still be continuing today

00:03:09.094 --> 00:03:11.676
and for millions of years to come.

00:03:11.676 --> 00:03:13.426
In fact, there are more possible

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:16.345
ways to arrange this simple deck of cards

00:03:16.345 --> 00:03:18.593
than there are atoms on Earth.

00:03:18.593 --> 00:03:20.759
So the next time it's your turn to shuffle,

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:22.093
take a moment to remember

00:03:22.093 --> 00:03:23.174
that you're holding something that

00:03:23.174 --> 00:03:25.235
may have never before existed

00:03:25.235 --> 00:03:27.344
and may never exist again.
